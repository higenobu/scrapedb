4/14/2022,"The man suspected of firing more than 30 shots in a gun attack on a New York subway train has been charged with a federal terror offence. Frank R James, 62, was arrested on Wednesday afternoon on the Lower East Side in Manhattan by two patrol officers without incident and is being held at a local police precinct. At a press conference an hour or so after his arrest, law enforcement representatives said that the gun used in the attack, a 9mm Glock, was purchased by James in Ohio in 2011. Details of his criminal history include nine previous arrests in New York between 1992 and 1998 for crimes including burglary, theft and sexual attack, as well as three in New Jersey (1992, 1993 and 2007) for crimes including disorderly conduct and trespass. He does not have a felony record and he was not known to the FBI, officers said. James was detained close to where he was spotted just hours earlier by a member of the public, who took photographs and called NYPD’s crime stoppers. The 40-hour manhunt involved city, state and federal agencies, as well as help from the public. “We were able to shrink his world quickly, so he had nowhere left to turn,” said Letitia James, the state attorney general. “We could have not done this without the public’s help,” said the FBI officer at the press conference. James faces up to life in prison if he is convicted of a terrorist attack on mass transit, according to Breon S Peace, the US attorney for New York’s Eastern District. At least four schoolchildren aged 12 to 16 are believed to be among the 29 passengers injured requiring medical treatment after suffering from bullet wounds, smoke inhalation, falls and panic. Five of 10 people shot were reported to be in critical but stable condition; another 19 were injured, though nobody was reported to be in life-threatening condition. Law enforcement agencies urged the public to keep sending them footage from the crime scene and elsewhere as they try to piece together James’ movements before and after Tuesday’s mass shooting – the worst violent incident on the subway system in recent history. At least one camera at the subway station failed to capture anything during the attack due to a “malfunction”. So far they believe that James boarded an N train after firing 33 shots, but alighted at the next station, 25th street. James was named a suspect after police found a key to a U-Haul van at Tuesday’s crime scene which authorities said James rented in Philadelphia, as well as a 9mm semiautomatic handgun and extended magazines, a hatchet, fireworks, a liquid believed to be gasoline, a black garbage can, and detonated and undetonated smoke grenades. It’s unclear where or how he obtained the weapon. Authorities had offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to the capture of the gunman, who was wearing a gas mask as he fired 33 shots on the packed train, in what is the worst violent incident on public transit in recent history. On 4/12/22 at 8:30 AM, Frank Robert James fired numerous gun shots inside an ""N"" line subway car at 36th St & 4th Ave subway station causing serious injuries to 10 people. Anyone with info about the incident or his whereabouts should contact @NYPDTips or call 1-800-577-TIPS. pic.twitter.com/MaeF16i4bX James, who has links to Wisconsin, Philadelphia, Ohio, New York and New Jersey, has posted dozens of bizarre rambling videos on social media in recent years in which he has expressed a range of bigoted views on topics ranging from mental health services, death and race to Ukraine. Police released a screenshot of James taken from a YouTube video posted by a channel belonging to the username prophetoftruth88. In a video posted last month, James singled out the city’s new mayor, Eric Adams, by name, criticizing his recently announced public safety policies targeting homeless people in the subway. The security detail for Adams, who is at home recovering from Covid, will be strengthened in light of the videos, according to New York’s police commissioner, Keechant Sewell. In a video posted on Monday, James said he had experienced the desire to kill people but he didn’t want to go to jail. In one uploaded on 18 March from a rented white van, James sounds relaxed as he rambles about a range of topics, including moving out of his apartment, workplace troubles, the state of humanity, the climate crisis and overpopulation. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, one neighbor told the New York Times that James walked with a limp, and described him as quiet and unthreatening, while another said he was grumpy, standoffish and weird. Amid growing concern by campaigners that the shooting will lead to Adams deploying even more police on the streets and subway, Jamaal Bowman, democratic representative for the north Bronx and southern half of Westchester county, called for caution in an interview with CNN: “This was a horrible attack and that person needs to be held accountable but then we need to move on.” Bowman, who has called for a decrease in police, especially in poor communities, added: “Police are one part of the solution but they are not the only solution. They cannot work in silos, they have to work with education officials, clergy, workforce development and mental health professionals so that we do a better job identifying people at risk.” In an earlier interview on WNYC, Adams said that the city was exploring new gun detection technologies for the subway, which could be piloted soon. He also said the state, not the city, was responsible for cameras on the subway system. As law enforcement searched for James, the subway service seemed back to normal at the 36th Street station in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. On Tuesday, graphic images had shown chaotic scenes on the platform after the mass shooting, with wounded passengers lying on the ground as others administered tourniquets to stem bleeding from their legs. Other footage recorded as the train pulled into the station showed black smoke pouring out as the doors opened, followed by passengers, some screaming, others stumbling and falling to the platform. Phone images showed blood on the floor of the car. Police presence on the subway was beefed up overnight, but Tuesday’s terrifying incident follows a spate of random attacks on the subway, which will not help government efforts to convince people that the city’s underground transport system is safe. At least a third of New Yorkers – about 3 million people – ride the subway, but passenger numbers are still down more than 40% compared with pre-pandemic numbers.",News/US news,New York police arrest man wanted in Brooklyn subway shooting,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/13/brooklyn-subway-shooting-suspect-new-york-latest
4/14/2022,"Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Tory leader, has renewed her calls for Boris Johnson to resign over the Partygate scandal as she accused him of “traducing” the office of prime minister. One of the first Tories to call for his resignation when the scandal broke, Davidson echoed a handful of Tory MPs who confirmed on Wednesday they stood by their no-confidence letters after Johnson’s fine for breaching his government’s Covid rules. Now a Tory peer, she said the prime minister had “made a mockery” of the British public’s sacrifices during the pandemic, opening up a split with Douglas Ross, her close ally and successor as Scottish Conservative leader. In an interview with STV, she called for Johnson to resign. “He spoke to both the country and the parliament and said that no rules had been broken and they clearly had been, and he’s not corrected the record,” said Davidson. “So, I think under those circumstances, he should go.” Ross was the first Tory MP to publicly urge Johnson to quit in January but has since withdrawn his no-confidence letter to the 1922 Committee, arguing it would boost Vladimir Putin if the British prime minister was forced out of office during the war in Ukraine. Speaking as the pair campaigned together in Edinburgh before May’s local council elections, Ross hinted his support for the prime minister was temporary and conditional, but refused to discuss what action he might take in future. He said his current support for the prime minister was not a “free pass” but that questions about Johnson’s fate after the Ukraine war was over – or if the Tories fared disastrously in May’s council elections, as many polls predicted – were “hypothetical”. Ross said voters were justifiably “angry, furious, they’re livid” at the fines issued to the prime minister, the chancellor and a host of Downing Street officials. “I share a lot of that anger and fury but I also have to look at the situation in Ukraine. I wish that wasn’t happening.” A series of Scottish opinion polls this year put the Tories third behind Labour for the first time in five years, threatening to end the Tories’ series of strong Scottish election results. Opposition parties believe the Partygate scandal has significantly dented the Conservative’s popular support; Labour and the Liberal Democrat both say they are picking up votes across Scotland. If true, that implies Davidson’s decision to publicly disagree with her close ally’s stance on the prime minister has tactical value for the Tories, by indicating to disillusioned voters the Conservatives remain unhappy and critical of Johnson’s conduct. Downplaying the polls, Ross said that Johnson resigning would “create a void, would create instability … allies around the world would know he’s about to leave. And the most important person in all of this – Vladimir Putin – would know he’s about to leave and that instability would undermine everything the west is trying to do to help President Zelenskiy and the people of Ukraine.” Davidson said that if Johnson was sincere about wanting to uphold the law over Ukraine, he should start with his own conduct. “I don’t think the prime minister’s apology last night [over being fined] was anything other than contrite and meaningful and I’m sure he is very sorry for what’s happened but I believe that the prime minister should lead by example,” she said. “I believe that the office of the prime minister is traduced when you’ve got somebody that breaks the laws that they himself have brought in and I completely understand that there are really big geopolitics happening. Right now. There are big international issues. But I still believe that when it comes to supporting a country fighting for freedom and democracy, you have to uphold your own rules. You have to.”",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson ‘made a mockery’ of UK’s Covid sacrifices, says Ruth Davidson",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/13/boris-johnson-covid-fine-uk-ruth-davidson
4/14/2022,"Boris Johnson is facing another three potential fines for lockdown breaches, according to senior sources, as he suffered his first ministerial resignation over the Partygate scandal. In a sign of the continued nervousness in government that the prime minister’s position could come under threat when MPs return to Westminster from recess next week, a Downing Street source admitted the apparent lull felt like “calm before the potential storm”. Lords justice minister David Wolfson quit his role on Wednesday following the news that Johnson and Rishi Sunak had been given a fixed-penalty notice for breaking their own Covid laws by attending a party for the prime minister’s birthday in No 10. Wolfson said he was resigning not only because of the prime minister’s “own conduct” but also “the official response to what took place”. He said the behaviour stood in stark contrast to many in society who “complied with the rules at great personal cost, and others were fined or prosecuted for similar, and sometimes apparently more trivial, offences”. Johnson sought to rally senior ministers behind him by holding a virtual cabinet on Wednesday afternoon. The Welsh secretary, Simon Hart, said Johnson would not quit even if he received multiple fines. “I don’t necessarily see the difference between one or two,” he told Times Radio. By Wednesday afternoon, before Wolfson’s resignation, momentum appeared to have stalled for MPs prepared to oust Johnson – just two Tory MPs added their voices to calls for the prime minister to resign, the Amber Valley MP Nigel Mills and Craig Whittaker, the MP for Calder Valley. Mills said he would be writing a letter of no confidence to the chair of the 1922 Committee: “I think for a prime minister in office to be given a fine and accept it and pay it for breaking the laws that he introduced … is just an impossible position,” he said. In the Halifax Courier, Whittaker called for the PM to resign and “do the right thing” – though said he would not write a letter of no confidence, predicting that Johnson would win any vote. On social media, the majority of MPs rallied to Johnson’s defence. But a former No 10 adviser predicted the fines could still prove “fatal” for the prime minister’s career. “Conservatives, if they stand for anything, stand for the rule of law and the maintenance of order,” they said. “If they cannot abide their own rules, and do not show humility in the face of justice, it is impossible for them to maintain that mantle.” Key insiders said they believed Johnson was likely to receive at least three more fines for events that have not yet been fully investigated by police. The events that the Metropolitan police have yet to examine, which Johnson attended, include the May 2020 summer party, a November gathering in Johnson’s flat with his wife on the day of Dominic Cummings’ departure, and a leaving do for a senior aide in No 10 a day later. Sources said no attender had yet received a fine for those events. Some Tories have expressed concern that Johnson’s strategy has been to downplay the significance of the event for which he was fined – a short birthday gathering in the cabinet room. “It’s been a terrible comms blunder for MPs to be briefed that the event only lasted 10 minutes and that the PM has been unfairly maligned,” one Tory source said. Lord Frost, the former cabinet minister, also expressed concern that further damaging revelations were to come. “I think it’s not possible just to say, ‘That was then, this is now, let’s move on, the world is different,’ as the government is trying to this morning,” he told LBC. “We don’t yet know what other penalties may be issued, and to whom.” No 10 sources said the prime minister had attended the birthday gathering in the cabinet room in June 2020 for less than 10 minutes, eating salad from a plastic bowl and declining any alcohol or party food. But those who attended the birthday party for the prime minister say they have raised eyebrows at the description of the gathering, with one describing it as a “party atmosphere” with singing, attended by his wife, Carrie Johnson, and his interior designer Lulu Lytle. Another said they believe photos taken of the event by Johnson’s personal photographer – which have been disclosed to the official Sue Gray investigation into lockdown parties – would leave it beyond doubt that it was an event that breached the rules. One policing source said an assessment by Met detectives that the PM breached the rules more than once would increase future fines. The level of fine would go up each time Johnson was found to have, or accepted that he had, breached the rules he had introduced. The source added that the defence Johnson and his supporters were making, that people did not realise they were at parties, was “specious” because the raft of rules were written to stop any indoor gathering of people: “The law never talked about parties, it talked about gatherings. It does not have to be music and dancing – you could not gather indoors. “The whole reason was to stop the transmission of the disease. The disregard for public health is startling. Why would you not know you were breaching the rules?” Though three MPs who have previously called for Johnson to go said the war in Ukraine meant they did not believe it was the right moment for a contest, others stood by their letters of no confidence on Thursday, including Gary Streeter, Caroline Nokes, Anthony Mangnall and Tobias Ellwood. Another MP said they were deeply worried about further revelations and a “drip-drip” ahead of the local elections and the final Gray report. “Each one of these will come as a hammer into the nail of the Tory coffin and what the PM is doing is implicating all the MPs in this. We are in an a long, slow death march.” The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has also apologised for breaching the rules, having received a fixed-penalty notice for attending the gathering, after a seven-hour deliberation during which he is reported to have been considering his position. Allies of Sunak said on Wednesday they believed it had been a missed opportunity for the chancellor not to resign on Tuesday after he receiving the fixed-penalty notice. “My view is he should have gone months ago and kept his integrity intact, but now he is at the mercy of potentially being sacked this summer,” one said.",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson could get three more fines over Partygate, say insiders",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/13/boris-johnson-could-get-three-more-fines-over-partygate-say-insiders
4/14/2022,"My friend Bernard Brown, who has died aged 77, was a teacher and linguist who grew up in Britain but moved to Germany in his 20s and happily adapted to his new country. He was impressed with the way Germany had made amends for its Nazi past, and, rediscovering his Jewish roots late in life, became affiliated to the Ohel Jakob synagogue in Munich, which had been rebuilt with state assistance. As well as English and German, Bernard spoke Hebrew, French and Italian and had an acquaintance with several other languages. He was fascinated by what the structures of language revealed about the cultures connected to them, and planned a book on the subject which, as he preferred conversation to writing, was never completed. Bernard was born in Thornton Heath, south London, to Eve (nee Finch), a schoolteacher, and her husband, Reg Brown, a builder. He was educated at Norbury Manor school and John Ruskin school, then graduated from Keele University in 1968 with a degree in history and politics, which he followed up with an MA in European studies at Reading University in 1969. He spent the ﬁrst years of his career teaching English to adults in Britain, Italy and France, before settling in what was then West Germany, where one of his early language students was Erika Hänsle, whom he married in 1975. Thereafter he taught at the Beruﬂiche Oberschule, a vocational college in Bad Tölz, Bavaria, where he became head of English. Bernard also ran workshops for teachers in Germany, Austria and Italy, and self-published a number of idiosyncratic books with titles such as The Pleasure Principle and Begin With a Smile, designed to reduce anxiety in language learning and which he used in his workshops. Having been profoundly affected by a feeling of rejection after failing the 11-plus exam at school, he disliked streaming and strongly opposed IQ testing. He also believed that with the right methods every student can learn, and devoted time and effort to helping the weakest and least motivated in his classrooms. When I first met Bernard at Keele, I was baffled by the contradiction between his gentleness and his involvement in Trotskyist politics, which he had inherited from his parents. But he was a critical thinker and was amused to have been expelled from every Trotskyist group in Britain before he was 25. He always regarded himself as a Sixty-Eighter and never abandoned his ideals. In his later years he became active in the SPD, the Social Democratic party of Germany. He is survived by Erika, their sons, Andreas, Ruben and Daniel, his brother Vincent and sisters Helen and Miriam.",News/Education,Bernard Brown obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/13/bernard-brown-obituary
4/14/2022,"More than 1,000 Ukrainian marines defending the besieged city of Mariupol have surrendered and the port has been captured, Moscow has said, as the presidents of four countries bordering Russia arrived in Kyiv in a show of support for Ukraine. In one of the most critical battles of the war, Russia’s defence ministry said that on Wednesday 1,026 soldiers from Ukraine’s 36th Marine Brigade, including 162 officers, had “voluntarily laid down their arms” near the city’s Ilyich iron and steelworks. It later said Mariupol’s “trade sea port” was under full control of Russian forces. There was no independent confirmation of the claims. Ukraine’s defence ministry said it had no information about the surrender and the Ukrainian military command said only that Russian forces were attacking the Azovstal industrial area and the port. The Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, who says his forces are playing a major role in the battle, urged the last Ukrainians holed up in Azovstal to surrender. The 26th Marine Brigade had said on Monday that it was preparing for a final battle in Mariupol. The city, the main target yet to be brought under Russian control in the eastern Donbas region, has been encircled and largely reduced to rubble during Moscow’s seven-week invasion. The city’s mayor has said 21,000 civilians have died and more than 100,000 remain there awaiting evacuation. Its capture would be the first fall of a major Ukrainian city and would help Russia secure a land passage between the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk in Donbas and Crimea, which Moscow occupied and annexed in 2014. Joe Biden announced $800m in new US military aid to Ukraine on Wednesday. He said this would include artillery, armoured personnel carriers and helicopters. Biden added it would “contain many of the highly effective weapons systems we have already provided and new capabilities tailored to the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine”. The Polish and Baltic presidents headed to the Ukrainian capital by train on Wednesday to show support for the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and his embattled troops in what the Polish presidential adviser Jakub Kumoch called “this decisive moment for the country”. The Polish president, Andrzej Duda, Estonia’s Alar Karis, Gitanas Nausėda of Lithuania and Latvia’s Egils Levits met in the Polish city of Rzeszów near the Ukrainian border. “Heading to Kyiv with a strong message of political support and military assistance,” Nausėda tweeted from the station. The programme of the visit by the leaders of four Nato member states – who fear they may face Russian attacks if Ukraine falls – was not disclosed for security reasons but local media reported that the heads of state visited Borodianka, near Kyiv. Nausėda said the town was “permeated with pain and suffering” after “civilian Ukrainians were murdered and tortured there, and residential homes and other civilian infrastructure were bombed”. He said it was “hard to believe that such war atrocities could be perpetrated in 21st-century Europe, but that is the reality. This is a war we must win.” The visit followed Kyiv’s reported refusal to meet the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who visited Poland on Tuesday and said he had planned to go on to Ukraine but “was not wanted”. The former foreign minister is facing heavy criticism for his past policy of rapprochement towards Moscow. On Wednesday, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said it was “confusing” that Steinmeier had not been received in Kyiv. Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany said the government would be glad to welcome Scholz, but diplomats said the snub to Steinmeier may make that more difficult. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, declined on Wednesday to repeat Biden’s accusation that Russia was carrying out “genocide” against Ukrainians, warning that verbal escalations would not help end the war. The US president said on Tuesday it had “become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being able to be a Ukrainian”. Macron said it was important for leaders to be careful with language. “I would say that Russia unilaterally unleashed the most brutal war, that it is now established that war crimes were committed by the Russian army and that it is now necessary to find those responsible and make them face justice,” he said. After visiting Bucha – the site of mass killings of Ukrainian civilians – Duda told a news conference: “This is not war, this is terrorism.” The Polish leader said that the perpetrators and those who had given orders had to be brought to justice. Zelenskiy told Estonian MPs on Wednesday, without providing evidence, that Russia was using phosphorus bombs in Ukraine. Ukrainian forces in Mariupol said a drone had dropped a poisonous substance on the city, but there has been no independent confirmation that Russia used banned chemical weapons. While Russian troops have largely withdrawn from around Ukraine’s capital in the face of stiff resistance and logistical problems, western officials and analysts say the invasion force is gearing up for a major offensive in the east. Military experts say local support, logistics, the terrain in the region and the appointment by Moscow of a new senior general, Aleksandr Dvornikov, could improve the performance of a force that Britain’s defence ministry said on Wednesday had so far been “hampered by an inability to cohere and coordinate”. Ukraine’s armed forces command said Russian forces were fully ready for a fresh assault in the eastern Donetsk and southern Kherson regions. “In the Donetsk and Tavria [Kherson] directions, according to available information, the enemy is ready for offensive actions,” the armed forces said in a Facebook post. The Russian retreat from around Kyiv has led to the discovery of large numbers of apparently massacred civilians, drawing international condemnation and calls for a war crimes investigation. The Kyiv district police chief said on Wednesday that 720 bodies had been found around the capital, and more than 200 people were missing. An expert report commissioned by the Vienna-based OSCE security and human rights organisation published on Wednesday found “clear patterns of (international humanitarian law) violations by the Russian forces in their conduct of hostilities”. It said there had also been also violations by Ukraine, but concluded those committed by Russia were “by far larger in scale and nature”. Ukraine has previously acknowledged there could be “isolated incidents” of violations and said it would investigate. Moscow, however, has rejected all allegations of atrocities and Vladimir Putin dismissed the reports as “fakes”. The Russian president said on Tuesday that Moscow would “rhythmically and calmly” continue its operation, which the UN says has so far driven more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes, more than 4.6 million of whom have fled abroad.",News/World news,"More than 1,000 Ukraine marines have surrendered in Mariupol, says Russia",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/more-than-1000-ukraine-marines-have-surrendered-in-mariupol-says-russia
4/14/2022,"One of the most senior Cabinet Office directors is a non-dom, the Guardian can reveal, in a disclosure which comes as Labour vowed to crack down on the favourable tax status. Anand Aithal, a former Goldman Sachs managing director, is the lead non-executive director at the Cabinet Office, a role which a Whitehall source said meant he had significant responsibilities in the department and a close relationship with the Downing Street chief of staff, Steve Barclay. A Cabinet Office spokesman said Aithal, who is domiciled in India, paid “all taxes on all of his income, both from the UK and abroad, in the UK”. Aithal was born in the UK but acquired the status through his Indian-born father. The revelation is likely to lead to further questions about the criteria for holding non-dom status. Last week it was revealed that Rishi Sunak’s wife Akshata Murty, who receives about £11.5m in annual dividends from her stake in the Indian IT services company Infosys, declares non-dom status. She has since said she will pay tax on all overseas income in the UK. Non-executive directors of government departments have been criticised in the past for being expressly politically-motivated appointments. Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, was last year found to have appointed his aide and lover, Gina Coladangelo, to the role at the Department of Health and Social Care. Last year the Institute for Government found a fifth of Whitehall’s non-executive directors appointed to oversee the work of government departments have “significant political experience or party alignment” – almost all of them with the Tory party. Their appointments are not regulated in the same way as other senior Whitehall posts. A person with non-dom status must demonstrate to HMRC that their domicile – at least for tax purposes – is in another country. Usually their domicile will be the country that their father considered their permanent home when they were born, and to which they intend to eventually return, perhaps when they retire. Aithal’s government profile describes him as having lived and worked in the USA, Singapore, Hong Kong, India, Sri Lanka and Costa Rica. After leaving Goldman Sachs he founded a data analytics firm providing data services on three continents before being acquired by Moody’s Inc. He has been on the board of the Cabinet Office since 2019. On Wednesday the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, hinted that Labour would propose a crackdown on non-dom status after it finalised its policy review on the tax system. “I’m very clear, if you live in this country, you should pay your full taxes here and that goes on non-dom status, tax havens, trusts and all the rest of it,” she said. “Gordon Brown cracked down on some of these rules and an incoming Labour government would go further. If you live in this country, you should pay your full taxes here, not just some of your taxes, and Labour would change the rules so that was the case.” Chris Bryant, the chair of both the standards and privileges committees, said: “It feels like nobody in government understands how this looks to ordinary voters who cannot choose where they pay their tax or how much they pay. You would have thought by now they would realise this is a country where people expect everyone to put their shoulder to the wheel.”",News/UK news,Senior Cabinet Office director Anand Aithal has non-dom status,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/13/senior-cabinet-office-director-anand-aithal-has-non-dom-status
4/14/2022,"“It all started in the early 90s,” says Armand Ossey. “I was only a teenager at the time, but like almost all my teammates, we saw this take over our football.” Born in Libreville, Gabon’s capital, Ossey, a footballer who went on to play for Grenoble and Rouen in France and Moreirense in Portugal, is one of the few players in Gabon to have spoken publicly about allegations of sexual abuse in football, a subject which he describes as “absolute taboo”. “The feeling of shame predominates,” he says. “A lot of my friends have been there and don’t want to talk about it. Explaining this in our society is not easy. That’s why I’m talking too.” The same story has been repeated by many players who have contacted the Guardian since we revealed that Patrick Assoumou Eyi – often known as “Capello” – was accused in December 2021 of raping, grooming and exploiting young players. Eyi was arrested and charged in Gabon. It is understood that Eyi is awaiting sentencing after admitting the charges against him. The Guardian has spoken to more than 30 players who have opened up about the sexual abuse they say they have suffered in the Gabonese football system. The players’ allegations span three decades and relate to a large number of people. This is how, the alleged victims argue, it has been able to continue for so long. The new allegations include claims against a prominent Gabonese politician, a coach working in the country and an agent living in France. The claims have been denied by all the men. Fifpro, the international players’ union, expressed “deep concerns” over the handling of an investigation by Gabon’s football federation, Fegafoot, into allegations of widespread sexual abuse “over at least the last two decades”. It called on Fifa to intervene after several victims and multiple witnesses gave testimonies that detailed “a series of high-profile and serial abusers, who are deeply embedded in Gabonese footballing structures”. Fifa has yet to respond to a request for comment. Ossey claims one of the instigators was a Cameroonian who coached at USM Libreville, a leading club in Gabon. Ossey says: “We called him ‘Prési’, but in reality, his name was Jean Bahoken. He made me strip naked, put me in front of pornographic films and tried to abuse me.” Ossey says he was “lucky” to escape the worst. “Prési was one of the main abusers,” says Juste, a player who has spent his career in Gabon. “When I was at USM, he called me into his office. He said to me: ‘You are a good player, but you lack presence of mind!’ That was their phrase used by him and Capello: presence of mind. According to them, they had to infuse us with ‘presence of mind’ by abusing us. They said this is what was going to make me a great player who could withstand the pressure.” Bahoken died when he returned to Cameroon in the early 2000s. But witnesses allege Eyi, who knew Bahoken, continued a campaign of abuse. Eyi, a former boy scout who performed as an acrobat for the cirque de l’Équateur, which has represented Gabon at international festivals since the 1990s, started coaching at Orambaka and took charge of some of the country’s best young talents. “We had an incredible team,” recalls Shiva Star N’Zigou, a striker who went on to play for Nantes and Gabon. “Eyi made me proposals, like many other people. It’s an open secret. The 90s were the beginning of paedophilia in Gabonese football.” Alleged victims say Eyi promised a career to players from disadvantaged backgrounds, but imposed conditions for playing. “He told us about the great players who had slept with him to appease us,” says a victim who preferred to remain anonymous. “I let myself be taken in like that. He quoted names to me, called a club in France in front of me … I was a child, I told myself that this was really how you made a career. So when the possibility of an international tournament arose, we did not think about the conditions.” In this case, it was the Montaigu tournament in France – one of the most important in the world for the under-17 age group. “Montaigu was a unique opportunity to show us,” N’Zigou says. “All the young people wanted to go there.” Alleged victims claim that Guy Mandarano, a businessman who also acts as an agent, also abused them at Montaigu. “He started at the start of the 90s and did not hide,” says one. “To go to France, we had no choice anyway, he told us.” Mandarano, founder of the Ermöglichen club in Gabon, represented the gateway to Europe dreamed of by so many young players. “He is one of the bosses of Gabonese football,” maintains a player who says he was sexually abused by Mandarono when he started puberty. “I was 13 or 14 … He told me that there were conditions, that professional players must do things to reach the top level. He mentioned names to me, even a Gabonese international, which reassured me. In Ermöglichen, it was the norm and we accepted it.” Several other alleged victims have made similar claims about Mandarano, who lives in France. He told the Guardian the allegations were “a tissue of lies”. “How could I encourage or deliver my players to be traumatised and sexually abused? Doing this is going against my dream,” he said. The former Gabon striker Brice Makaya was part of the Panthers’ team that reached the quarter-finals of the 1996 Africa Cup Nations. He says he voiced his concerns over alleged sexual abuse in 2014 when employed as a coach by Fegafoot. “I did not wait for the scandal to alert the authorities of our football,” he says. “During a match in Ethiopia with the Under-17 selection where I was assistant to Eyi, I showed a young person’s phone to Pierre-Alain Mounguengui, the president of Fegafoot. Eyi had sent photos of a man with a wig and lipstick to a young kid, telling him that he too had a nice mouth and that he wanted to kiss it. And I was told that was not proof …” Engouma Bertrand, Fegafoot’s technical director at Fegafoot and regional technical director of the province of Ogooué-Ivindo, is alleged by several of the 30 players interviewed to have also abused players while he was employed at USM between 2006 and 2015. In 2016 he moved to Fegafoot. “This gentleman is a monster but he still works at the federation,” claims a former player. Bertrand – known as “Nono del Bosque” – did not respond to questions from the Guardian. Hervé Patrick Opiangah, the president of Mounana, a club from south-eastern Gabon, has been accused by players of abusing them. After a stay of 15 months in the central prison of Libreville in the mid-2000s for financial crimes, Opiangah became a significant figure in politics and Gabonese football. “He was general manager of the selection when I knew him,” says a former international player. “He more or less decided who came or not to the national team. He called me personally when I was in Europe, and he was clear. I was good, yes, but I had to go into his bed.” Another former player from Mounana also told a similar story. “He made me go into his office,” he says. “He said to me: ‘This is how it is. You want to play? Want a contract? I decide.’ He told me he wanted to sleep with me – when I refused, he kicked me out of Mounana. I was in another club, and I assure you that I did not play because he called people. This man is so powerful … Everyone is afraid of him in Gabonese football.” Opiangah refused to answer questions when contacted by the Guardian. But after being included on a list of alleged offenders circulated on social media in December, he described the claims as a “hateful campaign of slanderous denunciation, which is not based on any specific facts” that had tried to “unfairly defame personalities known for their dedication to the cause [of] football , for no other reason than to smear their person and tarnish their image”. Parfait Ndong, a former Gabon international who spent most of his career in Portugal, returned to the country to open his Jardin de football du Gabon academy in 2018. He says he raised the alarm then. “I alerted Fegafoot president Mounguengui to the sexual abuse, but what was done? Nothing. All Gabonese football is aware of these problems of paedophilia, but nothing has been done for our children.” An exasperated Ndong spoke publicly in Gabon, “which earned me threats”. Mounguengui, who will attempt to secure a third term as president at elections this month, did not respond to questions from the Guardian. Another coach, Lazare Nguema, has been accused by young players of sexually abusing and harassing them since starting to work for the League de l’Estuaire in 2019. One alleged victim said: “He made advances to me, told me that I wouldn’t go anywhere if I didn’t work with him. I went to his house once and he asked me to undress to see if I was in good physical condition. Then he wanted to mount me. I pushed him away, and I was able to get away from him. I jumped out of the window, I didn’t even have time to get dressed. Since that day, he continues to harass me, telling me that he is my only hope if I want to play football. I stopped everything.” Nguema denied the accusations and told the Guardian that he had been the subject of “arbitrary false accusations and several people are mobilised in order to harm me, going so far as to quote my name in acts of paedophilia on social networks. I am the main delegate of the Gabonese coaches’ union which is trying to get the current Gabonese football federation to leave before the election scheduled for April.” Fegafoot said in a statement: “For several months Gabonese justice has been active. Thus the judicial police and the counter-interference are carrying out investigations, the public prosecutor has made a public statement on this subject, inviting the [alleged] victims to approach justice and an investigating judge is in charge of this file. “The hearings of several actors from the world of sport and football in particular are in progress. To date several arrests have been made. In addition, the federation’s ethics committee has opened an investigation, Fifa has been active and is following this file.”",Sport/Sport,‘Explaining this is not easy’: how sexual abuse allegations rocked football in Gabon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/13/how-sexual-abuse-allegations-rocked-football-in-gabon
4/14/2022,"Marine Le Pen’s plan for a new partnership with a post-Brexit Britain is dangerous for France, ignorant and completely misunderstands the basis of British alliances, Peter Ricketts, the former UK national security adviser and UK ambassador to France, has told the Guardian. He said the far-right presidential hopeful’s proposals represented a plan for French isolation from its main strategic partners, the US, Germany and the UK. In her defence manifesto, Le Pen held out the hope of a restored Lancaster House treaty, the Franco-British defence cooperation treaty first signed in 2010, and underlined this by illustrating her defence plans with a picture of the union jack and tricolour flags. Lord Ricketts described her proposals “as ignorant, superficial and completely misunderstanding the basis of France’s cooperations with all her allies”. “It is a recipe for disaster for France,” he said. “There is a lingering assumption in her proposals that a Brexit Britain will be a natural ally for a nationalist Le Pen France. “But what her proposals bring out is that France under her leadership would be a very dangerous ally for the UK with her plan of leaving the Nato military command structure, renegotiating its alliance with America, being much more nationalistic in its purchase of defence equipment and continuing a strategic partnership with Russia in all sorts of areas.” He added: “It is frankly inconceivable that she would be able to drive a wedge between the US and the UK. “She has an idea that if the UK wants to have a close alliance with a Le Pen France, the UK should show goodwill by buying French equipment, such as the Exocet, and ditching US defence equipment. There is also talk of abandoning the Franco-British Joint Expeditionary Force since she sees it of no practical purpose. “No British government or indeed any Nato ally is going to touch a defence relationship with France on those grounds. It shows a complete misunderstanding if she thinks Britain would be interested in a defence relationship on Le Pen’s basis.” He added: “France’s closest military allies are the US, the UK and Germany, yet her suggestion is the foundations of all these agreements can and will be changed. It is a recipe for complete isolation for France. She treats Germany [with] short shrift. The US has to accept France’s withdrawal from Nato command structure whilst Britain in some way has to buy France’s partnership by buying French defence equipment, and not that of the US. “Apart from her relationship with Russia, I don’t see how any of France’s traditional alliances would survive her presidency. It would have been far better if she had been honest in her defence manifesto and replaced the union jack with the Russian flag, because that is the only potential ally she is likely to find.” Le Pen has already insisted that bilateral, as opposed to multilateral, relations will form the centrepiece of French foreign policy. But Ricketts said she seemed intent on undermining all of France’s most important bilateral relationships. Although Le Pen has insisted she is not interested in Frexit, her defence manifesto contains echoes of Boris Johnson’s Global Britain strategy paper by suggesting that France needs to extend its influence in the globe in new areas, including the Indo-Pacific. She seems willing to overlook the UK decision to form an alliance in the Indo-Pacific with Australia and the US, even though it carved France out of the region.",News/World news,Le Pen’s plans for post-Brexit treaty ‘ignorant and dangerous’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/le-pen-plans-post-brexit-treaty-ignorant-dangerous
4/14/2022,"Sarah Everard’s killer, Wayne Couzens, has requested a trial by jury to face four charges of indecent exposure. The alleged flashing incidents are said to have taken place in Swanley, Kent, in January and February last year while he was a serving Metropolitan police officer. He appeared at Westminster magistrates court on Wednesday afternoon by video link from Frankland prison, in Durham, sporting a long, bushy grey beard and wearing a grey prison-issue grey sweater. Couzens spoke to confirm his name and date of birth and gave no indication of pleas to any of the charges. The charges, which followed an investigation by the Met, state he allegedly “intentionally exposed his genitals intending that someone would see them and be caused alarm and distress”. The incidents are said to have taken place on four occasions in Swanley, Kent, between January and February 2021.Paul Goldspring, the chief magistrate, said the case was suitable for trial at the magistrates court but when asked by the legal adviser where he wanted the case to be heard, Couzens said: “My legal team have advised me at the crown court.” Goldspring sent the case to the Old Bailey, where Couzens will next appear on 11 May. He said: “Mr Couzens, you are charged with four offences relating to section 66 of the Sexual Offences Act. “You have given no indication as to plea in relation to these four matters. I determined that on their own, without what we know happened subsequently, they would be suitable for trial in this court. “As is your right, you have elected crown court trial.” Couzens, 49, is serving a whole-life sentence for the kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard on 3 March 2021, two weeks after the last alleged flashing incident. At the time of his arrest, days after Everard disappeared, he was serving in the parliamentary and diplomatic protection unit. Her remains were recovered from woodland near Ashford in Kent, about 20 miles west of Couzens’s home in Deal, a week after she disappeared.

4/14/2022,"Scientists believe they have found evidence of microbes that were thriving near hydrothermal vents on Earth’s surface just 300m years after the planet formed – the strongest evidence yet that life began far earlier than is widely assumed. If confirmed, it would suggest the conditions necessary for the emergence of life are relatively basic. “If life is relatively quick to emerge, given the right conditions, this increases the chance that life exists on other planets,” said Dominic Papineau, of University College London, who led the research. Five years ago, Papineau and colleagues announced they had found microfossils in iron-rich sedimentary rocks from the Nuvvuagittuq supracrustal belt in Quebec, Canada. The team suggested that these tiny filaments, knobs and tubes of an iron oxide called haematite could have been made by bacteria living around hydrothermal vents that used iron-based chemical reactions to obtain their energy. Scientific dating of the rocks has suggested they are at least 3.75bn years old, and possibly as old as 4.28bn years, the age of the volcanic rocks they are embedded in. Before this, the oldest reported microfossils dated to 3.46bn and 3.7bn years ago, potentially making the Canadian specimens the oldest direct evidence of life on Earth. Now, further analysis of the rock has revealed a much larger and more complex structure – a stem with parallel branches on one side that is nearly a centimetre long – as well as hundreds of distorted spheres, or ellipsoids, alongside the tubes and filaments. “One thing that I think is amazing is the sheer size of the tectonic branching structure, which is several millimetres, if not more than a centimetre in size,” said Papineau, adding that they bear some resemblance to filaments made by Mariprofundus ferrooxydans, a modern-day bacterium found in iron-rich deep sea environments, in particular hydrothermal vents. “But ours are much bigger, much thicker,” he said. “I think what we are seeing is a microbial community – that they were working in concert and as the filaments grew from groups of these cells, they got intermingled and made a bigger, thicker haematite filament. The team also identified mineralised chemical byproducts in the rock, consistent with these ancient microbes living off iron, sulphur and possibly also carbon dioxide and light through a form of oxygen-free photosynthesis. Taken together, these new findings could suggest that a variety of microbial life may have existed as little as 300m years after Earth formed. “I believe it makes sense that they are just as old as the volcanic rocks that embed them, which would be 4.28bn years,” Papineau said. “Pushing the clock back is very important, because it tells us that it takes a very short time for life to emerge on a planetary surface. Very quickly after [Earth formed] there was microbial life taking place, eating iron and sulphur in these hydrothermal vents.” However, not everyone is convinced that the structures are biological in origin. While they bear some resemblance to other ancient and modern examples of bacteria, “these comparisons are in rocks or environments that have not been subjected to the very high degree of metamorphism [a process involving extreme temperature and pressure] of the Nuvvuagittuq rock”, said Prof Frances Westall, an expert on ancient fossil bacteria at the French National Centre for Scientific Research. She said: “I am particularly concerned about the parallelism of the filaments – it looks as if they are following the crystal lattices of the host mineral. This is not a microbial feature, so the filaments could be a metamorphic artefact.” On the other hand, the sulphur signature the team identified may have a biological origin. Westall said: “If their sulphur isotope data are correct, then it is possible that the chemical sediments represented by the Nuvvuagittuq jasperite did host traces of life associated with hydrothermal vents.”",News/Science,Microfossils may be evidence life began ‘very quickly’ after Earth formed,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/13/microfossils-may-be-evidence-life-began-very-quickly-after-earth-formed
4/14/2022,"Myanmar jailed more writers and public intellectuals in crackdowns last year than any other country, according to a freedom of expression advocacy group. PEN America’s annual census of detained writers, the Freedom to Write Index, found Myanmar’s junta detained at least 26 writers in 2021 as it sought to suppress opposition after seizing power from the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. According to PEN’s study, in total, Myanmar detains the third-highest number of writers and public intellectuals globally (26), behind only Saudi Arabia (29) and China (85). Many of those held in Saudi Arabia and China are serving long-term sentences and had been arrested in previous years. Across the world, at least 277 writers in 36 countries were jailed last year in connection with their writing or for exercising free expression, PEN said. Karin Deutsch Karlekar, the director of PEN America’s “free expression at risk” programmes, described the figures as intolerably high. “In Myanmar and in countries across the globe, writers and public intellectuals are being imprisoned for the ‘crime’ of exercising their freedom of expression and, in many cases, for using the power of the written word to fight back against authoritarianism,” she said. After the coup in Myanmar in February 2021, many poets and authors used their writing to express outrage and grief at military atrocities and inspire dissent. Of the 26 detained in Myanmar in 2021, the majority are held in prisons but have not yet been charged, according to PEN. Many have continued to write while in hiding or temporary exile, sharing work on Facebook or private apps where they feel it is safe to do so, said Karlekar. Others have been forced to self-censor due to the security risks. Reports of mistreatment and torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities are widespread. The writers represent only a fraction of those imprisoned by Myanmar’s junta, which has arrested those suspected of opposing its rule – from student protesters to teachers and doctors who have refused to work in junta-controlled facilities. More than 10,183 people are in detention, according to estimates by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners Burma, an advocacy group that tracks arrests and killings. The Freedom to Write Index is based on PEN’s internal research as well as news reports, data from other rights groups and information provided by the relatives of people who are detained. The index includes any instance where a writer was targeted because of their work, and jailed for more than 48 hours during 2021. PEN’s report raised particular concern about the oppression of writers in Iran, where 21 people were imprisoned, and pointed to a deteriorating situation in Belarus, where many writers were arrested during crackdowns in 2020 and 10 were detained last year. One in five of those detained globally were serving sentences of 10 or more years in prison, it said. Four writers and academics who were recorded in PEN’s 2021 Index died in custody. This includes the Iranian poet and film-maker Baktash Abtin who died of Covid in January 2022.",News/World news,"Myanmar jailed more writers in 2021 than any other country, says rights group",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/myanmar-jailed-more-writers-in-2021-than-any-other-country-says-rights-group
4/14/2022,"Vegan diets are healthier and safer for dogs than conventional meat-based diets, according to the largest study to date, as long as they are nutritionally complete. The diet and health of more than 2,500 dogs were followed over a year using surveys completed by their owners. These assessed seven general indicators of health, such as multiple visits to the vets, and 22 common illnesses. The researchers found that, for example, almost half the dogs fed conventional meat-based diets required non-routine medication but only a third of the dogs fed vegan diets did so. A separate study in 2021 found that dogs found vegan diets just as tasty as regular dog food. Some of the dogs in the study were fed raw meat diets and these were marginally more healthy than the vegan dogs overall. However, this may have been because they were on average a year younger. The damaging impact of western societies’ overconsumption of meat on the environment and people’s health has become clear in recent years, as well as rising concerns over how farm animals are treated. There are about 470m pet dogs in the world and an increasing number of pet owners are now considering changing their animal’s diets as well. About $9bn (£6.9bn) of vegan pet food was sold worldwide in 2020 and the sector is growing fast. “Our study is by far the largest study published to date,” said Prof Andrew Knight, at the University of Winchester, UK, and who led the study. “It revealed that the healthiest and least hazardous dietary choices for dogs are nutritionally sound vegan diets.” “The raw meat diet appeared to have marginally better health outcomes,” he said. “But those dogs were significantly younger, which gives them a health advantage. A substantial body of prior studies have also shown that raw meat diets are much more contaminated with pathogenic bacteria and parasites.” The study, published in the journal Plos One, analysed surveys completed by 2,536 dog owners about a single animal. Just over half ate conventional meat-based diets, a third were fed raw meat and 13% had vegan diets. Among the findings were that 17% of dogs on conventional diets had four or more visits to the vet over the course of a year, compared with 9% for those on vegan diets and 8% for those on raw meat diets. The percentage of dogs reported to have suffered from health disorders was 49% for the conventional diet, 43% for the raw meat diet and 36% for the vegan diet. Survey-based studies cannot reveal the reasons for their results but Knight suggested weight problems might be an important factor: “One of the most common health problems for dogs is being overweight or obese and it is unfortunately common that when we do tests on the commercial meat-based diets, there are more calories.” “We also know the health hazards associated with overconsumption of meat and dairy for people and it’s often the same ingredients,” he said, although in some countries pet food can contain meat deemed not fit for human consumption. Further research is needed to confirm the findings. “The key limitation of our study is that we didn’t have a population of animals locked up in a research facility and fed one specific diet without any alteration,” Knight said. “We studied what real dogs in normal homes ate and their health outcomes. It gives us a good indication as to what the outcomes are for dogs in the real world.” Justine Shotton, the president of the British Veterinary Association, said: “There is a lot of ongoing research in the field of vegan dog diets and this paper adds to the body of evidence supporting its benefits. However, there is currently a lack of robust data mapping the health consequences of feeding a vegan diet to a large number of dogs over many years, so we look forward to seeing further research on whether this can meet a dog’s dietary requirements over the long term.” “Although we would not recommend it, it is theoretically possible to feed a dog a vegetarian diet, but owners would need to take expert veterinary advice to avoid dietary deficiencies and associated disease,” she said. Most of the respondents to the survey were in the UK and other European countries and more than 90% were women, but Knight said this was unlikely to have caused a systematic bias. Knight, who follows a vegan diet himself but does not own a dog, devised and led the peer-reviewed study, which was funded by the charity ProVeg.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Vegan diets are healthier and safer for dogs, study suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/13/vegan-diets-are-healthier-and-safer-for-dogs-study-suggests
4/14/2022,"Five thousand nurses at Stanford and Lucile Packard children’s hospital in Stanford, California, are preparing to strike in demand of wage increases, mental health and wellness support, better healthcare benefits, and a focus on hiring and retaining nurse staff. The union has set a strike date for 25 April. Stanford hospital at Stanford University in California has been consistently ranked among the top hospitals in the US by US News, but nurses say high turnover rates, understaffing, and inadequate benefits and proposed wage increases have contributed to high burnout rates. In a survey of union members, 45% of nurses reporting said they intend to leave their job within the next five years. Kathy Stormberg, a nurse in the radiology department at Stanford hospital for 19 years and vice-president of the Committee for Recognition of Nursing Achievement (Crona), blamed the strike on the hospitals’ continued reliance on contractors and its policy of pushing nurses to work overtime amid staff shortages, unfilled vacancies, and difficulties retaining enough nursing staff. “That is not sustainable,” said Stormberg. “Nurses have an overwhelming sense of guilt to work overtime when they are getting texts requesting nurses to come in every four hours on their days off.” She also cited inflation, the high cost of living in the Bay area, student debt, and other area hospitals providing better wages and benefits as obstacles for nurses to sustain careers at Stanford. Nurses represented by the union voted by 93% in favor of a strike authorization as the union’s contract expired on 31 March and 30 bargaining sessions over the past three months have yet to yield a tentative agreement. The union has criticized the lack of participation from nursing administrators in bargaining sessions. This would be the first time they’ve gone on strike since 2000. Leading up to the strike vote, nurses have held rallies outside the hospitals to demand a new contract. The union must give a 10-day notice before walking out. Kelli McNulty, a nurse at Stanford hospital, said that due to the inadequate health insurance benefits provided to nurses, she had to get a job at a local Amazon for a week working night shifts and then sign up for Cobra insurance in order to obtain health insurance coverage that covered fertility services. She had a hysterectomy at age 27 and has been trying to get pregnant through in vitro fertilization, but the health insurance coverage offered to nurses with the union doesn’t cover it. “It’s mind boggling to me that we’re one of the most well known institutions in the world and they don’t even give us IVF insurance or reproductive benefits,” said McNulty. “I was a little shell shocked by the fact that I worked full-time at Stanford and then I had to go live in an Econo Lodge hotel to work overnight for a week at Amazon just to get benefits.” In January 2022, a nurse on a contract at Stanford hospital walked out of their shift and killed themself, highlighting the need for better mental health and wellness support services and for improvements to the poor working conditions that nurse have faced through the Covid-19 pandemic. “The working conditions that we have now are just no longer sustainable,” said Leah McFadden, a nurse in Stanford’s surgical trauma unit since October 2019. “Over the last two years, we’re starting to run on empty, we aren’t having a chance to decompress, or even just get away from the hospital as much as we should.” McFadden said she pays out of pocket to see a therapist to help her manage the stress of working in nursing during the pandemic. Her unit took care of Covid patients for the first 15 months of the pandemic, and has since reverted to surgical trauma, but patients’ acuity has been intense given the delays in medical care many Americans faced due to pandemic restrictions and hospitals being overwhelmed with Covid patients. “Nurses are burnt out and tired, and nurses are not only leaving the bedside nationwide, but don’t necessarily want to live in this area because of how expensive it is,” said McFadden. “We want the hospital to recognize that they’re going to need to make some drastic changes in order to keep the nursing force that they’re so proud of.” In a joint statement, a spokesperson for Stanford hospital and the Lucile Packard children’s hospital said in an email: “At Stanford Health Care and Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital, we believe that hard work at the negotiations table is a far better path than a strike to achieving new contracts for our nurses. We are committed, through good faith bargaining, to reach agreement on new contracts that provide nurses a highly competitive compensation package, along with proposals that further our commitment to enhancing staffing and wellness benefits for nurses. Now, as we take the necessary and precautionary steps to prepare for the possibility of a strike, we hope that CRONA chooses to instead focus its efforts on working with us toward contract agreements.”  In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is at 800-273-8255 and online chat is also available.

4/14/2022,"Ministers and London’s mayor have delivered a withering assessment of the state of the Metropolitan police in a job advert for a new commissioner to urgently root out the wrongdoing that has been sapping public confidence. The advert seeks candidates to replace Cressida Dick, who quit in February after the mayor, Sadiq Khan, lost faith in her ability to drag the force out of a series of scandals, with the Home Office declining to save her. The focus in the job advert to become Britain’s top police officer in 2017, when Dick won the post, was on fighting crime. While there is still a focus on this in the new advert, it also calls for a transformation and inspirational leadership and stresses the need to tackle the problems blighting Britain’s biggest force. The advert says: “It has become evident that significant and sustained improvements need to be made within the [Met] to restore public confidence and legitimacy in the largest police force in the UK.” Candidates will have to have “an achievable plan to restore the trust and confidence of Londoners”, the advert says. It calls for “empowering leadership to address concerns around police conduct and tackling institutional culture”, adding that the successful candidate must re-establish public trust and confidence “particularly [among] women and girls and those from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities”. The job will involve addressing “serious failings” in the force, the advert says. A separate recruitment information document for the £293,000-a-year post says: “This will include delivering a police force that better reflects the diversity of London, and implementing a strong ethical framework of behaviour for the [Met], rooting out unacceptable behaviour at all levels, including misogyny, racism and homophobia.” Scandals on race, homophobia and police treatment of women have plagued the Met, but it was the leadership’s handling and response to them that alarmed government and City Hall, as well as a perceived defensiveness by Dick. The next commissioner will ultimately be picked by the home secretary, who has to take into account the views of Khan, who is also the police and crime commissioner for London. One potential candidate to be Met commissioner said the enthusiastic ceremonies arranged by officers to mark Dick’s departure made it appear they thought the last five years had gone well, adding: “The Met don’t think they have done anything wrong.” Potential candidates include the former head of counter-terrorism Sir Mark Rowley, who left policing four years ago, after which he co-authored a novel. Lynne Owens, who stood down as director general of the National Crime Agency to fight cancer, is also considering applying after positive medical news. If Matt Jukes, the Met’s current head of counter-terrorism, applies, he would be a candidate representing a new generation of police leaders. The chief constable of Devon and Cornwall, Shaun Sawyer, may also apply and is said to have impressed the Home Office in his national role as lead on performance. Among the big hitters unlikely to apply are Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council; Dave Thompson, the well-regarded chief constable of the West Midlands; Simon Byrne, of the Police Service of Northern Ireland; and Neil Basu, once viewed as Dick’s heir apparent but seen by government as not pliable enough. Basu is understood to have done very well in his interview to be the next head of the National Crime Agency. The announcement for that post has been delayed.

4/14/2022,"Between 2014 and 2018, the 25 wealthiest Americans collectively earned $401bn, but paid just $13.6bn – about 3.4% of that – in taxes, according to a bombshell ProPublica investigation into the finances of the wealthiest Americans released on Wednesday. The investigation is the latest in a series ProPublica started in June 2021 that looks at the tax records of the top 0.001% wealthiest Americans. This installment uses a trove of tax filings from 2013 to 2018 to dive into the wealth of the 400 richest Americans, all of whom earn more than $110m a year. It found that the wealthy benefit from lower tax rates on financial assets and deductions from charitable contributions to keep their taxes low. The difference in tax rates between the wealthiest Americans and the average worker comes down to two critical factors, according to the investigation: first, the wealthy have their income taxed at a lower rate because much of their wealth is accumulated through investments, like stocks; and second, the wealthy are able to use large charitable donations to get huge deductions. Instead of the standard paycheck that most American workers get, which includes deductions for social security and Medicare taxes, the wealthiest Americans get their income through financial assets, like stocks, that are generally taxed at a lower rate. The long-term capital gains rate has been 20% since 2013. Billionaires in tech pay the lowest tax rate, an average of 17% of their income, largely because their wealth comes from such investment income. Bill Gates, whose income from 2013 to 2018 was an average of $2.85bn a year, paid an average effective federal income tax rate of 18.4%. Lauren Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, earned an average of $1.57bn and paid an average tax rate of 14.8%. Ten of the top 15 earners on the list are billionaires who made their money in tech. In comparison, the average single worker earning $45,000 paid an average tax rate of 21%. A married couple with one child who earns $200,000 paid a rate of 26%. In 2018, the highest top rate on ordinary income, which excludes investments, was 37%, yet the average tax rate for the 400 wealthiest Americans was 22% from 2013 to 2018. Executives and founders of private equity companies, of which there are 43 on the list, can get taxed at a lower rate through a loophole that allows them to report fees from managing clients’ money as an investment income, which is taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Along with getting taxed at a lower rate through having an investment income, the wealthiest Americans can also write off huge chunks of their income by deducting large charitable donations. Michael Bloomberg, who earned an average of $2.05bn a year from 2013 to 2018, had 66% of his income deducted, giving him one of the lowest tax rates of the group – 4.1%. ProPublica noted that when reached for comments, no one named in the story disputed figures reported in the investigation, and few provided responses. One spokesperson for Ken Griffin, chief executive of hedge fund company Citadel, said that the IRS data “significantly understate[s]” what Griffin pays because the rate was lowered by charitable contributions and does not include local and state taxes. A spokesperson for Mark Zuckerberg said, “Mark has always paid the taxes he is required to pay”, while a spokesperson for Bloomberg similarly said that he “pays the minimum tax rate on all federal, state, local and international taxable income as prescribed by law”. The disparity between the sky-high incomes of the wealthiest Americans and their tax rates is something that has already caught the attention of lawmakers. Last month, Joe Biden proposed a new tax on households making more than $100m a year. The plan, called the “billionaire minimum income tax”, would impose a 20% minimum tax on an individual’s realized and unrealized income, which would cover investment income. “In 2021 alone, America’s more than 700 billionaires saw their wealth increase by $1tn, yet in a typical year, billionaires like these would pay just 8% of their total realized and unrealized income in taxes. A firefighter or teacher can pay double that tax rate,” the White House said in a statement detailing the plan. At the recent meeting of the Patriotic Millionaires, a group made up of individuals with high net worth who believe the wealthy should pay more taxes, a topic of conversation was the tidal shift over taxing the wealthy that seems to be happening. “No one was talking about the taxing the rich when we started,” said Morris Pearl, chair of the Patriotic Millionaires and a former managing director at BlackRock. “We have seen a huge change. You have a president talking about taxing the rich, people are talking about wealth taxes – those weren’t even fringe ideas 10 years ago. I’m not saying it’s going to happen and pass into law but there are conversations at the highest levels.”",News/US news,"Wealthiest Americans pay just 3.4% of income in taxes, investigation reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/13/wealthiest-americans-tax-income-propublica-investigation
4/14/2022,"Boris Johnson has been hit by the first ministerial resignation since he was fined by police for breaking Covid rules, as the justice minister, David Wolfson, said the prime minister’s actions were “inconsistent with the rule of law”. Lord Wolfson said it would be wrong for “that conduct to pass with constitutional impunity, especially when many in society complied with the rules at great personal cost, and others were fined or prosecuted for similar, and sometimes apparently more trivial, offences.” In a letter posted on Twitter, the Conservative peer added that he had “no option other than to tender my resignation”. My letter to the Prime Minister today. pic.twitter.com/lADCvKDKbB Wolfson’s resignation will reignite questions about Johnson’s leadership, coming hours after the Conservative MP Nigel Mills said publicly that he would submit a letter of no confidence in the prime minister. The fallout after Johnson, his wife, Carrie, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, were issued with fixed-penalty notices as part of Scotland Yard’s Partygate investigation has been somewhat muted, given the fines were handed out while many MPs are on holiday during recess. But despite some of Johnson’s allies’ attempts to play down the gathering that he was fined for attending by claiming he was only present for nine minutes for people to wish him happy birthday, Wolfson seemed clear that the event broke Covid rules. He wrote in a letter to Johnson on Wednesday afternoon: “Justice may often be a matter of courts and procedures, but the rule of law is something else – a constitutional principle which, at its root, means that everyone in a state, and indeed the state itself, is subject to the law. “It is not just a question of what happened in Downing Street, or your own conduct. It is also, and perhaps more so, the official response to what took place. As we obviously do not share that view of these matters, I must ask you to accept my resignation.” Wolfson said he was proud of helping the government with planned judicial reforms. But he added: “We can only undertake these and other legal reforms at home, and also credibly defend democratic norms abroad, especially at a time of war in Europe, if we are, and are seen to be, resolutely committed both to the observance of the law and also to the rule of law.” Wolfson is the second justice minister to quit under Johnson’s leadership, after the resignation of Lord Keen in September 2020 over the prime minister’s attempt to potentially break international law by overriding parts of the Brexit deal. Steve Reed, the shadow justice secretary, congratulated Wolfson “for taking a principled stand”. But he asked: “What does this mean for the lord chancellor, Dominic Raab, who’s constitutionally charged with upholding the law but is instead condoning law-breaking?” Johnson received and paid his £50 fine on Tuesday, and is said to be being investigated by the Met for attending up to six potentially law-breaking events. He faces the prospect of being issued with further fixed-penalty notices if officers decide other gatherings he was at – including the “bring your own booze” garden party to which more than 100 people were invited – are deemed to have breached Covid rules.",News/Politics,Justice minister resigns over No 10 Partygate revelations,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/13/justice-minister-david-wolfson-resigns-partygate-boris-johnson
4/14/2022,"The French far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has said that once the Russia-Ukraine war is over, she would propose closer links between Nato and Russia and pull France out of the military command of the US-led alliance. “As soon as the Russian-Ukrainian war is over and has been settled by a peace treaty, I will call for the implementation of a strategic rapprochement between Nato and Russia,” she said at a press conference. Le Pen, who is polling at 45% to Emmanuel Macron’s 55% for the presidential runoff vote on 24 April, called the press conference on foreign policy to try to take the spotlight off her previous close relationship with Vladimir Putin, which has led to claims from Macron that she was “complacent” and “financially dependent” on the Kremlin. Le Pen said any talk of her betraying French interests or being indebted to Putin was “inaccurate and particularly unjust”. As she spoke, a protester stood up holding a heart-shaped picture of Le Pen and Putin shaking hands at the Kremlin in 2017. The protester was tackled to the ground by security guards and dragged out along the floor. In 2014, Le Pen’s party – then called the Front National, and since renamed National Rally – borrowed €9m from a Russian-Czech bank for local election campaigns. It is still paying off the loan. Five years ago when Le Pen also faced Macron in the 2017 runoff, which she lost heavily, Putin hosted her at the Kremlin, posing for a handshake. At the time, Le Pen declared admiringly that she shared the same values as Putin and that a “new world order” was emerging with Putin, Donald Trump and her at the helm. She has changed tack on Russia since the outbreak of war, condemning the invasion of Ukraine and saying she is independent of any foreign nation, and she has tried to shift attention on to the domestic price of sanctions, inflation, energy costs and the cost of living crisis. At the press conference she said: “I only ever defended the interests of France.” She said her approach was very similar to Macron’s, since he had built up a personal relationship with Putin and pursued dialogue with him, inviting him to the Palace of Versailles and to his summer residence on the Mediterranean. Le Pen said better ties with Russia would prevent Moscow from becoming too close to China, noting that she was echoing an argument made by Macron in the past. On defence, Le Pen said: “I would place our troops neither under an integrated Nato command nor under a future European command,” adding that she would refuse any “subjection to an American protectorate”. In the final weeks before what is expected to be a close vote, the pro-Europe Macron has savaged Le Pen on foreign policy grounds, attacking her for nationalism and friendships with rightwing leaders. He told a rally in Strasbourg this week that “nationalism is war”. Le Pen has changed her policy on Europe from five years ago when she pushed for France to leave the EU and the euro. But Macron has said her proposed changes to treaties, dismantling of rules and cuts to budget contributions would mean France was pushed out of the EU. “She wants to leave but she doesn’t dare say it,” Macron said, accusing his opponent of wanting to strike a special alliance with the right in Hungary and Poland. Le Pen took a loan from a Hungarian bank for the campaign, and told the press conference that French banks had refused to lend to her. Le Pen said she did not want “Frexit” but a looser version of the EU. “Nobody is against Europe,” she said. “I would not stop paying France’s contribution to the EU, I want to diminish it.” But she said the UK’s Brexit had been a big success. She said the French “ruling political class” had been proved wrong after it predicted a “cataclysm for the English”. She said: “The British got rid of the Brussels bureaucracy, which they could never bear, to move to an ambitious project of global Britain.” But she added: “This is not our project. We want to reform the EU from the inside.” Le Pen insisted she wanted to keep a close relationship with Germany, but then launched a stinging attack on their strategic differences, which she said would mean putting an end to a series of Franco-German joint military programmes. She said she would continue “reconciliation” with Germany, “without following the Macron-Merkel model of French blindness towards Berlin”.",News/World news,Marine Le Pen proposes closer Nato-Russia ties after Ukraine war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/marine-le-pen-proposes-closer-nato-russia-ties-after-ukraine-war
4/14/2022,"Rich countries need to provide emergency food supplies to prevent rising prices and shortages triggering social unrest in poorer parts of the world, the heads of four major international bodies have said. Calling for urgent and coordinated action, the World Bank, the UN World Food Programme, the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund warned that the food crisis was pushing millions of people into poverty. “The threat is highest for the poorest countries with a large share of consumption from food imports, but vulnerability is increasing rapidly in middle-income countries, which host the majority of the world’s poor,” the joint statement from World Bank president, David Malpass, WFP executive director David Beasley, WTO director general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said. The World Bank has estimated that for each one percentage point increase in food prices, 10 million people are thrown into extreme poverty worldwide, while Okonjo-Iweala warned last month that hunger raised the risk of food riots. “The increase in food prices and supply shocks can fuel social tensions in many of the affected countries, especially those that are already fragile or affected by conflict,” the statement said. Issued before next week’s spring meetings of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington, the statement by the leaders of the four global institutions said the world was being hit by compounding crises – including Covid-19, the war in Ukraine and sharply rising costs of staple foods. They called on the international community to support vulnerable countries through coordinated actions including emergency food supplies, financial support, increased agricultural production and open trade. “We also urge the international community to help support urgent financing needs, including through grants. This should include financing of immediate food supplies, safety nets to address the needs of the poor, and for small farmers facing higher input prices. “We also urge all countries to keep trade open and avoid restrictive measures such as export bans on food or fertiliser that further exacerbate the suffering of the most vulnerable people. It is especially important not to impose export restrictions on humanitarian food purchases by the UN’s World Food Programme.”",News/Inequality,"Poorer countries need urgent food help to stop disorder, say global bodies",https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2022/apr/13/poorer-countries-need-urgent-food-help-to-stop-disorder-say-global-bodies
4/14/2022,"After almost losing control of his parliamentary party over the Partygate scandal, Boris Johnson created a Westminster operation designed to perform serious damage limitation, which leapt into action when it was revealed he broke lockdown law. This is how it works: Every cabinet needs a media attack job and that role has fallen to the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, who did the broadcast round the morning after the prime minister’s fine was revealed. Shapps has been prepared to let his differences with the PM be known in the past – including over onshore wind and Covid-19 lockdowns – but he remains the cabinet’s best media performer when Johnson is in a tight spot. Johnson has other key loyalists who will go out to bat without any undue pressure, including the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, whom MPs have described as being “aggressively partisan” on internal WhatsApp groups, as well as Jacob Rees-Mogg, whose dismissal of Partygate as a non-issue has sometimes perhaps gone further even than No 10’s own spinners. Johnson has plenty of disillusioned ex-ministers who are among his staunchest critics, both publicly and privately, but there are a key group of those either hoping to advance from junior roles or hoping to be brought back from the wilderness who have been demonstrably loyal at the most awkward of opportunities. Among the most prominent is ex-health secretary Matt Hancock, forced to resign himself for an embarrassing lockdown breach, but who has remained steadfastly loyal from the backbenches including defending the prime minister’s breaches that were arguably more serious than the kiss that cost him his own career. Robert Jenrick, the reshuffled ex-communities secretary, has also been out defending Johnson on the airwaves. Having cleared out the whips’ office in a bid to restore discipline, the new chief, Chris Heaton-Harris, and his deputy, Chris Pincher, have been said by some to have taken on a “good cop, bad cop” approach to stop MPs rebelling in votes and voicing their discontent with the government publicly in the media. The pair organised a team dinner last month for all Conservative MPs to get together and restore some of the bonds of camaraderie that had become severely frayed during Johnson’s lowest point in mid-January. While both have avoided making any public appearances, they play an important backroom role: reassuring MPs who are sceptical of key government decisions, and if needed, dangling the prospect of promotion to encourage them to stay supportive. If Johnson’s long-term survival is to be guaranteed, he will need to rely on the support of the whips’ office to flag early concerns when they believe there is widespread unhappiness within the party on a particular issue, for instance to avoid a repeat of the Owen Paterson affair. Working more quietly round the edges of the backbenches, Johnson can count on a number of key allies to be his eyes and ears in places that the whips’ office do not naturally extend. Among them are his parliamentary private secretaries – the former minister James Duddridge, who was one of the first Tory MPs to submit a no-confidence letter in Theresa May, and two of the 2019 intake, Joy Morrissey and Lia Nici. Johnson’s longtime friend Conor Burns, a Northern Ireland minister, and Nigel Adams, who is a minister without portfolio but attends cabinet, are also still working to secure his safety – having both been heavily involved in the “shadow whipping operation” to get MPs to withdraw no-confidence letters at the height of the Partygate scandal. Many new Tory MPs – particularly from “red wall” seats that had only previously voted Labour – feel they owe Johnson a great personal debt for helping secure their election to parliament. As such, they are effusive in their praise of him and keen to dismiss many of the criticisms levelled at the prime minister as minor issues of no great concern to the general public – including the police fines for Downing Street parties. Among Johnson’s most fervent red wall supporters are Mark Jenkinson, the Workington MP who dismissed criticism of Johnson attending a birthday party as “the left” wanting to “bring down a democratically elected government over a birthday cake widely reported at the time”. Another red waller, former teacher Brendan Clarke-Smith, accused Labour of “incredible hypocrisy” because of past occasions when the opposition party’s MPs were fined for speeding or using a phone while driving. And Katherine Fletcher recently attempted to come to Johnson’s defence in the Commons recently, saying constituents had told her: “He’s a wally but 100,000 Russians have just turned up. What the bloody hell are we doing talking about cake?”",News/Politics,How Boris Johnson’s damage-limitation operation works ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/13/how-boris-johnsons-damage-limitation-operation-works
4/14/2022,"Rebekah Vardy is unable to disclose potentially crucial WhatsApp messages in the ongoing “Wagatha Christie” legal case because an IT expert has “forgotten the password” to the data. Vardy is suing fellow footballer’s wife Coleen Rooney for libel after Rooney publicly alleged that Vardy leaked private information to the Sun. The wife of Leicester City’s Jamie Vardy strongly denies the claims made by the partner of the Derby County manager, Wayne Rooney. Lawyers acting for Rooney want to force Vardy to disclose conversations with her agent, Caroline Watt, who they allege acted as a “conduit” who funnelled stories to journalists at the Sun. However, Rooney’s team said they have been frustrated by “a series of unfortunate events” while trying to access the messages. Barrister David Sherborne, acting for Rooney, told the high court that Vardy had employed an external technology expert to help back up her mobile phone messages as part of the legal proceedings. Unfortunately, the IT expert tasked with securing the material has since “forgotten the password which he used to encrypt the material”. Sherborne said this meant the messages could not be disclosed to Rooney’s lawyers ahead of a trial, leaving the legal team struggling to make their case. Sara Mansoori QC, acting for Vardy, confirmed to the court there had been a “corruption issue” with the password required to access the data that had been on Vardy’s phone. It is the latest data-retrieval issue to affect the long-running legal case. A previous high court hearing heard how Watt accidentally dropped her mobile phone off the side of a boat in the North Sea after Rooney’s lawyers requested to search it. Rooney was dubbed “Wagatha Christie” after running an elaborate sting operation where she put fake updates on a private Instagram account and waited to see if they ended up as news stories. The long-running legal case will revolve on whether Rooney can prove that Vardy was leaking information to the Sun. A key part of Rooney’s case is that Watt acted as a “conduit” for such stories, although her legal team recently failed in an attempt to formally add the agent to the legal proceedings. On Wednesday the court heard that Watt is “in a fragile state and had been expressing serious concerns about giving evidence”. Hugh Tomlinson QC, acting for Vardy, said a consultant forensic psychiatrist had produced a report that concluded the agent was not fit to provide oral evidence at the high court trial. Rooney’s lawyers insisted Watt was a “key witness” for the trial with “critical” evidence: “Ms Watt is now saying that she is too ill to attend court to be cross-examined on the events and allegations concerning her, although she was and is able to provide a lengthy witness statement about them, provided she is not questioned about it.” They alleged the real reason Watt was reluctant to take the stand and give evidence was not her psychological state but that she has realised “her evidence is untrue and therefore she is scared of being tested upon it”. Rooney achieved a partial victory on Wednesday after a judge ordered the owner of the Sun newspaper to disclose communications between Vardy, Watt and the Sun journalist Andy Halls to the legal teams. The judge said Halls was the author of one of the “so-called sting articles” featuring in the libel dispute and concluded that disclosure in relation to the journalist was “necessary” and “proportionate”. She said she was “not persuaded” that legal tests were met to allow disclosure in relation to a further eight journalists at the Sun. The case has already cost millions of pounds in legal fees but neither Rooney nor Vardy has been willing to settle, despite judges imploring them to reach a mediated outcome. Unless there is a last-minute change of heart by either side, the libel case is due to go to trial at the high court next month.",News/UK news,Rebekah Vardy’s IT expert ‘loses password’ to ‘Wagatha Christie’ WhatsApp messages,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/13/rebekah-vardys-it-expert-loses-password-to-wagatha-christie-whatsapp-messages
4/14/2022,"Plans to accelerate the closure of Australia’s biggest coal-fired plant have the potential to create electricity shortages in three states unless enhancements to the grid proceed and new generation and storage capacity is added, the market operator said. The shortfall assessment is contained in an updated electricity statement of opportunities (Esoo) report. It was prompted by Origin Energy’s February decision to bring forward closure of its 2,880-megawatt Eraring plant in New South Wales by seven years, to 2025. The Australian energy market operator (Aemo) said that taking into account only existing and committed developments: NSW (where possible shortfall has been advanced by four years) faced a reliability gap of 590MW capacity from 2025-26. Victoria faced a gap of 330MW from 2028-29. Queensland faced a gap of 770MW from 2029-30. “The retirement of Eraring power station, without replacement investments, could lead to a reduction in the reliability of the national electricity market (Nem), particularly in NSW,” said Merryn York, Aemo’s executive general manager for system design. On the face of it, the pipeline of new energy projects is huge – with 138 gigawatts in potential projects, or more than double the existing large-scale capacity of just under 60GW. Since the annual Esoo report in August, NSW alone added a net 1GW of new capacity, and Queensland 417MW. York said if these anticipated investments and “projects in the [integrated system plan] and NSW government’s energy roadmap” went ahead according to schedule, “forecast reliability outcomes in the Nem would meet or exceed the reliability standard in 2025-26”. Australia’s electricity industry is fastest decarbonising sector of the economy, with almost of one-third of power supplied by zero-emissions renewable energy. Regulators, however, have to prepare for the ongoing influx of low-cost solar and wind energy, which is pushing out coal and gas-fired plants faster than companies had planned. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Federal energy minister Angus Taylor last week proposed requiring generators to give five years’ minimum notice before closing power stations. But that suggestion, up from three-and-a-half years, gained little traction – not least because it would be difficult to enforce if a company had a major plant failure or went broke. Aemo’s alert comes ahead of the release of its quarterly energy dynamics report at the end of April, which is likely to show electricity prices continuing to rise. In January, the operator said wholesale prices were rising because of higher costs for gas and coal. Independent market watchers are also showing recent, sharp rises in power prices. The Morrison government has talked up the fall in electricity prices as an achievement, including in the recent budget...but things are turning, particularly in NSW. (Credit: Energy Action, and its tracking of what corporate customers are paying). #AusVotes2022 #ausvotes #auspol pic.twitter.com/P8gZ4a8osD Unlike steeper petrol prices, the prospect of larger power bills has so far had little attention in the run-up to the federal election. In last month’s budget, the Morrison government touted its success in “delivering on its commitment to a secure, affordable, and reliable energy supply and [achieving] its goal of wholesale electricity prices under $70/MW-hour.” On Wednesday, however, spot prices were $300/MWh or higher in all four mainland states in the Nem. NSW plant closures include the Vales Point power station, scheduled to shut in 2029-30. Victoria’s potential crunch comes with the 2028-29 closure of the Yallourn power plant in the Latrobe Valley. And Queensland’s possible shortfall is related to reduced availability of supplies from NSW, Aemo said. But the risk of generation gaps should decrease: NSW alone is anticipated to have another 1.7GW of large-scale wind and solar farms and new grids links operating by 2025. “NSW’s reliability will further improve following the completion of the Sydney Ring [July 2027] and HumeLink [2026] transmission projects,” York said. “[This will allow] more southern NSW generation capacity, such as Snowy 2.0, to reach Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong during times of supply scarcity.” A clutch of new batteries, including the “Waratah super battery” with 1.4GW-hours of storage proposed by Origin, should also provide support for the grid by the time Eraring closes.",News/Australia news,Early closure of Australia’s largest coal-fired plant could create electricity shortages without grid upgrades,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/14/early-closure-of-australias-largest-coal-fired-plant-could-create-electricity-shortages-without-grid-upgrades
4/14/2022,"The Liberal party candidate in Warringah, Katherine Deves, described Wear it Purple Day – a day billed as celebrating diversity – as a “grooming tactic” promoting “extreme body modification” on a now-deleted website. On the now-deleted website, seen by Guardian Australia, she also suggested a young boy could ask to “remove his penis” after attending a respectful relationships workshop at school. These comments follow news on Wednesday that Deves had also deleted social media accounts on which she described trans children as “surgically mutilated and sterilised”. Deves, who Scott Morrison lauded as standing up for “common sense” when asked to comment on her advocacy for banning trans women from competing in women’s sport this week, was handpicked to run in Warringah despite joining the Liberal party a few months before the election. While Deves’ campaign bio labels her as a “women’s advocate”, posts from her now-deleted website reveals a series of inflammatory posts about trans people, including one article in which she repeatedly misgenders New Zealand trans weightlifter Laurel Hubbard. The posts, published last year, also criticise the New South Wales police for taking part in Wear it Purple Day, a decade-old advocacy event aiming to reduce bullying and youth suicide by celebrating “diversity and inclusion” raising “awareness about sexuality, sex and gender identity” and challenging “harmful social cultures”. The event has been adopted by police in both NSW and Queensland who wear purple uniforms. In 2019, NSW police said officers taking part in the event were “spreading the simple message that ‘you have the right to be proud of who you are’.” “Regardless of their gender or sexuality, young people need to understand they are not alone, and our police officers will be out in the community to not only reinforce that, but to show they can come to us for help,” assistant commissioner Tony Crandell said at the time. But in the post, Deves accused participants of “endorsing extreme body modification and irreversible hormone treatments for vulnerable children”. She claimed the event is a “grooming tactic” used by “gender extremists” to “enforce upon society the false idea that biological sex is irrelevant”. “They want to capture children and adolescents as profit centres by promoting hormonal and surgical gender transition as a solution for emotional distress and social awkwardness, and remove basic safeguarding for children and women,” she stated in the post. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She criticised police taking part in the event for “demonstrating their allegiance to this contentious and controversial ideology”. Deves was handpicked to run in Tony Abbott’s seat after the federal intervention of the NSW Liberal party. She only joined the party in 2021, and sources told the Guardian she was a “captain’s pick” who had not been a frontrunner before the takeover. On Wednesday News.com.au reported that Deves had also deleted social media accounts on which she described trans children as “surgically mutilated and sterilised” and said she was “triggered” by the LGBT rainbow flag. According to the report, one of the deleted posts included the words “they will not stand for seeing vulnerable children surgically mutilated and sterilised” alongside a photo of a teenager who had undergone top surgery. In another she reportedly said, in reference to the rainbow flag, “I get triggered by it”. “Whenever I see it on social media I think ‘What now? What are they demanding now?’ And I grew up with gay relatives and siblings and hung out in Surry Hills and X in Sydney in the 1990s. Lots of LGB family and friends, their movement has been destroyed.” After the posts were revealed, the peak body representing LGBTIQ+ people, Equality Australia, which labelled it “an example of the dehumanising abuse that trans people, and the broader LGBTIQ+ community, encounter every day”. Deves later apologised, saying her comments were “not acceptable”. “My advocacy for the rights and safety of women and girls is well known, and I stand by my desire to ensure we protect the safety of women and girls and our entire community,” she said in a statement. “However, the language I used was not acceptable, and for that I apologise.” But the articles written on her website – which has also been deleted – contain a series of inflammatory comments, including claims the gay and lesbian movement had been “hijacked by trans activists”. “You might be one of the unlucky parents whose son comes home from primary school and says he wants to remove his penis because he is ‘really a girl’ when he has been nothing but a typical little boy because they’ve had a ‘respectful relationships’ workshop at school,” she wrote in one post. Deves is the co-founder of the Save Women’s Sport organisation, which has pushed to ban trans women from female-only sports. Asked about her views on the campaign trail this week, Morrison said she had “raised very important issues” along with the Tasmanian senator Claire Chandler, who has moved a private member’s bill seeking to allow sporting groups to exclude transgender people from single-sex sports. “Katherine is, you know, an outstanding individual … and she’s standing up for things that she believes in, and I share her views on those topics,” Morrison said. After initially stating he would have “more to say” on whether the government would support Chandler’s bill, Morrison walked back those on Wednesday after anger from party moderates. “It is a private member’s bill. The government does not have any plans for that to be a government bill,” he said.

4/14/2022,"While most Muslims prepare to break their fast at sunset during Ramadan, not all will be able to relish the sweet release of their first meal of the day. For those in hospitality like Elzhe Pahir, chef and manager at Tarim Uyghur Handmade Noodles in Auburn, the day ratchets up as sunset approaches. “It’s hard but cooking for a restaurant is a pretty good thing to do during Ramadan,” he says, as he helps his kitchen prepare for the inevitable dinner rush. Ramadan is the holiest month of the year for Muslims, where they must fast between sunrise and sunset. In Sydney, iftaar (the evening meal with which Muslims end their fast) is at around 5.30pm this year. But prep work begins long before that. “We start preparing from 3pm; our food is not that easy to prepare as well,” Pahir says. “Everything needs to be done fresh. “It’s hard to cook while we fast. The hardest part is that I can’t taste anything. So sometimes, we might have too little salt and we can’t tell.” Tarim is a popular Uyghur spot in Auburn, known for its dumplings, handmade noodles and warm atmosphere. It’s an unpretentious shop, wedged between small grocers and opposite rumbling train tracks, but has fostered a strong connection with the local Muslim community. “During the day it’s pretty quiet, 85% of my customers are Muslim. At iftaar time, the front and back area are completely full, there is even a wait sometimes.” “It gets so busy, we need to break our fast in the kitchen here. We have to.” But while the iftaar rush shapes the day at Tarim, it isn’t the most important time for Turkish patisserie Gaziantep Sweets, down the road. Their rush comes hours after iftaar, once everyone has finished their meals, prayed their prayers, and is itching for something sweet. “Ramadan is like a rejuvenation for us,” owner and head chef, Zeki Atilgan, says as he pipes chocolate over baklava. “We wait all year for it. “It’s not particularly hard cooking while fasting, but it is tempting.” The smell of puffing filo and warm rosewater syrup snakes its way into the sidestreets around Gaziantep, which is located a short walk from Gallipoli Mosque, one of the biggest and most popular mosques in Sydney. Once the nightly prayers are complete, mosque-goers stream into the shop, looking for something to take home, or a quick bite. “We actually get a lot of traffic during the day,” Atilgan says. But at night “everything doubles, you can feel it”. “It helps the business dramatically.” A similar late-night rush occurs at Sneakies Kitchen in Homebush, where owner, Baris Kopuz, has extended opening hours to cater for midnight cravings. “We get a lot of the second round of iftaar,” Kopuz says. “A lot of people stick to their family traditions when they break their fast, but we always have a second feed. “Because we’re open late, we get the second round, people going for a snack or maybe something more.” Known for their “pizza-burger”, Sneakies is an international grab-bag of fast food, serving everything from burgers to pastas, loaded fries and wings. Kopuz describes his menu as “east meets west”. “Obviously both cultures are very strong to me. You know, like I’m a part of both. I was born and grew up in Australia, but my background is Turkish, so it’s a bit of a fusion. It represents me to a tee.” Drenched in neon red, Sneakies is a mostly outdoor setting, with a projector in the centre of the space showing whatever football match happens to be on.

4/14/2022,"Queues and delays at Australian airports are expected to be at their worst ahead of the Easter long weekend, but security providers have warned the chaos stemming from staff shortages will continue into the second half of the year. More than 82,000 people are expected to travel through Sydney airport’s domestic terminals on Thursday – the busiest day since March 2020 – while 350,000 will visit over the course of the long weekend. The travel peak comes as the airport struggles with security staffing that is 70% of pre-pandemic levels. Senior executives at Sydney airport have been ordered to leave their offices, along with retail and IT workers, to help manage departure queues as Covid infections, isolation orders and a structurally depleted workforce contribute to the issues plaguing airports across the country. Melbourne airport had more domestic passengers pass through its terminals on Wednesday than it did in March 2020 while Brisbane and Adelaide airports were expecting 50,000 and 25,000 domestic travellers respectively on Thursday. Sydney airport’s chief executive, Geoff Culbert, has apologised in advance to travellers affected by delays on Thursday. But he insisted his organisation was “pulling every lever available to us to get people on their way safely” including “deploying senior executives and staff into our terminals to manage queues and ensure people make their flights”. Delays are occurring not just at the security checkpoints in departure terminals. A shortage of baggage handlers has seen wait times for luggage to arrive on carousels balloon up to an hour after landing. Air transport service staff – including security personnel at airports – are now recognised as critical workers in New South Wales and Victoria, which means they are exempt from the requirement to isolate for seven days if they are a close contact of a case, provided they are symptom-free. However, Culbert warned staffing issues would persist for Sydney airport because the company it contracts to provide security services, Certis, had been struggling to restore its workforce to pre-Covid levels. Certis has been trying to recruit 100 new employees at the airport since December but has only hired 50, and they are still undergoing a two-month training accreditation course. Staff who joined in mid-February are only this week beginning to work at airport check-in gates. Certis said in a statement: “The onboarding of new screening staff requires them to undergo an extensive training program before being deemed qualified to carry out the work. As more staff join in the weeks and months ahead, we expect some of the security challenges to ease, but rebuilding the workforce will take time.” The Transport Workers’ Union and the United Workers Union – which between them represent airport security, baggage and other airline workers – blame poor work conditions in the sector for the shortages. The TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, said the current staffing shortages were “entirely predictable”. He blamed the Morrison government for failing to include the entire aviation workforce on jobkeeper – specifically employees that had been outsourced to international companies but continued to work locally. “Many of these international companies that are outsourced to, such as Dnata and SNP Security [a subsidiary], didn’t get jobkeeper. Unsupported workers left the sector entirely and now don’t want to come back to casual and low-paid jobs,,” Kaine said. The UWU property services coordinator, Damien Davie, said Certis – which is Singaporean – did not qualify for jobkeeper due to its structure. He said many of the 250 employees Certis made redundant during the pandemic had since found jobs in other industries, including warehouses, with comparatively better pay and conditions. “Sydney airport is an unattractive workplace for aviation security. If you were a decent employer, it should be pretty easy to ring up the people [who were] trained up but let go and say, we’re rehiring,” Davie said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On Wednesday, Sydney passengers who arrived more than two hours before their flight were told check-in would not open until two hours before their departure. Rather than standing in a queue, these frustrated travellers were left to sit on the floor, further contributing to congestion in the terminal. “We came out very early because we thought we were going to be queued up,” said Lez who was travelling home to Ballina with his wife. “We’ve already got tags on our bags but we were told we can’t check in our bags until 1.20pm.” Lez’s Jetstar flight was set to depart at 3.25pm and he and his wife had made sure to arrive well in advance after they saw queues on the news. Beverly, who was travelling home to Hobart, had a similar story. “I did believe that we had to be here early. But of course, then, check-in into the flight is still standard, you can’t check in until two hours before your flight,” she said. “It really could have been managed a little bit better.” One positive is that business is booming for some airport retailers. Azucar cafe has become a refuge for travellers waiting until they can check in. “It’s been absolutely crazy, it’s been packed from 6am every day for five days,” a barista said on Wednesday. “We have had to refill the fridge at least five or six times today.”",News/Australia news,Queues and delays at Australian airports to peak over Easter long weekend,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/14/queues-and-delays-at-australian-airports-to-peak-over-easter-long-weekend
4/14/2022,"Companies linked to the proponent of the massive Urannah Dam project in north Queensland have given more than $150,000 to the Liberal National party, including a donation made a week after the Morrison government promised to spend $483m on its construction. A member of the disbanded National Water Grid advisory body, Stuart Khan, last month wrote to colleagues saying that taxpayer funding to the Urannah project had been allocated for “brazenly political purposes” and before a detailed business case had been scrutinised. Guardian Australia can reveal that the detailed business case, released publicly in recent weeks, includes an economic analysis that shows a negative return on investment. Every dollar spent would generate about 95c in benefit by 2050, it says. As questions mount about the merit of the project, more detail has emerged about political connections between the proponent, Bowen River Utilities, a complex suite of associated companies, their employees, and the LNP. Guardian Australia has previously reported that the sole director of Bowen River Utilities, John Cotter Jr, is a former member of the LNP state executive committee. Queensland electoral commission data shows that separate companies owned by Cotter and his wife – Initiative Capital and Kinbombi Holdings – are among the largest fundraisers for the Liberal National party. Those companies have donated more than $140,000 to the LNP in recent years. The company made a “fundraising contribution” of $5,000 to the LNP on 24 March – seven days after the federal funding announcement. Guardian Australia does not suggest that announcement is linked to that donation or that the donation is in any way improper. Initiative Capital also donated about $23,000 to Labor. Bowen River Utilities employs the wife of federal MP Julian Simmonds, former lobbyist Madeline Simmonds, as its communications manager. Initiative Capital has previously been described as a private sector investor in the Urannah project, and Cotter has previously spoken about attempts to find additional dam investment in the US. Bowen River Utilities staff have previously listed their employer in online profiles as Initiative Capital. A spokesperson for Bowen River Utilities said Cotter “has made donations to both the ALP and the LNP, all of which have been publicly declared (with) the Electoral Commission Queensland and Australian Electoral Commission”. The detailed business case for Urannah estimates incremental costs of about $1.35bn and incremental economic benefits of $1.29bn over a 30-year period – meaning the long-term economic return on investment is about 95c for every dollar invested. Analysis of a preliminary business case, commissioned by the Mackay Conservation Group, put the potential benefit as low as 26c in the dollar. Richard Denniss, the chief economist of the Australia Institute, told the Guardian last week that funding projects with low or questionable return on investment was “not taking the job of managing Australia’s economy seriously”. In addition to concerns about the wisdom of spending taxpayer money on a project that won’t return a net economic benefit by 2050, the project faces significant other hurdles, including difficulty acquiring properties necessary to build the dam. Some landholders say they oppose the project and won’t sell their properties – a situation that would require compulsory acquisition. The detailed business case talks about the potential need to approach the Queensland office of the coordinator general about acquisition. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning However Guardian Australia understands that the coordinator general has told the Urannah Properties Association – an Indigenous group that holds the title for the lease of a key property, Urannah Station – that it would not support compulsory acquisition of the property by a private company. A significant group of Indigenous traditional owners, including some of the proponents of the controversial Collinsville coal-fired power station, are opposed to the dam project. A Bowen River Utilities spokesperson said the Urannah Dam “will transform the greater Whitsunday region and deliver thousands of jobs, water security, reliable renewable energy and enormous economic benefits for north Queensland taxpayers”. “That’s why it is backed by regional communities who have a real determination driving us to build this project. The dam also has bipartisan support from all three levels of government.” BRU said it had land access and option agreements in place with some landholders, and that it was “continuing conversations with stakeholders” The company expects to finalise a draft environmental impact statement in the coming weeks.",News/Australia news,"Companies linked to Urannah Dam project donate more than $150,000 to Liberal National party",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/14/companies-linked-to-urannah-dam-project-donate-more-than-150000-to-liberal-national-party
4/14/2022,"The UK is sliding into a social and economic crisis, the likes of which its people have not seen for decades. Household fuel bills are on course to top £2,400 by this autumn, while the price of a grocery shop is rocketing. Meanwhile, the economy is flatlining and the average employee’s pay keeps falling behind inflation, which hit 7% in March, the highest rate since 1992. No wonder that the charities and analysts that work on poverty and inequality are issuing such dire warnings. On one projection, one in three Britons – 23.5 million people – will be unable to afford the cost of living this year. The rest of the world is being buffeted by the same storms: Covid, followed by soaring prices for food and fuel, and then Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has led to another massive rise in the cost of basics. The difference is that most other countries do not have our wealth, or social security system, or infrastructure. So imagine the devastation felt elsewhere, in countries less wealthy, less stable and less powerful. In Somalia, the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) predicts, more than 6 million people will fall into “crisis, emergency, or catastrophic levels of hunger” within the next two months. Add in southern Ethiopia and Kenya, and the total facing “crisis or worse” jumps to 16 million. A terse, bureaucratic, economical phrase – “crisis or worse” – denotes unimaginable human trauma: selling all you have to feed your children, leaving your family home and wandering miles for sustenance. You need a lot of luck to survive such rigours. Now imagine this fate befalling families from Africa to Asia to Latin America, because that is what lies ahead. Oxfam projects that 260 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty this year alone – that is to say, living on $1.90 (roughly £1.50) a day or less. These are vast numbers that so far have gone largely ignored. To take a small example: at the start of this year, the FAO appealed for $138m in aid for farming families in Somalia; four months later, it is still nearly two-thirds short. Much of the rich world – its governments, households and businesses – is focused on helping Ukraine, but sadly it is only one among many countries in desperate need of help. Some basic things can be done, both in the UK and internationally. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, could immediately restore the billions that he has cut from the aid budget. Next week, finance ministers from around the globe will fly into Washington DC for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank. There, they could agree to make up the humanitarian aid needed in the Horn of Africa, Afghanistan and elsewhere. They could restructure the debt of poorer countries, cancelling those loans that are simply unpayable, and suspending interest payments on others. And they should increase the financial reserves or strategic drawing rights provided by the IMF, while stipulating that they must go to poorer countries without the usual conditions imposed by economists from Washington. It remains an outrage that the rich world hasn’t waived patents on Covid vaccines or supported poorer countries in manufacturing them. And it is high time that a wealth tax was introduced across countries, taking from those who prospered wildly during the pandemic, then spent their proceeds on space travel or shares in troubled social media firms. The cost of not doing at least some of the above will be high: in human lives, in geopolitical stability, in financial markets. This week, Sri Lanka warned that it would renege on its foreign debts, even as thousands of protesters took to the streets of Colombo to demand the overthrow of their president. More dominoes are bound to fall.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the cost of living crisis: a global emergency | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/13/the-guardian-view-on-the-cost-of-living-crisis-a-global-emergency
4/14/2022,"Later on Thursday the new unemployment rate will come out, and because of the focus on the number this week (and whether or not leaders know it), it will probably get more focus than normal. Alas, most likely the number itself will get the focus rather than any economic policy surrounding it – including the conditions of those who remain unemployed. One of the annoying things about the Albanese “gaffe” (such as it was) of forgetting the unemployment rate is that it enabled any discussion around economic policy to drift into the trivial. There really is no reason anyone outside a contestant on Hard Quiz, whose topic is the current level of unemployment, needs to know offhand any economic figures. I research wages and the labour market as a job and yet I always need to go back to the ABS page to discover the seemingly most obvious things, such as the current growth of GDP, the wage growth or even the unemployment rate. Certainly, there is no moment ever in the job of being prime minister where someone is going to rush into the office and yell “we need to know the unemployment rate right now, prime minister, don’t look on the internet, tell us now!” And if there is, then we are all truly stuffed. The only time such information is needed to be remembered is during a campaign when journalists ask the question thinking it matters, or if they are asked in it question time – and then it is only considered important because journalists will write that the PM did not know it and that he should because … “reasons”. Far more important is to know the impact of your policies and whether the unemployment rate is missing anything important. Now I am certainly not in the camp that we can ignore the unemployment rate. It is a good measure for what it claims to be, and there really is nothing that is improved in the economy when unemployment rises. But when the unemployment rate falls, that does not necessarily mean all things (or indeed many things) are improved. And any discussion of employment should always go to what kind of work – how secure is it? How well does it pay? How are the conditions? Looking at the recovery needs a bit more than just telling us a number of people are in work, or that a certain percentage of those in the labour force are still looking for work. Economic debate needs to be more than journalists acting like quizshow hosts. Consider that back in February 2020, before the pandemic punched the economy in the solar plexus, 80% of all waged employees (ie excluding owner-managers) had access to paid leave. That does not make them permanent – it includes many whose work remains insecure. They could for example be on short-term contracts, but it is at least a “non-casual” level of employment. And yet mostly they were the ones spared the massive loss of work during the pandemic: If the graph does not display click here Nearly three-quarters of the employment lost from February 2020 to May 2020 was casual work – and 40% of all employment loss was women who worked casual. That is a truly astounding number given they made up just 13% of all waged employees. And so it has been with the recovery. Yes there has been a strong return of work, but overwhelmingly it has been in casual work: If the graph does not display click here Consider that part-time casual women employee made up 10% of all waged-employees, but accounted for 17% of the recovery of work. So yes, great to have a recovery. But how secure it is? One area in which we can see the insecurity is that while the numbers of people unemployed has fallen, the numbers of people on jobSeeker or the youth allowance is now higher than it was before the pandemic: If the graph does not display click here Now there are few reasons why this has occurred, and a major one is that in September 2020 the government raised the amount of income you could earn before you lost eligibility to be on jobseeker. This does not explain it all – there is clearly an increase in those who are sick and eligible for jobseeker now, compared with before the pandemic – but it also points to an important issue about how we look at unemployment. To no longer be eligible to receive jobseeker, a single person needs to earn more than $1,253.50 a fortnight – essentially right on the poverty rate in September last year of $1,225.30. But we should note that about 80% of those on jobseeker do not earn any income. For them, the poverty line is miles away, and further now than in the past. If the graph does not display please click here This week Labor announced they would not be raising it, and neither will the LNP. And yet both are committed to the Stage 3 tax cuts which will deliver up to a $9,075 cut for someone earning over $200,000. If the graph does not display click here As Amy Remeikis noted on Wednesday, the Stage 3 cuts, which are due to come into effect in the 2024-25 financial year, are expected to cost $17bn a year, while increasing jobseeker by $95 a week would cost about $5bn a year. Debating why you would do one and not the other might actually be an economic debate worth having.

4/14/2022,"Record crowds at Melbourne’s Grand Prix and comedy festival have boosted foot traffic in the CBD, with pedestrian activity in the heart of the city exceeding pre-pandemic levels by 15% over the weekend. Melbourne CBD’s office occupancy is still lagging, with average attendance at 30%, according to March data from the Property Council. Wednesdays and Thursdays are the city’s busiest days – with over 70% of pre-pandemic foot traffic. Mondays and Fridays – the most popular days for people to work at home – continue to languish with office occupancy as low as 17%. Lord mayor Sally Capp said pent-up demand over the past two years had “manifested itself in record crowds over the weekend”. “The foot traffic figures show Melbourne literally was bursting on the weekend,” she said. “The positive momentum that we’ve seen this year is really taking the next big stride forward with week-on-week foot traffic, at Southbank for example, up 66%. That tells us that that over-caution moving to Covid confidence is something that’s here to stay.” The City of Melbourne’s pedestrian sensor on Swanston Street – in the heart of the CBD – recorded pre-pandemic levels of 115% on Saturday and Sunday. It recorded 93% on Monday and 95% on Tuesday. The weekend’s Grand Prix – the first held after three years – drew record crowds of more than 419,000 spectators. The kick off of the AFL season last month and the Melbourne comedy festival – running throughout April – have also drawn visitors back into the city. A department of transport spokesperson said it was great to see big events also drive higher usage of the state’s roads and public transport network. “We continue to support all Victorians returning to the road and public transport network, whether it’s heading to the office or classroom, to the footy or a concert or to visit loved ones.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning This week the Andrews government also confirmed Victoria would host the 2026 Commonwealth Games, with most of the events at four hubs in regional parts of the state. The opening ceremony will be held at Melbourne’s MCG. Capp said the decentralised major sporting event would still add to the city’s “positive momentum”, with Melbourne likely to be a hub for travellers, athletes and their support team. “There is so much work to do between now and 2026. To host those games across Victoria, and Melbourne will play a central role in all of that,” she said. “We recognise the value in building new affordable accommodation and new community infrastructure that creates a legacy from the games in the regions around Victoria. But we also know that Melbourne is a home base for both sport and events – we are the events capital of Australia.” Victoria’s Covid cases from the Omicron subvariant are predicted to peak this month, with modelling showing a slow decline of cases in May. The state opposition has called for the close contact seven-day isolation rule to be scrapped, claiming it has plunged the state into a “semi-lockown”. But the the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee has advised governments to scrap the requirement once the current peak of cases has passed. Capp said she was optimistic a rise in cases would not set back the city’s momentum. “People are working out how do we live with this? How do we work with this? How do we become flexible to be able to manage it,” she said. The state government’s lifting of the indoor mask mandate and work-from-home recommendation from February has seen a spike in city employees returning to the CBD. But Melbourne’s office occupancy lags behind the rest of Australia, with Adelaide leading the nation at 61%, Sydney slightly ahead at 41% and Brisbane at 48%.

4/14/2022,"The Morrison government has argued that Labor cannot be trusted to manage the federal budget. Scott Morrison and the finance minister, Simon Birmingham, have both claimed Labor’s pandemic policies would have cost an extra $81bn since 2020. But where did this $81bn figure come from – and is it an accurate reflection of the net impact of Labor’s policies? The claim was first made in a piece by Birmingham in the Australian on 8 February. It was repeated in a follow-up story the next day, accompanied by an infographic sourced to the finance department. But in Senate estimates, Birmingham revealed “the modelling was undertaken within the government” – not by the department – and his office had to call the newspaper to have that attribution corrected. Labor’s shadow finance minister, Katy Gallagher, said the numbers were “cooked up” and “dodgy” because they were produced by the offices of Birmingham and treasurer Josh Frydenberg. The costings include Labor policies, extensions of jobkeeper and the coronavirus supplement. The Labor policies were: The $300 vaccine incentive payment for those who received both doses of the vaccine, at a cost of $6bn Free rapid antigen tests “for all”, which the Coalition estimated to cost $5bn The pandemic support proposals were: Expanding the eligibility of jobkeeper to 2 million more people, including short-term casuals and visa-holders, estimated to cost $25bn Maintaining $1,500 payments for all jobkeeper recipients rather than tapering down and lowering rates for part-time workers ($10bn) Extending jobkeeper for a further quarter to June 2021 ($10bn) Maintaining coronavirus supplement payments at the $550-a-fortnight rate to March 2021, then $350 to June 2021 ($25bn) The vaccine incentive payment cost is not contentious. Anthony Albanese said this would cost $6bn when he announced it in August last year – although by October, Labor said the policy was no longer required. In estimates, Gallagher questioned how the free RAT policy was costed. Birmingham argued if the costings were “ill-defined” it was because the free RAT policy itself was. He suggested $5bn was a “conservative” estimate. The government costings, seen by Guardian Australia, indicate the assumption was for 20 free RATs over six months for all Australians, except concession card holders already entitled under the government scheme. Labor supported jobkeeper in parliament but moved symbolic “second reading amendments” calling on the government to consider expanding it. Outside parliament, shadow ministers did suggest that if Labor had its way the changes to jobkeeper would be law. For example, Labor criticised the exclusion of 1 million casuals with less than 12 months’ service from jobkeeper. “Labor wants to see more workers maintain a connection with their employer – that has been our goal since day one of this crisis,” the shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers and other shadow ministers said in a statement. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning On 1 April 2020, Labor’s Kristina Keneally and Linda Burney wrote to the government asking it “to extend coronavirus support to temporary visa holders and migrant workers in Australia”. When jobkeeper was tapered and cut, Albanese said it was “not the time to withdraw support for the economy”. But in other instances the expansion or extension of the program was qualified, and the government costings do not take this into account. For example, Chalmers called in March 2021 for a “temporary, responsible, targeted extension of the JobKeeper program, not for everyone and not forever, but for those businesses which are still impacted”. Rolling over the $10bn cost of jobkeeper from the March quarter into June inflates the cost, in those circumstances. The cost of extending the coronavirus supplement on jobseeker is questionable. When the payment was reduced from $550 to $250 per fortnight in September 2020, Albanese criticised the “substantial reduction” but it’s not clear Labor was committed to keeping the old rate. The government costings assume Labor was in favour of keeping the $550 per fortnight coronavirus supplement until March 2021, but an amendment by Burney, the shadow social services minister, only called for $250 per fortnight. Chalmers said the “highest priority” was to commit to a permanent increase to the jobseeker rate, which the government did in February 2021 with a $50 per fortnight rise. Since then, Labor has accepted that rate and won’t even review it in government. The government’s costings assume that Labor was up for a $350 per fortnight coronavirus supplement for the June 2021 quarter, because in March 2021 Labor senators voted for a Greens Senate motion calling on the government to “urgently increase jobseeker payment to be above the poverty line”. This is based on what the Australian Council of Social Services was calling for, not Labor’s policy at the time (which was $250 a fortnight) or what they’ve settled for now ($50 a fortnight extra). The $81bn claim seeks to make Labor wear the increased cost of the measures, without Labor being able to point to the positive impact if the government had adopted their ideas. Presumably Australia’s jobs recovery would have been even stronger if more casuals were included in jobkeeper, and workforce shortages would have been shorter or less severe if rapid antigen tests were more available over summer. And once you’ve set your coordinates for the universe of counterfactuals, where does it end? Maybe the $19.7bn paid to companies whose revenues actually increased over the life of the $89bn jobkeeper program would not have been spent if it were better designed to begin with. If treasury had implemented a clawback mechanism after the first three months of jobkeeper, perhaps some of the $15.6bn paid to businesses that didn’t have the required revenue downturn in the September 2020 quarter would have been recouped? It is true that if Labor’s prescriptions were followed, more would likely have been spent on jobkeeper and jobseeker during the pandemic. And there is no such thing as a free RAT. It is questionable that the sum of these and other Labor policies is as high as $81bn, given Labor wanted to narrow the eligibility for jobkeeper as it was phased out and the assumptions that inflate the costing of the coronavirus supplement.",News/Australia news,Factcheck: Are Coalition claims Labor’s pandemic policies would have cost an extra $81bn accurate?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/14/factcheck-are-coalition-claims-labors-pandemic-policies-would-have-cost-an-extra-81bn-accurate
4/14/2022,"Holidaymakers trying to get away for the Easter weekend have been warned they are likely to face disruption whether travelling by air, rail, road or sea. Staff sickness and a shortage of workers have already caused multiple days of chaos for air passengers, with carriers cancelling dozens of flights at short notice, while ferry operators have struggled to meet demand as P&O Ferries services remain suspended. Travellers have been told they face delays over the bank holiday weekend, and may even have difficulties reaching their destination, regardless of how they travel, amid widespread closures to the rail network and predictions of “huge surges” of vehicles on motorways. The Easter weekend is the first public holiday since the lifting of almost all Covid travel restrictions, and traditionally signifies the start of the busier spring and summer season. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said in a BBC interview it would be “extremely busy on our roads, potentially at our ports, particularly at Dover”. Network Rail, which owns and operates Britain’s railways, has advised passengers to travel either side of the long weekend because it is closing parts of the system to carry out engineering works. Trains running on the west coast main line, which links London to Scotland, will start and finish at Milton Keynes between Friday 15 and Monday 18 April, while Euston station in north London will also be closed. Parts of the railway between Birmingham International station and Coventry will also be closed, as will lines around Crewe station. The railway closures will affect tens of thousands of Liverpool and Manchester City football fans travelling to Wembley stadium in London to watch their teams compete in the FA Cup semi-final. A crowd of 90,000 is expected, but the FA has advised ticketholders not to take the train from the north-west. The Football Association said it was chartering 100 buses from Anfield and the Etihad Stadium to transport up to 5,000 supporters from each club . An spokesperson said approximately 2,000 seats were still available on buses for Liverpool supporters. The chair of Network Rail, Sir Peter Hendy, recently told MPs on parliament’s transport select committee that the FA had scheduled the men and women’s fixtures in the capital, despite ample warning of railway closures. “Network Rail told the FA in 2019 that we were closing the west coast main line, yet they seem to have arranged a football match between Manchester and Liverpool at Wembley on a day when we have effectively given the world two years’ notice of the closure,” Hendy said. Airline passengers have faced lengthy queues in terminals to clear security in recent weeks, while thousands of travellers flying from Manchester airport missed their flights as a result. It came after the surge in passengers coincided with high rates of staff off work with Covid, and a wider shortage of workers after many were laid off during the pandemic. Manchester airport has warned passengers they will continue to wait for up to 90 minutes to get through security, while there is also some disruption expected for those flying from Birmingham, as well as Heathrow and Gatwick. “I would be surprised if there are not further difficulties,” said Wayne King, the regional coordinating officer at Unite union. “Any time that there are school holidays, this will peak because there are just not going to be the staff.” Shapps said he was concerned that airlines and airport and port operators needed to “ensure they get back to strength, and quickly” after large-scale redundancies during the Covid crisis. “We have been warning them for a long time that they would need to gear up again.” Travellers may also find it harder to reach the airport. The Piccadilly line on the London Underground will not serve any of Heathrow’s terminals at the weekend, while there will be fewer trains stopping at Gatwick because of works at the station. Pressure on cross-Channel ferry operators at Dover and on Eurotunnel services looks unlikely to ease in time for the weekend, after another P&O Ferries vessel was revealed on Wednesday to have been detained, after surveyors identified “a number of deficiencies”. Two of P&O’s Dover-based ships that usually sail five times a day to Calais are being investigated by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. Miles-long queues of freight traffic and holidaymakers hoping to cross the Channel have caused congestion for residents and businesses in Kent. Motorists in other parts of the country may also face traffic jams over the weekend. Drivers are expected to take more than 21m leisure journeys by car this weekend, according to estimates from the RAC, which it said was the highest number for an Easter holiday since it started tracking plans in 2014. The motoring organisation predicts Good Friday will be the busiest day of the weekend. “We expect to see huge surges in traffic and delays around airports and motorways. Last weekend, many drivers tried to get ahead of the rush and we saw a 27% increase in driven miles on Waze compared to pre-Covid driving levels,” said Ru Roberts, the UK manager of the navigation app Waze. Roberts added that traffic could also be affected by drivers looking for competitively priced fuel or forecourts not affected by disruption to deliveries as a result of Just Stop Oil protesters, who have blockaded oil terminals.",News/UK news,"Easter travel disruption to hit air, rail, road and sea in UK",https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/apr/13/easter-travel-disruption-uk-flights-cancelled-air-rail-road-sea
4/14/2022,"Conservative MPs have their public reasons why Boris Johnson should not resign after his fine for breaches of lockdown regulations, and also private motives for wanting him to stay in office. There is not much overlap between the two. Both discredit the party and degrade British democracy. The official lines are that Mr Johnson has apologised for an accidental misdemeanour, that he has reformed his Downing Street operation and that his leadership is indispensable given the fact of war in Ukraine. The first of those defences is meaningless, the second is untrue and the third is repugnant. The word “sorry” has no value issued from Mr Johnson’s mouth. Disregard for truth is the core of his misdeeds. He misled parliament – a resigning matter in itself if the ministerial code is properly followed – and now tries to wriggle his way off the hook. Sincere apology is not in his repertoire. On reforming Downing Street, he cannot change the culture of rule-breaking and indiscipline since he is its progenitor. The only reform that would make a difference is his departure. As for Ukraine, the arrogation of that country’s torment as a device to protect a prime minister who is not himself at war is beyond cynical. There is no reason to suppose that Mr Johnson is the only person capable of managing an international crisis, and good reason to think that a leader who obeys the law might manage the crisis better. Such a person would have more moral authority to make the principled case in defence of democracy. It is revealing that most Tory MPs seem to think no such person exists on their benches. The absence of a successor is one reason they really want Mr Johnson to stay. Rishi Sunak’s prospects are ruined by his embroilment in the partygate scandal, coming on top of awkward revelations about his family’s tax arrangements and a botched spring financial statement. No other candidate has the courage to incite regicide. A second factor is local elections next month. Conservatives are waiting to see what polling damage is done by their leader’s turpitude before deciding whether to jettison him. Plenty of Tories think Mr Johnson is unfit to hold his office. Many were saying it aloud earlier this year. They might now camouflage their qualms in credulous claims about their leader’s capacity for contrition, or bury them in bogus arguments about an international emergency, but no one is fooled. The self-serving, tactical calculation is too obvious. The attempt to dress it as anything nobler insults the public. It is an affront to everyone who obeyed the lockdown rules and who made sacrifices on an understanding of shared national interest and communal solidarity – values that the prime minister can invoke for theatrical effect, but not comprehend. In the absence of a general election, it falls to Conservative MPs to attempt a restoration of propriety and decency to Downing Street. They might give any range of excuses for not doing it, but the true reason, plain for all to see, is that they prefer to prolong a reign of ethical dereliction.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Tory support for Boris Johnson: dereliction of duty | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/13/the-guardian-view-on-tory-support-for-boris-johnson-dereliction-of-duty
4/14/2022,"Nothing signals the arrival of spring for a Flat racing fan quite like the sight of the winter favourite for the 2,000 Guineas stepping back on to a racecourse, and Native Trail did everything his supporters could have hoped for – and enough to take another cut in the Classic betting – in a three-and-a-half-length win in the Craven Stakes. Charlie Appleby’s colt was unbeaten in four starts last season. While he has not grown significantly taller over the winter, he was such a strapping two-year-old that there was no real need. What matters is that Native Trail’s engine, retains all its power, for all that it takes him a few strides to work his way through the gears, and the win on Wednesday was similar to his victory in the Dewhurst Stakes last autumn. A slight flat spot around two furlongs out was followed by a withering gallop to the line, with the 1-4 favourite increasing his advantage with every stride once he reached the rising ground. “I was always happy, even when he came under the pump,” Appleby said. “Everybody in the stands thought we were under pressure but we know this horse. That’s what we saw in the National Stakes [at the Curragh] as well, under the pump, give him a smack, he picks up. “What I love about him is that he does it all the right way round. He’s not a free traveller or doing too much, so you think: what’s he going to find? When he hits that rising ground, he’s going to keep finding all the way to the line.” Native Trail was briefly available at 2-1 and then 7-4 for the 2,000 Guineas after the race, but he soon settled at 6-4 for the Classic, with his stable companion Coroebus next in the betting at 7-2 and Aidan O’Brien’s Luxembourg, the Vertem Futurity winner, at about 9-2. Appleby suggested last October, after Coroebus’s win in the Autumn Stakes, that the bookies might have his horses the wrong way round in the Classic betting. Coroebus pleased the trainer in a pre-racing gallop on the Rowley Mile on Wednesday morning and, while Native Trail is now certain to start favourite for the Guineas, Appleby still feels Coroebus is well worth his chance in the Classic.

He has been tightened up as favourite for the Guineas, but I’m sure James [Doyle] is happy to jump on Coroebus.” Appleby, Britain’s champion trainer for the first time last year, went on to complete a treble on the card which included New London’s impressive success in a 10-furlong novice event. “He’ll go into a Derby trial now,” he said. “I didn’t want to dive straight into one as on home evidence, he’s still a big baby.

4/14/2022,"Emmanuel Macron has declined to follow Joe Biden’s example in labelling Russia’s actions in Ukraine as genocide, arguing that an “escalation of words” would not help bring peace. The French president’s remarks drew an angry response from Kyiv, particularly his apparent argument that the term “genocide” did not apply because Ukrainians and Russians were “brotherly people”. The spokesman for Ukraine’s foreign ministry, Oleh Nikolenko, called Macron’s remarks disappointing. “‘Brotherly’ people don’t kill children, don’t shoot civilians, don’t rape women, don’t mutilate the elderly, and don’t destroy the homes of other ‘brotherly’ people. Even the fiercest enemies don’t commit atrocities against defenseless people,” Nikolenko said. Biden accused Moscow of committing genocide late on Tuesday, saying, “Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being Ukrainian.” “And the evidence is mounting,” he said. “More evidence is coming out of the horrible things that the Russians have done in Ukraine. And we’re going to only learn more and more about the devastation. We’ll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me.” The US ambassador to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Michael Carpenter, made clear on Wednesday that the president’s comments did not represent an official US legal position. Carpenter said Biden had made a “clear moral determination” but added that a legal review was under way and that it is “going to take some time to be completed”. Asked to comment on Biden’s accusation of genocide, Macron said that it was clear the Russian army had committed war crimes, but added: “I am prudent with terms today. “Genocide has a meaning. The Ukrainian people and Russian people are brotherly people,” he said. “It’s madness what’s happening today. It’s unbelievable brutality and a return to war in Europe. But at the same time I look at the facts, and I want to continue to try the utmost to be able to stop the war and restore peace. I’m not sure if the escalation of words serves our cause.” Another US ally, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, also stopped short of using the term “genocide” on Wednesday, though he said Putin should be “held to account” for war crimes and atrocities in Ukraine. Biden has been consistently outspoken in denouncing Russian wholesale killing of Ukrainian civilians, labelling Putin as a “war criminal” in mid-March. Multiple investigations are under way into Russian atrocities in Ukraine, which include the razing of Mariupol and the executions of civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. The chief prosecutor from the international criminal court (ICC), Karim Khan, visited Bucha on Wednesday and declared: “Ukraine is a crime scene,” adding that there were “reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the court are being committed”. The three categories of crimes under ICC jurisdiction in Ukraine are war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. A fourth crime, conducting a war of aggression, has been excluded by Khan under ICC rules as neither Ukraine nor Russia are state parties to the court. The Ukrainian government and some international lawyers have called for a special tribunal to be set up specifically to try Putin and his regime for the crime of aggression. Proving a case under the 1948 Genocide Convention requires an “intent [by the accused] to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. Biden first used the word in passing on Tuesday at a domestic policy event in Iowa about the use of ethanol in petrol. “Your family budget, your ability to fill up your tank, none of it should hinge on whether a dictator declares war and commits genocide half a world away,” he said. Questioned later on whether he intended to apply the term to Russians actions in Ukraine, Biden told journalists: “Yes, I called it genocide because it’s become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being Ukrainian.” His comments were quickly welcomed by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who applauded what he called the “true words of a true leader”. “Calling things by their names is essential to stand up to evil,” Zelenskiy said on Twitter. “We are grateful for US assistance provided so far and we urgently need more heavy weapons to prevent further Russian atrocities.” Before his invasion, Putin described Ukrainian separate existence as illegitimate, as he argued that Russians and Ukrainians were one people. As well as wholesale killing of civilians, Russia has been accused of the forcible transfer of captured Ukrainian civilians into Russia, including large numbers of children, while changing the rules to make it easier for Russian families to adopt them. Determining the line between crimes against humanity and genocide has sometimes proved difficult and divisive. The international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ruled that the slaughter of Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica constituted genocide but not the mass killings carried out by Serb forces in other municipalities, a distinction that outraged the populations of the other devastated towns.",News/World news,Macron declines to follow Biden and call Russian acts in Ukraine ‘genocide’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/emmanuel-macron-genocide-ukraine-russia-biden
4/14/2022,"Finland and Sweden took a major step towards joining Nato on Wednesday, after their prime ministers said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had changed Europe’s “whole security landscape” and “dramatically shaped mindsets” in the Nordic countries. The Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, said on Wednesday that her country, which shares a 1,300km (810-mile) border with Russia, would decide whether to apply to join the alliance “quite fast, in weeks not months”, despite the risk of infuriating Moscow. Russia has repeatedly warned both countries against joining Nato and would see any such move as a provocation. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has said that if Finland and Sweden entered Nato, Russia would have to “rebalance the situation” with its own measures. Speaking alongside her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, at a joint press conference in Stockholm, Marin said Finland had to be “prepared for all kinds of actions from Russia” and that “everything had changed” when Moscow attacked Ukraine. “The difference between being a partner and a member is very clear, and will remain so. There is no other way to have security guarantees than under Nato’s deterrence and common defence as guaranteed by the alliance’s article 5,” she said. Article 5, the 30-member alliance’s collective defence cornerstone, states that an attack on one Nato member is an attack on all. It has only been invoked once in the organisation’s history, in response to the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. Andersson said there was “no point” in delaying analysis of whether it was right for Sweden to apply for Nato membership. “There is a before and after 24 February,” she said, referring to the date on which Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. “This is a very important time in history. The security landscape has completely changed. We have to analyse the situation to see what is best for Sweden’s security, for the Swedish people, in this new situation.” A Finnish government white paper, released on Wednesday, on the country’s “fundamentally changed” security environment made no recommendation on Nato but will serve as the basis for a parliamentary debate after Easter. “I think people’s mindsets in Finland, also in Sweden, changed and were shaped very dramatically by Russia’s actions,” Marin said. “This is very clear and that caused a need for a process in Finland to have a discussion about our own security choices.” She said Finland needed “to be very frank about consequences and the risks. There are both short-term and more long-term risks. These risks are there both if we apply and if we do not apply.” A recent opinion poll showed 68% of Finnish respondents were in favour of joining the alliance, more than double the figure before the invasion, with only 12% against. Polling in Sweden suggests a slim majority of Swedes now also back membership. Both countries are officially non-aligned militarily, but became Nato partners – taking part in exercises and exchanging intelligence – after abandoning their previous stance of strict neutrality when they joined the EU in 1995 after the end of the cold war. Finland declared independence in 1917 after more than a century of Russian rule, and its heavily outnumbered army twice fought off Soviet forces during the second world war before ceding some border territory. Sweden has not fought a war for 200 years. Sweden’s ruling centre-left Social Democrats, led by Andersson, this week began debating whether the country should drop its opposition to joining Nato, abandoning a decades-long belief that peace was best kept by not publicly choosing sides. The question is expected to be a key issue in parliamentary elections on 11 September, with centre-right opposition parties already saying they would back a Nato application and the far-right Sweden Democrats also open to the idea. Many commentators expect the two Nordic nations to act in tandem on whether to join, although Finland – widely seen as likely to apply before a Nato summit in Madrid scheduled for June – looks closer than Sweden. A Swedish security policy review is expected to be completed before the end of May and Andersson has said she will await its outcome before making any decisions. However, a positive Finnish decision would put pressure on Sweden to follow suit. Both countries have received public assurances from the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, that their applications would be welcome, as well as expressions of support from members including the US, UK, Germany and France. Any membership application must be accepted by all 30 Nato states, which could take four months to a year.",News/World news,Finland and Sweden take major step towards joining Nato,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/finland-and-sweden-could-apply-for-nato-membership-in-weeks
4/14/2022,"It’s a heady time in politics, when so much of our debate centres on what it means to lie. If Boris Johnson didn’t think he was at a party, yet others at the party did, is that a lie? If Rishi Sunak comes out studs first on the matter of his wife’s non-domiciled status, claiming it as a mere function of her nationality, only for that to be debunked by tax experts in a matter of minutes, was that a lie? Or merely a man experimenting with different lines, to see which would hold? These are obviously the pressing questions of the moment, but I find myself more transfixed by a wonderful book, Tremors in the Blood, published today by the tech journalist Amit Katwala. It tells the story of the lie detector, from the first, gripping murder case for which it was conceived, up to its use today in the justice system. Currently, we exist in a bizarre contradiction: scientifically, lie detection has been debunked. It simply isn’t possible to override a person’s words and listen to their body instead. The author quotes two academics from Northumbria Law School, Marion Oswald and Kyriakos Kotsoglou, who concluded after extensive meta-analysis: “We cannot stress enough that ever since the first deployment of the polygraph, appellate courts, scientific organisations, and last but not least academic discourse have continuously and nearly unanimously criticised, and rejected this method as unscientific.” That is not what’s puzzling, either to Katwala or to any casual observer; rather, if the polygraph has been so roundly discredited for so long, why do probation services, as well as the justice system in general, still use it? There have been periods when parallel ideas – which sought, with the certainty and neutrality of science, to clean up the messiness of human veracity and behaviour – have been tested and discarded. In the 60s and 70s, psychiatrists and forensic psychologists were very excited by the idea of electric aversion therapy for sex offenders – literally, showing paedophilic images to offenders at the same time as administering electric shocks. It worked on paper; it did not work on humans. The motive driving polygraph enthusiasts was similar – wouldn’t it be great if science could simply solve a problem, render it in black and white? But the dream was different: lie detection seeks not to modify a behaviour but to reach beneath questions of judgment and uncertainty, and discover the truth as something immovable. In many ways, the idea of the polygraph contains the same fallacies as torture, without the cruelty: that the mind can lie, but the body can’t. In fact, the body can lie perfectly well. To crave a world in which deceit is impossible is a natural thing. You might lose a bit of poetry and drama, but you’d gain a lot of clarity. It’s a piquant time to consider that craving, since the conventions of our politics are built on that perfect world. We conduct our meaningful debate in an environment in which it is considered impossible for a person to be lying. This is not naivety, but a necessary premise: if parliamentarians may or may not be telling the truth, if the veracity of their statements has to be tested against the facts, then that’s not a debating chamber but a rather ornate court of law; you cannot make law in a courtroom. So even if for centuries there have been members whose truthfulness you doubt a bit, those bad apples have never been reason enough to overturn the presumption of honesty, not because the apples weren’t bad, but because the presumption is so important. One felt for Keir Starmer on Tuesday. It looked like an open goal, but there are only so many times you can call the prime minister a liar before it dents your own professionalism and standing. You don’t sound like a politician, you just sound like one of his wives. But even if it can feel ridiculous, to consider parliament as a utopia of truth, this crisis has only underlined how important it is; long after this government has resigned or had their resignation handed to them by the electorate, we will remember the impossibilism of civic life where honesty couldn’t be assumed.

4/14/2022,"One of Britain’s most prestigious women’s cycling races is on the verge of being saved 24 hours after its longstanding sponsor pulled out in protest at British Cycling’s suspension of its transgender policy. The Women’s CiCLE classic in Melton, Leicestershire, which has been won by the Tokyo Olympic medallists Katie Archibald and Neah Evans, had looked to be an unwitting victim of British Cycling’s decision to bar the trans woman cyclist Emily Bridges racing against female riders pending a review. This move came after numerous members – and voices within the sport – raised concerns that Bridges, who broke the national junior 25-mile record as a male before transitioning, would have an unfair advantage in the female category due to retained strength and other advantages. However, others, including the main sponsor of the Women’s CiCLE race, Peter Stanton, strongly disagreed. On Tuesday he withdrew his £15,000 sponsorship in protest – leaving the women’s and junior race on the same day in June under threat. The men’s event, later this month, was unaffected. On Wednesday Sex Matters and Fair Play for Women, two groups campaigning for sex-based rights, made a formal offer to make up the cash shortfall so that all events can take place. The CiCLE Classics race director, Colin Clews, acknowledged the bid and said that he “had been overwhelmed by messages of support for women’s cycling”. He said: “We will consider all offers of sponsorship to deliver the race in 2022 and support its future development.” Dr Emma Hilton, a director of Sex Matters, said they had offered to ride to the rescue because female cyclists needed their own races for “brilliant women to race fairly and competitively”. A similar message was conveyed by Dr Nicola Williams, the director of Fair Play for Women, who said: “We believe there should be a place for everyone in sport, but fair competition for women depends on keeping it female-only.” Under British Cycling’s previous policy, trans women were allowed to compete if they reduced their testosterone levels below 5 nmol/L for a 12-month period. However, the emergence of Bridges, who began hormone therapy last year as part of her gender dysphoria treatment and raced in men’s events until February, led to a hasty rethink. Stanton said he believed that the decision was “totally unacceptable” and that by withdrawing his sponsorship he could show his support for the transgender community. “Whilst fully supportive of women’s sport, I also have many friends and colleagues within the transgender community whom I feel that I would be letting down if I did not make a stand to show my support for their rights,” he said. “This is not the first case of a transgender rider competing under UCI rules, or even as part of an official UCI team, and to arbitrarily change that position based on one individual case, I find totally unacceptable. I am desperately saddened by the Emily Bridges case and the actions that it has prompted me to take.”",Sport/Sport,Campaign groups to save women’s cycling classic hit by trans rights row,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/13/campaign-groups-to-save-womens-cycling-classic-hit-by-trans-rights-row
4/14/2022,"China’s trade with Russia jumped by more than 12% in March from a year earlier, outpacing the increase in Beijing’s trade with the rest of the world, according to Chinese customs data. Shipments to and from Russia increased 12.76% in March to $11.67bn, Chinese customs data showed on Wednesday, slowing from 25.7% growth in February, when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. The decline in trade with Russia was less severe than the decline with other countries, fuelling concerns that China has maintained strong links with Moscow despite the atrocities perpetrated by the Russian military in Ukraine. China’s growth in trade during March with the rest of the world was only 7.75%, after it increased to $505bn. Beijing has refused to call Russia’s action an invasion and has repeatedly criticised what it says are illegal western sanctions to punish Moscow. Several weeks before the attack on Ukraine, China and Russia declared a “no-limits” strategic partnership, whereby there are no forbidden areas of cooperation. Last year, total trade between China and Russia jumped 35.8% to a record $147bn. As sanctions against Russia mount, western countries fear China could offset some of its neighbour’s pain by buying more from it. Russia is a major source of oil, gas, coal and agricultural commodities for China. But analysts told Reuters they have yet to see any major indication China is violating western sanctions on Russia. A spokesperson for Chinese customs, Li Kuiwen, said China’s economic and trade cooperation with other countries including Russia and Ukraine remains normal. A group of German policy institutes said Germany could be plunged into recession if Europe’s largest economy is forced to block imports of Russian gas. German GDP would fall by 2.2% next year after a full EU embargo on Russian energy, wiping out more than 400,000 jobs, according to revised estimates of German GDP growth over the next two years. The EU last week agreed to ban coal imports from Russia from August. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is under pressure to agree tougher measures, including a ban on gas imports. Germany depends on Russia for 40% of its gas imports. The research institutes predicted that if all energy supplies from Russia were cut off instantly, growth in Europe’s largest economy would slow sharply from 2.9% last year to 1.9% this year, before shrinking in 2023. They said: “The cumulative loss of GDP in 2022 and 2023 in the event of a supply freeze is likely to be about €220bn [£180bn].” Without a ban on energy imports from Russia, the institutes said growth this year would be 2.7% compared with a previous estimate of 4.8% made last autumn. The German government said it is working to reduce that dependency, but said it needs time to exit Russian gas altogether and has opposed an immediate stop to supplies.",News/World news,China’s trade with Russia up by 12% in March from a year earlier,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/chinas-trade-with-russia-up-by-12-in-march-from-a-year-earlier
4/14/2022,"Cometh the hour, cometh the man. In the end it had come down to a two-horse race between Nadine Dorries and Grant Shapps to take on the morning media round as they had been the only members of the Tory Wankocracy stupid enough to answer their phones. Even James Cleverly, aka Jimmy Dimly, had remembered to switch his mobile to silent. And while there was little to choose between Nadine’s and Grant’s abject, needy loyalty to Boris Johnson, No 10 thought that on balance Shapps was the better bet. Nadine was just too much of a liability and could lash out – she might even embarrass herself by threatening to cut ITV’s public funding – while Grant was just perfect. In his Michael Green get-rich-quick persona, he had just the qualities required. No one could talk shit quite so shamelessly. And with such utter contempt for his audience. Shapps began every interview by saying how disappointed he had been. He never made clear what it was exactly that he was disappointed about, though the longer he went on, the more it seemed that what saddened him the most was that the Convict had been caught. Boris’s real crime was getting found out. In the Platonic Johnsonian world to which Grant was a paid-up subscriber, the good guys were the bad guys who always got away with it. To be collared by the Met and be fined £50 was not part of the script. He didn’t even make a pretence of trying to defend Rishi Sunak. The chancellor is toast, having not had the self-worth to resign. It was like this, said Shapps. The prime minister was mortified to have been caught breaking the law and had apologised for that. And if Shapps could find it in his heart to accept that apology and forgive him, then the rest of us ought to be able to do so too. He seemed to imply you had to be completely heartless not to accept the self-pitying contrition of a serial liar. After all, the Convict had even paid the fixed-penalty notice. Shapps said this as if it was in some way surprising and was something for which we should be profoundly grateful. Perhaps we should. Boris isn’t known for readily paying his debts. Having done his utmost to minimise the crime, Shapps went on to trivialise it still further. All that Johnson had done was walk into the wrong room by mistake. If he had only just kept going and gone up to his flat, then none of this would have happened. Instead he had wandered into the cabinet room to find himself ambushed by cake, booze, colleagues, his wife and the interior designer. And possibly Dilyn the dog. So he had naturally assumed he was in yet another, unscheduled work meeting. Grant’s killer line was that we had to remember the prime minister was a total idiot who couldn’t recognise a party when he was at one. There had never been any intention for the Convict to attend any of the parties for which he was under investigation. He was just a terribly unlucky ingenu with a bad track record of turning up in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was a total coincidence that he had been at so many parties. Not that he had been at any other parties. Or that his birthday party had been a party. It was up to the police to decide what was a party, though he hoped they’d do a better job of it in the future than they had managed on Tuesday. “It wasn’t his intention to lie,” Shapps continued. “There was no malice in anything he did.” Johnson had never set out to break the law. It had just never occurred to him that the law might also apply to him. He had always assumed the rules were for the Little People. As for the lies, the Convict couldn’t be expected to help himself. Lying was what he always did. He had lied to his family, he had lied to his friends and he had lied to the country. And if he had lied to the Queen about the prorogation, there was every possibility that the “Lion of Kyiv” had also lied to President Zelenskiy. So lying to parliament was no big deal. Just grow up and grow some. Johnson was an Honourable Man. An Honourable Liar. Here was the deal: sure, Johnson might have broken the law and lied about it and everything else. Anyone for 42 new hospitals? But his track record spoke for itself. It certainly did. Though not in the way Shapps might have hoped. Inflation is creeping up month by month. The cost of living and energy prices are now critical. Brexit is a disaster with exports down and lorry tailbacks from Dover. The economy is tanking and all the Convict can do is take pleasure in the failure of Sunak’s spring statement. The only area in which Johnson can take credit is his handling of the war in Ukraine. Though that was no reason for not replacing him with someone with a basic respect for the rule of law. And the country. We should be grateful to have such a brilliant leader, Shapps declared. I’d hate to see what a piss-poor leader looked like. But Grant was off on one, rushing on as he wound up several interviews from which he had emerged relatively unscathed. It turns out that lying isn’t such a bad plan after all. Jacob Rees-Mogg was discovering much the same thing on TalkRadio. The rules were wrong and Johnson had set an example by breaking them.

4/14/2022,"The Dutch bank ABN Amro has apologised for its predecessors’ role in the slave trade, after it commissioned an investigation into the “untold suffering” it caused. The investigation, by academics at the International Institute of Social History (IISH), an Amsterdam archive, found that two of ABN Amro’s predecessor companies were involved in either financing the operation of slave plantations directly, or underwriting the trade in products produced by slaves. The global Black Lives Matter protests that followed the murder of George Floyd in the US in 2020 prompted many historical institutions to re-examine their own links to slavery and the slave trade. The Netherlands and other global imperial powers including the UK were deeply involved in the enslavement of millions of people over centuries, and the profits derived from their labour helped to finance the construction of some of Europe’s grandest cities. In the UK the Bank of England, Barclays, HSBC and Lloyd’s of London were among the still extant companies with direct or indirect links to the trade. ABN Amro was itself formerly owned by Royal Bank of Scotland (now NatWest Group), which has also found separate links to slavery. The slave trade was abolished in the Netherlands in 1863. Slavery in Britain became illegal in 1772 and the slave trade in the British empire was abolished in 1807. The two predecessor companies to ABN Amro with links to slavery were Hope & Co, which was “actively involved in the day-to-day business of plantations”, and Mees en Zoonen, which brokered insurance for slave ships and shipments of goods harvested by enslaved people. Both became part of ABN Amro in 2010 after a series of mergers and acquisitions. The bank said Hope & Co “played a pivotal role in the international slave economy of the 18th century”, in a statement published on Wednesday. A previous study had already found that ABN Amro predecessors were involved in slavery in the US. Robert Swaak, ABN Amro’s chief executive, said: “ABN Amro has a proud history going back more than 300 years. However, we must also recognise that it has a darker side as well. ABN Amro as it exists now cannot undo that period of its history. We are aware that, even though slavery has been abolished, the past injustices have persisted. “ABN Amro apologises for the past actions and activities of these predecessors and for the pain and suffering that they caused.” Dr Pepijn Brandon, a senior researcher at the IISH, said: “Hope & Co was the largest financial and commercial company in the Netherlands at the end of the 18th century, and slavery-related operations formed a core part of its business. While Mees & Zoonen was smaller, slavery was an intrinsic part of that firm’s operations as well. “Decisions made in offices in Amsterdam and Rotterdam directly impacted the lives of thousands of enslaved persons.”",News/Business,ABN Amro apologises for historical links to slavery,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/13/abn-amro-apologises-for-historical-links-to-slavery
4/14/2022,"Everton have taken another significant step in the development of their new stadium by signing a main construction contract with Laing O’Rourke. The deal will see the company complete works at Bramley Moore dock and locks in costs for the club, preventing the final bill from spiralling. The new 52,888-capacity stadium on Liverpool’s waterfront is expected to cost in the region of £500m and, despite rising prices throughout the construction industry, the contract gives Everton greater financial certainty over the remaining stages of the build. Laing O’Rourke has repaired and infilled the dock basin, laid foundations and started work on the four corners of the stadium since signing a pre-contract services agreement in February 2021 and an enabling works contract. The main construction contract commits the company to the full construction of the stadium and public realm, and remedial works to a Grade II listed hydraulic tower which is being brought back into public use by Everton. Denise Barrett-Baxendale, Everton’s chief executive, said: “This is an important agreement at a crucial time for the club and the stadium project. We are now able to lock in construction costs, while also benefiting from Laing O’ Rourke’s economies of scale in what is an ever-fluctuating marketplace.” In an email to supporters, the CEO added: “The agreement ensures the work on bringing our new home to reality will continue apace. To explain the significance, this agreement means we have renewed clarity over the costs for the remaining stages of the project – and that clarity is in line with our budget and cost planning. In short – we have certainty in these uncertain times. “Our accounts, released last month, revealed the profound scale of the impact the pandemic has had, and continues to have, on our club. They also demonstrated, though, the scale of investment we have already made in our new stadium – and the unwavering commitment of our owner [Farhad Moshiri] to finish what he has started.” Last month Everton announced a loss of £120.9m for the 2020-21 season, bringing their combined losses for the last three years to a staggering £372m. The relegation-threatened club have also suspended sponsorship deals with companies owned or part-owned by Alisher Usmanov, the oligarch who is a business associate of Moshiri and has been hit with sanctions after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Everton attribute £103m of last year’s losses to the impact of the pandemic and, as the Laing O’Rourke contract underlines, remain on course to relocate to Bramley Moore dock in 2024.",Sport/Football,Everton sign contract to complete new stadium construction,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/13/everton-sign-contract-to-complete-new-stadium-construction
4/14/2022,"Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have been found by police to have broken Covid laws they helped to set. The news has prompted a further wave of anger from people who made sacrifices to help slow the spread of the virus. Here, three people speak about the sacrifices they made during lockdown and their views on Johnson and Sunak’s actions. Hugh Sharp, 82, retired construction worker based in Cramlington, Northumberland When Hugh Sharp walked through the arched red doors of Mayfield cemetery for the funeral of his wife, Margot, in January 2021, the chapel was not how he remembered it. Sharp had visited before, when a friend died a few years previously. He recalled about 100 people turning out. Now it looked sparse and empty. Because of Covid restrictions, only 20 people warmed the pews. “It was terrible,” said Sharp, a retired construction worker and former miner. It felt even worse given how Margot had effortlessly acquired friends wherever she went. “She was a very bubbly person, she loved meeting new people,” he said. “When we went on holiday to Turkey years ago, she met people there she kept in contact with for decades.” When Margot was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2018 – first located in her spine, then spreading to her breast – she and Hugh had been married for almost 60 years. She was three months older. “She used to say I was her toy boy,” Sharp said. Despite endless hospital trips Margot was in good spirits at first, Sharp said. But when Covid hit, he felt she missed out on treatments, and amid social constrictions such as not seeing her three sons, she declined quickly. She died aged 81. When the news broke about Johnson and Sunak, Sharp felt sickened. “I first voted in 1959, and I’ve never known a worse bunch of cheats and liars,” he said. Despite the thin crowd in the chapel on the day of the funeral, outside was a different story. Dozens of friends and neighbours braved freezing weather to pay their respects. “We gave her a good send-off in the end,” he said. Craig Crosthwaite, 59, food bank coordinator in Ardrossan, Scotland Craig Crosthwaite was not just providing food to his local community during the pandemic. He was also driving every fortnight to deliver groceries to his parents, both 80, 60 miles away. “You’d just dump it on the doorstep and step back,” he said. Crosthwaite’s mother has mobility issues. She would typically invite him into the house for a cup of tea, but Crosthwaite would decline each time, reminding her of her vulnerability to Covid. “It was emotionally draining, having to stand at the gate and just see them framed by the doorway, struggling to pick the food up,” he said. The lack of contact has taken a toll. “You feel it qualitatively – no touching, no hugging, no goodbye kisses,” he said. “It’s painful.” For his mother’s 80th, in September 2021, Crosthwaite said he stayed away to minimise potential transmission of the virus. They spoke on the phone. His gift, a new iPad so they could FaceTime more easily, arrived by post. So when Crosthwaite heard the news that Johnson had broken the law on his birthday, he was furious at the prime minister’s “callousness”. “As a Christian, I prayed for that man’s recovery when he was on a ventilator,” he said. “He made the laws, but now he’s smirking and laughing at us all. I’m heartbroken for our nation that we’re headed by somebody with this mindset.” Juliet Greenwood, 55, teacher in East Sussex Like many people, Juliet Greenwood’s job was transformed when Covid hit. She works as a teacher for a peripatetic service for vulnerable children across East Sussex. But during the pandemic, she often found herself pivoting from teaching the curriculum to checking that children’s basic needs were being met. “Lots of kids were at home without pencil and paper,” she said. “One of my jobs ended up being signing families up to food banks.” The impact of Covid restrictions on children was huge, she said. Sacrifices were made to their education and social development to slow the circulation of the virus. One child sticks out in Greenwood’s mind: a boy whose family had recently arrived in the UK. “When I arrived at the doorstep he was incredibly emotional” at seeing a familiar face, Greenwood said. His mother had lost work as a cleaner. Greenwood learned they had hardly left the house in two months. “He was very introverted,” she said. “Children’s behaviour has really changed.” For Greenwood, witnessing first-hand such sacrifices to drive down the virus, while in Westminster Covid was treated as “something exciting”, has meant “people are really angry. Because people’s lives were really, really hard.” What irks her most are Conservative claims that nurses and teachers attended similar parties. “This government wants to bring us all down to a fairly shoddy level,” she said. “The fact that the Conservative party don’t seem to feel like they’ve got the guts to do anything is really disappointing.”",News/World news,‘Boris is laughing at us all’: readers on their lockdowns and the PM’s fine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/boris-is-laughing-at-us-all-readers-on-their-lockdowns-and-pms-fine
4/14/2022,"He was Vladimir Putin’s best friend in Ukraine but the Kremlin says it won’t make a trade to secure his freedom. Viktor Medvedchuk, a man often named the “dark prince” of Ukrainian politics, has been a loyal ally to Putin for two decades, leading a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine for years, even after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the beginning of the deadly war in Donbas. But their ties go even deeper than political alliances. The two have taken holidays together on the Black Sea at Putin’s residence in Sochi and Medvedchuk’s villa in Crimea, and Putin is godfather to Medvedchuk’s daughter, Daria. While Putin has cited his anger over Ukraine’s drift toward Europe and his fear of Nato expansion as reasons for the invasion, some have argued that there may also be an element of personal revenge: the closure by Ukraine of Medvedchuk’s pro-Russian television stations, the seizure of his family’s assets and his eventual placement under house arrest in a treason case that Putin called an “absolute purge of the political field”. For an oil and media baron and longtime confidant to Putin, it was a long way to fall. “They [the Kremlin] viewed him as the main guy in Ukraine, their main interlocutor in Ukraine,” said a former Russian official, who knows Medvedchuk personally. “[Medvedchuk] was the legitimate way they could see their future influence [in Ukraine] … his ‘persecution’ is when this all began.” Shortly before the war began, US intelligence claimed that Medvedchuk had been tapped by the Kremlin for a puppet government in a postwar regime. Within days of the invasion, Medvedchuk disappeared from his Kyiv house arrest, leading many to believe that Russian special forces had managed to spirit him out of the country. But his reappearance in custody has given the Ukrainian government an unexpected bargaining chip, with officials proposing prisoner exchanges and suggesting that Medvedchuk had shared information that would make life unsafe for him in Russia. “I propose to Russia to exchange this man of yours for our boys and our girls who are now in Russian captivity,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, said in a video address on Telegram. Little has been revealed about the operation to recapture Medvedchuk. Photographs released by Ukrainian officials showed him frowning in full military camouflage and handcuffs. The Kremlin has responded to the re-arrest by claiming that Putin has no special relationship with Medvedchuk. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov at first suggested the photographs of Medvedchuk could be fakes and then claimed that Medvedchuk “has never had any behind the scenes relations with Russia”. If he did, Peskov claimed, he would have left Ukraine before the war began. Medvedchuk’s lawyer in February claimed he had escaped house arrest. But when faced with questions about him today, the Kremlin claimed it would not make any trade. “As for the [prisoner] exchange numerous actors in Kyiv have been talking about with so much passion, ardour and pleasure, Medvedchuk is not a Russian citizen and bears no relation to the special military operation. He is a foreign politician,” Peskov said at a press briefing. “Besides, we do not know whether he wants Russia to be involved in any way in the resolution of the … situation he is currently facing.”",News/World news,Who is Viktor Medvedchuk and why does his arrest matter to the Kremlin?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/viktor-medvedchuk-arrest-matter-to-kremlin
4/14/2022,"Teachers in England say they need more time, training and resources to tackle the dangers of pornography in schools, against a backdrop of increasing incidents of pupils taking and sharing sexual images. Delegates to the National Education Union’s annual conference heard that secondary schools were only able to allocate a few hours a year to teach the relationships and sex education (RSE) curriculum in England, giving them little time to discuss issues such as pornography and sexual abuse as they arose. Jon Reddiford, a teacher from north Somerset, told the conference that he had recently experienced “a really horrible set of incidents” at his school involving year 11 pupils that could have been avoided with more RSE teaching in previous years. “It had been going on for a long time before it emerged to staff that a number of the girls were taking explicit photos of themselves and sending them to their boyfriends, which were then being shared around. It later emerged that pressure was being put on the girls by their boyfriends to do this,” Reddiford said. “It needed for the bigger picture to be tackled. The fact that these kind of images were easily available to 15- and 16-year-olds, and the fact that there wasn’t the space in school to discuss them in a way that was appropriate for teenagers … made it much harder for us to deal with it.” Reddiford said it was important for the union to take a stand, “because the impact it had on our year 11s was absolutely massive and we could have dealt with it much better at the time”. The delegates in Bournemouth unanimously passed a motion calling for “properly resourced, high-quality” relationship and sex education in schools and colleges, as well as consistent recording and reporting of sexual harassment, abuse and violence online and off-line. Amy Fletcher, a teacher from Tower Hamlets who moved the motion, said: “We must acknowledge that young people will feel curious about sex, and they may look to pornography if they do not get excellent RSE in schools.” Sarah Byrne, a delegate from Hackney, noted that the NSPCC had found that one in 20 pupils of primary school age had shared nude images with each other. Byrne said staff were expected to teach the current curriculum “with zero training including, crucially, the requirement to address pornography. In my school it would be one hour per fortnight … How are we supposed to promote healthy relations and safeguard our young people in this context, with no time and no training?” Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU, said that young children could be accidentally exposed to porn “because of algorithms” used by social media, with many lacking the maturity to understand or cope. “Relationships and sex education needs to have enough time in the school curriculum to empower young people around the key areas of consent, self-worth and respect, because levels of sexual harassment in schools and across society are deeply entrenched and cause real harm and abuse,” Bousted said.",News/Education,"Schools in England need more resources to address dangers of porn, teachers say",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/13/schools-in-england-need-more-resources-to-address-dangers-of-porn-teachers-say
4/14/2022,"The Home Office’s visa service has apologised for a data breach in which the email addresses of more than 170 people were mistakenly copied into an email circulated last week. More than 170 email addresses were accidentally copied into a message on 7 April 2022 about the change of location for a visa appointment with the UK Visa and Citizenship Application Service. The UKVCAS is run on behalf of the Home Office by the private contractor Sopra Steria. Some of the email addresses appeared to be private Gmail accounts, while others belonged to lawyers from a variety of firms. Just after 5pm on 8 April an email apologising for the data breach was circulated. It referred to a “data breach error” and apologised for any inconvenience caused. It stated: “This email included the email addresses of other customers, which is not our usual practice. It did not include any other personal information. At UKVCAS we take data protection very seriously.” “We are reviewing our internal processes to prevent this error from occurring in the future,” the email added. The original email was recalled and a correct version sent out. Naga Kandiah of MTC Solicitors, one of the recipients of the email, condemned the data breach. He said: “If the Home Office wishes to outsource biometric appointments to a third-party company they have to ensure that their partner is providing a service which is both legally compliant and good value for money. “UKVCAS are charging far in excess of what was previously paid for an appointment at the Post Office yet the product is inferior. For such a high price clients do not expect GDPR breaches or loss of data.” The Home Office previously apologised to hundreds of EU citizens for accidentally sharing their email addresses in April 2019. In the same month the former immigration minister Caroline Nokes apologised to the Windrush generation after about 500 email addresses were mistakenly shared with recipients of a mailing list for the compensation scheme. The Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We do not appear to have received a data breach report from the Home Office on this matter. Not all data breaches need to be reported to the ICO. Organisations must notify the ICO within 72 hours of becoming aware of a personal data breach, unless it does not pose a risk to people’s rights and freedoms. “If an organisation decides that a breach doesn’t need to be reported they should keep their own record of it, and be able to explain why it wasn’t reported if necessary.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We take data protection extremely seriously and there are robust processes in place to prevent breaches. On the rare occasion they do occur, data incidents which meet the appropriate threshold are reported to the Information Commissioner’s Office. Our data protection officer is reviewing this incident to determine whether this threshold has been met.”",News/Technology,Home Office’s visa service apologises for email address data breach,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/13/home-offices-visa-service-apologises-for-email-address-data-breach
