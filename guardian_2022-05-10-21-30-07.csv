5/10/2022,"Unprecedented shortages of food and fuel along with record inflation and blackouts have inflicted widespread misery in Sri Lanka’s most painful downturn since independence from Britain in 1948. Anger over the economic crisis and the government’s handling of the situation has led to month of unrest and calls for the president of Sri Lanka, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, to step down from power. On Monday, his brother, the prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, resigned and the parliament was dissolved as political turmoil intensified and the ruling party further lost its grip on power. Since March, demonstrations have spread across the country of 22 million people as people began to feel the bite of the economic crisis and blamed the government for mishandling the economy and overseeing rampant corruption which has pushed the country to the brink of bankruptcy. Many initially took to the streets despite emergency laws which made demonstrations illegal and gave the government sweeping powers. Over the weekend, the president reinstated the state of emergency he had repealed a few weeks ago. Thousands have been protesting on a daily basis, particularly in Colombo where a vast protest camp was set up outside the office of President’s Gotabaya Rajapaksa, widely known as Gota. Crowds gathered every day calling for him to resign, with “Gota Go Home” the clarion call of the demonstrations. Many of the protests have been peaceful, with Catholic clergy and nunsleading a procession in the capital. However, there was the first death of a protester in April when police in the small town of Rambukkana, 50 miles outside Colombo, fired on a crowd demonstrating against rising fuel prices. On 9 May, protests in Colombo turned violent when pro-government supporters attacked demonstrators with iron bars and wooden rods and police responded with teargas and water cannon, leaving almost 20o injured. Two ruling party MPs were accused of shooting at anti-government protesters in different part of the country. In retaliation, houses and vehicles of several pro-Rajapaksa politicians and the residence of Mahinda Rajapaksa were set on fire. The unrest and dissatisfaction with the government led to Sri Lanka’s entire cabinet apart from the president and, initially, his sibling prime minister, resigning from their posts this week. Rajapaksa sought to form a unity government as public unrest surged over the ruling family’s handling of the economy. His once-powerful coalition is in turmoil after a string of defections, capped by the new finance minister’s resignation just one day after taking office. President Rajapaksa revoked a state of emergency late on 10 May after dozens of lawmakers walked out of the ruling coalition, leaving his government in a minority in parliament. The move was aimed at avoiding a vote on the extraordinary laws in parliament where the government is five short of the 113 seats required for a simple majority. Politically, the possible next steps could include the appointment of a new prime minister replacing the president’s elder brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa, or snap parliamentary elections way ahead of a scheduled vote in 2025. Although the government is now in a minority, there has been no clear signal that opposition legislators will attempt a no-confidence motion to topple it immediately. However, opposition parties have already rebuffed Rajapaksa’s call to join a unity administration led by him and his brother. Nimal Lanza, a former minister who has also abandoned Rajapaksa’s administration, conceded that the ruling party no longer had a mandate to govern. “I beg and appeal to you to take the side of the protesters,” he told parliament, addressing the prime minister, who attended the session but remained silent. A critical lack of foreign currency has left Sri Lanka struggling to service its ballooning $51bn foreign debt, with the pandemic torpedoing vital revenue from tourism and remittances. There have been unprecedented shortages as a result, with no sign of an end to the economic woes. Economists say Sri Lanka’s crisis has been exacerbated by government mismanagement, years of accumulated borrowing and ill-advised tax cuts. The foreign exchange shortage forced the government to announce the closure of three of its diplomatic missions in Norway, Iraq and Australia. Three others, in Nigeria, Germany and Cyprus, were shut in January. A doctors’ body told the government there was an acute shortage of medicines that could collapse the health system. “Failure to assure a continuous and adequate supply of essential medical drugs will lead to collapse of the entire health system,” it told the health ministry in a letter. “This will create a life-threatening situation to our citizens who are already facing an unprecedented crisis situation,” the Government Medical Officers Association said. During the protests in the capital, more than 60 people have been arrested in connection with unrest and many have said they were tortured in police custody. The UN Human Rights Council said it was closely watching the deteriorating situation in Sri Lanka, which is already facing international censure over its human rights record. “The drift towards militarisation and the weakening of institutional checks and balances in Sri Lanka have affected the state’s ability to effectively tackle the economic crisis,” the UNHRC said.",News/World news,Why are people protesting in Sri Lanka?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/why-are-people-protesting-in-sri-lanka
5/10/2022,"The Queen’s speech, which set out the government’s legislative agenda for the next parliamentary year, was a mix of new plans, long-made pledges and a handful of held-over bills. Here is what it set out – and what it all means, politically. What is planned: There are six proposed bills intended to make the UK more competitive or otherwise free and liberal in the wake of Brexit, or tailored to post-Brexit trade deals. The flagship is the Brexit freedoms bill, which allows EU rules to be easily removed. Also planned are the procurement bill, financial services and markets bill, data reform bill, genetic technology (precision breeding) bill and trade (Australia and New Zealand) bill. Why it’s there: In part this is the sheer logistical necessity of changing regulations in the aftermath of Brexit. But the Brexit freedoms bill in particular is intended to remind voters that Boris Johnson got departure from the EU over the line, seen by the Conservatives as a key success. What is planned: There are seven bills arguably aimed, in part or whole, at stirring up the Tory base, creating headlines in friendly papers and annoying opponents. A public order bill will specifically target disruptive environmental protesters; a media bill will allow Channel 4 to be privatised; public bodies will not be allowed to boycott certain countries. Arguably the key bill would replace the Human Rights Act with a UK bill of rights. The higher education (freedom of speech) bill makes a return from the last parliament. The levelling-up bill promises local people “more of a say over changing street names”. Finally, the conversion therapy bill will ban practices aimed at changing sexuality, but not gender identity. Why it’s there: This is all part of a wider No 10-led strategy to focus on such divisive issues in the hope of shoring up support among socially conservative voters. Whether there are enough of these to win another election, if more liberal Britons become alienated, remains to be seen. What is planned: Two things: a bill setting out Downing Street’s energy security policy, and the much-touted bill to put into law the strategy for levelling up. The latter is described in fairly broad terms, with commitments including the pledge for more devolution in England and, perhaps more appealing to some voters, giving local people powers to shape planning decisions. Why it’s there: The planning element is fairly clearly aimed at wooing disillusioned Tory voters, especially in the south of England. Elsewhere, it is more of a question, some might argue, of why there is not more focus on the cost of living, even if in part this is because this is an issue which concerns day-to-day policy rather than legislation. What is planned: In legislative terms, only one thing: creating a UK infrastructure bank to “support regional and local economic growth and deliver net zero”. Why it’s there: As with the cost of living, critics might point to the lack of much else. The 140-page Queen’s speech briefing document has brief mentions of the climate emergency in terms of foreign aid, but that is otherwise it. The only mention of “insulate” is a promise to jail Insulate Britain protesters. What is planned: A higher education bill and a schools bill, setting out loans for post-18 education and a funding settlement for English schools. Why it’s there: Education is a perennial feature of Queen’s speeches. The schools funding settlement has been contentious for some time, and could bring debate. What is planned: Once again, given the housing crisis, it is a case, perhaps, of what is not said. There are planned bills to create a regulator of social housing, and a renters’ reform bill to abolish “no fault” evictions. More significant are the “blue wall”-friendly measures to allow more local input into planning. Why it’s there: There appears no consensus in government about how to build more homes, so improving the lot of renters at least does something. And planning has been a political minefield for many years. What is planned: Yet another permanent fixture of the Queen’s speech. A fair bit of the four bills this time relate to the post-Ukraine invasion world, including a national security bill bringing in “new civil measures to use as a tool of last resort where prosecution of a hostile actor is not possible”. Other bills will seek to better protect victims, and create new security rules over potential terror attacks. Why it’s there: Much of this is legislative tidying up; the flagship crime-based bill is the public order bill, seeking to further restrict protest. Critics will note there is nothing aimed at easing the backlog of cases in the judicial system. What is planned: A mixed bag of more than a dozen bills taking in areas including transport, including a plan for Great British Railways to simplify the privatised rail system and a law specifically aimed at P&O Ferries, mandating minimum employment standards for seafarers. Two bills concern Northern Ireland, and others are even more specific, such as the planned electronic trade documents bill, which puts electronic documents on the same legal basis as their paper equivalents. Why it’s there: It depends on the bill. Some, such as the rail bill, are the hobby horse of a particular minister (in this case Grant Shapps). Others simply adapt legislation for a changing world. A few, such as a bill on modern slavery and people trafficking, have been discussed and delayed for some years.",News/Politics,The Queen’s speech 2022: what was in it and what it means,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/10/the-queens-speech-2022-what-was-in-it-and-what-it-means
5/10/2022,"Dentists have warned that tens of thousands of children have been left in pain for more than a year, as new figures reveal that the number of tooth extractions for children in hospital in England more than halved during the pandemic. The number of extractions performed on decayed teeth in children aged 19 and under decreased from 35,190 in 2019-20 to 14,615 in 2020-21, data from the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities shows. The British Dental Association (BDA) said the fall in procedures, which take place in hospital under general anaesthetic, did not reflect any change in demand. Charlotte Waite, chair of the BDA’s England community dental services committee, said: “Tooth extractions among children have collapsed, but the level of demand hasn’t gone anywhere. Covid has simply left tens of thousands in pain, potentially waiting years for treatment they desperately need. “Government has yet to offer real clarity on the scale of the backlog, or a credible plan to tackle it.” The figures show that the proportion of extractions as a result of decay are virtually unchanged on levels seen a decade ago. The data also shows that children from the poorest areas are three times more likely to have extractions than those from the most affluent communities. More than 12.5m NHS dental appointments for children have been lost in England since lockdown, the BDA said, while tooth extractions have been the number one reason for hospital admissions among young children for a generation. The BDA said full disclosure was required on waiting times for hospital tooth-extraction procedures, adding that “tens of thousands of children will be left in pain, facing difficulties learning, eating and sleeping for over a year”. NHS England has previously said there are significant gaps in official data, owing to wide-ranging coding and reporting issues. An NHS report on hospital dentistry published in February 2021 stated: “We found gaps and anomalies in the collection of data through hospital episode statistics, which limits our understanding of both patient need and the people doing the work, which, in turn, affects our ability to measure outcomes, assure quality and plan the workforce we need.” The BDA joined sector leaders and the learning disability charity Mencap early in the pandemic in pressing the then health secretary, Matt Hancock, to develop an urgent action plan and commission a review into the true scale of extractions under general anaesthetic. No plan has been delivered to date, the BDA said. The Department of Health and Social Care said: “We have provided £50m to fund up to 350,000 extra NHS dental appointments and we are growing the workforce so people can get the care they need. “Dentists prioritised vulnerable groups and urgent care throughout the pandemic while continuing to provide free care to groups such as pregnant women, young people and those on low-income benefits. “We are committed to levelling up dental health across the country and through our Health and Care Act, we will make it simpler to add fluoride to water in more areas.” The Guardian has revealed that many patients in south-west England are being left in dental pain because they are unable to register for NHS care, with some so desperate that they are even resorting to DIY treatment. The charity Healthwatch in Somerset has reported that it is almost impossible for a new patient to register for an NHS dentist in the county, which is leading to adults and children living in agony, self-treating, or travelling out of the area for help.",News/Society,Hospital tooth extractions for children in England fall by over half in pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/10/hospital-tooth-extractions-children-england-nhs-dental-operations
5/10/2022,"Xavier Giannoli brings his natural force and flair to this rake’s-progress spectacular, a blue-chip French costume drama adapted from Honoré de Balzac’s 1837 novel about the poetic youth who come to the big city with provincial idealism and callow sensitivity, only to replace them with ambition, lust, corruption and (worst of all) journalism. An earlier generation might have shrugged at this as cinéma du papa, and modern audiences might smirk at the kind of decorative movie that features archly in the opening credits of Netflix’s French TV comedy Call My Agent! But it’s acted with such terrific panache that not enjoying it is impossible. Our hero is Lucien Chardon, pertly played by Benjamin Voisin (one of the lovers in François Ozon’s recent drama Summer of 85). Lucien is a humble printer’s assistant and smalltown poet, who styles himself “du Rubempré” after his well-connected mother; his handsome face and ardent verses capture the heart of local aristocrat, Louise de Bargeton (Cécile de France), with whom Benjamin is soon having an affair. A ferocious confrontation with Louise’s splutteringly cuckolded husband means that Lucien decides to make a clean break and head for Paris where, with Louise’s help, he is quite certain his poetic talent will make him the toast of the town. But his maladroit manners and absurdly misjudged new clothes embarrass Louise in front of her grand friends, including the cunning Marquise d’Espard (Jeanne Balibar) and a fashionable author who is to become Lucien’s mortal frenemy: Nathan d’Anastazio, played by that notable director and talented actor Xavier Dolan. Lucien is reduced to near-poverty, and to earn a sou, starts writing articles for the scurrilous liberal press; he is under the editorship of jeering hack Lousteau (Vincent Lacoste), and saturnine proprietor Finot (Louis-Do de Lencquesaing), who openly sell articles and good and bad reviews for cash. Lucien soon becomes a big celebrity in this nasty new trade, induces blearily cynical publisher Dauriat (Gérard Depardieu) to take his poems, and falls in love with actor Coralie (Salomé Dewaels), buying good reviews and cheering crowds for his paramour. It cannot end well. Nor does it. The metropolitan conceit and genial contempt for anything that is not for sale lends a heavy cognac flavour of glib cynicism to the story, but the film’s galloping momentum is exhilarating, and there is broad comedy in its elision of carnal desire and social ambition. Giannoli, like Balzac, invites us to see that the loss of illusions is neither entirely deliberate nor completely accidental. And it is twofold: first Lucien jettisons his flowery poetic ideals in favour of money and status; and then, painfully, throws away the delusion that this sellout was ever really going to do him any good. He admires a line in the new novel from his rival Nathan: “I now stop hoping and start living,” which is to be this story’s epitaph. And when does this moment come? When hoping turns to living? Perhaps never – or perhaps at the very start of our lives.

5/10/2022,"Female journalists have accused Scotland’s newspapers of sexist and discriminatory attitudes towards sports reporters after controversy arose over misogynist jokes at an awards dinner. Women in Journalism Scotland (WiJS) has launched a campaign calling for far greater diversity among sports reporters after it discovered that only three of Scotland’s 95 full-time sports writers were women. A study by two master’s students from the University of Strathclyde found evidence that male recruits were being paid more than women, despite having less experience, while a sports journalism course at a Scottish college had been attended by just eight women in its 13-year history; in many years its students were all male. The campaign, which is backed by the sports presenter Gabby Logan, was launched after a number of female journalists walked out of a football awards ceremony on Sunday night due to an after-dinner speaker peppering his speech with sexist, homophobic and racist remarks. The Scottish Football Writers’ Association (SFWA), which hosted the awards in Glasgow, apologised on Monday after Bill Copeland, a retired lawyer who is well known on the football after-dinner circuit, was accused of repeatedly using discriminatory language in his speech. Eilidh Barbour, a sports presenter for the BBC, Sky Sports and Amazon Prime, was among those who walked out in protest, tweeting after the event that she had “never felt so unwelcome in the industry I work in”. Gabriella Bennett, a co-chair of WiJS, said that while she and all those at her table also stood up to leave in protest, most audience members were laughing at Copeland’s remarks. Logan said: “I can’t believe I am reading all this in 2022. In 2022 there should be no barriers or discrimination to anyone who wants to enter our profession. And once there they should be made to feel welcome and encouraged to excel whoever they are.” WiJS said its members and research had identified “sexist abuse, pay disparity, macho culture, male-dominated meetings and management structures, lack of opportunity, tokenism, lack of flexibility [and] barriers to a career path” as deterrents for women entering sports journalism, and as reasons why some left the industry. Catriona MacPhee, a co-chair of WiJS, said: “This is a watershed moment for the media in Scotland. We need more women’s voices and perspectives in sports coverage and as an industry we need to work together to make sure women have access to this sector and are not pushed out,.” WiJS initiatives have included: mentoring female sports reporters – it paired five women with mentors in December; training and support resources for women at different levels in sports journalism; and improved training for women in broadcast journalism. John McLellan, director of the Scottish Newspaper Society, which represents publishers and editors, said the University of Strathclyde research had accurately identified problems for women trying to become sports journalists. He said it was in the industry’s interests to change. “While recruitment is a matter for individual companies, all publishers take their commitment to diversity, inclusion and a safe working environment very seriously and it is not in their interests to perpetuate a negative culture,” he said. “The Strathclyde university study does expose an issue with the number of women seeking to enter sports journalism, which anyone working in journalism education knows to be true. But with the higher profile of both women’s sports and female sports journalists, I’m sure this will change.” But one experienced female sports reporter, who asked not to be named, said she “did not recognise” the idea that there is a sexist, macho environment among football reporters. She agreed that work was needed to increase the number of women sports reporters, but said she had always found a supportive culture among male colleagues. “I feel very comfortable in my environment and I feel respected in my environment,” she said, adding that it was “disingenuous” to see a correlation between Copeland’s speech and the everyday experience of female football reporters. There was no “rampant misogyny” in her experience, she said. In a statement issued on Monday, the SFWA said it “apologises to anyone offended or upset by material from one of our after-dinner speakers at last night’s annual awards dinner.” Copeland’s online speaker’s biography was removed by one of the agencies that represent him, which said it supported the SFWA apology. Copeland has not yet spoken publicly about the incident.",News/Media,Female sports reporters rail against sexism at Scottish newspapers,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/10/female-sports-reporters-rail-against-sexism-at-scottish-newspapers
5/10/2022,"Can the simple joy of slapping a ball against a wall tempt shoppers and office workers to take a little more exercise? That is the question posed by British Land, one of the UK’s biggest property companies, which is trialling wallball – like squash but with hands and a single wall – which it hopes to roll out at its retail and commercial developments. Similar to the Spanish pelota and the rarefied public school game of Eton Fives, the game is being touted as a cheaper and perhaps more accessible alternative to trim trails, outdoor gyms and multi-use games area cages as planners and public health experts try to nudge Britain in a less sedentary direction. It comes as new government data shows only two-thirds of people in England are considered physically active. That is defined as doing at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week. The number falls to less than half for children and young people, according to the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities. This week, a pair of wallball courts will open against a previously blank wall at the Surrey Quays shopping centre in south-east London, replacing a car wash. Roger Madelin, the British Land executive in joint charge of the area’s £4bn, 10-year redevelopment, said walls could be added to other locations if it proved popular. British Land owns shopping centres including Meadowhall in Sheffield and office complexes including Broadgate in the City of London. “In trying to get people active on the streets I am keen to try anything,” said Madelin, who reckons the game could lure tenants in its office complexes away from their desks and attract families to shopping centres. Kate, a mother-of-four from Rotherhithe looking on at children trying out the wallball courts, welcomed the facility. “There’s not much for the kids to do here; there’s a boxing club but there’s nothing else,” she said. Teething problems last week with the special bouncy balls used for the game rolling into the shopping centre car park will be solved before opening day, the organisers said. The simple and cheap pastime (balls are available in a courtside vending machine for £2) is being championed in the UK by Daniel Grant, a keen player and NHS doctor who advocates “stealth health”: getting people more active with limited fuss. Top players are flying in this week from the US and Northern Ireland, where the game is already well established, in an effort to promote the game at a “one wall showdown” tournament under the A40 flyover in west London. They include Conor McElduff from County Tyrone who, with Luke Thomson from Gravesend and Sacha Kruithof from Spain, Grant describes as the Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic of European wallball. Jay Sanchez, a leading player from California who has competed for 37 years, will join the UK push this week. He said he found the game addictive. “Once you start playing it’s hard to stop,” he said. The first wall Grant opened in 2021, in a park near London Bridge, resulted in 1,200 balls bought in less than a year. He sees the walls as a shortcut to better health in dense towns and cities where the creation of new parks is unlikely. Research published this month showed parks in the vicinity of housing developments built later than 2000 in England and Wales are 40% smaller than those in neighbourhoods where most of the housing was built between 1930 and 1939. “They are not going to create more green space, they are just going to keep building and building so we need to use the grey space,” said Grant, looking on with pride at the latest wallball outpost in Rotherhithe. “This is what I wanted. You’re in a non-traditional sport environment, people walking past and having a go. I want this space to be an urban playground.”",News/Society,‘Once you start it’s hard to stop’: wallball trialled to get sedentary Britons active,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/10/wallball-game-trialled-london-get-sedentary-britons-active
5/10/2022,"The New York Times’s acquisition of viral word game Wordle has not been without its controversies: some players are convinced that the words have become more obscure (remember CAULK? I’m still not over it), and the solutions less satisfying. I’ve felt a vague sense of dissatisfaction with it myself since late February, though I’m not sure how much of that is a natural drop-off from the times of Wordle mania, and how much has anything to do with the game itself. This week, though, there was a genuine controversy when the NYT decided to remove the word “fetus” as a solution to one of last week’s puzzles. However, the change didn’t roll out properly, so some players got it anyway. The NYT wanted to change the solution – which would have been set way ahead of time, because Wordle’s algorithm picks from a preset list – because of the word’s sudden news relevance. We’re talking, of course, about the leaked supreme court draft that puts the US on the brink of rolling back abortion rights for millions of women. A NYT Games statement explained the technical difficulties involved in making the change, and said that the paper “[takes] our role seriously as a place to entertain and escape, and we want Wordle to remain distinct from the news.” I think it’s difficult to argue that the word “fetus” happening to show up as a Wordle solution on the day that abortion rights were back on to the news agenda constitutes a political statement. It is a coincidence. But the NYT’s attempted removal of the word absolutely is a political statement – one that says that games should have nothing to do with real life events, even accidentally. Heaven forbid that we should be made to think about foetuses on the day that we’re all reckoning with the definition of a foetus and its impact on women’s bodily autonomy, right? This is something that comes up over and over again: the hugely misguided idea that video games shouldn’t be political, because they’re supposed to be fun. But the fact is, as this incident proves, even when games are not intentionally political – even when they are “just” systems interacting with each other – they are always open to political interpretation. Games are products of our culture, and usually products of capitalism, and they do have meaning – even when the people making money from them would rather that they didn’t. Ubisoft hit the headlines a few years ago for insisting that The Division 2 – a team-based military shooting game, based on Tom Clancy fiction and literally set in Washington DC during a governmental collapse – was entirely unpolitical. This is a particularly egregious example – like the Far Cry games, which usually involve one person more-or-less single-handedly saving the populations of far-flung places from fascist dictators, The Division is hardly difficult to read politically. Shooters in general, by the very nature of their systems, involve righting the wrongs of a world by exerting violence upon it. They are the product of a particular culture and worldview, and acknowledging that shouldn’t undermine anyone’s enjoyment of them. It can be hugely interesting when games do engage with the usually unspoken politics of the medium, or even try to critique them. 2008’s Far Cry 2 – still the most subversive shooter I’ve ever played – has you engaged in a crushingly pointless and attritional war in a fictional African country, and I don’t think it’s a spoiler to say that nobody comes out of it well (least of all the player). Not every game has to have capital-P Politics, but creators shouldn’t fear it. Fear of appearing political can hold creativity back and lead to weird decisions and prevarications that end up pleasing nobody. And as Wordle has just proven, even the most seemingly innocuous game can suddenly become a political talking point if circumstances align. Better to embrace the possibility. I can’t talk about politics in games without talking about the hugely conflicted, endearing mess that is Watch Dogs: Legion, a game that I possibly liked more than anybody else anywhere. I’m not recommending it unreservedly – it is, as mentioned, a bit of a mess, with a cartoonishly nasty and misanthropic story that rather undermines the fun – but it’s just so interesting. You play as a team of insurgents in a fascist London, rising up against the quasi-military and technocratic institutions that rule the UK in the place of just government – and I really do mean a team, as you can recruit and play as anyone in the whole of London. It’s this feature, not the story or the missions or anything else, that makes it essentially a game about the power and the limitations of both violent resistance and collective action. A great illustration of how game systems can end up creating all kinds of interesting situations that were never intended.

Her question: which games do you enjoy sitting and watching someone else play? I am a notorious backseat gamer – just ask my partner, who has suffered for 13 years. I’m drastically impatient. Watching him play almost any video game is a stressful experience for everyone involved. The exception? Point-and-click adventures, and similar games that involve a sedate pace, jokes and stories, and puzzle-solving. Because these games are slow by default, and honestly pretty much the same to watch as to play yourself, it’s impossible for him to move too slowly for me, and I don’t get too frustrated with the lack of action. If I’m sitting there reading a book or poking at my phone while he plays, I don’t miss anything crucial.

5/10/2022,"So, this is how our civil rights end, eh? Not with a bang but with a lot of people whimpering about “civility”. Last week, the US was rocked by the leak of a draft supreme court opinion signalling the court is ready to overturn Roe v Wade. Outrage quickly mounted – but not everyone was outraged by quite the same things. While some people were upset that five out of nine unelected judges (two of whom have been accused of sexual misconduct) have the power to take away women’s bodily autonomy, CNN’s legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin (who reportedly exposed himself on Zoom) had a meltdown over the impropriety of the leak itself. “The idea that a decision of this magnitude could leak is really a shattering experience for the justices and the court,” he told viewers, breathlessly. “I really don’t know how or if the institution is going to recover.” Shattering for the justices? He doesn’t know if the institution is going to recover? Talk about missing the damn point. Uh-oh! I apologise to anyone who may have been offended by my use of the D-word. Naughty me: it seems I haven’t absorbed one of the big lessons of the past week. Which is this: when your civil rights are in danger, the most important thing you can do in response is Be Civil. If five unelected judges decide that you have no control over your uterus and no right to privacy, that’s just democracy in action, my friends. If, on the other hand, you decide you want to respond to the dismantling of your civil rights by protesting outside the houses of the judges responsible, then shame on you! How dare you violate these people’s privacy! I wish I was exaggerating here, but it seems that large swathes of the US have decided the most outrageous thing that has happened in the past week is that some of the peaceful protests sparked by the leaked Roe v Wade opinion have taken place outside the homes of the conservative judges involved. The Washington Post’s editorial board, for example, preached that everyone should “leave the justices alone at home”. Prominent conservatives, such as Bill Kristol, tweeted things such as: “Please don’t protest at people’s homes … Organize politically, be civil civically.” And the White House issued a statement about how judges must “be able to do their jobs without concern for their personal safety” that was interpreted by many as a condemnation of the protests. It’s reasonable to argue that protests outside officials’ houses aren’t appropriate. What I object to is the cynical way in which “civility” is constantly weaponised, the way it has become a sneaky byword for “servility” – a way to tell people to shut up and accept the status quo. Arguments for “civility” certainly aren’t used with much consistency: many of the people clutching their pearls about the protests making judges’ personal lives “miserable” (as the Washington Post put it) don’t seem to be quite so bothered about how miserable it might be for a woman to be forced to give birth. And I don’t think there was much discussion of “civility” when, in 2014, the supreme court struck down a Massachusetts law that mandated a 35-foot buffer zone around clinics that provide abortion services. The court found that it was unconstitutional for protesters not to have to the right to get in the faces of vulnerable people who were just trying to access healthcare. If protesters want to protest in front of a judge’s house though? Uncivil! I am all for civility, of course I am. Here’s the thing though: civil rights have never been won by grovelling at the feet of people who hate you and saying, ‘Please sir, can I have a few more rights?’ You simply do not owe civility to people who don’t see you as a full citizen. It’s worrying how many people seem to think otherwise. If you want a picture of the future, based on the past week, imagine a boot stamping on a human face for ever – and telling you to say please and thank you while it does so.

5/10/2022,"This at times extraordinary concert marked the start of what remains of Andris Nelsons’ Strauss Project, planned as a major survey of the composer’s works shared between Nelsons’ two orchestras, the Leipzig Gewandhaus and the Boston Symphony. In the event, however, the Bostonians cancelled the European tour of which their concerts formed part, so only the two Gewandhaus performances – this was the first – went ahead as intended. The programme consisted of Macbeth, Ein Heldenleben and the rather awkward Suite of highlights from Der Rosenkavalier, assembled in 1945 by the conductor Artur Rodzinski, and even though one might have occasional qualms about Nelsons’ interpretative choices, what was indisputable was the greatness of the orchestra itself, among the finest in the world, and the quality of their playing. Their clear, opulent sound is ideally suited to Nelsons’ fastidious yet volatile approach to Strauss, where detail is paramount, even when the music is at its loudest. We were able to appreciate, for instance, the internal logic of the battle sequence of Heldenleben, rather than simply enduring the incoherent racket we frequently encounter. Elsewhere, there were moments of quite remarkable beauty: even without the voices, the Presentation of the Rose has rarely, I suspect, sounded so exquisite; and the hushed coda of Heldenleben was breathtaking. Occasionally, however, Nelsons’ emphasis on finesse and textural detail came at the expense of drama. This is not to say, by any means, that he lacked insight, far from it: the sense of noble self-assurance, free from arrogance or bombast, that he brought to the Heldenleben recapitulation was thrilling and startlingly novel. But in Macbeth, particularly, the tensions sometimes slipped. Prophetic of the intensity of Salome and Elektra, this is Strauss’s first psychodrama, and it should ideally inhabit similar extremes. But once past an electrifying opening, the sinewy flutes and jolting syncopations that herald both Lady Macbeth’s first appearance and her later instability sounded altogether too polite. The performance subsequently took time to regain momentum, and the climactic battering at the castle gate was less terrifying than it should be. Orchestrally it was tremendous, but its impact could have been more nerve-racking than it was.",Arts/Music,Leipzig Gewandhaus/Nelsons review – exquisite and thrilling Strauss from a great orchestra,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/10/gewandhaus-orchester-leipzig-nelsons-strauss-review-barbican-london
5/10/2022,"Big high street pharmacy chains including Boots and Superdrug have run out of some hay fever medicines, with the manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline, blaming temporary supply issues. Piriton and Piriteze tablets, made by GSK, are out of stock at Boots and other chains because there is an industry-wide shortage of the active ingredient, chlorphenamine maleate, which is also used to treat eczema and food allergies. The products are expected to be back on shelves within the next few weeks, according to the industry. GSK said its Piriteze allergy syrup, which is given to children, was not affected by the problems. A GSK spokesperson said: “Due to the reduced availability of certain active ingredients across the industry, we can confirm GSK consumer healthcare is experiencing temporary supply shortages of Piriton and Piriteze tablets. We appreciate that the demand for these medicines will be high over the coming months and are working hard to improve availability as soon as possible.” Hay fever is caused by tree, grass and other pollen, and levels are expected to be high in coming days, according to the Met Office. Boots said only four of its 90 hay fever relief products were affected by the shortages – Piriton tablets and its own-brand version, both sold in different pack sizes. These antihistamines cause drowsiness, so many people prefer other medicines. A Boots spokesperson said: “At Boots we have a large range of hay fever relief medicines, with good availability of stock overall in our stores and online. There are a very small number of lines that are currently out of stock due to a current, industry-wide shortage of the active ingredient. “However, we are expecting this to be resolved soon and new deliveries are expected in the coming weeks.” Superdrug said it was experiencing shortages of two products, Piriton 30s and 60s tablets packs, but it had many alternatives such as its own-brand allergy ranges with the active ingredients loratadine or cetirizine, and another medicine, Allevia. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society said there was no reason to be alarmed at the shortages, as there was plentiful supply of other hay fever medicines. Its president, Claire Anderson, said: “Chlorphenamine maleate is just one component of a few hay fever tablets, including Piriton, which is not a first line choice for treating hay fever for adults as it is more likely to make patients drowsy. Other medication using cetirizine hydrochloride or loratadine is still available widely in pharmacies across the country, and fexofenadine is also now available on general sale at pharmacies this year for the first time, so patients actually have more options than ever to treat their hay fever symptoms.” She said medicines shortages were not a new problem, and were something pharmacists had to manage and deal with on a daily basis. There can be a multitude of reasons, including manufacturing issues, global demand or disruption with the supply chain. “Availability of certain medicines fluctuates, and it is important to ask your pharmacist for alternatives,” she said. “GPs, pharmacists and patient groups have called for pharmacists to be able to make minor changes to a prescription when something is out of stock – this should be considered as part of a package of measures to address future medicines supplies.” A spokesperson for the society said the situation was different from the hormone replacement therapy (HRT) crisis, which began a couple of years ago and was caused by longer-term issues, rather than temporary supply fluctuations. Unlike hay fever medicines, there are far fewer HRT products on the market. Last week, the UK health secretary promised to deploy more members of the vaccine taskforce to a new group set up to fix the acute shortage of HRT products for menopausal women, after holding crisis talks with HRT manufacturers and pharmacies. The new HRT team is headed by Madelaine McTernan, who also runs the vaccine taskforce. The months of supply shortages mean many menopausal women are struggling to sleep or work effectively because they are unable to obtain their prescriptions.",News/Business,"Boots, Superdrug and other chemists report hay fever pill shortages",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/10/boots-superdrug-hay-fever-pill-shortages-piriton-piriteze-tablets
5/10/2022,"Boris Johnson has pledged to ensure local people benefit from new housing developments and promised to overhaul human rights law, in a Queen’s speech designed to woo back disenchanted Conservative voters. Standing in for the Queen, Prince Charles announced plans for 38 new laws including a levelling-up bill giving local leaders powers to tackle decaying high streets. Local people will be given powers to shape planning decisions, in a pared-back set of changes aimed at avoiding the risk of infuriating voters in Tory heartlands by unleashing a building boom. A levelling-up and regeneration bill will introduce a “locally set, non-negotiable levy” paid by developers, to deliver infrastructure such as schools and new roads. Among other new laws will be a Brexit bill designed to make it easier to adapt carried-over EU legislation – as well as promised legislation to tackle the widely criticised actions of P&O Ferries to undermine minimum-wage law. The law will give ports powers to refuse access to ferry services that do not pay an equivalent to the national minimum wage to seafarers while in UK waters. Two key new bills will revive long-delayed plans first proposed by Theresa May to ban “no fault” section 21 evictions for tenants, though the bill also pledges to strengthen landlords’ rights of possession, introducing new and stronger grounds for repeated incidences of rent arrears and reducing notice periods for antisocial behaviour. There will also be a social housing regulation bill designed to tackle rogue landlords. There were few new measures in the speech to address the cost of living crisis directly – though the accompanying press releases list the measures the government has already taken, including the temporary energy bill rebate. Johnson said the country had “risen to challenges with no precedent in recent history” including the Covid-19 pandemic and vaccine rollout, as well as Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, the UK’s supply of weapons to Kyiv and the sanctions regime that had been imposed. But he warned that “economic aftershocks” of global crises meant huge disruptions to the global economy. “No country is immune and no government can realistically shield everyone from the impact,” he said. The speech contained very limited further measures to help with rising costs of living. Johnson warned in his introduction to the speech there would be a price for further intervention to help with the cost of living crisis. He said: “Every pound of taxpayer’s money we spend on reducing bills now, it is a pound we are not investing in bringing down bills and prices over the longer term. “And that, if anything, this moment makes clear our best remedy lies in urgently delivering on our mission to turbo-charge the economy, create jobs and spread opportunity across the country.” Johnson said the speech’s priority was “growing the economy, safer streets and supporting the NHS to clear the Covid-19 backlogs”. But the Queen’s speech also includes significant scope for the government to pursue “wedge issues”, including constraints on legal challenges and a new British bill of rights intended to replace the Human Rights Act. A boycott, divestment and sanctions bill will prevent public authorities, such as councils, adopting their own boycott policies against countries they disagree with. The proposed bill of rights will “ensure there is a proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security and effective government, strengthening freedom of speech”, the speech said. There will also be a bill to ban gay and lesbian conversion therapy, which controversially will not extend to trans people. A bill is also proposed to begin the process of selling Channel 4. In a move to reinstate measures thrown out by the House of Lords in January, the government will announce new offences to stop protesters from “locking on” to infrastructure, extend stop and search powers, and make it illegal to obstruct transport projects. The public order bill will be aimed at quashing tactics employed by protest groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil. The Treasury will also introduce a new financial services and markets bill, reforming City regulation to “ensure a greater focus on growth and international competitiveness”. Rishi Sunak wants the UK to be a pioneer in new areas such as cryptocurrency, but he may face questions about whether he is pursuing a Singapore-on-Thames style deregulation that could jeopardise financial stability. A transport bill will create a new accountability body, Great British Railways, which will have contracting powers for passenger services, with goals and budgets set by government.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson tries to woo Tory voters with planning powers in Queen’s speech,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/10/boris-johnson-tries-to-woo-tory-voters-with-planning-powers-in-queens-speech
