3/14/2022,"Most of us know the positive benefits spending time in nature can bring, but for many, it’s sadly not feasible or realistic day-to-day. Whether it’s due to disability, a lack of time or the absence of nearby green space for those in flats or without gardens, many people are bereft of the nourishment a daily slice of nature provides. IKEA’s Life at Home report 2021 showed that access to a private garden or green space has grown dramatically in importance over the last year when people reflect upon their ideal home, with 53% of people in the UK agreeing it has become increasingly important to them. In fact, the UK is one of the countries where this has grown the most in importance. Good news then, that clever solutions are at hand to help everyone enjoy the benefits of bringing the outdoors indoors. Walk down IKEA’s plants aisle and you’ll see greenery in a range of shapes, sizes and textures – from tall and willowy to small and cute – that will suit every interior. The retailer is on a mission to help us make our homes into havens that fulfil all the functions we need, and plants are part of that process. Did you know that even gazing at indoor plants has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety? As well as bringing psychological and physiological benefits, introducing greenery into our homes can help in other, more practical and functional ways, too. Like allowing us to create the illusion of space, privacy, light and colour in spaces that might not ordinarily allow it. This could prove especially helpful now, given that over the past two years our homes and mental wellbeing have become more intimately connected than ever before. Indeed, IKEA research found that nearly a quarter of Brits don’t feel their home is a “sanctuary”, a concept that IKEA identifies as having three central pillars: rooms should function well, have a feeling of space and promote a sense of calm and happiness (AKA emotional stability). Here’s how to reclaim your very own sanctuary, with the help of a little greenery … Use plants to ‘zone’ your living spaceEver thought about “zoning”? Plants can help create a sense of purpose or privacy by sectioning off or opening up certain areas and allowing them to function effectively. Feel overlooked by neighbours or housemates? Towering plants such as money trees, snake plants or bamboo palms placed by windows or on balconies will help screen you. And use plant-laden bookcases and shelving units, such as the IKEA Kallax or Billy, to section off workstations and disguise unruly clutter (they should help muffle noise, too). Seek out natural materialsNatural textures and materials are an easy but subtle way to bring the feeling of the outdoors in and promote emotional stability, without bankrupting yourself on plants alone. Try mimicking outdoor scenes with rustic materials and textures such as stone, wood, bamboo, glass and rattan – even antique or distressed mirrors can bring about that magical greenhouse feel indoors. Dried flowers and grasses are another interiors trend showing no sign of slowing down – from bunny tails to pampas grass and dried pussy willow, they’re a simple way of adding texture and interesting detail to a room without the maintenance of living plants. Flower walls aren’t just for InstagramSmall space? No problem. Take your cue from vertical gardens, which are having something of a moment in the horticultural world, and create your own indoor version to avoid using up precious floor space and allowing rooms to function properly. “You can make a real statement with a vertical garden in your home,” says Marie Tenglund, IKEA’s UK interior design leader. “They are perfect for smaller spaces and with the Fejka range, you don’t even need to water your plants.” IKEA’s Fejka is a clever wall-mounted artificial plant panel (choose as many as you like to liven up plain spaces), giving you maximum effect for minimum effort. Or pick tall, slim plants like the corn plant in streamlined pots to really draw the eye up and give the illusion of space. Likewise, IKEA’s Satsumas vertical plant stand houses five pots at varying levels – dot your most-loved plants, books and accessories on it for a relaxed, eclectic feel. Resist perfectionismThe joy of bringing greenery into the home is that it can be messy in a good way – you don’t need to stage plants or flowers meticulously to enjoy the mental health benefits. Create your own delightfully chaotic urban jungle by mixing plants of different heights and sizes in different pots and containers, mixing larger, leafier ones with smaller, sturdier offerings dotted around the place. And if space really is in short supply, recreate the idea on walls instead, framing your favourite pressed or dried flowers in IKEA’s Lerboda or Edsbruk frames, or dotting Kapkrusbar hanging planters from each room’s highest points, like windows or beams. Embrace the scent of naturePicture your favourite beach, forest or hiking trail and chances are, you can practically smell it. To truly bring the outside in and invoke that spacious feeling of the great outdoors, try introducing some of your best-loved “outdoorsy” fragrances. “Home fragrance adds a sense of comfort and luxury to your surroundings,” says Tenglund. “It can help set the tone, and affect your mood positively which can benefit your wellbeing.” Soak up some hygge-inspired downtime by lighting IKEA’s Ringlad fresh mint candles, for example, or a Valdoft morning dew candle (and repurpose the glass jar with your latest plant addition when burned). And don’t overlook the power of natural scents, either – it’s amazing where a few sprigs of rosemary or a couple of drops of lemon oil can take you (Sicily, anyone?). Create an indoor gardenWhen thinking about the “ideal home”, IKEA’s Life at Home report has highlighted how access to a garden has grown in importance for 53% of people surveyed in the UK. But even if having your own outdoor space feels like a pipe dream, windowsill herb gardens or space-saving indoor gardens, such as the Socker decorative indoor greenhouse, are a practical way to beckon in the cheer of green without feeling overwhelmed, promoting feelings of emotional stability and calm. Likewise, small succulents housed in IKEA’s Chiafron pots, or pretty plant cuttings in tumblers, give a cheerful nod to greenery without the faff of too much work. Arm yourself with the right toolsBefore purchasing any plants, it’s important to do your research – some fare better in certain conditions than others, tolerating things like low light or wet bathrooms much more easily. And as any green-fingered type knows, overwatering can prove almost as disastrous as forgetting to water at all. Keep a water spritz bottle such as the trusty IKEA Sesamfron somewhere you’re likely to stumble upon it, like next to ferns, aloe vera or orchids (all of which benefit from regular spritzing). Add the Chilipulver plant-watering sensor to your shopping basket (it gives you a heads up when watering is overdue), and you should be good to go. Fake it till you make itIf tending for plants really isn’t your bag, don’t deprive yourself of the aesthetically-pleasing result – fake it instead. Fejka artificial potted plants require zero upkeep but promise to brighten up even the saddest-looking of spaces, bringing a much-needed splash of colour and warmth to your home’s every nook. They’re helpful if tight on space too, since that artificial cheese plant won’t get any bigger! Hang artificial asparagus plants in the kitchen above cookbooks for a rustic homely feel or stand faux lavender in the bedroom, with incredibly realistic-looking Smycka eucalyptus in the bathroom. Nobody need ever know … Bringing the outside in using plants and greenery can transform your home from a place where you live to a sanctuary – a vibrant, well-organised space that gives you a sense of safety and happiness, a place where you can relax away from the world. Going green is just one of the many ways to make sure your home is your sanctuary.

3/14/2022,"A judge has jailed a woman for the part she played in last year’s Bristol riot despite hearing she had mental health issues and had run out of medication. Jasmine York, 26, was given a nine month sentence for pushing a bin into a burning police car during the disturbance, which followed a “kill the bill” protest. York, who was struck by police batons and bitten by a police dog, was cleared by a jury of the more serious charge of riot but convicted of arson. During a sentencing hearing on Monday, Bristol crown court heard York, from Brislington, Bristol, had been diagnosed with emotional unstable personality disorder and had long-standing issues with drugs and alcohol. Her barrister, Russell Fraser, said she regretted what she had done and asked for her sentence to be suspended. But Judge James Patrick said he would be failing in his public duty if he did not impose an immediate custodial sentence. He highlighted that after pushing the bin at a police vehicle she warned: “We will burn your fucking cars.” The judge told York: “You played your part in continuing the lawlessness. Your actions made a difficult situation even worse. There is no issue that you didn’t know what you were doing. “Your offending played a part in a very serious incident and caused very serious damage to public and private property and was very difficult to police.” York is the 15th person to be convicted over the trouble, which took place outside Bridewell police station, on 21 March 2021. Those found guilty have been jailed for a total of almost 60 years. Avon and Somerset police were criticised by some activists at this riot and subsequent “kill the bill” demonstrations for what they saw as heavy-handed tactics with horses and dogs being used to disperse protesters.",News/UK news,Woman jailed over role in Bristol riot despite mental health issues,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/14/woman-jailed-over-role-in-bristol-riot-despite-mental-health-issues
3/14/2022,"The first thing I realise as I pour my curves into my hired tux ahead of my night at the Baftas is that I don’t have any shoes. No one had mentioned appropriate dress shoes to me at Moss Bros, so I ended up donning a pair of Dr Martens which had been gathering dust under my wardrobe. I feel like a variation of that meme: “When you’ve got the Baftas at 5pm but a Machine Gun Kelly club night in Camden at 10pm.” Also, suits don’t quite work on my lanky frame: I look like a scarecrow dressed as a slightly rebellious waiter. Later, as I check my invite for the millionth time another realisation hits me: nearly every aspect of the evening will involve champagne. Not to demystify the glamour of it all so early on, but champagne brings on my acid reflux. I imagine myself gagging in front of Benedict Cumberbatch (insert a Rebel Wilson-style cheeky wink here). After 2021’s low-key Zoom-based awards, everything about this year’s full-capacity ceremony is dialled back up to Fabulous. The red carpet – Europe’s longest, flooring fans – is properly bright. The lights, while unnecessary given that the ceremony’s earlier-than-normal start means it’s still daytime, are retina-burning. Fans are back, too. On arrival at the Royal Albert Hall I clomp up the lightly watered red carpet walkway the wrong way, spying a gaggle of Benedict Cumberbatch disciples. One man, seemingly having drifted in from the set of Portrait Artist of the Year, clasps a sketchpad featuring a delicate pencil drawing of his idol. Next to him a Florence Pugh T-shirt is draped over the advertising hoardings ready to be scrawled over. Anyone that walks past who isn’t Cumberbatch, Pugh or even tangentially linked to the Marvel universe is given short shrift. Getting inside takes time. There are queues of extended-arm selfie-takers and people posing in front of gigantic Bafta faces. At one point the red carpet splits; on one side go the famous people to have their photos taken by professionals, and on the other go the normal people to have strangers take blurry pics on iPhones. Once inside though, there’s calm. Too much calm. The stage is empty, as are all the seats. In fact, they’re still rehearsing; at one point Florence Pugh walks on to practise swishing her long pink tulle dress so that it settles behind her in exactly the right place. I examine my box (Rebel Wilson face) and there it is, a huge bottle of champagne, my very own sparkling kryptonite. I settle for still water in a champagne flute (fancy!) and instantly regret not having some crisps before I left. Dinner is at least six hours away. Luckily a nice man from the Independent shares his bag of Nibbly Fingers with me as we watch sparkly dresses take their seats. Lady Gaga – nominated for best actress in extended Dolmio advert House of Gucci – arrives in 10 feet of green satin. She’s by far the starriest, most properly famous person in the room; famous enough to get up and have a wander around despite the show literally being about to start. It’s hard to tell from our vantage point how she feels about her 2020 classic Rain on Me being played over the PA, or indeed how everyone feels about Miley Cyrus’s Party in the USA seemingly being stuck on a loop. The vibe is cordial, pre-wedding ceremony static. By the time the show begins, following a quick run-through of the rules – no filming (us), no long speeches (the winners), no swearing (us and the winners) – my body is just about willing but my mind is wavering. Cue Shirley Bassey arriving sheathed in silver tinsel singing her lungs out under a giant disco ball to celebrate 60 years of Bond. I’m back in the room. When Bassey extends her arms up towards the disco ball it looks like she’s returning to the mothership, in a scene from a sci-fi film I’m keen to pitch to the producers of Dune. Gaga loves it (Bassey, that is). So do I. I start to home in on Gaga, mimicking her reactions. If a joke lands (host Rebel Wilson going off script to tell Lionsgate to go fuck themselves for scrapping her film, for example), she does two quick claps and rocks forward slightly. When her House of Gucci co-star Salma Hayek arrives on stage to present an award she waves enthusiastically just in case Hayek doesn’t recognise her. When she doesn’t win for best actress she’s the only person who gives gobsmacked winner Joanna Scanlan a standing ovation. Note to producers: next time Gaga deserts pop for film we need a fan cam trained just on her, thank you. What else can I tell you about a televised event that’s also been dissected on Twitter? In the room, most of Wilson’s jokes get a throaty cackle. Starved of any real entertainment – people slowly getting up out of their chairs to walk up some steps to thank their families wears thin after three hours – the general consensus seems to be that things pick up whenever she’s around. Sure the endless mentions of how bad Cats was feel played out, as does the over reliance on the Dune sandworm, but who doesn’t love some bawdy jokes about riding Tom Hiddleston? Glittering, glamorous ceremony over we are quickly herded towards a fleet of limos. And by limos I mean coaches. “It’s like a school trip,” laughs a lady draped in a pashmina headed to the back of the bus. Like on every school trip music starts blaring out of someone’s phone (Gaga’s 2009 classic Poker Face is played twice), but unlike one specific school trip I was on, no one vomits a mix of chocolate and Coke into a zip-lock sandwich bag. At the Grosvenor Hotel, where dinner will finally be served, I hunt for my table. I hunt some more. I sit down, gnaw on a breadstick and await my leek tart followed by a deconstructed apple tart. I politely turn down some more champagne. If you’re thinking “who stays sober at an awards ceremony?” then fear not because the incredibly patient waiting staff essentially give me a bottle of red wine to myself. The mix of pinot noir with the puce pink cocktails I vaguely remember “enjoying” at the not at all star-studded afterparty (the actors had all gone to Chiltern Firehouse for the Netflix party by that point) mean I quickly become one of those people so unused to being anywhere fancy that they turn feral and start stealing. You see, each table features a ludicrous centrepiece representing either Dune, Don’t Look Up, Belfast, The Power of the Dog or Licorice Pizza. While the Power of the Dog one was the prettiest – some huge delicately crafted paper roses – the Don’t Look Up one had the best swag, including an actual skateboard amid some far less useful ephemera. Suffice to say I spent the taxi ride home cradling a cardboard cutout of the black Birkin bag beloved of Jonah Hill’s Don’t Look Up character. It was the first thing I saw the morning after. In hindsight, perhaps it’s time to give champagne another go, reflux be damned.

3/14/2022,"The Northern Ireland protocol of Brexit is not “simple or straightforward” but it is lawful, a court of appeal has ruled. Lord chief justice Dame Siobhan Keegan, along with two other judges in the Belfast court, concluded that the protocol had not illegally trumped the Acts of Union 1800, which established Northern Ireland’s place in the UK, or elements of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which followed the peace deal that year. They were considering complicated matters relating to the constitutionality of the protocol, following a high court judgment in a case brought by a group of unionist politicians including Jim Allister, the head of the Traditional Unionist Voice party. Others involved in the case were Brexit supporter Ben Habib, former Labour MP Kate Hoey and Clifford Peeples, a member of the public. In dismissing five grounds of appeal, the court of appeal found that the government had acted lawfully, that international treaties were not a devolved matter and that decisions made by a democratically elected national government did not bind future governments centuries or decades later to their decisions. Peeples’ lawyer, Ciaran O’Hare, said they would now consider whether to take a further appeal to the supreme court, as it raised unprecedented matters about the intersection of law and the unwritten constitution. “What we say is there is a hierarchy of constitutional statutes and the Acts of Union, which established Northern Ireland, sits at the top of that hierarchy. This concept of a hierarchy of laws has never been litigated before. It was touched upon in the case over HS2 [the high-speed train service in England], but it was not fully scrutinised,” said O’Hare, of McIvor Farrell. Keegan said she and two other judges agreed with the argument that “an overly literal interpretation” of laws made in the 1800s does not require “complete parity” with new laws governing trade between Great Britain and Ireland. It concluded that the phrasing of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 did not impliedly repeal the Acts of Union as suggested by the high court. “The question arises whether this is an effective repeal of article six of the Acts of Union, we cannot see that it is, in strict terms. That is due to the fact that the protocol is not codified as a permanent solution and is drafted in flexible terms,” the judgment said. It added that the later statute “takes precedence” and “this aligns with the core tenets of parliamentary sovereignty … including the principle that parliament cannot bind its successors”. She told the court that it was right that the case was expedited through the courts as “the protocol has generated much debate and reaction” and discussion over constitutional issues. But she concluded that the act of parliament that led to Brexit was the “result of a protracted, transparent, debated, informed and fully democratic process which decided arrangements for Northern Ireland post Brexit”. She said it “cannot be seriously suggested that parliament was unaware of the changes that may be wrought” and “there can be no doubt in relation to parliamentary intention in this case”. The ruling comes as the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has reportedly set out plans to put a row between the UK and the EU over the protocol on hold because of the Ukraine crisis and more urgent efforts between the bloc and London to push for peace. According to the Sunday Telegraph, she has written to Boris Johnson suggesting the plan to trigger article 16 over the protocol should be parked, and proposing an interim deal involving a “green lane” for goods traded between Great Britain and Northern Ireland only.",News/UK news,"Northern Ireland protocol is lawful, court of appeal rules",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/14/northern-ireland-protocol-is-lawful-court-of-appeal-rules
3/14/2022,"There was a solemn mood on the Instagram stories of Russia’s influenceri over the weekend, as they prepared to be disconnected from the social media app. “This [Instagram] is my life, this is my soul. This is what I have been waking up to and falling asleep with for the last five years,” said the fashion blogger Karina Nigay, who boasts nearly 3 million followers, through tears. “I’m in a state of resentment and nowhere near a state of acceptance.” Russian prosecutors demanded on Friday that access to Instagram be blocked after the app’s parent company, Meta, confirmed it was relaxing its policies on hate speech towards Russian soldiers and Vladimir Putin within certain countries in relation to the country’s war in Ukraine. By Monday morning Instagram – the most popular social media platform among young Russians – was no longer accessible. Karina Istomina, a popular DJ and Instagram influencer with more than 400,000 followers, said: “Roughly half of all my income came through Instagram advertising. To be honest with you, I am absolutely devastated that I am losing my page. I ran my profile for over 10 years. Most likely I will have to find new sources of income, will have to rediscover myself.” The move to block Instagram came as the app had emerged as one of the last platforms for Russians to voice their opposition to the invasion of Ukraine, with Russian artists, bloggers and athletes using the social network to speak out against the war. Russia had already launched an unprecedented crackdown on independent media and anti-war dissent after the country’s invasion of Ukraine. Moscow had already blocked access to Facebook and Twitter earlier this month before Meta’s designation as an “extremist organisation”, accusing the two platforms of violating the “rights and freedoms of Russian nationals”. Russian regulators said the messaging service WhatsApp, which is also owned by Meta, will not be impacted as it is “a means of communication, not a source of information”. “Putin has invaded a sovereign nation and is waging a war there … It is clear that Putin does not care about people for a long time now,” wrote Yuri Dudt, one of Russia’s most popular media personalities, in a widely shared post days after the invasion that has received more than 1.5m likes. But for many small and medium-sized Russian businesses, Instagram was also a leading platform for advertising, organising sales and communicating with clients, and the move to block the app will likely further undermine the business climate in the country. “Instagram became our house, our bridge with the outside world,” said Dilyara Minrakhmanova, who runs the clothing brand Outlaw in Moscow. “Since our inception seven years ago, we managed to bring together a large community of like-minded thinkers. “It pains to think that we will lose that all,” Minrakhmanov said, adding 96% of all her social media traffic was linked to Meta apps. Many influencers and businesses like Outlaw on Sunday were posting links to their Telegram and VKontakte channels, two Russian-founded platforms that will welcome the influx of new users. Telegram, which says it prioritises users’ privacy and security, was founded by the Russian self-described libertarian Pavel Durov in 2013 and maintains a hands-off moderating philosophy. Durov, who previously founded VKontakte, Russia’s biggest social network, left the country for Dubai after being pushed out under government pressure. With many Kremlin critics now moving to Telegram, experts say the messaging app might soon also be blocked or seized by the Kremlin. “I do not quite understand why Telegram has not been banned. One explanation could be that the Kremlin thinks it can use Telegram for their own propaganda purposes,” said Andrei Soldatov, a Russian technology analyst and censorship expert. Telegram has emerged as an information battleground during the conflict, with pro-Kremlin channels sharing the country’s supposed military successes, while Ukrainian officials have turned to the app to publish videos and photos showing captured Russian troops. “With the way things are going at the moment in Russia, I don’t think the app can exist in this form for much longer,” Soldatov said. Durov has so far vouched to keep the app independent and told Ukrainian users their data is safe. “I stand for our users no matter what. Their right to privacy is sacred – now more than ever,” he wrote last week. Russia moved to restrict access to Telegram in 2018 but lifted the ban two years later after failing to thwart the operations of the widely used messaging app. Nevertheless, Kremlin critics have recently accused the app of bowing down to the authorities after it blocked a bot that told supporters of the jailed opposition figure Alexei Navalny which candidate they should back to unseat Kremlin-aligned politicians during the 2021 September parliamentary election. The government-controlled Russian Direct Investment has also invested in the messaging app. On Sunday, as some people were busy setting up new channels on Telegram, others said they were not yet ready to let go of Instagram, seeking ways to evade the social media ban. Internet searches for VPN services in the country almost doubled over the last week compared with the previous week, according to Top10VPN, a UK company that researches and recommends private network services. Tanya Mingalimova, a blogger with more than 250,000 Instagram followers, wrote on Sunday afternoon: “My plans for the evening are to grab dinner and then install a VPN.”",News/Technology,‘This is my life’: Russian influencers take stock after Instagram access blocked,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/14/russian-influencers-instagram-access-blocked-telegram-social-media
3/14/2022,"If any British racing fans had convinced themselves last year’s Cheltenham Festival was an aberration, that this year’s meeting might see British horses summoning up at least a little more resistance to their opponents from Ireland, then Saturday’s Imperial Cup result at Sandown was a shock to the system of ice-bucket challenge proportions. On paper, it was one of the most tightly handicapped fields of the season: 21 runners from Britain gainst a sole challenger from Ireland – which proceeded to win with such ridiculous ease that another stone on its back would have made little difference. That it was called Surprise Package only added to the sense that Irish racing has started trolling its British counterpart. Even a decade ago, Ireland’s 23-5 romp through the 2021 Festival was unthinkable. It was all but unthinkable as they went to the start for the opening race 12 months ago. Paddy Power, never a firm to shy away from a patriotic price or two, chalked up “20 or more” at 9-1 and went no further than that. The final result was a rugby score – if the match in question was Ireland v Italy. In hindsight, though, it was only the scale of Ireland’s superiority that came as any real surprise. The fact of it was almost a given. Britain’s jump-racing industry is much bigger and richer than Ireland’s in terms of horse population, total prize money and the number of races during the season. It has also historically fielded the majority of runners at the Cheltenham Festival: it is supposed to be a “home” fixture, after all. But in recent years, Ireland’s progress at National Hunt’s showpiece meeting has been relentless. As recently as 2013 Irish trainers saddled more Festival winners than the British for the first time. After the late 80s, Festivals when the visitors were relieved to get a single winner on the board, it was quite the turnaround. The next two meetings went Britain’s way – by 15-12 and 14-13 – but the home team has not won the so-called Prestbury Cup outright since. The aggregate score over the past six Festivals is 105 to 62 in Ireland’s favour. All’s fair in love and bookie-bashing and so the extent to which any of this matters to the average punter is debatable. Racing is not a team sport and at ground levelthe rivalry, such as it is, is as friendly and sporting as they get. Many of the great Festival favourites and winning gambles in recent years have been trained in Ireland and Rachael Blackmore’s historic achievement in becoming the first female jockey to win the top-jockey prize last season was the icing on the cake. A little flag-waving on the way back to the winner’s enclosure is all part of the fun. For a British trainer hoping to recruit new owners, though, it is more than merely irritating or embarrassing. The dream of having a runner, never mind a winner, at Cheltenham is, like it or not, what tempts many owners into the game in the first place. Less prestigious prizes during the dark winter months do not have the same appeal. Why spend six figures on a jumping prospect, and thousands more on training fees in a local stable, if it is just going to get rolled over by the Irish again in March? The idea of the Festival as British jumping’s showpiece event also becomes a harder sell if 95% of the prize money is marked for export every year. This may also be the week when Ireland fields a majority of runners in the Grade One events for the first time. The visitors have 22 of the 42 runners in Grade Ones on Tuesday and last year fielded 47% overall, up from 26% in 2013. One of the few records that survived 2021 – that Ireland has never swept a single day’s card at the Festival – must also be in serious danger. The full strength of the green tide should be apparent by the middle of Wednesday afternoon. Two of the three Grade One favourites from British yards – Constitution Hill in the Supreme Novice Hurdle and Edwardstone in the Arkle – run in the first two races while the mighty, unbeaten Shishkin goes up against Energumene in the Queen Mother Champion Chase the following day, in what promises to be the highlight of the week. Eleven of 14 favourites on the final two days, though, are from Ireland, including six of seven on Friday’s Gold Cup card, when A Plus Tard is likely to head the market to give Blackmore a first win in the Festival’s feature race. Some on the British side suggest it is all just a cycle and that the wheel will eventually turn. They may be right, but for now at least, it feels more like a bandwagon and one that will not stop rolling for a long while yet.",Sport/Sport, Irish trainers on course for another greenwash at Cheltenham Festival | Greg Wood,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/14/irish-on-course-for-another-greenwash-at-cheltenham-festival-horse-racing
3/14/2022,"This could have been Tuesday night all over again. So much of Bayern Munich’s play dazzled a sold-out PreZero Arena, and the champions could easily have done to Hoffenheim what they had done to Red Bull Salzburg four days previously. Maybe the difference between the two games was just “a little bit of luck,” as Thomas Müller said it was. There was certainly little sense of anguish or regret. Julian Nagelsmann may have the luxury of being able to look at the process knowing that the results will likely follow, but he was satisfied with his team’s performance. Bayern are playing way more fluently than they were even a few weeks ago. That they didn’t hand out a second successive thrashing to disoriented opponents was more down to fine margins, with three goals chalked off for offside, and the excellence of a very busy Oliver Baumann in Hoffenheim’s goal. Yet here Bayern are, improbably, on the brink of being dragged back into a Bundesliga title race, and it’s only natural to wonder how this happened. Borussia Dortmund are far from their strongest, decimated by Covid and injury; on Sunday, they squeezed past struggling Arminia Bielefeld thanks to a single goal by Marius Wolf – who would surely not be playing in a healthier squad. Following their Europa League exit to Rangers, it has felt as if BVB’s season is over. Yet if they win their game in hand at Mainz (themselves coming off a hiatus caused by a Covid outbreak), they will nestle just four points behind Bayern with eight games left. You might feel, justifiably, that the carrot of potential competitiveness has been dangled in front of us before. Dortmund have, though, something to feel optimistic about for the first time in weeks – quite unexpectedly. On Sunday, Erling Haaland and Gio Reyna both made their returns as substitutes, Raphaël Guerreiro and Mats Hummels may well have recovered and others are expected to come back too, while who knows how Mainz will emerge from their lockdown? Robert Lewandowski found the leveller but @TSGHoffenheimEN hold on to a well-deserved point against @FCBayernEN... 👀📺 pic.twitter.com/bJYLi6cIOk That Marco Rose’s team are even in this position of promise feels surreal, or it will do if they can treat themselves to maximum points this midweek. Nagelsmann’s calm is entirely justified, and not just because of BVB’s recurrent habit of fumbling this genre of opportunities. But though Bayern are undoubtedly great to watch, the resounding win over Salzburg might have impressed the world at large, but those who watched the game rather than the highlights will be aware of their overcommitment to attack, and its potential consequences against better opponents. “I’ve been asked the question 1,734 times in the last few weeks,” Nagelsmann said in his post-match press conference on Saturday, with more than a hint of exasperation, about his attack-first credo. The three-man defence, with Serge Gnabry and Kingsley Coman as wing-backs, has been examined more forensically than the lack of a defensive-minded partner for Joshua Kimmich in midfield, and gives the impression of a devil-may-care attitude. “I find it disrespectful to Serge and King [Coman] because the whole world says they can’t defend,” Nagelsmann retorted. “They are world-class players, professional footballers, so defending is part of it.” Whether they should be asked to defend like defenders, however, is a different question entirely. Having wide players who can make off-ball efforts has been integral to the strategies of Bayern’s best teams for well over a decade – the shared work ethic of Arjen Robben and Franck Ribéry is part of what made them such an effective partnership. Seeing Coman dash back into his own six-yard box to make a last-ditch block, as he did on Salzburg’s Nicolas Capaldo in the opening two minutes of last week’s Champions League return (the fine detail of which most have expunged from their minds after Bayern’s later goal avalanche), is something else. It suggests neither great organisation nor a sustainable plan. The current situation also reflects a lack of alternatives in the squad, not least in midfield with injuries to Leon Goretzka and Corentin Tolisso, while the wing-back recipe underlines the huge importance of Alphonso Davies, who has returned to light training but is still a few weeks away from a return. Nagelsmann is not inclined to complain about his less-than-perfect room for manoeuvre – and nor should he – but when he said that “Bayern may differ from other clubs in that certain decisions are also made with the players’ consultation,” he perhaps glossed over the fact that the team almost picks itself at the moment – and there are certain strengths on which Bayern have no option but to lean. Whether Dortmund can take advantage – and who knows how much a refreshed Haaland can do – is a question for later in the week. For now, Bayern are playing beautiful and flawed football, and competitiveness could even end up being the winner. Bayer Leverkusen 0-1 Cologne; Borussia Dortmund 1-0 Arminia Bielefeld; Borussia Mönchengladbach 2-0 Hertha Berlin; Eintracht Frankfurt 2-1 Bochum; Freiburg 3-2 Wolfsburg; Greuther Fürth 1-6 RB Leipzig; Hoffenheim 1-1 Bayern Munich; Union Berlin 1-1 Stuttgart Postponed Augsburg v Mainz  After their latest reverse at Borussia Mönchengladbach – allowing the hosts a much-needed 2-0 win and their first clean sheet in four months – Hertha finally drew curtains on the Tayfun Korkut era, announcing the coach’s departure on Sunday morning. Just in case you were thinking everything was finally heading for an even keel, though, Hertha then announced his replacement in the early evening: none other than Felix Magath. In a February interview with Kicker, the 68-year-old spoke out at length against his tyrannical image, noting that he has studied psychiatry to become “more sensitive to psychological issues”. But his appointment does underline the post’s lack of attractiveness to clearer candidates, such as Niko Kovac.  Leverkusen’s derby defeat at home to Köln, authored by substitute Kingsley Schindler’s tidy second-half volley just after coming on, was disappointing enough. But the whole day was overshadowed by the sight of Florian Wirtz being stretchered off in the first half – and the club’s worst fears were realised, with swift confirmation that their teenage star had ruptured his cruciate ligament.  Leipzig continued their fluent form despite going a goal down in the first five minutes at Greuther Fürth; after conceding to Jamie Leweling’s smart finish, Domenico Tedesco’s men led 4-1 by the interval, on their way to a 6-1 victory which sees them remain fourth. “We have a clear plan again,” Emil Forsberg told DAZN of Tedesco, after scoring one and creating two of the goals. “He brought the team back. We’re just playing really great football at the moment.”  The race for the third and fourth Champions League places is close, with Leipzig now just a point behind Leverkusen but level with sixth-placed Hoffenheim and fifth-placed Freiburg – who beat Wolfsburg in a thriller thanks to a late piledriver from their defensive star Nico Schlotterbeck, having given up a 2-0 lead. Die Wölfe’s comeback had been sparked by Max Kruse’s goal, and he was not tender in describing the shortcomings of his team’s young backlinewhen explaining his frustration at the late loss to Sky. “We defended, to put it bluntly, like shit,” moaned Kruse. “We just can’t let in goals like that and we do far too often.”",Sport/Football,Beautiful but flawed Bayern give Dortmund a chance to revive title race | Andy Brassell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/14/beautiful-but-flawed-bayern-dortmund-revive-bundesliga-title-race
3/14/2022,"Germany has warned that an immediate boycott of Russian gas and oil supplies could hurt its own population more than Vladimir Putin, bringing mass unemployment and poverty. “If we flip a switch immediately, there will be supply shortages, even supply stops in Germany,” the economic and energy minister Robert Habeck told public broadcaster ARD on Sunday, as Europe’s largest economy intensely searches to diversify its energy supplies in the medium term. The Green party politician predicted “mass unemployment, poverty, people who can’t heat their homes, people who run out of petrol” if his country stopped using Russian oil and gas. Few other western economies are as dependent on Russian energy as Germany: 55% of the natural gas, 52% of the coal and 34% of mineral oil used in the country comes from Russia, for which it pays hundreds of thousands of euros daily, financially supporting the war machine currently devastating Ukraine. Habeck said his government was working hard to ensure Germany would be in a position to give up Russian coal by the summer, and to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year, but that a short-term ban on Russian gas could leave his country exposed. “With coal, oil and even gas we are step by step in the process of making ourselves independent”, the former Green party co-leader said. “But we can’t do it in an instant. That’s bitter, and it’s not a nice thing morally to confess to, but we can’t do it yet.” The US, which imported roughly 8% of its crude oil needs from Russia in 2021, announced a ban on Russian oil with immediate effect last week, while the UK announced it would phase out Russian oil imports by the end of the year. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has u-turned on a number of foreign policy red lines, consenting to deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine, supporting cutting Russia off from the Swift payment system, and freezing the completed but not yet functional Nord Stream 2 pipeline underneath the Baltic Sea. But the centre-left leader has said his hands are tied when it comes to banning Russian energy. “Currently there is no other way to secure Europe’s supply with energy to generate heat, for mobility, for power supply and for industry,” Scholz said last week. Depending on the predictions of various thinktanks and economic institutes, an immediate stop in Russian gas deliveries could shrink Germany’s GDP by as little as 0.1 or as much as 5.2 percentage points. In an open letter, a number of prominent German scientists, writers and activists have urged the government to take the bold step of cutting itself loose from Russian energy. The Christian Democratic Union party of the former chancellor Angela Merkel has proposed shutting down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline while allowing gas imports via other routes. Germany’s left-liberal government, meanwhile, is trying to buy time in order to fill up its gas reserves, which were undersupplied by Russian energy companies last year and are largely depleted at the end of the winter. In its search for alternative sources of energy, short-term solutions are also hard to come by. Simplifying the process whereby new wind and solar farms are to be authorised was one of the promises of the “traffic light” government’s coalition deal, but construction alone will take time. Building port terminals for liquefied natural gas (LNG), as Germany has now vowed to do in the towns of Brunsbüttel und Wilhelmshaven, usually takes at least five years. “Can’t do is a highly problematic statement”, energy expert Claudia Kemfert told ARD. “Because the likely challenge we are facing is that we have no choice but to can do”.",News/World news,Boycott of Russian gas and oil ‘could cause mass poverty in Germany’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/russian-gas-oil-boycott-mass-poverty-warns-germany
3/14/2022,"Criminal barristers in England and Wales have voted overwhelmingly to take industrial action beginning next month in protest over levels of legal aid funding. A ballot by the Criminal Bar Association (CBA) saw 94% of votes in favour of refusing to accept returns – where a barrister steps in to represent a defendant whose original barrister is unable to attend court – from 11 April. The move is likely to add to the already substantial backlog in the crown courts, which stood at 58,350 cases in figures published last month. The CBA described the usual acceptance of returns as “a gesture of goodwill to prop up the criminal justice system”. After the results of the ballot – based on votes by 1,908 members, out of 2,400 criminal barristers – were published on Sunday night, the CBA’s chair, Jo Sidhu QC, and the vice-chair, Kirsty Brimelow QC, said the current government timetable brought no prospect of a new legal aid settlement until the end of September. They said: “Through our labour and our goodwill, we have sustained a chronically underfunded criminal justice system on behalf of the public while suffering substantial reductions in our real incomes and exhausted by the hugely increased demands placed upon us, often for little or no reward. “We have already lost too many of our colleagues who can no longer afford to maintain their commitment to criminal work and who have left our ranks out of desperation and despair. Every day we are losing more … The future viability and diversity of the criminal bar is already imperilled.” The Independent Review of Criminal Legal Aid, which was published in December, recommended a minimum increase of 15%, amounting to £35m, for advocates, which also includes solicitors advocating in the crown courts. The government’s latest reported timetable is that it will provide its response to the review this week and then hold a consultation that will run until the end of June, followed by implementation of any necessary statutory instruments by the end of September. The CBA has expressed concerns that the minimum increase recommended by the review is insufficient and that barristers may not see any real increase in their legal aid fee income until 2024. In a message to members, Sidhu and Brimelow said: “We will continue to engage with the Ministry of Justice to seek a fair and reasonable settlement that reflects the demands of our members. With your resounding mandate we will pursue those discussions with determination and resolve.” A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “We are disappointed in a vote for this course of action just days before we announce our plans to create a stable and sustainable legal aid sector for the future. “We encourage CBA members to read our proposals in full and respond to the consultation, rather than being drawn into action that will harm victims of crime.”",News/Law,Criminal barristers vote for industrial action over legal aid funding,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/14/criminal-barristers-england-wales-industrial-action-legal-aid-funding
3/14/2022,"The French music group Believe, which has worked with artists including Björk, La Roux and Slayer, has pledged to keep its operations open in Russia and is advising partners how to work around sanctions imposed over the invasion of Ukraine. The company, one of France’s biggest tech businesses valued at €1.1bn (£920m) on the Paris stock exchange, sent a newsletter on Friday to its partners in Russia, including record labels and artists, updating them on its operations in the region. The update, which the Guardian has reviewed in both the original Russian and an English translation, assures its partners that it continues to operate and will continue to make scheduled payments, except to those whose accounts are with banks that have imposed sanctions. The letter then goes on to offer solutions to legally circumvent the banking ban by advising opening a new account with a restriction-free bank and then linking it to Believe. The translation says the company will continue to “promptly adapt our solutions in accordance with ongoing changes”. The position adopted by Believe, which serves artists and independent music labels around the world to build popularity via social media and put their work on streaming platforms such as Apple Music, is in stark contrast to leading players in the music industry. The world’s biggest record companies – Universal Music, Sony Music and Warner Music – have suspended or closed their operations in Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine, as have the streaming services Spotify, YouTube, Deezer and TikTok. Believe has almost 1,500 staff working in 50 countries and claims to provide artists and repertoire (A&R) and management services to 850,000 acts worldwide. Its UK operation lists La Roux, the singer of hits including Bulletproof whose real name is Elly Jackson, Girli, Fumez the Engineer and The Plug as acts on its books. Believe was founded in 2005 and floated on Euronext last year, making it the first flotation of a tech company in Paris since 2014. Late last year, Believe made management appointments to strengthen its business in Russia and eastern Europe, where is estimated to make about 10% of global revenues. “Russia and eastern Europe have long been high priorities for Believe as the company was the first international music company to establish a presence in the region in 2013,” the company said late last year. As of November, Believe said it had a team of 50 in Russia and was also active in 15 eastern European territories, with a team of 25, and had more than 1,000 clients in the region. “They are a public company and they are watching every other business – including the music industry – suspend or shut operations because of what is happening in Ukraine,” said one music industry executive. “Believe has gone in the opposite direction and is not just promoting that they are still in the marketplace but are also actively working to show partners how to get around sanctions.” The company owns brands including New York-based music distribution platform TuneCore and in 2018 bought a controlling stake in Germany’s Nuclear Blast, one of the biggest labels in rock and metal music home to acts including Slayer, Sepultura and Machinehead. Other music labels listed on Believe’s brands page include: Allpoints France, which has worked with Björk; AFM records, which has Anvil and Lordi on its roster; and Naive, home to French acts M83 and Youssou N’Dour. Earlier this month, Björk tweeted to her almost 800,000 followers that she was cancelling a show in Moscow after the invasion. in light of current events the bjork orchestral show in moscow has been cancelled pic.twitter.com/pPNBrO6tgs Companies and artists who work with Believe outside Russia were not party to the memo and are not connected with its stance on continuing operations and payments in the country. David Bianchi, global chief executive of Various Artists Management, which represents La Roux and other artists that have worked with Believe, said: “We were unaware of this situation and are holding urgent talks with Believe to ascertain all the facts in this matter. “Various Artists and the artists we represent stand in full solidarity with Ukraine. We will not be undertaking any commercial or cultural activities that involve Russia or with companies and individuals who are connected to Russia moving forward.” Bianchi said that he had asked Believe UK to remove all marketing and promotional imagery relating to La Roux from its website. Believe did not respond to multiple requests for comment. However, on the situation in Russia the company has previously said its “priority is to ensure the safety of our team members, artists and labels and that of their families in the region, support humanitarian efforts for Ukrainian refugees and adapt our activity in compliance with global sanctions”.

3/14/2022,"Genoa needed someone to steady the ship. By mid-January, the Rossoblù seemed to be disappearing beneath the waves of the Ligurian Riviera, having collected more managers than wins through the first 22 games of this Serie A season. Davide Ballardini was fired in November with the team in 17th in the table. In two months under Andriy Shevchenko, they sunk a further two places. Alexander Blessin arrived promising “high velocity” football, “made of pressing and mentality”. Supporters did not know what to expect. The newspapers promised a disciple of Ralf Rangnick – one who had coached youth teams at RB Leipzig for eight years before taking his first step into management in Belgium with KV Oostende. His impact has been more akin to a deity. Specifically, Neptune: ancient Rome’s god of the seas. Blessin has not so much steadied the ship as stilled the waters completely. Under his leadership, Genoa have played seven and drawn seven. Five of those matches ended goalless. The other two finished 1-1. Put your old cliches about defensive Italian football to one side. Serie A averages 2.9 goals per game this season – second only to the Bundesliga among Europe’s top five leagues. Last season, it was 3.04. The domestic models for success in 2022 are provided by Gian Piero Gasperini – daring his Atalanta players to engage in one-on-one duels all over the pitch – and Roberto Mancini, who made Italy European champions by encouraging his team to have fun. Blessin might even share some of their values. Ahead of Sunday’s game at Atalanta he acknowledged Gasperini’s approach and said it would be up to his players to “make the one-on-ones ours all the way to the 95th minute”. Both managers prefer a high tempo and a higher press, as well as compact formations that keep the distances short between their lines of defence and attack. But as Blessin explained in a previous interview with Voetbalmagazine: “There are different ways to put pressure on the opponent and they can vary a lot from one team to the next. You need to define the when and the how. “There are those who put pressure on the passing lane and those who put it on the player. You can choose to put pressure on the man who holds the ball or to wait for the pass to arrive in open space.” His team blend both ideas but so far have focused especially on the latter. Genoa average 12.4 intercepted passes per game in Serie A – joint-most in the division – but that number is rising. Against Internazionale a fortnight ago they had 17. In Bergamo on Sunday it was 21. Blessin has leaned into the strengths of Genoa’s squad. Taken over by the Miami-based investment firm 777 Partners in September, the club launched a rejuvenation project in January, replacing high-profile veterans with young prospects from across Europe. Goran Pandev, Felipe Caicedo, Ivan Radovanovic and Valon Behrami departed while Kelvin Yeboah, Silvan Hefti, Albert Gudmundsson, Nadiem Amiri and Morten Frendrup arrived. The latter group were more than a decade younger, on average, than the players they were replacing. Blessin appealed to their energy and desire to prove themselves with high-impact gameplans designed to never give opponents a moment’s pause. Has it been a success? That much is a matter of perspective. Genoa have achieved some remarkable results: taking points off Roma and Inter before Sunday’s stalemate against Atalanta. Those would have seemed unthinkable during a grim run under Shevchenko in which they mustered three points from nine games. On the other hand, this run of draws – now just one shy of Serie A’s all-time record – may not save them from relegation. Genoa remain six points from safety. It has been six months since they won a game in Serie A, and 11 since they beat anyone at home. Blessin is not to blame for what came before him, nor for the glaring holes in Genoa’s squad. Their leading scorer, Mattia Destro, has nine league goals this season. Domenico Criscito, the club captain, is next with five. Criscito is also 35 years old, a defender, and off to join Toronto in the summer. He has been out injured for most of the past four months. Only Mohamed Fares, with two goals, has scored more than once in Serie A for them this season. Blessin has experimented with different combinations up front but so far nothing has clicked. Perhaps it is simply a question of being patient. The Bologna defender Arthur Theate, who worked under Blessin at Oostende, recalled his training sessions as extremely intense at the beginning, relying heavily on videos from the manager’s time at Leipzig. “At times we left the pitch perplexed,” Theate told Voetbalmagazine, “because in the course of a training session we would not have taken a single shot on goal.” Atalanta 0-0 Genoa; Fiorentina 1-0 Bologna; Milan 1-0 Empoli; Salernitana 2-2 Sassuolo; Sampdoria 1-3 Juventus; Spezia 2-0 Cagliari; Torino 1-1 Internazionale; Udinese 1-1 Roma; Verona 1-2 Napoli Monday Lazio v Venezia (7.45pm GMT) On the other hand, Genoa cannot afford to learn these lessons slowly if they intend to stay up. The evidence of Sunday’s game was that some players might benefit from shooting practice. Genoa had the best chance of the game, when Destro spread the ball to Frendrup running clean through with a quarter of an hour left to go. The Dane had time to pick his spot at the near post but fired straight at the keeper. Nobody ought to be too critical of a 20-year-old making his Serie A debut. Frendrup was playing in an unfamiliar position, a central midfielder starting at right back, and did a brilliant job of containing Atalanta’s attacks down his flank. The hosts had chances – Luis Muriel clipping the post in the first half and Mario Pasalic sending a one-on-one over in the second – but they were few and far between. Blessin appears to have buy-in from the club’s supporters, who stayed and sung his name at the end. He has signed a contract through to 2024 and his past words suggest he is not afraid of a project. Discussing his future while at Oostende last October, the manager stressed that he wanted to pick his steps carefully. “What’s the point of going to a club that has the ambition to play at the top,” he asked, “but where I’m immediately under fire after two defeats?” He had almost moved to Sheffield United in the spring, only for their interest to be halted by post-Brexit visa laws. Perhaps the Blades’ loss will be Genoa’s gain. Blessin has not suffered one defeat at Genoa yet, let alone two. A listing ship has been steadied. Time is running short, though, to sail it away from the relegation zone.",Sport/Football,"Blessin’s impact at Genoa cannot be disguised, but wins must follow soon | Nicky Bandini",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/14/alexander-blessin-impact-genoa-serie-a
3/14/2022,"The mayors of Poland’s two largest cities have said they are struggling to cope with the huge number of refugees arriving from Ukraine, as UN figures show more than 1.7 million people have crossed into Poland in the weeks since the Russia’s attack began. Rafał Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw, said that 300,000 people had arrived in the capital and pledged to continue to support refugees. But, he said on Twitter: “Our city remains the main destination for Ukrainian refugees. [The] situation is getting more and more difficult every day.” More than 2.8 million people have fled Ukraine since 24 February, when the Russian invasion began. According to UN Human Rights Council data, more than half have travelled to Poland. Refugees arriving to the Polish capital are mainly being accommodated in private residences, as well as two large sports arenas. Signs are now being posted in central train stations in Warsaw to direct people to other parts of Poland where there is more space to accommodate and provide for them. “Big cities in Poland are already overcrowded,” says one sign, “don’t be afraid to go to smaller towns: they are peaceful, have food, infrastructure and are well adapted.” “I have this feeling that Warsaw is full and I hear it from many people. The reception points in Warsaw are also overcrowded,” said Marianna Ossolińska, a coordinator at the Club of Catholic Intelligentsia, which is working with refugees in Poland. Ossolińska is managing their hostel, which offers 70 beds and has been full since shortly after it opened on 2 March. “Many refugees try to come to Warsaw, probably because they believe it will be easier to find transport to western Europe from a capital city, or to find a job or make connections,” she said. Ossolińska said many people working on the ground were now struggling to find places to accommodate everyone. “From day to day, it is much harder to find a private place for refugees.” Kraków’s mayor, Jacek Majchrowski, said that the city was also reaching its capacity, with 100,000 people arriving in the past two weeks. “Kraków is slowly losing the opportunity to accommodate new waves of refugees,” he said, adding that places were now being offered outside the city. On some public transport in Kraków announcements are being shown in Ukrainian as well as Polish to help inform the thousands of newcomers. At the city’s main train station, there are two large tents serving hot food and offering advice to refugees. Inside, people sleep on rollout mats, waiting for trains or considering what to do next. “I’ve heard that Kraków has taken 100,000 people,” said Jacek, a local volunteer helping at the station, “and we are only a city of 800,000.” He added that he had recently helped a mother who had arrived from Lviv with her children and had nowhere to sleep. “I called up my wife and said I’m bringing them home with me.” One organisation, Fundacja Brata Alberta, tweeted about the “tragic” situation in Kraków train station: “There is nowhere to direct the refugees, they are stressed and confused, all help is needed, and above all, premises. We call many places, but the only answer is: there are no more beds.” “Everyone wants to stay in Kraków,” said another volunteer at Krakow train station as she hurried between the groups of people asking for advice, “but there’s no more room.” The Ukrainian flag is visible in almost every other shop and cafe window and the sense of solidarity on the streets of Poland’s second-largest city remains strong, even as the city appears to be reaching its limit for new arrivals. “Citizens of Ukraine have been working with us since the very existence [of our restaurant],” reads one sign in a cafe window in the historic old town, “we are in this together.”",News/Global development,Polish mayors warn cities reaching capacity as Ukrainian arrivals rise,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/14/ukrainian-refugees-polish-mayors-warn
