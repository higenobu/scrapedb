4/27/2022,"Building beautiful places in a way that takes advantage of all that nature provides, while at the same time causing minimal harm to it, is what propelled the architect David Lea, who has died aged 82. His output was not prolific but each project, whether built or unbuilt, demonstrated his determination to create low-impact buildings – at one with the natural world rather than at odds with it. As Lea himself said: “When we build we reveal our vision of the future. One moment the design is inside our heads, the next it is grounded in all its solid reality. This imposes a responsibility which is impossible to avoid. Our vision surely must include the truth of rapidly accelerating climate change and the imperative to preserve the natural habitats of all the creatures with whom we share the Earth.” Lea’s last major project, which epitomised this philosophy, and the crowning glory of a career that began around 1965, is the Wales Institute for Sustainable Education (Wise) building at the Centre for Alternative Technology, near Machynlleth in mid-Wales (2007-10). Designed with the architect Pat Borer, it comprises residential and teaching accommodation, restaurant and workshops, and a circular auditorium enclosed by a seven-metre-high wall of rammed earth. Interspersed among the parts of the building are pools of water, paved terraces and timber-slatted access galleries. It feels more like a Mediterranean hill town than the damp slate quarry reclaimed by the centre when it was established in 1973. The building is made largely from natural products, with timber and limecrete for its structure and walls of lime-rendered hempcrete brightly coloured with limewash. Whatever the weather, the inside spaces are in constant dialogue with the outside, through large sliding windows or carefully positioned zen peepholes, or the oculus that lights the auditorium. Lea’s first important work, which brought him to national attention, was a sheltered housing scheme at Churt, Surrey, built between 1968 and 1991. He designed the early phases following the constructional principles of Walter Segal, who developed a system of easily built timber details that avoided wasteful cutting. In later phases, the influence was more from Japan (which Lea visited in 1975), with a move from bolted joints and boards to carpentry joints and lime-rendered wall finishes. Lime render and locally quarried stone were the chief ingredients for his projects at the Royal Agricultural College (now Royal Agricultural University), Cirencester: a modest library extension (1981) and two phases of student housing (1982 and 1991), both inspired by the vernacular of traditional Cotswold buildings. A tiny studio for an artist in Somerset (1989) surprises yet again. With hardly a straight line or right angle, Lea appears to have moved into an organic, Steiner-inspired world, but its construction is a functional response to the saplings he found when searching for a source of structural timber. All these projects share a similar quality of serenity and simplicity, despite their different palettes and appearance. A modest supply of private houses and small community buildings occupied Lea through the 80s and 90s, together with a succession of competitions for new buildings at Oxbridge colleges; however it is surely a missed opportunity for both Oxford and Cambridge that not one of these seven projects went ahead. Born in Edgbaston, Birmingham, to Betty (nee Rosher), a piano teacher, and Ian Lea, a stockbroker, David had a happy and conventional upbringing. It was family holidays in Scotland that inspired in him a love of the natural world, and it was his art teacher at his school, Clifton college, in Bristol, who suggested he become an architect. In 1958 he went to Pembroke College, Cambridge, to study architecture under the recently appointed Leslie Martin, with Colin St John Wilson and Colin Rowe two of his most influential teachers. He sailed in a yacht to the US to do his year-out with Harry Weese in Chicago, then, after completing the diploma course back in Cambridge, worked for a short time with Wilson. He moved to London in 1966, where he designed housing for the London borough of Merton. Before finishing at Merton, a cousin had approached him to design the Churt project and he was able to go solo. It was also around this time that he became increasingly restless with his life in London. A study trip in 1975 to Mao’s China confirmed political and social ideas already forming in his head. At a talk he gave on his return, he stated: “Three impressions remain clearly in my mind: the extraordinary intensity of the agriculture, the absence of the negative effects of poverty within a basically poor country, and the great gentleness of the people towards each other … China makes one think very hard principally about the balance between one’s own needs and the needs of society.” Holiday trips to a stone cottage in Snowdonia and the rise of the back-to-the-earth movement convinced him that he should move. After six months learning techniques with the self-sufficiency pioneer John Seymour in Pembrokeshire, Lea moved to Ogoronwy, a smallholding in the hills above Porthmadog, Gwynedd. The balance of his new life changed constantly. If there were no clients to serve, he turned his attention to rebuilding his outbuildings and working the smallholding. If the office became busy, the land could look after itself, although, with the help of assistants, work on all fronts was always possible. Indeed, it was Lea’s ideal to live a varied and integrated life, cultivating the land for his family’s daily needs, designing buildings for sympathetic clients who would share his environmental ideals and, when he had time, indulging in his passion for sailing. Rumblings about the fragility of the planet had begun to be heard in the 70s. Lea was among the few who took heed and altered their lives accordingly. Half a century later, the environmental crisis has become critical. Now is the time to take better notice of the principles Lea so fervently followed throughout his remarkable life. He is survived by his partner, Sylvia Harris, his children, Trystan and Teleri, from his marriage to Awel Irene, which ended in divorce, and by his sister, Fiona.

4/27/2022,"Police officers involved in the stop, search and handcuffing of champion athlete Bianca Williams, while her baby was in her car, are to face disciplinary charges that could see them sacked, the Guardian has learned. An investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct of the July 2020 stop of Williams and her partner, Ricardo dos Santos, has concluded there is a case to answer for gross misconduct against five Metropolitan police officers. It is understood that a disciplinary panel will also consider whether racial discrimination played any part in the actions of some of the officers, multiple sources confirm. The officers are understood to deny wrongdoing, insist their actions were correct and will contest the charges. They also enjoy support among their fellow officers and Met leaders. Gross misconduct is the highest level of disciplinary charge a police officer can face. A sixth Met officer has been recommended by the IOPC to face a misconduct charge. After a row erupted about the stop, the then Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, claimed that “any officer worth their salt would have stopped that car”. The IOPC went to the Met with its recommendations that five officers should face gross misconduct charges last month, following its investigation. The Met is understood to have been unhappy with the recommendations. The formal announcement on the discipline charges is expected this week, and may be as early as Wednesday. Williams and Dos Santos were stopped at 1.20pm on 4 July 2020 in Maida Vale, north-west London, by officers from the Met’s Territorial Support Group. Their driving is alleged to have aroused suspicion, with police claiming the Mercedes was being driven erratically. The couple say they were racially profiled. They were searched on suspicion of having drugs and weapons, with none found, while their three-month-old son was in the back seat. Both adults were handcuffed. Officers are claimed to have said they believed they could smell cannabis as their justification for searching the two elite athletes. Dos Santos was driving the Mercedes and Williams was in the rear seat with their baby. The incident lasted an hour and the couple alleged a baton was raised by officers, some of whom are alleged to have been aggressive, with Dos Santos claiming he was “dragged” out of the car. Investigators have reviewed video from the police vehicle, body camera footage from the officers and data from both vehicles. The IOPC’s handling of the case has attracted controversy, initially for allegedly being too lenient. It started as a misconduct investigation, then in June 2021, three officers were placed under investigation for gross misconduct, as the seriousness of the claims escalated. In July 2021, Dos Santos told the Guardian: “The officer dragged me out of the car with a raised baton and handcuffed me, he falsely alleged that he could smell cannabis on me and recorded this as the justification for the search on the stop and search form.” Both he and Williams felt that racism played a part in their treatment, claims which police have rejected. The incident lasted around an hour. Nothing illegal was found and no arrests were made. Both athletes are trained by the former Olympic champion Linford Christie, who accused police of institutional racism. The incident was one of a series of videos surfacing on social media that raised concerns about police tactics and policies. During this incident a distressed Williams tells officers: “My son is in the car.” Dick said police had apologised to Williams for “the distress it has clearly caused her”, and the Met reviewed when those being stopped and searched were handcuffed. It is also conducting a pilot monitoring the ethnicity of those who are stopped by officers while driving. Williams, 26 at the time of the incident, is a gold medal winner at the Commonwealth Games, and Dos Santos, 25, is a Portuguese sprinter. The case will be heard by a disciplinary panel later this year.",News/UK news,Police who handcuffed Bianca Williams to face gross misconduct charge,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/26/police-who-handcuffed-bianca-williams-to-face-gross-misconduct-charge
4/27/2022,"Henry Plumb, Lord Plumb, who has died aged 97, was the only Briton to have been elected president of the European parliament. He held office from January 1987 until July 1989. Plumb owed his victory largely to the last-minute support of the Irish MEPs, who appreciated his farming background and generally conciliatory approach, which they considered unusual in a British Conservative, and to the abstention and in some cases support of the French far right under Jean-Marie Le Pen. But Plumb was elected president above all because people across the House liked and trusted him. The bluff, affable, ruddy-cheeked exterior hid a canny pragmatist strongly committed to building bridges in the general interest, and to the European project. It had been quite a journey for the boy who left school at the age of 15 to help on his father’s farm in Coleshill, Warwickshire, during the second world war. He was the son of Charles and Louise Plumb, educated at King Edward VI school, Nuneaton, and took over the running of the farm and the raising of its herd of dairy cattle after his father’s death in 1952. Plumb gradually progressed through the senior ranks of the National Farmers’ Union to become its president in 1970 and the chair of Copa – the European Association of Agricultural Producers. Elected Conservative MEP for the Cotswolds in the first direct elections in 1979, he quickly made his mark in the European parliament, first becoming chairman of the agriculture committee (in those days one of the most influential), scrutinising the management of the common agricultural policy at a time of European “butter mountains” and “wine lakes”, and then leader of the group of British Conservatives. As president he was responsible for overseeing all the business of the parliament – holding regular meetings with the president of the European Commission and prime ministers of member states, ensuring the smooth running of its committees, and overseeing voting sessions in the chamber. His time in office coincided with a significant extension of the parliament’s competences and powers, with the entry into force of the Single European Act, the first major revision of the Treaty of Rome. Its call for the creation of a single market by 1992, accompanied by a reform of the community’s legislative process with the introduction of cooperation and assent procedures, meant that, from then on, the parliament’s role was to become much more than consultative and would develop into that of co-legislator. On 29 June 1987 he became the first president of the European parliament to address the European Council (the body bringing together prime ministers and heads of state), a tradition that has continued ever since. His main theme was the need for the three institutions – parliament, commission and council – to work together to prepare for the launch of the single market. Another first of the Plumb presidency was the creation in 1988 of the Sakharov prize for freedom of thought, following an initial proposal by the British Conservative MEP Nicholas Bethell. The first winners were jointly Nelson Mandela and Anatoly Marchenko, the Soviet author and dissident. In terms of media coverage of Plumb’s presidency, one incident surpassed all others – when he expelled the Democratic Unionist MEP Ian Paisley from the chamber during the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1988. After Paisley held up a poster denouncing the pope while shouting: “I refuse you as Christ’s enemy and antichrist with all your false doctrine”, he was quickly and summarily bundled out of the chamber by security staff. The pope remained unperturbed. Paisley claimed after the event that he had been grievously mishandled and that Plumb should have never allowed a vicious attack on a member of parliament exercising his right to free speech. In fact the reaction to Paisley’s rant and his ejection had been carefully planned in advance and stage-managed by Plumb’s cabinet, moreover with the Vatican’s full agreement. Shortly before the end of his mandate, as something of a swansong, in February 1989 Plumb visited Argentina, with the discreet blessing of the UK foreign secretary Geoffrey Howe. There he met with the president, Raúl Alfonsín, in Buenos Aires. He was the first British politician to meet the Argentine authorities since the Falklands war seven years previously, and diplomatic relations were still suspended, with all communications having to go through the Swiss consulate. After thanking the European parliament for its support for human rights in Argentina and Latin America generally, Alfonsín then appealed for help from the EU and the European parliament, asking Europe “to show generosity of spirit” to help tackle Argentina’s grave economic problems and crippling levels of debt. Although it was still too early to discuss questions of sovereignty over the Falklands, surely the two sides could start by sitting round a table to discuss economic and trade issues? Plumb replied that perhaps the European parliament could be the vehicle to make that happen, and he would convey Alfonsín’s message to Brussels and London. As it turned out, almost exactly a year later, diplomatic relations between Britain and Argentina were re-established. By that time Plumb had been succeeded as president of parliament. As he made his way out of the chamber for the last time as president, MEPs lined up to offer their thanks and congratulations to “Henry” in various languages. Proudly calling himself “semibilingual”, Plumb did not understand all the words but got the gist, and smiled broadly. He had been knighted in 1973 and raised to the peerage in 1987. He continued to serve as an MEP until 1999 and thereafter, until his retirement in 2017, he actively pursued his two main interests of farming and Europe in the Lords. His wife Marjorie (nee Dunn), whom he married in 1947, died in 2019, and his daughter Elizabeth also predeceased him. He is survived by two children, John and Christine.

4/27/2022,"Juventus had no idea what hit them and Bayern Munich weren’t expecting it either but Liverpool are forewarned, forearmed and not so foolish. They are also better. The Villarreal manager, Unai Emery, insists that having beaten two giants en route to the Champions League semi-final his team no longer have the element of surprise to help see them through. Instead, they must produce the “perfect” performance to defeat a Liverpool team he described as “updated and improved” – and it was “magnificent” before. Emery was sitting on the bench when Sevilla defeated Liverpool in the 2016 Europa League final at the end of Jürgen Klopp’s first season at the club and in the stands in Madrid when they won the Champions League three years later. He has also experienced defeat at Anfield with Arsenal. Now he says he will sit at the side of the pitch at Anfield and face a team who are different again, the product of a plan and the personality of their manager, evolved into something even more complete than ever. “We played Klopp’s team in that final in 2016 and the fact that they’re here in 2022 says a lot about patience, belief and the leadership [needed] to build a team,” Emery said. “This is the best Liverpool I’ve seen. I was there when that magnificent Liverpool won the Champions League and this year watching them, analysing them, it is better. Liverpool are in great moment, with a project that has been growing with Klopp growing for years. “I see an updated and improved version. They have found excellence in certain players,” Emery said, offering an analysis that spoke of admiration and dismissing suggestions that Liverpool could be stopped simply by playing deep and denying them space to run into. “A team that was characterised by running extremely well, superb into spaces, that pressed very high and won the ball back very quickly, has now found a way for players to combine and find spaces inside,” he insisted. “They are a team with a very clear identity that Klopp has designed and improved upon. There was the intensity, the full-backs attacking, a lot of crosses. Now you see players with good feet inside, like Thiago [Alcântara], like Fabinho, like [Sadio] Mané who is playing inside more. “In previous years Mané would get behind you fast – he was hard to stop running in space; now he comes inside, has the ball, there’s more pause, more combinations with teammates, links with [Mohamed] Salah. They have signed Luis Díaz who can dribble, who is a presence inside, able to combine and also play with the intensity they want, someone who can change the pace and play in intermediate positions [between lines]. “You see a Liverpool built in the image of their manager: with a smile, happiness, energy. And as well as that, as the ability to run, which they always had, there’s a pause now. They might find it harder against deep defences but that happens to everyone and this is a side that can play deeper, open the pitch and accumulate players inside, an improved team.” It is a side alerted to the threat faced by Villarreal, unlikely to fall into the trap Juventus and Bayern did. The Spanish side felt that they had been underestimated and maybe even disrespected by their previous opponents; the only lament is that a similar mistake is so unlikely to be made by Liverpool. “The surprise element has declined,” Emery said. “In the first tie against Juventus, the surprise element was there with us not being favourites and also going 1-0 down, which was important in terms of Juventus not reacting. Against Bayern I think it was important too, enabling us to play from deep position [in the second leg]. “That’s not the case any more: if you’re in the semi-final it is because you deserve it. And what we have heard from Liverpool, the things they have said have been very intelligent, the respect they have shown – they know us, they know that it will be hard, the potential we have. They’re favourites, but with respect. “We have to analyse, prepare, produce the best version of ourselves, let the wave carry us. We have to try to get the perfect game: we know this is a semi-final and that we’re playing the biggest favourite, but we believe in ourselves and we want to have our place on the pitch. It’s not a case of finishing and being satisfied [to be here], no: we play a team that under normal circumstances could be better than us but we have our mechanisms, our response, and we have to seek ways to beat them, to compete. Above all, we’re going to live it.”",Sport/Football,Unai Emery admits Villarreal need a ‘perfect’ performance to beat Liverpool,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/26/unai-emery-admits-villarreal-need-a-perfect-performance-to-beat-liverpool
4/27/2022,"“Don’t take risks – stay with us,” says one of the slogans at the Nueva Castilla motel, a $37.85 (£30) per night roadside inn in the Mexican city of Monterrey. But the horrifying discovery of a dead teenager in the lodge’s water tank has sparked a nationwide outcry and protests in a country facing a spiraling femicide crisis that saw 1,000 women murdered last year because of their gender. Demonstrators gathered outside the motel on Monday night for the latest in a series of rallies demanding justice for Debanhi Susana Escobar Bazaldúa, whose disappearance and apparent murder have rekindled devastating memories of a wave of killings in the border city of Ciudad Juárez two decades ago. “Femicide nation,” read one of dozens of handmade placards left outside at a shrine remembering the 18-year-old law student. “We are destroyed inside,” the victim’s father, Mario Escobar, told journalists on Saturday as his daughter was laid to rest at a hilltop cemetery in northern Mexico. Mystery still surrounds what happened to Escobar, a budding lawyer who vanished after leaving a party in the early hours of Saturday 9 April and whose corpse was only found last Thursday, 13 days later. But her case – the latest in a string of gender-related killings and disappearances of young women this year – has scandalized Mexico. At least 52 women have been reported missing in Nuevo León this year, the majority in or around the capital, Monterrey. After Escobar argued with friends, a taxi was reportedly called to take her back to her home in the industrial suburbs of Monterrey. Instead, for reasons unknown, the teenager was left on an empty motorway a few hundred metres from the motel. The driver, who has been accused of making unwanted advances on his passenger, took a haunting final photograph of the student standing alone on the roadside in a long brown skirt and high-top trainers. Video evidence reportedly shows that soon after being dropped off, at about 4.30am, Escobar entered the Nueva Castilla motel. “Debhani went into the building and they are trying to understand what happened … and why she ended up inside this cistern,” her father told reporters on Monday. Investigators, who say Escobar died from blunt force trauma to the head, initially suggested the victim might have accidentally fallen to her death – a version her father has emphatically rejected, claiming she was beaten and strangled. “This was murder. They killed her … and I will not stop until this is cleared up,” Mario Escobar, who commissioned a second independent autopsy and vowed to seek a third if necessary, told reporters. Public anger has been compounded by the fact that it took nearly a fortnight for Escobar’s body to be found, despite police searching the motel on at least four occasions in an operation that included sniffer dogs and drones. Escobar’s death has exposed what activists call Mexico’s worsening gender violence crisis and the botched and apathetic response from authorities. Last year Mexico recorded 1,015 cases of femicide – when a woman is murdered specifically because of her gender – compared with 977 in 2020. Overall, about 3,500 women were killed. “What happened to Debhani happens in thousands of other cases across the country on a daily basis,” said Edith Olivares Ferreto, the executive director of Amnesty International in Mexico. “Eleven women are killed in this country every day. We have at least 20,000 women who are missing in Mexico. And the state’s failures in searching for these women and investigating what has happened to them have remained unchanged for almost 30 years now,” she added. Activist Frida Guerrera, who tries to track down the perpetrators of such crimes, denounced what she described as a never-ending nightmare: “It is every single day.” Guerrera blamed rampant impunity for the emergency in a country where more than 90% of all crimes go unsolved. “When a woman is killed and nothing happens, it kills her whole family, her whole society. Police will find the body sometimes, and then the investigation just stops, so the predators are never brought to justice, and by the next day, they’ve taken another girl. People don’t understand until it’s their own daughter,” she said, urging Mexicans to take the crisis more seriously. “Society will forget again like it has forgotten before. But society should in reality be very worried.” Many women’s rights advocates hoped for progress after the supposedly progressive Andrés Manuel López Obrador was elected president in 2018. Yet López Obrador, a 68-year-old nationalist known as Amlo, has repeatedly clashed with the feminist movement, at times suggesting such campaigners were the tools of his conservative political rivals. In early 2020, after a series of murders provoked demonstrations that some called Mexico’s feminist spring, masked protesters surrounded the presidential palace in Mexico City and daubed its walls with the words: “Amlo is killing us”. Last week, after Escobar’s body was found, Amlo drew further criticism for claiming citizens had no reason to worry. “This happens everywhere,” he said. Olivares Ferreto voiced frustration at what she called Amlo’s repeated attempts to downplay the scale of the violence and government hostility towards “the legitimate struggle of Mexican women” to be safe. “This is one of the governments that has been most vocal about attacking the feminist movement in recent decades,” she said. “All we want is for the state to do its job. We are not talking about reinventing the wheel.” Olivares Ferreto remembered how nearly two decades ago her human rights group had released a report called Intolerable Killings about an internationally notorious wave of femicides in Ciudad Juárez – and the bungled official response. “Tragically, what was happening in Ciudad Juárez in the 1990s, is now happening across the entire country,” she said. “This country has become one big Ciudad Juárez.”",News/Society,‘Femicide nation’: murder of young woman draws attention to Mexico’s gender violence crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/26/murder-young-woman-mexico-femicide
4/27/2022,"Wimbledon chiefs have denied the decision to decline the entries of Russian and Belarusian players to this year’s championships in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was an act of discrimination, a charge made against the All England Club by both the WTA and ATP tours. “It is not discrimination in the form that is being said,” said Ian Hewitt, chairman of the All England Club, after being asked repeatedly about the statements from the other governing bodies in the wake of the ban. “It is a considered view reached as to what is the right and responsible decision in all circumstances.” While there will be no Russian or Belarusian players, Novak Djokovic will officially be able to defend his title at Wimbledon after the AELTC confirmed that mandatory vaccination will not be a feature of the championships this year. At the annual spring press briefing at the All England Club, normally an uneventful outlining of changes for the upcoming Wimbledon tournament, Hewitt and Sally Bolton, the AELTC chief executive, were tasked with explaining their decision to ban Russian and Belarusian players. They said they had no choice but to come to what was “an extremely difficult decision and painful decision”. According to the AELTC, their decision rested on limiting Russia’s global influence and they opted to work within the government guidance provided to them. “The UK government has set out directional guidance for sporting bodies and events in the UK, with the specific aim of limiting Russia’s influence,” Hewitt said. “We have taken that directional guidance into account, as we must as a high-profile event and leading British institution.” In addition to the ban on players, Wimbledon will not accept accreditation requests from Russian media. Discussions continue between the AELTC and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport about whether Russian coaches and other support staff will be allowed to accompany foreign players at Wimbledon . Russian fans will be allowed at Wimbledon. Wimbledon’s decision has been criticised from various directions. The WTA and ATP, which have opted to allow Russian and Belarusians to compete as neutral athletes at their events, are expected to hold meetings at the Madrid Open this week as they decide on their next steps. The tours could theoretically opt for the radical response of withholding ranking points for this year’s Wimbledon. According to Bolton, Wimbledon consulted the other tennis governing bodies and players at length, but they accept not everyone is happy. “We would simply say we can well understand that opinions differ and we’re communicating regularly with the WTA and the ATP and we will try and get our reasons across,” Hewitt said. “We think they understand what a challenging position we’re in. And this is an ongoing communication.” Some have accused the AELTC of hypocrisy, pointing to Wimbledon’s inaction in response to other humanitarian and political crises. Their partnership with the Chinese phone company, Oppo, has been highlighted in light of China’s treatment of Uyghurs and the WTA’s continued concerns about the wellbeing of Peng Shuai. Hewitt responded by referring to the invasion of Ukraine as an “exceptional situation”. “For my part, there are at least three reasons. First, we have an invasion of a sovereign state with the scale and severity that it has. We have a condemnation by over 140 nations through the United Nations. And in our case, we have specific and directive guidance to address matters. So those factors make it a very, very exceptional situation,” he said. The AELTC was also questioned about Mervyn Davies, the current chairman of the LTA and a member of the House of Lords, who refused to remove himself as chairman of the investment firm, LetterOne, in light of the Ukraine invasion. The firm was founded by the Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman and previously boasted other oligarchs as shareholders. Hewitt said Davies is welcome at Wimbledon. “Our decision is in relation to players only and their participation in Wimbledon and how that is presented. It’s only in relation to the players,” he said. Meanwhile, the AELTC officially confirmed there will be no mandatory vaccination for arrivals at Wimbledon this year, in line with the current British entry policy. A year after players were required to stay at a designated hotel and only allowed to move to and from the tournament, there will be no notable Covid restrictions at the championships this year, with players able to return to renting nearby houses and walking to the site.",Sport/Sport,Wimbledon defends player ban as Djokovic is given green light for SW19,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/26/wimbledon-defends-player-ban-as-djokovic-is-given-green-light-for-sw19
4/27/2022,"Leading former diplomats including seven ex-UK foreign and defence ministers have warned the Iran nuclear talks are heading to “corrosive stalemate devolving into a cycle of increased nuclear tension” and urged Tehran and Washington to show more flexibility. Year-long talks in Vienna on reviving the deal and for the US, which was pulled out of the agreement by Donald Trump, to lift sanctions on Iran have effectively ground to a halt in a dispute over whether the west will lift the foreign terrorist organisation designation, and sanctions, against the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). The former diplomats said in an open letter that a final draft text of a renewed agreement was ready to be signed and warned that “for US and European leaders to let slip the opportunity to defuse a nuclear crisis in the Middle East would be a grave mistake”. Washington says the sanctions on the IRGC do not relate to the nuclear deal, but to its long-term terrorist behaviour in the region, including in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. The signatories to the open letter, coordinated the European Leadership Network, include former senior diplomats in 14 countries including the former foreign secretary Jack Straw, former defence secretaries Lord King and Des Browne, as well as the former Conservative Middle East minister Alistair Burt. They say the legacy of Trump’s strategic error in leaving the agreement “can today be measured in the tons of enriched uranium Iran has since accumulated, including uranium enriched to near-weapons grade; in the thousands of advanced centrifuges it is spinning; and, in the rapidly dwindling timeframe for Iran to reach a breakout capability”. The US left the nuclear deal in 2018. Joe Biden on his election as president said he wanted to rejoin so long as Iran came back into compliance with the agreement on nuclear non-proliferation. One proposal that Israel fears the US administration will adopt is to retain sanctions on the elite foreign arm of the IRGC, the al-Quds force, but lift the designation on the IRGC domestically. The letter’s authors acknowledge the politics of the foreign terrorist organisation designation are difficult but insist “there are ways to provide the counter-terrorism benefits of the current designation while still accommodating Iran’s specific request, and consider it imperative that these be fully explored”. “For its part, Iran should not expect a nuclear deal to address broader areas of disagreement between Tehran and Washington. Both sides must approach this final phase of negotiation with an understanding that the strategic implications of failure would be grave and profound.”",News/World news,"Time running out to reach Iran nuclear deal, warn experts ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/time-running-out-to-reach-iran-nuclear-deal-warn-experts
4/27/2022,"A P&O Ferries’ passenger ship which operates between Scotland and Northern Ireland was stranded in the Irish Sea for two hours on Tuesday, following a mechanical failure. The European Causeway, which sails between Cairnryan and Larne, lost power before arriving at the Northern Irish port. The ferry, which can carry up to 410 passengers and 53 crew, left Cairnryan at about 12.00 BST and had been expected to reach Larne at about 14.00. The coastguard was alerted to a mechanical failure on the vessel at approximately 13.30. A tug was sent to the ferry’s location, while local coastguard teams and lifeboats were put on standby. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said the European Causeway restored power and was escorted to the port. It docked at Larne port shortly before 16.00, according to data from vessel tracking website Marinetraffic, nearly two hours after its scheduled arrival. During the incident Jonny Wilson, a passenger who said he was onboard the European Causeway, had tweeted that the ferry had been “sat stationery [sic] for over an hour with no power about 30 mins out of Larne…”. P&O Ferries said the ship had experienced a “temporary mechanical issue”, a spokesperson said, before continuing on its “scheduled journey to the port of Larne under its own propulsion”. The company said there were no reported injuries on board the ferry, and that all relevant authorities had been informed. A “full independent investigation” would be undertaken in port, the spokesperson added. The ferry, which P&O said was specially designed to serve the Cairnryan-Larne route, originally entered service in 2000. All of P&O’s ferries stopped sailing following the group’s mass sacking of 800 workers in March. The European Causeway was prevented from re-entering service in March by the MCA, which detained it after an inspection uncovered reported “failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training”. The ferry was later reinspected and was cleared to sail on 8 April. Mike Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport workers’ union (RMT) said it found reports that the European Causeway was adrift off the coast of Larne “deeply concerning, not least for the agency crew and passengers onboard.”. “The list of offences is now as long as your arm and the government has to step in and protect ferry safety and jobs,” Lynch said, calling on ministers to strip P&O Ferries of its licence to operate its ships.",News/Business,P&O Ferries’ ship left stranded in Irish Sea for two hours after breakdown,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/26/po-ferries-ship-left-stranded-in-irish-sea-for-two-hours-after-breakdown
4/27/2022,"The war in Ukraine will result in expensive food and energy for the next three years, the World Bank has warned, intensifying fears that the global economy is heading for a rerun of the weak growth and high inflation of the 1970s. In a gloomy analysis, the Washington-based development organisation said there was a risk that persistently high commodity costs lasting until the end of 2024 would lead to stagflation – sluggish activity combined with strong cost of living pressures. The Bank’s latest commodity markets outlook said that over the past two years the world had seen the biggest increase in energy prices since the 1973 oil crisis and the biggest jump in food and fertiliser prices since 2008. While the costs of energy and food were likely to retreat from their current levels, they were forecast still to be above the average for the past five years at the end of 2024. As a result of trade and production disruptions caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Bank is forecasting a 50% rise in energy prices this year. It expects the price of Brent crude oil to average $100 a barrel in 2022, its highest level since 2013 and an increase of more than 40% compared with 2021. Prices are expected to fall back to $92 in 2023 but will remain well above the five-year average of $60 a barrel. European gas prices are expected to be twice as high in 2022 as they were in 2021, while coal prices are expected to be 80% higher. The Bank expects wheat prices to increase more than 40% this year, putting pressure on developing economies that rely on wheat imports from Russia and Ukraine. Indermit Gill, a World Bank vice-president, said: “Overall, this amounts to the largest commodity shock we’ve experienced since the 1970s. As was the case then, the shock is being aggravated by a surge in restrictions in trade of food, fuel and fertilisers. “These developments have started to raise the spectre of stagflation. Policymakers should take every opportunity to increase economic growth at home and avoid actions that will bring harm to the global economy.”",News/Business,Ukraine war ‘will mean high food and energy prices for three years’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/26/ukraine-war-food-energy-prices-world-bank
4/27/2022,"Russia has stepped up attempts to encircle defending forces in the east of Ukraine and stood accused of shelling a humanitarian corridor out of Mariupol, as the US vowed to move “heaven and earth” to help Ukraine win the war. Amid a flurry of diplomatic activity in Moscow and Germany, a fresh wave of civilian deaths were reported across eastern Ukraine as Vladimir Putin’s forces escalated their barrage of key targets on Tuesday and appeared to renege once again on giving safe passage to women and children. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, the besieged port city on the Sea of Azov where the remaining Ukrainian forces and civilians have been hiding out in a steel works, said the latest attempt to get people out had failed. Andryushchenko claimed that agreement on a humanitarian corridor out of the Azovstal steelworks had proven to be a “trap”, with Russian forces firing their artillery on the exit zone just moments after announcing through loudspeakers that a green corridor had been opened. Last week, Putin had ordered his troops not to storm the steel mill, but to seal it off so that “not even a fly comes through”. There are an estimated 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the complex, along with many of their families. Andryushchenko said that over the past 24 hours, there had been 35 airstrikes against the Azovstal plant, with one strike causing a fire to break out in one of the workshops where civilians had been hiding, leaving some under rubble. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, meeting the UN secretary general in Moscow, dismissed Ukraine’s proposal to stage peace talks in the port city, saying it was a “theatrical gesture” and “they probably wanted another heartrending scene”. Russia’s apparent flouting of the agreement for a humanitarian rescue of civilians trapped in Mariupol came amid increased efforts to push on in the east of Ukraine. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of the Donetsk region, reported that two people had been killed and six others wounded as “Russians continue to deliberately fire at civilians and to destroy critical infrastructure”. In the neighbouring region of Luhansk, the governor, Serhiy Haidai, said three people had died after Russian shells hit a residential building in the city of Popasna, which Russian forces have been trying to capture. There were also reports of damage to an important bridge across the Dniester estuary linking the strategically vital region of Bessarabia to the rest of the country. Should Ukrainian forces leave Bessarabia for fear of being cut off it could become a staging post for an attack on the Black Sea city of Odesa. Russia has refocused its operations in Ukraine in recent weeks away from storming the capital, Kyiv, in the north and towards creating a Kremlin-controlled region stretching across the east and south of Ukraine. At the US Ramstein airbase in Germany, Joe Biden’s defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, attending a meeting of officials from about 40 countries, pledged more weapons to foil Putin, while Germany announced it had cleared the way for delivery of Gepard anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine. Austin said he wanted to find a “common and transparent understanding of Ukraine’s near-term security requirements because we’re going to keep moving heaven and earth so that we can meet them”. Meanwhile, the head of the UN’s atomic watchdog has condemned the Russian occupation of the Chernobyl nuclear plant, describing the situation as “absolutely abnormal and very, very dangerous”. Rafael Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director general, spoke to reporters as he arrived at the site of the former nuclear power plant, which was occupied by Russian troops for several weeks. Grossi was heading an expert mission to Chernobyl to “deliver equipment, conduct radiological assessments and restore safeguards monitoring systems”, the IAEA said.",News/World news,Russia accused of shelling Mariupol humanitarian corridor,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/russia-accused-of-shelling-mariupol-humanitarian-corridor
4/27/2022,"Trevor Noah processed Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter on Monday night’s Daily Show, after the billionaire Tesla and SpaceX CEO bought the social media company for $44bn. Twitter’s board had previously said they wouldn’t sell, “I guess they found that edit button after all,” Noah quipped. After previously stating they would “never sell to Elon Musk,” Twitter accepted Musk’s bid, meaning the edit button really does exist? pic.twitter.com/tKzGcxsO4H “This is actually a historic moment: this is the first time anyone at Twitter has changed their mind about anything,” he added. Noah wondered why Musk would want to own Twitter, as “it just doesn’t seem like a fun place to supervise right now. It’s like buying Jurassic Park after the power went down and the cages were opened.” But “by buying Twitter, Elon Musk gets to own one of the most culturally influential publishing platforms in the world”, he explained. “I mean remember this, think about it. Twitter is how the Arab spring took off, right? Black Lives Matter blew up on Twitter. The #MeToo movement started on Twitter. Trump used Twitter to turn himself from a reality show joke into the 45th president of the United States and a joke. So owning Twitter gives you more power than the dru store employee with the key to the deodorant shelf.” Whether you’re into Elon Musk or not, “you’ve gotta admit, it’s pretty crazy that one man is now in control in all of that,” Noah concluded. As a private company “everything that happens on Twitter from now on is up to him. And also whatever strain his weed guy gives him that day. “Whether it’s a billionaire you like or a billionaire you hate,” he added, “as a society I think we should spend more time interrogating how easy it is for billionaires to shape our world in their favor.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers dove into yet another trove of Trump White House text messages from the immediate aftermath of the 6 January attack on the Capitol. According to records of text messages to and from former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Trump’s daughter Ivanka texted Trump’s advisers on 6 January: “You are all WARRIORS of epic proportions! Keep the faith and the fight!” “She’s trying to overturn the results of the election with the tone of a Peloton instructor,” Meyers noted. “Also, just a tip: if you’re planning a coup, maybe don’t do it via group chat.” In other Trump-related news, “Republicans have made it clear they will debase themselves in the most humiliating ways possible to slink back to Trump and earn his support,” Meyers said, noting the about-face by JD Vance, a Senate candidate from Ohio. Vance first rose to prominence in 2016 with the publication of his memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, and as a harsh critic of Trump from within the Republican party. Now, however, Vance has “now come crawling back to Trump’s endorsement by mindlessly parroting his various lies and conspiracy theories”, Meyers explained, pointing to a rally the two hosted in Ohio over the weekend, in which Vance falsely claimed the FBI had wiretapped Trump. “These guys just make shit up and don’t bother to explain it with made-up details because they don’t have to,” Meyers explained. “They say they’re done with Trump on January 6 only to change their mind, their base doesn’t care. They claim they never said something, only for tape to prove they’re lying – Fox News doesn’t cover it. They say the FBI wiretapped the president without proof, the crowd cheers. “Because their base supports Donald Trump, the flip-floppiest, most truth-allergic, evidence-free human being who ever stood at a podium and bitched about toilets,” he concluded. “So of course Vance and all his allies have come slinking back.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel also tore into the new batch of Mark Meadows text messages, including one from Donald Trump Jr that read: “This is one you go to the mattresses on. They will try to fuck his entire legacy on this if it gets worse.” “Please, tell him, he won’t take my calls, Mark!” Kimmel mocked. Kimmel also mocked the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, who was caught on tape saying he’d push Trump to resign following the insurrection. (McCarthy has publicly denied saying this.) According to the tape, McCarthy said in January 2021: “I’ve had it with this guy. What he did is unacceptable. Nobody can defend that, and nobody should defend it.” “That’s right, but then three weeks later, Trump’s prison bitch was back for the free cigarettes,” Kimmel said of McCarthy visiting Trump at Mar-a-Lago in the weeks after the insurrection. “An Altoid lasts longer than Kevin McCarthy’s convictions.”",Arts/Culture,Trevor Noah on Musk and Twitter: ‘I guess they found that edit button after all’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/26/trevor-noah-elon-musk-twitter-daily-show-recap
4/27/2022,"The latest supermarket data from Kantar shows shoppers have been stockpiling cooking oil due to concerns about the shortage of sunflower oil caused by the Russia-Ukraine war. Here we look at what’s behind the shortages, what the situation means for consumers and how long it might last. In a manner reminiscent of the controls put in place on popular items such as flour, eggs and toilet roll, during the pandemic a number of supermarkets, including Tesco, Morrisons and Waitrose, have restricted the number of bottles shoppers can buy to ensure there is enough to go round. In its monthly review of supermarket sales trends Fraser McKevitt, Kantar’s head of retail and consumer insight, explains why purchase limits might have been required. In the four weeks to 17 April (before restrictions were in place) sales of all cooking oils were up by nearly a fifth as consumers “stocked up”. Cooking oil sales were up 17%, McKevitt explained, due to a combination of “rising prices and increased demand”. Within that demand for sunflower and vegetable oil was the greatest, up 27% and 40%, respectively. Taken together, Ukraine and Russia account for about 60% of world production of sunflower oil so the disruption to exports caused by the war has resulted in a major supply shock. Millions of tonnes of sunflower oil earmarked for foreign buyers is trapped in Ukraine, triggering a scramble to source alternative vegetable oils of which there is not enough to go round. The situation is acute in the UK as most of our sunflower oil comes from Ukraine. Prior to the crisis sunflower oil represented about a fifth of the cooking oil market by value in UK supermarkets and 44% by volume, according to data firm NielsenIQ. A huge rush to secure substitute vegetable oils for business and home use is pushing up prices on global markets. Prices were already extremely high, due to crop problems linked to the Covid pandemic as well as the climate crisis. In 2021, farmers in Canada, the biggest exporter of rapeseed, had a disastrous growing season after temperatures soared to almost 50C. The soya bean oil price is also high amid forecasts of smaller harvests from growers in Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay after severe drought. The South American countries account for more than 50% of world supply. Indonesia is to ban the export of some palm oil products – a move likely to lead to a fresh squeeze. Palm oil – used in everything from cakes and frying fats to cosmetics and cleaning products – accounts for nearly 60% of global vegetable oil shipments, while Indonesia accounts for around a third of all vegetable oil exports. “Indonesia’s decision affects not only palm oil availability, but vegetable oils worldwide,” James Fry, chairman of commodities consultancy LMC International, told Reuters. “This is happening when the export tonnages of all other major oils are under pressure: soya bean oil due to droughts in South America; rapeseed oil due to disastrous canola crops in Canada; and sunflower oil because of Russia’s war on Ukraine.” The shortage of sunflower oil is not just an issue for retailers. As well as being a staple at home, it is used to make hundreds of foods, including crisps, biscuits, fish fingers and mayonnaise. Many food firms have been forced to alter their recipes at short notice. To prevent food production lines grinding to a halt the government has allowed manufacturers to switch to rapeseed oil with the proviso they update their labels as soon as possible. To increase the supply of vegetable oil there have been calls for governments to divert crops away from fuel tanks, by relaxing their biofuel mandates. Biofuels account for about 15% of global demand for vegetable oil as countries try to cut their reliance on fossil fuels. However there is no sign of this happening yet. The situation is unlikely to recover until at least the end of the summer, says Gary Lewis, of oil importer KTC Edibles, when more of the new rapeseed oil crop becomes available to buy. “There maybe some more supplies of EU and Argentine sunflower oil in the market in the next few months, but it will still be limited,” he says. In normal times shoppers buy cooking oil every eight to 10 weeks, so demand might start to slow down in the coming weeks, leading to fewer gaps on shelves, with would-be buyers potentially deterred by the higher price. According to Kantar, consumers are paying 20% more per litre of vegetable oil this year and 16% more for sunflower oil. Consumers will start to see a different mix of cooking oils as retailers look to plug gaps, with more soy bean and corn oils – as well as vegetable oil blends made from rapeseed and soy in a bid to keep prices down as much as possible.",News/Business,Why are UK supermarkets rationing cooking oil?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/26/uk-supermarkets-rationing-cooking-oil-tesco-morrisons-waitrose-shortages-ukraine
4/27/2022,"Workers upgrading water supplies in southern Spain have come across an “unprecedented” and well-preserved necropolis of subterranean limestone vaults where the Phoenicians who lived on the Iberian peninsula 2,500 years ago laid their dead. Archaeologists exploring the site – which was discovered amid the Roman ruins in the town of Osuna, 55 miles (90km) east of Seville – say the Phoenician-Carthaginian cemetery dates back to the fourth or fifth century BC and is highly unusual as such sites are normally found in coastal areas rather than so far inland. Although the local ruins of the Roman city of Urso are well known, the discovery of the Phoenician necropolis has stunned archaeologists and locals. The only similar finds have been made around the coast of Cádiz, which was founded by the Phoenicians in 1100BC and which is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Europe. Preliminary surveys have so far turned up eight burial vaults as well as staircases and areas that are thought to have served as atriums. The culture and historical heritage department of the Andalucían regional government, which is overseeing the excavations, said its archaeologists had discovered “a series of remains of unquestionable historical value” that were “unprecedented in inland Andalucía”. The lead archaeologist, Mario Delgado, described the discovery as very significant and very unexpected. “To find a necropolis from the Phoenician and Carthaginian era with these characteristics – with eight well tombs, atriums and staircase access – you’d have to look to Sardinia or even Carthage itself,” he said. “We thought we might find remains from the imperial Roman age, which would be more in keeping with the surroundings, so we were surprised when we found these structures carved from the rock – hypogea [subterranean vaults] – perfectly preserved beneath the Roman levels.” Rosario Andújar, the mayor of Osuna, said the find had already prompted a re-examination of the area’s history. “We all know that excavations in certain parts of our town are pretty likely to turn up remains that have varying degrees of historical value, but we’ve never gone this deep before,” said Andújar, who visited the site on Monday. The new evidence of a Phoenician-Carthaginian presence in the area, added Andújar, “doesn’t change history – but it does change what we’d known until now about the history of Osuna, and it could be a turning point”. The mayor said that while more research needed to be done, the luxurious nature of the necropolis suggested it had been built for those at “the highest level” of the social hierarchy. “The operation isn’t over yet and there’s still more to be discovered,” she said. “But the team has already come up with reliable information that attests to the historical importance of all this. Both the graves themselves and the ritual spaces that are being examined suggest that this wasn’t any old burial site.” Osuna, which has a population of nearly 18,000, found a worldwide audience eight years ago when parts of the fifth season of Game of Thrones were filmed in the town.",News/World news,Workers discover ‘unprecedented’ Phoenician necropolis in southern Spain,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/unprecedented-phoenician-necropolis-osuna-spain
