1/15/2022,"While the markets digest the inflation numbers on Wednesday, all eyes will be focussed on the Federal Reserve's reaction to the inflation data. Many economists expected the 7% gain in the Consumer Price Index, marking a 39-year high. Many markets, including stocks and bitcoin, have come under pressure this year on expectations that the Federal Reserve will likely raise interest rates sooner and more frequently than earlier anticipated. Experts consider rising inflation one of the biggest market risks this year because runaway inflation could corrode asset values, limit buying power and eat away at corporate margins. In a research note, Goldman Sachs' Jan Hatzius has warned that rapid progress in the U.S. labor market and hawkish signals in minutes from the Dec. 14-15 Federal Open Market Committee suggest faster normalization, with the central bank now likely to raise interest rates four times this year and start its balance sheet runoff process in July, if not earlier. But the commodities sector is a different beast altogether. Commodities outperformed other asset classes in 2021 and are widely expected to remain competitive in 2022. Indeed, Goldman Sachs global head of commodities research Jeffrey Currie has reiterated his earlier call saying we are merely at the first innings of a decade-long commodity supercycle. Speaking at CNBC's 'Squawk Box' to break down the latest moves in oil prices, Currie says the fundamental setup in the commodities complex, including oil and metals, remains incredibly bullish. According to the analyst, the oil markets are currently in a big deficit of 2% of global demand, with inventories about 5% below their 5-year moving average. He goes on to say the financial set up offers even more support since fossil fuels remain out of favor with the investing universe while ESG headwinds pose a major challenge for a sector that badly needs new investments if production is to keep up with demand. It's a point that has been reiterated by UBS analysts, ""relative to oil prices, the sector looks cheap. Free cash flow yields are very attractive, capital discipline has improved, and the sector should benefit as demand recovers."" Copper is the new oil Currie also says that there has been a complete redirection of capital over the past few years due in large part to poor returns in the oil and gas sector, with flows moving away from old-world economy investing style in things like oil, coal, mining, and towards renewables and ESG-- and now there is a demand imbalance is being exposed. The GS commodities expert adds that stretched equity valuations and low Treasury yields make commodities even more attractive for investors wary of the high risks in these markets but still hunting for decent returns. In other words, commodities not only offer good prospects on a pure return basis but can also be a good hedge against growing market volatility. Goldman Sachs continues its bullish tone on crude prices, and has hiked its Brent crude price forecast to $90/bbl from an earlier $80/bbl. But it's Currie's remarks about the metals sector that will probably catch the attention of ESG and clean energy investors more. According to the analyst, the biggest beneficiary of the ongoing commodity supercycle are metals, which he has compared to oil in the 2000s thanks mainly to green capex. Currie says the ESG and clean energy transition is massive, with nearly all of the world's nations pursuing clean energy goals at the same time, making copper one of the most important commodities of this cycle. Indeed, Currie has declared copper as the new oil, noting it's absolutely indispensable in global decarbonization strategies with copper shortages already being felt. Other notable clean energy experts share Currie's views. New energy research outfit Bloomberg New Energy Finance says the energy transition is responsible for driving the next commodity supercycle, with immense prospects for technology manufacturers, energy traders, and investors. Indeed, BNEF estimates that the global transition will require ~$173 trillion in energy supply and infrastructure investment over the next three decades, with renewable energy expected to provide 85% of our energy needs by 2050. Clean energy technologies require more metals than their fossil fuel-based counterparts. According to a recent Eurasia Review analysis, prices for copper, nickel, cobalt, and lithium could reach historical peaks for an unprecedented, sustained period in a net-zero emissions scenario, with the total value of production rising more than four-fold for the period 2021-2040, and even rivaling the total value of crude oil production. Source: Eurasia Review In the net-zero emissions scenario, the metals demand boom could lead to a more than fourfold increase in the value of metals production–totaling $13 trillion accumulated over the next two decades for the four metals alone. This could rival the estimated value of oil production in a net-zero emissions scenario over that same period, making the four metals macro-relevant for inflation, trade, and output, and providing significant windfalls to commodity producers. Estimated cumulative real revenue for the global production of selected energy transition metals, 2021-40 (billions of 2020 US dollars) Source: Eurasia Review Long-Term Oil Price Outlook Commodity experts at Standard Chartered have released their latest commodities update wherein they expect a medium-term deceleration in both demand growth and non-OPEC supply growth. Stanchart has projected demand to average 106.5 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2026, based on announced and likely government policies, which would leave demand well above the International Energy Agency (IEA) net-zero emission path, in which demand falls to 78.4mb/d by 2030. Further, the analysts say all the incremental 5.2mb/d of demand from 2023 to 2026 is likely to come from non-OECD countries, with OECD demand forecast to average 45.8mb/d in 2026, 1.9mb/d less than in 2019 and 4.3mb/d below its 2005 peak. The analysts say 2022 and 2023 are likely to be more of a challenge for OPEC than 2024 and beyond. The increase in the call on OPEC across 2022 and 2023 is put at 1.4mb/d, suggesting that a return of further Iranian volumes would leave little space for increases elsewhere in OPEC if it occurs before 2024. Luckily for the oil bulls, the outlook becomes tighter after 2023, with the call on OPEC increasing by 3.2mb/d from 2023 to 2026. Stanchart has raised its 2022 Brent forecast USD 8/bbl to USD 75/bbl and its 2023 Brent forecast USD 17/bbl to USD 77/bbl.

1/15/2022,"This month marks an anniversary of sorts, as it was three years ago that the current bull market got started. Aside from the short, albeit deep, turndown in Feb/March of 2020, when the corona truck hit us, stock markets have been rising steadily since January 2019. And despite the pandemic, the market’s rate of increase was steeper after the short 2020 recession than before it. In a recent note, Raymond James CIO Larry Adam says it’s time to ‘adjust our aim’ to take into account the dynamics of a bull market’s third year. He writes, “[The] returns in the third year of a bull market are historically more muted in comparison to those for the first and second…” Even so, Adam points out that we’re still looking at ‘above-trend economic growth,’ which will be supportive of stocks. He notes that the macroeconomic backdrop may end up supporting overall EPS growth of 14%, in which case “the S&P 500 could easily reach the 5,050 milestone.” That would translate to a 9% annual gain for the index. Adam adds that stocks should remain attractively priced, even at increased valuation, given that we’re still (for now) operating in a low interest rate environment. In a final comment on the bull market, Adam emphasizes ""the importance of selectivity and identifying key long-term growth catalysts."" The stock analysts at Raymond James have been following this advice, picking out equities which they believe will win in the current market conditions. We’ve used TipRanks' database to pull the details on a couple of those stocks, Strong Buy choices with plenty of upside potential, at least 50%, for this year. Let's dive in and check out what makes them so compelling. ReneSola, Ltd. (SOL) Connecticut-based ReneSola is a holding company whose subsidiaries work at developing, building, operating, and selling solar-electric power projects in the US and European markets. The company has worked to diversify its approach, including not just solar power project development and electrical power generation, but also the design and building of solar modules and balance-of-system components, and contracting for construction and management of solar projects. The company is also an independent power producer, with more than 173 megawatts of solar power production in operation globally. Solar power is known for its volatility as an energy source – it is only reliable during daylight, and everything from dust to snow can block the panels – and ReneSola’s quarterly results do reflect this aspect of the business. The last report, for 3Q21, is a good example; the company showed over $15.5 million at the top line, which was simultaneously up 59% year-over-year and 23% below the market expectation. Earnings results also showed mixed results. The quarter was the sixth profitable quarter in a row, with EPS of 2 cents – but the market had been estimated a 4-cent EPS, and one year earlier, the company had achieved 5 cents. Looking forward, however, ReneSola has fine prospects for continued expansion. The company in December entered an agreement to sell 12 megawatts worth of power projects in Spain, and earlier this month it closed on a sale of 38 megawatts of solar projects in Poland. Back in November, ReneSola launched its first solar power project in Italy. These are just a few of the company’s recent expansionary moves – but even so, the stock is down 76% over the past 12 months. According to Raymond James’ 5-star analyst Pavel Molchanov, however, investors can use this as an opportunity. ""Among U.S.-listed solars, ReneSola stands out for its substantial European footprint — comprising more than two-thirds of the project pipeline — making it one of the most direct ways for investors to get exposure to energy transition in Europe, bolstered by the world’s strongest climate policy. As a downstream pure-play with a predominantly build-and-sell business model, capital intensity is low, but the flip side is that revenue is lumpy from quarter to quarter. Following the stock’s 2021 underperformance — despite exceeding margin expectations, even amid input cost inflation across the value chain — we are raising our rating from Outperform to Strong Buy."" That Strong Buy rating comes with a $12.50 price target, which suggests a strong upside of 105% in the year ahead. (To watch Molchanov’s track record, click here) Overall, SOL gets a Strong Buy rating from the Wall Street consensus, too, with 3 positive reviews for a unanimous view. The shares are selling for $6.17 and their $12.50 average price target matches Molchanov’s, for a 105% one-year upside potential. (See SOL stock forecast on TipRanks) First Watch Group (FWRG) The second stock on Raymond James' radar, First Watch, is an award-winning dining chain, serving breakfast, brunch, and lunch on a made-to-order basis. The chain uses fresh ingredients sourced daily, and offers a mixed menu of well-known favorites like pancakes, omelets, and salads next to specialty items like the Quinoa Power Bowl. The chain boasts over 430 locations in 28 states. First Watch, based in Bradenton, Florida, has been in business since 1983, and took advantage of the rising market environment to go public this past October. The stock entered the NASDAQ index on October 1 with an initial price of $18 per share and over 10.8 million common shares made available. The offering raised over $195 million in gross proceeds. In November, the company released its first quarterly report as a public entity, and showed strong growth in several key metrics. Same-store sales grew 46% year-over-year, and restaurant traffic was up 40%. Total revenue reached $157.4 million, for 57% yoy growth, and earnings came in at a net positive of 2 cents per share. In its forward outlook, the company is expected full-year fiscal 2021 same-store sales growth in the range of 31.5% to 33.5%, and is predicting adjusted net earnings in the range of $10.2 million to $11.2 million. All of this adds up to an opportunity for investors, in the view of Raymond James analyst Brian Vaccaro. In his coverage of this stock, Vaccaro writes: “First Watch is a rapidly growing, full service restaurant concept with a strong track record of generating positive comps and attractive ROI’s on new unit growth that has been replicated across many markets. We believe the company is well positioned to continue gain share in the growing breakfast category, while sustaining 10%+ unit growth for the foreseeable future. We also believe the stock is reasonably valued in light of the company’s attractive growth prospects."" To this end, Vaccaro rates FWRG an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $24 price target implies an upside of 58% in the next 12 months. (To watch Vaccaro’s track record, click here) While the consensus view on FWRG is not unanimous, the 10 reviews do include 8 Buys that outweigh the 2 Holds, for a Strong Buy rating. Shares are priced at $15.18 and their $25.80 average price target suggests an upside of 69% from that level over the course of 2022.
