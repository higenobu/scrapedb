2/7/2022,"The ""Freedom Convoy"" began as a movement against a Canadian vaccine requirement for cross-border truckers but has turned into a rallying point against public health measures and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government. Protesters have paralyzed downtown Ottawa for the past nine days, with some participants waving Confederate or Nazi flags and some saying they wanted to dissolve Canada's government. Amid incessant horn blaring and occasional fireworks, a polished supply chain -- including portable saunas, a community kitchen and bouncy castles for children -- has sustained the protesters to the fury of residents who blame police for inaction. Ottawa police relocated some protesters and put up fresh barricades on Sunday, saying they are ""collecting financial, digital, vehicle registration...and other evidence that will be used in criminal prosecutions.""",Politics/Reuters Videos,Ottawa declares state of emergency over anti-vax truck protest,https://news.yahoo.com/ottawa-declares-state-emergency-over-220328329.html
2/7/2022,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., announced a rally in Texas to support two candidates in next month's Democratic primary. ""Texans, are you ready?"" Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter. ""We’re coming in for a major DOUBLE-RALLY next Saturday, Feb 12th… This one’s going to be special."" Ocasio-Cortez will rally in support of Greg Casar, who the New York Democrat officially endorsed last week. ""Because of his roots as a labor organizer, I know Greg and I will work together to organize year-round and deliver on Medicare for All, good jobs, and climate justice,"" Ocasio-Cortez said at the time. ""I’m proud to support his campaign and will be doing everything I can to help him win this primary on March 1."" The rally will also support Jessica Cisneros, who is looking to unseat incumbent Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, in Texas' 28th Congressional District. Cuellar previously bested Cisneros by four points in the 2020 primary, but now faces controversy after his home was raided by FBI agents last month. The FBI has not charged the lawmaker with a crime, but Cisneros has called the investigation ""alarming"" and boasted that Ocasio-Cortez is ""ready to work alongside us to finally bring true representation to South Texas families."" Casar, who faces off with three other candidates in Texas' 35th Congressional District, said he was ""honored"" to have the endorsement of Ocasio-Cortez. ""I’m honored to have earned the endorsement of Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, who boldly fights for working families every single day,"" Casar said of the endorsement. ""I look forward to working with her to deliver for TX-35 residents."" Ocasio-Cortez has previously criticized her fellow Democrats for not using her or other progressives on the campaign trail, saying the party made a ""mistake"" by being too moderate during the Virginia gubernatorial race that Republican Glenn Youngkin won last November. ""Before the Virginia elections, it was very clear that our help and our participation was not wanted or asked for, which is fine. I’m not here to tell people how to run their races,"" Ocasio-Cortez said at the time. ""But at the same time, to consider the members here that have some of the tightest relationships to our political base as just a uniform liability – and not something that can be selectively deployed, or consulted, or anything – I think it’s just sad. I think it was a mistake."" The New York Democrat added that ""not a single person"" asked her to send an email to people on her ""own list,"" but the party still laid blame on progressives for their defeat. ""The idea that we just accept a collapse in youth turnout – and essentially turn it into a self-fulfilling prophecy – in times when races are decided by such narrow margin points: I think it’s ill advised,"" she said.",Politics/Fox News,AOC heading to Texas to campaign against Democratic colleague,https://news.yahoo.com/aoc-heading-texas-campaign-against-204221514.html
2/7/2022,"MIT researchers have developed a new material that's as strong as steel but as light as plastic. It can be easily manufactured in large quantities, and the use cases range from lightweight coatings for cars and phones to building blocks for massive structures such as bridges, according to Michael Strano, the Carbon P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT and the senior author of a new study. “We don’t usually think of plastics as being something that you could use to support a building, but with this material, you can enable new things,” he said in a statement from MIT. “It has very unusual properties and we’re very excited about that.” The material is several times stronger than bulletproof glass, and the amount of force needed to break it is twice that of steel, despite the fact that the material has only about one-sixth the density of steel, according to MIT. The researchers were able to do this by developing a new process to form polymers. Plastics are an example of polymers, along with rubber and glass. OTHER MIT RESEARCH: MIT researchers develop glow-In-the-dark plants The researchers wanted to see whether they could create a two-dimensional version of a polymer that could remain flat, thus making it lightweight. They tried for decades to create such a material, and the new process they developed was published in peer-reviewed journal Nature last week. Polymers are essentially chains of individual molecules, called monomers, linked together by chemical bonds. Normally, when polymers are formed, they expand into three-dimensional objects, like how a sheet cake rises as it bakes in an oven. The challenge is if even one monomer begins to rotate, the polymer becomes three-dimensional. For example, imagine if you wanted to line up children and pack a bunch of them in an auditorium by having them link arms. However, if even one of the children choose to be unruly and shift around, it would be impossible to maintain order. The key came from building a process that could allow the monomers to link up and grow into a polymer chain without causing any one of the monomers to stray. If you could build several two-dimensional polymers, you could layer them like disks and stack a bunch of them together in a tight space, similar to how you could pack lines of children into an auditorium, if they're well-behaved.
