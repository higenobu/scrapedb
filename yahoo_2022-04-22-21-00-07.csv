4/22/2022,"The parents of Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Dwayne Haskins say they will not attend his funeral services on Friday. “We have never met or spoken to the wife, and we didn’t want our son’s funeral service to be the place we met her for the first time,” says Dwayne Sr. and Tamara Haskins in a statement. Haskins was killed April 9 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, when he attempted to cross an interstate and was hit by a dump truck. The Florida Highway Patrol said in a crash incident report that Haskins was also struck by a second vehicle. A 911 call later revealed that Haskins' wife called authorities from Pittsburgh to let them know that Haskins had run out of gas and was walking to get assistance. She called 911 after not hearing back from him. Two memorials are planned in Haskins' honor – one Saturday in Rockaway Township, New Jersey, and a vigil planned for Sunday at Haskins' high school, Bullis School in Potomac, Maryland, will still go on as planned. The Florida Highway Patrol is still trying to determine the circumstances of Haskins' death and is not commenting until its investigation is complete, which could take up to 90 days.

4/22/2022,"Mike Pompeo, Donald Trump’s former secretary of state, left critics bemused on Thursday with an apparent slip-up on Fox News that some commenters viewed as a rare moment of honesty. “Why does the left act as if conservatives are a bigger threat to America than the” Chinese Communist Party? Fox News’ Laura Ingraham asked Pompeo. “Because, in fact, we often are,” replied Pompeo, a potential 2024 GOP presidential contender, before launching into his talking point attacking “the left” for what he called its “deep ties” to communism.

4/22/2022,"TOKYO (AP) — Japan describes four islands whose ownership it disputes with Moscow as “illegally occupied by Russia” in the latest version of a diplomatic report released Friday, using stronger language to describe the territorial flap than other recent versions and underscoring the chilled relations between the two sides amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The description in the 2022 Diplomatic Bluebook, an annual report on Japan's foreign policy issued by the Foreign Ministry, uses that phrasing for the first time in nearly two decades. Japan, which is struggling to improve ties with Moscow to regain control of the Kurils, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, had previously described the dispute in a softer tone. “The Northern Territories are a group of islands Japan has sovereignty over and an integral part of Japan’s territory, but currently they are illegally occupied by Russia,” the ministry said in the report. The dispute over the Russian-held islands, which the former Soviet Union seized from Japan at the end of World War II, has prevented the two countries from signing a peace treaty formally ending their war hostilities. The report last used a similar expression in 2003 but had toned down its phrasing until last year, when it described the dispute as “the greatest concern between Japan and Russia” and noted that “Japan has sovereignty” over the islands. In another territorial dispute, the ministry said the island that Japan calls Takeshima is “illegally occupied” by Seoul, which calls it Dokdo. South Korea’s Foreign Ministry protested Japan’s “repeated inclusion of unjust sovereignty claims over Dokdo,” calling the island an integral part of South Korean territory. It said Tokyo’s repeated claims are in “no way conducive to efforts to establish a future-oriented relationship between the two sides. Japan-South Korea ties have been also badly strained by historical issues. Japan has joined other Group of Seven countries in imposing a series of sanctions against Russia. Tokyo is taking a greater role in the international effort against Russia because of its concerns about the impact of the invasion in East Asia, where China’s military has grown increasingly assertive. Japan has already faced reprisals from Russia, which recently announced the suspension of talks on a peace treaty with Tokyo that included negotiations over the disputed islands. Japan also seeks to bolster its defense capability and budget as part of a key revision to Japan’s national security strategy expected later this year. ___ AP writer Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea contributed to this report.",World/Associated Press,Japan says disputed islands 'illegally occupied by Russia',https://news.yahoo.com/japan-says-disputed-islands-illegally-111711150.html
4/22/2022,"McConnell was ready to vote to convict Trump of inciting the Capitol riot, a forthcoming book says. But the Senate GOP leader backed down after realizing most of his caucus wasn't on board, it adds. ""I didn't get to be leader by voting with five people in the conference,"" he said, per the book. Despite leaning toward convicting former President Donald Trump of incitement of an insurrection following the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell later backed down after realizing that his Republican colleagues weren't on the same page. That's according to an excerpt published Thursday from ""This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden, and the Battle for America's Future,"" a forthcoming book from the New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns. ""If this isn't impeachable, I don't know what is,"" he told two longtime advisors over a Chick-fil-A lunch in Kentucky on January 10, 2021, the book says. McConnell also believed, it adds, that a conviction vote for Trump would be bipartisan and that it may even be enough to bar Trump from holding public office again. That would've required a 67-vote majority in the Senate, meaning 17 Republicans would've had to join all 50 Democrats in voting to convict Trump for inciting an insurrection. Ultimately, just seven Republicans did so. According to the book, both Republican Sens. John Thune of South Dakota and Rob Portman of Ohio told close confidants that McConnell was leaning toward voting to convict Trump, and even the Democratic Senate leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, thought he might go that way. ""I don't trust him, and I would not count on it,"" Schumer told leaders of liberal advocacy groups, according to the book. ""But you never know."" But McConnell quickly realized that the rest of his caucus did not feel the same way, the book says, and many Republicans began to argue that impeaching a former president was not appropriate. ""I didn't get to be leader by voting with five people in the conference,"" McConnell told a friend, the book says. McConnell ultimately voted against convicting Trump on February 13, 2021, despite blaming him for the attack. ""There is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor that day. ""The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president. In that same speech, McConnell repeated the very same argument put forward by his Republican colleagues — that a former president cannot and should not face conviction from the Senate. ""If President Trump were still in office, I would have carefully considered whether the House managers proved their specific charge,"" he said. ""But in this case, that question is moot. Because former President Trump is constitutionally not eligible for conviction."" The following month, McConnell told Fox News he would ""absolutely"" support Trump if he were to become the Republican nominee once again. —Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) February 25, 2021 In an interview earlier this month with Jonathan Swan of Axios, McConnell said he's obliged to support whomever GOP voters picked as their presidential nominee. ""I think I have an obligation to support the nominee of my party,"" McConnell said. ""That will mean that whoever the nominee is has gone out and earned the nomination."" He added: ""I don't get to pick the Republican nominee for president. They're elected by the Republican voters all over the country.""

4/22/2022,"Local journalism like this needs your support. Consider subscribing to your local newspaper. See our current offers. Even if you’ve been deep inside Space Mountain for the past few weeks, you might have heard the intense rumblings emanating from the feud between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and The Walt Disney Co, which the governor has blasted as a “woke corporation.” Then again, you probably didn’t pay it much attention, just like the thousands of others queued ear-to-ear for Magic Kingdom fireworks on a Friday night, or waiting to meet a Disney princess, or trying to get a required park reservation at The Most Magical Place on Earth. The iconic company's four Orlando-area theme parks are teeming with guests. Additionally, vacationers board Disney Cruise Line's two largest cruise ships — the Dream and the Fantasy — for sailings from Port Canaveral a total of three times a week. ""Disney is very much loved by people in this country. Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, the Seven Dwarfs and Cinderella are all part of Disney lore,"" said Abraham Pizam, the founding dean of Rosen College of Hospitality Management at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. ""Disney has permeated our culture. It is an entertainment giant. If I were in the shoes of Disney, I would not be worried."" Who is Randy Fine? Republican lawmaker's fight with Disney is only his latest battle in culture wars Lawmakers revoke Disney's status: A smaller world for Disney? Florida lawmakers revoke special self-governing status How is Disney responding? Here's what Disney has said so far about the political storm surrounding it The rumble in a nutshell: This week, the Florida Legislature voted to repeal the Reedy Creek Improvement District, the governing structure for Disney's Florida properties (which has about $1 billion of municipal bond debt), a move viewed as punishment against Disney for speaking out against the ""Parental Rights in Education Act."" The law limits instruction about gender identity and sexual orientation in grades K-3. Disney CEO Bob Chapek said the media giant was pausing political contributions in the state and working to overturn the law, dubbed by critics the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill. “If Disney wants to pick a fight, they chose the wrong guy,” DeSantis said in a fundraising email. The measure to strip Disney of its self-governing power was introduced in the Florida House by Brevard County Republican lawmaker Randy Fine. The change would take effect in June 2023. The political battle has prompted considerable social media chatter on both sides — but it doesn't appear to be impacting the Disney magic, judging by attendance. Take as an example: Even if you're a passholder with the top-tier annual pass and no blackout dates, reservations can be hard to come by. As of Wednesday, the last week of April had limited openings, and so did spots in May and early June. And that's also amid some non-political grumbling by consumers over ticket prices being higher than pre-COVID, and a halt on new passes that some in Florida complained favor visitors from out of state over residents and passholders. Any financial impact from the Legislature's action would likely come later, and be felt by local taxpayers and the company as Disney must navigate new rules to add attractions. In discussing the political battle, for now, ""I don't see it changing guests' habits,"" said Scott Sanders, founder and operator of the Disney Cruise Line Blog — which is not affiliated with Disney. Sanders — a Walt Disney World annual passholder who visits the theme parks with his family several times a month — doesn't see any evidence that people are staying away from the parks. From his experience, the attractions, shops and restaurants are as busy as they've always been. ""It seems like Disney is too big to topple,"" he said. If there's a group of people talking Disney World online, you'll often see someone add the four-word refrain: ""The magic is gone."" Feedback about changes over the past few years has been brutal and constant on Disney World-centric Facebook pages. Shifting ships: Disney Dream leaving Port Canaveral this summer Higher prices, and the loss of perks like free Fast Passes for quicker access to popular attractions at Walt Disney World, irked many people — and many see this news-grabbing political war as something Disney shouldn't be involved in, period. Does it mean they plan to cancel trips or boycott the company? Karen Fernandez of Happy Trails in Kissimmee agrees with DeSantis' stance when it comes to the Parental Rights law, saying she thinks kids in kindergarten through third grade ""should be learning reading, writing, arithmetic. They should talk to their parents about the other stuff."" But she sees Disney's side, too, and says of the governing structure battle, ""This whole fight is ridiculous."" ""It's not going to stop me from going to Disney, even if they raise prices because of the Reedy Creek deal going off, if I can afford it,"" said Fernandez, who was 4 on her first trip to Disney World in 1974. ""It's my escape,"" Fernandez said. ""I go there to ride rides, to watch shows. I go there to meet family and friends. Nothing political or religious, if religion was brought into it, would stop me from going there. The magic some say is gone … it depends on what they feel the magic is. Is it getting free stuff, or enjoying yourself, watching shows, riding rides, laughing, eating delicious food? Things change. And people have to adapt to the new changes. Walt Disney was a very creative person. … Maybe he would have had a different approach, but things would have changed anyway."" Pizam, who currently serves as professor and Linda Chapin Eminent Scholar Chair in tourism management at UCF, said he believes any efforts to boycott Disney for its stances could be offset by Disney supporters making a special effort to frequent Disney venues and buy Disney products and services. While the theme parks are one-of-a-kind, when it comes to cruises, consumers have a plethora of choices. That's where an impact might be seen first. But there's no indication yet that consumers are cooling on Disney. During March, the Disney Fantasy had four sailings out of Port Canaveral, averaging 2,316 passengers per sailing, or about 93% of the ship's double-occupancy capacity of 2,500. The Disney Dream had eight sailings out of Port Canaveral, averaging 2,209 passengers per sailing, or about 88% of its double-occupancy capacity of 2,500. Passenger counts were up from February, when the Fantasy was averaging 1,775 passengers per sailing and the Dream was averaging 1,659. But they are not necessarily at pre-pandemic levels, as cruise lines are seeking to limit their bookings to help in social distancing. Because of the large number of children on a Disney sailing, its ships have three of four passengers in many cabins, and the Dream and Fantasy can sail with as many as 4,000 passengers. In March 2019, for example, the Fantasy was averaging 3,884 passengers per sailing and the Dream was averaging 3,764. Melbourne resident Carolyn Perrine, who's sailed with Disney 10 times, has taken two cruises already this year — one with her husband and one solo — and has another planned for September. If anything, the political situation is making her more loyal to Disney, reinforcing her love of the brand and appreciation for what the company is standing up for, Perrine said. ""The fact they have not kowtowed to the Republicans, that they're standing up for people without a voice. … I like that,"" she said. ""They're standing up for their employees, not just passholders. And I think all this talk of boycotts, all of that, is just noise. They're still so busy, and I hope they continue to have that experience."" Canaveral Port Authority Commissioner and Secretary/Treasurer Robyn Hattaway, a resident of Merritt Island, said she is not overly concerned about any efforts by cruise-goers opposed to Disney's political stance to boycott Disney Cruise Line. Hattaway — an attorney, who also is a Republican candidate for the Florida House of Representatives in 2022 — noted that there are four other cruise lines sailing from Port Canaveral, which is the world's second-busiest cruise port, based on passenger volume. Hattaway said someone not wanting to book a Disney cruise could always choose to sail on one of the other line's ships that are based at Port Canaveral. ""I certainly respect people's opinions,"" Hattaway said. Looking ahead, though, consumers might see some impact from the Reedy Creek decision. Pizam said Disney could face potential roadblocks for getting approval for future expansion projects at its theme parks or other facilities. Such approval might be required to come from the county governments in Orange or Osceola counties. Additionally, the two counties could be financially impacted by taking responsibility for the roads, other infrastructure and public safety within the current Reedy Creek boundaries. ""Unfortunately, the whole thing is not good for both sides,"" Pizam said. And the dispute has certainly seeped into discussions about Disney, which previously had seemed eager to be seen as above politics. Caroline Marianek of Fleming Island loves Disney World, and has bought annual passes for herself, her husband and their son for most of the past 15 years. But Disney’s failure to come out early against the so-called Don’t Say Gay bill left her infuriated, she said. “Disney should be the ultimate place of inclusivity. Yes, I have read the bill. Just because it doesn’t say those words directly, it is still the spirit of the bill,” she said. “As the proud mother of a gay son, I was so deeply hurt that Disney not only refused to come out against it, but that they financially supported candidates that proposed it. For a good 72 hours, I would have answered that there is no way I was renewing. I still say they did too little, too late."" A view about the conflict: Torres: DeSantis vs. Disney is such a useless fight over a ridiculous law | Opinion When it comes time to renew in July, Marianek said, she’ll have a big decision to make. Disney is not her husband's thing, she said, and her son now is a college student in Texas. Between higher prices and the loss of spontaneity due to the reservation system, Marianek would agree with many that ""Disney has made it harder to want to continue being a passholder.” “The amount of visit break-even point is getting harder to meet,” she said. And yet, she won't rule out future visits. “With all that being said, the minute I pull onto Disney property and see those signs, the weight of the world is lifted off my shoulders,” she said. “No matter what is going on around me, I am thrilled to be ‘home’ again.” Contact Kennerly at bkennerly@floridatoday.com.
