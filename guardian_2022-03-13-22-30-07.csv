3/13/2022,"This week’s Saturday Night Live opens with a national security briefing at the White House. To address the increased prevalence of TikTok as an information source for Ukrainians under attack from Russia, President Joe Biden (James Austin Johnson) and Press Secretary Jen Psaki (Kate McKinnon) welcome several prominent content creators from the platform. Biden is desperate for their help, admitting “I understand Putin. I understand war. But there’s one thing I don’t understand: computer.” The Tik Tokers, include an actor from the CW (Chloe Fineman), a rapper/prankster (Andrew Dismukes), singer and dancer Jason Derulo (Chris Redd), an alt-right child make-up artist (Aidy Bryant), a “random middle-aged guy” named Charles F D’Amelio (Kenan Thompson) who the White House confused with teenage influencer Charli D’Amelio, and a guy who does stunts with a toilet plunger stuck to his nipple (Bowen Yang). Their advice on how to win the information war against Russia involves reading awful poetry, pushing Vladimir Putin down a flight of stairs and sending a roofer to assassinate him. As bad a cold open as the show has done this season, this sketch is as facile and obnoxious as the social media personalities it’s attempting to ridicule. It’s also yet another example of SNL scraping the bottom of the barrel by simply regurgitating other people’s (bad) material. It’s unclear whether the show is attempting to make its audience laugh, or just clap like trained seals because they recognize the various references. Zoë Kravitz hosts for the first time. The actor, currently starring as Catwoman in The Batman, is almost immediately interrupted by McKinnon, dressed up in the risqué latex costume that Michelle Pfieffer wore in her outing as the iconic anti-hero. McKinnon mugs it up while introducing the “Cat Signal”, which brings out a rogues gallery of other feline-centric characters, including Eartha Kitt (Ego Nwodim) as the campy Catwoman from the ‘60s Batman TV show, a mentally unbalanced New York City “cat lady” (Bryant), and obnoxious stand-up comic Katt Williams (Redd). Kravitz plays the straight man for all of it, ceding pretty much the entirety of her monologue to others. This is followed by a wedding reception in which Kravitz play the maid of honor. Her toast gets off to a weird start with the casual mention that both she and the bride (Cecily Strong) have seen her dad naked, before going even further sideways as she remembers reveals the depths of her friend’s insanity and depravity, which includes a history of hate crimes (“She’s been a bit of a Bridezilla, and not just because she’s attacked a lot of Japanese people”), a string of dead boyfriends (“If nine of my last boyfriends killed themselves, I’d give up on romance. But not Tanya!”) and a sexual history with “the whole Jackass gang”. The rapid-fire jokes and escalation of insanity, combined with the befuddled reactions from Kyle Mooney’s doomed groom and a quick, funny appearance from Martin Herlihy make it clear that this sketch was penned by the Please Don’t Destroy guys. A commercial for Amazon Go attempts to sell the convenience of their “grab and go” model, but it is met with skepticism from Black shoppers, all of whom fear a trap. Then, awkward high school nerd Josh (McKinnon) attempts to woo the popular girl in his class with the help of his equally nerdy friend (Bryant). Despite his awkwardness and against all odds, he manages to seal the deal. It’s unclear what the joke is supposed to be here – at times, the sketch plays like a send-up of Nasa mission control room movie scenes, but it never fully leans into that idea. In a scene from Disney’s The Princess and the Frog, Kravitz’s Princess is all set to plant a kiss on Redd’s Frog, until he reveals that “frogs don’t have a penis”. When she asks how his species has sex, he describes the process with the help of some graphic metaphors: “Who needs a straw when I can just throw the milkshake right in your face?” There are some decent lines throughout, but they can’t salvage how random and dated the whole thing is. What exactly is the point of parodying a moderately popular kid’s movie from 13 years ago? A new Please Don’t Destroy video sees the guys hoping to surprise Kravitz by gifting her a kitten (“We thought it would be funny to get Catwoman a woman cat!”). However, they quickly lose the animal in their office (a place ungoverned by the rules of space, time or reason). Chaos ensues. Of late, the PDD segments have suffered from a little too much celebrity involvement (along with Kravitz, the crew is joined by her Batman costar Paul Dano, who’s living under the couch while researching an upcoming role in a movie “about three guys who suck”). The dynamic work best when it’s just Ben, John and Martin. That said, this one is still enjoyably anarchic, overflowing with the cartoon logic that make these sketches so enjoyable. And to be fair, Dano’s weirdo energy makes him a pretty good fit. Next, a mother and her kids watch some of their dad’s old home movies, only to discover a secret tape he recorded in the event of his death. In it, he confesses that he’s flat broke from blowing “his money on JB Smoove’s new sports betting app”, is in terrible health (“I haven’t drank a glass of water since 2003”), and has a secret daughter from donating sperm. It ends with him pitching his idea for a terrible movie idea called Dallas City Bouncers. It all goes on far too long, but Thompson’s performance as the dopey patriarch makes it worth the while, especially when he has to act like he’s being fast forwarded. On Weekend Update, Colin Jost spoils for direct American intervention in Ukraine, saying “I’ve honestly thought about marching down to the nearest Army enlistment office and signing Che up.” A little later, he invites on film critic Terry Fink (Alex Moffat) to give his Oscar predictions. As in his previous appearances, the cheerful Fink has a hard time keeping the movies straight due to his liberal intake of hallucinogens (“The LSD helps me L-S-See all these terrific films!”). He gives deranged recaps of several of the nominees, including The Power of the Dog (“Benedict Cumberbatch rides high as the titular Dog the Bounty Hunter”) Encanto (“Feels worse than being on fire”) and Belfast (“Get the tissues ready as Johnny Knoxville and his band of idiots bop around town and torture each other’s balls in this Troubles-era tearjerker”). Moffat’s unhinged performance – particularly a prolonged existential breakdown that he sells entirely with facial expression – might be the best he’s ever given. Then, Michael Che invites on lifestyle influencer Dan Bulldozer – Mooney, decked out in a ridiculously bulky muscle suit and fake beard, his voice made extra-deep with the help of a modifier – who brags about his flashy lifestyle and promotes his forthcoming book (“It’s like Hemingway, but for guys”). Asked how he maintains a down-to-earth attitude, he attempts to answer by way of a long-winded parable about a farmer and his three daughters, but he loses the thread. So too does the bit, although it’s nice to see Mooney get the spotlight, as he’s been noticeably sparse these past couple of months. Word Crunch is a game show where contestants have to find the words hidden in a letter puzzle. Kravitz’s contestant keeps guessing the word “Momhole”, before moving on to a full litany of filthy guesses. It’s a one-joke sketch, but Dismukes is very good as the flustered host. Things close out with a sketch about Bowen Yang obsessing over a high school marching band’s version of Don’t Stop Believing. He becomes violently emotional when he plays the song, singing, screaming, dancing and yelling about Mario Kart. It’s all as tired, annoying and endless as Don’t Stop Believing itself. Like last week’s episode, this outing had its ups and downs, although there were more downs this time around. Kravitz played things safe by mostly keeping to straight man roles, giving the actual cast all the opportunity to shine. Some of them – Moffatt, Thompson, Dismukes, the PDD guys – made the most of it. Others – McKinnon and Yang – not so much. The biggest takeaway remains SNL’s utter inability to mine anything remotely funny from social media. They need to put a pin in that ASAP.",Arts/Television & radio,Saturday Night Live: Zoë Kravitz plays it straight in another uneven episode,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/13/saturday-night-live-zoe-kravitz
3/13/2022,"Calls for a legal pardon for the thousands of people persecuted as witches in post-Reformation Scotland are growing, as the drive for posthumous justice gains international notice. Last week, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, issued a formal apology on International Women’s Day to the 4,000 people, mainly women, who were tortured and often horribly executed under the Witchcraft Act 1563. Now campaigners have pledged to maintain momentum amid plans to educate a new generation of schoolchildren about this historic campaign of femicide and create a national monument to those ordinary people whose lives were ripped apart. In her apology, Sturgeon emphasised that the deep misogyny motivating this “colossal” injustice was something women still lived with. Mindful of present-day resonances, grassroots projects are springing up across Scotland to discover more about the women who were wrongly accused of witchcraft and to memorialise them. “There’s lots more to do,” said Claire Mitchell QC, who established the Witches of Scotland campaign in 2020, before bringing a petition seeking apology and pardon, as well as a national memorial, before the Holyrood parliament earlier this year. “We’re keen to get the pardon because it marks a legal status change. It’s important for any human to be properly recorded in history.” The SNP MSP Natalie Don is bringing a members’ bill for a pardon, with the consultation to launch imminently. The first minister’s statement was “massive”, said Sara Kelly of the charity Remembering the Accused Witches of Scotland (RAWS). Set up in 2019, RAWS has also approached the Church of Scotland for an apology and has ambitious plans to offer education packs to all schools in Scotland. The charity is also pressing for both national and community memorialising: most recently a street in St Monans was renamed after Maggie Morgan, who was accused of witchcraft after giving birth to an illegitimate child fathered by the son of an influential Fife family. Kelly points to a swell of grassroots groups researching local prosecutions. “The scale of persecution was incredible,” she said, with Scotland carrying out five times the European average of executions per capita. She added: “And it’s not really talked about in local communities. It makes you look at the place you live in a different way and ask if that discrimination still happens now in other forms.” Mairi Harkness is part of one such project in West Lothian, aiming to uncover more about five women from the parish of Calder who were strangled then burned at the stake. “Prosecutions for witchcraft may seem far removed from our lives now, but we believe this offers an opportunity to better understand issues that still affect us today,” she said. “In the UK stereotypical expectations about how men and woman should act persist, we still see outspoken women viewed and treated harshly and women are still expected to mitigate their behaviour to protect themselves from male violence. Globally people are persecuted for witchcraft and women often disproportionately suffer the consequences of religious extremism.” The historian Mary W Craig, who recently published a study of witch trials in the Scottish Borders, believes the fate of accused witches has pricked the public conscience over the past three years because of a combination of factors. “With the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, people also wanted to talk about the levels of historic justice available to different groups,” she said. Meanwhile, the academic appetite for further research is deepening, with the University of Edinburgh advertising for two interns to work on the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft, a database of known prosecutions and one of the most comprehensive in Europe. Continued academic inquiry is essential to acknowledge past atrocities and for greater perspective on our modern behaviours, says Michelle Brock, an associate professor of history at Washington and Lee University in the US. In 2017, Brock wrote for the Washington Post, explaining the historical incongruence of claims that powerful men such as Harvey Weinstein were subject to a witch-hunt, when in reality these persecutions targeted marginalised people and brutally enforced gender hierarchies. “In examining events like the great witch-hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries, we get a window into the tremendous power of things like belief, fear, propaganda, gender norms and reputation. This is a critical reminder for us not to be overly confident or complacent in the ‘rightness’ and ‘rationality’ of our own time, because without doubt we believe things and commit acts today that, 400 years from now, people will find as shocking as we do the witch-hunts.”",News/UK news,Calls for Scotland to pardon witch-hunt victims gather pace,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/13/calls-scotland-pardon-witch-hunt-victims-gather-pace
3/13/2022,"Ihave an old US copy of one of my favourite books as a child: The Dark Is Rising by Susan Cooper. The edition is illustrated by Alan E Cober – dark, fantastical pencil drawings that bring Cooper’s winter world to life. The best of these sketches is of the mythical figure of Herne the Hunter, a weird and warped creature with the antlers of a stag sitting astride a horse. Herne leads his wild hunt through the final pages of the book, a riot of raucous energy that brings the novel to its stunning conclusion. Now Zoe Gilbert, author of a wonderfully strange collection of confected myths in her debut, Folk, has made Herne the hero of her second book. It is – follow closely here – purportedly an academic collection of writings about Herne, from his 14th-century life as the favoured huntsman of Richard II to his dystopian appearance in the late 21st century. It opens with a convincingly po-faced introduction by a (fictional) professor, who writes of the way that science and enlightenment thought have elbowed the “rascally psychopomp” Herne out of the national consciousness. Now Gilbert’s stories re-accommodate him as the sometimes shadowy representation of a peculiarly British strain of weirdness and wildness. These tales are as much about place as about their carnivalesque central character. Herne’s death and resurrection as part-man, part-beast was supposed to have happened in the Great North Wood, the forest whose vestiges may still be found in some areas of south London (and in the names of Norwood, Forest Hill and Honor Oak). The book traces the evolution of the city, the diminution of the wood, over the course of centuries, suggesting that echoes of the wild wood may still be heard in the contemporary (and futuristic) streets of Croydon and Penge. British folk tales have undergone a renaissance in recent years – witness the success of communities such as #FolkloreThursday on Twitter, the presence of folkloric tropes in the work of writers such as Andrew Michael Hurley, Sarah Perry and Sarah Moss, and the rediscovery of classic novels by Susan Cooper, Alan Garner and Robert Holdstock. In Mischief Acts, Gilbert has created a novel that is part of this movement and entirely sui generis. Weaving together prose and poetry, myth and history, the past, present and future, it’s a work of extraordinary ambition, brilliantly realised.

3/13/2022,"Since the 2015 release of his mixtape Bcos U Will Never B Free, Surrey singer-songwriter Alexander O’Connor, AKA Rex Orange County, has proved his knack for creating succinct bedroom pop whose youthful optimism is so vibrant as to sometimes verge on the saccharine. That sweetness was the perfect accompaniment for the acerbic introspection of US rapper Tyler, the Creator’s 2017 album Flower Boy, on which O’Connor provided multiple features, but the British artist has since struggled to establish a sound of his own that can carry a listener’s attention through repeated plays. His latest fourth record, Who Cares?, finds O’Connor in somewhat better shape. Reuniting with songwriter Benny Sings, who provided one of his most popular singles in 2017’s Loving Is Easy, the pair produce 11 tracks of earworming hooks. Highlights include the hip-swaying funk of The Shade, a gravelly guest verse from Tyler on Open a Window, and the forlorn strings of Amazing. Taken as a whole, though, Who Cares? is so unvarying in its sentimental melodies that it begins to fade into the background, so unobtrusive that it becomes unremarkable. Perhaps if O’Connor finds some darkness within his earnestness there would be a depth worth coming back to.",Arts/Music,"Rex Orange County: Who Cares? review – sweet, unremarkable bedroom pop",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/13/rex-orange-county-who-cares-review
3/13/2022,"Everyone knows Robert Indiana’s most famous work – Love. Just that one word, spelled out in two tiers of red letters, against blue and green, the work is nonetheless more than just this syllable. The lovely round O – touched by the L, carried by the bracing E – swoons and leans, as if it has been knocked sideways by the force of love. It takes on a bodily form. Indiana (1928-2018) created this pure and concentrated pictogram in his late thirties. Originally commissioned as a Christmas card for MoMA, it became an oil painting and then many more paintings, a sculpture then many more sculptures. And so the proliferation continues. What was first an emblem for hippies, Love became a symbol for Americans protesting against race riots, Vietnam and civil injustice. You might say the noun turned into a verb. But by 1973, the original icon – which made Indiana little money, because he never took out a copyright – had become so popular the US mail turned it into a cute little stamp. And now it has devolved back into a parody of what it once was: an infinitely recognisable greetings card. At Yorkshire Sculpture Park, however, you see Love redeemed, brought back to life in works of art. It first appears as a giant aluminium sculpture, almost cuboid, on the brow of a hill, the shining red letters painted green and blue inside. Later it doubles, like a Rorschach of itself, the two Os now leaning outwards like wings. And in the Bothy Garden, in Corten steel, it grows to the size of a massive filigree wall, with four Os now appearing clustered together in the centre like the petals of a flower. The variations are simple, concise and epigrammatic; love takes flight, and so on. The colours are the original trio; and it is moving to learn that the red and green were from a petrol sign that dominated Indiana’s childhood, both geographically during the many restless trips his family took, and because his father worked for the company. The blue represents the high skies of Indiana. Born Robert Clark, the artist took the surname Indiana in homage to his home state, endlessly crisscrossed during a childhood of poverty and divorce. After national service he moved to New York where he fell in love with the painter Ellsworth Kelly. Indiana’s admiration for his fellow American artists is everywhere apparent in this exhibition, which includes paintings as well as many other sculptures. There are homages to the gay painter Marsden Hartley and his love for a German army officer who died in the opening weeks of the first world war. Charles Demuth’s scintillating masterpiece I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold is the basis for many of Indiana’s own number paintings. And one of the 30 or so towering wooden columns here, all so anthropomorphic, is crowned with the pitchfork from Grant Wood’s American Gothic. These wooden assemblages began small, originally shorter than Indiana. He hacked them together out of beams from old Dutch warehouses on the Manhattan docks. The brass stencils he found there, too, became a fixed component of his style. The name Icarus is stencilled on one of these herms, as he called them, bearing impotent rusting flywheels for wings and a head of downcast chains. Ahab appears stencilled on another, a dark stump with startling white discs for eyes. The columns grow taller and more magnificent. Metal plates cast shadows that double as facial expressions. The skulls of buffalos turn them into prairie totems. Indiana was routinely pegged as a pop artist, not least because of Andy Warhol’s film of him eating a single mushroom with comic slowness (screening in the final gallery). But this show – the first devoted to his art in the UK – reveals a much more nostalgic and even sorrowful cast of mind. Confederate flags, lone stars, the rusting detritus of desolate farms on wide agrarian landscapes: the sculptures are shot through with Americana. And the most affecting works appear to commemorate his long-lost parents. His mother was always trying to make the world right through cooking, and her last word was apparently “Eat”. To Eat and Hug, Indiana adds the words Die and Err, in paintings and illuminated signs, a brusque summary of American life. A particularly poignant column, standing about human height, has the words My Mother stencilled in white round and round it, in such subtle configurations that you are always trying to make out both words, the full being, as it were, to catch a glimpse. Just occasionally it all becomes possible. But that it can also go awry shows just how perilous Indiana’s matrix of words, colours, numbers and forms can be. He reprised the Love sculpture with a European version – Amor, where the letter O is on the bottom line, in dangerous and uncomfortable collapse. And while some of the longer word works have the same potency as the short – Love Is God, a sign piece made for a former church – the more directly political he becomes, the more ineffective because long-winded. Popularity, and ubiquity, brought Indiana some critical disdain. There are those who find his one-word utterances glib. But to see his work laid out like this, from its bright joy to its ambiguity, commemoration and lament, is to see him as a far more complicated mind – somewhere between concrete poet and artist. A pageant of sculpted numbers – 1-9, ending in zero – runs down a long Edwardian hedged avenue at Yorkshire Sculpture Park. Each is painted in two brilliant colours. Number 1 is his trademark red and blue, and very soon it becomes apparent that the numbers must be autobiographical. Still jubilant at 3, in a luminous orange; growing a little bluer by seven. The last 0 – which might be both the number, or the letter from Love – is evidently life’s end, a silver-grey vision of a fade-out.

3/13/2022,"First it was Brexit, followed by a spurt of very successful campaigning to ensure that Britain left Europe on the most stringent and self-harming terms. For a while, Nigel Farage then opposed Covid restrictions. Now, he is reviving his old hostility to action on the climate emergency, with a new vehicle called Britain Means Business, which has spawned a campaign called Vote Power Not Poverty. Both were recently launched by an article in the Mail on Sunday. “Net zero is net stupid,” wrote Farage, who drew a line from the government’s green targets to the rising cost of living and made the case not just for a referendum on the issue, but also the return of fracking and coal-mining. Later this month, alongside his close ally Richard Tice and the local Tory MP, Farage was meant to be the star of an anti-net zero rally at Whites Hotel in Bolton, Greater Manchester, built into the home ground of Bolton Wanderers FC. Their putative hosts soon announced that the event was “not something the club and business wishes to be associated with”, and pulled the plug: a “Moscow-style rebuke to free speech”, said the organisers. But, as it turned out, this was an irrelevant blip. The event is now happening at another venue, and besides, Boris Johnson is reportedly set to review the current moratorium on fracking – “the first victory for common sense,” says Farage – as part of plans to increase the UK’s production of oil and gas. Johnson’s pretext is Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and what it means for the UK and Europe’s energy security – but he is clearly responding to months of pressure on net zero from the political right, both inside and outside the Conservative party. Brexit was its defining big win; now it has its eyes on another. In the midst of the Ukraine crisis, there is a comfy and complacent view around that the links between rightwing populists and Putin will hasten their downfall. It’s an idea symbolised by the Italian politician Matteo Salvini’s public shaming for his pro-Putin posturing on a visit to the Polish-Ukrainian border, and Marine Le Pen’s shredding of leaflets featuring an image of her alongside the Russian president. These people do indeed look suddenly wrongfooted and nervous – but Farage and his allies play by a different set of rules, partly because they do not have to worry about parliamentary representation and any aspiration to power (and, therefore, responsibility). Because they have been shut out by our electoral system, they long ago developed a much craftier and more light-footed way of operating: making as much noise as possible outside the normal structures of power and politics while encouraging rebellious Tories, and thereby putting continual pressure on the Conservative party via its right flank.The result is a transformation of Tory politics that is still too little understood. A loose but hugely influential hard-right coalition has cohered, buoyed up by our exit from the EU, and now determined to use questions about living costs and energy security to destroy any meaningful prospect of climate action. In parliament, some of its key voices congregate around such Conservative MPs as Steve Baker and Mark Harper, who are responsible for an ever-evolving list of bodies including the European Research Group and the Net Zero Scrutiny Group (and, like Farage, well aware that you can wield power without having to worry about accountability). In the cabinet, their ideological torch is carried by such ministers as Priti Patel, Nadine Dorries, and Jacob Rees-Mogg. But the new right’s key element is a political faction outside the party walls, with a very modern grasp of how 21st-century politics works. Farage remains this element’s unchallenged leader and figurehead: its clout is based on agile organising skills and handsome funds, a constant platform in the rightwing press, a big presence on social media – and now, the TV channel GB News. (Its viewing figures belie the channel’s significance: it exists chiefly as a source of endless clips that are spread on social media, in which dubious and toxic opinions – not least about Russia and Ukraine – are presented in the same context as mainstream news, and thereby normalised.)Faced with a prime minister as weak and biddable as Boris Johnson, all these people know that their key task is a kind of elevated trolling. In byelections, the latest Farage vehicle need only get a relative handful of votes to jangle Tory nerves: back in December, when Tice and the new Reform party got a mere 6.6% of the vote at Bexley and Old Sidcup, the Spectator’s Katy Balls wrote in the Guardian that his performance highlighted fears among ministers “that a party will emerge that will outflank them on the right”. Those anxieties inform a huge chunk of policy. Farage’s return to politics, let us not forget, was presaged by all the noise he made about people crossing the Channel: now, even as he tells his GB News viewers that he is “open-minded and open-hearted” about people fleeing Ukraine, the government’s cruel treatment of Ukrainian refugees is partly based on fear of how much noise the post-Brexit right would make if Britain did the correct thing and followed the open-door lead set by the EU. In keeping with the old rules of politics, a lumbering, hidebound Labour party still focuses just about all its energies on attacking the Conservative leadership. But Johnson and his allies are actually downstream of the new right, much as the traditional US Republican party is now subservient to a political movement that began well outside the political mainstream. Indeed, by the time the government announces its latest policy shift, it is usually too late: the work has been done elsewhere, by people and forces that Labour barely acknowledges. Worse still, there is a constant sense that Farage and his allies’ portrayal of kind of Brexit-supporting voters concentrated in so-called red wall seats also exerts a strong pull on Keir Starmer and his colleagues. Who does Farage actually speak for? Even in England, his base probably amounts to no more than five to 10% of the population. To some extent, his career represents a rearguard action against the fact that social conservatism and belligerent nationalism – along with climate scepticism – find increasingly little echo among younger people, and for reasons that have more to do with demography than politics, their appeal will, sooner or later, start to wane. I have been to enough Farage events to know his people by sight: a passionate and fearful crowd, disproportionately male, and often well-versed in the vocabulary of conspiracy theories. Even if their views blur into a much bigger mess of fear, insecurity and prejudice, that should not blind anyone to how out-there they are, and how straightforwardly Farage’s transparent opportunism could be taken down. But seemingly for fear of giving him even more publicity, even as Brexit’s failures and lies pile up, he is largely left alone. In that sense, his success says as much about his opponents as it does about him. Indeed, those of us who would like a kinder, better country than the one he claims to speak for perhaps have a lot to learn from his methods, as last week’s events prove. If net zero is to happen, its complexities and challenges will have to be explained to a lot more people than the comparative few who have so far bought into the idea. And in that sense, even if Farage’s rally ran into trouble, it highlighted a very telling question: for all their zeal and righteousness, when was the last time that people who support net zero organised a big event in Bolton?

3/13/2022,"Nazis, genocide, Nato, history: Russia has no shortage of apparent justifications for its war in Ukraine. But are any of them valid? Were Russian speakers endangered in the country’s east? Is Nato’s expansion a material threat to Moscow? Were there cliques of neo-Nazis running amok in Ukraine? We assess whether Russia’s claims justify the invasion of a sovereign country. Since 1991, Nato has absorbed 11 eastern European countries and three former Soviet republics. Even before Vladimir Putin became president in 2000, Russia took a dim view of this. Some say assurances were given to the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, that Nato wouldn’t move an inch farther east after German reunification in 1990. But this is hotly disputed. Russia’s logic here is shaped by history. “The Russian historical view is that every hundred years or so there’s an invasion from the west,” said Tomas Ries, associate professor at the Swedish defence university. “From a Russian military perspective, I can understand that they were worried when Nato was enlarged,” he said, adding nonetheless: “The problem with this argument is that no one in their wildest dreams can imagine the west attacking Russia.” Then there is the position of the newly independent states that joined Nato. “This wasn’t Nato trying to enlarge, this was countries hammering on the door saying let us in,” Ries said. “From our worldview, these are small countries that have good reason to be afraid of Russia.” Was Russia justified in worrying that Ukraine might join Nato? Not really, said Kristin Bakke, a professor in political science at UCL. “For a long time, support for Nato membership in Ukraine was about 30 to 40%,” she notes, adding that far more people wanted simply to remain neutral. It wasn’t until last year that surveys showed more than half of Ukrainians wanting Nato membership. And by the time 100,000 Russian troops had amassed on the border, that number had risen to close to 60%. It was the startling flight of Viktor Yanukovych from office, after weeks of demonstrations in Kyiv by pro-western protesters in 2014, that accelerated the crisis in Ukraine. Yanukovych favoured closer ties with Russia. Protesters on Maidan square in central Kyiv wanted Ukraine to join the EU. Western powers naturally sympathised with the protesters, but there is no evidence that this movement was anything other than an expression of discontent with an unpopular leader. “I had friends on Maidan,” said Gustav Gessel, a Berlin-based fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “It was neither an assembly of Nazis, nor made by the CIA. It started as a student protest.” After Russia seized Crimea and supported a secessionist war in eastern Ukraine in 2014 after Yanukovych’s removal, a peace deal of sorts was hammered out in Minsk, under Franco-German mediation. The agreement provided for a ceasefire, withdrawal of heavy weaponry, and constitutional reform granting a measure of autonomy to the Donbas republics seeking secession. But implementation was patchy, with violations on both sides. International monitors had a hard time accessing the separatist republics. Valerie Morkevičius, an expert in the ethics of conflict at Colgate University, New York, said Ukraine did engage in a process of decentralisation, but not to the degree that the Minsk Agreement intended. “The Ukrainians say that would have privileged the Donbas over the rest of Ukraine,” she said. But she added that the Minsk agreement also provided for all foreign military forces to be removed from the area. “Russia never did, but continued to deny that its forces were there.” “It smells of genocide,” Putin said in 2015, remarking on the unresolved conflict in the east. Right up until last month’s invasion, Putin insisted that Donbas residents needed military intervention to prevent their annihilation. There is no evidence for this. About 14,000 people were killed on both sides during the 2014 war (in an area then numbering about 4 million people). But deaths slowed to a trickle in the stalemate that ensued. And throughout, Morkevičius says, “there was no indication that Ukraine was targeting people for being Russian-speaking”. “The Russians say there was a genocide against the Russian population, and there is no evidence for that at all,” Ries added. It is a misunderstanding of Ukraine to imagine it split into two with Russian speakers in the east, and Ukrainian speakers in the west. In fact, most people speak both languages. And there are a multitude of other tongues protected by law as well. A new law introduced in 2019 requiring use of Ukrainian in public life and secondary education was seen as anti-Russian in Moscow. It sets Ukrainian language quotas for a range of cultural output, and is not universally popular. “It does promote the use of Ukrainian, but Russia can still be used whenever a citizen asks for it,” Morkevičius said. “Now Russian is only available as primary language through elementary school, so one could point to that and say that’s not entirely fair,” she added. “But in terms of a reason to go to war, it’s not a just cause and there’s no proportionality there.” “There are neo-Nazis in Ukraine but they are not in power, just as there are neo-Nazis in Germany but they are not in power,” said Gessel. The far right occupies fewer than 1% of seats in parliament. The president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is a Russian-speaking centrist of Jewish origin. The neo-Nazi concern almost certainly stems from the reputation of some of the volunteer brigades who fought the separatists in the 2014 war, such as the Azov battalion, which had far-right affiliations. These have since been folded into the Ukrainian national guard. Putin’s theme of fascists running wild in Ukraine is almost certainly a ploy to revive glorious memories of the “great patriotic war”. “The second world war is a very important part of Putin’s narrative,” Bakke said. “He uses the victory to mobilise people. In Ukraine at the time, there were nationalist groups fighting for Ukrainian independence against the Soviets. They came to be seen as aligned with the Nazis.” As for being drug-addled, while Ukraine does have relatively high rates of opiate abuse, UN data shows it is no worse than Russia. The Russian foreign minister, Sergeĭ Lavrov, used words to this effect on the eve of the Ukraine war, fulminating at western hypocrisy. “It’s an awkward position for the west,” said Ries. “It is true that the US and Nato have used force when they felt they needed to. Sometimes it was justified, as in the Balkans in 1995, but sometimes it very dodgy like in Iraq. From the Russian perspective, I can see how they can make that argument.” Of course, two wrongs don’t make a right. And while there are similarities between Iraq and Ukraine – invasion of sovereign territory, spurious justification, large scale civilian death, no clear plan for endgame – there are differences too. “Volodymyr Zelenskiy is a democratically elected leader, who has not committed human rights abuses,” Bakke said. “What is also different is President Putin’s stated dismissal of Ukraine’s right to exist as a sovereign state.”",News/World news,Is there any justification for Putin’s war?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/is-there-any-justification-for-putins-war
3/13/2022,"Marks & Spencer is to put Early Learning Centre toy shops and Nobody’s Child fashion into some stores in a step-up of its strategy to sell external brands and increase its appeal to families. The clothing, food and homewares retailer will open Early Learning Centre outlets, with activity tables for children as well as toys for sale, in 10 stores at the end of March, including at the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent, Longbridge in Birmingham, and Liverpool. Neil Harrison, the director of brands at M&S, said the move was part of an effort to become “more relevant more often to families” in stores, after testing Early Learning Centre products on its website. “We know a large proportion of our customers look to purchase kidswear and toys for family and friends. So, by bringing the Early Learning Centre brand – with fun and interactive experiences – to our stores, we’re able to give our 22 million customers more reasons to shop with us,” he said. M&S first began selling external brands on its website a year ago but has been experimenting with selling brands in 15 stores, including Clarks children’s shoes and Seasalt clothing for women as part of attempts to revive clothing departments by broadening its appeal. Alongside the arrival of Early Learning Centre, M&S is bringing more clothing brands into stores, more than doubling the number that sell Seasalt to 20 and taking Nobody’s Child into nine stores. The latest move will put at least one clothing or children’s toy brand into 27 UK stores. M&S has 284 clothing stores in total. Jaeger, the upmarket womenswear brand that M&S bought out of administration last year, will also be offered at several international stores. Richard Price, the managing director of M&S’s clothing & home division, said the brands could help bring in more shoppers and improve the perception of style at M&S. More than 35 brands are now on sale via M&S’s website, including Sosandar, Smiggle and Jigsaw after a first experiment with Nobody’s Child in March last year. Price said brands now represent 3.5% of M&S’s online sales, having been purchased by 1.2 million shoppers, helping to revive the group’s clothing sales. “Beyond the commercial benefits, we’re excited by the role brands can play in bringing customers into the M&S ecosystem, complementing our own-label product. Customers who buy brands not only on average spend double but return to purchase 10 days sooner. “Through Brands at M&S we’re forming deeper relationships with our customers, getting to know them better and in turn our 22 million customers are getting a richer and more seamless experience from M&S.” Last week M&S announced that Stuart Machin, the boss of its food business, would succeed Steve Rowe as CEO. Katie Bickerstaffe, who runs its clothing and home division, was named “co-CEO”, in an unusual leadership structure.",News/Business,Marks and Spencer to open Early Learning Centre outlets in stores,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/13/marks-and-spencer-to-open-early-learning-centre-outlets-in-stores
3/13/2022,"Awidowed chef from Shanghai travels with his son to a tiny town in Finland in order to pay his debt to a Finnish friend. But when nobody seems to know the man he’s looking for, Cheng (Pak Hon Chu) starts to help out in the kitchen of the failing local diner. His cooking soon wins over the grizzled locals, who hitherto regarded foreign food as a direct assault on their Finnish manhood. And his thoughtful, gentle personality captures the heart of diner owner Sirkka (Anna-Maija Tuokko). This is soupy, romantic slop from Mika Kaurismäki, the kind of photogenic sentimentality that tends to feature heavily on the menu of Lasse Hallström’s films. And yet if it’s cinematic comfort food you seek, there’s something rather soothing about this tale of a sad stranger embraced by a community who unquestioningly welcome him as one of their own.",Arts/Film,Master Cheng review – soupy tale of a Chinese chef in smalltown Finland,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/13/master-cheng-review-mika-kaurismaki-chinese-chef-finland
