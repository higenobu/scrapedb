3/11/2022,"The mysterious discovery of a mummified body in the walls of a historic convention center in Oakland, California, has prompted an urgent search for answers, as authorities seek to untangle the person’s identity and how they came to be entombed within the building’s walls. Construction workers discovered the body on Wednesday afternoon during renovations of Henry J Kaiser Convention Center, a more-than-century old building near the city’s downtown. Little is known about the person, who authorities said appears to be a man, or how he was preserved within the wall of the convention center, which has long been vacant. Officials estimate he had been there for between three and five years based on the state of decay. The victim’s body was found behind drywall and between two concrete pillars in the top-tier of the auditorium in a cavity with only a 15-inch opening, according to the Oakland police department. “Markings and biological evidence at the top of the opening indicate the victim may have been deceased near the top and over-time his body slowly decayed and slipped toward the bottom of the cavity space,” said Lt. Frederick Shavies of the Oakland police department in an official update on Thursday. An investigation and identification of the victim is still ongoing but officials determined the person was an adult male based on bone structure and anatomy. The coroner will rely on dental records, and possibly preserved fingerprints to learn who the person is, but other identifiers, including age or race, could not immediately be perceived. Shavies said that further clarification for cause of death is pending an autopsy but authorities do not at this time believe this was a homicide. “No obvious or unnatural trauma was found indicating foul play, nor were the victims hands, feet, or other body parts bound,” Shavies said, noting that the skeletal remains carried no visual signs of harm. The Henry J Kaiser Convention Center is an Oakland-designated historical landmark that opened in 1914. The auditorium was once a renowned performance space that had hosted a range of artists and speakers, including Martin Luther King Jr, Elvis Presley and the Grateful Dead. It’s sat empty in recent years, after city leaders determined it was too expensive to maintain. But in 2015, Oakland’s city council approved a plan , to reinstate the structure as a performing arts venue and commercial space. Orton Development Ltd, the company handling the renovation, declined to comment on the discovery. Officials who said initially that this was a homicide investigation reported on Thursday that it might instead have been an unfortunate mishap. “Based on the positionality the victim’s body was found in,” said Shavies, “this tragic death is most likely an accidental death caused by positional asphyxiation due to compression from the small space.”",News/US news,Mystery in Oakland after mummified body found in historic convention center,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/10/mystery-oakland-mummified-body-found-convention-center
3/11/2022,"The disastrous flooding wreaking human and environmental havoc on the east of the Australian continent is getting labelled as “unprecedented” and a once-in-a-generation or even in 1,000 years event. A thousand years. A generation. It all constitutes a lot of time on this continent in the consciousness of Australian people who come from convict/settler/colonial – or later immigrant – stock. They may have family stories, handed down through the generations of the Melbourne floods of 1934 that killed 36 people, the Brisbane floods of 1893 or even – at a stretch – the terrible Hawkesbury River deluges of 1801, 1806 and 1809. In Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ecological knowledge, family memory and sensibility – on a continent where continuous modern human habitation reaches back 60,000 years and counting – these events are effectively recent history. They have as their context tens of millennia of dramatic ecological and geological events – fires, floods, earthquakes and storms – that impacted different nations by changing the course of mighty waterways to swamp and burning vast tracts of vegetated land, killing and forcing the internal migration of people from various nations. Henry Haydon – novelist, artist, frontiersman and anthropologist – befriended various tribes in Victoria during his five years in Australia to 1845. He learned their language and history. In his 1846 book – Five Years’ Experience in Australia Felix, Comprising a Short Account of Its Early Settlement and Its Present Position, with Many Particulars Interesting to Intending Emigrants – Haydon recounted the 10,000-plus-year-old story of Victoria’s main bay (which came to be known as Port Phillip Bay) filling with water after the last ice age. “There is a tradition amongst the natives of this part of the country,” he wrote “that the whole space now occupied by the bay of Port Phillip was once dry land, and that the sea overstepping its natural boundary burst through the part of the coast now forming the entrance to the harbour and flooded the whole country and drowned great numbers of people.” The bay again dried out (except for a small salty lake at its heart) when its entrance was blocked with sand and silt, quarantining it from Bass Strait. It refilled perhaps less than 1,000 years ago. In recent years, some extraordinary academic work has coupled detailed anthropological studies of Aboriginal oral history (and other forms of storytelling or experiential recording including dance, song and visual art) with scientific reviews of post-glacial sea-level rises dating at least 7,000 years. In a 2015 article, Patrick Nunn and Nicholas Reid collated the Indigenous stories from 21 locations around the Australian coast and compared them with scientific data about sea-level rise. They wrote how scientific consensus “appears to be that memories of particular events/persons can generally survive no more than 500-800 years” but the long pre-invasion comparative cultural global isolation of Aboriginal peoples, their critical reliance on traditional knowledge and intergenerational transmission of it, and their intense attachment to country, gave their “memories of events/people ... the best chance of enduring across multiple generations”. The experiences of coastal flooding, they found, were conveyed as both narratives and myths – stories involving creationist spirits and animals that are central to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ traditional beliefs and cosmology. The widest exposed mass of continental shelf was off Arnhem Land within the Gulf of Carpentaria – a lake within a land bridge that once connected Australia and New Guinea during the last glacial maximum, Nunn and Reid recount. “The Aboriginal inhabitants of the Wellesley Islands in the southern part of the Gulf of Carpentaria have a rich extant body of oral tradition that includes ‘oral accounts of channels being cut between islands elaborated into sacred histories of ancestral beings’ ... Several accounts recall a time when the Wellesley Islands were part of a mainland peninsula but then the ‘seagull woman’ named Garn-guur dragged her raft back and forth across its neck causing it to be submerged and the islands to form. Stories with this theme are told to explain the creation of at least five islands in the Wellesley group.” They also recount an anecdote (possibly referring to the most recent flooding of Port Phillip Bay some 1,000 years ago) to an 1859 Victorian parliamentary committee “on the Aborigines”, from one of the Woiwurrung tribes, traditional owners of the area. “‘Plenty long ago ... men could cross, dry-foot, from our side of the bay [in the east] to Geelong [in the west].’ They described a hurricane – trees bending to and from – then the earth sank, and the sea rushed in through the heads, till the void places became broad and deep, as they are today.” Which goes to show that what might be ecologically or geologically unprecedented in settler Australia is almost certainly not so in the context of continental pre-history and the (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) homo sapiens who continuously inhabited this place for as long as it is possible to make sense of time. Contemplating “Mungo Man” – who lived at least 36,000 years ahead of Abraham before his elaborate burial in the (already dry) Willandra Lakes region of New South Wales – and his cosmological link to human beginnings is an almost mind-altering context through which to view lived experience of ecology, geography and natural disaster here. But it is an inescapable and rich truth that all lived experience on this continent including natural disasters (notwithstanding that the cause of the more recent is, in part, human-induced climate change) is part of a continuum as old as humankind.",Opinion/Opinion,Are the devastating floods a continuum in Australia? | Paul Daley,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/11/are-the-devastating-floods-a-continuum-in-australia
3/11/2022,"When Shane Warne was found unresponsive in Koh Samui, Thailand a week ago his manager, James Erskine, issued a short statement confirming his untimely death at 52 and relaying his family’s wish to be left alone to grieve. “The family requests privacy at this time and will provide further details in due course,” he said. On Monday his family gave the media a lengthy statement with individual quotes from his parents, Keith and Brigitte, his three children, Jackson, Summer and Brooke, and his ex-wife, Simone Callahan. The document included a pointed remark about the media and the family’s desire for privacy. “We also wish to acknowledge and thank those members of the media who are honouring our request to respect our family’s privacy and who will [their emphasis] continue to do so.” The passing of Shane Warne is the passing of a true modern great. Request the media to allow his family, friends, fans mourn his untimely demise for sometime before you begin analysis of his playing career, personal habits or death. But many editors were not listening as they scrambled to dig up any and all information in Thailand and Australia. There were paparazzi shots taken outside Callahan’s property in Victoria, with long lenses capturing Warne’s colleagues as they arrived to pay their respects to the family. Intrusive photographs from inside Warne’s hotel room were published, including closeups of the inside of his suitcase, his nightstand and his bed. “Sitting on Warne’s bedhead was a packet of Benson and Hedges smokes – his cigarette of choice,” one report said. Nine broadcaster Tracy Grimshaw said on social media: “Hoping Shane’s grieving kids don’t read the graphic police descriptions of the hotel room and what happened there.” SBS presenter Jenny Brockie said she agreed with Grimshaw’s criticism on Twitter. The media got their hands on CCTV footage from the villa: “Final moments captured in haunting CCTV images,” and, “Four masseuses are seen on CCTV leaving resort where Shane Warne was found.” No disrespect meant to Shane Warne's family. I feel for them. They're going through the personal hell that losing a loved one brings and I wish them well. To the media, give it a rest. Show some respect and stop treating this like it's a rock and roll tour. pic.twitter.com/o7OendJjNe The speculation about the cause of death began immediately with several stories asking whether his diet and lifestyle were to blame. On Friday morning the Herald Sun, Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail all published photographs of Jackson and Brigitte Warne and other family members and friends waiting for his coffin to be repatriated. His death did not bring to an end the tabloids’ fascination with his private life and has left many asking whether the coverage should have been more sensitive to the grief of his family and friends. On Saturday the three commercial networks will put aside their rivalry and unite to present a fundraising concert for communities who have suffered from the devastating floods across Queensland and New South Wales. The Seven Network, Nine and Network 10 will join for the first time in 17 years to present Australia Unites: Red Cross Flood Appeal, live on Saturday 12 March, at 7.30pm AEDT. While we can’t fault the generosity of the people involved in pulling the mammoth event together in under a week the hosting lineup is once again an all-white affair, with commercial TV failing to reflect Australia’s multicultural society. Hosts include Nine’s Scott Cam, Sylvia Jeffreys, Andy Lee and Peter Overton, Seven’s Natalie Barr, David Koch, Sonia Kruger and Mark Ferguson, and Ten’s Carrie Bickmore, Dr Chris Brown, Amanda Keller and Osher Günsberg.

We may soon be hearing a lot more from the founding editor of rightwing online magazine Quillette, Claire Lehmann. Lehmann made her debut appearance on Q+A on Thursday night, an episode hosted by Stan Grant which hit a new low of just 175,000 metro viewers. No reflection on Lehmann, who was one of five women invited as panelists on a special International Women’s Day episode.

Her last piece for the Australian, which was about Grace Tame and Britney Higgins at the National Press Club, was published on 6 February. In it Lehmann said she admired both women for their courage but warned “about creating a culture that fetishises stories of female victimisation”. The Sunday Age deputy editor, Patrick O’Neill, told Weekly Beast that Nine Entertainment was “in discussions” with Lehmann over a role. Lehmann did not respond to a request for comment. On Thursday the ABC managing director, David Anderson, opened the ABC’s first bureau in Charleville in south-west Queensland, one of 55 new positions which have been filled in every state and in the Northern Territory. The ABC has been able to expand its regional and rural coverage – bringing the number of journos outside the cities to 600 – thanks to the passage of the news media bargaining code 12 months ago. After being a late entrant to the eligible media organisations, the ABC was able to negotiate with Facebook and Google for an undisclosed sum which the broadcaster promised would be spent on regional and rural public interest journalism. The Guardian Australia editor, Lenore Taylor, said the tech funds “made a huge, huge difference to our newsroom” and enabled the site to double its podcasting desk and expand reportage outside the capital cities.News Corp Australia and Nine Entertainment also signed deals with Facebook and Google but neither company has chosen to disclose what the funds have been spent on. The code was described this week by the Judith Neilson Institute (JNI) inaugural Alan Moorehead journalist-in-residence, Bill Grueskin, as an Australian success story “to those who’ve long yearned to force big tech to prop up suffering newsrooms,” who also said it was “a murky deal” with unprecedented secrecy. Grueskin, who is a professor of professional practice at Columbia University’s graduate school of journalism, spoke about his research into the code at JNI’s Chippendale headquarters on Thursday, and how difficult it was to glean any details from the media companies which signed the deals with the tech giants. “Critical details [were] guarded like they’re nuclear launch codes,” Grueskin said. He said he was surprised how tight-lipped everyone was about the nature of the deals, said to be worth a total of $200m. Grueskin’s article about the code in the Columbia Journalism Review summed it up: “In the words of one Sydney media executive, ‘It’s like a brown paper bag gets stuffed with money, is shoved across the table, and then the platforms can say: Now just shut the fuck up.’” Daily Telegraph columnist Miranda Devine, who joined the New York Post for an 18-month stint before the 2020 US election, has loved it so much she has decided to stay in the Big Apple. Devine has become a darling of the right in the US, making the gig work with appearances on Fox News, columns in Murdoch’s Sydney and New York tabloids and a book about Hunter Biden’s laptop, Laptop From Hell. “It is very exciting,” Devine told CNN’s Source Material. “There is never a dull minute at the New York Post,” she said. “I’ve loved my time here and I look forward to lots more.” The editors of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, Bevan Shields and Gay Alcorn, have belatedly apologised to readers for incidents last month which brought the Nine newspapers considerable criticism. Weekly Beast reported two weeks ago that at least one staff member told Shields before 7am that the Sydney train outage was “not technically a strike” and that “industrial action” would be a better description. Shields insisted it was a strike. Internal messages revealing the exchange were later leaked. In a letter to subscribers on Friday Shields said it wasn’t a conspiracy it was just a “stuff-up”: “Some critics have tried to portray the use of the word ‘strike’ as some kind of conspiracy but this was simply a stuff-up, which was later corrected. Any assessment of our coverage over the following hours and days would detect no sign of anti-union bias.” There was no explanation why it took more than 10 days between staff raising concerns and the readers’ letter to correct a basic factual mistake. Alcorn addressed the removal of the story by Chip Le Grand that suggested multimillionaire Geoff Bainbridge was the victim of an elaborate six-year extortion racket. The Melbourne editor, who had already admitted the Age was “badly misled”, told readers it was an “embarrassing error” and that she was sorry. “This was an embarrassing error, and we have inquired into how it happened and what our processes should be to prevent something like this happening again,” Alcorn said.",News/Media,Did media coverage of Shane Warne’s death step over the line? | The Weekly Beast,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/11/did-media-coverage-of-shane-warnes-death-step-over-the-line
3/11/2022,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia was a “terrorist state” in his latest video address. “The world must know it. The world must acknowledge it,” he said, and also accused Russian forces of attacking a convoy of humanitarian aid for the besieged city of Mariupol. Zelenskiy said Ukrainian authorities managed to evacuate almost 40,000 people on Thursday from five other cities. The Russian defence ministry said that it would open up humanitarian corridors for civilians to evacuate from Kyiv, Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv and Mariupol. It also accused Ukraine of using security service personnel to drive aid trucks and spy on Russian military positions. There are conflicting reports about the state of Russian forces around Kyiv. A large Russian military convoy last seen north-west of Kyiv has largely dispersed and redeployed, according to US company Maxar Technologies, based on satellite photographs. But a US defence official said on Thursday that Russian forces have moved 5km (or about 3 miles) closer to the Ukraine capital, despite Ukrainians fighting back “very, very well”. A recently released report from the UK’s Ministry of Defence says Russian forces are “committing an increased number of their deployed forces to encircle key cities” due to strong Ukrainian resistance. The United Nations security council will convene on Friday at Russia’s request, diplomats said, to discuss Moscow’s claims of US biological activities in Ukraine. High-level talks between Russia and Ukraine – the first of their kind since Moscow invaded its neighbour two weeks ago – ended without a ceasefire. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said there had been no progress towards achieving a ceasefire with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. Hundreds of thousands of people in ​Mariupol face an “increasingly dire and desperate” humanitarian situation, the International Red Cross has said. A delegation leader said people in Mariupol had “started to attack each other for food” and many people report having no food for their children. Ukraine opened seven humanitarian corridors for civilians to evacuate on Thursday, but no one was able to leave the besieged port city of Mariupol, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister said. In the north-eastern Sumy region, more than 12,000 civilians were evacuated by car or bus, the state emergency services said. The British public will be able to offer accommodation to Ukrainian refugees as the government announces a new route to the UK for those fleeing the Russian invasion. Boris Johnson has ​expressed fears that ​Vladimir Putin may use chemical weapons in Ukraine. Echoing language used by the White House, the UK prime minister said Russian claims about its enemies getting ready to use chemical weapons were “straight out of their playbook”. Germany’s former chancellor Gerhard Schröder has reportedly met Russian president​, Vladimir Putin,​ in Moscow for talks on ending the war in Ukraine, Politico reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. The Chelsea football club owner, Roman Abramovich, is among seven of Russia’s wealthiest and most influential oligarchs to have been hit with sanctions by the UK, in an effort to further punish allies of Vladimir Putin over the invasion of Ukraine.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war update: what we know on day 16 of the Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/russia-ukraine-war-update-what-we-know-on-day-16-of-the-russian-invasion
