12/30/2021,"The American west faced an unprecedented year of climate disasters in 2021. A cold wave in February triggered temperatures 50F below average in Texas, killing at least 150 across the state and leaving millions without power and water. Heatwaves over the summer broke temperature records across different western states, killing hundreds in the northwestern US and Canada. Fires seared through large swathes of the west, razing the northern California town of Greenville and searing through groves of giant sequoia trees.  This summer, the Guardian interviewed a panel of climate scientists about their experiences living through the crises that climate research had long foretold. As the year ends, they share their reflections on what’s happened – and what gives them hope, even as climate catastrophe looms. The climate scientist: ‘The extraordinary is no longer extraordinary’Daniel Swain, ColoradoClimate scientist, Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, University of California, Los Angeles The last few years featured some really prominent global climate and weather extremes. And this year, in particular, kind of puts an exclamation point on that. The magnitude and frequency of what happened over the past 12 months or so is pretty remarkable. The extraordinary and unprecedented is no longer extraordinary or unprecedented because it’s starting to happen so often. In June, we had that unbelievable heatwave across the Pacific north-west and British Columbia. We had Death Valley-like temperatures in the glacial valleys of British Columbia, that, for me personally, is probably one of the most shocking modern heatwave events I can remember anywhere. But then, we had the fires throughout the west followed by record-breaking, extreme precipitation – sometimes in the same towns and cities that were affected by heatwaves and fires. The fingerprint of human-caused climate change is really clear. And what we’re starting to see is that a lot of these impacts of climate change are outpacing our efforts to deal with them. Emergency management systems, transportation infrastructure and water conveyance infrastructure is failing. We’re seeing implications for things like energy infrastructure, as we saw in Texas, and for water infrastructure, in places like California. Infrastructure, even in wealthy nations, is designed with a finite tolerance to extremes. The good news, and the bad news, is that we are the cause of this. Climate change is happening because of us, and so we are the ones to fix it. Of course, we can also choose not to fix it – and that’s the tension I constantly feel. The meteorologist: ‘Maybe this will be a wake up call’Simon Wang, UtahProfessor of climate dynamics at Utah State University The natural disasters, the drought, the heat – it’s hardly surprising any more. Everything that happened has followed the trend that has been predicted 10, 20 years ago. I hate to say: ‘I told you so.’ But I just want to make clear that when scientists predict something, there are usually good reasons for that. People should trust the science. Now more and more people are suffering. But maybe it will make more and more people realize that these extreme weather events and fires will keep happening – maybe this will be a wake-up call. With each year of extreme weather events, maybe we’ll start to see policy change. But even politically conservative states are starting to feel the pain, and are starting to consider action. Take Utah. Here the Great Salt Lake, because of the drought, is at a record low level. The lake is shrinking, and the decline is a sign of bigger things - of declining snowfall and snow melt, of declining water for household and industry. As the lake shrinks, more of the dry lake bed is being exposed, and winds could cause it to send toxic dust into the air. And all that has triggered a lot of panic. I’ve been studying the effects of climate change on the Great Salt Lake for over a decade. But this is the first year I have seen so many calls for actions coming from all sides. People are realizing just how fragile the natural balance is, and there is a chance right now to salvage it. So now scientists will have federal funding, and will be working with different agencies and different task forces to study the problem and inform policy changes and conservation measures to save the lake. That’s where I am. I try to be both alarming and optimistic. The paleoclimatologist: ‘There’s a lot we can all do’Kathleen Johnson, CaliforniaAssociate professor of earth system science at the University of California, Irvine Central and northern California saw an unprecedented fire season yet again, one that was incredibly destructive and had huge social, economic and ecological impacts. And then, it was followed by this huge, extreme rainfall event. In the paleoclimate record, we can see that these big swings between extreme drought and extreme wet conditions has been a normal feature of California’s climate. But we also know that climate change is likely to increase the amplitude of these extremes. We know that with rising temperatures, droughts will become more droughts and fires will become more intense and more frequent. And we know that we can expect greater rainfall during these extreme events. One of the things that has really hit home to me about this year is the fires’ impact on giant sequoia trees in the Sierra Nevada. I’ve done research in the Sequoia national park and it’s one of my favorite places in the world – these trees are just amazing. And they’re actually fire-adapted trees – they require fire to live and propagate. But the fires have been so extreme this year and last year that they’ve permanently killed thousands of sequoia trees. A recent report indicated that up to 20% of the sequoias have been killed in the last two years alone – and that just makes me really sad. It makes me worried that future generations are not going to be able to enjoy the beauty of these trees. As a paleoclimatologist, it also motivates me to look back at the idea of trying to develop better records of fire in the Sierras, and so better inform and understand what is happening and what’s to come. There’s a lot we can all do. My students are also so incredibly motivated – they care deeply about sustainability and environmental justice. So as an educator, I see that as my role: to help send these well-trained scientists out there who can advise on policy issues, and help make these changes happen. The atmospheric scientist: ‘It’s like being knocked over by a wave’Katharine Hayhoe, TexasClimate scientist and chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy These supersized disasters just keep coming and coming. According to a recent analysis, there was about an average of three months in between each billion-dollar weather or climate event back in the early 1980s. And nowadays, the average is about 18 days between them. So it’s not only that individual events themselves are getting more dangerous and more damaging. It’s that there’s no respite. It’s like being knocked over by a wave. You’re struggling to your feet, when another one comes. There’s no time to take a breath in between, there’s no time to recover. To those living in the west, and experiencing the fires, heatwaves, and flooding – I would say you have good reason to be anxious, your fears are valid, your concerns are real. Now, how can we use our voices to encourage action at every level? It’s not about saving the planet. The planet will be orbiting the sun long after we’re gone. It is about saving us – our civilization, and many of the other living things that share this planet with us. I see that the majority of people are worried that we don’t know what to do. And if we don’t know what to do, that fear will paralyze us. And if it paralyzes us, we are doomed. And so providing people with a sense of efficacy of how they as an individual can make a difference. And it’s not just you know, changing your lightbulb or cutting out your meat consumption. It’s engaging and using your voice and advocating for change in your community in your place of work.

12/30/2021,"Talia Hibbert was rewatching a Spider-Man film and eating a meal in her living room when she received life-changing news. Her romance novel Act Your Age, Eve Brown, which she wrote at the beginning of the pandemic, had entered the New York Times bestseller list. The lighthearted romantic comedy, published this year, follows the escapades of a young black British woman who crashes into the life of an uptight B&B owner.  Hibbert had not expected readers outside her established fanbase to be interested in the book, which she describes as her most ridiculous one to date. But it did reach a much bigger audience, thanks in part to large book-loving communities on Instagram, YouTube and, most importantly, TikTok. These communities, known as Booksgram, BookTube, and Booktok, are not just spaces for people to share their passion for whatever their reading. They also have huge marketing power, driving books such as Hibbert’s up the bestseller charts and reshaping the publishing world. The phenomenon is being felt acutely in romance novels, particularly those with diverse characters and storylines, which have previously struggled to break through via traditional publishing routes. Hibbert, 25, started reading romance novels when she was 12. At the time, the books available in the genre were not very diverse. “I didn’t even think of trying to be traditionally published because I very much had the mindset that it wasn’t going to happen for someone like me writing characters like mine,” she said. “I knew that if I was going to have a chance of being traditionally published, I had to be better than the best. And I just didn’t think I was. I thought I was good, but I didn’t think I was good enough to overcome not being white, essentially.” She initially self-published and built a loyal fanbase. As well as having leading black characters, Hibbert also explores chronic illness and other forms of disability in many of her novels. “I’m really glad I did that because it enabled me to figure out what kind of writer I wanted to be and develop my own platform on my own terms,” she said. She was able to get an agent and sold the three-part Brown sisters trilogy to the US publisher Avon. The books exploded on social media. Readers of all races and ages were raving about the series, and found their way to her other books. Among them was Tolu Akingbade, a 22-year-old master’s student at Cambridge University, who started posting on TikTok at the beginning of the year. She now has more than 31,000 followers. She said many were people of colour and/or LGBTQ+, who often thanked her for the diverse romance recommendations. “It’s really important to be able to see yourself and understand that you’re not invisible,” Akingbade said. “Authors like Talia Hibbert blowing up has shown people that black British people exist, which I know feels silly but at the same time it’s not their fault because when have we been shown?” She loves books that simply show “black girls in love” and have joyful storylines. “I love romance stories that focus on community as well and talk about found family. I think that is something that we can really see in the black community, especially in the UK.” Soniya Ganvir, who is one half of the Instagram account Brown Girls Read Books, says accounts like hers show publishers that there’s demand for these kinds of books from readers of all races. “In the last year I’ve read more books with black and brown protagonists in the romance sector than I ever have,” the 32-year-old said. “And, increasingly, white authors of romance are including characters that aren’t white.” While she has welcomed this increase, she says some of these books are being rushed out and many romance writers of colour are still being let down by their editors or marketing teams. Sumayyah Malna, 32, the other half of the account, said: “And so part of how our account grew is to specifically showcase and promote writers of colour and those books that don’t get the attention that they deserve. “We do read quite widely, and we don’t just exclusively read writers of colour. We read some amazing books by white authors, but there’s no point in us, as far as we’re concerned, promoting those because they get the promotion.” They are both eager for further change, and call specifically for more books where women of colour are at the centre of a “pure romance” storyline. Ganvir said: “I think it is great for people of colour to feature in stories without their race being an element of it. They can be characters who fall in love, they can be characters who beautiful, joyful things happen to them.”",Arts/Books,Romantic fiction writers creating a more diverse happily ever after,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/30/romantic-fiction-writers-diverse-happily-ever-after-book-social-media-barriers-bestsellers
12/30/2021,"Fewer Australians will be told to get tested for Covid, with most states backing a much narrower definition of a close contact, as a record 21,000 new daily cases were reported nationwide. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, cited “some very practical problems” caused by the more infectious Omicron variant – including the huge strain on the PCR testing scheme that had been at the centre of Australia’s response for two years.  Speaking after a snap national cabinet meeting on Thursday, Morrison called for a “reset” because it was unfeasible to “have hundreds of thousands of Australians or more taken out of circulation based on rules that were set for the Delta variant”. The changes come on the same day the OzSage group of scientists and economists warned that a “let it rip” and “defeatist” approach to Covid would disrupt the health system and be felt most by vulnerable groups. Morrison insisted he took “responsibility for the decisions we have taken” and flatly rejected OzSage’s advice that “a fatalistic approach will be fatal for some people”. The prime minister said: “I accept the chief medical officer’s advice.” Under the new definition – expected to be adopted by all states and territories except Western Australia at this stage – a close contact is someone who lives with or has been in a “household-like” situation with a confirmed Covid-19 case for at least four hours. Confirmed Covid-19 cases and close contacts will have to stay at home for seven days, with a rapid antigen test on day six in order to clear the way for them to return to the community. “If you are anything other than a close contact, and you are not symptomatic, you don’t need to go and get a test,” Morrison said. “Now, I know this is a bit different to what you have been hearing over the last couple of years. That is the gear change. That is the reset. That is what we need people to really understand.” Morrison said the change would “ensure that our public health systems work as effectively to keep as many people are safe as possible”. But the Australian Medical Association blasted the new definition, saying the move “appears to put politics over health” and would “accelerate the outbreak of Omicron”. The AMA president, Dr Omar Khorshid, said authorities would “miss so many more cases with this new, more narrow definition of a close contact”. “It seems national cabinet is prepared to bet that a massive Omicron outbreak won’t cause large numbers of hospitalisations,” Khorshid said. The new rules are expected to come into effect at midnight on Thursday night in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, the ACT and South Australia – although SA will still maintain a 10-day isolation rule. Tasmania is set to adopt the new rules on 1 January, and the Northern Territory is due to announce its plans in the coming days. But the Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, said his state was in a “very different” position from the states “with a high case load”, and still hoped to “eliminate” the current outbreak. WA reported just one new Covid case on Thursday. McGowan said he had “agreed in principle” to the new settings proposed at national cabinet, but they would only be implemented “at a later stage” if needed. Queensland’s chief health officer, Dr John Gerrard, bluntly backed the change to the definition of close contact. “If we continue to use our current settings, then all of us will be in quarantine, and the state won’t function,” Gerrard said. As Queensland recorded 2,222 new cases, Gerrard also sought to prepare the recently Covid-free state to expect “tens of thousands of cases”. He said “we are not going to stop the Omicron virus” but there were some things that could slow its spread – like mask-wearing and working from home if people could. The federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, accused Morrison of “always playing catch up” and called for “some national leadership that has been sorely lacking”. “People are worried, people are voting with their feet by not going out, by not going to restaurants, by not undertaking activity that they normally would in the lead-up, particularly, to New Year’s Eve,” Albanese said in Adelaide. Morrison told reporters in Canberra: “Each and every day, I have focused on this pandemic to ensure that we have got the best possible settings that we can have, so I do take responsibility for the decisions we have taken.” Australian health authorities on Thursday reported 21,343 new Covid cases, a new record for the country, including 12,226 infections in NSW, 5,137 in Victoria and 1,374 in South Australia. The chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, said Omicron was “very transmissible”, but data from South Africa – which had “the longest and most extensive experience” of the new variant – indicated a 73% decrease in severity compared with Delta. He said Australia’s figure of 1,400 people with Covid in hospital out of the 110,000 active cases was “much lower than what we have seen before”. Currently 122 people were in intensive case. Prof Robert Booy, an infectious diseases paediatrician at the University of Sydney, said that “for the vast majority, it will probably be fine” to reduce to seven the number of days after a positive diagnosis that a symptomless case could leave isolation. “For people who do test positive who are asymptomatic five days after their test and are well enough to go back into the community, they’re unlikely to transmit any virus,” Booy said. But Prof Nancy Baxter, head of the University of Melbourne’s school of population health, and a member of the OzSage executive, said the changes to the close contact definition would just fuel the outbreak. She said the move “reflects the crisis that we’re in” and was a case of “Newspeak”, a term coined by George Orwell in Nineteen Eighty-Four to describe propagandistic language that twists ordinary meanings. “The lines for testing will get shorter, the cases won’t rise as quickly [but] it’ll just mean we aren’t identifying them,” Baxter said. “They’ll be invisible until the hospitalisation rates start going up.” The president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Dr Karen Price, said the testing, tracing and isolating system had “just collapsed”, so the use of PCR tests had to be rationalised. “It’s to manage the resources better, which I understand, but it has to come with other, clear directions,” she said. Michael Lydeamore, a lecturer in Monash University’s econometrics and business statistics department, said something had to be done because the system wasn’t coping. There would be a shift to “people choosing the right thing to do rather than being forced to do the right thing”.",News/Australia news,Fewer Australians to have Covid tests as national cabinet agrees to new definition of close contact,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/30/fewer-australians-to-have-covid-tests-as-national-cabinet-agrees-to-new-definition-of-close-contact
12/30/2021,"When Valentin Gendrot applied for a job with the Paris police in 2017, he didn’t expect to get through the vetting process. A thorough background check would have revealed that Gendrot, then aged 29, was an investigative journalist who specialised in exposing dubious working practices: he had previously worked undercover at a call centre, a debt recovery agency and a car plant. His application was, however, successful and he began a two-year stint as an adjoint de sécurité (ADS), a position roughly equivalent to a police community support officer in the UK. Things got off to an underwhelming start when, on completing the obligatory three months’ training, he was assigned to a dreary posting at a mental health facility, charged with transporting patients from one psychiatric unit to another. After 15 months in this role he earned a transfer to Paris’s notoriously restive 19th arrondissement, where he was finally able to experience front-line policing.  Gendrot’s account of his time on the force, Flic, made waves in France last year and is now available in English, thanks to Frank Wynne’s tidy translation. It portrays a working culture in which racism and misogyny are rife and police regularly exceed their powers with impunity. “Officers dealing with members of the public, he writes, “are routinely overfamiliar, inappropriate, aggressive in their words and actions, and insulting, and they unlawfully confiscate merchandise … from those [unlicensed street hawkers] issued with fines.” In one particularly disturbing incident, an officer beats up an innocent teenager for talking back. The boy, of African heritage, is bundled into a police van and repeatedly punched; Gendrot watches as his colleague goes “completely berserk, uses his elbow to pin the boy’s chest so he can lay into him … like a man possessed”. When the victim later files a complaint, triggering an internal investigation, several officers give false testimony in support of their co-worker, who is cleared of wrongdoing. Gendrot wonders: “How can he ever trust the police again after this incident?” While the depiction of the police in these pages is unflattering and at times damning, it is not entirely unsympathetic. Gendrot cites a 2018 report by the French senate into the working conditions of officers serving in the Île-de-France region, which identified a number of chronic problems. Some, such as the psychological stress of regularly confronting violence, are intrinsic to the occupation and to a degree inevitable. Others, such as long hours, irregular work patterns and the pressure of having to meet performance targets, are endemic to the 21st-century neoliberal managerialism espoused by President Macron. The toll of these conditions is most clearly visible in the alarming suicide rate among French police officers, which is 36% higher than among the general population. In 2019, the director general of the police force responded to concerns about officers’ mental health by issuing a memorandum advising local constabularies to arrange barbecues to boost morale – an intervention derided by many officers as feeble and condescending. Any credible critique of policing must give due weight to these organisational questions, and the author does not duck this. Some matters, however, are cultural rather than structural, and Gendrot’s anecdotal snapshot of life on the force suggests the prevalence of macho and chauvinistic attitudes is a big problem: people of non-white heritage are referred to by discriminatory epithets; a male officer persistently harasses a female colleague, rigging the work schedule to ensure she is always assigned to accompany him on patrols; while sharing a dorm with a fellow ADS, Gendrot wakes one morning to find his roommate sitting naked on his face, with his balls resting on his forehead, taking a selfie. Gendrot’s encounters with male boorishness prompt him to reflect on his own conflicted relationship with masculinity. His scrawny frame and spectacles make him a somewhat unlikely copper. He is good at football, which helps him to fit in, but is uncomfortable with some other rituals of male bonding, such as sharing stories of sexual escapades (“something I wouldn’t talk about even with close friends”). These personal asides provide a pertinent subplot to the story: one wonders how many capable people are put off joining the police for fear of not fitting in. This English edition appears at a time of renewed scrutiny of policing in the UK, prompted by several egregious incidents of misconduct – including, most recently, the revelation that officers took photographs of the bodies of two murder victims, which they then shared with colleagues on WhatsApp. Many of the problems highlighted by Gendrot exist, in varying degrees, in police forces all over the world. Chief among these is the perverse code of honour that compels otherwise decent officers to cover for the violent thuggery of colleagues. Without proper accountability a police force ceases to serve the community and becomes something else entirely. As Grendot remarks after witnessing an incident of police brutality: “I feel like I’m riding with a gang that has unlimited powers.”  Cop by Valentin Gendrot is published by Scribe (£9.99).
