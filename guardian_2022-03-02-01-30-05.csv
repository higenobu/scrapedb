3/2/2022,"Thomas Tuchel urged reporters to stop asking him questions about the invasion of Ukraine and Roman Abramovich’s plan to pass the stewardship and care of Chelsea to the club’s charitable foundation. Chelsea’s manager was holding a press conference before Wednesday’s FA Cup tie at Luton Town and lost his cool after being pressed one too many times for his thoughts on the war in Ukraine. Tuchel had faced several questions about Abramovich, who gave up the running of Chelsea after a call in parliament for him to face sanctions, and he snapped after being asked whether he hoped the club’s Russian owner could help to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia. “Listen, listen, listen, you have to stop,” Tuchel said. “I am not a politician. You have to stop, honestly. I can only repeat it. And I even feel bad to repeat it because I never experienced war. So even to talk about it I feel bad because I am very privileged. I sit here in peace and I do the best I can, but you have to stop asking me these questions. I have no answers for you.” Tuchel was asked whether he had a message for Chelsea’s fans after Abramovich’s decision to transfer the stewardship of the club to the foundation’s trustees, who are yet to agree to the arrangement. Some trustees have concerns and the Charity Commission has contacted the foundation for more information after a serious incident report was reported to the regulatory body. “I am not so sure if I am the person who should give messages to the fans about anything other than sports,” Tuchel said. “We are trying to be calm here, I am calm and we are calm at the centre of a storm or some noise around us which we cannot control and are not responsible for. In the end, it is best to stay calm and focus on what we love and do. This is sports. “I think we have a right to focus on sports, the players have a right to be focused and this is what we can tell the fans. I think this is what the fans saw on Sunday. There is a big situation out there and there was a big commitment still from the players, clubs and fans. I think everyone is aware of more important things and the situation is Ukraine is by far more important. We still arrived with two strong teams to play a fantastic match. We arrived still to entertain the fans with a match of maximum effort and entertainment. I don’t know what we could do different.” Tuchel was reluctant to say whether being owned by Abramovich, who has vehemently disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Vladimir Putin and Russia or that he has done anything to merit being sanctioned, is a problem for Chelsea. “I have to say that’s a bit too much for me to answer,” the German said. “I’m not aware of any details, and I’m not aware of the whole situation. We all agree there are situations much, much more important than football, this will never change. And situations like war are of course so much more important. But the role from Mr Abramovich is not on me to comment, because I simply don’t know enough about it.”",Sport/Football,‘You have to stop’: Tuchel loses cool over queries on Russia war and Abramovich,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/01/thomas-tuchel-loses-cool-questions-russia-war-and-abramovich-chelsea
3/2/2022,"An elderly Asian woman who was attacked in New York by a man with a rock has died after spending approximately 10 weeks in a coma, her family said on Monday. GuiYing Ma, 62, was sweeping the sidewalk outside her home in Jackson Heights in Queens on 26 November when a man allegedly struck her head with a rock, police say. Ma is the fourth Asian American in two months to die in New York as a result of violence against members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community. According to data compiled by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, anti-AAPI hate crime was up 339% nationally last year. Many such attacks have been motivated by resentment over the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in China. Stop AAPI Hate, a national coalition that tracks and responds to racially motivated hate crimes, said last August more than 9,000 anti-AAPI incidents had been reported across the US since the pandemic began. In a statement, Ma’s family said: “The deaths of Mrs Yao Pan Ma, Michelle Go and Christina Yuna Lee have made many in the AAPI community feel unsafe. “The family urges tougher law enforcement to keep everyone in the AAPI community safe and in particular, the elderly members of our community.” The man who attacked GuiYing Ma, identified as Elisaul Perez, 33, allegedly hit her on the left side of her head after getting into an argument with her, then left her unconscious and bleeding. Police say he hit her again when she fell. New York police arrested Perez a day later and charged him with assault with intent to disfigure and dismember, assault with intent to seriously injure with a weapon and criminal possession of a weapon. He remains in custody. He has pleaded not guilty. The attack “permanently damaged the right side of Mrs Ma’s brain”, read the family statement, which was posted on a GoFundMe page set up to pay medical expenses. “But the love between Mrs Ma and her husband Mr Zhanxin Gao remained. Despite being connected to a ventilator and a feeding tube, Mrs Ma responded to Mr Gao by moving her eyes and tearing up when Mr Gao would speak to her at the hospital.” Ma woke from the coma in early February and was able to raise her arm in response to her husband, though she was unable to speak. On 22 February, Ma died as a result of “complications of blunt impact injury of head”, her family said. The death was ruled as a homicide. “We are reviewing the latest development in this tragedy and will add or upgrade any appropriate charges supported by the evidence,” a spokesman for the Queens district attorney said. Ma arrived in New York four years ago from Liaoning, China. She is survived by her husband, a son and two grandchildren. According to the GoFundMe statement, funeral services will be arranged after her son is able to travel to New York.",News/US news,Elderly Asian woman attacked with rock in New York dies after 10 weeks in coma ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/01/elderly-asian-woman-dies-rock-attack-new-york-guiying-ma
3/2/2022,"A convicted British money launderer wanted for her role in a £1bn mobile phone tax scam has been arrested by Spanish police after spending almost nine years on the run. Sarah Panitzke, 47, described by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) as one of the UK’s most wanted tax fugitives, was arrested by plainclothes Guardia Civil officers while out walking her dogs on Sunday in the Catalan town of Santa Bárbara. She was part of a 16-strong gang that bought mobile phones abroad without VAT then resold them in the UK. She disappeared in May 2013 while on trial for money laundering offences but was convicted and sentenced in her absence to eight years in prison. Panitzke’s longstanding links with Spain led HMRC to contact the Guardia Civil, who began hunting for her. By 2015, it had tracked her down to the town of Olivella, in the province of Barcelona. Surveillance revealed that Panitzke hardly ever ventured out of her hiding place and was dependent on weekly visits from her husband, who brought her basic supplies. “However during the operation that was due to lead to her arrest, she managed to pick up on the police presence, completely change her appearance, and escape,” the Guardia Civil said in a statement. “From that moment, she became a priority aim for investigators, who gathered and analysed a massive quantity of information about her and kept a permanent watch on her closest contacts. They also found that she had broken off all physical contact with her family in Spain to avoid being detected.” But last month, detectives were alerted to her possible presence in Santa Bárbara, a small town of about 4,000 people in Tarragona province. “At the beginning of last week, we found a woman closely matching the suspect’s physical description who lived in a block of flats on the outskirts of the town,” the statement said. “Mindful of what had happened in 2015, a large team of plainclothes officers was deployed and she was arrested on the morning of 27 February while out walking her pets.” Spain’s highest criminal court, the Audiencia Nacional, remanded Panitzke in custody pending the extradition process. Tom Dowdall, the National Crime Agency’s international deputy director, said Panitzke’s arrest sent a clear message to other fugitives. He said: “We will not rest until you are captured, no matter how long it takes.” He noted Panitzke had been on the run for almost nine years, saying: “Given the length of time, she might have thought we had stopped searching, but she remained on our radar. “Joint working between UK law enforcement and our partners in Spain led to her being apprehended, and we will now seek her extradition back to the UK to serve her prison sentence.” Simon York, the director of HMRC’s fraud investigation service, said: “Sarah Panitzke was one of Britain’s most wanted tax fugitives. She played a pivotal role in a multimillion-pound VAT fraud and moved millions through offshore bank accounts.”",News/UK news,Woman described as one of UK’s most wanted tax fugitives arrested in Spain,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/01/sarah-panitzke-one-of-uks-most-wanted-tax-fugitives-arrested-in-spain

3/2/2022,"The British Gas owner Centrica has become the third big British energy firm to cut ties with Russia within a week, echoing BP and Shell by announcing the end of its gas supply agreement with Kremlin-controlled Gazprom. Chris O’Shea, the Centrica chief executive, said: “We are shocked by the events unfolding in Ukraine and the needless loss of lives. “We intend to exit our gas supply agreements with Russian counterparts, principally Gazprom, as a matter of urgency. “We are working through the details of how best to do this. Additionally we will ensure we are compliant with all relevant sanctions.” Gazprom supplies gas to Centrica, which it then sells to British households. The agreement is understood to account for a fraction of what Centrica supplies to its customers and the gas is not physical gas molecules from Russia. The partnership is not covered by sanctions but Centrica, Britain’s biggest supplier of gas and electricity, has begun talks with Gazprom about unwinding the deal. Shell said on Monday evening that it would withdraw from its own partnership with Gazprom, signalling an exit from assets worth $3bn, including a 27.5% stake in the vast Sakhalin-2 gas project. BP had earlier vowed to offload its $14bn stake in the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft.

3/2/2022,"Here is an utterly bizarre fictionalised biopic of Canadian singing star Céline Dion, whose opening scenes will have audiences screaming and running out of the cinemas the way they were mythically supposed to have done at the Lumière brothers’ first silent movie about the arriving train. Even now, I still can’t believe I have seen it. Valérie Lemercier (from Claire Denis’s Vendredi Soir) directs and stars, playing Aline Dieu – a made-up version of Dion – the youngest of 14 children in Quebec, all the kids kept in line by their formidable working-class mum Sylvette (Danielle Fichaud). Young Aline shows precocious singing talent and her parents send a demo tape to ageing record producer Guy-Claude Kamar (Sylvain Marcel), a version of the real-life René Angélil, who is to become her manager, husband and soulmate as Aline begins her ascent to mega-selling glory, culminating in the Titanic theme My Heart Will Go On and legendary Vegas residencies. Now … you may be wondering: which actor plays Aline as a child? The answer, horrifyingly, is Valérie Lemercier herself! Her face is digitally superimposed on to the body of a girl between 10 and 12, a face first glimpsed impishly peering over the edge of a stage. Why? Why in the name of all that is holy do that? For a terrifying instant, this looks like a biopic of Jimmy Krankie, or a horror film. Lemercier’s weirdly grinning, gurning face superimposed on the child’s head creates an unnatural chill that the film fails to shrug off, even after Aline as an adult is supposed to be glammed up with her teeth fixed. It does at least create a point of interest in what is otherwise a desperately bland TV-style film. But that opening section is the scariest thing since The Omen.

3/2/2022,"From an acerbic novel about queer Māori-Russian-Catalan siblings to a self-published portrait of 100 indigenous women, the books in line for New Zealand’s top literature prizes are some of the most diverse yet, with Māori women represented in every category and emerging authors claiming their seat at the table of established writers. “Within that field of New Zealand writers, there is tremendous diversity of points of view, style and of experience,” said Paula Morris, the spokesperson for the New Zealand Book Awards Trust. “To have both emerging and established writers on our shortlist is a really good sign that we’re not just discarding the old for the new, but we’re not excluding the new because we’re so busy looking after the old and venerable.” The four contenders for the top fiction prize are all first-time nominees in that category, including two Māori authors, one of whom – Rebecca K Reilly – is nominated for her debut novel. Morris cannot remember the last time she saw two Māori writers represented in the top fiction prize. “Perhaps we are seeing a coming-of-age for Māori writers in print.” The shortlist was also striking for the broad range of publishers – from established university presses to tiny independent initiatives, she said. The fiction writers refused to be pinned down by genre, said Rob Kidd, the convener of judges for the fiction prize. “These novels are packed with life in an array of ordinary and extraordinary forms; they all swell with vitality.” “A Good Winter by Gigi Fenster is an unnerving and absorbing reading experience as the darkness gradually closes in. Bryan Walpert’s Entanglement is dazzlingly intelligent and ambitious in scope. Rebecca K Reilly’s Greta & Valdin is gloriously queer, hilarious and relatable, and Kurangaituku by Whiti Hereaka is poetic, intense, clever and richly imagined.” The poetry finalists “have pushed their craft to new limits”, added Saradha Koirala, the category’s convener of judges. “In a time of global instability, Aotearoa poets have reconnected to their sense of self, exploring identity and challenging our collective history.” Established in 1968, the Ockham New Zealand Book Awards are the country’s top literary honours, recognising achievement by New Zealanders in fiction, poetry, illustrated nonfiction and general nonfiction. Only the fiction prize comes with a large cash prize of $60,000. The general nonfiction, poetry and illustrated nonfiction category winners will each receive $10,000. The winners of the four Crystal Arts Trust Best First Book Awards will each receive $2,500. The winner will be announced at an awards ceremony on 11 May, though a decision is yet to be made over whether it will be held in person or online, due to the Omicron outbreak sweeping the country.

3/2/2022,"It’s not the greatest time to be a fan of Everton Football Club. Admittedly, that’s something that could have been said at pretty much any point during the last 9,776 days – the amount of time elapsed since the club lifted their last trophy, less a week to factor in a brief period of contentment following the winning of that 1995 FA Cup – but here we are. Oh the Ev! Oh Joe, Howard, Walter, David, Roberto, Ronald, Sam, Marco, Carlo and Rafa! Those parvenus across the park have just lifted their 16th trophy during your drought! How on earth has it come to this for the School of Science? They just can’t catch a break, is how. On the field, they’re mired in relegation bother, hovering inches above the drop zone, a precarious position where every single point is crucial. That may explain why referee chief Mike Riley has personally apologised to latest boss Frank Lampard for the fiasco last Saturday which saw box-bound Manchester City midfielder Rodri catch the ball, bounce it, cuddle it, spin it on his finger in the Harlem Globetrotter style, and theatrically hold it aloft and address it as Yorick, only for VAR operative Chris Kavanagh to somehow miss the entire performance and wave play on. An egregious mistake on the face of it, though you try getting a full and proper view of the screen when your boots are up on the desk. If that’s not bad enough, things are taking a sour turn off the pitch as well. Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov has had his assets frozen on account of his being, according to the EU, “a pro-Kremlin oligarch with particularly close ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin”. One of those assets, USM, a holding company specialising in telecoms, metals, mining and Sheriff Fatman earworms, sponsors Everton’s training ground and is chaired by club owner Farhad Moshiri. Exactly what effect this will have on the Ev is unclear, which is certainly not ideal, but let’s search for the positive: if nothing else, the fact that nobody has a clue what’s going to happen, or what to do next, or how to fix it, means both the on- and off-field operations at the club are in lockstep for once.

3/2/2022,"Downing Street has criticised a Conservative MP for travelling to Ukraine, despite government guidance warning against anyone visiting the country that is under siege by Vladimir Putin’s troops. Adam Holloway said he was in a town about 80 miles east of the border with Poland and had witnessed queues outside military conscription centres and volunteers packaging up medical kits for Ukrainian soldiers trying to hold off the Russian advance. As he crossed into Ukraine, he described seeing a queue of people trying to flee that stretched for 20 miles, with many of them corralled together and forced to wait for four days in the cold. “The McDonald’s near the border was packed with women and children and a few elderly people,” Holloway said. The Gravesham MP, who is a member of the Commons home affairs select committee and a former soldier, said he believed that unlike in Russia, Ukrainian citizens were offering to join the military voluntarily. Speaking to GB News on Monday night, Holloway said: “I’ve only been on the ground for just over 12 hours but it seems to me that these people here are absolutely determined to fight. “If you look at the moral component of warfare – and as you know I used to be a soldier – that is the decisive thing. “We can’t know what’s going to happen over the next few days and months. But one thing I can absolutely tell you is that these people here – certainly where I am right now and I think right across Ukraine – it does feel to me as if they’re going to fight.” Holloway said that while on his travels he had also run into “Ukraine’s top concert pianist”. He added: “It was fascinating talking to him, because so many people are volunteering for the military that they’re only taking people with actual military experience – there just aren’t enough guns.” Downing Street said it was unaware of Holloway’s trip beforehand. A spokesperson for the prime minister, Boris Johnson, said the advice not to travel to Ukraine “applies to everyone”. Asked if Holloway should return home, the spokesperson said: “He should certainly not travel to Ukraine.” Travel advice issued by the Foreign Office says all British nationals should “leave Ukraine immediately if you judge it is safe to do so”. Those who need assistance are told to contact the government, but the advice said: “British nationals should not expect increased consular support or help with evacuating in these circumstances.”",News/World news,Tory MP Adam Holloway rebuked by No 10 over Ukraine trip,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/tory-gravesham-mp-adam-holloway-rebuked-by-downing-street-for-travelling-to-ukraine-russia-putin-invasion
3/2/2022,"A British man who made a journey of over 1,700 miles to be with his wife and two-year-old son in Ukraine has insisted he is not a “superstar dad” – and said he would fight the Russian army “without hesitation”. Ian Umney, 28, has become an online sensation since beginning his trek, with nearly 200,000 people subscribing to his TikTok page where he documented his travels. Umney, from St Helens in Merseyside, was reunited with his wife, Nelia, and their son, who he asked not to be named, on Tuesday at their home in a city in south-east Ukraine. Speaking to the Guardian moments after he arrived, Umney became emotional as he described stepping off the bus outside his apartment block following a 500-mile train journey from Lviv. He said: “I looked up and I saw my mother-in-law waving at me and I waved back. And then as I went to the door of the apartment block, my wife and son opened the door. And my son put his arms out to me, and gave me a hug. Yeah, there were a few tears. And that felt amazing.” Umney, who has lived in Ukraine for six years, was in Britain for work when the Russian army invaded five days ago, leaving Nelia and their son at home in a city near the Russian border. He said he had not seen his wife and son for nearly a month after they returned to Ukraine after a short stay in Britain on tourist visas for Christmas. Umney said he was woken by his wife in a tearful phone call on Thursday to tell him that Vladimir Putin had sent in the troops. Having being talked out of driving to Ukraine from Merseyside, Umney instead flew from Manchester to Kraków, in Poland, on Sunday, documenting his voyage on TikTok where his updates received millions of views. He told the Guardian the journey was “filled worry and angst” and that he had been stopped and questioned by armed soldiers, including outside his home where the Ukrainian military asked to see his documentation. “It’s all been worth it now I’ve given my wife and son a hug and they are a bit relieved that I’m here.” He added: “I’m quite shocked that so many people are supporting me, calling me a hero, a superstar dad and a brave person. I’m not. I’m just Ian from England and my wife and son are away and I have to be with them.” Umney said his first priority was to bombproof their home and tape up their windows, and that they had planned to travel to the Polish border and then back to the UK but that he would almost certainly be conscripted into the Ukrainian army. His second option, he said, was to “defend the city, and if I need to I will defend Kharkiv and Kyiv. I will do that without hesitation”. Previously a teacher, Umney said he has no military experience and has only ever fired airsoft or BB guns. However, he said he would be prepared to pick up a weapon to fight Russian shoulders. He said: “I’ve got no military experience. Nobody here does. They’re all civilians who are taking up arms. So I’m no different to them. They’re just Ukrainians. I’m just married to one. My heart is here. My blood is half here – my son. I have no second thoughts about picking up a weapon. “I don’t have experience but I’ve got some knowledge. And I just have the heart and determination to defend Ukraine. So I will fight alongside the Ukrainians just as they would with me.”",News/World news,"Merseyside man travels 1,700 miles to be reunited with son and wife in Ukraine",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/merseyside-man-travels-1300-miles-to-be-reunited-with-son-and-wife-in-ukraine
3/2/2022,"Say what you like about Vladimir Putin; he may be slaughtering innocent Ukrainians, but, on the plus side, he has never once called the Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson a racist. Last Tuesday, Carlson, who is reportedly paid $10m (£7.5m) a year for his piercing insights and analysis, told Americans that they had been brainwashed into thinking Putin was a baddie. Think critically, Carlson instructed his depressingly large audience. Ask yourself this, he posited: “Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him? … Is he making fentanyl? Is he trying to snuff out Christianity? Does he eat dogs? These are fair questions – and the answer to all of them is no.” To be clear: these are inane questions and the answer to all of them is: “Turn off Fox News before the rest of your brain turns to mush.” Carlson, it should be said, has significantly toned down the pro-Putin rhetoric in the past few days. What is noteworthy, however, is the fact that Carlson is far from the only person on the US right to have a soft spot for old Vlad. While Donald Trump has called the Russian attack on Ukraine “appalling”, he has also called Putin’s actions “genius”, “savvy” and “smart”. While I haven’t called up every white nationalist group in the US and Europe for comment, it is fair to say the Russian premier has a fervent fanbase among the far right in the west. Why is this? They love what he has done with Russia. They love the way he has dismantled women’s rights. They love his attacks on gay and transgender people. They love his dismissal of western liberalism. Their values align perfectly. There is also a whiff of antisemitism in the right’s support for Putin. On Sunday, for example, Wendy Rogers, a Republican state senator in Arizona, tweeted about the Ukrainian president: “[Volodymyr] Zelensky is a globalist puppet for Soros and the Clintons.” “Globalist” and “Soros” are well-established dog whistles, of course. (Zelenskiy is Jewish.) Rogers’ comments on Zelenskiy came shortly after she attended a white nationalist convention in Florida, where she praised Nick Fuentes, its Holocaust-revisionist organiser, and proposed hanging “traitors” from “a newly built set of gallows”. A very normal thing for a politician to say! Fuentes, meanwhile, urged the crowd to applaud Russia and had them chanting: “Putin! Putin!” It is not just the racism, homophobia and misogyny that the right love about Putin: it is also his muscle. A Yahoo News/YouGov poll from January found that 62% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents reckon Putin is a “stronger leader” than Joe Biden; that number rises to 71% among those who name Fox News as their primary source of cable news. Putin’s bare-chested photoshoots have done their job, eh? While I have absolutely nothing good to say about Putin (or his biceps), we should condemn him without lapsing into simplistic narratives of good versus evil. The right may be full of unthinking Putin fanboys, but there are also a number of liberals who seem to think that Putin is uniquely bad. They are quick to rationalise invasions and occupations when a western country or a western ally is the aggressor. Many liberals care deeply about Ukrainians, as we all should, but aren’t quite so bothered about Yemenis, Syrians or Palestinians. The west should condemn Putin – but it could also do with thinking more deeply about its own actions.

3/2/2022,"The Nevada governor and his wife were accosted and chased from a restaurant in Las Vegas on Sunday, as two men, one a rightwing “digital creator”, shouted profanities and threats. In a statement, Steve Sisolak said the men shouted “racist threats” at his wife, Kathy Sisolak, who is of Chinese heritage. The Sisolaks planned to meet their daughter at the restaurant. They were not accompanied by security guards. Cellphone video posted to social media showed a man in a red T-shirt reading “Cannabis and Combat” asking Sisolak for a picture. While posing with his arm around the governor, the man began to insult him. The man was identified by news outlets as Justin Andersch, a “digital creator” who posts anti-government rightwing conspiracy theories on a blog called Cannabis and Combat. The Las Vegas Sun reported that Andersch took credit for accosting the Sisolaks on a podcast he creates. “Where’s your security at, punk, huh?” Andersch was heard to say in the video, pointing his cellphone at Steve Sisolak’s face. The governor turned to leave. As Kathy Sisolak joined him, Andersch followed, saying: “You working-for-China piece of shit.” Several suspected hate crimes have recently been reported in Las Vegas and Nevada. Last August, an elected official in rural Nye county declared, without evidence, that Kathy Sisolak had family members in China profiting from selling items related to the coronavirus pandemic. Sisolak said then: “Kathy and I, along with so many others, have worked hard to fight back against the anti-Asian racism brought on by misinformation regarding Covid-19, but comments like these only take us backward.” On Sunday, a second man also followed Sisolak and his wife out of the restaurant, shouting that the governor deserved to be hanged. “We should string you up by a lamp post right now,” Andersch said. “You’re running into a patriot now.” In the parking lot, Sisolak’s daughter, Ashley Sisolak, a lawyer and public defender, rushed over to her parents. “Because your daughter’s with you, I’m going to leave you alone now,” Andersch said. Nevada police confirmed they were aware of the incident at the restaurant and were investigating. In a statement, Sisolak said: “We can disagree about the issues but the personal attacks and threats are unwarranted, unwelcome and unbecoming behavior for Nevadans.” Siolak’s press aide, Meghin Delaney, said the governor was “deeply disappointed in how this incident unfolded, particularly with the language used to talk about First Lady Kathy Sisolak’s heritage”.",News/US news,Nevada governor and his wife accosted at restaurant by men shouting ‘racist threats’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/01/nevada-governor-steve-sisolak-restaurant-video

3/2/2022,"Manchester United’s net debt stood at £494.8m on 31 December 2021, up from £455.5m at the end of the previous year, according to the club’s latest accounts. The report, published on Tuesday, shows that a sizeable proportion of the debt increase derived from a fall in broadcasting revenues – £22.3m (20.5%) less was earned in the last quarter than in the equivalent period of 2020-21 – because four fewer games were played. There was also a £2.6m decrease in sponsorship money after the end of the club’s training kit contract, though there was revenue growth of 7.3%. The scale of the debt is regularly raised by fans opposed to the owners, the Glazer family, who undertook a debt-loading takeover in 2005. Speaking to the club’s Fans’ Forum, the football director, John Murtough, claimed United had the “right structures” for the men’s and women’s teams to win trophies. Murtough’s comments come despite the men’s team being in flux with an interim manager in Ralf Rangnick and a 19-point gap to the Premier League leaders, Manchester City. United last won the league nine years ago. “Overall, while there is potential for further improvement and progress, we do feel that we now have the right structures in place across our men’s, women’s and academy teams to support long-term success and we will continue working relentlessly and investing to achieve that,” Murtough said. “We know that consistency is key as we strive for a top-four finish this season. I want to reiterate however that this is not the ultimate objective for Manchester United, and everyone at the club is focused on challenging for the top trophies. “We are now conducting a thorough process for the appointment of a new permanent manager who will take charge this summer, with the objective to get us back to challenging for those domestic and European titles. We are in the process of recruiting for a head of women’s football, emphasising our commitment to our women’s team operations and the women’s game as a whole. One other point of note is that we appointed a director of data science during the quarter to bring together and drive forward the club’s use of data to help players and staff deliver success.”",Sport/Football,Manchester United’s financial results reveal net debt hit £495m at end of 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/01/manchester-united-financial-results-reveal-net-debt-hit-495m-at-end-of-2021
