4/1/2022,"Netflix’s grand adventure into interactive TV was always going to struggle. There’s the problem of cost to overcome with shows such as Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, Cat Burglar and the interactive Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy Vs the Reverend, as it isn’t cheap to write or film every possible branching variation of every possible decision. There’s also viewer passivity – it’s hard to mindlessly enjoy a show if it keeps pestering you to play along. And perhaps most importantly of all, there’s the problem of narrative satisfaction. Why would you, an idiot viewer, tired, bored and clueless, be better equipped to tell a story than the people who do it for a living? But perhaps Netflix has cracked the formula? This morning, deep in the bowels of its sub-menus, the service quietly launched Trivia Quest. It’s a multiple-choice quiz, with no bells or whistles, and its simplicity may point the way forward. You may have played something like Trivia Quest before. If you have, this will either be because you’ve played Trivia Crack, the phone app upon which the show is modelled, or because you’re old enough to remember playing Bamboozle! on Teletext. Either way, it couldn’t be more basic. A question appears on-screen. You pick an answer from four possible choices, then you do the same thing 11 more times and the show is over. Sure, the game tries to justify its existence. There’s a storyline of sorts – a kind of sentient cartoon sword has kidnapped your friends, and the only way to break them out of their cages is by answering questions – but at the heart of it, it’s really just a gussied-up version of the general knowledge quiz machines you find in pubs. I played today’s game, and the whole thing was over in about four minutes. I got full marks, too, but I don’t like to brag. Which isn’t to say that it couldn’t be better realised. When my kids saw Trivia Quest, they all but lost their minds with how relentlessly cute and cartoonish it was. This wasn’t a surprise, because visually it looks like it has been designed to appeal to young children. So you can understand their disappointment when one of the first questions was about the 2002 biographical film Frida, a movie they are not well acquainted with. Nor have they seen Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which hampered their ability to answer a later question. Despite this, I have a feeling that Trivia Quest will find a loyal audience very quickly because, in a masterstroke of scheduling, new episodes are available daily. Netflix has struggled with this model of delivery before – people didn’t exactly turn out in droves for Chelsea Handler’s thrice-weekly talkshow – but a daily quiz is something else entirely. Crosswords are daily. Sudoku is daily. Wordle is daily, for crying out loud, and Wordle is a sensation. You could argue that Trivia Quest is Netflix’s Wordle. You couldn’t possibly base an entire evening around it in the way that you could with, say, Narcos. It’s too brief for that. But it could be the first thing you do when you look at Netflix. It could become an instinctual part of people’s routines. Switch on, wind down by using your general knowledge to free some cartoon blobs from a talking sword for a couple of minutes, then on to the serious stuff. Was this the endgame all along? Did Netflix go to the colossal expense of creating Bandersnatch just to ease viewers into the idea of eventually using Netflix as a general knowledge app? Will Netflix realise the profitability of a short daily quiz and stop funding your favourite show as a result? Let’s hope not. Trivia Quest is a fun way to pass five minutes of your time, but it isn’t the future of entertainment.",Arts/Television & radio,The Wordle of Netflix?

4/1/2022,"As some of the biggest names in football gather in Doha for today’s World Cup draw, commentators will no doubt point out how much money Qatar has lavished on its preparations for the sporting mega-event. They will talk of its vast, gas-fuelled wealth and the $500m (£380m) a week it was at one stage spending on new stadiums, transport links and infrastructure. But despite the billions spent, Qatar’s World Cup infrastructure has been built on the cheap. Hundreds of thousands of workers have been forced to pay for their own recruitment and labour for years earning poverty wages. In villages and towns across south Asia and parts of Africa, young men desperate for work sign up with recruitment agents who, often in collusion with companies or brokers in Qatar, illegally extract huge sums from them in return for a job. It can take a low-wage worker from Bangladesh a year of hard labour just to recoup the fees. For some the bargain eventually pays off; money is sent home, houses are rebuilt, children sent to better schools and marriage dowries paid. Many workers return to Qatar multiple times, a sign perhaps of a lack of opportunities at home, but also that migration can work. But for many others, it’s a trap. They find themselves deep in debt, unable to change jobs and on very low wages. In 2014 I met a worker building the Al Janoub stadium who was earning overtime pay of 45p an hour. In 2016, Amnesty International found scores of workers maintaining the green spaces around the Khalifa stadium earning a basic salary of about 50p an hour. Two years later, the Guardian interviewed a worker at Al Rayyan stadium earning about 60p an hour. And last year I met dozens of workers employed at Fifa-endorsed hotels, earning a basic wage of £1.25 an hour or less. When the case of low wages at Al Janoub stadium was reported, the local organising committee said it was “working with the contractor to rectify any non-compliance”. At Al Rayyan, the committee said it had rectified the case. These are not just a handful of extreme examples. When Qatar introduced a basic minimum wage the equivalent of £1 an hour last year, the UN’s International Labour Organization said that more than 400,000 workers would benefit. In other words, close to half a million workers were earning less than that at the time. That is assuming they get paid at all. Wage theft appears rife in Qatar: we reported on accounts from some of the men who built the offices used by the World Cup organising committee, as well as some of those who have worked on World Cup stadiums. Last month Human Rights Watch highlighted another case involving workers who had not been paid for up to five months. The Qataris point to labour reforms, announced in 2020, as a sign that things are changing. They also cite the abolition of the much-criticised kafala system, which barred workers from changing jobs, and the introduction of a minimum wage. Narad Nath Bharadwaj, Nepal’s former ambassador to Qatar, told me that conditions for workers in Qatar are better than in other Gulf states but described the reforms as “symbolic”. He particularly criticised workers’ wages, saying they receive far less than in other countries with similar levels of affluence. “It’s a dire situation when workers are exploited, paid paltry wages, made to work eight to 10 hours a day in the inclement climate,” he said. Symbolic or not, reforms are not enough. According to the UN’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, when business-related human rights abuses occur, “states must take appropriate steps to ensure … those affected have access to effective remedy”. The local World Cup organising committee has taken an important step in that direction by requiring companies with stadium contracts to partly repay the recruitment fees of workers. But these men only ever made up a small fraction of Qatar’s migrant workforce. Hundreds of thousands more have no prospect of repayment. Even in death, migrant workers often pay their own way. Families of workers who died have told me that the only help they got from Qatar came from their loved ones’ co-workers, who gave up their own money to send a donation, often to help with costly funeral rituals. The Qatari authorities and Fifa talk a lot about the positive legacy of the World Cup. The local organising committee said: “This tournament is a powerful catalyst for delivering a sustainable human and social legacy ahead of, during and beyond the 2022 Fifa World Cup.” But a real legacy would be to help ensure compensation for those who have suffered: men like Tilak Bishwakarma. Nine years ago, I met Tilak as he cremated the body of his son, Ganesh, on the banks of a river near his home in western Nepal. Ganesh had died in Qatar just months after arriving. When I got in touch with him recently, Tilak said the family had received no compensation from his employer. In fact, his son’s death meant they had no way to pay back the loan they took out to pay for his job. “My heart cries whenever I think about him,” he said. “It was my fate to cremate my son, while it should have been the other way round. Nothing hurts a father more than cremating his son.” A spokesperson for the Qatar government said: “There are complex challenges that need to be overcome to protect economic migrants globally, including in Europe. For its part, Qatar is committed to eradicating illegal recruitment practices in its labour market and supporting efforts to tackle abuse and exploitation throughout the global economy.” The spokesperson highlighted a number of initiatives the government has taken to address the payment of recruitment fees, including setting up recruitment centres in major labour-sending countries. “Companies in Qatar are legally required to compensate the families of all workers who lose their lives in a work-related incident,” the spokesperson added.",News/Global development,Low-wage workers have paid dearly for Qatar’s glittering World Cup ,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/01/low-wage-workers-have-paid-dearly-for-qatar-world-cup
4/1/2022,"Jeremy King, the famed restaurateur behind the Wolseley and the Delaunay, has been ousted from the fine dining group he founded in 1981. King, who with his business partner Chris Corbin launched and ran many of London’s top restaurants including the Ivy in Covent Garden, Wolseley next to the Ritz on Piccadilly, Delaunay on the Strand and Le Caprice in Mayfair, announced on Friday he had lost a battle to buy his venture, Corbin & King, out of administration. The bidding war was won by American-born Thai billionaire William Heinecke’s Minor International, which is understood to have paid more than £60m in an auction that took place early on Friday morning. Minor had previously owned 74% of Corbin & King, and had forced the company into administration. In an email to regular diners, which includes many FTSE 100 chief executives as well as celebrities such as Tom Cruise, David and Victoria Beckham, Joan Collins, Nigella Lawson and Paul Smith, King said he had tried to buy the restaurants but lost out to Minor. “We took part in the auction to try and buy the business and assets of Corbin & King that we didn’t already own, including of course all the restaurants. Regrettably, that attempt failed and Minor Hotel Group was the successful bidder, buying the entire business,” he said in the email. “As a result, I no longer have any equity interest in the business although for the time being, I remain an employee. I assume Minor will take immediate control of the restaurants.” Dillip Rajakarier, chief executive of Minor International, said: “Given the global appeal of Corbin & King Ltd’s iconic portfolio of brands, it is no surprise that competition for the business was so strong. “We are delighted that our offer was accepted, and we can now look forward to building on the existing strong foundations to drive growth in the UK and internationally. We have exciting growth plans for the business and are delighted to embark on this journey.” The value of The Wolseley was in how Jeremy King ran it, and how he looked after his guests. Same for Zedel, The Colbert and others. A very tough morning for him, Chris and his team. I wish them well, I'm sure Jeremy will remain the restaurateur's restauranteur pic.twitter.com/4nAUX0DCvb Minor bought a 74% stake in Corbin & King for £58m in 2017 and earlier this year forced the company into administration warning it was “unable to meet its financial obligations”. It found himself at loggerheads with King, who serves as Corbin & King’s chief executive, claiming the founder had repeatedly rejected “proposals to recapitalise the company”. King’s Rolodex must rate as one of London’s most extensive, as his restaurants have been – and still are – popular with both FTSE 100 chief executives having power breakfasts as well as members of royalty and celebrities enjoying themselves.

4/1/2022,"When a high-ranking government minister, James Whitehouse, tells his wife, Sophie, he has been having an affair with a parliamentary aide, and that a newspaper is about to run an exposé, she opts to stand by her man for the sake of the family. But then James receives a visit from police officers who wish to question him about an incident in the House of Commons’ lift. James’s aide, 28-year-old Olivia, has accused him of rape. Sarah Vaughan’s smart psychological thriller ­– a TV adaptation of which begins on Netflix this month – grapples with complex issues of power, sex and consent as it plots the ensuing investigation and court case. The story is told from contrasting viewpoints: there is steely barrister Kate, crisply narrated by Julie Teal, who has built her reputation prosecuting sexual abusers in cases that aren’t clear cut. “Juries are keen to convict the predatory rapist, the archetypal bogeyman down a dark alley,” she observes, “yet when it comes to relationship rape, they’d really rather not know.” Luke Thompson reads from the perspective of Whitehouse, ably conveying his air of upper-class insouciance and privilege – he is a close confidant of the PM who is a childhood friend and fellow member of a Bullingdon-esque club during their Oxford days (the allusions to real-life political figures are hard to miss). Meanwhile, Esther Wane is the brittle Sophie, who must wrestle with her conflicting feelings about her husband, and Sarah Feathers is Ali, a contemporary of Kate’s from university who fears her old friend may have more of an interest in the Whitehouse case than she is letting on.

4/1/2022,"It is hard to imagine a place more different to Qatar than the southern plains of Nepal. Miles of fields covered in dazzling yellow mustard flowers are dotted with small villages. Cows and goats sit in front of houses mostly made of woven strips of bamboo and mud. Clothes are washed by hand, water pumped by foot and rice husks sifted by the wind. A day’s work in the fields pays 300 to 400 rupees (£1.90 to £2.50) plus a plate of food. The dowry system, though illegal, is widespread, forcing already poor families to take desperate measures to find the money: about 600,000 rupees (£3,755) for each daughter. Gangaram Mandal and his wife, Laduwati, had seven daughters. In 2018, faced with the almost impossible task of paying a dowry for them all, along with the daily struggle of finding enough food, Gangaram had little choice but to leave his home in the district of Saptari and go in search of work. Already in debt, he borrowed more money to pay the extortionate recruitment fee to find work in Qatar, and once there most of his paltry salary – the equivalent of 80 pence an hour – went towards the dowries of three of his daughters. He had been there for two years when, at the end of a shift in the searing heat of the summer, he began to vomit and feel faint. Back at his labour camp he went to lie down and never woke up. According to his death certificate, he died of “Heart failure natural causes”. His death sent his family into a spiral of debt, poverty and torment. “How can I feed my children? There’s nothing to eat. And if I feed them, how can I pay for their education? How can I manage my daughters’ dowries?” says Laduwati, sitting outside her home. One of her daughters, Baby Kumari, crouches sobbing beside her. “My dad used to say don’t cry. I’ll come home and give you whatever you want,” she says. “But now he’s dead and there’s no one I can turn to. Who can I call dad?” Laduwati says she has never heard from her husband’s company and, like thousands of other families whose loved ones die in Qatar, did not receive any compensation from his employer. All she got was the wages he was owed, and 175,000 rupees (£1,100) from his co-workers, who chipped in to help with funeral expenses. Qatar’s labour law only requires employers to pay compensation if a death occurs at work or directly because of the work, but this narrow definition and the vague categorisation of workers’ deaths can result in companies avoiding accountability. As in Gangaram’s case, the majority of fatalities are classified as “natural deaths” due to cardiac or respiratory failure, a term which gives no indication of the underlying cause. The cases often involve young men with no apparent health conditions. Autopsies are rarely carried out in cases of natural death, and the Qatari government has yet to commission an independent study into deaths from cardiac arrest, despite a recommendation to do so from its own lawyers eight years ago. Without proper investigations into these deaths, many families may be losing out on compensation. In interviews with the families of seven workers whose deaths were attributed to natural causes, none had received compensation from the companies they worked for. While most families – including Gangaram’s – get compensation from valid personal insurance schemes they must buy in their home countries before departure, the payouts are relatively low. In a recent report on occupational injuries in Qatar, the UN’s International Labour Organization said: “There is a need to review the approach taken to investigating deaths of seemingly healthy young workers from ‘natural causes’, to be able to determine whether they are in fact work-related … to ensure workers’ families receive due compensation.” The deaths of workers who constructed Qatar’s new World Cup stadiums – a tiny fraction of the overall migrant workforce – may offer a glimpse into what is happening on a bigger scale across the country. Of the 40 recorded deaths of workers employed on World Cup stadium construction projects, 37 have been categorised as ‘non-work-related’ by the event’s local organising committee. The figure includes workers who collapsed during their shift and died later in hospital, workers who died in a company bus accident and others who died in their labour camp, in some cases while asleep. Gangaram Mandal’s case appears to fit the same pattern: a sudden death hours after the end of his shift. The Guardian has documented two cases where the families of stadium workers whose deaths were recorded as non-work related were compensated. The organising committee did not respond to a question about whether any other families have been compensated, but said their contractors’ insurance does not usually cover non-work-related deaths. “It was a very hot day and workers often vomit or faint in the bus. He was working inside a ditch so there was little fresh air and very high humidity. It could have played some role,” says a source with knowledge of the case. A representative of the company which employed Gangaram says: “Why are you asking me about compensation? It was a natural death. It was not an accident. How can I give him money?” Narad Nath Bharadwaj, a former Nepal ambassador to Qatar, believes workers should be insured with “24-hour coverage” so that families would get compensation if deaths occur outside the workplace. “Most die on the transport between the labour camp and workplace but they’re not covered for that,” he says. But even in cases where a worker’s death is the direct result of a workplace accident, the families of the deceased appear to struggle to gain compensation. In 2015, Suraj Bishwakarma, 24, was working as a steel fixer on a tower in Qatar when he died, allegedly by falling from a height. Neither the Nepal embassy nor his employer would respond to questions about the exact circumstances of his death. His mother, Bishnu Maya, seems reluctant to stir up painful memories. “No one should have to suffer like me. It would have been better if I had died but the opposite happened. He died before me,” she says. That would have been the last Bishnu Maya ever heard from Qatar, except that Suraj’s brother-in-law, Samser Bahadur Kami, also worked in the country and took up the case with the Nepal embassy. Showing remarkable tenacity, Samser says he made more than 100 visits over six years to the embassy – an hour’s drive each way from his labour camp – to push for compensation. Suraj’s family was eventually awarded compensation in late 2021. The Nepal embassy and the company that employed him and did not respond to requests for comment. Bishnu Maya is reluctant to say how much she received, but when compensation is given for workplace accidents, it is usually about £40,000. “It’s not fair. It should have been much more. Our troubles began after his death. No one can imagine my pain. Even if I get a piece of gold, it is nothing compared to my son,” she says. It is a story repeated across Nepal. Shankar Yadav had worked on a number of high-profile projects in Qatar, including construction of the Doha Metro, a key transport link for the World Cup. Last year, according to a co-worker, he was working as a scaffolder 11 storeys up on an unrelated project south of Doha. The scaffolding collapsed and he and three other workers fell to their deaths. “The scaffolding was not in good condition. It was all rusty,” claims the co-worker. The worker alleged that when police came to the site, the company quickly agreed to pay 50,000 Qatari rials – about £10,000 – compensation to the families of each worker. It is unclear whether further compensation will be paid. The “supreme committee” organising the World Cup in Qatar said in a statement that its commitment to the “health, safety and dignity of all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast and unwavering.” “Our commitment to workers’ welfare has resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision, and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers,” the statement read. Before his death, Shankar’s young wife, Sangita Kumari Yadav, says they used to talk for hours each night. “Whenever I asked him about his work, he would say, ‘The more you know, the more you will worry’, so he didn’t tell me much,” she says. Shankar’s parents are devastated. “When my son was alive – whether or not he was earning – everything was fine, but I have so many problems now,” says his mother, Asa Devi Yadav. In tears, she clutches Shankar’s passport. “Oh my son,” she says, “Where have you gone?” A spokesperson for the Qatar government said in a statement: “Companies in Qatar are legally required to compensate the families of all workers who lose their lives in a work-related incident. Immediately after a work-related fatality occurs … An investigation is carried out by the authorities to identify the cause of death … A final report is submitted to the legal authorities to determine the amount of compensation to be paid by the company to the family.” The ‘supreme committee’ organising the World Cup in Qatar said in a statement that its commitment to the, “health, safety and dignity of all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast and unwavering.” “Our commitment to workers’ welfare has resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision, and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers,” the statement read. Additional reporting by Muhammad Owasim Uddin Bhuyan in Dhaka. Mohammad Kaochar Khan, Bangladesh Khan decided to migrate to Qatar to build a future for his young son. Initially it cost him £2,800 in illegal recruitment fees; eventually it cost him his life. Khan died in his sleep in a labour camp in Doha in November 2017 after his shift as a construction worker. His death was recorded as, “Acute respiratory failure due to natural causes”. He was 34. Khan was employed by a major Qatari construction company whose projects include a number of hotels set to host fans during the World Cup. Khan’s wife says she has not received any compensation from the company. Purna Bahadur Sonar, Nepal Sonar had worked as a security guard in Qatar for seven years without a break when, in April 2021, he went to bed in his labour camp and never woke up. His death was attributed to “Acute heart failure due to natural causes”. He was 28. His family are confused about the circumstances of his death. “When I saw his dead body, I realised no postmortem had been done,” says his brother Danak Sonar. He said they have received no compensation from Qatar. Nepali authorities also said they could not offer compensation as his contract had expired.

4/1/2022,"It’s been 17 years since Pink Floyd made a daring escape from a zoo in Kansas. Now the African flamingo – who also goes by No 492 – has been seen living the life of a fugitive 700 miles to the south, in Texas. The bird fled the Wichita county zoo in 2005 after keepers failed to clip its wings, the New York Times reported. Its survival in the wild was unlikely – indeed, a buddy who also made it out, No 347, hasn’t been heard from since. But Pink Floyd, as No 492 was nicknamed by Texas officials, was spotted this month by a fishing guide, David Foreman, to his intense surprise. Out fishing with a friend in Port Lavaca on Texas’s Gulf coast, “I was expecting to see a bunch of white pelicans from the east coast, coming down here for the wintertime,” Foreman told the Guardian. Instead, he saw what looked like “a poof-ball sitting on a leg”. Soon the bird began “running back and forth. I kind of got the impression that it was just trying to get away from us without having to actually fly off,” Foreman said. Foreman has spent years telling visitors that the long-legged pink waders they see in the area are actually roseate spoonbills, so the sighting shook his long-held conviction that flamingos don’t live in south Texas. “It was confirmation when I saw the head and the beak profile,” he said. He caught the flamingo on video and posted it online to share with friends. “That’s when people started telling me, ‘Oh, that’s probably that escaped flamingo,’” he said. He tagged the Texas parks and wildlife department, which confirmed the news on Twitter. Pink Floyd has returned from the dark side of the moon.The flamingo escaped from a Kansas zoo in 2005 and is often spotted on the #TexasCoast.📷David Foreman@TPWDfish pic.twitter.com/cjrevByDhm The bird had to be No 492, Julie Hagen of the Texas parks and wildlife department told the Times, because the flamingo, named for the number on a tag around its leg, has been spotted locally at this time of year before, and flamingos don’t make a habit of hanging out in the area. “We have no reason to believe that it is any other flamingo,” Hagen said. No 492 was brought to the Wichita county zoo in 2003 at the age of about three, Scott Newland, the zoo’s bird curator, told the Times. That would put it in its early 20s today, which is middle-aged for a flamingo (in the wild, they can live to be about 40). Pink Floyd’s journey southward probably wasn’t a direct flight, said Dr Paul Rose, co-chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s flamingo specialist group. Though the birds can travel long distances in the wild, “they will stop over in various locations,” he said, moving “between suitable areas for foraging, roosting and nesting because those areas are so few and far between”. This was different from migration, he said. Flamingos “are what we call itinerant nomads, so they move only when needed. And they will leave a particular area for a new area if food resources are not plentiful, or if they need to go and breed. So if this flamingo had found everything it required in one particular wetland, he would stay there. That’s why they’re generally quite easy birds to cater for in the zoo.” Floyd’s new home has plenty of perks that might interest a flamingo, including warm temperatures, plentiful food and shallow wetlands. All that’s missing is companionship. “Socializing is quite important for flamingos because it’s how they direct their breeding behavior,” Rose said. “They nest in flocks because it’s very important for the whole flock to breed at the same time to get the biggest number of chicks to fledging.” Their social behavior is also “a byproduct of all having to feed in the same place on the same types of food”. No 492 did manage to find a friend, at least for a while. A Caribbean flamingo, which may have been carried to the area on the winds of a tropical storm, appears to have befriended Pink Floyd in 2006, though they haven’t been seen in each other’s company since 2013, the Times reported. But even with his companion gone, Floyd may not be lonely. “I wouldn’t say that a wild flamingo by itself is going to miss being social,” Rose said. “But it’s likely to move around to try and find another flock of birds, because it will still have that strong breeding urge at the right times of the year.” Foreman hasn’t seen No 492 since early March, but he hasn’t forgotten the experience. “It was just one of those humbling moments,” he said, “where you’ve told all these people over the years that there’s no flamingos in Texas, and, damn, here’s a flamingo.”",News/Environment,Not in Kansas any more: flamingo that fled zoo spotted in Texas after 17 years,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/01/flamingo-kansas-fled-zoo-texas
4/1/2022,"Walking through Aberdeen one sunny Saturday lunchtime, I found Cafe 52 in a cobbled courtyard, just opening for lunch. The menu was full of delicious-sounding things such as cullen skink, hot smoked mackerel, and Normandy chicken casserole with leeks and tarragon. As I loitered by the door, something about the cafe’s name rang a bell, then, to my glee, I realised this was the place whose owner famously doesn’t like Guardian readers, and who earlier this year penned a job advert banning them. Perhaps I should have been offended, but there was a bread-and-butter pudding made with crumpets on the menu, plus, to quote Groucho Marx, “I refuse to join any club that would have me as a member.” No chef truly wants to see a restaurant critic waddle into view the moment they begin service, dip a finger in the demi-glace to check its consistency and behave as if a cold plate is the nadir of suffering, so I found it rather refreshing that the chef/owner here had already set out his stall that he had no time for my ilk. This charming, long, narrow strip of a bistro has survived for more than 25 years without the likes of me, and is these days serving a sort of boho, rustic, French-Scottish, casual-elegant menu to a unending stream of walk-ins. Cafe 52 has no need for my pronouncements. One of the very lovely servers squeezed me in ever so politely as a table for one and left me listening to Since You’ve Been Gone by Rainbow while trying to choose between the marinated herring with soured cream and walnuts and the portobello mushrooms cooked in cider. Could this really be the same controversial cafe? I popped to the ladies to wash my hands and found it freshly painted, a spotless sink, delightful hand soap and a large framed photograph of Mother Teresa bearing the words “Always wash your minge”. Yes, this must be the place. I like Aberdeen a great deal, and spent three wonderful days there alone, talking to strangers and eating: at the vegan Cafe Bonobo, where the thinly sliced carrot “smoked salmon” bagels are delightful; at steakhouse Vovem Meat & Liquor for pulled brisket mac ’n’ cheese; before heading farther afield to The Silver Darling on Pocra Quay for tempura oyster with wasabi. But Cafe 52 was my favourite. Proprietor Steve Bothwell might have little time for “liars” and “bullshitters”, as he says in that advert, but he has created a place where glorious food matters, and I can say beyond doubt that my restorative bowl of Normandy chicken casserole will be one of the greatest things I’ll eat all year. Chicken soup – or stew, in this case – does touch the soul, and a good one is as close to a cuddle from Mother T herself as you can get. This one featured five or six chunks of soft, stewed breast, thigh and leg in a clear tarragon broth with the very occasional chunk of soft potato or slice of garlicky mushroom, and was way more than the sum of its parts. This stew, topped with a vivid pink bundle of pickled red cabbage, was a wonder, with fragrant tarragon the hero ingredient. I ate it with a side of kale, deep fried and laced with chilli, which is the only way to treat it – that is, mercilessly, otherwise it’s really only good for hamster bedding. Bothwell’s octogenarian mother makes all the puddings at Cafe 52, and just two spoons into her crumpet bread-and-butter pudding I felt the need to check with the staff if anyone had written down the recipes for her carrot and brandied fruit cake or her coffee cake with rum syllabub. The bread pudding is a fearsome, rib-sticking challenge of a dessert, with crumpet after crumpet smothered in sweet, eggy custard and served with vanilla ice-cream. It’s the sort of dish that makes guests at other tables wink and wish me luck, as if I was some sort of amateur at this game. The first four or five spoons were sublime, all sticky and compelling; I was living my best life. After that, however, the going got tough. It felt ungracious to loosen my bra at the table, so I swiftly pencilled in an afternoon nap. It was at this point that the owner spotted me and made his way in the direction of my table. Oh dear, I thought, this is where things get even more tasty. “Yer stew all right?” he asked, semi-begrudgingly, as if he didn’t really care what the answer was going to be, but was curious anyway. “Incredible,” I said. “I loved it.” “Fine,” he said, and walked off without another glance in my direction. I have paved a way for all of us. Just don’t go in carrying this newspaper.  Cafe 52 52 The Green, Aberdeen AB11, 01224 590094. Open Wed-Sat, lunch noon-3pm, tapas 3-5pm, dinner 6-9pm.

4/1/2022,"Unless you’ve been living under a (Chris) Rock since last weekend, you’ll no doubt have seen the shocking footage of Will Smith’s Oscars outburst approximately 8,000 times already. In a fit of rage at a joke about wife Jada Pinkett Smith’s short hair – caused by the autoimmune condition alopecia – Smith slapped the comic on stage at the awards, before dropping a series of f-bombs. The grim ruckus has been analysed every which way this week, with a series of famous names – from Nicki Minaj to, er, Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak (cringe) – entering the fray to offer prognoses on Smith’s career, or merely to throw shade. Here are the Guide’s winners and losers of “slapgate”, in Hollywood and beyond. Will SmithUnsurprisingly, Smith has been squarely in the line of fire this week, with many appalled at his behaviour and the Academy launching an investigation into his conduct. OJ Simpson also came to his defence – arguably not the most welcome endorsement. Zoë KravitzUntil this week, the daughter of Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet was riding high. As well as winning the genetic lottery, she had recently received much acclaim for her performance as Catwoman alongside Robert Pattinson in The Batman. However, an Instagram reference to “the award show where we’re apparently assaulting people” led Twitter users to home in on seemingly suggestive comments Kravitz had made about Smith’s son Jaden when he was 14, and an interview where she said that she “didn’t identify with Black culture”, such as “hip-hop” and “Tyler Perry movies”. Jim CarreySimilarly, Carrey’s condemnation of “spineless” Hollywood prompted Twitter users to unearth a video of him lunging at Alicia Silverstone for a kiss at the 1997 MTV Movie Awards. Judd ApatowThe Knocked Up director went further in his criticism of Smith, saying that he “could’ve killed” Rock, and warning Amy Schumer not to attend the Vanity Fair Oscars afterparty. Many accused Apatow of double standards (James Franco was accused of assaulting Busy Phillips on his show Freaks and Geeks, for example) while writer Roxane Gay described it as “a wild thing to say”. Apatow later deleted his tweets. Alan DaviesThe opinion that no one wanted, but which we got nonetheless. The Jonathan Creek actor described Smith’s behaviour as “unreasonable”, before social media users reminded him that he himself once bit a homeless man, allegedly for referring to him by his most famous character’s name. The entire cast and crew of CodaThe majority-deaf drama scooped best picture … and has had roughly zero press since. A genuine tragedy. The OscarsJust when it looked like the biggest controversy was West Side Story actor Rachel Zegler’s invite getting lost in the post, a meh year for the Academy Awards was given a viral boost, with 500,000 viewers tuning in post-slap and millions more dissecting it online. Chris RockDespite making a documentary on black women’s complicated relationship with their hair, Rock still decided that Pinkett Smith’s alopecia was fair game. Even so, he’s come out on top, via much sympathy and an increase in sales for his upcoming tour. Liam PayneThe singer’s incoherent red carpet rant, complete with Irish (?) accent, was truly one of the more uplifting moments of the week. PfizerIf internet conspiracy theorists are to believed*, then Pfizer planned the whole thing to hawk a new alopecia drug. Result! *Please don’t actually believe them LaKeith StanfieldThe Atlanta actor expertly swerved questions from a Variety reporter on the night, describing it as “crazy … it was surreal … in places all over the world surreal stuff be happening”. Truly the Switzerland of the Academy. See also: Daniel Radcliffe, who declined to comment on the matter. Jada Pinkett SmithDespite the apparent humiliation Pinkett Smith suffered at the awards, she has garnered much sympathy. And although the actor has yet to comment on the incident directly, she has since described the present moment as “a season for healing”. Moreover, online searches for alopecia have spiked, with many sharing personal stories of how the condition has affected their lives. However, it’s unlikely she will stay stumm on things for long, her bread and butter these days being the online talkshow she presents with her mum, Adrienne, and daughter Willow.

4/1/2022,"You might imagine a column that ran for 10 years at the Guardian would have had some sophisticated conceptual origin. But How to eat – the series exploring the best way to enjoy Britain’s favourite dishes – was simply a hunch that stuck. Periodically, I and Susan Smillie, then editing the Guardian’s Word of Mouth blog before becoming food editor, would get wound up by examples of pompous food writing in which someone (usually, a posh, ruddy man in salmon trousers) hectored the reader about the correct way to eat oysters, quails’ eggs or English asparagus, as if it were a matter of life and (social) death. The superiority, the seriousness, the idea people were eating langoustines for tea on Tuesday nights, struck us as ridiculous. Would there be mileage, we wondered, in sending up such high-handed advice in a clearly tongue-in-cheek, OTT way? But by flipping the subject matter and talking enthusiastically about everyday foods – beans on toast, lasagne, pesto, Magnums, pasties, hummus – in a way that would generate engaged, friendly debate below the line (BTL)? Note: the bottom half of the internet was less toxic then. Fittingly, for a food column, How to eat wanted to have its cake and eat it. The views expressed were sincere and, in their finicky detail, reflect how we all develop idiosyncratic food habits. But its “rules” were not meant to be taken seriously. Florid language (“gustatory” in a tribute to Magnums), tortuous metaphors (why bacon on avocado toast is as unnecessary as the LCD Soundsystem reunion), and awful punning (offering readers “a penne for your thoughts”), were all whimsical nods and winks to treat How to eat with a pinch of salt. The series launched in March 2012 by dissecting the roast dinner, announcing that it would “fail but hopefully enjoyably so” in its attempt to settle on the meal’s ideal form. “The aim is not to establish rules but an informal code of good gastronomic conduct and have some fun while doing it,” ran the column’s mission statement. Immediately, we split opinion. And not just below the line. “It’s like a perfect satire,” wrote one anonymous Reddit user. Tim Hayward, now Financial Times restaurant critic, then a Guardian regular, complained to Smillie we were “trolling our own readers”. Naturally, some people got very angry. The implicit How to eat vibe was: please yourself, each to their own, crack on. I wasn’t going to come around and shout through your letterbox because you were serving (grotesque, medieval) bread sauce with Christmas dinner. But personal taste is sensitive. A cohort took How to eat at its word and saw any criticism of their dishes as an insult. Even under mildly amusing pieces about crumpets or coleslaw, the Guardian comment moderators had work to do. But, equally, lots of people got it – lots of people with fiercely held opinions about foods generally ignored by gourmet bores. The BTL debate (1,000+ comments about chips or lasagne, for example) was lively and exacting, fuelled by regulars such as Kizbot, tyorkshirelass, wjelly, Alexito, Nepthsolem SonOfTheDesert and Sybil Sanderson, without whom How to eat would just be an idiot shouting into the void about macaroni cheese. For some, the column offered genuine enlightenment. In an internal Guardian newsletter in 2020, then strategy manager Dominik Ebner, an Austrian, described the crisp sandwiches entry (the most talked-about ever; 1,729 comments) as “a key component of my education on all things British”. Forgive me, Britain. The philosopher and writer Julian Baggini, an early contributor BTL, finds it fascinating how, when discussing food, rather than holding true to the Latin maxim de gustibus non est disputandum (in matters of taste there can be no disputes), rational people “find themselves acting as though … the whole point is to dispute”. “Philosophers are drawn to aporias,” he emails, “two or more individually compelling but collectively incompatible claims. How to eat is the Platonic form of such a contradiction. It is absurd to say there is one right way to eat a food, and also obvious that cream before jam on a scone or pineapple on pizza is wrong. In philosophy such contradictions are torturous. With food, we get to enjoy them.” Or we did. For, after 10 years and 120 entries, How to eat has burped its last. With the exception of How to eat Creme Eggs (tip: teaspoon handle), I feel I have exhausted the items I can reasonably advance strong opinions about. But before I put my knife down, looking back on a decade of How to eat, what have we learned? 1 If you bravely challenge the cream tea orthodoxy of clotted cream (sickly density, curious, almost-curdled notes) and suggest topping scones with whipped cream, people lose it. “Sacrilege”, “heathen madness”, “death is too good for [him]” was the general tone. 2 Raw bell peppers, ruin of many a pizza or tuna sandwich mix (particularly, those bitter green vibe killers), have fewer supporters. Rise up, Britain, rise up! 3 Only psychopaths bite ice-cream. 4 Pushing pleasure over health, choosing butter and cheese over low-fat compromise, is controversial. The grilled full English is still wrong – no grease, no fun. 5 There is a sub-set of people who insist they can make perfect pizza or fish and chips at home, despite lacking a commercial frying range or a wood-fired 500C oven. This is baffling. Yes, you can make pizza at home but in the same way karaoke singers mimic Frank Sinatra – it may be enjoyable, but it is not the real thing. See also, making your own ketchup, artisan-craft arrogance that disregards the wonderful world of affordable sensory pleasure that industrial food processing has given us. 6 That said, the gastro-industrial complex is now running on fumes of novelty, endlessly fusing and abusing foods not because they taste good but because they sound exciting. That is why we have 1,001 supermarket “twists” on mince pies or sausages produced, it seems, by some random ingredient generator. But people seem to love it. Enjoy your Korean fried sprout hummus, Britain. You deserve it. 7 Bowls are brilliant: encircling warmth, items conveniently confined in one place, a sense of nourishing depth as you dig in. Big plates are passé. 8 Mint sauce? Cranberry sauce? Bread sauce? Supporters will argue their case with an unrivalled vociferousness. Poor misguided souls. 9 Where practical, diners should be enabled to combine meal components to their taste. Rather than pre-sauced plates, How to eat pushed the gravy boat (currently as hip as skiffle or Trotskyism), and argued smoked salmon should be served alongside rather than pre-sliced and mixed through scrambled eggs. (This plea for greater personal agency in food largely fell on deaf ears.) 10 How to eat was often wrong but its 2012 backing of the all-conquering potential of Neapolitan-style pizza was Nostradamus-like. 11 Some of food’s biggest flashpoints: yorkshire puddings (generally), hash browns (on a full breakfast), tubs versus cones for ice-cream, pot “pies” and tinned mushrooms (OK, that was mainly me). 12 Talking of triggers, vegans and vegetarians are sick of meat-eaters questioning why they choose to eat dishes that mimic meat. I still don’t understand it. But I have come to accept it is not my business. 13 We all deserve “tantric chocolate”, whether that means lingering over a melting chunk or inverting a teaspoon of Nutella, lodging it in the roof of your mouth and slowly licking it clean. 14 There are certain foods – ice-cream, chips, cheese, crisps, toast – that, even at their worst, are still enjoyable. As How to eat put it in 2012: “With its killer combination of fat, salt and umami, it is impossible to be a snob about cheese.” This, it transpires, is not a universal view. 15 Structural integrity is essential. Tinker for weeks with your burger’s beef cuts and fat ratios, but if the bun falls apart midway, who cares? The best hotdog toppings drape securely over a sausage. Goujons may sound better on a gastropub menu but, in a sandwich, those slippery devils are less secure than rectilinear fish fingers. This stuff matters. You should not have to grapple with food. Yet, when How to eat suggested lightly hardening the yolk in a fried egg sandwich to a fudgy consistency, so it doesn’t squirt everywhere, it was treated as killjoy clickbait. 16 Talking of takeaways … if you read How to eat’s intros (did anyone?), you would have learned, variously, that the avocado’s original Nahuatl name, āhuacatl, also means testicle; that ancient Roman lasagne comprised thrush, tripe and raisin wine (tuck in!); Roger Moore (possibly, maybe) inspired the Magnum by floating the idea of a choc ice on a stick in a magazine interview; and that the Germans have a word, knack, for the crack of a hotdog’s skin. Those intros were a rich seam of useless, engaging trivia. 17 Hipster foods may be hyped but are they embedded in the nation’s heart? Avocado toast’s paltry 145 comments (lowest ever? 65 for chocolate brownies!), suggests not. Should How to eat have been on TikTok? 18 Make a mess. Proudly wear your dinner. Get the kitchen roll on the table. Or just wipe your hands on your jeans. How to eat spent a lot of time debunking the myths of good manners: tip that soup bowl towards you; eat on the bus; chill out about double-dipping (this was pre-Covid). Hopefully, we’ve moved on from the awkwardness of etiquette to a more informal enjoyment of food. How to eat was of course pro-dunking, in which the ginger snap and the milk chocolate digestive achieve perfection. 19 When you start talking about how acrid bitterness is a positive characteristic in food and drink (grapefruit, coffee, slightly burned jacket potatoes, west coast IPAs), people start looking at you funny. 20 Even when offered a rigorous definition (Are they sold in the crisp aisle? Would you eat them in a pub? Do you ever think about putting them in a sandwich? If yes to all three, that is a crisp), people will still argue endlessly that, because they are not made from fried potatoes, Doritos or Monster Munch are not crisps. In short, people really like arguing. On pies: “You cannot serve a bowl of stew with a puff pastry lid, and pretend that’s pie. A pub pie without a bottom is like casual sex. It feels great after six pints, but, ultimately, it’s baseless, unsatisfying and leaves everyone feeling cheap.” On biscuits: “Only the most patriotic Scots pretend to like shortbread. It’s like Runrig. And Rab C Nesbitt.” On fish fingers: “Fish fingers were launched in the UK using a slogan that could be said to encapsulate the British psyche: ‘No bones, no waste, no smell, no fuss.’” On ice-cream: “Like Jay-Z, I have 99 problems. Cold chocolate doesn’t work. The pleasure of chocolate is it melts in your mouth – which isn’t going to happen eating it, simultaneously, with ice-cream.” On chips: “Jenga stacks, dinky stainless buckets, twee mini-frying baskets, fake newspaper cones, these all prompt one question: where are the rest of my chips, chef? I count eight. This is a joke.” On lasagne: “Like a good U2 song, impressive vegetable lasagne is possible but so vanishingly rare as to be statistically insignificant. For every exquisite artichoke or wild mushroom [version], there are 10,000 lumpen veggie lasagnes layered with a ‘Mediterranean’ vegetable slurry that has all the sunshine flavour of an abandoned graveyard in Telford.” On baked beans: “A word on homemade beans: no.” On crisp sandwiches: “The idea on a crisp butty you would deny yourself butter on health grounds and instead subject yourself to one of the light ’n’ spreadable, sterol-and-stanol, I-never-believed-it-wasn’t-butter vegetable oil options is baffling. You. Are. Eating. A. Crisp. Sandwich … It is an all-in, sod-the-consequences commitment.” On avocados: “The smashing must be done by hand using a fork to avoid a wet, fluffy, machine-processed texture. You want it smooth but dense, like Michelin-starred mashed potatoes or Dominic Raab.” On cookies: “British biscuits are black and white TV. The cookie is Imax.”",Lifestyle/Food,"After 10 years of turning every meal into an argument, How to eat is calling it a day",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/01/after-10-years-of-turning-every-meal-into-an-argument-how-to-eat-is-calling-it-a-day
4/1/2022,"Giant orchids that can reach a metre tall have officially been found growing wild in the UK for the first time, having become established hundreds of miles north of their native range in the Mediterranean. The “stately” plants were discovered on a grassy slope near Didcot in Oxfordshire by Hamza Nobes, a 29-year-old trainee nurse, who wishes to keep the exact location a secret. Nobes was out on a walk when he saw the pink flower five metres away from the path and assumed it was a butterbur, but clambered down the steep slope to get a better look, and then realised what he had found. The sweet-smelling orchid has many flowers on its stem, which are purplish-red in colour, and the leaves are broad and glossy. “I was ecstatic. I’ve never really found anything, and I’m not a botanist in any way shape or form,” said Nobes, who has been interested in orchids for two years. Typically found in southern and central Europe, the giant orchid (Himantoglossum robertianum) range is expanding north as the climate warms, with records showing the plant is able to survive in northern France and the Netherlands. “It was weird, because a few weeks prior I was looking through my European orchid book and I was looking at the giant orchid and thought that’s such a beautiful orchid, it would be lovely to see one day, maybe in Greece or somewhere, but really it was just 10 minutes from my house,” he said. It is not believed these plants arrived naturally, but rather by someone scattering seeds about 15 years ago, a practice discouraged by ecologists as it can result in invasive species. It is believed this is also how the species reached the Netherlands. In both cases, they managed to establish and are now reproducing themselves. Locals say the plants flowered years ago and then vanished, but no official report was ever made. This year – perhaps benefiting from the sunny spring – there are nine flowering plants and 10 non-flowering plants, reaching a maximum of 30cm tall. “It’s a very exciting find,” said Prof Ian Denholm, from the University of Hertfordshire, who is one of the UK’s two national orchid referees and visited the site to verify the find. “There was a [giant orchid] seen about 15 years ago, it wasn’t widely reported and it came as news to me in fact … it was never really made public, and the plant itself presumably didn’t last very long,” said Denholm. Orchid flowers consist of three outer sepals and three inner petals, and in many species, one of the petals is highly modified as a lip to attract pollinators and give them a place to land. The giant orchid lip has lobes that fancifully resemble arms and legs, says Denholm. “It’s a very stately orchid. It lives up to its name of giant orchid. It’s got quite a long and dense flower spike.” Orchids are good at telling us about the consequences of global heating, because there are so many orchid enthusiasts out recording changes in their range over time. Given the expansion of its range, experts say it’s feasible the giant orchid may have naturally colonised the UK at some point in the future. There have been other reports of the tiny seeds of European orchid species blowing over the Channel to the southern counties of the UK, where they are increasingly able to survive. Last year, a colony of small-flowered tongue orchids – thought to be extinct in the UK – were discovered on the rooftop of an investment bank in the City of London. They are typically associated with central and southern Europe, and it is not known how the seeds arrived there. “I always welcome new stuff,” said Sean Cole, a field naturalist and co-author of Britain’s Orchids. He said the find was another indication that our climate can increasingly support Mediterranean species. “We’ve got 53 or 54 species of orchids anyway, anything new is nice to have. It’s not really going to impede on anything else around it or take over. It comes from the near continent, so it’s kind of semi-natural to us, it’s not going to take over like Japanese knotweed or something.” The orchid, which flowers in March, has proven a hit with early pollinators, including bumblebees, which have been seen on the flowers. “Our local bees have welcomed them, so then why shouldn’t we?” said Cole. The Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland has a network of people who maintain local records and has been made aware of the discovery. Giant orchids are a non-native plants, so have no statutory protection. Orchid enthusiasts are now in communication with the owner of the site and are discussing how best to protect it.",News/Environment,Giant orchids found growing wild in UK for first time,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/01/giant-orchids-found-growing-wild-in-uk-for-first-time
4/1/2022,"The websites of energy providers are struggling to cope with a deluge of traffic on “bleak Friday”, as the largest increase in gas and electricity prices in living memory takes effect on the same day as scheduled rises to taxes and household services. Customers in Great Britain seeking cheaper energy bills had been advised to submit meter readings online before Friday’s 54% increase to the cap on the average annual bill rises to £1,971, putting unprecedented pressure on the websites of suppliers. The meter reading page of British Gas, one of the UK’s biggest suppliers, was displaying an error message on Friday morning, while E.ON and EDF were also battling outages. Households face multiple price increases from 1 April, from council tax and VAT on pints to broadband and phone bills, all adding to the cost of living crisis, with inflation forecast to hit a 40-year high this year. As snow and hail fell across the UK this week, families and pensioners spoke of having to turn off the heating and disconnect broadband in order to afford the rising cost of food. However, those with prepayment meters who stop using them will still find they are running up gas and electricity bills because of rising weekly standing charges of up to £6.15, despite having no power for heating, light or cooking. From today people on prepayment meters who run out of money and disconnect themselves from electricity or gas will find their electric meter will still be ticking up at £3.53 a week standing charge and the gas meter at £2.62 – £6.15 a week to be without heat, light, or cooking. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said the number of English households in “fuel stress” had doubled overnight, from 2.5m to 5m. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) called for an emergency budget to help working families who were at “breaking point”, as Citizens Advice estimated that about 5 million people would be unable to pay their energy bills from this month. The TUC said the measures announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in last week’s spring statement were “woefully inadequate”, as UK households faced the biggest fall in living standards since the 1950s. “People shouldn’t be struggling to cover the basics but millions of families have been pushed to the breaking point by spiralling bills and soaring inflation,” said Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC. “This is a living standards emergency. Rishi Sunak must come to parliament and present an emergency budget. We need a proper package of economic support for families. Britain faces the worst living standards crisis in generations. We need an emergency budget to bring down energy bills and to boost pay, universal credit and pensions.” Energy bills would rise 10 times faster than wages this year, said the TUC, as it joined the Labour party in calling for a windfall tax on the billions in profits made by oil and gas companies to pay for its proposed package of support measures. “People don’t want a revolution, they do want to know how to pay their energy bills,” said the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, during an interview on Friday morning.
