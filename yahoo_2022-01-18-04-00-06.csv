1/18/2022,"Golden State Warriors owner Chamath Palihapitiya suggested recently that “nobody cares” about China’s system of concentration camps, forced labor, and high-tech surveillance against the Uyghur community in Xinjiang. “Nobody cares about what’s happening to the Uyghurs, okay,” Palihapitiya said during an appearance on the All-In podcast. “You bring it up because you care and I think it’s nice that you care. The rest of us don’t care. I’m just telling you a very hard, ugly truth. Of all the things that I care about, yes, it is below my line.” He went on to list other issues that occupy his focus, including climate change, the potential economic fallout of China invading Taiwan, and U.S. stores not having stocked shelves. The Warriors part-owner said that if America is able to find solutions to all of its own issues then he might shift focus to the oppression of the Uyghurs. The comments were reminiscent of that of another NBA owner, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who said in October 2020 that he is “against human rights violations around the world,” though he is “OK doing business with China,” where more than one million Muslims have been imprisoned in concentration camps because “we have to pick our battles.” Cuban’s comments came during an appearance on The Megyn Kelly Show podcast, in which the former Fox News and NBC News host asked why Cuban and the NBA wouldn’t “explicitly condemn” the numerous human rights abuses being carried out by the Chinese government, including the ethnic cleansing of Muslims, torture, forced labor, coercive population controls, forced abortions and forced sterilizations. “I personally put a priority on domestic issues. I’m against human rights violations around the world,” Cuban said at the time. When Kelly pushed back, asking if that included violations in China, Cuban replied, “China is not the only country with human rights violations.” After further pressing, Cuban said, “Yes, including China. Any human rights violations anywhere are wrong,” though he listed other countries where human rights violations occur, including Turkey and some African countries.  Meanwhile, Boston Celtics star Enes Kanter has been outspoken in calling out China for its human rights atrocities and in calling out the NBA and his fellow players, including LeBron James, for their silence on the issue and their willingness to continue to do business with China. Kanter said in November that NBA commissioner Adam Silver affirmed his right to speak out against injustice in China, despite one of his previous protests against China’s treatment of Tibet having led to the Chinese video-streaming site Tencent pulling the Celtics’ season opener.

1/18/2022,"By Olga Yagova MOSCOW (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s planned purchase of Polish refining assets is set to put OPEC's top producer in charge of two thirds of Poland's oil supply, eroding previously dominant supplier Russia's leverage as it grapples with regional tension. Poland has a long history of seeking to reduce its dependence on Russian energy imports through deals with alternative suppliers and its determination has grown as relations have worsened. In recent months, Moscow and Warsaw have clashed over the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that bypasses shared neighbour Ukraine, as well as a migrant crisis involving another joint neighbour Belarus. The mood between Poland and Russia had already darkened over oil supplies early in 2021 when Poland had to cut its oil purchases from Russia because of a price row between Russia's Rosneft and Poland's PKN Orlen. Last Wednesday, the Saudi state oil giant said it had agreed to buy a 30% stake in Poland's second largest refinery and to increase oil supplies to the state's top energy firm PKN Orlen to 200,000-337,000 barrels per day (bpd). Gdansk oil refinery's capacity is 210,000 bpd, second only in Poland to state's oil refinery Plock, with about 270,000 bpd. ""We value our business relationships with both Russian partners and other suppliers of crude oil to our refineries,"" PKN Orlen said in an emailed answer to Reuters questions. It said it did not intend ""to discontinue business with Russian partners"", while refusing to disclose details of its trade contracts. In reply to an emailed request for comment, Saudi Aramco said it ""cannot provide further details on the deal"". Russia's Energy Ministry, Russia's pipeline monopoly Transneft and Rosneft did not reply to Reuters' requests for comment. POLITICS VERSUS ECONOMICS Poland is one of the most significant oil consumers in Baltics and its PKN Orlen holds stakes in refineries in Lithuania and the Czech Republic, which are also buyers of Russia’s flagship Urals crude. Provided the deal is finalised, Aramco will raise its oil supply to Poland by between three and five times and may meet between 50% and 70% of Poland's crude oil needs, Reuters calculations found. Medium sour Saudi crude is technically well-suited to Polish refineries configured to handle Russian Urals, which is also sour, or high in sulphur, but the logistics of shipping into the region could add to costs compared with importing Russian Baltic cargoes, Viktor Katona from independent consultancy JBC Energy told Reuters. ""Poland's aim to achieve independence from Russian supplies is primarily politically driven,"" Katona said, adding any reduction in spot purchasing and in market outlets would hurt Russian oil exporters. Already, Saudi Arabia is supplying around 90,000 bpd of seaborne crude to Poland's Gdansk, compared with around 142,000 bpd of Russian Urals shipped via the same route, Katona said. Poland's seaborne imports, which also include North Sea and West African grades, have risen as volumes through the old Soviet Union Druzhba oil pipline to Poland have declined, reflecting the political and also technical problems of recent years. This month Russia is expected to supply 120,000 bpd of oil via Druzhba compared to some 220,000 bpd in January 2021, according to two industry sources and Eikon data. That compares with up to 500,000 bpd in the mid 2000s. Two sources close to the Saudi deal said it mattered considerably to Poland, but was unlikely to have any bearing on internal politics within the OPEC+ group, which brings together the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other big producers, notably Russia. While united on the need to support prices through output agreements, Russia and Saudi Arabia are used to competing for market share and could even deliver a lesson to the West in pragmatic management of relationships based on rivalry, one of the sources said. ""Anyone can invest anywhere,"" the source close to the deal said on condition of anonymity. The source cited Rosneft's 2017 investment in India’s Essar, in which Aramco had also been interested.

1/18/2022,"Scott Quiner had been fighting COVID-19 on a ventilator for months in Minnesota, but after a life-or-death legal fight with his hospital, his family is moving him to Texas for treatment, outlets report. Quiner, a 55-year-old man from Buffalo, MN, was diagnosed with COVID-19 in late October, the Star Tribune reported. By Nov. 6, he was transferred to Mercy Hospital and put on a ventilator — and it’s kept him breathing since. Quiner was unvaccinated, the outlet reported. After more than two months on the machine, Quiner’s doctors decided to take him off of it on Jan. 13, court documents show. His wife, Anne Quiner, filed a lawsuit to stop the hospital from removing the ventilator, an action which would “end my husband’s life,” an affidavit read. “I am in the process of finding a new facility to provide care for my husband but need more time,” it said. According to reports, Anne Quiner also asked doctors to try other treatments and drugs. What those alternative treatments were isn’t clear, but the doctors refused. Lawyers for the hospital argued that Quiner’s position “is not supported by medical science or Minnesota law,” documents show. Ultimately, a judge granted a restraining order to keep Scott Quiner on the ventilator, and another hearing was set for Feb. 11. Marjorie Holsten, a lawyer representing the Quiners, told TV station KMSP that Scott Quiner was flown by helicopter to a hospital somewhere in Texas. McClatchy News reached out to Holsten for comment. Holsten’s social media shows a history of skepticism toward the scientific community and articles sharing COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. The attorney told KMSP that she expects Scott Quiner’s condition to improve at the Texas hospital. “And as he gets better and better, we are going to see that you know what, there are protocols that should be used that hospitals have not been using,” Holsten told the outlet. “And I am hoping that changes are going to be made as a result of this case.” Allina Health, which operates Mercy Hospital, where Quiner was being treated in Minnesota, confirmed that he was transferred to a Texas facility, outlets reported. “The patient was transported to a health care facility of the family’s choice (Saturday morning),” according to a statement obtained by KARE. “Allina Health is grateful the family was able to find a health care facility that meets their needs and we continue to wish them all the best.” After omicron’s surge, will variant cases slow down?

1/18/2022,"A man accused of pushing an Asian woman in front of an oncoming subway train in New York City has a criminal history dating back to 1998, police told reporters.

The fatal attack, which authorities deemed “unprovoked,” occurred at Times Square-42nd Street subway station at around 9:40 a.m. on Saturday.

Michelle Alyssa Go, 40, was waiting for a southbound R train when Simon Martial, 61, allegedly shoved her onto the tracks.

Martial, who was reported to be homeless, fled the scene but turned himself in less than an hour later, CNN reported.

Police charged Martial with second-degree murder. When reporters asked about his motive, he said the victim “stole my f*cking jacket,” according to the New York Post.

Martial also claimed to be god. “Yeah, because I’m God,” he said. “Yes, I did. I’m God, I can do it.”

However, New York City Police Department Commissioner Keechant Sewell said the incident appears to be “unprovoked.” She told reporters that “the victim does not appear to have [had] any interaction with the subject.”

A second woman alleged that Martial approached her before he approached Go. But the woman, who is not Asian, was able to keep her distance.

“He approaches her and he gets in her space. She gets very, very alarmed,” said New York Police Department Assistant Chief Jason Wilcox, according to Fox News.

“She tries to move away from him and he gets close to her, and she feels that he was about to physically push her onto the train,” Wilcox continued. “As she’s walking away she witnesses the crime where he pushes our other victim in front of the train.”

Wilcox said Martial has a criminal history, noting “three emotionally disturbed encounters” on record. He was arrested in 1998 and again in 2017 for attempting to rob taxi drivers, according to WABC.

Martial has been arrested 10 times since 1998, New York Daily News reported. While the latest attack is not being ruled as a hate crime, it has nonetheless struck fear in the Asian American community.

“This latest attack causing the death of an Asian American woman in the Times Square subway station is particularly horrifying for our community,” said Margaret Fung, executive director of the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, according to KARE 11. “These attacks have left Asian Americans across the city and across the country feeling vulnerable and they must stop.”

Phil Wong, a businessman and political activist from Queens, attributed the community’s fear in part to District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s “lenient sentencing guidelines.” The lawyer of a man accused of attacking and robbing a Korean American good Samaritan in Midtown on Wednesday cited those policies in demanding the release of his client, who is a repeat offender.

“People are afraid because we know [Bragg] is going to let violent criminals go free and Asians around the city will be the victims,” Wong told the New York Post.

Mayor Eric Adams, on the other hand, stressed the importance of addressing mental health in the city. Earlier this month, Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-N.Y.) announced an initiative called Safe Options Support (SOS), which will “embed” trained professionals — including medical professionals and social workers — to reach and offer resources to homeless people.

“We want to continue to highlight how imperative it is that people receive the right mental health services, particularly on our subway system,” Adams said. “To lose a New Yorker in this fashion will only continue to elevate the fears of individuals not using our subway system.”

The train operator who witnessed the recent incident reportedly suffered from“incredible trauma” and was taken to Bellevue Hospital.

“Our hearts go out to the victim, obviously, but also to the train operator who has incredible trauma from having, unfortunately, experienced that moment when somebody was pushed in front of his train,” Metropolitan Transportation Authority Acting Chair Janno Lieber said, according to People.

Canella Gomez, vice president of the Transport Workers Union Local 100, described the incident as “the part of the job that no one is ever truly physically, mentally or emotionally prepared for,” reported New York Daily News.

“No train operator comes to work expecting to have a passenger thrown in front of his or her train,” Gomez said.

1/18/2022,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) -A fourth shot of COVID-19 vaccine boosts antibodies to even higher levels than the third jab but it is not enough to prevent Omicron infections, according to a preliminary study in Israel. Israel's Sheba Medical Center has given second booster shots in a trial among its staff and is studying the effect of the Pfizer booster in 154 people after two weeks and the Moderna booster in 120 people after one week, said Gili Regev-Yochay, director of the Infectious Diseases Unit. These were compared to a control group that did not receive the fourth shot. Those in the Moderna group had previously received three shots of Pfizer's vaccine, the hospital said. The vaccines led to a increase in the number of antibodies ""even a little bit higher than what we had after the third dose"", said Regev-Yochay. ""Yet, this is probably not enough for the Omicron,"" she told reporters. ""We know by now that the level of antibodies needed to protect and not to got infected from Omicron is probably too high for the vaccine, even if it's a good vaccine."" The findings, which the hospital said were the first of its kind in the world, were preliminary and not yet published. Israel was the fastest country to roll out initial vaccinations against COVID-19 a year ago and last month started offering a fourth shot, or a second booster, to the most vulnerable and high-risk groups.
