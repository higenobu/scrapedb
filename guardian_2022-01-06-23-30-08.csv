1/6/2022,"A former student who was told to read classic literature after being convicted of a terrorism offence has told the sentencing judge he “enjoyed Shakespeare more than Jane Austen”. Ben John, who downloaded almost 70,000 white supremacist documents and bomb-making instructions, was given a two-year suspended prison sentence at Leicester crown court in August last year.  John was told to read famous works of literature including Pride and Prejudice, Twelfth Night and A Tale of Two Cities as part of a five-year serious crime prevention order. At a review hearing on Thursday, the judge Timothy Spencer QC asked for an update on which books John had read and what he thought of them. “I want you to write down now what literature you have read since we last met,” he said. John said: “I enjoyed Shakespeare more than I did Jane Austen but I still enjoyed Jane Austen by a degree.” “Well I find that encouraging,” the judge replied. Spencer told John he acknowledged “publicity of this case” had affected his rehabilitation. John, 21, from Lincoln was found guilty by a jury of possessing a record of information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. The charge under section 58 of the Terrorism Act, which has a maximum sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment, was brought after the discovery on a computer of a publication containing diagrams and instructions on how to construct explosive devices. Police said John had also amassed 67,788 documents in bulk downloads on to hard drives, containing a wealth of white supremacist and antisemitic material. They said he had become part of the extreme right wing (XRW) online, and was studying criminology with psychology in Leicester when he was arrested. During sentencing, the judge said John had avoided imprisonment by “the skin of his teeth”. The attorney general has asked the court of appeal to review the “unduly lenient” sentence handed to the defendant. The decision by Suella Braverman QC to refer the sentence to the court of appeal came after anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate sent an open letter asking for the it to be reconsidered. Hope Not Hate’s chief executive, Nick Lowles, said: “These sorts of lenient sentences risk encouraging other young people to access and share terrorist and extremist content because they will not fear the repercussions of their actions.” John was told to attend court again in six months’ time when the judge would check his progress. “It is clear that you have tried to sort your life out. I am encouraged about what you have written out for me and I am encouraged by your efforts to seek employment and I wish you well with that,” Spencer said.",News/Law,Extremist told to read classics by UK judge ‘enjoyed Shakespeare more than Austen’,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/06/extremist-told-to-read-classics-by-uk-judge-enjoyed-shakespeare-more-than-austen
1/6/2022,"The special House committee investigating the 6 January 2021 insurrection by extremist supporters of then-president Donald Trump are hoping to secure the cooperation of the former vice-president, Mike Pence, who certified Joe Biden’s election victory despite pressure from the White House and the violent mob that broke into the US Capitol. Congresswoman Liz Cheney, deputy chair of the bipartisan panel, called Pence a hero for standing up to Donald Trump’s efforts to “overthrow the will of the people” that day and said that the committee is “looking forward” to working with him.  “We look forward to continuing the cooperation we’ve had from members of the former vice-president’s team and look forward to his cooperation,” Cheney said in an interview with the NBC Today show on Thursday morning. She said: “Former vice-president Pence was a hero on 6 January. He refused the pressures of the former president, he did his duty and the nation should be very grateful for the actions he took that day.” The panel is chaired by the Democratic congressman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who told CNN: “We came perilously close to losing our democracy” when thousands of supporters of Trump, egged on by the then-president in the dying days of his one-term presidency, charged the US Capitol on 6 January last year trying to stop members of Congress, who had to flee, from officially certifying Biden’s election victory in November 2020. The election result was certified hours later after the Capitol had been cleared, with the official act being presided over by Pence, in the vice-president’s role as president of the Senate. Cheney, the Republican congresswoman representing Wyoming, and the daughter of former vice-president Dick Cheney, who served in the George W Bush administration, spoke of Trump putting Pence under pressure to refuse to certify Biden’s victory and of the then-president’s failure to demand that the mob leave the Capitol even as he watched the violent insurrection on live television at the White House. Asked if the panel was considering recommending criminal charges against Trump, Cheney said: “Certainly we will be looking at that, there are important questions in front of the committee such as whether the action or inaction of former president Trump attempted to obstruct an official proceeding of Congress, attempted to delay the count of electoral votes.” She added: “We also know that it was a supreme dereliction of duty, the president of the US refuses to take action to stop a violent assault on the Congress, to stop a violent assault on any of the co-equal branches of government, that’s clearly a dereliction of duty.” Trump has asked the US supreme court to block the release by the National Archives to the committee of relevant materials relating to his conduct on 6 January last year and in the run-up to that event, the most serious assault on the US Capitol since the war of 1812. Trump claims he is protected by executive privilege because he was president at the time, a claim rejected by the Biden White House and lower courts. Cheney said: “We will not let the former president hide behind these phony claims of privilege and we will get to the bottom of … everything that was going on that day.” Asked if the US came close to the results of the valid presidential election being overthrown, Cheney said the country “came very close”. “Our institutions held but they only held because of people who were willing to stand up against the pressure from former president Trump, people in his own Department of Justice … elected officials at the state level who stood up to him and the law enforcement officers here at the Capitol. We need to recognize how important it is … that it never happens again.”",News/US news,US Capitol attack: Liz Cheney says Mike Pence ‘was a hero’ on 6 January,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/06/us-capitol-attack-liz-cheney-mike-pence-hero
1/6/2022,"When Shaparak Khorsandi’s teenage son recently discovered 90s music – the Shamen’s Ebeneezer Good, Pulp and more – he had questions for her. What did Jarvis Cocker mean when he sang “I seem to have left an important part of my brain somewhere, somewhere in a field in Hampshire?” Were they singing about ecstasy? Did she go raving, too? Khorsandi was in her teens and 20s in the 1990s, and being swept along in ladette culture. Used by the lads’ mag FHM as early as 1994, “ladette” came to describe bolshie women who could out-party and out-gross any hardened lad. Sara Cox, Denise van Outen and Zoe Ball were the media favourites: often pictured binge-drinking and out on the town. Ladettes went hand-in-hand with 90s lad culture, where Britpop, banter and sport collided in a blizzard of hedonism. These “new lads”, posited one researcher, were retreating into a more simplistic masculinity in response to the Spice Girls’ concept of Girl Power; and middle-class boys were co-opting the dress and behaviours of working-class men.  Writing her latest show, It Was the 90s!, for the Edinburgh fringe last summer, Khorsandi reflected on the decade. “We’ve glossed over ladette culture a bit; it’s been fun to revisit it,” she says. “It was initially meant to be a feminist action. We thought we were taking power back by making ourselves very ill with booze and selling ourselves short when we went out. The men do it, so should we! But what we didn’t have, which my son’s generation has, was the notion of self-care.” It Was the 90s! delves into Khorsandi’s time as a ladette and how attitudes have changed. What do we dismiss under the guise of nostalgia? Was the pressure to go out every night, drink until you were sick, and separate sex from emotions really as good as she thought at the time? Khorsandi explores it all. “The way I deal with bad times is to make them funny and this is the most fun show I’ve done,” she says. “This is an honest conversation between 23-year-old me and 48-year-old me.” Khorsandi started out in comedy in the 90s. “Standup then was the closest thing I had to punk. We just drank until some kind of career happened or you died. There were no other women that I worked with, and it was all about being as hard and as gross as you could.” Esther Manito has also been looking back on 90s ladette culture in her show #NotAllMen, which won the Leicester comedy festival’s best show award in 2021. She comes on stage to Robin Thicke’s Blurred Lines and opens with: “Do we have any violent misogynists in?” Growing up, Manito would spend summer holidays in Beirut. Friends would ask: was it safe? In reality, her happy experiences in Lebanon stood in stark contrast to simply walking home from school in Essex, where she faced catcalls almost daily. The female empowerment she was fed through pop culture back then was incredibly lacking. “We weren’t allowed feminism in the 90s,” Manito jokes in her show. “We had the Spice Girls.” During the pandemic, living with her Lebanese father, British husband and son, Manito began to explore masculinity and how its expectations can damage men. She spoke to old school friends about the way lockdown pushed many couples into stereotypical gender roles. One friend found a list Manito had written as a teenager, detailing the qualities of her dream boyfriend, including: “Must not touch me with the light on.” “That projection of what a woman’s body was through lads’ magazines meant I was really self-conscious,” Manito says. She had grown up in a progressive, feminist household, so the pressure to conform felt doubly bad. “I thought: I’m not this hairless, skinny, big-titted, oiled-up figure, and I don’t want to be.” She recalls a column where Zoo magazine’s agony uncle Danny Dyer suggested a man who’d split with his girlfriend should “cut your ex’s face” so no one else would date her. (He later claimed he was misquoted.) Such flagrant misogyny, she thought, must affect how boys and men interacted with women. “Looking at my husband and others, I think it took them a really long time to be able to have relationships with women that weren’t sexual,” she says. While some of this was “shocking” to look back on, “you find humour in the bizarre”, she says. Both Manito and Khorsandi recall being labelled “shouty” or “fiery” after voicing their opinions. Khorsandi “cultivated a posh accent” because she was made to feel like “I couldn’t be brown and working class”. She shortened her name to Shappi because “I was so ashamed every time anyone said ‘Shaparak’ out loud because there’d be titters of laughter.” This is the first full tour she’s performing as Shaparak.Khorsandi received an ADHD diagnosis earlier this year – another prompt for reflection. Was it partly her undiagnosed ADHD that drew her into ladette behaviour? “Looking back, the booze medicated my ADHD,” she says. “I think not understanding about self-care and neurodivergence played into the 90s binge-drinking culture.” Looking back has made them both appreciate where society is today. “I definitely don’t feel nostalgia for the 90s!” Manito says. “I don’t want to be stuck in my youth,” says Khorsandi. “I’ve watched how things have changed my standup and values have changed. Comedy is part of culture – it all moves forward.” Both women have noticed a refreshing acceptance among their children’s generation. “There’s no othering,” Manito says. “I’ve never heard my boy say: ‘Girls can’t do that’, something I always heard growing up. I think my kids will face fewer hurdles when it comes to creating connections with people.” “The tolerance they have for one another is astounding,” Khorsandi agrees. “It doesn’t occur to my son’s generation to be negative about someone who is transitioning or non-binary. I had to explain to my children that ginger people used to get teased at school. They looked at me like: ‘Are you mad?!’ Things have really changed.” Shaparak Khorsandi’s It Was the 90s! tour resumes 21 January at Otley Courthouse; Esther Manito is at the Beck theatre, Hayes, Friday 7 January, and performs #NotAllMen at the Glee Club, Birmingham, 22 April",Arts/Stage,‘We had the Spice Girls’: the two comics unpicking ladette culture,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/06/we-werent-allowed-feminism-we-had-the-spice-girls-the-two-comics-unpicking-ladette-culture
1/6/2022,"Around half-five on the second afternoon, Joe Root turned, again, to Stuart Broad, and asked him to come back for his sixth spell of the innings. The sun was a little lower, but other than that the only thing that had changed since he finished his last, less than an hour previous, was that Australia had pressed further ahead. The two batsmen Broad had been bowling to then, Usman Khawaja and Mitchell Starc, were still in, and that much better set, Mark Wood had run out of luck, James Anderson had run out of inspiration, the partnership was up to 40 runs and Australia were closing in on a total of 400. Whatever little flutter of hope England had when the last wicket fell had faded away again, and left everyone who shared in it feeling all the more foolish for thinking it would ever be any other way. Which fits. The decision to leave Broad out of the team for the two of the first three Tests was a poor bit of judgment that will come to define this tour, as well as the career of the coach who made it. Like Broad said, given the way England batted in those matches picking him wouldn’t have made so very much difference. But it would have at least shown that the management knew who was in their own best XI.  Now he had been selected, Broad didn’t need much persuading to come back for that extra spell. He needed one more wicket for his five-for, and a place on the SCG honours board alongside his dad Chris, who made a century there in 1988. It had been 18 months since Broad last took five wickets in an innings, against the West Indies at Old Trafford in 2020. Of course he missed the last few months of that stretch after he tore his calf during a training session before the second Test against India during the summer just gone. It was a bad injury, which needed surgery, and three months of recuperation. Kevin Pietersen warned Broad that a similar injury had finished his own playing career. Broad is 35, and has a second life lined up in TV, there must have been times when it felt touch and go whether it would end his too. For the first two weeks, he couldn’t even put weight on his foot. After that, there were the long hours treading water in a swimming pool, followed, as he got fitter, by lonely road and gym sessions, then trips to Wimbledon Cricket Club to take tentative steps in the nets, and solitary journeys up to Loughborough to bowl stretches of 10, 12, 14 overs in front of his rehab team. At the front of his mind all the time, the lure of one more tour to Australia, and the prospect of taking the new ball in the first innings at Brisbane, and bowling to David Warner again. The promise of it got him through. Of course it didn’t work out the way he’d dreamed it, it rarely does. Broad has ended up a bit-part player on tour, picked for one Test on a flat track in Adelaide and then another now the series is over already. There was a time he would have spoken out about exactly how he felt about it, like he did when they dropped him from the Test against the West Indies at the Rose Bowl 2020, but this time he’s tried, some minor grumbling apart, to bite his lip. The men picked ahead of him, Ollie Robinson and James Anderson, made a strong case with their wickets, and besides, there were plenty of other good judges making Broad’s point for him in the papers and on TV. It must have left him addressing those same questions all over again, about whether, and why, exactly, he wanted to go on flogging himself for a team who didn’t seem to rate him enough to pick him when they needed him. He said before this Test that he wasn’t going to make a spur-of-the-moment call about retirement. He says he’ll make the decision between now and the spring tour to the West Indies. But first, he had a point to prove. This was the 19th five-for of Broad’s career. The highlights make it look as good as any of them. He got Warner, of course, in the classic fashion, just the two of them must have pictured it, with a delivery from around the wicket that zigged one way and then zagged the other, Steve Smith, too, and Cameron Green, caught behind with similar deliveries, then a vicious bouncer to remove Pat Cummins, and a cutter that had just enough on it to beat Usman Khawaja to finish. That last one was his 125th in Ashes cricket. Among Englishmen, only Ian Botham has more, with 128. But it wasn’t his best bowling, Broad often takes his wickets in fits and sparks, there was none of that this time, just a lot of craft, sweat, and toil. It took him 29 overs – the last time he bowled that many in an innings in which he took five was back in 2009 – and there were moments when Khawaja, Starc, and Nathan Lyon were laying into him, when he looked just as vulnerable as any of his teammates. But he persisted, bowling a line and length that, the data showed, he’d often struggled to find on his previous three tours here. He drew more false shots from batsmen than he has done in the past, too. And he made his point. How bittersweet for the team that it came so late.",Sport/Sport,Broad’s bittersweet blitz proves a point he should not have had to make | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/06/stuart-broad-bittersweet-blitz-proves-a-point-he-should-not-have-had-to-make-ashes-cricket
1/6/2022,"Best gig ever: 3.30 in the morning, sun coming up, watching from the front as you played to an uninterested crowd at Oxford’s Trinity College May ball, 1981. You must have thought you’d sold your soul to the devil. kiwisimmo The fee was good and we needed new amplifiers. I remember lots of “girls” – as they might have called them in an upper-class novel – being sick in the bushes and people tearing around in outfits. They made the mistake of giving us rooms and free champagne. Pete [Thomas], our drummer, was an enthusiastic drinker in those days and took off into the night wearing a gown and a tiara.  Does accepting an OBE show you are not the person who wrote Any King’s Shilling? pipini It’s just another bauble in my china cabinet, along with the MTV Video Music award, which no one knows I’ve got, either. Look, my grandfather Pat McManus was in the Royal Irish Regiment and died from illness resulting from wounds he got fighting for king and country. My dad [Ross McManus] went in through the tradesman’s entrance to sing at the Buckingham Palace staff ball in 1962. So, apart from the fact that my mum told me to go and have a laugh, I thought: “I’m going in through the front door.” It doesn’t change my view of the idea of empire as ludicrous and hideous. One of the gentlemen working there was a fan and he’d written this great setlist on Buckingham Palace notepaper. That’s my nicest memento of it. I loved The Death of Magic Thinking [from his new album, The Boy Named If] on your recent US tour. Does it have anything to do with Joan Didion’s book The Year of Magical Thinking? justalackey The song is about the terror of leaving childhood, when the wonderful inventions of your imagination come up against teenage lust and algebra. The Sopranos writer David Chase gave me the title when I met him at a supper 11 years ago. I told him my boys had started school and he said: “School. The death of magic thinking.” I knew exactly what he meant. I believe This Year’s Model is your best LP. Do you agree? aubraccity Every 35 days I’d agree, and on another day I’d recommend something like North, which a lot of people didn’t like, but came from the heart. The music industry prefers the orthodox to new ideas, but I’ve always tried to do something else, even at the risk of losing some of my audience. Oliver’s Army contains a phrase that seemed shocking then, but now is considered unspeakable. If you rewrote the couplet, what would its replacement be? DaveDumanis I believe I was wide awake when I wrote the song about career opportunities, but sadly that two-word slang is a historical fact. It was a derogatory term for Irish Catholics, which I sang to make the point. One dreads to think how the officer class spoke about people of colour. Perhaps I’d express the same idea differently now. I’ve tried changing that verse, but after 44 years I’m done singing it. I’ll sing (What’s So Funny ’Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding instead. Seeing Taylor Swift release new versions of her albums, are there any of your albums you would like to revisit? TeardropsStart We did This Year’s Model as Spanish Model, with Spanish-speaking singers, but if Taylor Swift wants to record all my albums, I’ll not stop her. What percentage of your audiences is female? FifiCorr It depends on whether I open my eyes. I told Iggy Pop that I’d always imagined the [Hollywood venue] Whisky a Go Go would be full of girls in hipsters doing the pony dance, like in films, but by the time I played there it was people wearing bin liners. He said that in the 1960s it was exactly like I’d imagined, but often the reality – in the words of John Cooper Clarke – is some shaven-headed chap with his long-suffering wife saying: “I’m freezing, Charlie, haven’t they finished yet?” while listening to our set. Any news of the long-mooted new Burt Bacharach/Costello music for a possible Broadway show? Paul_Hocker Burt and I were in Capitol studios in the summer with a 30-piece orchestra, cutting two new songs for a collection looking at our nearly 30-year collaboration. We worked on two musical scores simultaneously about 12 years ago, but sadly Painted from Memory and a proposed Austin Powers musical ran into legal complications. At least we got to work together again. He’s 93 and the intensity of his focus is undimmed. He’ll go: “Elvis, in bar six, you’re not singing the right melody.” Which cover versions of your songs have you enjoyed, apart from Robert Wyatt’s Shipbuilding? NewProfile Robert’s is the original and mine is the cover, because it was written for Robert to sing. My favourite cover is Roy Orbison doing The Comedians live at the Cocoanut Grove [in Los Angeles]. I was the rhythm guitarist in the band and when you met this lovely gentleman you’d never imagine he had that power of voice. Oddly enough, my most covered music is The Juliet Letters. There’s an incredible Polish cabaret version, a piano version, string quartets, all sorts. Have you ever met or wanted to work with Neil Young? quilt The first time I played the Bridge School benefit [Young and his late wife Pegi’s event for speech-impaired children], in 1990, I heard this disembodied voice singing harmony during Alison, and Neil walked out with a hand mic. It was great. He played Slane Castle in Ireland when I lived there and my agent, who is also Neil’s, said I should surprise him and sing on Rockin’ in the Free World. I slunk on stage, Booker T from the MGs was singing backing and he pointed to a piano and said: “Take it, Elvis,” like in a dream. Fiona Apple’s performance of I Want You on YouTube is stunning, disturbing and even upsetting. What more can you tell us? Strawwdog Imagine being stood next to Fiona when she did it. It was at some crazy production in Atlantic City. I’d never assume that anyone from a younger generation would know who we are, but she threw herself into it. As the guitarist, I was just trying to match her intensity. By way of thanks, we put a lot into our version of her song I Know. Do you agree that your Saturday headline on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury in 1987 is the festival’s finest two hours? Bestbeforeoctober88 I could win money in a pub quiz or provoke uncontrollable laughter by suggesting I ever headlined the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury, but it was different then. I’d say ’84 was better. More recently, I was third on the bill to the Rolling Stones and managed to get into the inner sanctum. I was chatting to Keith Richards, Mick Taylor and Ronnie Wood when Charlie Watts, bless him, came up and, without saying hello to me, said: “Hey Woody? Who is this fella, married to Diana Krall? What’s that about?” It was fantastic, because, being a jazzer, he was a huge fan of my wife. How do you feel about the lemonade? wjelly [He laughs.] In the 70s, I was the backing vocalist on an advert my dad did for R White’s Lemonade. Secret Lemonade Drinker saved Christmas when we were broke, and after I had a hit they revived it. I actually preferred Moorhouse’s green cream soda, which was big in Birkenhead. I’ve discovered that Moorhouse’s became R White’s, so it seems I was drinking R White’s long before I knew it. Tramp the Dirt Down and Shipbuilding being obvious exceptions, why have you steered clear of political songwriting? Ummmmm I never sit down and think: “I am now going to write a political song,” but if we’re speaking about things I’ve sensed or seen, then perhaps I can interest you in the following titles from our catalogue of human misery and wickedness and the groovy lessons there: Less Than Zero, Night Rally, Oliver’s Army, Little Palaces, Pills and Soap, Invasion Hit Parade; [This Sad] Burlesque from The Juliet Letters; Bedlam and She’s Pulling Out the Pin from The Delivery Man; The River in Reverse; Red Cotton from the unfinished opera The Secret Songs; Bullets for the New-born King and One Bell Ringing from National Ransom, American Gangster Time; all the songs with the Roots on Wise Up Ghost; Blood & Hot Sauce from the A Face in the Crowd score; We Are All Cowards Now from Hey Clockface; and I guess Nick Lowe’s (What’s So Funny) ’Bout Peace, Love and Understanding. Does that answer the question? What would be your favourite Liverpool FC XI? TheJohnYoung The 1965 FA Cup side, which I can still name. When Roger Hunt died this year, it was really a moment. When people ask who my ultimate hero was, expecting someone from music, the only person I ever thought of in heroic terms was Roger Hunt. I could never play football any good, but Roger looked like a footballer; he never got sent off. He was like a Roy of the Rovers kind of invention and after he stopped playing he went back and worked in his family business. He didn’t haunt the club. Which is the best invention – space travel or gravy? Stuntman Gravy is ghastly. I don’t like it, because I come from another planet. For years, in Little Palaces, I heard: “The sedated homes of England / Who does defend the lies?” instead of: “The sedated homes of England / Are theirs to vandalise.” Any other examples of this? peilefella I like that line and might use it from now on. I once recorded a demo of Bob Dylan’s You’re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go for a George Jones record I was hoping to persuade him to let me produce. I sang it as a country song and in all honesty sang: “Relationships have all been bad / Mine have been like lanes and rambles.” Much later, somebody pointed out that the line was actually: “Verlaine’s and Rimbaud’s”. My guess is that George Jones was not a huge fan of French symbolist poetry. You find yourself on stage at the 2024 Republican National Convention with Donald Trump in the front row.

1/6/2022,"When the naturalist Edward O Wilson was a boy of seven, the dorsal spine of a fish that he was reeling in near his home in Mobile, Alabama, damaged his right eye. He lost the sight of that eye and subsequently suffered partial hearing loss in his teens. These disabilities led Wilson, passionate naturalist from an early age, these disabilities led him to focus on small organisms, particularly ants, that he could study at close range. Observing their tiny worlds led him to a global vision of the importance of biological diversity in the survival of species including our own. Wilson, who has died aged 92, has been called a modern Charles Darwin for his influence as both a close observer and a unifying theorist. He was also a campaigner whose humane and elegant writings were among the first in recent times to argue that we have a moral duty to value other species, not only for their own sake but also for the sake of future human generations.  Fascinated by the apparent selflessness of social insects such as ants and bees, which would sacrifice themselves to protect their colony, in 1975 he published Sociobiology: The New Synthesis. The book sought to provide an evolutionary explanation (based on the work of the Oxford University zoologist William Hamilton) for the existence of apparently altruistic behaviour in a wide range of species. A single chapter addressed altruism in human societies, suggesting that humans evolved to support the reproductive success of their close relatives as a way of ensuring that the altruistic individual’s genes were represented in succeeding generations. Although Wilson argued that human altruism and social structures were also products of culture, his book provoked a resurgence of the “nature v nurture” debate. Soon after its publication, a number of high-profile biologists, psychologists and sociologists from his own university, Harvard, wrote a furious letter to the New York Review of Books, denouncing him for biological determinism and implying that he was providing support for racist and sexist beliefs. Long before the days of the Twitterstorm, opponents whipped up such rage against Wilson that in 1978 protesters dumped a jug of iced water over him as he sat on the platform at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Not in any way deterred, Wilson followed up with On Human Nature (1979), for which he won his first Pulitzer prize. Today most scientists accept, as Wilson argued, that genetically determined “human nature” includes the capacity to develop extremely flexible patterns of social behaviour under the influence of culture. By the time Sociobiology was published Wilson had already developed ideas that would prove even more influential in ecology and conservation. As a young researcher, he had travelled widely in his quest to document some of the millions of species of ants and other invertebrates. Observing and collecting in New Guinea, the South Pacific and the Florida Keys, he began to think about how different species disperse, compete, survive or become extinct in a confined area such as an island. With the ecologist Robert MacArthur he wrote The Theory of Island Biogeography (1967), showing how a balance developed between immigration of new species and the extinction of previous residents based on birth and death rates and the number of individuals the environment could support. They distinguished between animals that produce many young and invest little in their care (r-stragetists) and those that produce fewer young but care for them in early life (K-strategists), depending on the stability of the environment. Today ecologists recognise that there is a continuum between the two life history strategies, but the concept has been highly influential. Wilson’s numerous contributions to his field also include the discovery that insects used complex systems of chemical signals to organise their societies. Just as Darwin developed much of his theory of natural selection from studying finches in the Galapagos archipelago, Wilson’s work had implications far beyond island habitats. As burgeoning human populations encroach on wild spaces, they confine the habitat that remains to smaller and smaller parcels. Wilson’s work showed how this has led to a collapse in biological diversity, with consequences beyond the loss of individual species. In the latter part of his life he became a prominent advocate for the conservation of biodiversity. His book Biophilia (1986) argued that an affinity for other species is fundamental to humanity. In 2016, aged 87, he published Half Earth: Our Planet’s Fight for Life, building on an earlier idea that we should set aside half of the planet’s surface for wildlife. His language was forthright and decidedly un-academic. “We’re extinguishing Earth’s biodiversity as though the species of the natural world are no better than weeds and kitchen vermin,” he wrote. “Have we no shame?” Born in Birmingham, Alabama, he was the only child of Edward Wilson, a former army accountant, and Inez (nee Freeman). His parents divorced when he was seven, briefly placing him as a boarder in the Gulf Coast Military Academy in Gulfport, Mississippi. As he wrote in his autobiography, Naturalist (1994), the strict discipline of the school, and the southern code of behaviour inculcated by his father, left him with a belief that he should “never back down if honour is at stake”; he attributed his later willingness to face up to his academic opponents to this upbringing. He dealt with the unhappiness in his home life by focusing intently on the natural world, deciding at the age of 11 to document every species of ant in his home state. At 13 he made the first report that fire ants, an invasive species, were living near his home in Alabama. While still an undergraduate at the University of Alabama, he published a survey of the fire ant’s progress across the state. He began a PhD at the University of Tennessee before transferring to Harvard, which housed the largest museum collection of ants in the world. He spent the rest of his career there, winning a second Pulitzer prize in 1991 for his monumental volume The Ants (co-authored with a fellow entomologist, Bert Hölldobler). He retired from teaching in 1996 but continued to write and campaign as professor emeritus and honorary curator in entomology. He received numerous honours, including the US national medal of science and the Crafoord prize (often regarded as a Nobel prize for ecologists). The E O Wilson Biodiversity Foundation was set up in his name in 2005 to continue his educational work in conservation. In October 2021 Wilson participated via video link in a discussion with David Attenborough on the Half Earth concept, where he was asked to comment on whether the Covid-19 pandemic would change attitudes to the interconnectedness of species. He replied that in future the pandemic would be regarded as “just a flick on a movie screen”, but, he added “We will never come out from under the loss of species that we have been carelessly allowing to happen just by our ordinary everyday activities. Extinction is for ever.” Wilson married Irene Kelley in 1955 and they settled in Lexington, Massachusetts. She died in August 2021. Wilson is survived by their daughter, Catherine.

1/6/2022,"An increasing number of women are losing their monthly periods because they are following a social media trend for restrictive diets and excessive exercise, experts say. Charity heads and nutritionists have raised the alarm about the increase in hypothalamic amenorrhea, a condition where the body enters survival mode because it is under-fuelled, causing menstruation to stop. It is a reversible disorder caused by stress related to weight loss, excessive exercise and trauma.Martha Williams, a clinical advice coordinator at the leading eating disorder charity Beat, said the condition was becoming more widespread, and was often seen in people who were not underweight and did not have a low body-mass index.  “There are not exact statistics on this issue but the majority of people we see have lost their periods and some of these women are not seriously underweight. Some are a healthy weight but have restrictive eating,” Williams said. Women often consulted their family doctor when their period stopped, but Williams said many GPs did not have the right training to spot the underlying cause, and prescribed the contraceptive pill to restart menstruation. Williams said the pressure of lockdown was difficult for a lot of people, and the message from the government promoting an hour of exercise a day was not helpful for everyone. “The emphasis on this message was likely quite damaging for someone struggling to regulate their exercise levels.” She added that social media could be a “problem”, because women shared edited photos of their bodies, creating unrealistic expectations of how people should look. Williams said fitness influencers would also tell their followers what they ate in a day, including how many calories, which did not help those with eating disorders. Women have been raising awareness on Instagram about the implications of overexercise and so-called clean eating – a restrictive diet concept where a person avoids refined and processed foods. Chloe Hodgkinson helps girls with disordered eating, amenorrhea and periods, based on her own experiences. When she stopped taking the contraceptive pill her period did not return, and doctors said it was normal for menstruation to be delayed. Although Hodgkinson felt it was related to the fact she was undereating, because her body mass index was not low doctors did not take her seriously. She went to a dietician who told her she had low oestrogen, after which she changed the way she approached exercise and eating, and her periods resumed.

Renee McGregor, an eating disorder dietitian, said in the past 12 months she had had 1,000 hours of contact time with clients and 95% of them had had hypothalamic amenorrhea. “It’s a big problem, bigger than people appreciate, particularly because for so long it has been – not that it should be – accepted that when women do lots of exercise they lose their period.” She said the problem was often misdiagnosed, with women being turned away from GP surgeries and told their period had not resumed because their body was getting used to coming off the pill. “I had someone last week who was told by a gynaecologist that because they do not want children right now it’s not a problem. But not menstruating has a wider impact on physical and mental health,” she said.",News/Society,Women losing their periods because of restrictive diets and excessive exercise,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/06/women-losing-their-periods-because-of-restrictive-diets-and-excessive-exercise
1/6/2022,"A computer glitch at the Gatwick control tower left flights unable to land or take off at Britain’s second biggest airport during the morning peak. Three planes were diverted to other London airports as controllers from Air Navigation Services were forced to shut down the malfunctioning IT and guide planes in under a backup system.  Passengers on British Airways flights returning from Antigua in the Caribbean and Tampa in the US found themselves landing 45 miles away at Heathrow at the end of their overnight flights. After a delay of more than two hours, the planes refuelled and continued on to the Sussex airport. An easyJet flight from Belfast was diverted to Luton airport, on the other side of London. The three flights were diverted during the “switch down” of the IT system, which started at 7.25am. Other planes were left circling and delayed until the normal systems were restored at 9.10am. A Gatwick spokesperson said: “Earlier IT issues in the air traffic control tower this morning have been resolved and flights are arriving and departing the airport as normal. Some flights may still experience delays however and passengers are advised to check their flight status with the airline.” A spokesperson for easyJet, the biggest airline operator at Gatwick, said it was “experiencing some disruption to our flying programme as a result” of the IT failure. “While this is out of our control we apologise for the inconvenience caused by the diversion and delays and would like to thank passengers for their patience and cooperation,” they added. The disruption was limited. Only about 300 flights in total were expected to land or take off from Gatwick on Thursday, as services return towards normal levels from the depths of the pandemic. In 2019, Gatwick was the busiest single-runway airport in the world.",News/UK news,Gatwick IT glitch stops flights landing or taking off during peak period,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/06/gatwick-it-glitch-stops-flights-landing-taking-off-london-airport
1/6/2022,"Tracey Emin has said she is launching her own “revolutionary” art school in Margate as part of her broader plan to transform the seaside town into an “artist’s haven”. The school, named TKE Studios – after her full name, Tracey Karima Emin – will be housed at a former bathhouse and mortuary five minutes from her studio. Emin said she wanted to redesign the location into 30 studios for future art students.  “People will have to apply, and there’ll be really strict rules,” she said in an interview with the Times. “No subletting, no smoking, no loud music. And if people don’t want to do the rules then they won’t have a studio there. “The other thing, because the rents are going to be so low, I’m not having people having part-time jobs and then never coming in. So, I’m setting it up so they … will have time to work and paint.” Students will be required to regularly put their work on public view, Emin added, “so there’s like this constant intellectual rigour. People can’t just be passive”. The mortuary will be turned into a “mini museum” filled with her own work. Emin will also launch an accompanying artist’s residency programme at a separate location to encourage artists to permanently move to Margate, where she grew up and returned after the death of her mother. “So it’s organically making the place right for the right people,” she said. “I love art. And I love property. And this way I’m combining both my loves and doing a bit of good.” The artist, who underwent invasive treatment for a cancer diagnosis – including having her bladder and womb removed – said she had a new outlook on life and renewed sense of purpose. “You know in life you sort of amble around, and you don’t know what you’re doing, but you know you’re doing something? And then suddenly you see the light. You go: ‘Oh my God, that’s what I’m doing!’ Well, with Margate now, especially after the cancer and everything, it’s all making sense what I’m doing. I am sort of helping. I am making an artist’s haven.” Emin, who shot to fame in the 1990s with her work, Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963-1995, said last year people had not understood the “seriousness” of her art and wrote her off as a “narcissistic, deranged, screaming banshee”. Her recent exhibitions include a 2018 neon sign in St Pancras station in London that reads “I want my time with you” and last year her paintings, neons and sculpture were exhibited alongside those of Edvard Munch at the Royal Academy.",Arts/Art and design,Tracey Emin to launch ‘revolutionary’ art school in Margate,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/06/tracey-emin-to-launch-revolutionary-art-school-in-margate
1/6/2022,"It was between Christmas and new year that Boris Johnson began to worry about the next crisis. In the preceding weeks, Covid had been the big dividing line with his backbenchers as the prime minister wobbled over further restrictions but was chastened by an angry cabinet and a mass rebellion of his MPs over the light-touch plan B measures. But a cost of living crisis has the potential to be the much more serious matter in 2022, and the prime minister told aides he wanted work to begin on what other mitigations for rising energy prices might be necessary.  Despite this, Johnson may have thought he had a few weeks’ grace with his backbenchers and friendly newspapers for having decided against new Covid restrictions. That hope was undone in the first press conference of the year when the prime minister stumbled over a question from the Sun over energy bills and the potential to cut VAT – a key Labour demand. When he entered the chamber for prime minister’s questions the following day, Johnson appeared to have come prepared for a victory parade in front of his MPs for allowing a normal Christmas and new year despite surging Covid cases. But Angela Rayner, the Labour deputy leader, took him immediately to task on inflation, tax rises and heating bills, and the prime minister made a string of errors in response, denying his own words on inflation and twice radically overstating the warm homes discount, saying it was a rather implausible £140 a week. Time and again his backbenchers howled about the pressures their constituents were facing on fuel, food bills and tax rises. One of his key cabinet loyalists, Jacob Rees-Mogg, had gone rogue in a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, asking for the prime minister to reconsider his plans for a national insurance rise in April, which will come just as a revised price cap is likely to drastically push up energy bills. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is not minded to pursue major interventions. And Johnson’s problem is that many of the options open to him will fall short. Of what has been suggested so far, such as an extension of the warm homes discount or even a VAT cut on bills, nothing is likely to make much of a dent in the eye-watering rises consumers are likely to see. The cost of living crisis has the potential to be immensely damaging politically in a number of ways. Many voters who are not especially vulnerable will now care more about a sky-high energy bill than catching Covid. Labour can draw stark parallels with the start of Johnson’s time in No 10. When voters ask themselves whether they feel better or worse off, for many the answer will be the latter. MPs privately say the opposition has a chance to inflict real damage on this issue, rather than on sleaze scandals or rows over Covid restrictions, both of which can sway disgruntled voters midterm but may not ultimately be what matters in the polling booth. Crucially, the squeeze on voters’ pockets gives MPs opportunity to attack the government over their pet grievances, whether that is net zero, deregulation, tax rises or failure to be sufficiently enthusiastic about Brexit. Each one can be seen as a remedy and attract a caucus of troublemakers. A popular and deft prime minister could find ways to contain and mitigate the pressures, with the support of his backbenchers. But with more difficult decisions on the pandemic and embarrassments over sleaze and rule-breaking likely to come, Johnson’s reputation is sufficiently damaged within his own party to make the task even harder.",News/Politics,Combination of cost of living crisis and Covid spell trouble for Boris Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/06/combination-cost-of-living-crisis-covid-spell-trouble-boris-johnson
1/6/2022,"The Football Association is to proceed with a plan to use VAR at only nine of 32 FA Cup third-round fixtures, believing the benefits of using the technology outweigh inconsistency in the way ties could be decided. Only matches played at Premier League grounds will have video refereeing because the FA Cup is not licensed to use VAR across all its fixtures. This means that West Bromwich Albion’s tie against Brighton on Saturday will not use the technology despite it being installed at the Hawthorns and there will not be uniformity in the refereeing.  The FA Cup has used VAR since 2018, when it became the first competition in England to implement it as part of a trial. The FA has never applied for a full licence to use the technology, however, which must be agreed with the football lawmaking body Ifab. Last season VAR was only used at ties where Premier League clubs were at home up to the quarter-finals, where all matches were then licensed. The FA has not yet taken a decision on whether to license later rounds this season. The FA is aware of questions over a potential imbalance in sporting standards but is reluctant to increase the running costs of the tournament, with clubs not licensed having to install the necessary minimum of four cameras and costs having to be covered to operate them and hire the necessary officials. “Video assistant referees provide match officials with additional support and should be utilised wherever possible,” the FA said. “However, only Premier League stadiums are currently licensed to use VAR due to the infrastructure, workforce and costs that are required.” The Premier League introduced VAR permanently at the start of the 2019-20 season. The EFL opted against doing the same owing to cost, but five Championship clubs have the technology after seasons in the top flight. Reports have suggested some Championship clubs want the league to adopt “VAR light”, a scaled-down system approved for trials by Ifab.",Sport/Football,FA defends use of VAR at only nine of 32 third-round Cup ties,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/06/fa-cup-defends-var-nine-of-32-third-round-ties
