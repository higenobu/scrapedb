3/20/2022,"During a pro-war rally in Moscow on Friday night, Russian President Vladimir Putin invoked the words of Jesus Christ in order to justify his invasion of Ukraine. Moscow police said more than 200,000 people attended the rally, Al Jazeera reported. Polling shows that a majority of Russians support the war in Ukraine, which has already left numerous Ukrainian civilians displaced, injured, and dead. Speaking to the crowd in a turtleneck and down winter coat, Putin said he ordered the invasion ""to get people out of their misery, out of this genocide, that is the main reason, the motive and purpose of the military operation that we began in Donbas and Ukraine,"" according to The Washington Post. Russia has repeatedly accused the Ukrainian government of committing genocide in separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine. ""And this is where the words from the Scriptures come to my mind: 'There is no greater love than if someone gives his soul for his friends,'"" Putin continued, paraphrasing John 15:13. Both the Post and ABC News translate the Russian word душу (dushu) as ""soul,"" but most English translations of the passage use ""life."" The verse is part of a long discourse Jesus delivered to his disciples as they traveled to the Garden of Gethsemane, where he was arrested and taken to be crucified after ordering Simon Peter not to use force to defend him. Putin identifies as a Russian Orthodox Christian but has expressed discomfort with speaking publicly about his faith.

3/20/2022,"President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke for nearly two hours on Friday to discuss Russia's unprompted invasoin of Ukraine, CNBC reports. The strategic conversation ""was seen as a critical test of whether Biden can convince China to stay on the sidelines of the conflict in Ukraine, and to turn down Russian requests for military or economic aid,"" CNBC writes. Here's what we know about the conversation so far. The White House has not yet issued a formal readout of the call, but did note the conversation began after 9 a.m. and lasted just under two hours — ""an unusually long time for a presidential call with the leader of a U.S. adversary,"" CNBC notes. According to a summary of the conversation from the Chinese, however, Xi reportedly told Biden that both the U.S. and China had an obligation to promote peace between Russia and Ukraine. ""The world is neither peaceful nor tranquil,"" the Chinese leader is said to have told Biden, per CNBC, and ""the Ukraine crisis is not something we want to see."" Xi also reportedly told the president that, as economic behemoths, both the U.S. and China ""must not only lead the development of China-US relations on the right track, but also shoulder our due international responsibilities and make efforts for world peace and tranquility,"" per the Chinese summary of the call. Beijing has thus far refused to explicitly condemn Russia's actions against Ukraine, but is still calling for a diplomatic solution to the crisis, Reuters writes. The Biden administration previously warned China not to aid Russia in the war.
