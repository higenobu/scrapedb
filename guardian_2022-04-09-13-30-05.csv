4/9/2022,"At the time of the worm moon, when earthworms rise through topsoil, leaving casts as evidence, I remembered a field that Owen John Owen – shepherd, neighbour and frequent outdoor companion during the years I lived in Cwm Pennant – once showed me, years ago, under this same last full moon of winter. I thought to revisit, as I have done on many subsequent occasions, and re-experience its magic. We’d come out of the Cross Foxes in Garn – the local farmers’ pub – after one of the lock-ins that were frequent in those days. As dawn approached, the moon rose, silvering the craggy profiles of the hills. “I want to show you something!” Owen John said. We drove to where field walls descended and fanned out towards in-bye land of Nantcyll. Views widened. We glimpsed both coasts of the Llŷn peninsula. We took a path that rose gently towards Mynydd Graig Goch, slipped through a gate and sat in a moon-shadowed corner of the mountain wall, the slope beneath illuminated. The winter-grey grass at this altitude hadn’t the sheen of new growth then. The same is true today. Looking down across the pasture, drystone field-dyke at my back, ancient hut circles clearly visible nearby, the ground now, as then, seems to seethe with wild movement. I focus my glass. The field is alive with hares. The grey tint of their winter coats has not yet moulted to give way to rich russets of summer. It coordinates perfectly with a spectral hue in the grass. The activity in the field captivates. I count 60 hares. There were surely more. The chasing, leaping and bounding, the mutual pursuits, are breathtaking. So is their fearlessness. Two race past within feet of me, so close I can hear their breath, feel the thump of mighty hind legs. Farther into the field, a group of does nibble grass unconcernedly, awaiting their moment. Beyond them, jack hares squat on their haunches or stand bolt upright in a perfect circle, elders of the hare tribe, peaceful, calmly debating territory where soon all will be mayhem.

4/9/2022,"Rural Denmark will come to a standstill on Sunday when for the first time in three years its inhabitants will be able to stand in a field in large numbers to watch the moment when Denmark’s 200,000 organic cows are let out of their barns for “summer” to graze on grass – an event so exciting that the creatures run, leap, buck and “dance” with joy. Økodag, or dancing cow day, as it is affectionately known, marks the start of the outdoor season for all organic cows in Denmark. Children scramble up hay bales to get a better view and parents hold camera phones poised to capture the magic at midday precisely when the cows are released nationwide. The first Økodag was held in 2005 with 10,000 visitors. Since then, 1.2m people have joined the annual ritual. “Thanks to Covid, we’ve been digital for the last two years, with only a live stream for people to watch, so everyone’s looking forward to getting close to the cows again,” said Louise Køster, the chair of Organic Denmark. “The cows are so happy to be outdoors, to feel the sun and the wind, that they dance,” she said. “Out in the field, a cow can also go for her favourite dishes – grass, clover, various herbs etc.” A certified organic animal must be outside eating grass for at least six hours a day between April and November in Denmark, occasionally a challenge with the unpredictable Danish weather. Farmers had to bring the cows in until the ground was frost-free in 2013 and it was so cold in 2014 that the herd ran straight back to the barn after their Økodag release. The forecast this year is a more cow-friendly 7C, but day-trippers are still advised to wrap up warm for the 42 events across the country. As well as dancing cows, visitors can take a tractor ride, tour a milking parlour or marvel at the automatic brush mechanisms set up to give cows a back scratch. All before being sent home with a party bag of organic potatoes, at least if the last in-person Økodag in 2019 is a guide. “It’s just the best day,” said Køster. “People get really into it and farmers explain how milk goes from farm to table, so that if you drink dairy, you do so mindfully.” There’s also an attempt to rehabilitate the image of the cow. “We talk about their role in the ecosystem, how they contribute to biodiversity, how we need fewer fields dedicated to feeding animals and more producing food for people,” said Køster. “We’re looking at ways to keep cows grass-fed all year round, to dry and bale summer grass to last the winter and give cows the nutrients and proteins they need.” Denmark was the first country in the world to introduce a state-controlled organic label in 1990. The country has the highest organic market share in the world with 12.8% of food bought in supermarkets and every third carton of milk purchased certified organic. But there’s still work to be done, said Køster. “Something like Økodag is a great opportunity to highlight how it takes both producer and consumer to make changes.”",News/World news,Danes revel in ‘dancing cow day’ for first time since Covid outbreak,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/danes-revel-in-dancing-cow-day-for-first-time-since-covid-outbreak
