1/16/2022,"An oft-arrested homeless man silently shoved an unsuspecting stranger to her death beneath a Times Square subway train Saturday morning, then quickly confessed to the heinous attack, authorities said. The innocent straphanger was randomly targeted around 9:30 a.m. by Simon Martial, 61, as the woman waited for the R train in the Times Square-42nd St. station, a high-ranking police source said. There was no indication that the pair spoke or had any interaction before the deadly attack, and the 40-year-old Asian woman was pronounced dead at the scene, cops said. “I pushed a woman in front of a train,” the deranged suspect told police after surrendering without incident, according to a second source. The suspect has a documented history of mental health issues with the NYPD, the second police source added, and there was no indication that the killing was a hate crime. “A New Yorker was going about her business, right in the heart of our city and right in the heart of our subway system in Times Square, when she lost her life,” said MTA Acting Chair and CEO Janno Lieber. “This is unconscionable, this is unacceptable, it has to stop.” During the suspect’s nine minutes inside the station, he also targeted a second female straphanger on the platform — with the woman escaping her assailant only to witness the fatal shove of the second rider seconds later, said NYPD Assistant Chief Jason Wilcox. “He approaches her, he gets in her space,” said Wilcox. “She gets ... very alarmed. She tries to move away from him and he gets close to her. And she feels he was about to physically push her onto the train.” Mayor Adams appeared at the Times Square scene shortly after Martial boarded another train and fled downtown before surrendering and admitting to his crime at Transit District 2 in the Canal St. station, said a law enforcement source. The suspect, with 10 arrests since 1998, was briefly imprisoned after a 2018 robbery of a gypsy cab in Greenwich Village and then placed on parole that expired last year. Rider Roxanne John, 46, said she knew something terrible happened when she entered the station and spotted the large police presence. “It could’ve been me, it could’ve been anyone, I feel frightened,” she said. “The only time I feel safe on the train is when I see the cops ... I feel scared now.” At the scene, the mayor stressed the need to provide New Yorkers with the right mental health services before sending his condolences to the victim’s relatives. “Our hearts go out to the families,” said Adams. “To lose a New Yorker in this fashion will only continue to elevate the fears of individuals not using our subway system.” But other Manhattan straphangers remained stunned and terrified as word of the latest subway system attack spread. “Oh my goodness, it’s so scary,” said Ruby Meng, 30, a regular subway rider. “I’m so afraid of this. I just try to pay attention to my surroundings.” “Wow, just wow,” said subway rider Brandon Lewis, 41, who takes the train every Saturday to a farmers’ market. “I’m very disheartened about this. This city is starting to disassemble itself.” Transport Workers Union Local 100 Vice President Canella Gomez said the shaken subway operator was taken to Bellevue Hospital for treatment after the fatality. “No train operator comes to work expecting to have a passenger thrown in front of his or her train,” she said. “This is the part of the job that no one is ever truly physically, mentally or emotionally prepared for.” She also called for the new administration at City Hall to come up with a plan to handle the homeless situation in the city’s mass transit system.",U.S./NY Daily News,"Homeless man shoves stranger to her death in Times Square subway station, then confesses: NYPD sources",https://news.yahoo.com/woman-fatally-shoved-front-train-153300273.html

1/16/2022,"DENVER (AP) — Near the starting point of a Colorado wildfire that destroyed over 1,000 homes and buildings, one man stayed home in an apparent attempt to save a voluminous collection of papers documenting his family's history plus his personal writings and records of his community activism. Robert Sharpe, 69, was spotted last month trying to fight the fire and waved off at least one warning for him to evacuate his home in a semi-rural area near Boulder, according to his brother Milt Sharpe. His remains were found inside his home a week after the Dec. 30 fire tore through the area. The search was still on Friday for the only other person still listed as missing in the fire — at a site where a home burned on the outskirts of the town of Superior, downwind from the fire's origin point and across open fields and hiking trails at the edge of suburbia. “We are still actively working on the searching for and identifying the remains of the second missing person,” Boulder County Sheriff's spokesperson Carrie Haverfield said. Authorities have not named the woman, but relatives identified her as 91-year-old Nadine Turnbull while declining further comment to The Associated Press. She lived with her adult granddaughter on plot of land that harkened back to the area's rural roots, with two dogs, two goats and two horses, said Amy Smith, a family friend. Smith organized an online fundraiser for Turnbull's granddaughter, Layla Cornell, who escaped the fire and is struggling to start over again. Neighbor Scotty Roberts told KCNC-TV last week that he barely escaped his family’s home in the fire and went to Turnbull’s house to tell her to get out, asking a sheriff’s deputy to come with him. However, as soon as the front door to the home opened and let air inside, the fire went “woosh” and intensified, he said. Cornell escaped, but Turnbull was tethered to her dogs, and the leashes were wrapped around a table, the station reported. “I couldn’t pull all of them and the table with me at the same time,” said Roberts, who described the fire as being “everywhere” at that point. He said he was sorry and ran, said Roberts, who shook with emotion during the interview. Haverfield, the Boulder County Sheriff’s spokesperson, declined to answer questions about whether any first responders went to the home and whether anyone attempted to evacuate Turnbull, citing the ongoing investigation. Robert Sharpe's home lies about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from Turnbull's house, and Milt Sharpe said one official told him that his brother was fighting the fire at his home and was warned to leave. Another official said he told a man to leave who refused and that he believed it was Robert Sharpe, Milt Sharpe said. Robert Sharpe was not foolhardy and loved his life, so much so that it was hard to keep up with all of his interests and views, from conservation to children's rights to salsa dancing, Milt Sharpe said. His older brother was someone who would have been willing to suffer some injuries in a fire to save what was important to him, including the documents and papers stored in dozens of file cabinets, Milt Sharpe said. Milt Sharpe added he believed his brother would have fled if he had realized an “unsurvivable wall of fire” was headed his way. Robert Sharpe worked in construction for many years and was handy with helping fix things and also offering articulate opinions on just about anything, calling into the community radio station and attending town meetings, his brother said. Throughout his 30 years at radio station KGNU, former station manager and news director Sam Fuqua told The Denver Post that he recalled Sharpe calling to talk about environmental issues, politics and local development. “He’s the kind of caller you want to have call in to your shows,” he said. “Someone who’s listening, thoughtful and connecting dots that nobody else in the conversation is connecting.” Milt Sharpe is also mourning the loss of another brother who died while sequestered in a hospital room with COVID-19 two weeks before the fire. He said he is ashamed that he may have been callous to Robert Sharpe's efforts to help him understand the way he saw the world. “It was massive, it was just a huge, large life he lived, and he did it with love and compassion,"" Milt Sharpe said. _____ Associated Press researchers Jennifer Farrar and Randy Herschaft contributed to this report.",U.S./Associated Press,"Woman, 91, still missing 2 weeks after massive Colorado fire",https://news.yahoo.com/woman-91-still-missing-2-224917855.html
