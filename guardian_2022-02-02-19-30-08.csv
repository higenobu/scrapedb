2/2/2022,"Every year in the Canadian town of Wiarton, devout followers of Wiarton Willie the albino groundhog learn from the rodent if the grip of winter is loosening. The annual celebration is part of Groundhog Day, a North American tradition (and movie of the same name) which holds that if a groundhog sees its shadow after emerging from hibernation, six weeks more of winter weather are expected.  But the world of rodent-based meteorology has been shaken by revelations that Willie, a celebrity so beloved that he has statues built in his honor, died last year – and his demise was covered up by town officials. In a break from tradition, Willie did not appear during Wiarton’s 2021 groundhog festival, which was streamed online because of the coronavirus pandemic. As questions swirled over the missing animal, the town put out a news release, poking fun at his disappearance. “Is Willie dead or alive? Would you question the Easter Bunny or Santa Claus?” the town wrote. “This event is not about Willie (the groundhog) and truthfully it never has been.” Months later, however, officials admitted to the Canadian press that the beloved rodent had died of a tooth abscess and that the news had been withheld from the public. (Festive woodchuck fatalities aren’t unique to Canada: in 2014, the then New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, dropped Staten Island Chuck during a Groundhog Day celebration. Chuck later died of internal injuries.) But the recent saga of Willie has exposed years of scrambling and deception by city officials in the event of untimely rodent deaths. Wiarton traces its annual festival back to the 1950s, when the early seasonal predictions were provided by a trio of groundhogs. In the 1980s, the first “Willie” appeared on the scene. He lived to 22 and was found dead only two days before Groundhog Day in 1999. A funeral was held, shocking a crowd of children, who had not known Wille was dead. But the body in the wood casket was an imposter – a previously stuffed groundhog was used instead. “The smell [of the dead groundhog] was something you wouldn’t have wanted to be near,” Sam Brouwer, Willie’s caretaker from 1987 to 2002, told the Canadian press in 1999. “It would have been a closed-casket funeral.” Four years later, two understudy animals, dubbed “Wee Willies”, were found dead. CBC reported at the time that Willie himself was implicated in the deaths. His caretaker Francesca Dobbyn did not immediately inform the town, fearing the news would generate bad press. Despite calls for her termination, Dobbyn kept her job. In the event of a Willie dying, the town often has to scramble to find a replacement because of the distinct appearance of the white rodents. “With [famous groundhogs like] Punxsutawney Phil and Shubenacadie Sam, I wouldn’t be surprised if they had a different groundhog every year – people don’t really notice the difference,” Wiarton’s mayor, Janice Jackson, told the Canadaland podcast in a recent interview. “But for albinos, because they are rare, and some of them are true albinos with red eyes and others have brown eyes, there is a slight difference between them.” When Willie died in November, the town realized all groundhogs were hibernating and a new white one couldn’t be swapped. Officials improvised, having the mayor toss her hat in the air and make the prediction instead of revealing his death. “I didn’t want our community to be stunned on the day,” said Jackson. Wiarton’s 2022 Groundhog Day festival will once again be a virtual event. This time, a brown groundhog will be used.",News/World news,Groundhog Day: mysterious rodent deaths and cover-ups plague ceremony,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/groundhog-day-2022-canada-celebration
2/2/2022,"François Truffaut’s Jules et Jim from 1962 is the love triangle that feels like it’s happening in the swinging 60s present moment, like Godard’s triple-header Bande à Part. Actually, it’s set before and after the first world war, and the three principals finally reunite by bumping into each other at a Paris cinema showing a newsreel about the Nazis’ book-burning. (It’s based on a novel by Henri-Pierre Roché, who wrote another love-triangle story, Les Deux Anglaises et le Continent, which Truffaut filmed as Two English Girls in 1971.) Appropriately for this film’s internationalist ethos, neither male hero has a homeland-appropriate name. Oskar Werner is Jules, a diffident young Austrian living in 1912 Paris: scholar, translator and Francophile. He befriends the rather more worldly Frenchman Jim, the journalist and would-be author played by Henri Serre. They are instantly as thick as thieves, a couple of jaunty swells and elegant flâneurs, devoted to art and avowedly uninterested in money – though each, apparently, has some modest private income. They drink in cafes, discuss poetry, box together at the gym and in a rather desultory way pursue women, including the madcap Thérèse (played by Truffaut stalwart Marie Dubois) who has a party trick of puffing a cigarette from the wrong end like a steam train.  Thérèse, too, turns out to be a journalist, revealing that she has sold a memoir of her amorous adventures to the Sunday Times magazine in Europe – presumably referring to the New York Times, though maybe it’s an anachronistic nod to the British Sunday Times magazine, that had just launched in the same year as the film. Whichever is meant, it’s a startling newspaper appearance in French cinema, to go with the New York Herald Tribune in Breathless and the Daily Telegraph in Monsieur Hulot’s Holiday. Both men fall for the same bohemian, beautiful force of nature, Catherine (played by Jeanne Moreau) having persuaded themselves that she resembles a beautiful Greek statue that they have seen; like a sculpture, Catherine is revealed to them without a past. She entrances them both with her beauty and wild freedom, and Jim instantly starts writing a roman à clef about the intensity of their three-way romance. When war breaks out, Jules and Jim must fight on opposite sides. So is Jules et Jim a secret queer love story? Or is their friendship an antiwar fable, Catherine symbolising what they vitally have in common? She is arguably a fatuous male creation, the original manic pixie dream girl, whose function is to showcase the men’s more substantial nobility. Yet perhaps her passion and restless unhappiness point up the essential flimsiness and mediocrity of these men. At any rate, Jim is on the winning side in the war and has the more flourishing career (although his novel doesn’t find a publisher) and there is something very literary about the film, with dialogue line-readings that often sound like the voiceover narration by Michel Subor. The dangerous quality of Catherine is obvious from the outset. She flings herself in the Seine on a whim while the trio are on a nighttime stroll, just to make them rescue her. And before they go on an impulsive trip to the coast, she empties out a bottle of sulphuric acid she had been meaning to take along in her suitcase (“for the eyes of men who tell lies”). It is a truly strange moment; the writing is on the wall. Moreau’s most remarkable scene comes when she insouciantly sings in front of Jules and Jim a song of her own composition, accompanied on the guitar by another of her lovers: Le Tourbillon de la Vie, or The Whirl of Life. (“She had eyes, eyes like opal / That fascinated me … The oval of her pale face / Of a femme fatale who was fatal to me.”) Moreau sings with a delicate, birdlike, non-fatale chirrup. And perhaps the film’s meaning resides in that idea of a fatal whirlwind. Before the war, Catherine asks Jim to meet her in a cafe at seven, and doesn’t show up. Later, she explains something about a hairdresser, and reveals she is marrying Jules. If she had made it to their date, and Jim had the courage to get his proposal in first, would things have been different? Happier? Or even more unhappy? Do love and destiny hinge on something as random as a missed date? Catherine is missing from the title but she dominates the movie.  Jules et Jim is released on 4 February in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Jules et Jim review – Truffaut’s love triangle is a whirlwind masterpiece,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/02/jules-et-jim-review-truffauts-love-triangle-is-a-whirlwind-masterpiece
2/2/2022,"Shielders are feeling abandoned. In the nearly two years since they were first told to cut themselves off from the world, people whose health conditions made them particularly vulnerable to Covid have seen official support fragment and then lapse, mask wearing become politicised, and lockdowns that have come and gone. But they have remained indoors and afraid, acutely aware of how the same society that renders them vulnerable – with the familiar indignity of rushed visits from carers or, now, demands to return to the office – doesn’t seem to care whether they survive. For many, the headlong rush back to “normal” means the end of the few freedoms they had been able to enjoy. A trip to a shop enabled by everyone wearing masks and prescribed social distancing becomes too much of a risk when those measures disappear. Shielders are forced to make unenviable decisions about risk, balancing their physical safety with the need for connection. Many have found solace in the online disability community, but fear that this will represent their only socialising for months, if not years, to come.  Shielders do not want a return to lockdown, even if in some ways it was when they felt most supported. As three of them tell us below, they simply want mask wearing and some social distancing to remain, so they can venture out without being scared. I never thought that being unable to get out much would mean I was ready for a global crisis. But when lockdown struck, I was ready. Since I collapsed at the top of the stairs one day in 1999, ME – and later a reliance on additional oxygen for my severe asthma – had limited my ability to get out and about to a few trips a month. When Covid appeared, that changed to a few trips a year. I already knew how to keep myself occupied and cheerful during long periods of isolation. When people were panicking at the start of lockdown, I wanted to say: “Welcome to my life – this is how it’s been for me for years!” If anything, I have been able to socialise more. I now have regular scheduled Zoom calls that provide a link to the outside world, and friends FaceTime now when they didn’t really before. But I can count on my fingers the number of times I’ve left the house in the past two years: three times for my vaccines, a couple for hospital appointments, and a few times to sit in my sister’s garden to have a socially distanced cup of tea. Before we were jabbed, she would stand outside the window and call me, so we could see each other while we chatted. With vaccines offering a little bit of reassurance, she comes inside now, wearing a mask and socially distanced. We still can’t hug. My last trip where I went inside somewhere other than a doctor’s office was the first Saturday in 2020; I’d seen reports of the virus in China and other places and thought there was a chance it could be here. And it turns out it was – the first recorded UK cases were in York, where I live. My doctor has told me not to go inside anywhere, so I can no longer go to the embroidery groups that were once my social life. A friend sends me emails about each meet-up, but it’s not the same. I worry that as people move on with their lives, they’ll forget I still want to be included. The worst part has been the unending fear. Some friends think I’m overly cautious, but my doctor told me that, with my lungs, Covid would almost certainly kill me. I don’t want to die. So every time I do see someone, even though they’re tested and wearing masks, I spend the next week anxious and scared. I can’t see how I will ever be able to stop shielding. I’m 60 now, and I’ve just accepted that this is how life is going to be. I’d been enjoying a small reprieve – and some social contact – at the beginning of last summer. People were wearing masks and socially distancing; people seemed to be aware of the virus. Even before Christmas, I was taking the calculated risk of seeing very small groups of people in spacious places. But now masks are gone and people aren’t being careful, so I’ve been forced back inside. I don’t think I’ll be going anywhere now until the weather improves in the spring and we can do things outside. The official lockdown was easier, because there was so much online. Some things are still online – I’ve been doing virtual cheese tastings! – which makes them much more accessible, but lots of things have gone back to in-person. I’m lucky that a lot of my friends are also shielding, so there’s that camaraderie, and I’ve made new friends on social media. But there’s still people who try to persuade me to go to the pub. They don’t understand that we’re still scared. This winter feels hard; the weather is horrible and I’ve run out of box sets. If I didn’t have my partner, I think I’d have gone round the bend. I am terrified of catching Covid – in the past 10 years, I’ve been hospitalised twice just from catching a cold – and I don’t know how to deal with that fear. So I just ignore it. I’m naturally inclined to put a positive spin on things, but there just isn’t anything positive to say. I’m taking one day at a time. I find it really hard to understand how someone can be so selfish as to not wear a mask or get the jab. I’m the first person to argue for bodily autonomy – disabled people are so often denied it – but this is a public health crisis. Your decision not to wear a mask puts others at risk, not just you. The rising misinformation makes me really angry. People care much more about their own ability to go to the pub and get drunk than my ability to just step outside my front door. With people so desperate to pretend the pandemic is over, I’m worried that if we’re not careful, we’re going to get to a situation where disabled people like me are pushed aside and left stuck inside. The more society opens up, the more my world shrinks. When people were wearing masks, socially distancing, and reducing their contacts, I could take the calculated risk of going swimming to help manage my chronic pain. Now, with Omicron being allowed to rage through the population, I’ve been advised not to do even that. Seeing as I want to stay alive to see my niece grow up, I’m having to sacrifice my long-term health because some don’t want to wear a mask. I’ve been lucky that I’ve been able to keep working. But because I run an arts collective for disabled people, the weight of keeping all my staff safe has been heavy. Add to that the need to keep myself and my large care team safe, and there’s hundreds of extra impossible decisions to make each week. I’ve had to have really difficult conversations with my PAs about what risks they’re taking outside work. They’ve been really understanding but I hate it. Disabled people have been left to keep ourselves alive, without realistic advice, and it’s exhausting. Shouldering that responsibility is really lonely. The original shielding advice told vulnerable people to isolate – it gave no thought to the fact we have carers or families or jobs. We can’t just hide away for ever. When the pandemic started, I thought people writing this advice didn’t understand our lives; now, two years in, I know it’s that they don’t think our lives are valuable. That’s really hard to process, but I’m here to argue because I know how valuable we are. One of the big myths of the pandemic has been that there is nothing that can be done to help disabled people, because we’re inherently vulnerable. But that’s not true. My medical condition is a tiny part of what makes me vulnerable – problems with care, for example, are a much bigger problem, as are people who simply don’t care. If Covid protections were kept in place, I’d be safer. In the past few months, I’ve felt increasingly left behind by the government and everybody else. And that’s horrible. There is one thing that gives me hope: seeing more and more disabled people raise their voices in solidarity with each other. Covid itself has been a mass disabling event – think of all the people with long Covid – so I think our community will only get stronger. I believe that in the future, we’ll be so much harder to ignore. That’s what keeps me going right now, when there’s so much to make me angry.",News/World news,‘I don’t want to die’: the shielders who fear the end of Covid restrictions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/i-dont-want-to-die-the-shielders-who-fear-the-end-of-covid-restrictions
2/2/2022,"More than 100 far-right candidates are running for political office across the country as Republicans this year according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a non-profit that monitors hate groups. Aside from those expressing extremist rhetoric and far-right views, the ADL has found at least a dozen of the candidates had explicit connections to ‘“white supremacists, anti-government extremists and members of the far-right Proud Boys”. It includes primary challengers running to the right of some sitting Republicans.  In Arkansas’s third district Neil Kumar, who the ADL found has written for white supremacist publications, is challenging the incumbent congressman, Steve Womack, who broke with Republicans in voting in favor of creating the January 6 commission to investigate the Capitol attack. The openly racist views of Kumar prompted the Arkansas state Republican party to take the unusual step of declaring him a “non-recommended candidate” in the upcoming primary. The wave of far-right candidates includes sitting legislators like the Arizona state senator Wendy Rogers, who has admitted to being a member of the Oath Keepers, a far-right militia with 11 members currently under federal indictment for seditious conspiracy. Other militia groups have candidates running or already in local office. The Washington Three Percent militia claims members in dozens of elected offices throughout the Pacific north-west, the Washington Post found, “including a mayor, a county commissioner and at least five school board seats”. In Idaho the far-right anti-government activist Ammon Bundy – who led an armed standoff against federal agents at Malheur wildlife refuge in 2014 – is running for the governor’s office. Bundy’s group, the People’s Rights network, has now increased its national membership to 33,000 members and has at least 398 activists in 39 states, according to a report by Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights. Many far-right candidates have no direct links to violent extremist groups, but do support a range of far-right views. The ADL tracked at least 45 candidates running for office this year that have “lent credence in some way” to the QAnon conspiracy theory movement. Many more hold on to Donald Trump’s “big lie” – the false belief that the 2020 election was stolen. Nationwide there are 207 current elected officials who aided former president Trump in efforts to overturn the 2020, according to data compiled by the Insurrection Index, a project of the voting rights group Public Wise. The index includes senators like Ron Johnson from Wisconsin, who voted against certifying the 2020 election and spread misinformation including suggesting that the January 6 attack was carried out by “fake Trump voters”. While many candidates are seeking local or national legislative seats, some are purposely running for bureaucratic offices whose chief responsibility is to certify elections. Thirty are standing in contests for attorney general, according to tracking by the States United Democracy Center, a non-partisan group that monitors election races nationwide. Fringe political candidates are a part of every US election cycle, but while these 2022 candidates hold far-right views they are also part of a wave within the Republican party that is no longer fringe but increasingly represents a powerful – even dominant – wing in the party. “The real danger is not just the wave of extreme candidates, it’s their embrace, their mainstreaming by the Republican party,” said Steven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard University and the co-author of How Democracies Die. “The United States has always had nutty, extremist, authoritarian politicians around the fringe. What is new and really dangerous for democracy is that they’re increasingly running as Republican candidates.” Levitsky added: “At first you had a flirtation and tolerance with a handful of extremists at the fringes. We’re now seeing an army of extremists embraced by the former president. They’re marching in and taking over the Republican party at the state and local level.” In Oregon, Daniel Tooze, a prominent associate of the Proud Boys who has participated in street brawls with anti-fascists in Portland, is running for Oregon’s state legislature in the 40th district. Tooze ran for the same seat in 2020, failing to secure the Republican nomination in the primary, but he received 40% of the Republican vote in the primary. This year Tooze is the only Republican who has filed to run again. “When mainstream parties take onboard figures who deny the legitimacy of elections, refuse to accept electoral defeat, condone or even engage in political violence, you are putting democracy at risk,” said Levitsky. Tooze declined to be interviewed for this article but stated in correspondence: “I’m just a regular guy.” A review of Tooze’s campaign website and filing statement show no mention of affiliation with the Proud Boys. Tooze campaign messaging uses the language of mainstream Republican talking points. The Guardian has previously reported on far-right groups shifting their focus to local communities. Since the Capitol attack members of groups such as the Proud Boys have shown up to local venues including school board meetings to stand alongside mainstream conservatives, especially around issues such as Covid-19 restrictions. This month Tooze tweeted a video of Thomas Renz, a far-right anti-vaccine influencer, speaking at a panel convened by Senator Johnson that promoted misleading information about Covid-19 and vaccines. The video of Renz went viral in alt-tech platforms but also within mainstream social media. Tooze wrote of the video: “It’s time to hold the government accountable for what they’ve done to the people.”",News/World news,Republicans to field more than 100 far-right candidates this year,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/republicans-100-far-right-candidates-2022
2/2/2022,"The beer-soaked samba session was drawing to a close and, as usual, the crowd was preparing to vent its spleen. As percussionists from one of Rio’s top samba groups hammered their tamborins and tantãs, revelers raised their glasses and let out loud, cathartic cheers demanding the removal of a president they despise. “Fora Bolsonaro!” jeered the sweat-drenched throng. “Bolsonaro out!”  The explosion of dancefloor dissent was nothing new to Renascença Clube, a storied association in north Rio that has been a potent symbol of black pride and resistance since it was founded by black Brazilians in 1951. In recent years – as public anger at Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has intensified – Renascença’s weekly Samba do Trabalhador (Worker’s Samba) hootenanny has hosted metronomic displays of anti-government rage. Yet last week’s protest prompted an unusual and incendiary reaction from the club’s management that has scandalized the world of samba and exposed the rancorous political fissure that has opened up in Brazilian society during Bolsonaro’s three years in power. The morning after the 24 January show, a statement signed by Renascença’s president, Alexandre Luiz Xavier Alves, appeared on its social media accounts, declaring that club statutes forbade “any kind of party-political demonstration”. The pronouncement appalled progressive sambistas and fans – with many attributing it to pressure from Bolsonarista board members trying to silence criticism of their embattled leader. “He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it,” one infuriated music lover wrote on the club’s Facebook page, quoting Martin Luther King Jr. Many saw the club’s perceived fealty to Bolsonaro – who has a long track record of hostility towards Afro-Brazilian and Indigenous people and culture – as a betrayal of its 70-year history as a cauldron of black resistance. “Here’s a club that was created to embrace people who were excluded from society – a club that was born to fight an oppressor – taking the side of the oppressor. It just makes no sense,” said Gabriel Cavalcante, a cavaquinho player and singer who is one of the Samba do Trabalhador’s nine members. The musicians hit back at the club’s communique, declaring themselves “tireless enthusiasts of freedom of speech”. “I felt furious – we all did,” said Cavalcante, describing how samba had emerged in early 20th-century Rio as a profoundly politicized form of expression for marginalized black Brazilians who had only recently escaped slavery. “There’s no such thing as samba without politics – samba is politics.” Cavalcante quoted a lyric from Candeia, a legendary 20th-century sambista, to explain the genre’s role as an outlet for protest and pain: “Samba is sorrow, it is suffering, it’s the flight of my woes.” The outcry forced Renascença’s directors to backpedal. They deleted their controversial statement and issued a second, insisting the “politically neutral” club was not responsible for political protests from artists or audiences. The president, Alves, claimed the first statement had been mistakenly published after pressure from conservative members who accused him of “complicity” with the attacks on Bolsonaro. Alves said club rules meant he could not say whether he supported Bolsonaro or his leftist rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who looks poised to win this year’s election. However, he insisted Renascença was open to politicians of all stripes and opposed censorship. If concertgoers wanted to pillory the president at the next week’s show, that was their democratic right: “We’ll be there to hear the voice of the people.” Four days later, on Monday afternoon, security had been stepped up as the people poured on to the club’s rectangular patio to send a defiant message to Bolsonaro and the board. Their outfits suggested little affection for Brazil’s rightwing leader. One spectator wore a T-shirt carrying the initials of Mexico’s Zapatista Army of National Liberation; another a cap honouring Brazil’s Landless Workers Movement. A third sported a red jersey with the slogan “Make Brazil 2002 again” – a reference to the year of Lula’s historic first election. Band members also joined the demo, donning T-shirts featuring kaleidoscopic Lula portraits and the phrase: “They’ll never stop the arrival of spring.” As his group warmed up, Moacyr Luz, the celebrated sambista who leads the Samba do Trabalhador, said he wanted rid of a president who had wrecked Brazil’s international reputation and clobbered Black culture. “Brazil can’t take this any more,” Luz complained over a late-afternoon Aperol spritz. “Bolsonaro is humiliating Brazil.” Two hours later, after the band played a succession of politically charged sambas, the first cries of “Fora Bolsonaro!” erupted, followed by screams of support for Lula: “Olê, Olê, Olê, Olá, Lula, Lulaaaa!” A huddle of Bolsonarista counterprotesters tried to retaliate, bellowing anti-Lula insults, but were quickly drowned out. Night fell, cups emptied, bodies swirled and a white Fora Bolsonaro flag was unfurled before the show reached its climax: an emotionally charged rendition of Apesar De Você (In Spite of You) – a dictatorship-era anthem that foresees an explosion of public joy after the collapse of the military regime. “In spite of you, tomorrow will be another day,” the audience chanted as several disgruntled Bolsonaristas glared at the floor. More than 50 years after that song was written, Luz voiced optimism that Brazil was approaching a moment of similar euphoria. “We must not retreat,” the sambista said. “All this discomfort is because they know their days are numbered.”",News/World news,‘Samba is politics’: struggle for Brazil’s future invades its dancefloors,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/samba-club-struggle-brazils-future
2/2/2022,"No one knew why Patrick Foster wasn’t performing better – he should, by rights, have been the star player for his club. Foster had been signed by Northamptonshire in his teens, developing through their academy and second XI. As a student at Durham University, he was mentored by Graeme Fowler and by his early 20s he had played against and alongside the likes of Virat Kohli, Josh Lalor and Dawid Malan. Even now, his teammates at Oxford’s Horspath CC would still see the occasional flash of the former professional’s undeniable talent; the problem was, he didn’t seem to be trying. The 27-year-old Foster batted recklessly, like someone working off their anger issues, or trying to get out as quickly as possible. Bowling – his specialism – seemed a chore, and he was unengaged in the field, preferring to stay out on the boundary. There didn’t seem much team spirit about him either. The young man spent most of the lunch and tea breaks on his phone, and his commitment was increasingly flaky. For someone who had once been desperate to play cricket for a living, he always seemed to have a reason why he couldn’t make the next fixture.  When Foster left the club in 2016 it was under a cloud. “I’d taken advantage of their support,” says Foster. “My relationship with the game had become quite a sad one.” He had borrowed considerable sums of money from both the club and a couple of individuals involved at it, wrongly assuming that each would never find out about the other. Worse, he’d stopped making any repayments. The truth was, he owed a lot of other people too. Foster’s gambling addiction began at 19, the first time he ever laid a bet. In a new book, co-authored with cricket journalist Will Macpherson, he describes how his student mates dragged him into a betting shop, and while he was waiting for them to put on their complicated football accumulators, he took a turn at online roulette on a fixed-odds betting terminal. He won £72 on his first spin, and from that moment he was hooked. When his mates left, he slipped back into the bookies and stayed for the next five hours. Professional sportspeople are three times more likely than the average person to develop a gambling addiction. “As somebody who has a competitive personality, in an industry where gambling is normalised, you are more vulnerable,” says Foster. “You have huge amounts of free time and you often have more money than your peers. But the dangers are underestimated because in sport it’s almost seen as the ‘healthy’ vice. Drugs are tested for, drinking has a huge impact on your performance. Gambling’s something you can do as a pressure release, and a way of combatting boredom, that isn’t going to the pub.” There is no doubting, when you read Foster’s book, that it was his obsession with gambling that ruined his chances of first-team career at Northants – or that his environment contributed to the issue. “The nature of cricket as a sport really lends itself to the problem,” says Foster. “You have sustained periods of time off the field, you can’t play when it rains, and the default in cricket changing rooms is to get the cards out and play poker or put horse racing on the TV.” In 2013, four years after his first-class retirement, New Zealand batter Craig Spearman spoke publicly about the devastating effect that gambling had on him during his career. Two years ago, Hampshire’s Chris Wood became the first cricketer to open up about his addiction while still playing, and the help he sought has enabled him to continue his career. “There are without doubt quite a few in cricket who need help,” says Foster, who works with the Professional Cricketers’ Association to raise awareness of the issue, and is currently employed by Epic Risk Management, a consultancy that works to minimise gambling harm. “There are people we know of who need support, and a significant number on top of that who are treading a very fine line.” In October 2020, the Sporting Chance clinic founded by the former England and Arsenal captain Tony Adams announced that gambling addiction was now accounting for almost half of their referrals. When Foster started out on his career, he didn’t even know that it was possible to become addicted to gambling. “I knew full well about substance addiction but not about behavioural addiction,” says Foster, whose role focuses on educating young people, be they at schools or sports clubs. Not only is gambling what he calls an “invisible addiction” – in that it can take hold of someone without appearing to change their life on the surface – but it still carries a stigma which makes it hard for those in its grip to seek help. Foster’s gambling habit had lasted for 12 years when he hit his own rock bottom and could no longer hide the monstrous scale of his debts, or the chaos of his daily life. He was often making hundreds, sometimes thousands, of bets a day across dozens of online accounts; treated as a “VIP customer” by the bookmaking firms, he was showered with hospitality and free bets. But he was wagering far more than he could afford, and owed enormous sums to everyone from loan companies to work colleagues. As a private school teacher and cricket coach, he had even exploited his relationships with his pupils’ parents to fund his addiction. While his story is a shocking one, it’s not at all unique. Is it possible that sports bodies have kept their head in the sand about problem gambling because of the huge amounts of funding they receive from betting companies? “The one thing I would say is that things are improving, in that the issue is being noted and acknowledged,” says Foster. “But it needs to be taken a lot more seriously, because it’s only going to increase. “And where there hasn’t been improvement is around the advertising and sponsorship side. I understand that there are a lot of people who can gamble and not have a problem with it, just like a lot of people can drink without being alcoholics. But the volume, the saturation of advertising and sponsorship and exposure of betting in sport has gone past the point of any kind of balance.” The regulation and education around gambling in cricket has previously focused on anticorruption: when Wood made his own addiction known, he received a suspended ban from the England and Wales Cricket Board for betting on cricket matches. Yet – as Wood himself has since pointed out – those who watch and play sport are subject to an overwhelming barrage of messaging and frankly irresponsible promotions that encourage them to gamble. At Epic, Foster, now 34, tries to engage with all those who have a stake in this issue, including those working in the gambling industry. He wants to see the government, regulators, sports bodies and bookmakers take collective responsibility. “The gambling industry cannot take advantage of vulnerable people as they have previously because they do know what’s happening and there’s more they could and should do,” he says. “But until someone tells them they have to, they can do what they want – that’s where the regulators and the lawmakers have to do more. “The only way it’s going to work is if people get together and work collaboratively. That’s the only successful solution rather than everyone trying to defend their own position and blame each other. And that’s not happening at the moment.” As for his own cricketing narrative – it’s going pretty well, thanks for asking. After five years in recovery, which included setting up a financial plan to pay back every one of his creditors over the next decade and a half, Foster is once again taking the field for Horspath. “I wanted to pay them back through a positive impact on and off the pitch,” he says. “Plus I’m still a competitive being – I still need that fix. But now I play for the right reasons again, and with a smile on my face.” Might Bite: The Secret Life of a Gambling Addict by Patrick Foster (Bloomsbury, £14.99) is published on Thursday and available to buy now  This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

2/2/2022,"Phasing out animal agriculture over the next 15 years would have the same effect as a 68% reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, a new study suggests. The paper was co-authored by Patrick Brown, founder and CEO of the fake meat company Impossible Foods. Brown has previously said he wants to eliminate the need for foods from animals.  The EU has been told to bring in better conditions for the transport of live animals, including limits on temperature, by MEPs. However, MEPs ignored calls from campaigners to ban live exports to third countries outside the EU altogether. Analysis published by the Guardian has suggested the EU could be responsible for up to 80% of the global trade in live farm animals – a total of 1.8 billion in 2019. As many as 3.4 million hens may have died in Argentina after a spell of hot weather and temperatures as high as 45C (114F). Reports suggested there were farms that had up to 40% mortality due to heatstroke. As global temperatures rise, farmers across the world are being forced to adapt, experimenting with new breeds and cooling methods. Claims by a Spanish government minister that factory farming is damaging the environment and leading to the export of poor-quality meat have provoked a backlash from industry. “What isn’t at all sustainable is these so-called mega farms … They pollute the soil, they pollute the water and then they export this poor-quality meat from these ill-treated animals,” Alberto Garzón had said. A government spokesperson said the livestock industry was “an absolute priority”. Americans throw out about a quarter of the meat, poultry and fish they buy which, it has been reported, equates to about a billion chickens, more than 100 million other land animals (mostly turkeys, pigs, and cows) and 25 billion fish and 15 billion shellfish (mostly shrimp) that end up wasted and slaughtered unnecessarily.China’s pork production jumped by almost a third in 2021, according to reports. Some analysts estimated at least 40% of China’s 360 million pig population could have been lost due to an outbreak of the deadly pig disease African Swine Fever (ASF), which started in 2018. The disease caused major disruption to the global pork industry as China pivoted to imports to plug a shortfall of its most popular meat.In Russia, a vaccine against ASF is getting closer to being ready, according to officials who want it to start being used in 2024. The country has reportedly been forced to cull almost 1 million pigs following outbreaks of the deadly pig disease and has said a vaccine could be used to stop the spread of the disease in wild boar.Charges against a US-based animal rights activist who conducted an undercover exposé of conditions at the pork company Iowa Select Farms have been suddenly dismissed. Reporter Marina Bolotnikova investigated why. Separately, prosecutors are reported to be keeping gruesome evidence of animals in distress from juries in trials involving animal rights activists. The Dutch government has unveiled a €25bn (£21bn) plan – the first of its kind in the world – to radically reduce the number of livestock in the country as it struggles to contain an overload of animal manure. “We can’t be the tiny country that feeds the world if we shit ourselves,” said Tjeerd de Groot, an MP from the Democrats 66 party, which is part of the coalition government in the Netherlands. As the UK battles a biodiversity crisis, with about one in six native species threatened with extinction, rewilding and carbon trading are being touted as solutions. But Welsh farmers have spoken out about their fears of being sidelined and how they hope for the chance to pursue more nature-friendly farming routes.New restrictions on administering drugs to healthy animals have come into force across the EU. Campaigners have criticised the failure of the British government to pass equivalent rules to tackle antibiotic use in farming in the UK. Meanwhile, US sales of farm antibiotics classified as “medically important” fell by 3% between 2019 and 2020, according to US officials. Sales remain slightly up on 2017.Should animals have the same rights as humans? Writer Philip Ball has explored the debate around recognising animals as sentient beings. Experiments have shown, he writes, that farmed pigs respond as if “depressed” when kept in barren conditions devoid of mental stimulation.Finally, in rural Pakistan women have always reared animals but been excluded from selling them. Zofeen Ebrahim reports from one market in Sindh province that has been putting women at the centre of trade. “For the first time I felt free, I could make the decision of buying and selling myself,” said goat farmer Rozina Ghulam Mustafa. Thank you to everyone who continues to get in touch to share their thoughts on the series. Reader Jacqueline Savill has written to warn of the failure to tackle the threat of antibiotic resistance. I’m a retired pharmacist. In the 1960s a House of Lords committee warned that the routine use of antibiotics in animal husbandry would cause resistance. By 1980, the first bug resistant to all antibiotics was found in the US.

2/2/2022,"Wisconsin residents cheered when Oshkosh Defense, a Wisconsin-based manufacturer, won a large contract to build a new generation of post office delivery vehicles - up to 165,000 – but now Wisconsinites are fuming about the company’s decision to produce those vehicles in South Carolina, rather than Wisconsin.  Wisconsin’s political leaders and labor unions are stepping up pressure on Oshkosh Defense as well as the US Postal Service and White House to get the company to do that manufacturing to Wisconsin. The 10-year contract, which could exceed $10bn, is expected to create more than 1,000 jobs. These leaders warn that unless the production is done in Wisconsin, Democratic candidates will be hurt in that pivotal swing state in this November’s elections as well as in 2024. “We are extremely disappointed in Oshkosh Defense’s decision to accept the money from the US Postal Service and then turn around and send their production to a different state,” said Stephanie Bloomingdale, president of the Wisconsin State AFL-CIO union federation. “This is just another slap in the face to Wisconsin workers. People are very outraged about it. It doesn’t fit into president Biden’s vision to have high-road manufacturing.” Many Oshkosh Defense workers are wearing buttons to work, saying, “We Can Build This.” These workers, members of the United Auto Workers (UAW), say they’re dismayed that the company – unionized since 1938 – plans to do postal vehicle production in one of the nation’s most anti-union states. UAW Local 578 in Oshkosh has collected over 1,500 signatures urging the company to rescind its South Carolina decision, and Wisconsin’s unions are planning a big rally in February to further pressure Oshkosh Defense. “When we were notified the company won the contract, we were all excited – that’s another contract under our belt, more work for us to do,” said Thomas Brown, a welder at Oshkosh Defense. “But when we were told it wasn’t being built here, we were all asking, why not? We know we can build it. We got the workers. We got the tooling. It can be done here.” When the Postal Service first awarded the contract last February, it described the effort as a “historic investment” in next generation delivery vehicles that will replace many postal vehicles that are 20, even 30 years old. The new vehicles will be designed to carry more cargo and will have 360-degree cameras, air conditioning and a front and rear collision avoidance system. The Postal Service noted that Oshkosh Defense was “evaluating which of their several US manufacturing locations” it would choose to produce the vehicles, and since all its existing plants were in Wisconsin, some people said there was a bait-and-switch when the company chose South Carolina. In a statement, Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat of Wisconsin, said: “Oshkosh Defense has a history of manufacturing trucks for government service in Wisconsin with skilled union labor, so I remain deeply concerned that they decided to manufacture the postal trucks in what appears to be a newly acquired facility with inexperienced, likely non-union hires, in South Carolina.” Baldwin said she would continue urging Oshkosh Defense and the Postal Service to do further scrutiny of the production site in South Carolina. “I want these trucks made in Wisconsin,” she said. On Tuesday, the UAW’s president, Ray Curry, issued a statement saying that production of the new postal vehicle “is an opportunity for the Biden administration to make real investments in both a cleaner future and good union jobs, but the contract, as it currently stands, fails on both accounts.” Curry urged the administration to have the Environmental Protection Agency review the postal service’s contract because the union asserts the project will have “adverse environmental” and socioeconomic impacts that it says the postal service failed to examine in its Environmental Impact Statement. The post office says its impact statement was done in full accordance with federal environmental law after having reviewed all comments submitted. When Oshkosh Defense announced plans to produce the vehicles in South Carolina, it chose to use a large, empty, former Rite Aid warehouse in Spartanburg. The company said it was eager to have a “turnkey” plant where it could quickly begin production to help meet its goal of delivering the first vehicles in 2023. At the time, John Bryant, president of Oshkosh Defense, said Spartanburg “has a skilled workforce and a proven history in advanced automotive manufacturing”. BMW has its only US assembly plant there. Bryant said: “We evaluated sites in multiple states, including Wisconsin, for production of the [Next Generation Delivery Vehicle]. The Spartanburg, South Carolina, facility ranked highest in meeting the requirements of the NGDV program and gives us the best ability to meet the needs of the USPS.” Bryant noted that the company plans to establish a postal vehicle technical center in Oshkosh that will employ more than 100 people. When the Postal Service was asked about Wisconsin leaders’ demand to move production to Wisconsin, it said: “We remain committed to modernizing our delivery fleet in service to our customers.” It added: “The NGDVs will be manufactured in the United States, which is consistent with the terms of the Postal Service’s contract with Oshkosh Defense.” In October, the White House announced that in one of the administration’s first, big green projects, the infrastructure package would give the Postal Service $6bn so that 70% of its new delivery fleet would work on battery-electric power. But Cindy Estrada, a UAW vice-president, said: “We’re saying Build Back Better, but you’re getting it wrong right out of the gate. These are public dollars where we could have more control over making sure this goes to good, union jobs. “This is not good for the Democrats. Working people are hearing one thing about Building Back Better and seeing the results the other way,” Estrada added. “This is an opportunity. A mistake was made. This is not Build Back Batter. This is building back worse.” Biden administration officials say they have no ability to alter the Oshkosh Defense contract, noting that it was awarded by the Postal Service, an independent agency that the White House doesn’t control. They say their hands are, in essence, tied. Asked about the Oshkosh Defense controversy, a White House official responded, “As the President has said, this is the most pro-union administration in history. President Biden is focused on creating good union jobs across the country and believes firmly that every worker in every state must have a free and fair choice to join a union.” In November, AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler and 30 union presidents wrote to President Biden saying the Oshkosh Defense contract “missed an opportunity” to “ensure high-road, union manufacturing”. They concluded by asking him to “support our call” to have the Postal Service make sure the contract “supports and protects Oshkosh Defense’s existing, union workforce. In this way, the administration can join us in opposing Oshkosh’s use of a USPS contract to facilitate union evasion and a race to the bottom in wages, benefits and working conditions”.",News/US news,‘Building back worse’: Wisconsin’s fight over the production of USPS vehicles,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/02/wisconsin-usps-delivery-vehicles-oshkosh-defense
2/2/2022,"Millions of trees are being planted beside Scotland’s remotest rivers and streams to protect wild salmon from the worst effects of climate heating. Fisheries scientists have found rivers and burns in the Highlands and uplands are already too warm in summer for wild Atlantic salmon as they head upstream to spawn, increasing the threat to the species’ survival.  Fisheries on the River Dee in Aberdeenshire, one of the country’s most famous salmon fishing rivers, have planted 250,000 saplings along key tributaries. They plan to plant a million in the Dee’s catchment by 2035, including native rowan, aspen, Scots pine, birch, willow, hawthorn and juniper. In 2018, the year Scotland recorded the lowest rod catch for salmon since records began, climatic changes meant water temperatures in 70% of salmon rivers were too warm for at least one day that summer. They exceeded 23C, a temperature that induces stress and behavioural change. A coldwater species, Atlantic salmon prefer summer temperatures above 10C; at 33C, they cannot survive. Marine Scotland scientists found that only 35% of Scotland’s rivers, which stretch for 64,000 miles (103,000km), have adequate tree cover. Lorraine Hawkins, the river director for the Dee District Salmon Fishery Board, a statutory body, said: “These rivers and burns are the nursery grounds for young fish and it’s the young fish which will be affected by summer temperatures – their feeding and growth rates are affected. If it gets hotter, we will see fish dying.” Fishery boards across Scotland have similar tree-planting programmes, to provide essential shade to lower water temperatures. Many will be fenced off to prevent the saplings from being eaten by deer. Hawkins said these projects improved the overall health and biodiversity of rivers across the uplands, increasing insect life, leaf fall, managing essential nutrients and flood control. Alan Wells, the director of Fisheries Management Scotland, an industry body, said climate forecasts were clear that water temperatures would continue to climb, even if governments succeed in limiting climate heating to close to 1.5C. “We’ve seen situations where the temperatures in our rivers are approaching critical levels for our salmon, temperatures that they can’t tolerate,” he said. “This will get worse. We need to grow trees now to create that cooling shade.” The dramatic decline in wild salmon numbers is blamed on numerous factors: climate change affecting food availability; weirs and other obstructions in rivers; predation by soaring seal populations; sea lice attracted by fish farms; bycatch by trawlers at sea and poor river quality. Wells said that while Scottish ministers were proposing new conservation strategies, he remained frustrated with the slow pace of change. The Dee marked the start of its angling season on Tuesday by inviting two female anglers who won a fundraising competition last year to make the first cast, an annual ceremony at Banchory. Women are increasingly taking up the sport, Hawkins said, eroding the sport’s traditional domination by men in solitary pursuit of a catch. Camryn Stewart, 14, one of the first cast fishers, said she had been brought up fishing by her parents, Deirdre and Jim. The sport is targeting women and children as it strives to expand its participation and appeal. Stewart fishes with three other girls of her age and said she did not feel like a revolutionary. “I have been surrounded by people who fish, and I’ve wanted to fish all my life,” she said. “We need more people fishing, not just women and children. We gain so much from it. Just being outside and being in the wild. Even if you don’t catch anything, you come back from the day fulfilled.”",News/Environment,Scotland hopes to save wild salmon by planting millions of trees next to rivers,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/02/scotland-save-wild-salmon-planting-millions-trees-rivers
2/2/2022,"Eleven people at the Winter Olympics are in hospital with Covid, Beijing 2022 officials have revealed, although none are in a life-threatening condition. Organisers have also downplayed concerns that the virus is spreading within the ‘closed-looped’ system in Beijing, which completely separates Olympic personnel from the general public, despite a further nine athletes and 23 team officials testing positive in the last 24 hours.  The overall number of cases now stands at 232 since 23 January, leading to fears that some top athletes will miss out when the Games officially begin on Friday. However, Dr Brian McCloskey, chair of the medical expert panel for Beijing 2022, struck an upbeat note in front of the world’s media. “The vast majority of people who have tested positive are well, a lot of them are asymptomatic,” said McCloskey. “There have been 11 people hospitalised, because they had a symptom but none of those are seriously ill in any way.” Everyone traveling to Beijing, including athletes, coaches, team personnel and the media had to test negative twice before traveling, then again upon arrival at the airport. They also have to have daily PCR tests. McCloskey also said there was no signs of a spread within the closed loop, adding: “It’s early days to look at all the gene sequencing, but at present that’s not a problem we’re particularly worried about.” “If we found evidence there was sustained community transmission, then we will activate our response plan, which then means more testing, tracing, isolating and a more aggressive approach to contact tracing. “But we are nowhere near that level at present. But it is not about the numbers, it’s about the extent to which there might be spread within the closed loop.” On Wednesday Sweden and Norway both confirmed they had two new cases each. So far none of Team GB’s 109 athletes, coaches and team officials here in Beijing have caught the virus. The biggest name to test positive so far has been the American bobsledder Elana Meyers Taylor, who has won medals in the past three Olympics. On Tuesday she confirmed she was in an isolation hotel in Beijing but said: “I feel great, I feel like I could go out and train. That’s the most frustrating thing.”",Sport/Sport,Organisers downplay fears as 11 at Winter Olympics in hospital with Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/02/organisers-downplay-fears-with-11-at-winter-olympics-in-hospital-with-covid
