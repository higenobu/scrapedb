5/12/2022,"After Kevin De Bruyne rolled in his and Manchester City’s fourth goal, Pep Guardiola jumped into the arms of his assistant, Rodolfo Borrell. By then Guardiola had already ditched the mammoth black puffer coat, and the gloves have long been off in their pursuit of retaining their Premier League crown. De Bruyne’s peerless performance helped restore City’s three-point advantage over Liverpool at the top and there are now only two hurdles between them and a fourth league title in five seasons. Raheem Sterling added a fifth goal with seven minutes to play but it was De Bruyne, who borrowed Erling Braut Haaland’s meditating celebration as he completed a 17-minute first-half hat-trick, fuelled this spectacular and unerring rout of Wolves. In retrospect, given the mood he started in here, flashing a brilliant ball across the box that was a split-second from picking out Phil Foden with barely a minute on the clock, perhaps it should not have been a surprise that De Bruyne chalked up his first Manchester City hat-trick inside 24 minutes, the third quickest from the start of a game in Premier League history. Every outfield City player joined him to celebrate each goal, the third of which was a beauty. It stemmed from a City throw-in. Joao Cancelo located Raheem Sterling, who was challenged by Rayan Ait-Nouri, and when the ball spilled free De Bruyne gleefully took over the baton, taking a few purposeful strides and carefully nudging the ball into a shooting position before rattling a curling shot into the bottom corner with what is supposed to be his weaker left foot. Then came the celebration, surely a nod to City’s new superstar. Welcome to Manchester. De Bruyne got things up and running at the end of a typically calculated City attack. Bernardo Silva, who operated as a false 9, flanked by Foden and Sterling, slipped De Bruyne through and he stroked a low finish into the far corner. Guardiola clenched both fists. It was the perfect start but Wolves replied four minutes later when Leander Dendoncker capped a fine counterattack. Raul Jimenez powered forward from halfway before spreading the ball wide. City’s makeshift back line did not cover themselves in glory. The 37-year-old Fernandinho, who partnered Aymeric Laporte at centre-back, could not prevent Jimenez from finding Pedro Neto and he centred for Dendoncker to coolly finish. It would have made pleasing viewing for Bruno Lage, who, together with his brother and assistant, Luis Nascimento, and Tony Roberts, the goalkeeping coach, was watching on a couple of miles away at Wolves’ training base, as the trio continue to test positive for Covid-19. Guardiola retreated to the away dugout and glugged some water. He did not need to fret. City regained the lead when the purring De Bruyne leathered in from close range, after the Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa presented him with the ball on a plate after failing to deal with his clever pass through for Sterling. Oleksandr Zinchenko sent a teasing cross into the box from the left that forced Willy Boly into a smart clearance but City continued to probe, Wolves struggling to break their endless chain, and De Bruyne completed his hat-trick without breaking sweat. The thing about De Bruyne is he makes it all look so easy, merely par for the course. With 10 minutes of the first half to go, the game as good as over, he went haring after the ball, on a one-man mission ready to prey in case of a Wolves slip in defence. There was the odd scare – Zinchenko and Fernandinho were thankful for the referee, Martin Atkinson, siding with them after tussles in the box in each half, while Laporte raced back to pilfer the ball as Jimenez surged through towards Ederson – but this was an otherwise pristine performance from City, all in white. The only potentially sour note was Laporte departing on the hour following a collision with Jimenez. Sterling thought he had added the fourth two minutes into the second half but strayed offside before racing clear and applying a composed finish. Inevitably, it was he who would source City’s fourth, and, again, he was involved in the buildup. Foden’s cross forced a panicked clearance by Ait-Nouri and De Bruyne was on hand to slot in. Ederson made a fingertip save to deny Jimenez, moments after Foden rattled a post as City went for the jugular. Sterling somehow failed to finish after reading Foden’s low cross and instead crashed into a post as he attempted to sweep in a fifth. Sterling tapped in a fifth after good work from Cancelo and smacked the woodwork on 88 minutes. For City, there is simply no let-up in this race.",Sport/Football,De Bruyne hits four as Manchester City thrash Wolves to keep cushion at top,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/11/wolves-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report
5/12/2022,"Good morning. US senators have blocked a bid to enshrine abortion rights into federal law, Australian writers are urging voters to prioritise climate action, a Coalition minister is accused of using a youth charity endorsement without permission and Ukraine initiates war crimes trials. Anthony Albanese has been declared the winner of the final leaders’ debate of the election campaign. The Labor leader and Scott Morrison put forward competing views on wage rises, economic management and energy policy in a tightly managed discussion last night. Writers have banded together to urge voters to prioritise climate concerns. More than 60 authors, led by award-winning novelist Kate Grenville, have not backed any parties or candidates, but have asked voters to scrutinise the climate credentials of those running. Meanwhile, the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, has been asked by the Police Citizens Youth Club to stop using election flyers carrying an endorsement used without the permission of the charity or the local president. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned that patience for talks with Russia “disappears” with “each new Bucha, each new Mariupol”. Fighting in Ukraine’s east appears to be settling towards a deadly stalemate.

Woodside’s $12bn LNG development could spell disaster for hundreds of thousands of ancient petroglyphs, traditional owners in Australia’s remote north-west have warned. Many of the carvings are believed to date from 50,000 years ago. Regional Australians have scoffed at government claims of “record levels of Medicare bulk billing”, with data suggesting real rates could be about 20% lower than that claimed by the prime minister, and significantly lower outside major capitals. The Australian Electoral Commission has earned the ire of residents of the flood-ravaged NSW town of Lismore after locals discovered that only one prepolling site, with accessibility issues, is open for voting.

Lufthansa has apologised for denying a large group of Orthodox Jewish passengers from flying after several passengers reportedly refused to wear masks. It’s been one of the Liberal party’s safest seats for more than 120 years. But the Melbourne suburb of Goldstein could be another victim of “teal turbulence” as small-l liberal voters abandon the party of Scott Morrison in favour of yet another high-profile independent, Benita Kolovos writes. If you want living standards to rise, wages should rise faster than inflation. It’s an almost axiomatically commonsense position, Greg Jericho argues, except when Anthony Albanese calls for it – earning the anger of business groups and the tabloid media.

5/12/2022,"This was a result that pretty much suited both parties in the end. Another point towards Everton’s attempt to avoid relegation for the first time in more than 70 years was not quite what Frank Lampard would have wished for before the game but, at this stage of the season, he will take anything they can get. With home fixtures to come against Brentford and Crystal Palace and now a two-point cushion over Leeds, Everton’s destiny remains very much in their own hands. As for Watford, just ending a run of 11 successive home defeats in the league as Roy Hodgson finally picked up his first point here was enough to satisfy their long-suffering supporters. Lampard had insisted before this game that the stakes in Everton’s relegation battle are bigger for him than any of his Premier League titles with Chelsea as his side sought revenge for a 5-2 beating at Goodison Park back in October. Their task certainly appeared to be more straightforward thanks to Hodgson’s decision to make seven changes from the side that started against Crystal Palace on Saturday, with Ismaïla Sarr, Joshua King and Emmanuel Dennis not even on a substitutes’ bench that contained three teenagers. With the 74-year-old’s departure already confirmed, Watford are already making plans for life in the Championship next season having confirmed the appointment of Rob Edwards – 35 years Hodgson’s junior – as their next manager amid complaints from Forest Green Rovers that negotiations had been held behind their backs. The former Wales international will certainly have a major task on his hands after a haphazard campaign that will not be remembered fondly by any Watford supporters – especially given that run of home defeats that stretched back to November. As well as Watford’s team selection, hearing the familiar Z-Cars anthem that greeted the sides before kick-off must have helped Everton feel right at home. Even the referee, Mike Dean, was afforded a small cheer as he took charge of one of his last matches before retiring after 22 seasons in the Premier League. Denied the services of Yerry Mina, Lampard recalled Michael Keane at the heart of his five-man defence and it was the England defender who almost gifted Watford an early lead after he miscued a clearance after Jordan Pickford had given possession away. A wayward punch from Pickford that found its way to the unmarked Ken Sema could also have been punished by a more clinical side. Yet while the travelling supporters were in full voice behind Everton, their team was struggling to pose a threat. Promising opportunities for Demarai Gray, Richarlison and Alex Iwobi all came to nothing, while a volley from Anthony Gordon that sailed into the stands summed up their issues in attack. After a turgid first half, the most likely source of a goal seemed to be Watford’s João Pedro, who – like Richarlison – joined Watford from Fluminense but has yet to make quite the same impact. Pickford was off his line quickly to beat the lively Brazilian forward to a long through ball a few minutes after the restart. Richarlison then called Ben Foster into serious action for the first time when his goalbound shot deflected off Christian Kabasele. A loose pass from Samuel Kalu then presented Gray with a golden opportunity but he could not hit the target after swiftly exchanging passes with Iwobi. Keane did manage to direct his header towards goal from a corner, only for Foster to gather comfortably. Lampard then had reason to look relieved when only a last-ditch tackle from Séamus Coleman prevented a Watford breakaway. Lampard threw on Dominic Calvert-Lewin in a bid to find the breakthrough, while Hodgson responded by withdrawing Kalu for defender Craig Cathcart – a move that had the desired effect. The closest Everton came to snatching the points was a Vitalii Mykolenko shot that was easily parried by Foster to the delight of the home fans behind the goal, who celebrated loudly at the final whistle.",Sport/Football,Everton edge a point closer to safety after Watford end losing home run,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/11/watford-everton-premier-league-match-report
5/12/2022,"As Tony Ralston crossed for Giorgios Giakoumakis to open the scoring at Tannadice, Celtic’s party was in full swing. The Hoops, needing just a point to secure the Scottish Premiership title, had Dundee United at arm’s length. United’s response, via a glorious Dylan Levitt moment, created brief moments of panic in the Celtic ranks. But ultimately only that. Ange Postecoglou has made great play of the fact there are various ways to cross a finish line. Celtic’s approach was to tiptoe, this draw sufficient to leave Rangers an insurmountable challenge. Celtic could have won, they should have won, but none of their followers will care. Postecoglou, who was in warm embrace with his staff at full time, has overturned a 25-point deficit as existed at the end of last season. That Postecoglou’s men did not smash the tape to pieces is understandable. The Australian’s team is a new one, pieced together at a time when the club was in apparent crisis. Many of Celtic’s players had not encountered intensity anywhere near that as exists in Glasgow before this season. Having claimed the ultimate domestic prize, there is cause to think Celtic under Postecoglou will only improve. The first half at Tannadice involved shadow boxing and little else. Reo Hatate fired well over the bar following Celtic’s finest piece of play, where the Japanese midfielder combined for a one two with Giakoumakis. The latter’s cross, six minutes before the interval, narrowly evaded James Forrest. United, despite having the carrot of European football ahead of them, were dismally passive during those opening 45 minutes. Grim, too, was much of the verse from Celtic’s significant travelling support. In 2022, with an exciting football team to support and a title within grasp, concerted pro-IRA chanting bellowed out. Neither Celtic as a club nor Scottish football’s authorities do nearly enough to discourage this kind of behaviour. Hence, naturally, it continues. Rangers were easing to victory against Ross County at Ibrox but there was never any prevailing sense of Celtic being in trouble. Ralston stood up a cross, United’s Liam Smith leapt and missed with a clearing header attempt. Giakoumakis nodded through the hands of Benjamin Siegrist. A brief United rally followed. Rory MacLeod, a 16-year-old forward, cracked Joe Hart’s left-hand post with a low shot. Tony Watt headed against the Celtic woodwork. Charlie Mulgrew was afforded a decent set-piece opportunity from 20 yards out but curled into the awaiting hands of the former England goalkeeper. Back came Celtic. Siegrist delivered a terrific one -handed save from Jota. Giakoumakis shot inches wide. But just when Celtic looked sure to double their lead, Levitt endorsed his blossoming reputation. The on-loan Manchester United midfielder curled beyond Hart from 25 yards, having collected a Mulgrew lay-off. Levitt’s graceful touch has been a recurring theme in United’s campaign. Jota lashed into the side-netting as Celtic chased a victory that would add gloss to their status as champions. Daizen Maeda, following a glorious first touch, lashed into the stand as stoppage time ticked down. It mattered not; for the 10th time in 11 seasons, Celtic are the champions.",Sport/Football,Celtic crowned Scottish Premiership champions after draw at Dundee United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/11/celtic-crowned-scottish-premiership-champions-after-draw-at-dundee-united
5/12/2022,"Sonos, the wireless home-audio specialist, is launching a lower-cost model of its popular TV soundbars alongside its own new voice control system for its smart speakers after its public bust-up with Google. The new Ray soundbar is a more compact version of Sonos’s popular Arc and Beam models, designed to fit neatly in TV stands without affecting sound quality. It connects to a TV through an optical cable, has wifi for streaming music and can be controlled with the Sonos app or a TV remote. The Ray will cost £279 in the UK or $279 in the US from 7 June, sitting below the £449 Beam as the firm’s most affordable model. It has two tweeters and two midwoofer speakers, along with the company’s Trueplay smart tuning system, promising balanced sound with solid bass and crisp dialogue. Separate speech enhancement and night sound modes aim to keep things clear without disturbing neighbours with high volume. The Ray can be linked to other Sonos speakers and the subwoofer to create a surround-sound setup and grouped with speakers in other rooms for music across the home. It supports Apple’s AirPlay 2 and Spotify Connect for direct playback, too. The new Sonos voice system will be able to take control of music playback duties on the firm’s smart speakers, replacing Google’s Assistant or Amazon’s Alexa. It responds to “Hey Sonos”, and in the US is voiced by the Breaking Bad actor Giancarlo Esposito. The voice control will be available as a free update, allowing users to ask for tracks, skip tracks, adjust the volume and move music between speakers or rooms. All requests will be processed locally on the speakers, making it faster and more private than Google or Amazon’s services as no audio or transcripts will be sent or stored in the cloud. Sonos Voice Control will be available in the US on 1 June and France later this year, with the UK to follow. It will initially work with Sonos Radio, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Deezer and Pandora, with services such as Spotify coming later. The announcement of Sonos’s own voice assistant follows its recent lawsuit win over Google in relation to audio technology patents, after the speaker-maker accused Google and Amazon [paywall] of using its intellectual property while undercutting it with competing devices.",News/Technology,Sonos launches cheaper Ray soundbar and new voice control system,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/11/sonos-launches-cheaper-ray-soundbar-and-new-voice-control-system
