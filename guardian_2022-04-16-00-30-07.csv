4/16/2022,"Of all the spurious arguments advanced for Boris Johnson to stay in office even though he broke the law, there’s one that stands out. Not because it’s the most offensive: in fact, the stink given off by some of the other attempts to defend the prime minister’s behaviour may be even more rank. But this one looms large because its implications are wider and graver. Start with the first of the explanations offered as to why the criminal sanction imposed by the police on Johnson this week – making him the first prime minister ever found to have broken the law in office – should not see his immediate removal from Downing Street: that the lockdown birthday party that prompted a fixed-penalty notice was brief, lasting “less than 10 minutes.” Of course, that’s a risible defence: there was no exemption in the rules for short gatherings. But it’s especially feeble in the case of Johnson because we know that the party in June 2020 was no one-off. On the contrary, even his defenders expect this week’s fines to be the first of several because Johnson was a serial rule-breaker. Second comes Johnson’s insistence that “it did not occur” to him that he was breaking the rules. This is what a lawyer might call the moron defence: that the PM was so stupid that, even though he leads the government that introduced the rules and even though he briefed the nation on those rules almost daily in a televised press conference, he did not know what the rules said. We’re used to Johnson insulting our intelligence, but in this move he insults his own. Third, and most hurtful, comes the Fabricant justification. The eccentrically coiffed MP suggested that Johnson was no more guilty than those teachers and nurses who retreated to “the staff room” after a tough shift to “have a quiet drink”. That remark casually smears all those teachers, nurses and other essential workers who did no such thing, but who instead worked long hours at the safest possible distance, then collapsed into a heap at home from exhaustion. As for those who echoed Michael Fabricant, hinting that, let’s face it, everyone was breaking the rules one way or another, that is both untrue and an unforgivable slur on the vast majority who, in fact, followed Covid instructions to the letter. Worse, it makes fools of those who did so at great human cost, telling every person who bade farewell to a dying parent or partner via a phone, without the consolation of touch, that they were stupid for doing so – that they should have followed Johnson’s example and done whatever they damn well pleased, and to hell with the rules. All of those arguments give off a foul stench. And yet, the most troubling is the one that has now become central to Johnson’s rationale for continuing in office: that it would be wrong to remove a British prime minister while conflict rages in Ukraine. It was put most starkly by the Daily Mail front page headline referring to calls from “the Left” for Johnson’s resignation: “Don’t they know there’s a war on?” Perhaps surprisingly for those who never stop proclaiming their patriotism, such talk betrays ignorance of both British history and the British system of government. Even a nodding acquaintance with Britain’s past would tell you that this country has a habit of dispatching prime ministers in wartime, even during wars in which, unlike the current one in Ukraine, British forces are directly engaged. Odd that 1940 should have slipped the recall of Winston Churchill tribute act Boris Johnson. Odd too that Conservative MPs have apparently forgotten they pushed out Margaret Thatcher in 1990, after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and when everyone knew it was a matter of weeks before British troops would be in combat. Besides, what matters to Ukraine is the position of the UK government, not just its first minister. To be sure, Kyiv is delighted that Johnson visited the city and has been such a vocal supporter, but under our parliamentary, rather than presidential, system, none of that would alter with a change of PM. Given Labour’s position, it wouldn’t even alter with a change of government. Worse than ignorant, the Daily Mail argument is cheaply manipulative. It uses the desperate people of Ukraine as a human shield, exploiting their suffering to cover Johnson’s misconduct. And yet, appalling as all that is, it is not the chief source of its illegitimacy. For that, one need look no further than the resignation letter of David Wolfson, who this week quit as a justice minister. The government, he wrote, could only “credibly defend democratic norms abroad, especially at a time of war in Europe, if we are, and are seen to be, resolutely committed both to the observance of the law and also to the rule of law”. That is the heart of the matter. Far from Partygate being dwarfed into trivial irrelevance by Ukraine, the two are linked in a way that matters greatly. Vladimir Putin’s attempted invasion of his neighbour has stirred the entire west because people understand what is at stake, that this is a battle not simply for territory but for democracy and the rule of law. Putin and his allies across the world have contempt for democratic norms. Their favoured model is rule by strongman at home, the law of the jungle abroad. In his rhetoric, Johnson stands with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. But in his actions he declares his kinship with Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and the others. He writes life-and-death laws which he then breaks, flagrantly and repeatedly. Next, he lies about his lawbreaking to parliament – the same parliament, remember, that he illegally suspended as one of his first acts in power. None of this is in the past. This week, perhaps in an attempt to divert attention away from the Partygate scandal, he announced plans to ship those seeking asylum – including those ultimately found to have a just and fair claim to refuge – to faraway Rwanda, a dictatorship with a record on human rights so bad the UK government raised concerns just last year. It’s likely that the new policy is against the law, “a breach of the right to life, the right not to be subject to inhuman and degrading treatment and the right to be tried before conviction”, according to one legal scholar. But that did not hold Johnson back. On the contrary, he would like nothing more than a court battle, so he can pose as the people’s tribune, once again frustrated by those he pre-emptively referred to in his Rwanda announcement as “an army of politically motivated lawyers”. The pattern is clear: contempt for the law, contempt for those tasked with upholding it. Johnson’s defenders say he must stay in office because of Ukraine. In fact, the war for that country, and the wider struggle it has come to represent, make it all the more urgent that he go.

4/16/2022,"Emmanuel Macron will push for a cap on excessive executive pay should he be re-elected president after he described as “shocking and excessive” the €19m (£15.7m) pay packet handed to the head of carmaker Stellantis. Macron, who is campaigning in the run-up to the final vote for the French presidency on 24 April against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, told France Info radio that he was in favour of an EU-wide ceiling for top executives’ pay. The multimillion-pound payout handed last year to chief executive Carlos Tavares, when French carmaker PSA merged with Italian-US rival Fiat Chrysler to form Stellantis, one of the world’s largest carmakers, has emerged as a prominent issue in the election. Macron and Le Pen are attempting to woo the 7.7 million people who voted in the first round for left-wing candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who has described the final run-off as “a choice between two evils”. A recent poll for France 24 showed 34% of Melenchon voters saying they would back Macron against 30% for Le Pen, while 36% were undecided. “We need to fight at a European level so that remuneration can’t be excessive,” Macron said. “We need to set ceilings and have governance for Europe that make these things acceptable. If not, society will explode at any given moment. “People can’t be facing purchasing power problems … and then see these sorts of sums.” Beyond his base salary of €2m, Tavares is to receive €7.5m in performance-based pay, €2.4m in retirement contributions and a €1.7m bonus related to the success of the merger. In addition, he will also receive €5.6m-worth of company shares, according to Stellantis. In 2017, PSA chief Tavares acquired the European operations of General Motors, giving it control of several plants, including the Ellesmere Port factory on Merseyside, which saw its last Astra leave the production line last week ahead of a shift to electric car models. Stellantis was created in 2019 when the boards of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and the Peugeot owner, Groupe PSA, approved a €40bn (£35bn) merger to rival Toyota, Daimler, GM and Volkswagen. “These sorts of sums are astronomic,” Macron said, who was backed by 9.7 million people in the first round against Le Pen’s tally of 8.1 million. “We need to do what we’ve done with minimum tax rates and the fight against tax evasion. We need to convince our European partners to bring about a reform that will provide a framework for executive pay.” Earlier this week, French government spokesperson Gabriel Attal characterised Tavares’ renumeration as “obviously not normal figures”. Le Pen, who is facing off against Macron in the second and final round of the presidential election on 24 April, has also been drawn into the debate. “It’s shocking, but less shocking than for others,” she said, before appearing to support the bonuses as a reward for the merger deal. “For once he obtained good results,” she said.",News/World news,Macron wants cap on ‘shocking and excessive’ executive pay ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/15/emmanuel-macron-wants-cap-on-executive-pay-france
4/16/2022,"Barclays and Standard Chartered face the prospect of rebellions over executive pay after an influential adviser said investors should vote down pay and pensions packages for executives at the FTSE 100 banks. Investors should defy directors and reject higher base pay for Barclays’ new chief executive and potentially “excessive” pension awards at Standard Chartered, according to Glass Lewis, which advises investors such as pension funds on how to vote at annual meetings. Big companies across the world faced a wave of investor rebellions on pay at annual meetings in 2021 as investors objected to executives profiting during the first year of the pandemic. However, some executive pay packets are expected to rebound in 2022 as bonuses kick in again, and scrutiny is expected particularly in light of the soaring cost of living hitting customers and employees. NatWest Group, formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland, is also under pressure after the proxy adviser this month said shareholders should vote down the government-backed bank’s pay policy because of increased potential rewards for bankers. Barclays boss CS Venkatakrishnan – known as Venkat – was promoted to chief executive in November after the resignation of Jes Staley. Staley stepped down when the UK City regulator raised questions about his description of his links to Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted paedophile and former financier who died in prison in 2021 while awaiting charges of sex trafficking. Venkatakrishnan’s fixed pay was set by Barclays’ remuneration committee at £2.7m, about 12.5% higher than Staley’s. On top of that Venkatakrishnan would also be eligible for a long-term incentive plan worth a maximum of 140% of his salary, or about £3.8m. While the Barclays vote on its remuneration report will only be advisory, scrutiny of his salary would be unwelcome for Venkatakrishnan as he seeks to put the Epstein scandal behind the bank and tries to avoid censure from regulators over potentially “gaming the rules” on capital requirements. Glass Lewis said it was “unable to support this proposal at this time given the newly appointed chief executive’s fixed pay level on appointment”. It also questioned why Venkatakrishnan’s salary was benchmarked against US peers. That “could result in excessive total remuneration opportunity, beyond what we consider to be appropriate for a FTSE-listed bank”, Glass Lewis said. Luke Hildyard, director of the High Pay Centre, a campaign group, said: “It’s surprising given the extent of societal concern about inequality and extreme concentrations of income and wealth that banks continue to put forward such extraordinarily high pay proposals. “For Barclays in particular, a change in chief executive really ought to offer an opportunity to reduce top pay to more sensible, proportionate levels. “These pay awards are made on the notion that only a tiny number of people are capable of filling the role and if they’re not paid enough they’ll go and work elsewhere. But that’s a very debatable assertion and reflects the dim view that the banks have of their own recruitment and training processes, and indeed humanity in general.” Glass Lewis’s objections to Standard Chartered’s remuneration policy, a binding vote which takes place every three years, centre on the way it intends to calculate pension entitlements for executives. It said that incumbent Standard Chartered executives are eligible for higher pensions relative to their pay than the broader workforce, and that there was “no compelling reason” for a new policy to allow departing executives to retain pensions at the same level as if they had stayed on longer. Both banks’ annual meetings will be held on 4 May. A Barclays spokesperson declined to comment on Glass Lewis’s recommendation, referring instead to the bank’s remuneration report. In the report Brian Gilvary, the chair of Barclays’ remuneration committee, justified Venkatakrishnan’s increased pay by saying it “was a reduction from that for his previous role as head of global markets and co-president of Barclays Bank plc”. Barclays has frozen about £22m worth of bonuses for Staley until the regulatory investigations have been completed. Standard Chartered did not respond to requests for comment.",News/Business,"Vote down executive pay at Barclays and Standard Chartered, investors told",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/15/vote-down-executive-pay-at-barclays-and-standard-chartered-investors-told
4/16/2022,"Rail passengers face a “disastrous weekend” of disruption as engineering works and strikes hamper one of the busiest Easter getaways in years. Dozens of services to and from London have been cancelled as Network Rail carries out 530 engineering projects across the bank holiday weekend. There will be no trains on the west coast mainline in or out of Euston station until the end of Monday, which is likely to disrupt football fans heading to the FA Cup semi-final between Manchester City and Liverpool at Wembley. In Scotland and the north of England, TransPennine Express apologised for a “disastrous weekend” ahead as its conductors staged industrial action in a long-running pay dispute. Edmund King, the AA’s president, said the chaos on the rails would steer more people on to the roads as millions enjoy the first Easter weekend in two years without Covid restrictions. As the getaway began on Good Friday, with temperatures of 22C (71.6F) in London making it the warmest day of the year so far, there was gridlock in some areas of the country – although the disruption was not as bad as initially feared. An estimated 4.62m journeys were predicted to be made across the UK, with a further 22.48m across the bank holiday weekend in what could be the busiest in years, according to the RAC. There were large traffic jams on the M20 in Dover as P&O Dover-Calais services remained suspended, with some travellers complaining they missed their ferries after waiting for hours. Images showed huge lines of cars stretching back for miles. Ashley Griffiths-Beamon, 33, and his husband, Damian Griffiths-Beamon, 36, got married on Thursday and were due to travel to Belgium on honeymoon. They were left waiting for 180 minutes at Dover and missed their ferry. “I’m upset and frustrated,” said Ashley. “We had lovely plans for today which have now been ruined.” It came as the temperature soared to 22C in St James’s Park in central London on Good Friday afternoon – a similar climate to Athens and Madrid – and it was expected to rise further. The previous high so far this year was 20.8C recorded in March. North Yorkshire experienced relatively balmy weather on Friday afternoon, with temperatures in Scarborough as warm as in Gibraltar and Istanbul. Rail passengers have been advised to plan ahead and seek alternative routes amid widespread disruption until Monday night. TransPennine Express told customers to avoid its services for the whole weekend. Train links to Heathrow are also disrupted, with a stretch of the Piccadilly tube line shut, while the Gatwick and Stansted Express lines are also closed over the weekend. More than 9,000 flights were scheduled to depart from UK airports between Good Friday and Easter Monday, according to the aviation data firm Cirium. That equates to 78% of the total for the same period before the pandemic in 2019. Good Friday was expected to be the busiest day, when about 2,430 flights were due to depart. Some travellers complained of long queues and cancelled flights on Thursday evening when many looked to get a head start on the getaway, with staff shortages and Covid-related absences blamed for the disruption.",News/UK news,UK rail passengers face ‘disastrous weekend’ of Easter travel disruption,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/15/rail-passengers-face-disastrous-weekend-easter-travel-disruption
4/16/2022,"Doctor Who is perceived to be in the doldrums. Ratings are dwindling and the show has started to feel outclassed by sci-fi contemporaries such as WandaVision or The Mandalorian. It’s a far cry from being the BBC’s jewel in the family drama crown – as it was in 2009, when BBC One’s Christmas idents were all based around David Tennant hitching his Tardis to some flying reindeer. But, for its 60th anniversary next year, the acclaimed screenwriter Russell T Davies is returning as showrunner – and, hopefully, revive the fortunes of the series he once turned into a roaring success. This is what he needs to do to reinvigorate the show. Leave the grim and gritty reboots of beloved characters to the DC movies, and get back to the programme’s adventure roots. It was originally a show featuring action with Doctor Who, not about the character. We don’t need to know that the Doctor is weighed down with the angst of having lived for centuries – we just need to know that something, somewhere is wrong, and needs putting right, that the Doctor and their friends are in danger, and that they are going to get out of it by using brains rather than brawn. The BBC’s budget for Doctor Who is minuscule compared with the amount that Amazon, Disney+, Netflix, et al, can throw at episodes of their sci-fi and fantasy shows. Rather than trying to compete, week by week, the show could ditch the traditional series format, and focus on making two or three movie-length specials each year. That would provide the scope to expand the production budget, while providing extra opportunities for publicity throughout the year. Any sci-fi franchise can do a multiverse or imagined future dystopias. But the Tardis gives Doctor Who the perhaps unique opportunity to take the viewer into the past to meet key historical figures and witness pivotal moments of history – with added alien menace. But why not take that further? Pick up a companion from the 1990s or 1930s or 1880s and set a series mostly in that time period, exploring modern issues through the attitudes of the past. Think Ashes to Ashes, but with monsters. Alternatively, why not force a huge story structure change on to the writers? Jon Pertwee’s Doctor was exiled to Earth – mostly for BBC budgetary reasons – but one twist on the format that hasn’t been done on TV – over an extended period of time – is a Doctor seeking a lost Tardis. The hunt for the time machine would become the MacGuffin of the week, and we would get to see a Doctor hitchhiking their way through the galaxy on a continuous quest. What if there was no one new Doctor? With a quick narrative device to produce an unstable regeneration, you could have a new high-profile Doctor every week. Suddenly it’s possible to hire Hugh Grant, Judi Dench or Riz Ahmed at the Tardis controls, when you only need to persuade them to do a few weeks’ filming – rather than a three-series commitment. Plus, you get all the publicity of the reveal of a new Doctor, over and over again. The curse of a long-lived fantasy franchise is that you end up with grown-up fans demanding increasingly grown-up stories, forgetting that they fell in love with the idea of the show as a child. Russell T Davies could build the fanbase for the next 60 years, with an earlier timeslot, and casting a young Doctor with teenage companions to run riot in space. Shows such as the Sarah Jane Adventures, Creeped Out and MI High have shown that the BBC can produce adventure programmes for older children, with enough nods to movie pastiches, the wider world, and moral lessons to raise a smile from adults, and provide that broader family appeal. Davies once described Doctor Who as “the hardest show to write on television”, but pitched the revival of it to the BBC in the early 000s as simply being about friends having adventures in space. Whatever form it takes in 2023, we can expect a surprise. He told the Radio Times in February that he has already been writing, and that “there are things coming up that are brand new ways of telling the stories that have never been done before, so it just feels new … It’s a self-renewing show.” Doctor Who: Legend of the Sea Devils, starring Jodie Whittaker, airs on BBC One at 7.10pm on Easter Sunday.

On Sean Hannity’s Fox show, Donald Trump called in to say that he would be handling the current crises better than Biden, focusing on Russian’s invasion of Ukraine. Kimmel said if he was in charge now, “he’d be throwing rolls of paper towels at Ukranian refugees”. Hannity tried to, once again, get the former president on record against Putin, but he refused, instead bragging about their friendship. “There are bodybags on screen, [and] he’s bragging about the dudes he knows,” he said. Trump then decided to talk about the danger of windmills and how they are currently killing eagles. “What is the deal with him and windmills?” Kimmel asked. “Did he have a traumatic mini gold experience as a child? Maybe that’s why his hair is like that?” He added: “I feel like the hamster that powers his brain is getting tired right now.” On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert spoke about the arrest of the subway shooting suspect, calling attention to Zack Tahhan, who spotted him on a security camera. “You hear that MTA, cameras work so much better when they work … at all,” Colbert said. There is some dispute over who was the first to identify the suspect, leading to confusion over who would get the $50,000 reward. Allegedly the suspect himself might also have called. “That is gonna be an awkward award ceremony,” he joked. Colbert then said it’s now fine to return to the subway. “It’s just as safe and clean as you remember,” he said. Russian’s continued invasion of Ukraine has led Sweden and Finland to consider joining Nato. “It could be the most shocking Nordic alliance since black licorice joined forced with salt,” he said. Netflix is one of many companies to stop service in Russia which has led to a class-action lawsuit from Russian users. “Then after a few hours, a screen popped up and said are you still suing and they said yes,” he said. Colbert also spoke about the confusing names given to new Covid variants, a forgettable mixture of numbers and letters. “People would take these variants more seriously if you gave them cool names Big Bad Greg or No Good Gretchen,” he said. Elon Musk has become the largest Twitter stakeholder, paying $2.89bn, and he celebrated by posting “a bunch of trolly nonsense” before offering to buy the entire platform for $43bn in cash. “He could do so much with that money,” Colbert said. “Fix world hunger. Address climate change. Get a decent haircut.” Musk wants to make Twitter a platform for free speech. “Twitter is already a platform for free speech across the globe!” C0lbert countered. “You know how I know that? Because no one can stop me from tweeting suck it Elon Musk in every language.” On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah also spoke about Musk and his desire to buy Twitter shares at $54.20, a cannabis joke. “That’s how you know that you’re too rich,” he said. “When you’re spending an extra few million dollars just to slip a weed joke into your takeover bid.” Elon Musk offered to pay $54.20 per share to buy Twitter.

4/16/2022,"The Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, has derided the Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, for owning vast media platforms as Musk himself attempts to buy the vast media platform Twitter. Talking at a Ted conference in Vancouver, Musk accused Zuckerberg of having too much control over public debate given his ownership of Meta, which is the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and other social media sites. “As for media sort of ownership, I mean, you’ve got Mark Zuckerberg owning Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp, and with a share ownership structure that will have Mark Zuckerberg XIV still controlling those entities,” said Musk, seemingly referring to King Louis XIV, the “Sun King” whose wealth and power were legendarily vast. “We won’t have that at Twitter,” added Musk, who is currently bidding to buy Twitter for more than $40bn after failing to join their board of directors this week. Of his potential ownership, Musk has said that he wants to keep the maximum number of shareholders. He currently owns 9.1% of Twitter. According to the Daily Mail, Musk also said he wants to keep Twitter’s algorithm open-source and transparent, as well as allow the site to err on the side of free speech versus censorship. Musk added that Twitter could act as an “inclusive arena for free speech”. News of Musk’s potential Twitter ownership has not gone over well with many Twitter employees. As reported by the Washington Post, while Twitter is a fairly liberal workplace, Musk has frequently caught flak for mocking gender pronouns and sharing Covid-19 misinformation.

4/16/2022,"Darren Gough has defended Joe Root’s leadership after he stepped down after five years as England’s Test captain, insisting there was no one better who could have taken on the role. Root announced his resignation on Friday morning, having come under increasing pressure after a 1-0 series defeat in West Indies followed England’s winter Ashes drubbing. However, Gough, interim managing director of cricket at Yorkshire where Root plays, said: “I think he’s done a good job. I really do. He leads from the front. He’s a strong personality. Everybody thinks he’s this relaxed, fun-loving guy, which he is. But he’s also a strong leader. “You’re only as good as your players. You can be as good a captain as you want. Yes, you might be able to make a little 1% change, but you need the team. Individual players have to come to the party when you really want them. When your best players rock up, it makes such a difference. “I’ve been in that dressing room environment in New Zealand [in November 2019]. He is hugely respected by every single player and coaching staff. And he was the perfect man for the job.” Root led England in a record 64 Tests, winning 27 of them. The team’s recent precipitous loss of form, however, chipped away at his authority. “That one win in 17 [games] is the one that goes against him,” continued Gough, during Yorkshire’s Championship game against Gloucestershire at Bristol. “When you think about it, would you say he’s always had the best players available to him in that last 17 Test matches? I would say not. “He’s had a lot of criticism. I think that’s what probably hurt him, it’s come from a lot of guys who played the game and captained England as well – some of his closest mates. “I was surprised by the criticism. I think you have to look deeper than that. With everything that has been going on in English cricket, I don’t think you can blame the captain. Unfortunately, we’re always looking for someone to blame.” There will be a warm welcome waiting for Root at Headingley, as Yorkshire themselves embark on a rebrand after a winter of revolution and discontent surrounding the Azeem Rafiq racism scandal. Root, who speaks with great affection about county cricket, has made 3,410 first-class runs for the club, averaging 44.28, with eight hundreds. “Whatever we get Joe Root for is a bonus,” said Gough. “He loves playing for Yorkshire. We’ve kept in touch all winter. To get a player of his experience and brilliance, I can’t wait to have him back. And I’m sure he just wants to get back playing now that he’s got this out of the way. “He will continue to be a great ambassador. He has a huge love for this cricket club. He’s been on messages and wished everybody luck before this game. That’s the sort of character he is. He loves playing for Yorkshire and England.”",Sport/Sport,‘You’re only as good as your players’: Darren Gough defends Joe Root’s record,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/youre-only-as-good-as-your-players-darren-gough-defends-joe-roots-record
4/16/2022,"While the British, in recent years at least, have tended towards meat for Easter, in Italy, torta pasqualina, or Easter cake, seeks to make the most of new season’s greens … which, after all, is what most of us are craving after six months of northern darkness. Chef and writer Stefano Arturi calls this Ligurian classic, now popular nationwide, “one of the highlights of the Italian vegetarian canon – the quintessential spring dish”, and, being easy to make ahead, impressive to look at and perfect for feeding a crowd, it works as well for Sunday dinner as it does on an Easter Monday picnic. Though it’s called a torta, this is, in fact, a pie – and, as such, open to the usual pastry-based compromises that always suggest that making the stuff is far more difficult than it actually is. Arturi writes on his Italian Home Cooking blog that the dish demands a “golden, shatteringly flaky olive oil pastry”, traditionally dividing the pie into 33 layers to represent the 33 years of Christ’s life. Thankfully, as Fred Plotkin explains in Recipes from Paradise, “it has evolved in modern times to something that may or may not be 33 layers, but it is still associated with its original inspiration”. You could use ready-made puff pastry, as Yotam Ottolenghi and the Silver Spoon suggest (though Arturi draws the line at that, calling it “untraditional, inauthentic and plain wrong”), but the filo Katie Caldesi recommends in her Italian Cookery Course is a better substitute. Just as with the traditional flour-and-water pastry for which she also gives a recipe, the crisp texture and plain flavour make for a satisfying contrast with the filling; meanwhile, delicious as Rachel Roddy’s avowedly non-traditional butter and ricotta crust is, we find it too soft and rich here. Arturi concedes that “the woman who is these days considered the high priestess of torta pasqualina, and one of the last keepers of traditional Ligurian cooking, Signora Enrichetta Trucco, says that the “33 sheets business” is not compulsory at all: as long as you make between eight and 10 layers, you will be firmly in real torta pasqualina territory. I try using eight, but in relatively small pies of this sort, they tend to go stodgy, so in the end, and with due apology to the signora, I’ve limited myself to a mere six. As further insurance, make sure you stretch out the pastry as thinly as possible, brush it liberally with oil and scatter it with breadcrumbs, as Arturi does, to help absorb some of the liquid from the greens. Swiss chard, Caldesi says, “is used traditionally, but spinach is easier to get hold of”. Yes and no: baby spinach is very easy to get hold of, but, as with spanakopita, this is a dish that demands a more mature leaf; I find tender young ones yield an unpleasantly pulpy texture, so if you can’t find, or don’t like, chard, swap in frozen whole leaf spinach, thawed and squeezed thoroughly dry before use, instead. Chard, however, is fairly widely available these days – cook the stalks and leaves separately, as Ottolenghi suggests, because the former will take much longer. What’s more – and this is vital – wring it out well before adding it to the pie, to ensure as little liquid as possible leaks into the pastry. Plotkin asks the cook to note that “there are alternatives in terms of which vegetables to use. Baby artichokes are available at Easter time, and for many Ligurians are the vegetable of choice when they are in season,” but he also suggests beet greens or borage. Borage being pretty thin on the ground in my greengrocers, and beet greens being not dissimilar to chard, I decide to have a go with baby artichokes, which actually are more forgiving to prep than their full-sized elders, but they are so rare in the UK that it seems a shame to hide them in a pie, nice as the results are. I would suggest using tinned artichoke hearts instead, but I’m too scared of Italians. The main thing is to make sure that whatever you use is dry and well seasoned. Fried onion is the most common choice of aromatic, used by Caldesi, Plotkin, Arturi and Ottolenghi. It gives the filling a savoury note that’s particularly welcome with the earthiness of chard; rather than adding the greens to the same pan, though, which means you’d squeeze out some of the oil along with the water, I’m going to cook them separately, then stir them together at the last minute. Ottolenghi also adds celery, which, because I don’t like celery, won’t be going into my final dish, though his dill is popular – it gives the dish a slightly spanakopita-esque quality that we like, though it doesn’t feel quite as Italian as the parsley with which he combines it. Arturi, the Silver Spoon and Plotkin all use marjoram, which is near impossible to find, but when I do, no one can really taste it, so I’m not going to suggest it unless you happen to have some growing in the garden. More important, in my opinion, is the spicing. Arturi notes that Signora Trucco uses a pinch of an ancient spice blend called la saporita, which contains coriander, cinnamon, caraway seeds, cloves, nutmeg and star anise: “Perhaps a relic of Renaissance cooking, when spices were used much more liberally in Italian cooking than today.” I’m going to nod to that with a generous grating of nutmeg, because that goes so well with both greens and cheese, but any or all of the above, or indeed the warmth of Ottolenghi’s allspice, will work to lift the creamy sweetness of the filling. Traditionally, the cheese layer was made from prescinsêua, a fresh, acidic cheese native to the Ligurian coast, but this, Arturi says, is almost impossible to find outside the region, so most Italians use ricotta instead. (Plotkin notes that it is actually thought to go better with artichokes, in any case.) Only Caldesi uses something else, namely creme fraiche, which proves popular for its tangy flavour, but lacks the body of ricotta – Arturi mixes the two, but I like the lighter texture that Greek yoghurt brings to proceedings, and which I try in Plotkin’s recipe, as opposed to the double cream of the Silver Spoon, which makes the whole thing a bit loose. Beaten eggs, though not mandatory, give the cheese layer a pleasant, moussey consistency. You could season it well and leave it at that, but this is a special-occasion dish, so most recipes add grated parmesan (vegetarians should note that most hard cheeses will work here; Ottolenghi even adds some distinctly un-Italian cheddar). Modern recipes tend to mix the greens and cheese, but I like Plotkin’s idea of keeping them separate, as I suspect the original, multi-layer version would have done – it’s more interesting to eat and looks more striking. He also suggests putting a layer of pastry in the middle as a divider, but we find this both unpleasantly gummy and unnecessary. Eggs aren’t mandatory, either – Arturi quite reasonably says he doesn’t care for the flavour or texture of overcooked yolks – but they do feel festive at this time of year, and they certainly look very pretty, too. Traditionally, they go on top, but I like the colour contrast with the greens, so I’m going to put them in the bottom layer. You’ll need to be careful not to break the yolks when you add the top layer, but if I can manage it, believe me, so can you. Leave to cool to warm room temperature before serving, to give the filling a chance to set. Prep 20 minRest 1 hr+Cook 1 hr 15 minServes 6-8 For the pastry (or use 500g filo)300g plain flour½ tsp fine salt30ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for brushing For the filling1kg Swiss chard or spinach (if using frozen spinach, you’ll need about 2kg; thaw and squeeze out, then add in step 4)1 onion, peeled and finely chopped2 tbsp olive oil250g ricotta150g full-fat Greek yoghurt5 eggs (all but 1 optional)50-75g finely grated parmesanNutmeg, grated1 handful breadcrumbs For the pastry, put the flour and salt in a large bowl and make a well in the middle. Add the oil and about 75ml tepid water, stir, then add just enough additional water to bring everything together into a coherent but not sticky dough. Knead well until smooth, then cover with a damp cloth and leave for at least an hour – if you want to leave it for longer, chill and bring back to room temperature before use. (You can also use a food mixer to mix the dough.) Meanwhile, if using chard, separate the stems, cut them into roughly 1cm pieces, then wash. Heat a large pan for which you have a lid on a medium-low flame, and add the chard stalks. Cover and leave to steam, shaking occasionally, while you chop and wash the leaves (if you have a thin-based pan and are worried about it sticking, add a splash of oil). Add the chard leaves to the pan, cover and cook, shaking occasionally, until wilted. When cool enough to handle, transfer the chard to a clean tea towel or a piece of muslin, and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. (If using fresh spinach, chop and cook it all together. Frozen spinach, on the other hand, should be defrosted and squeezed out.) Heat the oil in a wide pan and fry the chopped onion until soft but not coloured. Add the squeezed chard and toss to mix with the onion and oil. Season with salt and nutmeg, then leave to cool. Drain off any liquid from the ricotta and yoghurt, then mix. Add one egg, beat well, then stir in the parmesan and a little nutmeg, and season. Lightly grease a deep 24cm-wide tart tin, and heat the oven and a baking tray to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Divide the pastry into six equal pieces and cover so they don’t dry out. Combine two pieces, roll into a large ball, then roll out or stretch on a lightly floured surface until it’s as thin as you can get it and large enough generously to line the tin. Lay the pasty into the tin, allowing the excess to overhang the sides, then brush all over with oil. Roll out the third piece of pastry as thinly as possible, cut it to the size of the tin and lay on top of the pastry base. Oil and repeat with a fourth piece of pastry, then oil the top layer and scatter over the breadcrumbs. Spoon the chard on top of this, then make four wide divots in the greens. Crack an egg, if using, into each, and season. Carefully spoon the cheese on top, trying not to push it down too hard on the eggs so the yolks stay intact. Roll out the penultimate piece of pastry, brush with oil and lay it on top, then roll out the final piece and stretch this over everything, to enclose. Press the edges together to seal, then trim and crimp (watch a video online if you’re not sure how to do this). Cut several slashes in the top layer, to help the pastry cook through, make a small hole in the centre to let steam escape from the filling during baking, then brush with more oil. Bake for 45-55 minutes, or until golden, then remove and leave to cool to room temperature before slicing and serving.

4/16/2022,"Nothing will dislodge Native Trail from the top of the betting for the 2,000 Guineas after his successful return in Thursday’s Craven Stakes at Newmarket, but two dual Group One-winning juveniles – Angel Bleu and Perfect Power – line up the Greenham Stakes at Newbury on Saturday and Christophe Soumillon’s arrival to partner Perfect Power is an added attraction. Soumillon rode Perfect Power to victory in the Prix Morny and the Middle Park Stakes last season, the latter race being his first ride in Britain since the Royal meeting in 2019. It was classic Soumillon, as he emerged from behind a wall of horses after dropping in from a poor draw and then fired Richard Fahey’s colt through a gap to win going away. Perfect Power (3.00) has yet to race beyond six furlongs while Angel Bleu, successful in the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere and Criterium International last year, is already a Group One winner at a mile. He has plenty of stamina on the dam’s side of his pedigree, however, and the seven-furlong trip should hold no fears. It is a slight surprise to find him chalked up as second-favourite and anything around 9-4 looks well worth taking. Musselburgh 1.32 Nine of the 10 runners are making their seasonal debut, but Desert Angel made a solid return to action in a well-run race at Wolverhampton last month and that might just tip the balance. Newbury 1.50 Raymond Tusk was value for more than his four-length margin at Doncaster last time and has a fitness edge on most of his rivals. Musselburgh 2.04 Track, trip and going look ideal for Gweedore, and Andrew Breslin takes off a useful 3lb too. Newbury 2.25 At the likely odds, Jumbly could be worth in interest to follow up an easy Listed win – in a useful time – in October, not least as her dam, Thistle Bird, improved with age throughout her career. Musselburgh 2.39 Many possibilities in a competitive sprint handicap but Makanah has plenty of form over track and trip, and has gone well fresh in the past.

Newbury 3.35 Several of these ran well in the Lincoln, including Rogue Bear, who finished strongly into third after losing ground at the start. He is no value at around 7-2 however, not least as he might need things his own way, and front-running Isla Kai, progressive throughout 2021 with the promise of better to come, is an interesting each-way option at around 14-1.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: bank on Perfect Power to grab Greenham glory,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/15/talking-horses-bank-on-2000-guineas-hope-perfect-power-to-grab-greenham-glory-horse-racing-tips
