3/26/2022,"Russia has used more than 1,100 missiles in Ukraine since its invasion last month, Reuters reported. But missiles used by Russia are seeing failure rates as high as 60%, US officials said. The officials were not able to provide Reuters with evidence of their assessment. As many as 60% of Russia's missile strikes on Ukraine fail to launch or don't explode on impact, three US officials with knowledge of intelligence on the issue, told Reuters. The Pentagon believes that Russia has launched more than 1,100 missiles since its full invasion of Ukraine just over a month ago, US officials told reporters this week, according to Reuters. But the precision-guided missiles, including air-launched cruise missiles, fired by Russian forces are seeing failure rates as high as 60%, two of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. One official estimated the rate could be as high as 50%. The officials said that the failure rate depended on the type of missile being launched and varied day-to-day. They did not say why the rate could be so high, nor did they provide Reuters with any evidence of their assessment. Since the start of the conflict, images of Russian missiles and bombs lodged in Ukraine's streets and buildings have emerged online. Insider was unable to verify them. Last week, Ukrainian forces captured 24 intact Russian missiles near the northwestern city of Hostomel and fired them back at Russian troops. This tactic has been used before by Ukrainian forces, focusing on repairing damaged Russian equipment captured in the fighting and then sending them back into battle.

 President Biden on Thursday had a sharp response to a reporter who asked why he though the latest sanctions would change Russian President Vladimir Putin's behavior after previous steps did not stop Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. ""Let's get something straight ... I did not say that in fact the sanctions would deter him,"" Biden said at a press conference from Brussels, where he is meeting with NATO leaders. ""Sanctions never deter - you keep talking about that - sanctions never deter. The maintenance of sanctions, the maintenance of sanctions, the increasing the pain and the demonstration, why I asked for this NATO meeting today, is to be sure that after a month, we will sustain what we're doing not just next month, the following month, but for the remainder of this entire year, that's what will stop him,"" the president said, raising his voice. Asked if he believes NATO's latest actions on Thursday will lead Russia to change course, Biden said, ""That's not what I said. You're playing a game with me."" ""The answer's no,"" he added. The Biden administration on Thursday announced sanctions on more than 300 Russian lawmakers and dozens of state-owned companies that are connected to the war effort in the invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, NATO announced the establishment of four new battle groups in Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary and agreed to strengthen cyber defenses and equipment to help Ukraine, including providing detection equipment, protection and medical supplies, and training for decontamination and crisis management. Biden said that the most important thing is for the United States and its allies to stay united. ""The single most important thing is for us to stay unified and the world continue to focus on what a brute this guy is and all the innocent peoples' lives are being lost and ruined and what's going on. That's the important thing,"" Biden told reporters. ""But look, if you're Putin and you think that Europe is going to crack in a month or six weeks or two months, why not - they can take anything for another month. But we have to demonstrate,"" he said. ""The reason I asked for the meeting, we have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly united.""",Politics/The Hill,Biden has sharp response to reporter: 'You're playing a game with me',https://news.yahoo.com/biden-sharp-response-reporter-youre-182916191.html
3/26/2022,"Former President Donald Trump is scheduled to sit for another deposition. It's for a case where he's accused of promoting a scam multi-level marketing scheme on ""The Celebrity Apprentice."" Eric and Donald Trump Jr. are also scheduled for depositions, with one pending for Ivanka Trump. Former President Donald Trump and his two eldest sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., are scheduled to sit for depositions for a civil lawsuit alleging they promoted a scam multi-level marketing scheme. The ex-president is scheduled to sit for the deposition on June 16. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump will sit for their own on May 10 and May 12 respectively, according to a new court filing, which was signed by attorneys representing the Trump family members. The parties have not yet agreed on a deposition date for Ivanka Trump, also a defendant in the lawsuit. The Trump family members will take the depositions as part of a long-running lawsuit against them, the Trump Organization, and a multi-level marketing company called ACN. As Insider's Yelena Dzhanova reported, four plaintiffs sued after saying they lost thousands of dollars from joining ACN and trying to sell its telephones with video capabilities. Trump and his family members had promoted ACN extensively on ""The Celebrity Apprentice"" in 2009 and 2011 — years after the release of the iPhone — and had done numerous live events and promotional interviews. The deal with ACN, and the work Trump did on the show, had helped Trump survive financial ruin, according to a New York Times analysis of his tax records. ACN and Trump have denied wrongdoing and say the lawsuit is politically motivated. As with many lawsuits filed against Trump, the one against ACN and his family had stalled during his presidency. Since he left office in 2021, it has moved slowly through the discovery phase. The new filing is a status update on the discovery phase from attorneys representing both the plaintiffs and the Trump family members. It says that MGM, which produced ""The Celebrity Apprentice,"" gave the former ACN members' lawyers unaired footage from the show to use in the lawsuit. ""Plaintiffs have completed their on-site review of unaired footage from two episodes of The Celebrity Apprentice, and have designated certain footage (under 50% of the total footage) that Plaintiffs believe is relevant for copying, with Plaintiffs bearing the reasonable costs,"" the lawyers wrote. ""Nonparties Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. and JMBP, LLC have copied and provided in full the media assets designated by Plaintiffs during the initial phase of their review."" Trump has sat for only one deposition since leaving office, in October, for a lawsuit alleging his security guards roughed up protesters outside of Trump Tower in 2015. The New York Attorney General's office has also subpoenaed him and his eldest children for its civil investigation into whether the Trump Organization broke financial laws by misrepresenting property values. The Trump Organization is appealing a judge's decision ordering them to sit for depositions in that case.
