2/8/2022,"Nvidia’s planned $40bn (£29.6bn) acquisition of the Cambridge-based chip designer Arm from Japan’s Softbank has collapsed, the companies said on Tuesday, after regulatory hurdles proved insurmountable. The cash-and-stock deal was announced in 2020 but the US Federal Trade Commission sued to block it in December, arguing that competition in the nascent markets for chips in self-driving cars and a new category of networking chips could be hurt if Nvidia carried out the purchase.  The buyout also faced scrutiny in the UK and the EU amid concerns that it could push up prices and reduce choice and innovation. It had yet to receive approval in China, which has previously withheld approval of cross-border chip acquisitions. SoftBank said on Tuesday that Arm would now prepare for a stock market floatation before the end of the financial year to 31 March 2023. The sale would have marked an early exit from Arm for SoftBank, which acquired it for $32bn, and the collapse of the deal marks a big setback to the Japanese conglomerate’s efforts to generate funds at time when valuations across its portfolio are under pressure. Arm said in a separate statement that it had appointed Rene Haas as its chief executive officer, effective immediately. A chip industry veteran, Haas joined Arm in 2013 and before that worked seven years at Nvidia. “Rene is the right leader to accelerate Arm’s growth as the company looks to re-enter the public markets,” the SoftBank chief executive, Masayoshi Son, said in the statement from Arm. SoftBank said that Arm’s net sales rose 40% to $2bn in the nine months to December compared with the same period a year ago. An Arm acquisition would have put Nvidia into even more intense competition with rivals in the data centre chip market such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Arm licenses its architecture and technology to customers such as Qualcomm, Apple and Samsung that design chips for devices from mobile phones to computers. The Japanese investment company said it would recognise $1.25vb breakup fee that Nvidia had deposited as a profit in the fourth quarter.",News/Business,Nvidia’s $40bn takeover of UK chip designer Arm collapses,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/08/nvidia-takeover-arm-collapses-softbank
2/8/2022,"Scott Morrison has secured the support of the Coalition party room for amendments to the government’s religious discrimination bill that only partially protect gay students and overlook trans students entirely. Liberal MP Bridget Archer said she would nevertheless oppose the bill, telling parliament on Tuesday evening she was “horrified” and “utterly distressed” the government amendments excluded children that identified as transgender.  “After so much progress how did we get back to a place where we ignore the harm we place on children when we tell them they are ‘other’, ‘less than’ and do not deserve rights and protections afforded to others – I fear it may risk lives,” Archer said. Olivia Stewart, a transgender student, told reporters in Canberra the lack of protection for trans students had “impacted my mental health” while other trans people noted it was “intensely distressing to see our basic rights up for debate”. The Coalition party room backed the controversial bill despite at least six Liberal MPs expressing their concerns. It endorsed limited changes to the religious bill and the Sex Discrimination Act during an extended meeting after question time. The Morrison government confirmed it proposed to protect gay students from expulsion – but not other forms of discrimination – without protecting trans students at the same time. Anna Brown, the chief executive of LGBTQ+ lobby group Equality Australia, said the government amendments were “completely inadequate” because they “fail to protect gay children” from suspension, detention and unfair treatment – and left behind the most vulnerable, being trans children. Stewart said she had been “directly discriminated against” by a school when she wanted to come out as trans in year 8. She said the school first warned her that she and her twin brother would be bullied and that revealing her gender identity would compromise her leadership potential. She was eventually invited to leave the school. Former swimming champion Ian Thorpe said on Tuesday that parliamentarians must do everything they could to protect trans youth who were the “most marginalised” voices in the debate. Thorpe said the bill amounted to “state-sanctioned discrimination”. “When you look at some of the most marginalised and disadvantaged people in this country, this is a group of people that we should be protecting,” the LGBT+ advocate told reporters. “It becomes state-sanctioned discrimination to gain rights for one group of people, whilst excluding another group of people.” The prime minister stressed the need for government unity telling the party room it otherwise risked losing the upcoming election. He warned any further amendments were not government policy unless endorsed by another meeting. Guardian Australia understands that Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman expressly reserved his position, a procedural courtesy expected of members before they cross the floor, while others including Katie Allen are still negotiating with the attorney general and believe further amendments could be added. Archer, the member for Bass who told Guardian Australia on Friday she could not vote for the bill in its current form, confirmed in parliament she would oppose it. The Liberal MP cited concerns about overriding state laws on religious institutions’ ability to discriminate in hiring and firing and statements of religious belief. Like many trans folks, I feel like garbage today. It’s intensely distressing to see our basic rights up for debate. And it’s beyond painful to contemplate how this will affect trans kids. Do not underestimate the detrimental impact of this ‘debate’ on trans well-being. After years of waiting to see the final version of the bill, attention will now swing back to Labor, which is yet to decide its position. Qualified support from opposition MPs and senators in two parliamentary inquiries suggests Labor could provide a viable pathway for the Coalition to pass its bill. Liberal MP Fiona Martin, a psychologist with 20 years experience, argued in the party room for broader protections and said children with gender identity issues were one of the most vulnerable cohorts. Martin noted there were higher rates of depression and suicidal ideation among young people with gender identity issues – although not all ended up requesting a gender transition. The attorney general, Michaelia Cash, told the party room that preventing discrimination on the grounds of gender identity could harm the ability of religious schools to set their ethos and the Coalition should wait for the Australian Law Reform Commission review that would report back 12 months after the religious bill passed parliament. Zimmerman, Julian Simmonds and Warren Entsch also expressed concerns with the religious discrimination bill in the party room. Andrew Laming publicly warned preventing expulsion was “simply not enough”. Laming told parliament that LGBTQ+ students “are usually not expelled”. “Too often they’re bullied out by a range of other tactics that allow the school to say they never expelled them.” Senator Andrew Bragg, in his additional comments to one of the inquiries and again in the party room, called for teachers to be protected and the statement of belief clause to be removed. With the limited amendments preventing expulsion on the grounds of sexuality, Morrison preserved the support of conservative Christian groups including the Australian Christian Lobby and Christian Schools Australia. The Liberal MP Angie Bell was won over by the changes although they fall short of a deal in December to prevent both sexuality and gender discrimination by religious schools and a commitment Morrison gave to Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, in writing on 1 December to prevent “any form of discrimination against a student on the basis of sexuality or gender identity”. On Tuesday morning, Morrison said the government had been “very clear that this was a bill that we wanted to see passed, so it will go to the parliament”. Even if the bill passes the lower house, the government may need Labor support to smooth its path in the Senate, where One Nation and Liberals Gerard Rennick and Alex Antic have vowed not to vote for government legislation in protest of its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Several Labor MPs have spoken up about the failure to protect trans students but it is unclear whether that will translate to support for amendments or whether Labor will simply wave the bill through to avoid being wedged on religion ahead of the election. “There’s an opportunity to draw a line in the sand and have this behind us once and for all,” one Labor parliamentarian told Guardian Australia. “We need to stop talking about things the public don’t want us to talk about.” On Friday, Labor MPs and senators on two committees joined the government in calling for the bill to pass after a series of minor and technical changes, a sign it may not insist on stronger protections of LGBTQ+ students or seek to remove the religious bill’s most controversial clauses. On Tuesday, the Labor MP Graham Perrett, the deputy chair of one of the inquiries, criticised aspects of the bill including the statement of belief and employment practices clauses, but described the rest of it as “largely uncontroversial”. Perrett told parliament it was “utterly repugnant” for schools to be allowed to use contracts to discriminate against LGBTQ+ children. Parents of trans kids worry themselves sick every time their child leaves the house. Will they be physically attacked for being themselves.Scott Morrison should put himself in the shoes of those parents or the heels of their kids. Ask “what do I want Parliament to say to them?” A spokesman for the Hindu Council of Australia said the bill allowed discrimination in hiring by religious institutions against members of small or new religious groups in Australia because they don’t have schools and hospitals. Staff face pressure to convert if they find a job at the institution of another religion, he said. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said the Morrison government was “trying to ram through a Trojan Horse for hate”. “[The] religious discrimination bill will mean more discrimination, not less, and Labor looks like it’s about to support it.” In Australia, support is available at Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636 and Lifeline on 13 11 14",News/Australia news,‘Utterly distressed’: Liberal MP to vote against religious bill that fails to protect transgender students ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/08/utterly-distressed-liberal-mp-to-vote-against-religious-bill-that-fails-to-protect-transgender-students
2/8/2022,"Igrew up in a household where we all voted Conservative. I live in a constituency that has voted Tory for the past decade. And if you’d said to me a few years ago that I’d be voting for another party, or perhaps not voting at all, I wouldn’t have believed you. But here I am. Because after seeing how the Conservatives have handled this pandemic, I will never vote for anyone associated with this government. As for the Tory party: our 31-year relationship is over. Like many people, growing up I took my political cues from my dad. On 11 August last year, at 3.03pm, he passed away after a short battle against Covid, a disease that lasted a mere 11 days from when he first tested positive. He was one of the millions of shielders in the UK who were given a stark choice on “freedom day” last July: stay a prisoner in your own home or risk your life when venturing out. He was 76 and double vaccinated, with an underlying condition for which he took immunosuppressants. But he was full of life and vigour and hope. He wanted to live out his retirement safely and peacefully.And then came freedom day on 19 July. This was a politically charged decision to pretend Covid wasn’t a danger any more. My dad was as cautious as he could be. All he did was go to the shops to buy food and attend his medical appointments. Yet even that was enough to kill him. He was utterly let down by those in power, who he had trusted to make the right decisions and protect vulnerable people.  Tragically, we’re living through the whole process again, as the plan B restrictions introduced to fight the Omicron variant are lifted in England – despite the fact that there are still hundreds of people dying every day. I can’t tell you how painful it is to think of other families going through the same trauma as mine, all because the same mistakes are being repeated in Westminster. Of course, any restrictions the government introduces in the future if we face new, more dangerous variants will probably be pointless. Who will listen to rules from a government that couldn’t care less about obeying the rules themselves? My dad passed away from Covid-19 on his own, without his family at his side. We barely saw him during the previous 18 months, as we did everything we could to protect each other and our communities. We missed out on every family gathering. We couldn’t see my dad when he was sick with Covid. He was so poorly when he caught the virus that I couldn’t even speak to him. When he entered hospital we couldn’t be near him or help him. And once he was in the ICU, that was it. We spent hours trying to get someone to give us updates or find a doctor with whom we could discuss treatment options. But even when someone answered the phone you could hardly hear what they were saying through all the PPE. We couldn’t say goodbye. And that will live with me for ever. Meanwhile, politicians and their advisers in 10 Downing Street were apparently breaking their own laws, regularly and obnoxiously. Every news story about yet more Downing Street parties has been devastating for those who have lost loved ones to Covid. The pandemic has been unbelievably hard on so many people. But those who stuck to the rules can at least say we did everything to protect others. That’s something some of those working in Downing Street cannot say. Boris Johnson is a disgrace and an embarrassment. To hear him brag about his handling of a pandemic that has killed more than 175,000 people in Britain is nauseating. Several parties he allegedly attended are now under police investigation, after he repeatedly insisted all guidelines were followed. Just as bad are the Tory MPs who keep him in power. The prime minister has lost all credibility. He has become a walking public health hazard who puts lives at risk. But all the Conservatives seem to care about is how he affects their electoral fortunes. It’s painful to watch them try to defend his actions; they disgrace their country every time they do so. I would love to believe that the problem is just Johnson, but the pandemic has shown that the rot runs much deeper. It goes to the heart of the Conservative party. Why did they stick with the prime minister as his government stumbled from one pandemic disaster to the next? Why did they line up to defend Dominic Cummings when he broke lockdown rules, and do the same again for Johnson? Ask yourself: who will they replace him with? Rishi Sunak, who has remained notably quiet about the prime minister’s misconduct? Sajid Javid, who accused families like mine of “cowering” from the virus? A lifetime of voting habits die hard. And I know there are many Conservatives who will dismiss this piece, as I would have done a few years ago. But the Tories have shown that they’re not interested in protecting ordinary families. They seem more like a knock-off version of Donald Trump’s Republican party than that of Winston Churchill. I urge you not to vote for them.

2/8/2022,"Thousands of demonstrators have successfully occupied Canada’s frigid capital for days, and say they plan on staying as long as it takes to thwart the country’s vaccine requirements.  The brazen occupation of Ottawa came as a result of unprecedented coordination between various anti-vaccine and anti-government organizations and activists, and has been seized on by similar groups around the world. It may herald the revenge of the anti-vaxxers. The so-called “freedom convoy” – which departed for Ottawa on 23 January – was the brainchild of James Bauder, an admitted conspiracy theorist who has endorsed the QAnon movement and called Covid-19 “the biggest political scam in history”. Bauder’s group, Canada Unity, contends that vaccine mandates and passports are illegal under Canada’s constitution, the Nuremberg Code and a host of other international conventions. Bauder has long been a fringe figure, but his movement caught a gulf stream of support after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced last year that truckers crossing the US-Canada border would need to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19. The supposed plight of the truckers proved to be a compelling public relations angle and attracted an array of fellow travelers. Until now, a litany of organizations had protested Canada’s strict public health measures, but largely in isolation. One such group, Hold Fast Canada, had organized pickets of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s headquarters, where they claimed that concentration camps had already been introduced in the country. Another group, Action4Canada, launched legal challenges to mask and vaccine mandates. In one 400-page court filing, they allege that the “false pronouncement of a Covid-19 ‘pandemic’” was carried out, at least in part, by Bill Gates and a “New World (Economic) Order” to facilitate the injection of 5G-enabled microchips into the population. Both groups are listed as “participating groups” on the Canada Unity website, and sent vehicles and personnel to join the convoy. Other organizers joined Bauder, including Chris Barber, a Saskatchewan trucker who was fined $14,000 in October for violating provincial public health measures; Tamara Lich, an activist for a fringe political party advocating that Western Canada should become an independent state; Benjamin Dichter, who has warned of the “growing Islamization of Canada”; and Pat King, an anti-government agitator who has repeatedly called for Trudeau to be arrested. Since they have arrived in Ottawa, the extreme elements of the protest have been visible: neo-Nazi and Confederate flags were seen flying, QAnon logos were emblazoned on trucks and signs and stickers were pasted to telephone poles around the occupied area bear Trudeau’s face, reading: “Wanted for crimes against humanity.” The official line from Bauder and his co-organizers, however, has remained focused; in a Facebook live broadcast, Bauder instructed his supporters to “stop talking about the vaccine” and instead stick to message of “freedom”. Such strict message control has attracted mainstream support. Numerous members of the Conservative party, Canada’s official opposition, have come out to meet the protesters. Elon Musk and Donald Trump have both endorsed the convoy. Fox broadcasters Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson have provided glowing updates on the continuing occupation. Bauder vowed the convoy would camp out in Ottawa until their demands are met, insisting to his followers that a “memorandum of understanding” would force the government’s hand, possibly even triggering fresh elections, if enough people sign. A Canada Unity organizer went further, saying it would require the Senate to “go after the prime minister” for “corruption” and “fascism”. There is no legal basis for those claims. King has laid out a more direct plan of action to the occupiers: “What we want to focus on is our politicians, their houses, their locations,” he said in a January Facebook stream. If political pressure doesn’t work, King said, blocking major supply chains “will be later on”. Soon after, the head of security for Parliament issued an extraordinary warning to Members of Parliament to avoid the protest entirely, for their own safety. The occupiers have deliberately made life difficult for anyone in Ottawa’s downtown core. Trucks have been laying on their air horns throughout the day, often well into the early morning hours. An Ottawa court granted an injunction Monday afternoon, ordering that the honking must cease. In the shadow of Parliament, a flatbed truck was converted into a stage – functioning as a speaker’s corner during the day, where far-right politicians and occupiers took the microphone to decry Trudeau and Covid vaccines. At night, the stage functions as a DJ booth for raucous dance parties. Technology has made the occupation even easier: drivers share information on routes and the best ways to evade police barricades via the walkie talkie app Zello. Organizers in other cities use the secure messaging app Telegram to share information, coordinate messaging and plan solidarity protests. The occupiers now have the resources to stay for an extended period of time: they have raised more than C$6mthrough various crowdfunding platforms, in cash and Bitcoin, despite having been booted from GoFundMe’s platform after raising over C$10m. The Ottawa occupation is proof that a few thousand determined protesters can overwhelm police and shut down major cities with enough vehicles and coordination. Solidarity convoys have already shut down the busy Coutts border crossing between Alberta and Montana, strained police resources in Toronto and Quebec City, and activists as far away as Helsinki, Canberra, London, and Brussels have taken not. On the convoy channels, protestors warn this is just the beginning.",News/World news,Neo-Nazis and QAnon: how Canadian truckers’ anti-vaccine protest was steered by extremists,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/canada-ottawa-trucker-protest-extremist-qanon-neo-nazi
2/8/2022,"Wayne Rooney was, by his own admission, never all that interested in school. But one subject intrigued him more than others: religious studies. The young Rooney was raised as a Catholic, attended a local primary called Our Lady and St Swithin’s in Croxteth, said his prayers most evenings and still considers himself a man of devout faith. “Wayne’s recall of stories about the life of Jesus is quite detailed,” read an early school report. In late 2010 Rooney was in turmoil. His frustration at Manchester United had bubbled over into a sensational transfer request. Immediately, however, he was overcome by guilt and self-reproach. “My mind goes into another spin,” he writes in his autobiography. “I feel gutted at what I’ve done. How stupid are you, Wayne? What are you doing?” As it turned out, his desperation for forgiveness – to absolve his wrongs – would provide the fuel for his last great season as a player.  Rooney’s career lends itself to all kinds of different themes but perhaps the most powerful is this idea of guilt and redemption. Many footballers have erred like Rooney but few repent quite like him. When he was sent off in a crucial World Cup qualifier in 2011, he insisted on writing a personal letter of apology to Uefa. There is an anguished, almost childlike penitence there, one that in our current age of faux-emoting and corporate non-apologies feels almost refreshing. Rooney does not just request forgiveness; he supplicates and begs for it, almost as if the pain of sinning is worse than the punishment. Take, by way of further example, an interview Rooney conducted to promote his new Amazon documentary. Most of the media coverage centred on his admissions of alcohol misuse at the height of his fame: not a new revelation but one that allowed lots of websites to put the words “Rooney” and “booze” next to each other in a headline. But one of the more revealing snippets was his guilt at going to the 2006 World Cup despite not being fully fit. “To this day, I feel terrible for Jermain Defoe,” he discloses. “I literally took his spot at the World Cup and took his dream away.” Never mind that even a half-fit Rooney was probably worth the gamble, given his talent and form. Never mind that Defoe’s omission owed more to Sven-Göran Eriksson’s bizarre decision to pick the uncapped teenager Theo Walcott. Somehow – almost 16 years later – Rooney still feels a sense of personal remorse, a regret that eats away at him, to the point where he feels the need to unburden himself publicly. What else is locked away in there? The reason for dredging all this up now is Derby County. It is just over a year since Rooney took on his first managerial role, a job that has since turned into a particularly undignified form of masochism. Administration – which Rooney found out about on Sky Sports News – was followed by a 21-point deduction and almost certain relegation to League One. Liquidation remains a distinct possibility. At the start of the January transfer window Rooney was assured by the administrators that no player sales would be required. Nine players ended up leaving. Meanwhile it is down to Rooney to salvage the wreckage left by the former owner, Mel Morris. Training equipment and away travel have been paid out of his own pocket. At times the strain and workload have forced Rooney to sleep in his office. And remember, this is perhaps the most famous English footballer of his generation, a man who could walk away tomorrow with his reputation enhanced and a clutch of superior job offers on the table. What, exactly, is he still doing there? The uncharitable view – because this is modern football and there must always be an ulterior motive – is that Rooney is sticking around out of self-interest, to make himself look good. It’s a free hit, a dire situation that absolves him of any blame for failure. I don’t buy that. Nobody willingly puts a relegation on their CV for the kudos. But there also seems to be something more complex going on here than simple species loyalty. For all Rooney’s many qualities as a footballer, when it came to career decisions he was often ruthlessly pragmatic. He did not hesitate to leave Everton when United came calling or to hand in a transfer request when he felt United’s ambitions no longer matched his. For this he was frequently demonised and patronised, held up as an exemplar of the modern footballer’s entitlement and moral degeneracy. And yet, nobody could ever be more reproachful of Rooney than Rooney himself. “I wouldn’t forgive myself if I walked out [at Derby],” he has said. “What kind of person would I be if I went and laid on a beach for two weeks?” This is the Rooney guilt complex at work again: a decision borne not of ego but of duty, not out of positive incentives but of a mortal fear of judgment. It is the decision, in other words, of a man who has long equated suffering with salvation, who learned from the earliest age that every choice must ultimately be weighed and accounted for. Watch him the next time he’s standing in the dugout. He doesn’t look thrilled to be there. He’s not doing it for plaudits or slaps on the back or a shot at the United job. He’s just a man who has endured enough long nights of the soul to know that the alternative is far, far worse.",Sport/Football,Wayne Rooney searches for redemption amid wreckage at Derby | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/08/wayne-rooney-desperately-searches-for-redemption-amid-the-wreckage-at-derby
2/8/2022,"BP has reported a quarterly profit of more than $4bn (£2.96bn) and annual profits hit an eight-year high as it benefited from a surge in energy prices around the world. The oil company’s underlying profit of $4.1bn in the final quarter of 2021 compares with just $115m a year before. Over the year as a whole, BP made a profit of $12.8bn as global gas markets surged and oil prices rallied to seven-year highs. It compared with a $5.7bn loss in 2020.  The bumper profits are likely to prompt fresh calls for a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies to fund extra help for hard-hit households braced for a sharp rise in energy bills and wider cost of living crisis. Last week, BP’s rival, Shell, reported a quadrupling of profits. In December the BP chief executive, Bernard Looney, said the energy crisis had transformed the company into a “cash machine”. Commenting on the results on Tuesday, Looney said: “2021 shows BP doing what we said we would – performing while transforming. We’ve strengthened the balance sheet and grown returns. We’re delivering distributions to shareholders with $4.15bn of buybacks announced and the dividend increased. “And we’re investing for the future. We’ve made strong progress in our transformation to an integrated energy company: focusing and high grading our hydrocarbons business, growing in convenience and mobility and building with discipline a low carbon energy business now with over 5GW in offshore wind projects – and significant opportunities in hydrogen.”",News/Business,BP reports bumper profits due to soaring gas and oil prices,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/08/bp-profits-gas-oil-prices-shell-energy-crisis-windfall-tax
