1/12/2022,"Rolling Stone magazine has called it “incredible balm”, and the New York Times extolled its “cheerful optimistic tone”. American viewers are enthralled by its bucolic setting, the small, everyday dramas and its old-fashioned sense of community. And, of course, the animals. All Creatures Great and Small, the small-screen adaptation of a series of novels by James Herriot, the pen name of Yorkshire vet Alf Wight, has become a surprising hit in the home of fast-paced thrillers and warring dynasties.  Season 2, which started in the US at the weekend, has joined other British exports of gentle television that have won a place in American hearts. Bake-Off, The Repair Shop and – the grande dame of them all – Downton Abbey have shown US audiences that sex, violence, celebrities and swearing are not essential to success. Samuel West, who plays down-to-earth vet Siegfried Farnon in the Channel 5 drama, said last month that its warm reception was because “people need gentle, decent television about people trying to care for each other and reduce suffering. Rather than excellent hard-hitting, what you might call gritty, television about terrible things happening to innocent people.” He told the Talkshire podcast: “It’s strangely revolutionary to be making a series about people trying to be kind to each other.” Alan Sepinwall, writing in Rolling Stone, said the “empathy and simplicity of All Creatures feel genuinely radical”. Season 1 began airing in the US four days after Donald Trump supporters stormed the Capitol last January. “Suddenly there was nothing I wanted to watch more than this gentle show, with its low-stakes plotting, lush scenery, adorable animals, and ensemble of fundamentally nice people …. “It is an incredible balm, and a welcome contrast … to the dumpster fire of our own reality.” Colin Callender, the show’s executive producer, said season 1 of All Creatures had been seen by small-screen adaptation of a series of novels by James Herriot, the pen name of Yorkshire vet Alf Wight, has become a surprising hit in the home of fast-paced thrillers and warring dynasties. and “it looks like we’re en route to a similar number this time round”. He added: “A combination of the pandemic and the very uncivil society that we live in the US has meant the simple values of community, friendship and kindness have got lost in a very ugly political debate. The show serves as a relief from the stresses and strains that people are feeling right now.” US audiences loved it precisely because it was a very British drama, he added. “It’s what we do brilliantly,” and its success also showed that “we don’t need to spend enormous sums of money to compete in the international marketplace”. All Creatures was “not an expensive TV series by contemporary standards”. The Great British Bake Off, rights to which were secured by Netflix in 2018, is another success with US audiences, albeit under the title of the Great British Baking Show as the term “bake-off” is trademarked by a food brand. The Repair Shop, initially aired by Netflix, now by Discovery+, has found a loyal audience through the four seasons available in the US (the UK show is on season 8). Downton Abbey, now more than a decade old, triumphed in the US, winning more Emmys than Baftas. But some scenes and backstories were cut, with an executive producer for PBS explaining that US audiences demanded a “different speed when it comes to television drama”. Mark Lawson, who writes about television for the Guardian, said the enamour felt by some US and UK audiences for the other country’s small-screen offerings was not new. But in each case, it was a minority of viewers, perhaps 15-20%. “It goes back at least to the 1960s. British viewers who find British television too cosy have craved the edge of American television, and American viewers who find American television too edgy have craved the cosiness of British TV.” The US had supplied “glossy TV”, such as Dallas and Dynasty long before anything similar was produced in the UK, while British broadcasters excelled at “heritage TV”, said Lawson, who is writing a history of television. Today, he added, “the US hits here tend to be the best of [their output], but I’m not sure that’s true reciprocally”.",Arts/Television & radio,All Creatures Great and Small gently conquers America,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/11/all-creatures-great-and-small-gently-conquers-america
1/12/2022,"Awell-meaning but hammy and perfunctorily sentimental heartwarmer in the familiar Britfilm style, inspired by the true story of Liz Evans, the dynamic founder of a youth theatre in Carmarthen whose productions were performed in an art deco theatre called the Lyric. She single-handedly saved it from demolition in the 90s, with her unflagging commitment to preserving it as a performance space, a movie theatre and a community resource. Samantha Morton plays Liz; Jonathan Pryce plays a benevolent old teacher (favourite film: Goodbye Mr Chips) and Tom Felton is a kind-hearted postman. But the movie creates a gurning comedy evil mayor who is in cahoots with wicked developers, and this thankless and somewhat broad role is taken by Adeel Akhtar, who can do little or nothing with it.  I can’t help contrasting Save the Cinema with the recent film Dream Horse: also based on the inspiring true story of a Welsh community led by a gutsy local woman getting everyone together to fight back against adversity, in that case by buying a racehorse, and in fact Owen Teale has a part in both films. But that had a kind of passion and seriousness that Save the Cinema doesn’t and there is, for me, always something a little bit misjudged about appealing to sugary nostalgia in the cause of saving a cinema. Well, there is a nice tribute to John Ford’s How Green Was My Valley: a screening at the Lyric inspires everyone present to stand up and belt out Bread of Heaven. The sentiment is sound enough.

1/12/2022,"Christopher David Lutu, 28, never thought his caring, passionate big sister would pass away from Covid at the age of just 37, weeks away from receiving her first jab. Fila Lutu had worried about getting vaccinated because she had previously suffered bad reactions to injections, but landing a new job with the NHS had persuaded her to make an appointment.  Unfortunately, it was too late. She returned to their home in Chadwell Heath from a visit to France on Sunday 12 December, and by Monday she had started coughing. On Wednesday, she tested positive, and booked a PCR test for Thursday. From there, she deteriorated quickly. On Friday, the family called an ambulance, but her condition wasn’t considered serious enough at that point. It took her collapsing on the bed from pain in her heart to be admitted to a local hospital. Overnight, her heart swelled, and in the morning she had a cardiac arrest, from which she died despite attempts at resuscitation. He brother said medical staff were uncertain whether the heart attack was a complication of Covid or the result of an underlying condition aggravated by the virus. Fila Lutu’s death is one of more than 175,000 that make up a grim milestone for the UK. The Office for National Statistics on Tuesday reported 176,035 deaths where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate since March 2020. The figure differs significantly from the government’s official count – which passed 150,000 deaths over the weekend – and uses the criterion that patients have had a positive test within the 28 days before their death. Lutu said: “It feels like she’s been snatched away from us, because she was an amazing person in the family. It’s going to leave a hole.” He recalled how growing up as the eldest sibling in a family of nine, Fila “always put the needs of other people before herself”, getting a job at Pizza Hut to support the household, and bringing back leftover pizza and chicken wings. She had planned to channel her drive and perseverance into a career as a life coach, and had recently completed a course and set up her own business. “She wanted to inspire other people to become better versions of themselves,” Lutu said. Although the family are devastated by their loss, Lutu hopes that, even after her death, Fila will still be able to help people. He is fundraising for the local hospital in her memory, and hopes that her experience will encourage others to get vaccinated as quickly as possible. “I’d say, if you’re going to get it anyway, do it as soon as possible and don’t delay it, because we don’t know if it would have changed anything.” For Taylor Syme, 20, this Christmas was supposed to be about enjoying time with family in their hometown of Falkirk. Instead, she, her three siblings and their three children spent the holidays desperately hoping that their 42-year-old mum, Kelly-Anne Syme, and their grandma, who is still in hospital, would survive their Covid infections after the entire family caught the virus in December. Syme said her mum, who was vulnerable to serious infection as she was battling two lung diseases, tested positive for coronavirus on 20 December despite rarely leaving the home other than for essential reasons. Initially, Kelly-Anne felt slightly unwell and had headaches, but by Christmas Eve she had to be taken to intensive care because she was unable to breathe. Doctors said she was so weak that if she was put on a ventilator she would never come off it, and she passed away in the early hours of 4 January. For Syme, the fact that the Omicron wave is resulting in milder infections and fewer restrictions is cold comfort. “We’re absolutely heartbroken. We were meant to be planning Christmas together. We weren’t planning on saying bye to our mum. If people had taken the lockdown seriously, Mum would still be here. [Governments] lifted it too early, opening clubs, pubs and schools. We were just fighting the inevitable,” she said. As their father died six years earlier, Kelly-Anne’s youngest daughter, who is 12, will now be cared for by her older siblings. Syme said her mum leaves behind a “close-knit family” because she “raised us very well”. Syme is raising money for her mum’s funeral to “give her the send off she deserves”. In a tribute on the fundraising page, she wrote: “She had the biggest heart and most infectious smile. She was the best mum and the best wee granny.” David Garfinkel, 49, lost his father Ivor, 76, to Covid after so-called freedom day on 19 July. In the summer, the public awaited a return to normality after more than a year of coronavirus restrictions. Nightclubs reopened, large events resumed and social distancing ended. For Garfinkel, however, what followed was “one of the worst experiences you can go through”. After catching the virus, Ivor, who had an autoimmune condition, gradually deteriorated. With the help of a family doctor, he was admitted to hospital and put on a drip. “We spoke to him briefly for the first time in weeks as he had been so tired before [that] he was in and out of consciousness and we could not get any sense out of him,” Garfinkel said. This was the last time he would speak to his dad. Within a few days, Ivor was taken to intensive care and put on a ventilator. After three days, doctors said they planned to switch the support off, but Garfinkel wasn’t allowed to say goodbye. “His body was ravaged by Covid,” he said. Ivor, who was 76, had started life working for Marks & Spencer, before setting up his own business as an importer of accessories. “He was the kind of person who would always put other people first. If someone was in need, he would be there,” Garfinkel said. The experience has been traumatic for him. “There is a state of shock and denial around what has happened. You never get a chance to forget or move on. Covid is always in the news, and you are always asking, ‘What if’, every time there is talk of a new medicine to help or vaccination booster.” He has been surprised by the selfishness of people when it comes to mask-wearing and the “incompetence of the government”. “Behind every single coronavirus death, there are family and friends. It is not just one person lost; there are lots of people left behind picking up the pieces.”",News/World news,Families on losing loved ones to Covid: ‘It feels like she’s been snatched away’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/families-on-losing-loved-ones-to-covid
1/12/2022,"Upon the announcement of Hollywood legend Sidney Poitier’s death, I sent out a tweet that featured my favorite photo of him. The photo in question shows a shirtless Poitier, wearing dark sunglasses like Miles Davis on the cover of ‘Round About Midnight, playing the saxophone alongside jazz man Sonny Stitt, while standing in the street, surrounded by a community of appreciative onlookers, otherwise known as “the people.” The reason I dig this photo so much is because it offers a more complex image of Poitier than the one that had come to define him at the height of his fame in Hollywood. I have never been able to confirm the context of this photo, but I have always assumed that it was taken while he was preparing for his role as the expatriate horn player in the film Paris Blues. Whatever the circumstances though, the image itself suggests an authenticity, a certain street credibility that is much more complex than the conveniently integrationist symbolism that his persona has so often been reduced to.  By the late 1960s Sidney Poitier was the biggest box office draw in America. With movies like In the Heat of the Night, To Sir With Love and Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, his films had become their own genre. Accomplishing this was no small feat. When Poitier began his career, most movies featuring predominately Black casts were musicals. Black men who appeared in otherwise all white films tended to be represented as inarticulate, child-like buffoons; racial clowns who scratched when they didn’t itch and laughed when nothing was funny. Poitier’s rise to the top of the Hollywood mountain changed this. He was often the lone Black person moving through hostile white spaces. His refined, erudite and dignified image was a counter to the coonery and buffoonery that figures like Stepin’ Fetchit, Mantan Moreland, Eddie “Rochester” Anderson, and Willie Best had previously represented. Like so many elite midcentury jazz musicians, Poitier wanted people to see him as an artist, not as a stereotypical entertainer. And in this he succeeded. This is my favorite photo of Sidney…shirtless, wearing shades, sheddin’ on the sax w/ Sonny Stitt while standing in the street, surrounded by the people #SidneyPoitier pic.twitter.com/ccqYjKHH7k When perhaps his most famous character, Virgil Tibbs from In the Heat of the Night, demanded that the racist southern white cops put some respect on his name, “They call me Mister Tibbs!,” Poitier was like Muhammad Ali who had demanded the same thing in the ring and in real life. In the film, the character of Endicott took offense to the fact that the “uppity” Tibbs had actually spoken to him as an equal, instead of like the fawning obsequious fool that he expected him to be. So, Endicott slaps Tibbs across the face for getting out of what he perceived to be his place. But quicker than the blink of an eye, Tibbs responded in kind, slapping the taste out of Endicott’s mouth, as it were. The “slap heard round the world” – this legendary cinematic moment when Poitier’s stardom afforded his character the opportunity to retaliate against a white man without fear of retribution – demonstrated that just because he was known for playing these proper gentlemen on screen, he could still handle his business, if need be. Poitier’s image in film has often been associated with that of Dr Martin Luther King Jr; Poitier won the Academy Award for best actor the same year that King won the Nobel Prize. But in this instance, when Tibbs slapped Endicott back, the character that he would most be associated with going forward demonstrated that there were multiple layers to his complex persona. He may have reminded some of MLK, but in the late 60s when the civil rights movement was being challenged by assertions of Black Power, Virgil Tibbs did not turn the other cheek. Here he had more in common with Malcolm X than he did with Dr King, in spite what his measured persona may have lead some people to believe. Seeing In the Heat of the Night as a kid left an indelible imprint on my adult mind. Being a distinguished gentleman did not mean accepting humiliation, literally or figuratively. Demanding that those celluloid racists respect him and showing them that he could maneuver in a variety of ways said to me that being well rounded and multidimensional, defying categorization, mixing supreme intellect with authenticity was indeed the way to go. This is what Tibbs, Poitier’s larger cinematic persona, and especially that photo of him playing the sax in his shades, surrounded by Blackness, came to stand for. Many years after I initially saw Poitier in this groundbreaking film, I had the distinct pleasure of meeting him. In the late 1990s Poitier was the commencement speaker at the USC School of Cinematic Arts where I have spent the last 30 years of my professional life. Watching him as a kid, the lone Black man navigating labyrinthine white spaces, was comparable to the occupational life I found myself living in the rarified spaces of academia. Exhibiting a gentlemanly manner coexisted alongside an understanding that not everyone agreed that I actually belonged in such an elite space. Like Virgil Tibbs, I could be diplomatic, but as that hilarious malt liquor ad from the 1980s said, “Don’t let the smooth taste fool you.” Standing on the graduation stage in full academic regalia, as I placed a PhD hood on a newly graduated doctoral candidate, thinking about how the people who created all of this higher education pomp and circumstance most certainly never imagined that a cat like me would be representing in this way, I turned around to see Poitier approaching me, with his hand extended, smiling broadly. His words, “Nice to meet you, Dr” echoed as I shook his hand. As we stood there, I absorbed the magnitude of the moment. He offered multiple compliments and pleasantries, as gracious in life as that of his persona. We shared a knowing laugh. But this was Sidney Poitier, not Virgil Tibbs. He understood what this all meant, and so did I. Things that are understood often need not be articulated. Sidney Poitier was a giant of American culture. He stands as one of the most important figures in the history of Hollywood, without question. The monumental legacy of Poitier’s style is evident in those that he influenced. Be it the career of contemporary Hollywood royalty Denzel Washington, or that of the nation’s first Black president, Barack Obama. Sidney Poitier, the distinguished gentleman of cinema was groundbreaking, inspirational, cool, complex and authentic as well. The era he represented is long gone, but the foundation he laid is one we’re still building on. Rest in power!

1/12/2022,"If there is a manager suited to the VAR era, it is $tevie Mbe. The explosive badge- and camera-kissing celebrations of his glorious playing career are long forgotten now he is a grim-faced manager with the pitchside manner of Lord Ferg confronted with a copy of Thatcher: the Downing Street Years. Perhaps conditioned by those moments when he maybe got a little bit too amped before giving the ball to Demba Ba/nobbling Ander Herrera mere seconds after coming on, he does not celebrate until the VAR lady sings.  He knew. Everyone knew. Even The Fiver knew. Somewhere amid that scrambled Aston Villa ‘equaliser’ at Old Trafford on Monday night would be a minor infringement that might rule out Danny Ings’ bundle home, and with it would go the chances of Prince William, David Cameron, Tom Hanks and Geezer Butler’s chance of their knees getting all trembly on the road to Wembley. As it turned out, the refs in the video bunker had to rewind the footage almost as far as Peter McParland’s charge on Ray Wood in the 1957 FA Cup final to rule out the goal, and it turned out an NFL-style blocking manoeuvre from Jacob Ramsey on Edinson Cavani sometime amid 1979’s Winter of Discontent had saved Manchester United’s blushes. United got lucky. Very lucky, since Big Red’s performance had been absolute bloody rubbish. Again. This time there wasn’t even an emotional return for Phil Jones to distract from just how teeth-grindingly badly United had played. Fans of their rivals may draw sweet joy from United’s continuing travails under Wreck-It Ralf Rangnick, but there’s an extra dimension to the team’s mediocrity; they are duller to watch than a documentary on the history and evolution of the micrometre screw gauge.

1/12/2022,"The risk of a hard landing for large parts of the global economy is rising as countries struggle to cope with the triple threat of Covid-19, inflation and higher interest rates, the World fBank has said. In its half-yearly forecasts, the Washington DC-based Bank said it expected a “pronounced slowdown” in growth in the next two years, with the less well-off parts of the world especially hard hit.  David Malpass, the World Bank’s president, called for action to reduce the debts of poor countries and said he was “very worried” about the permanent scarring of development caused by the pandemic. He said: “The world economy is simultaneously facing Covid-19, inflation, and policy uncertainty, with government spending and monetary policies in uncharted territory. Rising inequality and security challenges are particularly harmful for developing countries.” With the Bank predicting a slowdown in growth from 5.5% in 2021 to 4.1% this year and 3.2% in 2023, Malpass added: “Putting more countries on a favourable growth path requires concerted international action and a comprehensive set of national policy responses.” The Bank said the rapid spread of the Omicron variant suggested the pandemic was likely to continue disrupting economic activity in the near term, while a marked deceleration in the world’s two biggest economies – the US and China – would reduce exports from emerging and developing economies. “At a time when governments in many developing economies lack the policy space to support activity if needed, new Covid-19 outbreaks, persistent supply-chain bottlenecks and inflationary pressures, and elevated financial vulnerabilities in large swathes of the world could increase the risk of a hard landing,” the report said. Malpass said many countries were already facing an education “hard landing”, pointing out that in poor countries the number of 10-year-olds unable to read a simple text had risen from 53% to 70% in the past two years. “Deep debt relief is needed,” Malpass said. “If we wait too long it will be too late and it won’t be successful.” The Bank said growth in advanced economies was expected to decline from 5% in 2021 to 3.8% in 2022 and 2.3% in 2023 – a pace of expansion that would still be enough to restore output and investment to their pre-pandemic trend. By the end of next year, all advanced economies were expected to have achieved a full recovery in output. Growth in emerging and developing economies was expected to drop from 6.3% in 2021 to 4.6% in 2022 and 4.4% in 2023, leaving output 4% below its pre-pandemic trend. For fragile and conflict-affected countries, output would be 7.5% below its pre-pandemic trend, while in small island states it would be 8.5% below. The Bank said rising inflation – which hits low-income workers particularly hard – was constraining monetary policy. “Globally and in advanced economies, inflation is running at the highest rates since 2008. In emerging market and developing economies, it has reached its highest rate since 2011. Many emerging and developing economies are withdrawing policy support to contain inflationary pressures – well before the recovery is complete.” At a time when immunisation rates in the world’s poorest countries are below 10%, the World Bank said the immediate priority was to ensure vaccines were deployed more widely. But it said there was also the need for long-term support to tackle setbacks in development progress, such as rising inequality. “In a time of high debt, global cooperation will be essential to help expand the financial resources of developing economies so they can achieve green, resilient, and inclusive development,” said Mari Pangestu, the Bank’s managing director for development policy and partnerships.",News/Business,"Developing countries at risk from global economic threats, says World Bank",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/11/developing-countries-at-risk-from-global-economic-threats-says-world-bank

1/12/2022,"Silvio Berlusconi has reportedly threatened to withdraw his Forza Italia party from Italy’s governing majority if the current prime minister, Mario Draghi, is elected president later this month. The scandal-tainted media tycoon, who served four times as prime minister, is in Rome from Tuesday on the hunt for votes as he ramps up his own presidential campaign.  The secret ballot by more than 1,000 parliamentarians and regional representatives begins on 24 January and is expected to go through several rounds before a successor to Sergio Mattarella, who steps down on 3 February, is elected. There are no official candidates in Italy’s presidential elections, although party leaders usually try to agree on a candidate. Berlusconi, 85, is a favourite among the rightwing parties for the seven-year-mandate. However, Draghi, who is credited with restoring stability in Italy, as well as keeping the broad coalition in line, is tipped as the frontrunner. According to reports in the Italian press, Berlusconi said that without Draghi as prime minister, “Forza Italia would leave the majority”. Draghi’s potential promotion risks bringing general elections forward by a year. In a poll released on Tuesday, more than 50% of Italians said Draghi was the person most fit for the job, while 39% supported Berlusconi. Berlusconi, who was temporarily banned from public office after a tax fraud conviction in 2013 and is still being tried for allegedly bribing witnesses in an underage prostitution case connected to his notorious “bunga bunga” sex parties, has reportedly been bombarding parliamentarians in the lead-up to the ballot in what the Italian press has described as his “Operation Squirrel campaign”. Antonio Tajani, the deputy Forza Italia leader, said Draghi needed to remain prime minister and that with Berlusconi as president, “the government would be solid”. Draghi hinted in December he would be prepared to accept the role if elected. However, he began a press conference on Monday night by vetoing questions about the presidential race. “Only Draghi can do this [prime minister] job,” Tajani told La Stampa. “Without Draghi it’s impossible to have a unity government … we’re participating in this government because of Draghi.” Tajani said Forza Italia’s withdrawal from government would be inevitable if Draghi moved to the presidential palace. “The majority would implode,” he said. Italy’s president has a largely ceremonial role, albeit with the power to resolve political crises, pick prime ministers and call early elections. Mattarella was forced to step several times to resolve crises, including calling on Draghi to form a unity government last February after the administration led by Giuseppe Conte collapsed. Analysts believe Berlusconi will struggle to garner enough support for his bid, even if he is noted for his shrewd “vote-buying skills”. On the eve of his campaign, he posted a photo of himself and his girlfriend, Marta Fascina, a Forza Italia politician, on Instagram, alongside the message: “Happy birthday.” Fascina turned 32 on Sunday.",News/World news,Silvio Berlusconi steps up Italy presidential campaign with threat to coalition ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/silvio-berlusconi-steps-up-presidential-campaign-threat-italy-coalition
