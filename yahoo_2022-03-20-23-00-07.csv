3/20/2022,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Patriot air defence system has started arriving in Slovakia from NATO partner countries and the deployment will continue in the coming days, Slovakia's defence minister said on Sunday. The system will be operated by German and Dutch troops and will initially be deployed at the Sliac airport in central Slovakia to help reinforce the defence of NATO's eastern flank. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted the alliance to bolster its defences. The Patriot system will be part of a new NATO battlegroup in Slovakia, which neighbours Ukraine. ""I am happy to confirm that the first units in charge of deploying the Patriot air defence system are gradually arriving to Slovakia,"" Defence Minister Jaroslav Nad said on Facebook. Nad said the Patriot system will be a complement and not a replacement of the Soviet-era S-300 system that Slovakia operates. ""Temporarily, the system will be deployed at the Sliac air force base, further deployment areas are being consulted ... so that the security umbrella covers the largest possible part of Slovak territory,"" Nad said. The minister said last week that Slovakia is willing to give the S-300 to Ukraine if and when it gets a proper replacement. He reiterated on Sunday that Slovakia was looking for its own replacement of S-300 due to its age, capabilities and dependence on Russia. Russia has warned against any shipments of advanced air defences to Ukraine and has warned it may target Western arms supplies.

3/20/2022,"During a pro-war rally in Moscow on Friday night, Russian President Vladimir Putin invoked the words of Jesus Christ in order to justify his invasion of Ukraine. Moscow police said more than 200,000 people attended the rally, Al Jazeera reported. Polling shows that a majority of Russians support the war in Ukraine, which has already left numerous Ukrainian civilians displaced, injured, and dead. Speaking to the crowd in a turtleneck and down winter coat, Putin said he ordered the invasion ""to get people out of their misery, out of this genocide, that is the main reason, the motive and purpose of the military operation that we began in Donbas and Ukraine,"" according to The Washington Post. Russia has repeatedly accused the Ukrainian government of committing genocide in separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine. ""And this is where the words from the Scriptures come to my mind: 'There is no greater love than if someone gives his soul for his friends,'"" Putin continued, paraphrasing John 15:13. Both the Post and ABC News translate the Russian word душу (dushu) as ""soul,"" but most English translations of the passage use ""life."" The verse is part of a long discourse Jesus delivered to his disciples as they traveled to the Garden of Gethsemane, where he was arrested and taken to be crucified after ordering Simon Peter not to use force to defend him. Putin identifies as a Russian Orthodox Christian but has expressed discomfort with speaking publicly about his faith.

A Chinese company is developing a supersonic jet capable of traveling from New York to China in just one hour (via Robb Report). The company behind the jet is Space Transportation. It says that it is developing a “rocket with wings”, which will work for space tourism and point-to-point travel.

Amazon's #1 best-selling bed pillows with 118,000 5-star reviews have a rare discount today You won't believe how good the Amazon deals are on this special page! Space Transportation says that its jet will be lower cost than the rockets that are used to carry satellites into space. It will also be much faster than traditional planes. To showcase the speed it hopes to achieve, Space Transportation has included a video on its website. In the video, several passengers climb aboard the supersonic jet. The jet then turns vertically towards the sky and launches into the air. After several seconds of flight, the launch boosters fall away, returning safely to the launch pad where they can be used again later. The jet then continues its trek through the clouds and its suborbital journey, eventually traveling 7,000KM to its destination in the span of 60 minutes. The craft shown in the video is impressive, and the speed at which it travels is even more impressive. Space Transport plans to run ground tests by 2023. It hopes to commence a first flight of the supersonic jet in 2024, and a crewed flight later in 2025. These plans are ambitious, but the company isn’t stopping there. It also says that it hopes to run a test flight of a crewed space vehicle by 2030. Space tourism has become a hot topic as of late. Especially after NASA shared hopes that space would open to more people by 2030 when it announced its plan to crash the ISS earlier this year. So it isn’t that surprising to see Space Transportation jumping on board and working towards a supersonic jet. Other companies like Virgin Galactic have already conducted fully crewed suborbital flights in the past. Elon Musk’s SpaceX also shared plans previously to create a suborbital flight system. SpaceX hasn’t talked about those plans anymore, though, so we’re unsure if it would work similarly to the supersonic jet that Space Transportation is working on, or if SpaceX might take a different approach. All in all, the future of space tourism, and space transport itself is something we can expect to see a lot of companies striving for. With plenty of big companies pushing for the future of travel, we should lack options when it comes to supersonic jets capable of taking us around the world at unbelievable speeds.
