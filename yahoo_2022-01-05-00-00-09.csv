1/5/2022,"Dallas Cowboys NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman is ready to take on Big Beer names such as Budweiser and MolsonCoors with the same intensity as he did long-time rivals the New York Giants on a Sunday primetime matchup.  Well sort of, but you get the point.  Aikman, 55, revealed Tuesday he will be launching EIGHT beer after two years of developing the product along with award-winning brewmaster and beer industry veteran Phil Leinhart. Billed as suds for the modern beer drinker — in this case meaning it's made from organic grains, has no sugar and features ""antioxidant-rich"" Hallertau Taurus hops — EIGHT will debut first at bars and restaurants in Aikman's home field of Texas. Come March, EIGHT will find its way onto retail shelves in the Lone Star state.  The Cowboys great — who is known for making savvy investments in car dealerships and restaurant chain WingStop —tells Yahoo Finance he has long enjoyed beer, but it's time for something better, ingredient wise, for those with active lifestyles (like the jacked energetic Aikman, who has been hosting NFL games on Fox NFL ""A Team"" since 2002).  ""There's over 1,000 breweries across America and the space that we've entered is as competitive as any of them. I've always been a beer drinker. I love beer. And when I looked at the category, I just felt that it could be better. I thought that what's available has been on the market for a long time. I think it was time for a newcomer and quite simply, I felt that we could do it better and I think that we have. So that was really the motivation behind getting behind this project,"" the three-time Super Bowl winner told Yahoo Finance. Aikman's ""better beer"" appears to be hitting the market at the right moment in time.  According to a new survey of retailers from Uber-owned alcohol delivery service Drizly, 60% say “organic and natural” are non-price-related attributes that is increasingly influencing their purchasing decisions, especially for wine. Moreover, while half of the retailers surveyed plan to carry more hard seltzer next year, 57% expect to devote more shelf space to craft beer.  Added Aikman, ""There's a lot of people like me that are very conscious of what they're putting into their bodies. They work hard during the week, and when it comes time to celebrate, don't want to compromise all the hard work that they put in throughout the week.""

1/5/2022,"“Sometimes a rapid-fire could burn through very quickly,” says Dr. David Ho of the omicron variant, “but then put itself out.” The high-transmission rate of the omicron variant of COVID-19 could potentially mean that as it rips its way through the U.S. population leaving antibodies in its wake, herd immunity may actually be possible. In a recent CNBC report, Dr. David Ho, a world-renowned virologist, posited that “Sometimes a rapid-fire could burn through very quickly but then put itself out.” Dr. Ho, a Columbia University professor, said his theory is a speculative one, but it is agreed upon by other experts. Dr. Bruce Farber, Northwell Health’s chief of infectious diseases, said the “best-case scenario” of the coronavirus would be a highly contagious variant that doesn’t make most people particularly sick and creates a temporary baseline of immunity. “It could certainly help end large spikes of deadly Covid with high hospitalizations,” he added. In another interview, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases contended, per The New York Times, that the country’s focus should pivot away from case count numbers to the severity of cases. “As you get further on and the infections become less severe,” he said, “it is much more relevant to focus on the hospitalizations as opposed to the total number of cases.” Despite being highly contagious, the omicron variant seems to cause less hospitalization and death —particularly among the vaccinated. The article notes that 62% of the U.S. population have received some form of a vaccine, but only 30% have received a booster shot, which improves protection. Omicron is responsible for as many as 73% of COVID cases in the country. Just before Christmas, as cases were exploding, Dr. Fauci said in an appearance on Good Morning America that omicron is “truly unprecedented in the rapidity at which it spreads.” While the idea of the coronavirus pandemic ending is promising, allowing the world to return to some semblance of normal life, scientists also warn that it is highly unlikely that COVID will ever disappear completely. “This virus is so well adapted for human-to-human transmission that it’s never going to away,” Dr. Timothy Brewer says. “There will be periods when there will be more cases and [fewer] cases, just like it occurs with influenza every year.” Eventually, disease authorities maintain, the coronavirus will weaken, and regular vaccination and continued anti-viral treatments, combined with immunity, will likely lessen its severity in the years that follow.

1/5/2022,"When Chengdu resident Tian Hao, 45, visits his neighborhood supermarket, he stays away from the best-looking fruit and vegetables. ""If they are big or beautiful, they're not normal. If they have no holes or marks on them or their roots, we avoid them,"" he told Insider. ""Sometimes, the vegetables they put on display still have pesticides and chemicals on them. It takes an experienced eye to know what you can buy there."" His distrust of commercial produce, like that of millions of people in China, can be traced back to a single event in 2008. That year, China discovered that local milk products for babies had been laced with melamine, an industrial chemical used in plastics and fertilizers. Nearly 300,000 infants fell ill after consuming the contaminated milk, and at least 50 of them died from kidney stones. Beijing responded to the tragedy with life imprisonment for several milk executives, forced resignations of seven municipal officials, and the executions of a dairy farmer and a milk salesman. As China's middle class continues to grow at an astonishing rate — in 2000, only 3% of the country was considered middle class, where now nearly 50% of the population falls into a middle-class income bracket — so has its concern around food quality. Especially as a deluge of food scandals continue to roil the country. While state media has debunked photoshopped images of chickens with six wings and eight legs, China's middle class still has reason to be skeptical. Scandals – including hawkers mixing raw sewage with waste fat from slaughterhouses to sell as cooking oil, and reports that some boba tea pearls had been made from leather and rubber bits – leave a bad taste in many mouths. The regular onslaught of food safety issues means that even 13 years after the milk scandal, many Chinese limit themselves to buying just a few vegetables and rice at the supermarket. Tian, who works at a social agency, said he rarely visits his local grocery store these days. He's one of the thousands across China who now orders produce directly from small-time rural farmers while trying their best to avoid the dubious national supply chain. Every week, boxes and baskets arrive at Tian's apartment laden with supplies, including whole plucked chickens, eggs, tomatoes, cucumbers, sweet potatoes, or lentils, all grown or reared in villages just a few hours outside the city. Buying direct is more expensive than shopping at traditional wet markets or supermarkets. Where a market chicken in Chengdu typically costs around $8, one farmer charges Tian up to $28 for a chicken. But he feels the expense is worth it, especially when it comes to providing for his 13-year-old daughter. ""When she was born, I started paying attention to what we're eating,"" he said. ""Quality of our food is a big concern for the middle class in China, especially if you have a family. Everyone in every city worries about this, whether you are in Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, or Chengdu."" Even brand-name goods sold in China's grocery stores are often not what they seem; knock-off and counterfeit products are ubiquitous. From May to November 2020, for example, China recorded more than 1,400 instances of counterfeit products sold in markets. ""Purchasing food with trusted brand names does not offer complete assurance when consumers cannot be certain of the veracity of the brand label,"" Gregory Veeck, a professor at Western Michigan University, wrote in a 2020 paper. ""Likewise, labels such as 'green,' 'local,' or 'organic' lose power when consumers cannot be sure that the product has been grown and processed as promoted.""That's why ad hoc agreements with farmers have become increasingly popular, said Dr. Si Zhenzhong, a researcher at the Wilfrid Laurier University in Canada whose work focuses on food and agriculture in China. The milk scandal may have been more than a decade ago, but Si said that when his research team surveyed 1,210 households in Nanjing, China, in 2015, 74% said they still worried daily about food safety. Si estimates there are more than 500 village farms in China delivering their produce to consumers' doorsteps, though the figure may actually be closer to a thousand. ""Consumers started organizing themselves and sourcing food from farmers they felt they could trust,"" said Si, who's also a co-investigator for Hungry Cities Partnership, a network of organizations assessing urban food safety in countries including China. Part of that trust comes from the fact that many Chinese people in the city are closely related to farmers through friends or family. ""A lot of Chinese urban people still have relatives in the countryside. In four decades, China tripled its urbanization rate from 20% to 61%. The US spent 100 years reaching that increase,"" said Si. Zhao Ping, 47, who works in hotel management, used to get his pork through a pig farmer who's a distant relative of his wife. He and seven friends would make the two-hour drive every few months to the rural town of Le Shan and visit the farm. A few days before the Chinese Lunar New Year, they'd usually each buy one pig — about a year's meat supply for Zhao's family of four — at around $3.60 per pound. The arrangement gave him almost total control over the pig's rearing. ""We would go there every few months and observe the pigs. They let us choose what the pigs eat. If we want them to eat better feed and it is more expensive, we'll pay a little extra for it,"" he told Insider. But then, in 2019, a particularly virulent strain of African swine flu wiped out the farmer's entire hog supply, said Zhao. His family switched from pork to poultry and now buys chickens through a farmer he found online. He pays the farmer a deposit of $300 a year, and in return, gets to pick several hens from the village flock every month at around $11.50 a bird. ""I don't mind buying eggs from the supermarket, but not chicken,"" said Zhao, who said he's concerned about industrial farms potentially feeding or injecting their flocks with chemicals. Tian and Zhao both recognize their grocery habits require one critical resource: money. ""I think many people have concerns, but many don't have a choice. If we want to eat safer, we have to pay more,"" said Tian, who spends 40% of his income on food for his family. In comparison, most Chinese urban consumers allocate around 20% of their spending on dining out and essential food ingredients, according to a 2020 report by management consulting firm McKinsey. For most Chinese people, the big solution for their food safety concerns is to do nothing about it, said Dr. Anders Hansen, a social anthropologist from Aarhus University in Denmark who researches food supplies and culture in modern China. ""It's not much of a strategy at all, but it's like closing your eyes and saying: 'I know this problem's there, but I can't do anything about that at all,"" said Hansen, who spent months researching and living on small farms in northern China that sell food to cities. ""Most people cannot afford to up their food safety. They don't have the time for it because it's very time-consuming to be a food safety-wise consumer,"" he added. In fact, many farmers and industrial farms overuse pesticides to protect their crop yields because they can't afford not to, said Hansen. China leads the world in pesticides for agriculture and uses at least four times more than the US despite having 38 million hectares less farmland. China is also the world's largest consumer of antibiotics in agricultural production, according to the Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return Initiative. Experts say the overuse of antibiotics encourages the development of antibiotic-resistant superbugs. ""We have to feed so many people in China. If you let the pigs and chickens and vegetables grow naturally, it will take a long time and cost a lot,"" Tian said. Chinese authorities have tried allaying the public's fears by revamping food safety laws and introducing QR codes on products to let customers track their food. ""World Consumer Rights Day,"" an annual nationwide televised event on March 15, involves naming and shaming foreign and domestic brands who have engaged in poor business practices, including food safety violations. These measures have given more ""teeth"" to food safety governance, but the government still has a long way to go, said Si. Beijing is keen to implement a nationwide food traceability system, but China's food supply chain is simply too massive to keep an eye on everything. ""There are many factors involved in the current food supply chain. It sources food from multiple small [farms] and goes through a long supply chain of wholesalers and dealers and brokers,"" he said. Then there's the disconnect between what's signed on paper and how measures are carried out on the ground. Si recalled local governments in places like Nanjing providing wet market employees with equipment to test for chemical residue in vegetables. But the staff never received the training to use the devices properly, said Si. He and Hansen believe the government should double down on making the supply chain more transparent and look at how small farms have built personal networks and relationships with their customers. ""The buyers trust the producers because they know them. There's this whole issue of trust that needs more attention,"" said Si. ""The government really needs to test this whole system in a way that can foster public trust."" But right now, said Hansen: ""The Chinese state government's approach to food safety has nothing to do with trust. It's based on control. It's based on knowledge.""

1/5/2022,"To the editor: After not quite 30 years in Nashville — which your recent article described as a major destination for people leaving California — my wife and I were asked by her aging parents to move back to her hometown of Pasadena in 2000. We were more than ready. Although we had a nice house in a lively, activist neighborhood, the stubborn refusal of the body politic to enact much-needed tax reforms, such as instituting an income tax and removing the nearly 10% or so sales tax on goods and services (including non-prescription drugs and the lower rate on groceries), as well as the increasingly conservative drift in the state's politics, had already begun stalling the drift toward more enlightened governance. We go back to visit every other year or so. We were there in November, enjoying time with friends and family, but not very much of Nashville itself. The 12 South area, where I once had a house and remember as an up-and-coming neighborhood, is now packed with young bar hoppers. Only the stunning new National Museum of African American Music redeemed downtown for us. A very wise person once said, ""Taxes are the rent you pay for where you want to live."" I agree with that, only modifying it to ""the kinds of taxes."" Will Owen, Pasadena .. To the editor: Todd Hood says he moved his brewery from California to Nashville in part because he values Tennessee's limited government. ""Any way that California can screw you they will,"" he says. It's true that Hood can now legally pay his employees just $7.25 an hour. And housing is of course cheaper. But otherwise, I wonder if Hood did his homework. The excise tax on his own product is 20 cents per gallon in California but $1.29 in Tennessee, the highest rate in the nation. And did Hood know about his new state's 15% liquor-by-the-drink tax? Tennessee's combined state and average local sales tax rate is 9.54%, the highest in the U.S. And the state taxes groceries. In 2020, the year Hood moved his brewery to Nashville, city homeowners sustained a 34% tax hike (the state is one of only four with no limit on property tax increases). That doesn't sound like limited government to me. Brad Bonhall, Reno .. To the editor: When I was in college in Indiana, we rushed through the South to get to Florida for spring break. There was nothing to stop for, except cheap cigarettes. Now Californians are leaving here for a cheap house there? The beach and the 405 Freeway still seem pretty crowded to me, so I say to these wannabe Southerners, ""Vaya con Dios.""
