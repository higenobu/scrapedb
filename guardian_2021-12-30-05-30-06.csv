12/30/2021,"Joe Biden will speak on Thursday with Vladimir Putin regarding the Russian leader’s increased security demands in eastern Europe. The two leaders will discuss a range of topics, including “upcoming diplomatic engagements in Russia”, said US national security council spokesperson Emily Horne in a statement announcing the call.  Thursday’s talks will come amid Russia’s increased security presence near Ukraine as the US and its allies watch on warily. The buildup of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border has grown to an estimated 100,000 and has fueled fears that Moscow is preparing to invade Ukraine. On Wednesday, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, spoke with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. According to state department spokesman Ned Price, Blinken “reiterated the United States’ unwavering support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia’s military buildup on Ukraine’s borders”. Earlier this month, Biden and Putin held a virtual summit regarding the Ukraine crisis but made little apparent headway. “The discussion between President Biden and President Putin was direct and straightforward. There was a lot of give and take, there was no finger-wagging. But the president was crystal clear about where the United Stated stands on all these issues,” said the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. During those talks, Putin demanded “reliable, legal guarantees” that would prevent Nato’s expansion towards Russia or place missile systems in Russia’s bordering countries. Shortly after the talks, Russia put forward a list of highly contentious security guarantees it says it wants the west to agree to in order to reduce tensions in Europe and defuse the crisis over Ukraine. The demands include a ban on Ukraine from entering Nato and limiting troop deployment and weapons to Nato’s eastern flank. Russia has also asked Nato to not hold drills without previous agreement from Russia in Ukraine, eastern Europe, in Caucasus countries or in Central Asia. Moscow has said that ignoring its interests will result in a “military response” similar to the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. On Sunday, Putin said he would consider a slew of options if the west fails to meet his push for security guarantees precluding Nato’s expansion to Ukraine. In Wednesday’s statement, Horne said: “President Biden has spoken with leaders across Europe, and Biden administration officials have engaged multilaterally with Nato, the EU and the OSCE [Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]. “The Biden administration continues to engage in extensive diplomacy with our European allies and partners, consulting and coordinating on a common approach in response to Russia’s military build-up on the border with Ukraine.”",News/US news,Biden to speak with Putin amid Russia’s increased presence near Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/29/joe-biden-vladimir-putin-talks-russia-ukraine
12/30/2021,"Chris Silverwood is taking the positives. Chris Silverwood was expecting this. Chris Silverwood has found, squinting through his Victorian eyeglass, something to build on here. Watching Silverwood’s deeply weird performance in front of the cameras at the end of the third Ashes Test in Melbourne – batting away concerns, wincing in the sun, and wearing throughout the pitying smile of a man who knows that all of this is simply another stage in the vast, unknowable masterplan of Chris Silverwood – it was hard not to worry a little about England’s head coach; to search in vain for the line between nightmarishly bad media training and a man so embedded within the blue Lycra bubble he really has lost sight of the disaster unfolding around him.  There is little to be gained from dwelling on Silverwood’s own fate at the end of this series. He is now that familiar thing, a coach who has failed to manage the details, who is clearly out of his depth, and whose dismissal will, in the classic footballing style, provide a useful straw man, patsy and general distraction from the more profound failings of those above him in the hierarchy. Still, watching Silverwood reel off his own game and biddable version of the ECB blame-avoidance handbook, it was hard not to feel a familiar sense of dissolution, of something deathly that has now found a concrete form in this southern Ashes series. The usual factors in England Ashes defeats are all reassuringly present: poor preparation, poor conditioning, the fact that Australia are demonstrably better at cricket. But there is something else here too, a quality present in so many parts of British public life, something we might call Johnsonian dissonance. Welcome, England cricket, to a place where no one is ever really accountable, where that thing you like, that difficult, unprofitable thing, is being taken away, run down and sold off right in front of your eyes by a cartel of bonus-hungry executives. Where nothing is really true, anything is possible, where Chris Silverwood really is taking the positives, and where the overwhelming reaction seems to be a kind of weary fatalism. This is the most disturbing aspect to England’s Ashes disintegration, the shared conviction that this is simply a structural inevitability, born out of irresistible macro-forces. We know the exculpatory arguments by now. The dying off of Test cricket around the world, something the England and Wales Cricket Board is apparently bound not to resist or fight against but simply to accept. The basic weirdness of a sport where you stand around doing nothing most of the time, where you can’t see the ball, an idea that frankly wouldn’t get past the first TV pitch stage these days. Not to mention the line pushed by the marketeers of the ECB that people are basically shallow and need to be given shallow things, that children can’t concentrate and only like noise and light and simple stuff. So much of this seems to have been accepted as true that England’s on-field disintegration has come to feel like a referendum on the viability of red-ball cricket itself: evidence, finally, that a death foretold for most of the past 120 years has finally come to pass. In reality the more useful reaction here is not fatalism, but resistance. Because none of this inevitable. Test cricket has always been an awkward thing, one of those objects, like poetry, or libraries, or the stubbornly over‑engineered Saab convertible, that defies the logic of the market simply by existing. It might have died after the war but for the indulgence of the state broadcaster. It might have died many times over in the decades since but for the fact people like and indeed love its difficult, unmonetised complexities. Even now, at a time when red‑ball cricket has been allowed to enter a period of managed decline, like a post‑industrial northern city in the hands of the Thatcher government, it is possible to resist this process, to make different decisions, to protect things that have value. The most immediate point is that there must be accountability or the gig is frankly up. Joe Root is a brilliant batsman and a popular presence in the cricket media. But the idea that he should remain England captain because there is no other immediate candidate capable of doing a similarly regulation job is terribly destructive. Elite sport needs sharp edges. And there are already so many points of vagueness here. Why did England talk for two years about the Ashes and yet arrive without any real coherent plan? Why did they pick weird, unbalanced teams? Just because there are systemic problems doesn’t mean it’s not possible to be a good coach. Just because the County Championship has been degraded to the extent nobody, not even the players themselves, really knows the red-ball capacities of the current generation, doesn’t mean you can’t also be a competent captain. And while we’re at it the notion of accountability must extend upwards – if not to the ECB’s chief executive Tom Harrison (which it should), then to the largely invisible Ashley Giles whose qualifications to be “managing director” of anything have not been made any clearer by his time in charge of England men’s cricket. At which point we might actually be starting to get somewhere. For all the blurring of lines, it isn’t hard to draw the arrows here. The insipid state of England Test cricket in 2021-22, the competitive death of England’s most lucrative series, the progressive strangling of the real golden goose: all of this lies at the door of the ECB. Why are England so poor at Test cricket? Because the talent pool is tiny, because this thing is essentially invisible outside of the pre-converted and those who can pay. The poverty of England’s red-ball team comes from exactly the same place as the revelations of institutional racism that drew such deeply unconvincing gasps of surprise from the chief executive once public pressure demanded some kind of response. The ECB has overseen this decline in reach, knowingly and in plain sight, registering no sense of duty to anything other than profit and loss during the quarter century of its existence. This is a governing body that has awarded its own executive a £2.1m bonus for “promoting” the sport, while simultaneously allowing the shared national treasure that is Test cricket to wither in the ground, a scandal that should on its own demand another visit to the DCMS committee. Little wonder at the end of all this we have that feeling of disintegration. This is an old England team. Root, Ben Stokes, Jimmy Anderson, Stuart Broad, Jonny Bairstow, Jack Leach, Chris Woakes, Rory Burns, Dawid Malan, Jos Buttler and Mark Wood are unlikely to come this way again. At another time this might feel like a source of excitement, the chance to renew and refresh. Given a proper domestic season, and the will to fund, resource and promote even those things that don’t bring instant profit but which are very obviously the heart of this beloved, oddly enduring old sporting culture, it could still be again.",Sport/Sport,"Hope can rise from this Ashes debacle, if the ECB stops choking the golden goose | Barney Ronay",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/29/ashes-england-cricket-ecb-joe-root-chris-silverwood
12/30/2021,"My brother Rajeve Mahandru, who has died aged 49, was a mental health worker for more than 10 years in London. He took his own life having experienced depression and mental health issues himself for more than five years. He found it difficult to take the help that was offered to him. Rajeve was born in Birmingham, to immigrant parents from the Chandigarh region of northern India, Raj ( nee Kohlei ), a former teacher, and Mohan Mahandru, a shopkeeper. Bobby was his nickname in Birmingham and for the last 20 years, living in Little Dunmow, Essex, he was known as Raj.  My brother would light up the room as soon as he entered. Smiling and laughing, he was always the joker. He was educated at City Road school and George Dixon school in Birmingham. He had a happy childhood – our family worked together to run the convenience food store. It was a community shop, where we would work, eat and talk as if it was our living room. After leaving school Rajeve spent a few months on summer camps in the US, and spent time road building in the US. He recalled that time to us as one of the best of his life. I remember the time he ran out of money and rang Mum to send him some money so he could come back home – he had no worries in the world. After the US trip he moved to London to do a mental health nursing course. He fell in love with Fiona, from Co Sligo in north-west Ireland, while they were both studying at South Bank University and they married in 2001. They had two children, Rian and Ava. Rajeve worked as a community mental health nurse in Walthamstow, east London, travelling in from their home in Essex. Tragedy struck our family when our mum and dad both died in a car accident while coming back from a funeral in 2004 in Chandigarh, where they were living in semi-retirement. When his father-in-law died of a heart attack five years ago, Rajeve went further into himself with depression and mental health problems, and retired from his job. He and Fiona separated. He is survived by Fiona, Rian and Ava, and by our younger sister, Manjo, and me.",News/Society,Rajeve Mahandru obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/29/rajeve-mahandru-obituary
12/30/2021,"My friend Jean Bell, who has died aged 62, was an artist and craftswoman and a much-loved founding member of the L’Arche community in south London, where 100 people with and without learning disabilities share life together. Jean was born in Lambeth, south London, to Gladys (nee McLean), a housewife, and Harold Bell, a builder. Her parents had moved to Britain from Jamaica; she was their sixth child and the first to be born in the UK, although there were to be three more girls after her. Jean lived with her family as a baby but, having Down’s syndrome, was placed in care as a young child – such was the way of things for many families in the 1950s.  She lived first at the Fountain hospital in Tooting, south London, where she became friends with another little girl, Michelle Antia, who would be her companion for the rest of her life. When they were older they moved together to the hospital’s annexe, South Side in nearby Streatham. By 1977, thinking about people with learning disabilities was changing, and L’Arche in London was begun. Jean moved in, along with Michelle, and her family were very involved in the move, as they had always wanted the best for her and remained close to her throughout her life. Jean was then in her late teens, shy at first but full of exuberant, youthful energy. She learned to cook – sausages a favourite – and to take the 2B bus to the Brixton Adult Training Centre, where she did artwork and knitting, subcontracted packing work, and particularly enjoyed the Friday afternoon disco. In 1979 the L’Arche workshops were opened and Jean became a highly skilled rugmaker, stoneworker and candlemaker. Her colourful artwork was used for rug designs and greetings cards, and she had several exhibitions of her work, including at Brockwell gallery in Herne Hill and at West Norwood library. She was the best of workmates and encouraged all her colleagues, making close friendships with many of them as well as the people she lived with. When I arrived in L’Arche London in 1989, she was very welcoming; I lived there until I retired five years ago, and I remain a community member. Jean did not find change and transition easy, but she overcame these challenges and travelled widely. She visited Uganda twice, and loved being a volunteer teacher for children with learning disabilities there. In Malaysia she attended the wedding of one of her many friends, and in Malta her knitting on the beach was even mentioned on local radio. Jean continued to live in the L’Arche community until 2020. Michelle had died in 2019, and Jean’s own failing health required a move to a specialist care home in Streatham the following year. She is survived by seven siblings, Johnathan, Hurvin, Veronica, Mavis, Vicky, Mbeke and Michelle.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Jean Bell obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/29/jean-bell-obituary
12/30/2021,"A Spanish association has called for an investigation into the enduring legacy of censorship during the Franco regime after it emerged that censored versions of books and films are still circulating more than four decades after the dictator died. Emilio Silva, the president of Spain’s Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory, sounded the alarm earlier this week after he stumbled upon a different version of the 1946 film It’s a Wonderful Life on television.  “All of a sudden I heard something I had never heard before,” said Silva. “It was a scene that was not in the version that I had seen 10 times before.” He swiftly realised that the Spanish TV channel where he had often watched the film still had a censored version in its catalogue. Clocking in at seven minutes shorter than the original, it omits several scenes that mention a housing co-op. He wasn’t surprised. “During the Franco era, anything that sounded like a cooperative was considered almost pro-communist,” he said. But what shocked him was that the expurgated version of the Frank Capra film was still on offer in Spain, suggesting Franco-era censorship was still alive and well in the country. “Some 45 years since the death of Franco, nobody – not even the ministry of culture – said let’s see what was censored during the regime and we’re going to fix this.” During Franco’s 36 years in power, the state’s scissors were systematic and exacting, cropping out references to the Spanish civil war and the dictatorship, along with sexually explicit material and any mention that countered the strict Catholic values promoted by the state. In Ernest Hemingway’s Across the River and Into the Trees, the use of “lesbians” was replaced with “good friends”, while references to birth control were struck from James Baldwin’s Go Tell It on the Mountain. Few works were spared, with censors taking aim at everything from musicals to magazines. This week, Silva’s organisation called on Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s Socialist prime minister, to direct the ministry of culture to undertake an investigation aimed at determining the full extent of the censorship and, following that, restoring the original versions of the censored works. The association’s demand highlights a glaring void in Spain’s transition to democracy: while the laws supporting censorship were repealed, there was no body tasked with halting the spread of censored content. Silva drew a parallel between the unabated spread of these works, some of which distort people’s perception of the civil war and its consequences, and his association’s long-running push to rid Spain of statues and other public symbols that glorify the regime. “We can say that James Baldwin, Ernest Hemingway or Frank Capra are also victims of the dictatorship, because somebody censored their works and not one democratic government in Spain has repaired this damage.” A lot of what is known about the censored works in circulation today comes from the years of research by Jordi Cornellà-Detrell, a lecturer in Hispanic studies at Glasgow University. “We are talking about one of the most long-lasting yet invisible legacies of [Franco’s] regime,” said Cornellà-Detrell. He has catalogued dozens of examples. More than 20 different Spanish-language editions of Ira Levin’s Rosemary’s Baby, including one e-book, are based on a censored version that cuts out passages deemed to glorify Satan. In the case of George Orwell’s Burmese Days and Ian Fleming’s Thunderball, censored versions continue to be published even after new translations of both works. More than 90% of the copies of William Faulkner’s Soldiers’ Pay on loan at Spain’s public libraries are censored. The reach of the censors is not limited to Spain. A publisher in Argentina last year released a censored edition of Soldiers’ Pay, hinting that works censored by Franco’s regime are also making their way to Latin America. Often the publishers are not aware that the works are censored, said Cornellà-Detrell. “There’s an ethical issue here as the words of these authors have been manipulated against their will, they don’t even know in most cases what has been done to their work.”",News/World news,Books and films censored under Franco still circulating in Spain,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/books-and-films-censored-under-franco-still-circulating-in-spain
12/30/2021,"Boris Johnson has been accused of presiding over a “total shambles” as millions of people struggle to access Covid tests after a huge surge in demand, leaving essential staff unable to work. The prime minister had urged people to take precautionary rapid Covid tests before heading out for New Year’s Eve, while the Omicron wave has pushed up demand for both lateral flows and PCRs. There were a record 183,000 positive cases confirmed on Wednesday, although this data included some delayed results.  With the huge increase in cases, the system was dogged by shortages and there were reports that key workers, including nurses and firefighters, were unable to access tests to allow them to do their jobs. As medical staff experienced delays in PCR test results and problems accessing rapid tests, NHS Providers called on No 10 to consider reserving some tests for health workers. Some Tory MPs were also demanding answers from government ministers about whether there should be a priority ranking for who should get tests first. Members of the public also complained that tests were hard to find, as pharmacies around England displayed signs that they had run out of lateral flow test (LFT) kits amid “patchy” deliveries and high demand. For the second day in a row the government’s websites showed at times that walk-in PCR tests were unavailable in parts of the country, such as Hartlepool, and in short supply in others, while by mid-afternoon ordering home deliveries of LFTs had again been halted. The overwhelming demand for tests in England follows record levels of infection since the arrival of the Omicron variant. The UK Health and Security Agency acknowledged there was unprecedented demand for tests and urged people not to order more than they needed. But the organisation said another eight million tests were being made available to pharmacists before New Year’s Eve celebrations begin. Pharmacists said demand has been driven by the government allowing vaccinated people out of self-isolation if they show repeated negative LFT results after a week, and among those stocking up on kits before New Year’s Eve events. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said Johnson’s plea for people to take lateral flows when there were shortages showed “spectacular incompetence”. “Congratulations to Boris Johnson who has managed to appear on television today urging people to get tested when people are struggling to access them,” he said. “People are trying to do the right thing, follow the government’s own advice, and test themselves regularly, but are prevented by the Conservative government’s incompetence.” Daisy Cooper, Lib Dem health spokesperson, added that it was “now or never to get Covid tests to frontline workers”. “If the government doesn’t get its act together today then vaccine centres could soon grind to a halt, and patient safety could be at risk from further NHS and care staff absences,” she said. Johnson’s comments on testing have been repeated by other ministers, including the health secretary, Sajid Javid, and health minister Gillian Keegan, who advised new year’s revellers: “Do be cautious, take a lateral flow test before you go out.” There were particular concerns about a lack of tests affecting staff absences in the NHS. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said it was “vital that NHS staff get prompt access to the tests they need to ensure they can return to work as quickly as possible” and suggested “looking at whether we need to reserve dedicated testing capacity for NHS staff for a period”. Dr David Wrigley, the British Medical Association’s deputy council chair, said: “In order to keep the NHS working, it is imperative that staff must be able to regularly test for Covid 19 and so supplies of lateral flow tests for key workers should be prioritised.” New London fire brigade data shows that a third of fire engines in London have been unavailable after more than 700 firefighters either tested positive or were having to self-isolate earlier this week. Staff shortages meant a 64-metre ladder appliance, bought after the Grenfell Tower disaster, was unavailable for much of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, while more than 15% of operational firefighters were off work because of Covid on 27 December. The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, which represents NHS community pharmacies in England, said deliveries of LFT kits to pharmacies had restarted on Wednesday after four days of no service. But many of those that did receive them reported quickly exhausting their supplies. Leyla Hannbeck, chief executive of the Association of Independent Multiple Pharmacies, said: “Pharmacies are reporting that every five minutes approximately somebody comes in to the pharmacy asking for a test. “But, unfortunately, because of the issues around supply being patchy and inconsistent, it means that those who come for the test don’t always get it, which is very stressful not just for the pharmacy team but for the patient.” In Devizes, Devon, the branch of Boots had exhausted its supply of tests by 11am, with two other pharmacies in the town saying they had no kits at all. But Maria Caulfield, the government’s junior health minister, insisted there were “plenty of tests”, in a post to a WhatsApp group of Tory MPs. Caulfield said the “constant speculation that we are running out of tests is just fuelling demand”, and urged colleagues to tell constituents they should “keep trying” to book tests online. Javid is also understood to be preparing a memo for MPs confirming supplies of LFTs and PCRs were safe. However, their assurances were undermined by Tory MPs reporting first-hand problems ordering tests. Roger Gale, the MP for North Thanet, tweeted that “Kent appears to be in Lateral Flow and PCR Test gridlock”. Kent appears to be in Lateral Flow and PCR Test gridlock. Manston staff working flat out, no stocks in chemists and no East Kent delivery slots available. The Secretary of State in charge is not answering his phone, whilst I am trying to get help for constituents. Gale later said he had spoken with Javid and been told “there is a world shortage of Lateral Flow & PCR test supplies, but we are buying all that’s available”. A former minister called the situation a “shitshow” and added Javid’s letter “probably won’t immediately match reality”. A second Tory MP said availability of tests “definitely seems to be an issue”, and a third said a relative who was an essential worker had been unable to order one. The UK Health Security Agency said tests were temporarily unavailable on the government website at points throughout the day due to “exceptionally high demand” and urged people not to order more tests before using the ones they have. A spokesperson said: “During periods of exceptional demand there may be temporary pauses in ordering or receiving tests, to ensure we manage distribution across the system.”",News/World news,"Johnson blamed for Covid test shortages as cases hit record 183,000",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/johnson-blamed-for-covid-test-shortages-as-cases-hit-record-183000
