3/20/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- California is so awash with money that Wall Street is advising it to buy out some of its debt investors.

The pitches underscore the financial strength of California given that the state’s proposed $213 billion budget is bolstered by a $45.7 billion surplus. The state’s progressive tax system rakes in more revenue when the income of its highest earners rises. In fact, the state can generate so much revenue, it may trigger a constitutional limit on spending. Paying off some debt early can help the state get around that requirement, creating a “budget buffer” to preserve its flexibility, Loop said. Since debt service isn’t considered an expenditure under the requirement, California could pay off some general-obligation or lease revenue bonds early, the firm suggested. “Given current budget performance and cash position, the state can also evaluate opportunities to defease bonds with cash,” Morgan Stanley said in its presentation that also listed examples of general-obligation debt that could be paid off early. The documents from both banks included more standard recommendations such as selling new debt to refund higher-cost securities. “Select municipal issuers have begun considering using excess cash to defease outstanding bonds, aided by the influx of cash from the federal government and budget performance,” Morgan Stanley said. It did not give examples. The underwriter declined to comment further. Meanwhile, Loop pointed to New Jersey as an example of an issuer defeasing debt. Last month, the state said it finished paying off $2.25 billion of debt early, saving $607 million over 10 years. Loop spokesperson Jorian Seay-Saunders didn’t respond to requests for comment. “In theory, it’s great to use excess money you have to lower your recurring expenditures,” said Lisa Washburn, a managing director at research firm Municipal Market Analytics. “Since it’s one-time money, you want to make one-time investments.” Currently, there are no plans to defease debt with cash, said California Deputy Treasurer Tim Schaefer by email. Of course, doing so would give California even more capacity to sell new bonds. And Governor Gavin Newsom already has proposed a way to avoid incurring new debt by paying $500 million to complete four capital projects instead of selling taxable municipal bonds. That would save the state $350 million in financing costs. Nevertheless, underwriters are girding for opportunities to help California take on new debt. Ma’s office has received pitches to create bond-funded programs from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and RBC Capital Markets for home down-payment assistance and student loans, the public records show. Goldman declined to comment, and RBC didn’t provide one. Schaefer and H.D. Palmer, a spokesperson for Newsom’s finance department, declined to comment on the underwriters’ recommendations. “It is the nature of our business -- and that of the underwriters -- that a healthy exchange of ideas and creativity is important to a better understanding of the market,” Schaefer said. “Our office encourages this exchange of information and the learning that occurs as a result.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Broke Oligarch Says Sanctioned Billionaires Have No Sway Over Putin A Once Radical Idea to Close the Wealth Gap Is Actually Happening Russia’s Brain Drain Becomes a Stampede for the Exits U.S. Work-Permit Backlog Is Costing Immigrants Their Jobs For Sale: Trudeau’s Oil Pipeline.

3/20/2022,"Coinbase users file a claim against the exchange for allegedly selling securities illegaly. Three plaintiffs list 79 tokens as securities within a 255-page class action suit. The claim not only asks for monetary relief but also injunctions against Coinbase to operate without a securities license. Coinbase is a crypto exchange based in the U.S and listed on the NASDAQ. Supporting crypto trading, Coinbase is one of the world’s leading crypto exchanges, servicing clients in the U.S and overseas. For Coinbase and other major crypto exchanges, it has been a tough 12-months. Increased regulatory scrutiny has placed crypto exchanges and the crypto market in the spotlight. Few, however, would have expected crypto traders to raise the question of security or not security. Over the last week, Coinbase found itself in the unusual position of having to face a class action filed, not by the SEC, but by three Coinbase users. Plaintiffs Christopher Underwood, Louis Oberlander, and Henry Rodriguez have filed a claim against Coinbase Global Inc., Coinbase Inc., and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. The class action lists 79 tokens, alleging that the tokens are securities. Other claims within the class-action include: The list of tokens include, DOGE, DOT, LINK, MANA, MATIC, SHIB, SOL, and XRP, among others. Cryptos such as BTC, ETH, and LUNA are not listed among the 79 tokens. The claim goes on to allege that, Within the 255-page filing, there is also a Prayer for Relief section. Here, the plaintiffs call for appropriate relief that includes rescission, restitution, disgorgement, and injunctions preventing Coinbase from offering tokens for purchase and sale without relevant registrations. For the plaintiffs, the current regulatory landscape makes for a difficult and costly trial, should the case go to court. The SEC case against Ripple Lab and its executives has been ongoing since December 2020. Until the SEC can deliver clear crypto regulations, the age-old question of whether a token is a security will remain unanswered. Interestingly, the plaintiffs chose to omit Ethereum, which forms an integral part of Ripple Lab’s defense. Following a court ruling to allow Ripple to use a fair notice defense last Friday, the SEC is looking for the judge to reconsider its ruling on releasing internal email communications from 2018. The internal communications related to the infamous William Hinam speech, where he said, “Ethereum (ETH) is not a security.” This article was originally posted on FX Empire Euro Attempts to Recover for the Week Gold Markets Have a Tough Week Silver Markets Pull Back for the Week Crude Oil Markets Show Exhaustion Heading Into the Weekend Stock Markets Have a Strong Week Australian Dollar Continues to Dance Around Major Moving Averages During the Week",Business/FX Empire•yesterday,Crypto Investors File a Class Action Against Crypto Giant Coinbase,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-investors-file-class-action-131338717.html
3/20/2022,"(Corrects paragraph 8 to indicate that U.S. bankruptcy is primarily civil, not purely civil) By Dietrich Knauth (Reuters) -As foreign companies seek to exit Russia over the war in Ukraine, they face the prospect that Russian bankruptcy law could be used to seize assets and even lead to criminal penalties. Here is how that could work: HOW DOES RUSSIA'S BANKRUPTCY LAW DIFFER FROM BANKRUPTCY LAW IN THE UNITED STATES? In the United States, bankruptcy laws are meant to give indebted companies a fresh start. Distressed companies in the United States usually enter bankruptcy willingly and the law lets them retain existing management and control over assets. Russia's law, however, generally prioritizes the needs of creditors who are owed money. This means creditors, including the Russian government, can force a company into involuntary bankruptcy and oust its management. Some legal experts said foreign companies fear Russian creditors could abuse that process to install leaders willing to sell their assets to business rivals or companies aligned with the Russian government. ""In the late 90s and early aughts, this was often used as the device to raid companies"" in post-Soviet Russia, said Paul Stephan, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law and expert in the Soviet and post-Soviet legal systems. CAN A BANKRUPT COMPANY FACE CRIMINAL PENALTIES IN RUSSIA? Yes. In the United States, bankruptcy is primarily civil. But Russian courts have been more willing to pursue criminal penalties for some bankruptcy-related offenses, such as hiding assets. Camel and Lucky Strike cigarette maker British American Tobacco Plc has expressed concern that its exit from Russia could be viewed as a criminal act that leads to bankruptcy-related charges for local management. It would not be the first time the Russian government has threatened criminal bankruptcy charges against foreign companies and investors. Russia has repeatedly asked Interpol to arrest money manager Bill Browder, alleging charges against him including deliberate bankruptcy and tax evasion. Browder has said that the ""bogus warrants"" are part of a vendetta by corrupt officials in the Russian state. Interpol has not acceded to Russia's arrest demands. HAS RUSSIAN BANKRUPTCY LAW BEEN USED IN THE PAST TO PUNISH COMPANIES FOR POLITICAL REASONS? Yes. Tax debt has been used to drive companies into bankruptcy in Russia, in a way that penalizes foreign investors, according to an international arbitration court. Yukos Oil was forced into bankruptcy in 2006 after its former chief, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, fell out with Russian leader Vladimir Putin and the Russian government demanded billions in back taxes. Most of Yukos' assets were absorbed by the Kremlin's flagship oil producer Rosneft, but international shareholders argued that the Russian tax demands were illegitimate. The Permanent Court of arbitration in The Hague agreed, finding in 2014 that the Kremlin had manipulated the legal system to bankrupt the company and take Khodorkovsky's assets. Since the Russian government owns major energy companies, it could use energy bills as well as taxes to force a company into bankruptcy, experts said. ""If the government was using that power strategically, it may well have the ability to influence local courts, to influence local managers, and force a sale of the company that would oust foreign owners,"" said Jason Kilborn, a law professor at University of Illinois Chicago. IS THERE A SAFE WAY FOR COMPANIES TO LEAVE RUSSIA? For companies that want to leave Russia, Russian officials have suggested a ""fast-track"" bankruptcy procedure that would put local managers in charge of their assets and operations. Still, some businesses are concerned that Russian bankruptcy law will be used to retaliate against the companies that are leaving, experts said. ""If the hammer really comes down, you just hope that you've gotten as many people as you have out of the country, and you've minimized your asset risk in the country,"" Stephan said. Russia's ruling party has recently proposed legislation that would allow the government to nationalize the assets of certain companies intending to leave Russia. That proposal would build on the bankruptcy law's procedure for installing court-appointed external management, but could be wielded against companies with no debt, experts said.
