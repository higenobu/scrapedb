3/11/2022,"The war between Russia and Ukraine has been widely anticipated to play out online, in addition to on the ground. Moscow’s cyberwar capabilities have long been cause for concern. Russia has a record of coordinating cyber-attacks on the US, Ukraine, and other adversaries. And the country has established itself in recent years as an international hub for cybercrime. Russia’s past has raised fears of a large scale cyberwar effort targeting Ukraine and its allies, including the US. While the Biden administration has reportedly played out potential responses to cyber warfare, some experts have argued that the US is not well prepared for a significant cyber-attack. We spoke with Glenn S Gerstell, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the former general counsel of the National Security Agency, about the likelihood of serious cyber warfare – and whether the US is prepared to respond. “If we had approached this correctly 20 years ago, we would be largely invulnerable to cyber-attacks,” he said. “But unfortunately that is not the case.” What kinds of attacks have we seen thus far in the conflict, and what are we still on the lookout for? We’re seeing a relentless series of attacks against Ukrainian websites, especially those that are government linked and government controlled. That’s part of a pattern we have seen for the past eight years in which Russia has regarded Ukraine as its sort of cyber punching bag. What we have not yet seen are completely destructive attacks on the infrastructure in Ukraine, such as the ones we saw in 2015 and 2016 when Russia seemingly shut down the electric grid. Why is a Russian cyber-attack against Ukraine or its allies so widely anticipated? Russia has used its very formidable cyber skills against the US and other countries in the past – we have seen what it can do in the form of SolarWinds, the Colonial Pipeline hack, and scores of ransomware attacks in every industry in the United States. So we know they are a sophisticated cyber adversary, we know they have a motive to do so – they’d like to throw sand in our gears to disrupt things here and achieve a strategic advantage in the conflict. But whether Vladimir Putin would take the risk of actively engaging in destructive cyber warfare is another matter. What would happen if Russia were to attack the US and how likely is such an attack? I do not see Russia turning off the lights in the United States, for a number of reasons: many people in the US have taken the position that a cyber-attack with real-world destructive effects is the same as a missile attack or bomb, and therefore would be viewed as an act of war. In that case, there is no upside for Putin, because he knows it would trigger a very unclear set of escalations and retaliations. It’s not going to achieve a strategic objective, and may end up very badly, making Russia net worse off. Does the US have a set response to a cyber act of war, like it would for a physical act of war? The US could respond in a number of ways: with a stealth cyber-attack on Russian agencies or a more visible cyber-attack the US openly admits to carrying out. We could also carry out a military action, in response to a cyber-attack and do something physical. There is, of course also a range of economic sanctions the US could take against Russia, it could remove diplomats – the response is quite fluid. How prepared is the US to respond to a cyber-attack from Russia? We’re prepared to respond in the sense that our military has an extraordinary offensive capability to respond on a cyber level – but we are not ready to defend as a country. The private sector is not prepared for attacks. It has relied on buggy software to protect itself, and cyberthreats are growing faster than our ability to adapt to them. We need to impose some kind of mandatory solution, because the pure market solution isn’t viable. The US has been reactive and side-stepped cyber responsibility by simply grafting it on to existing government agencies, making each agency responsible for its own area. Everything from hospitals to bridges to roads and tunnels are relevant to national security, so we need government action to address it with a centralized solution – our national wellbeing depends on it. Could you explain bit further how non-governmental entities are vulnerable to hacks, and what effects that could have? The Biden administration is doing its best to shore up the private sector’s cyberdefenses, but it’s vulnerable – from banks to hospitals, from giant public companies to smaller privately owned ones. Whether Putin would take the risk of a seriously destructive attack on hospitals or water systems or chemical plants is the big question. Logic would tell you that it’s not worth the risk of our retaliation and has little upside for him. But if he’s cornered or feels he doesn’t have much more to lose, who knows? Where does the international community stand on cyber-attacks? When a bomb lands on a sovereign territory, it causes real-world injuries and damage, and we typically know exactly where it launched from and how to respond. But with cyber-attacks, this is not the case. The internet is not constrained by sovereign boundaries. Sometimes hacks are destructive while other times an adversary simply enters a network and violates privacy, stealing secrets and data without causing physical harm. There is, however, a rough consensus that if a cyber act produces a real world harm such as injuring people or causing physical damage, it would be treated as an equivalent to a physical attack by a bomb or missile. This is to say it could be viewed it could be viewed as an act of war and trigger under international law the right to retaliate physically. Why haven’t we seen such a giant destructive hack yet, and could that change? We surely cannot rule it out, but I think we have not experienced it yet for a number of reasons: partly because Ukrainians have been more successful when defending and securing their network, or that Russia has made a strategic decision not to destroy the economy of a country that they hoped to soon occupy. In terms of attacks on the US, Putin knows if he were to authorize a destructive hack he would be met with a very strong response. It raises the stakes of our military retaliation, which is not good for him. He is likely making a strategic calculation that nobody can really understand unless you are in Putin’s mind. However, it is entirely possible that if we get to a situation where Putin is cornered or feels that he’s going to not succeed, he might act irrationally. The calculus may change as Russia reasons that they are already bombing civilians, they are already are infuriating the international community. Why not turn off the electric grid? We cannot rule that out.",News/Technology,‘We are not ready’: a cyber expert on US vulnerability to a Russian attack,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/10/us-russia-cyber-attack-prepared
3/11/2022,"As Joe Biden ratchets up the pressure on Russia by banning imports of its oil, American drivers grumble about rising gasoline prices and the oil and gas industry clamors for more land to drill, a more fundamental demand has emerged – for the US to decisively cut its umbilical reliance upon fossil fuels. Environmental groups and progressive Democrats are aiming to build upon the backlash to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by ending the era of fossil fuel dependency and help address the unfolding climate crisis. “This moment is a clarion call for the urgent need to transition to domestic clean energy so that we are never again complicit in fossil-fueled conflict,” said Ed Markey, the Democratic senator who helped devise the Green New Deal platform. The climate measures in Biden’s moribund Build Back Better legislation may now be resurrected, Democrats hope, with several of the party’s senators unveiling a flurry of bills to ensure renewable energy replaces the banned Russian oil imports and to tax oil companies enjoying a financial bonanza from oil prices that have soared due to the crisis in Ukraine. Green groups want Biden to go even further. More than 200 environmental and indigenous organizations have signed a letter demanding he use the Defense Production Act, normally used in times of war to compel companies to churn out tanks, aircraft and other weapons, to force businesses to produce solar panels, wind turbines, heat pumps and other climate-friendly material. “Biden is in the ideal position to declare a national climate emergency and use his existing emergency powers to push the accelerator on renewable energy,” said Jean Su, senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the signatories. “There’s a war with a fossil fuel oligarch and we are in a climate war, so we need to attack this on a wartime footing. The best thing we can do is defend the world from the violence of fossil fuel combustion. This is the defining moment of the Biden presidency and of the climate emergency itself.” Biden has said that the fallout from the Ukraine war “should motivate to us accelerate to a transition of clean energy”. But he has also jarringly boasted that more oil is now being pumped in the US than during Donald Trump’s tenure, in order to counter accusations that not enough is being done to tamp down the spiraling cost of gasoline for drivers. The conflict has underscored the volatile grip fossil fuels continue to have over geopolitics and people’s everyday lives, causing a reckoning for Europe, which relies upon Russia for 40% of its gas supply, and dealing painful gasoline price increases to low-income people in car-dependent America. The burning of fossil fuels also directly kills nearly 9 million people around the world each year from toxic air pollution and is the primary driver of global heating that scientists warn will acutely harm half of the planet’s population. The International Energy Agency has warned no new fossil fuel projects can commence if the world is to avoid disastrous climate change. “We live in a world where a product we rely on to function is subject to the actions of dictators and a cartel,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director of energy policy at Energy Innovation. “We have to decide if we want to continue that way.” Freeing the US from its ravenous appetite for oil, gas and coal will be a sizable task. Nearly 80% of US energy consumption comes from fossil fuels, with the country burning through around 20m barrels of petroleum, around a fifth of the global total, every day. The US is the world’s leading crude oil producer and imports a large volume of oil – usually heavier, thicker product than it can pump at home – from other countries. Four million barrels of oil flow each day from Canada alone. Weaning the US from this diet of hydrocarbons will require the passage of half a trillion dollars in clean energy tax credits proposed in the Build Back Better bill, according to analysts, which would bring America within striking distance of cutting its greenhouse gas emissions in half this decade. “The clean energy tax credits and other provisions would really catalyze the industry and achieve significant reductions,” said Orvis, who has calculated that the support for wind, solar and electric cars would slash US oil demand, make 70% of the electricity grid run on clean energy and ensure around half of vehicle sales are electric by 2030. Wind and solar grew at the fastest rate in US history last year. The ailing coal industry could be phased out “fairly easily” within a decade, according to Orvis, although further federal, state and city standards and incentives are required to cut pollution from buildings, manufacturing and the remaining car fleet, promote energy efficiency and to install heat pumps in place of gas-fired furnaces. “The sooner we start that transition will determine how fast we can go,” Orvis said. “Every day we don’t start the transition we are subject to the price swings from fossil fuels that we are clearly subject to now.” The oil and gas industry, and its allies in Congress, has a different framing of the concept of “energy independence”, accusing Biden of stymying a vast increase in drilling on public land even as it sits on millions of acres of unused permits in order to reap the benefits of an oil price that has hit near record highs. “The first, immediate action item is to increase our domestic oil and gas production on both federal and non-federal lands,” said Joe Manchin, the centrist Democrat and Senate energy committee chairman who has accused Vladimir Putin of using energy as a “weapon” against the US and whose opposition has so far blocked the passage of Build Back Better. Experts say an increase in domestic drilling would take months, or even years, to influence gasoline prices that are determined by the vagaries of a global oil market. “The idea of energy independence is sort of ridiculous, oil is a global commodity and we export a lot of oil and gas ourselves,” said Michael Webber, an expert in energy resources at the University of Texas. “What we are seeing is one more chapter of fossil fuels’ impact on world politics,” he added. “What’s going on in Ukraine is partly a resource war. It’s not like we will have zero problems with renewables – you still need minerals for renewable energy infrastructure. But we’d have far less than we have now.”",News/US news,‘Defining moment’: how can the US end its dependency on fossil fuels?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/11/us-fossil-fuel-dependency-climate-joe-biden-oil-russia
3/11/2022,"Over the past few days, images of desperate Ukrainian families being turned away by officials have thrown the UK’s response to what has been termed the biggest refugee crisis since the second world war into stark contrast with its European neighbours. So far the UK has refused to match the EU’s decision to offer Ukrainians open sanctuary, instead operating a limited family reunification and humanitarian sponsorship system. A concession on Thursday from the Home Office, struggling to show that it is keeping on top of the situation, means that Ukrainians with passports will be able to apply for British visas online and give their biometric information once in the country, a marginal simplification of the web of bureaucracy that Ukrainians attempting to take refuge in the UK face. However on Tuesday, the EU home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, stood in front of the European parliament and stated that all Ukrainians fleeing the war would continue to be welcomed with open arms by EU countries. “Millions more will flee and we must welcome them,” she said. Within days of Russia’s invasion, EU states decided to activate the hitherto unused Temporary Protection Directive (TPD), which gives any Ukrainian national the right to live and work in the EU for up to three years. They will also be able to access education and housing without having to claim asylum. Over the past 12 days, the EU has accepted more refugees than in the crisis of 2015 and 2016, when 1.3 million people applied for asylum in the 28 member states of the EU, Norway and Switzerland. Poland has been the first point for Ukrainians escaping Russia’s invasion, with more than 1.4 million already in the country, compared with 258,000 elsewhere in Europe, according to the UN’s refugee agency. Tens of thousands more are crossing every day. A huge volunteer army has mobilised since the first refugee crossings to provide food, blankets and healthcare. Thousands of Polish families have also invited Ukrainians to stay in their homes. The Polish parliament is considering a bill that would immediately give Ukrainians residency for 18 months and give financial aid to communities, local authorities and families hosting them. Germany had registered more than 80,000 refugees from Ukraine by Wednesday. The country has immediately given arrivals the right to work and children access to education. The country was also one of the first to offer free train travel from Poland, with volunteers on board providing food and water and helping Ukrainians access accommodation or arrange onward travel. France has been critical of the UK’s “technocratic” approach and has itself received more than 7,500 refugees, the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, said on Thursday. The government said it was preparing to receive up 100,000 more in the coming weeks, and on a local level authorities and town halls are organising temporary accommodation, including for those arriving in Calais hoping to get visas for the UK. The French government has set up a website to help to connect families offering accommodation with charities. Paris’s Gare de l’Est station has been a key welcoming point for the refugees, with volunteers helping arrivals with food and advice. Italy has one of Europe’s largest Ukrainian communities and had taken in around 20,000 refugees by Wednesday, according to the government, with as many as 800,000 expected in total. It has been testing arrivals for Covid-19 and offering vaccinations, while some of the refugees are being housed in former Covid quarantine hotels. Spain’s regional presidents meet over the weekend to discuss how a country that has so far taken in around 2,000 Ukrainian nationals will prepare for further arrivals; it is readying reception places for up to 12,000 in the coming weeks and will extend its facilities to meet demand. Earlier this week, the interior ministry of the Czech Republic said the country had already taken in more than 100,000 Ukrainian refugees since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. Four days after the Temporary Protection Directive was triggered by EU states on 3 March, the Czech government had already processed about 57,000 “special” visas, more than half of which went to children. The Czech Republic had a large Ukrainian diaspora of more than 197,000 before the war began. Greece has accepted about 7,000 Ukrainians since the refugee exodus began, according to migration ministry officials. This week the education minister, Niki Kerameus, said more than 1,000 refugee children, mostly from the war-torn country’s sizeable ethnic Greek community, were poised to be enrolled in local schools, with special classes being set up for those who did not know the language. On Wednesday Cyprus’s interior ministry said close to 3,000 Ukrainians had flown into the Mediterranean island, itself partitioned by war, since 25 February, the day after Russian forces crossed into Ukraine. Of that number, 19 had sought asylum, the ministry said.",News/Global development,‘We must welcome them’: how Europe is helping Ukrainian refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/11/we-must-welcome-them-how-europe-is-helping-ukrainian-refugees

We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. The closer I get to Hope Cove, winding down through roads that become ever narrower, the more I understand why this village was once a smuggling hotspot. It lies on a remote edge of South Hams, between Salcombe and Bigbury-on-Sea, so getting here takes effort, and by the time the authorities had arrived, all the silks, tobacco and other booty would have been stashed away. Nestled in the outstretched arms of Bigbury Bay, the tranquil cove is well hidden from prying eyes out at sea as well as on land. Yet a few hours due south of here by boat is the French town of Roscoff, which became a major smuggling port after the British government clamped down on illicit shipments from the Channel Islands in the 18th century. At the height of the smuggling boom, luggers from Roscoff would drop consignments of brandy in the shallow waters of this bay and fishermen from Hope Cove would later bring them ashore in an operation that saw most of the villagers playing cat and mouse with customs officials. Hope Cove is actually made up of two villages, Outer and Inner Hope. I park by the Hope & Anchor pub in Outer Hope and begin my walk on the narrow street that forms part of the South West Coast Path. I’m heading south towards Inner Hope, between the cottages in which smuggled goods were once hidden until they could be sold on. Aside from a few dog walkers and a bellyboarding couple in wetsuits, I see few other people as I set off. The bellyboarders’ occasional shrieks as they catch small, cold waves follow me as I leave. Out of season, this corner of South Hams is wonderfully quiet, though it was not always so peaceful. In November 1840, the London Times reported that villagers from Hope Cove had attacked a coastguard crew who’d seized their contraband, almost drowning the commanding officer. In another clash, the women of the village were caught preparing donkeys for smuggling, arrested en masse and jailed at Exeter for insulting the coastguard officers. According to one (possibly embellished) account, on being released they managed to filch the kettle from the jail. A local resident tells me that some of the old smuggling tunnels that ran up from the beach to the cellars of the houses are still there. By the lifeboat slipway, a track leads up steps into woods and emerges on to the headland at Bolt Tail. Where Hope Cove is enclosed and protected, Bolt Tail is high up and exposed. The coast path leads slightly inland here, but the headland is crisscrossed with desire lines, and I wander the interweaving paths above the cliffs, making my way out to the tip of the headland, for views back across the bay on one side and a stunning seascape on the other, before joining the main route again. The sea is perfectly calm when I visit, but the 30 shipwrecks on the bay’s seabed tell a different story, as do the anchor and cannon from the wreck of HMS Ramillies that sit by the road in Hope Cove. Here, the gentle can become rough in an instant. While the bay was, and still is, used as a safe anchorage in a storm, ships heading here would often find themselves in trouble in a southerly blow, realising too late that they could not steer out of the bay and being driven on to the rocks below Bolt Tail. While smuggling and tall ships are firmly in Hope Cove’s past, fishing is still part of its present. From the headland I watch fishers pulling lobster pots in the bay as I try to make out the cliffs of Cornwall’s Rame Head in the far distance. The smugglers along this stretch of coast benefited from its proximity to Cornwall – we’re only 12 miles from Plymouth Sound here, and locals knew that customs officials on one side of the county border would not pursue smugglers across it. Beyond Bolt Tail, the track becomes a gravel path, and at the carpark at Bolberry Down I join the road again below a phone mast. I’m always reluctant to turn inland when I’ve been looking out to sea, but the soft greens of Devon countryside, with views into the heart of South Hams, provide yet another contrast; and a few hundred metres further on, the holloway named Sweetheart’s Lane is filled with birdsong and feels as though it belongs to another time and place entirely. Looping back through several fields, with the village of Galmpton visible to the right, I catch sight of the sea again, and the rooftops of Hope Cove. I follow the path down the side of the pretty church of Saint Clements, which leads back out onto the cove. Back at the beach the shrieking bellyboarders, like the smugglers, are long gone, and though I do not find any of the smugglers’ tunnels from the beach, the cove’s rockpools are well worth investigating at low tide. The 18th-century Hope & Anchor is all welcoming woodburners and cosiness. In the dining room, it turns out I am the only first-time visitor and conversation turns gently competitive as to who has the longest-standing relationship with the pub. The couple at the table next to me have been coming here for 40 years and those opposite for 30. I can see why. It’s the sort of place that inspires return visits and conversations with strangers. Refurbished in May 2020, it strikes a balance between understated style and Devon charm. The food ranges from an excellent catch of the day to tagines and vegan “fish” and chips, much of which is offered in smaller portions for lunch. The rooms (some dog-friendly) have the same sense of relaxed, cosy comfort as the rest of the pub. Mine looks out to sea over the thatched roof of Beachcomber Cottage, which sleeps eight and is also let by the pub. Though it is winter, I open the windows to better let in the sound of the breaking waves, and keep half an ear open for any approaching luggers from Roscoff …Doubles from £110 B&B, hopeandanchor.co.uk The Draw of The Sea, by Wyl Menmuir, will be published in July",Lifestyle/Travel,"A great walk to a great pub: the Hope & Anchor, Hope Cove, Devon",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/mar/11/a-great-walk-to-a-great-pub-the-hope-anchor-hope-cove-devon

And who will step into the vacuum he leaves behind? Might it be Jamie (Micheal Ward) who is out of jail and tentatively exploring a collaboration with Dushane? Possibly, but their truce seems fragile. The biggest strength of this series is its air of melancholy – there’s rarely any sense of glamour about these gangsters’ activities.

3/11/2022,"The election of an avowed “anti-feminist” as the next president of South Korea has been greeted with dismay amid accusations Yoon Suk-yeol fuelled the county’s gender divide to garner support from young male voters. Former top prosecutor Yoon defeated the liberal ruling party candidate Lee Jae-myung by a margin of 263,000 votes in one of the most closely contested presidential elections in recent memory. Yoon has blamed the country’s low birthrate on feminism. He has called for the abolishment of the gender equality ministry, which he says focuses too much on women’s rights and is no longer necessary. He has promised to enhance punishments for false accusations of sexual violence, a step campaigners say will deter even more women from coming forward. An exit poll showed only 34% of women in their 20s marked Yoon on their ballot paper, compared with 59% of men in their 20s, and 53% of those in their 30s. Kim Hye-yoon, a 34-year-old woman from Gwangju, said she felt “bitter” at the result. “Everyone knows that misogyny in Korea is a serious problem, and while it’s comforting to see change is occurring, when I saw the election of a candidate who pledged misogyny, I knew we still have a long way to go,” she says. Kim said the result was expected, given so much criticism of the current administration, including a sluggish economy and soaring house prices. South Korea suffers from poisonous gender politics. Many young men regard women’s advancement as a threat to their financial security, amid a bleak job market and rising living costs, especially when they have to serve mandatory military service in addition. Surveys have shown that young men believe that it is they who are victims of gender discrimination, fuelling a gender divide that has been exploited by politicians. Jieun Choi is a South Korean journalist and survivor of spycam crime – the use of secret cameras to film women, often in public toilets. She said the election was a “pivotal moment” in terms of how women’s issues are talked about in public discourse. “The major parties, especially the conservative party, didn’t shy away from using misogyny as a political tactic,” she says, adding that the solidarity young women felt in 2022 was reminiscent of the way massive street protests were organised by women online against the use of spycams in 2018. “A lot of my friends were devastated by the result,” she says. After Yoon’s election, the Korea Women’s Associations United issued a statement accusing him of “disappointing many people by actively using the degenerative and fictional frame of hate agitation and gender conflict” and urging the incoming government to fulfil its responsibility to realise gender equality. After Yoon’s election, the Korea Women’s Associations United issued a statement accusing him of “disappointing many people by actively using the regressive and fictional frame of hate incitement and gender conflict” and urging the incoming government to fulfil its responsibility to realise gender equality. During a press conference, he denied promoting a gender divide. Some controversial comments made in the run-up to the election suggest otherwise. On international women’s day, which fell the day before the election, he retracted a description of himself as a feminist in a Washington Post interview. His camp described the wording as an “administrative error”. He has stated that South Korea has “no structural gender discrimination,” describing it instead as a “personal matter”, despite ample evidence suggesting otherwise in indices measuring women’s rights and gender equality. Women continue to face everyday sexism, including pervasive digital sex crimes. Some 80% of survivors of spycam crime are women, 98% of perpetrators are men. Yanglee Hyun-kyung, co-representative of Korea Women’s Associations United, said she was “worried” about gender equality policies being ignored under Yoon. “Korean society will continue to be very unequal and polarised, and I am very concerned about how this discrimination will be resolved,” she said at an event in Seoul denouncing the politics of hate and discrimination on Friday. “Yoon’s call to abolish the gender equality ministry was an election strategy based on distorted misinformation. I hope he will realise the importance of it when he becomes president.” No official statement has been released regarding the possible dismantling of the gender equality ministry. An official who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity said the mood in the ministry was “quiet” but that staff would continue to work hard as normal until further notice. If Yoon follows through on his pledge, it is unclear whether it will be accepted by the country’s parliament, where the now opposition Democratic party has a majority. Some observers predict that his policy of abolishment may become more of a reorganisation. Kim Hye-yoon is looking towards the future – presidents in South Korea are limited to a single five-year term. “I think we will be able to write a new history of women’s politicisation if we work hard for the next five years.”",News/World news,‘Devastated’: gender equality hopes on hold as ‘anti-feminist’ voted South Korea’s president ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/south-korea-gender-equality-anti-feminist-president-yoon-suk-yeol
