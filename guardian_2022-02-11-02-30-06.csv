2/11/2022,"The American experimental composer George Crumb, who has died aged 92, came to prominence in the mid-1960s with a series of ground-breaking compositions scored for unusual instrumental combinations, using then still-novel performing techniques. One of the most remarkable works to come out of these departures was the haunting Ancient Voices of Children (1970), setting five poems by Federico García Lorca. As well as singing, its solo soprano is called upon to intone softly over the strings of the piano in order to set up sympathetic vibrations; breathe and whisper through a paper funnel; and screech. Elsewhere Crumb required players to sing, whistle or double up on percussion, or play the piano directly on the strings with paper clips. In the trio Vox Balaenae (Voice of the Whale) (1971), the flautist sings and groans through the instrument as well as playing it conventionally, and the ranges of the cello and piano are similarly expanded.  Crumb was an early adopter of electronic and amplified instruments, for example in Songs, Drones and Refrains of Death (1968), for baritone and an ensemble comprising electric guitar, electric bass, two amplified pianos and percussion. In Black Angels (1970) for “electric string quartet” the four performers’ instruments are amplified, and they speak and play a small array of unpitched percussion. It marked a protest against the Vietnam war raging at the time, and specifically against the use of helicopter gunships. The use of the amplified piano, sometimes accompanied by percussion, was a recurrent fixture in Crumb’s work from then on, most vividly in the four collections of illustrative pieces inspired by the Zodiac and entitled Makrokosmos (1972-79). Its title pointed to a counterpart at several removes in the six volumes of character pieces for piano, Mikrokosmos, by Béla Bartók. The Hungarian composer’s Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion (1937) was a formative influence, as was, at a more fundamental level, the music of the Viennese serialist Anton Webern. Indeed, Makrokosmos vol 3 (1974), subtitled Music for a Summer Evening, used two amplified pianos and two percussionists to create its by turns hypnotic and evocative soundscapes. In his own generation, Crumb’s exploratory approach was akin to that of another Hungarian, Gyorgy Ligeti. Amplified piano was the medium for Crumb’s last major collection, the two volumes of Metamorphoses (2015-20), 20 “fantasy-pieces after celebrated paintings”, inspired by the works of artists ranging from Whistler and Van Gogh to Klee and Jasper Johns. His final completed composition proved to be, in typically unconventional fashion, a percussion quintet, Kronos-Kryptos (2019, revised in 2021 after the composer made a recovery from a stroke). There were almost always illustrative, dramatic or expressive purposes behind Crumb’s mature music, whether in his many vocal cycles, such as the seven volumes of the American Songbook (2003-10) and the three of the Spanish Songbook (2008-12), or what proved to be his largest composition, the vocal-and-orchestral Star-Child (1977), which won the 2001 Grammy for best contemporary classical composition. The recording was released in Bridge Records’ ongoing complete Crumb edition. Often his music took on a mystical quality, sometimes reflected in the graphical notation of particular scores, as in the circles of Eleven Echoes of Autumn, 1965, completed the following spring, or the Spiral Galaxy finale of Makrokosmos vol 1, where the music is laid out as a helix. Born into a musical family in Charleston, West Virginia, George was the son of Vivian (nee Reed), a cellist, and George Crumb Sr, a clarinettist. His father taught him the clarinet, and he started composing in his teens. A summer course at the National Music Camp in Interlochen, Michigan, in 1947 was followed by a bachelor’s degree from the Mason College of Music and Fine Arts (now part of the University of Charleston) in 1950. He gained further degrees from the universities of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (1952) and Michigan (1959). In between, a Fulbright scholarship enabled him to study in Berlin with Boris Blacher. Crumb began teaching at a college in Virginia, and from 1958 at the University of Colorado, before moving in 1965 to the University of Pennsylvania, where he remained until retiring in 1997. A Pulitzer prize (1968) for his orchestral suite, Echoes of Time and the River, commissioned by the University of Chicago to mark its 75th anniversary in 1965, was followed by many other awards. Though outwardly he was a relatively shy man, his pupils, including the composers Jennifer Higdon, Christopher Rouse, Margaret Brouwer and Osvaldo Golijov, all spoke of his warm-hearted and gentle personality. He was able to nurture the best in all he worked with, including the many performers of his own works, most of which are enormously demanding. On occasion he could be blunt: when asked for an opinion on a fellow American composer’s music he described it succinctly as “horseshit”. In 1949 he married the pianist Elizabeth Brown, with whom he had three children: Ann, a singer, David, also a composer, and Peter. Ann died in 2019, and he is survived by Elizabeth, his two sons and a sister, Ruth.  George Henry Crumb, composer, born 24 October 1929; died 6 February 2022",Arts/Music,George Crumb obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/10/george-crumb-obituary
2/11/2022,"It tracks that Steven Soderbergh, a film-maker who’s spent his retirement from making films mostly making more films, would try his very best to maximise time during the pandemic. Not only do his intimidatingly extensive lists of everything he’s been watching and reading show that he’s obsessively consuming, but he’s also been frantically creating, finishing one movie and then making two others in full. His new deal with HBO Max has seen him take Meryl Streep out on a boat in the elegant, semi-improvised comedy Let Them All Talk before sticking to the Michigan mainland in the tense crime drama No Sudden Move. His latest is a far simpler, yet no less enjoyable, achievement, a tight, mostly one-location thriller riffing on Alfred Hitchcock as well as OG Hitchcock riffer Brian De Palma.  Kimi is the name of an Alexa-style device with a key USP: people. A large scattered team of operatives sift through the many interactions between users and machines to perfect the dynamic, ensuring that miscommunication is kept to a minimum. Zoë Kravitz’s agoraphobic Angela (perhaps a reference to The Net’s similarly named hacker) spends her days listening to such audio, quarantining herself from the world as Covid rumbles on. The pandemic has set her anxieties back and she refuses to go outside despite an over-the-road neighbour (comedian Byron Bowers) trying to tempt her on a date. But when Angela hears something sinister on a flagged Kimi stream, her safe, insulated world is suddenly in disarray. In a sleek 89 minutes, writer David Koepp (whose similarly contained thriller Panic Room was notably watched by Soderbergh twice last year) keeps things refreshingly simple and stringently devoid of any extraneous padding. It’s no surprise, after an opening tease concerning the financial specifics of the company behind Kimi, that there’s a conspiracy to unravel but it unravels with a quick ease, an age-old tale of the hero who saw too much and the villain who wants to keep them quiet. We know where films like this tend to go, and Kimi is light on genuine surprise, but Koepp and Soderbergh keep most of it grounded, avoiding the clumsy narrative leaps these films often resort to, making so much of it feel awfully credible. Like Soderbergh’s other late-stage thrillers, from Contagion to Side Effects to Unsane to the miniseries Mosaic, Kimi firmly exists in a real-world setting with real-world rules, and although lightly etched, it’s a rare tech thriller that doesn’t unintentionally slip into science-fiction. The inclusion of a more evolved Amazon Echo is handled with a deftness that’s been missing from other recent-ish examples of voice AI movies, from the schlocky Netflix thriller Tau to the comedy disasters Jexi and Superintelligence, its role here rising far above mere gimmickry. Koepp isn’t trying to make larger Ted Talk points about big tech – there’s really no time for that – but with light jabs, he provides a rather bleak state of the union with regards to issues of privacy and corporate morality. This crescendoes rather brilliantly in a standout scene involving Angela leaving her enviable apartment (the size of which is perhaps one of the film’s more hard-to-stomach elements) for an uncomfortable meeting with her employers, personified by an ingeniously cast Rita Wilson, subverting her wide-smiled cheeriness to chilling effect. It’s the moment that then launches Kimi into an inevitable chase (for what is a film such as this without a chase?), anxiety edged up a few notches by Kravitz’s believable unease with being back in the wide world. She’s an actor whose soft-spoken minimalism often makes her a little too aloof, but that’s well utilised here, and there’s a great deal of fun in watching her cathartically and violently snatch back her agency in the rousing finale. After watching so many pandemic-shot films that felt shoddily thrown together, it’s such a pleasure to be in the confident hands of a film-maker like Soderbergh, whose crisp and stylish cinematography (he uses his pseudonym Peter Andrews to shoot once again) turns a modest direct-to-streaming film into something utterly cinematic, assisted by Cliff Martinez’s wonderfully grand, old-school score. Koepp’s script also uses the background of Covid as a quietly accepted part of life in the early 2020s, rather like Rob Savage’s jolting Zoom horror Host, instead of relying on tired banana-bread jokes and/or involving it in the thrust of the main plot, one of the few films to modulate its presence effectively. Kimi is in some ways a minor Soderbergh entry, an exercise in style rather than something of great substance, but it’s a thrill to watch him at play, even when he’s taking it easy, he’s still working harder than most of his peers. Kimi is now on HBO Max in the US with a UK date to be announced",Arts/Film,Kimi review – Steven Soderbergh’s sleek and stylish tech thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/10/kimi-review-steven-soderbergh-thriller-zoe-kravitz
2/11/2022,"As many as 3,000 workers in five of Sanjeev Gupta’s Liberty Steel plants across England face losing their jobs after HM Revenue and Customs filed petitions to wind up their operating companies over unpaid taxes. Gupta’s GFG Alliance metals empire could be at risk if four Liberty companies fail to reach an agreement with HMRC and other creditors, after a year of struggles after the collapse of Greensill Capital, its main lender.  Unions condemned the move as a devastating blow, saying the plants must be kept open because of Liberty’s strategic importance to the UK economy. The four companies under threat are Speciality Steel UK, which employs close to 2,000 people at Rotherham and Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire; Liberty Merchant Bar at Scunthorpe in North Lincolnshire; Liberty Performance Steels Limited at West Bromwich in the West Midlands; and Liberty Pipes at Hartlepool in County Durham. The accounting regulator also announced separately on Thursday that it had opened an investigation into the audit of Liberty Commodities Ltd, another part of the sprawling network of GFG companies. The audit, covering the year ending 31 March 2020, was carried out by HW Fisher, a London accountancy firm. GFG declined to comment on the investigation. HW Fisher was approached for comment. The petitions and investigation added to the difficulties facing Gupta as he seeks to keep his businesses afloat while engaging in drawn-out refinancing talks to replace the money borrowed from Greensill, founded by Australian entrepreneur Lex Greensill. Greensill, who later hired former UK prime minister David Cameron as an adviser, had bankrolled the expansion of Gupta’s empire. The UK’s Serious Fraud Office is also investigating suspected fraud, fraudulent trading and money laundering related to GFG’s financing and its links to Greensill. GFG and Gupta have denied any wrongdoing and have promised to cooperate with the investigation. The Rotherham and Stocksbridge sites are particularly important parts of GFG’s UK operations. They make tougher, anti-corrosive steel that is required by the aerospace industry and some other applications like oil and gas exploration. The plants had suffered from stop-start production amid plummeting demand caused by pandemic restrictions on flying, but in recent months demand is thought to have picked up. Nevertheless, the pressures on Gupta’s companies have been compounded by energy prices, which have surged at an unprecedented rate in recent months. Energy costs have meant the plants are operating at less-than-full capacity despite global high prices for steel, according to a source briefed on the operations. A Liberty Steel spokesperson highlighted “a very challenging backdrop in the UK with record high energy prices”. The UK’s main steel unions, Community, GMB and Unite, issued a joint statement on Thursday decrying HMRC’s actions, arguing that they risked pushing the plants under. The unions said: “This action by HMRC threatens thousands of jobs and is a devastating blow to our members and their families. Liberty Steel is a strategically important business, crucial to delivering net zero, and under no circumstances can our plants be allowed to close.” The Liberty Steel spokesperson also criticised HMRC, saying: “We are in continuous dialogue with all our creditors including HMRC to find an amicable solution that’s in the best interest of all stakeholders. Short-term actions that risk destabilising these efforts are not in anyone’s interest, and undermine creditor recovery at a critical stage in our debt restructuring efforts that seek to secure the future of our businesses.” The company’s “priority has been to protect thousands of jobs in the UK” but it is “committed to repaying all our creditors”, the spokesperson said. HMRC declined to comment on the criticisms. A spokesperson said: “We take a supportive approach to dealing with customers who have tax debts, working with them to find the best possible solution based on their financial circumstances.”",News/Business,Thousands of Liberty Steel jobs at risk in England as HMRC files winding-up order,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/10/thousands-of-liberty-steel-jobs-at-risk-england-hmrc-winding-up-order

As such, it is incumbent on the respondent to give full and accurate answers at all times. Failure to do so may result in further criminal proceedings being taken against you. Name: Rishi Sunak.  Is it really?: Yes. It’s not, is it?: Er ... You’re Boris Johnson, aren’t you?: Gosh! So I am. That’s better. Try to make this easier for all of us. Name: Boris Johnson. Provide full details of the event at Downing Street on 20 May 2020: From contemporaneous notes I made subsequent to this party that wasn’t a party becoming public knowledge, I see that I had a meeting with Party Marty … I mean, my principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds ... on that morning in my office. We discussed the ongoing Covid crisis and at no time did Martin suggest to me that it would be a nice idea to take advantage of the nice weather and to throw a bash for all the staff in No 10. And I definitely did not say that was a good idea, providing everyone brought their own booze as I was getting fed up with everyone getting pissed at my expense. I also don’t remember Martin giving me an odd wink on the way out and telling me not to read the email he was about to send urging everyone to work even harder. On their suntans. I then went back to my desk where I spent the day writing a speech about how the country needed to make personal sacrifices and anyone caught breaking lockdown restrictions would be banged up. And that’s about all I can remember. No, it’s not. Go on: Er … after another tough day of being prime minister, I went downstairs with Carrie to have a quiet drink in the garden. When I got there, I was amazed to find Party Marty and 40 members of staff already sprawled out under the trestle tables and on the lawn. Not least because I had been expecting to find 100 people there. The invitation, that I hadn’t seen, had quite specifically instructed all Downing Street personnel to attend the work seminar on how to give a socially distanced power point party, so it was disappointing that so many people had bunked off early. That wasn’t the kind of “can-do” spirit I expected of my staff. I was then asked to give a short speech thanking the NHS heroes who were working night and day to fight the virus. My suggestion that the best way we could honour the doctors and nurses was by getting completely shit-faced was particularly well received. I’m afraid that after about half an hour I left this work event to go back upstairs to my flat, but I was pleased to see that the rest of the staff stayed on to work late into the night. One couple were so dedicated that they were still there the next morning. They had to be fished out of the flower beds, along with all the empties, by the Downing Street maintenance staff. One of the policemen at No 10 later told me he had watched the proceedings on the CCTV cameras and it had been one of the best work events he had ever seen at No 10. I told him that a prime minister always had to be alive to new ways of working. Provide full details of the event at Downing Street on 19 June 2020: My birthday! My recollection of this is rather fuzzy. What I can remember is that I had been out at a school in Milton Keynes where I had lectured the children on the importance of not having a birthday party and had come back to Downing Street fully expecting to work alone in the cabinet room on the next phase of my Covid recovery plan. But immediately I got in the room I was ambushed by a cake, a crate of beers and about 20 people, including Carrie, Lulu Lytle and the chancellor. I was later told that it was Rishi Sunak who had organised this event, along with many others in Downing St, in an attempt to discredit me. At no point did I once consider this to have been a party, however, as no one was taken to hospital to have their stomach pumped. The two choruses of Happy Birthday to Me were merely sung to ensure that everyone in the room washed their hands for the requisite period of time. I then had a meeting with cabinet colleagues, Carrie and Lulu about how to get Lord Brownlow to pay for the hideous wallpaper. I didn’t even get a proper present. Provide full details of the event(s) at Downing Street on 13 November, 2020: It is possible that I may have very briefly dropped in to give a brief speech at Lee Cain’s leaving do. Which also definitely wasn’t a party. Just a work event at which everyone was getting pissed. And if I was there, I definitely said it was someone else’s turn to fill up the suitcase with booze at the Co-op. Not that there was a drinking culture on my watch. I’ve always been a stickler for keeping to the rules. “Sure you have,” said Caino. So it must be true. What about the other event that night?: What party? I mean, event. The one in your flat to celebrate Dominic Cummings’s exit: There wasn’t one. I should know. Because I was there. At no stage did Carrie ever have her friends into the flat because that would have been a breach of the regulations. Which you can see from my previous answers I would never have tolerated. As I said, I went up to the flat on my own to find that Carrie was singing along with her friends who weren’t there to an Abba documentary on the TV. “Could you turn it down a bit?” I asked as I wanted to work. At some point I may have given up and joined the gang in a chorus of, Mamma Mia, and this may be when I tripped over the dog and spilt red wine over the sofa. Which is where I was made to spend the night. Provide full details of the events at Downing Street on 17 December, 2020 and 14 January, 2021: As you don’t appear to have any photographs of me at these alleged events, I am denying I was there. But if pictures do emerge of me, then I can assure you it was all entirely innocent and definitely not against the lockdown guidelines. All I’ve ever tried to do is serve my country and I don’t expect anyone who knows how hard I have worked to begrudge me doing what the hell I liked. Provide full details of the event at Downing Street on 15 December 2020: Oh FFS. Now you’re just being petty. One photo of me looking the worse for wear, an open magnum of champagne and two civil servants dressed in tinsel and paper hats and you immediately leap to the conclusion that we’re having a party. Haven’t you got anything better to do? This was clearly a work event. An exam to test the staff’s knowledge of which rules they were allowed to break. Hell, everyone was getting pissed with mates, weren’t they? Are these your full answers and do you believe them to be true?: I do. They sound like lies to us.

2/11/2022,"The fight for democracy and media freedom in Hong Kong feels like it has “entered its endgame”, after a year of crackdowns, arrests and forced closures of outlets, the International Federation for Journalists has said. In a report on the ongoing threats to the press in Hong Kong, titled Lights Out, the IFJ called on governments to offer support and pathways for Hong Kong journalists seeking to flee the city and find refuge to keep working. It noted “a clear and documented exodus and closure of both local and international media outlets, journalists and media workers that once earned Hong Kong a reputation as a bastion for media excellence in the Asia region”.  About 20 media workers, executives and defenders have been arrested or detained since the implementation of the national security law in June 2020, including high-profile figures such as the Apple Daily founder, Jimmy Lai. In newly published letters from prison, the media mogul and activist said he feared the crackdown would eventually turn Hong Kong into “a cage, like Xinjiang”, where China is accused of incarcerating at least 1 million mostly Muslim minorities and other human rights abuses. The IFJ report detailed the arrests, detentions, forced closures and other direct acts against the media, but also described more insidious efforts, including internal changes at national broadcasters, pro-Beijing media attacks and intimidation, and opacity around ever shifting “red lines” which the media struggled to navigate, as well as tightening restrictions on public records. It said fear and uncertainty now dominated life in Hong Kong, and “there is a now a palpable sense that the fight for democracy and media freedom has entered its endgame”. “We haven’t come to this conclusion easily; it’s deeply concerning we’ve come to this point,” IFJ’s Asia Pacific director, Jane Worthington, told the Guardian. “It’s changing the whole reporting map of Asia, what is happening in Hong Kong. It’s shuffling everything around.” Since the introduction of the national security law, some foreign journalists have left, or been denied visas. The New York Times shifted staff to Seoul, while Initium Media decamped its headquarters to Singapore, and several journalists forced to leave China were unable to resettle in Hong Kong and have set up in Taiwan. There were, however, fewer options for Hong Kong journalists, Worthington said. The IFJ said journalists who chose to move overseas would need support from foreign governments – akin to the UK’s pathways for Hongkongers – to continue their work in exile. “We have a real argument that they are persecuted,” Worthington said. “Not all will have the economic circumstances to move themselves and their families … They need pathways.” Of the media workers and defenders who had been detained, at least 12 had been charged with national security or other offences, including Lai. Arrested in August 2020, Lai has been in prison since December 2020, on remand and then serving sentences for a number of convictions while also awaiting trial on national security charges. In excerpts from prison letters written in late 2021, to be published in the March issue of Index on Censorship magazine, Lai railed against the government assault on freedom of the press and speech, and said he was relying on his faith as a source of strength while in jail. Writing after Apple Daily’s closure, Lai said the “barbaric suppression” of Beijing and the Hong Kong government had worked, and quieted the population. “But the muted anger they have is not going away. Even those emigrating will have it forever,” he said. “This Apple Daily shutdown only aggravates it, making it certain to people that the hopelessness of Hong Kong is irreversible. The more barbaric [the] treatment of Hong Kong people, [the] greater is their anger, and power of their potential resistance; [the] greater is the distrust of Beijing, of Hong Kong, [the] stricter is their rule to control. The vicious circle of suppression-anger-and-distrust eventually will turn Hong Kong into a prison, a cage, like Xinjiang. World, cry for Hong Kong people.” He also expressed some guilt over the suffering of his jailed fellow executives, in particular the chief editor, Lo Wai Kong. “It would be disingenuous to say that by creating Apple Daily I have put him in this situation,” he wrote. “But I do have a guilty feeling and want to share his price of his cross, which is weighing too heavily on him.” A few months later he wrote to staff in Canada. “There is always a price to pay when you put truth, justice and goodness ahead of your own comfort, safety and physical wellbeing, or your life becomes a lie,” he said. “I choose truth instead of a lie and pay the price.”",News/World news,Hong Kong democracy and media freedom has ‘entered endgame’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/hong-kong-democracy-and-media-freedom-has-entered-endgame
2/11/2022,"Here is a romcom whose chief impact is the pure Twilight Zone weirdness of realising that it could have been made at any time in the last 20 years with the same lead actors: the luxuriously preserved Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson. The borrowings from Richard Curtis are of the same general vintage and the closing credits deliver a cutesy and unearned homage to the faux-genuine couple testimonies from When Harry Met Sally. With her legendary radioactive humourlessness, Lopez plays Kat, a singer with a gigantic social media following poised to bring off the publicity coup of the millennium: she is going to perform her massive hit, Marry Me, with her fiance Bastian (played by Colombian music star Maluma) after which they will get married on stage in front of a live global audience. But just as she is about to go on, everyone’s phones are alive with the scandalous news that Bastian has cheated on her.  Piteously alone, Kat sees Charlie (Wilson) in the crowd: an adorable single dad and math teacher who happens at that moment to be holding the “Marry Me” placard that his tween daughter Lou (Chloe Coleman), a massive Kat fan, has brought with her. Impulsively, defiantly, Kat beckons this sensitive everyman up on stage; the lovably bewildered guy complies (for his awestruck daughter’s sake, natch) and the ceremony goes ahead. They know it’s just a stunt – and yet Charlie’s real, ordinary life and genuine values entrance lonely Kat as they get to know each other. Will they get married for real? Or will Kat be tempted back to the world of super-rich celebrity and leave poor Charlie in his civilian slum of yucky non-famousness? Everything about the film is machine-tooled and algorithmically calculated, right down to the chilling refusal to talk about Lou’s mother (who cares, right?) and the fact that Charlie has been given a lovable dog. Wilson is so robotically bland that in 20 or 100 years’ time I fully expect Marry Me to be remade starring the if-anything-younger-looking Jen and Owen.

2/11/2022,"The Sky Is Everywhere, Apple TV+ and A24’s adaptation of Jandy Nelson’s 2010 young adult novel, often gives what could be a rote exploration of grief the sheen of a fairy tale. Seventeen-year-old Lennie Walker (Grace Kaufman) lives in a colorful house in a northern California redwood forest surrounded by ancient trees and her Gram’s (Cherry Jones) sweet-smelling roses. A talented clarinetist, her forays into the woods are soundtracked by classical jazz; the wind carries off her poems and letters, written on leaves or looseleaf paper. There once were two sisters who explored together, she narrates, and minutes into the film, there remains only one, after the death of Lennie’s beloved older sister Bailey (Havana Rose Liu) from a heart arrhythmia – the same condition that killed their mother when they were children – at the age of 19.  In less capable hands, this catastrophic loss could become the single dominant element of the film, the sap that overwhelms everywhere else. But through the eyes of Josephine Decker, the film-maker behind the experimental theater trip Madeline’s Madeline and the perversely surprising, deeply under-appreciated psychodrama Shirley, adolescent grief becomes something more confounding, sensual, spiky. Decker infuses Nelson’s screenplay with a potent dose of whimsical fantasy, morphing Lennie’s tortuous bereavement into a lonely house, a romantic musical journey and a garden where other complicated, confusing emotions grow. Those emotions mostly pertain to the boys who fill the gaps in Lennie’s life as she returns to school after an absence. There’s Toby (Pico Alexander), Bailey’s boyfriend, whom Lennie both resents as the person who took Bailey’s time in life and covets as the only person who understands her pain in death. And then there’s Joe (Jacques Colimon), a new student and fellow musician, the only person who can coax Lennie out of her grief-addled musical funk and to whom Lennie is immediately attracted. The classic love triangle could feel derivative if not for Kaufman’s fine-tuned performance, Decker’s focus on Lennie’s emotional rollercoaster, and the specificity with which each male character matches her yearning to live and return to herself in spite of crushing loss, like two opposite ends of a puzzle piece. It’s familiar territory; To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, Netflix’s hit YA adaptation which spawned its own trilogy and in-house stars, similarly follows a younger sister in the shadow of an absent older one (though at college, not dead) in the shadow of loss, but with a more poppy, heartthrob bent. The Sky is Everywhere has a nerdier sensibility – Lennie is a band geek obsessed with Wuthering Heights – which, combined with Decker’s atmospheric, off-kilter style, feels fresh. As in Shirley, Decker’s homage to midcentury horror legend Shirley Jackson which bent the rules of a literary biopic by placing the author in her own plot, The Sky is Everywhere flirts with the conventions of YA through elaborate flourishes of magical realism. A sequence in which Joe and Lennie bond over Bach becomes a fantasy ballet of flower-adorned nymphs. Music floats characters in the air. Lennie’s fortress of grief comes alive as a house no one else can enter, a storm no one else can see or feel. Heightened sound effects – rustling wind, humming crickets, buzzing flies, a springing sound to indicate arousal – effectively bring Lennie’s interior experience closer to our own. The film is strongest in its examination of the emotional scramble of grief, actions that far outpace the characters’ ability to process or understand them. Compared with scenes between Lennie and Joe, which are surprisingly sensuous and sexy (in an accurate teenage way, not an adults cosplaying teenage way), scenes between Lennie and Toby are raw, jagged. In one sequence, Decker interweaves Lennie’s visceral memory of Bailey’s open casket with one of kissing Toby, soundtracked by the tinnitus of an aftershock instead of the usual classical score by Caroline Shaw. It’s provocative, transgressive material, how thoroughly tangled these wires of grief and lust have become, without being salacious or incendiary. Decker’s deftness in exploring these thornier, misunderstood feelings renders some of the more melodramatic moments (the secret engagement of a teenager, a pregnancy reveal) off-key, too bold. Similarly, Lennie’s vivid interiority is in stark contrast to several other thinly sketched characters, such as Lennie’s stoner uncle Big (Jason Segel), little more than a stock hippie, best friend Sarah (Ji-young Yoo), a fellow band geek whose support Lennie mostly rebuffs, and one-dimensional mean girl Rachel (Julia Schlaepfer), Lennie’s band rival. Even Bailey, invoked so often, is mostly a spectral memory. These are off notes in a mostly absorbing symphony of aftermath, one that lands at a message you’d expect: that grief is horrific but endurable, that life goes on, that the only way forward is through. The journey to that point, and the only reasonable resolution to the love triangle, is a surprisingly enjoyable one – an emotional arc that honors the beautiful strangeness of teenage feelings more than its inherent drama, even after the worst happens.

When he was six years old the family moved to Bonby in north Lincolnshire, where Dan attended Worlaby primary school and Brigg comprehensive. In 1994 he studied for a biochemistry degree at Bangor University, Gwynedd.  Dan began his career as a laboratory technician in the products support team with Diagnostics Products Corporation in Llanberis, Gwynedd. When DPC merged with Siemens in 2006, Dan joined the Healthineers research and development team, rising to team leader in 2021. Here his reputation grew as an effective listener who advised clients both in the UK and worldwide. He was in his element when it came to analysing and understanding data, acquiring the nickname Data Dan. On one occasion, during a team bonding weekend in the Lake District, he prepared a curry supper while dressed as a character from Star Wars to add an element of fun to the gathering. Dan loved his work and his achievements were regularly recognised with commendations at Siemens, though he was always modest, saying he was just doing his job. His smile lit up a room, he was popular with colleagues and was always prepared to help and support others. No task was too small. He continued to work throughout the pandemic, supporting NHS laboratories and working in hospitals across the UK and Ireland. Dan met Jo Mitchell, a project officer at Bangor University, in 2005, and together they moved to Y Felinheli, where they enjoyed entertaining family and friends – his barbecues and curries were famous. He also developed an interest in organic vegetable gardening and they soon were almost self-sufficient in vegetables. In his spare time Dan was a badminton player, angler and cyclist, and enjoyed nothing more than walking with Jo in his beloved north Wales. Many family gatherings were spent around the dining table discussing politics and social issues. Dan was a Labour party supporter and an avid Guardian reader. He had a sense of social justice that was reflected in his actions to help others. Jo survives him, as do Pat and I, his brother, Gareth, and his nephew, Owen.",News/Business,Dan Evans obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/10/dan-evans-obituary
2/11/2022,"My wife, Valerie Letcher, who has died after a heart valve operation aged 80, was an academic who wrote extensively on pioneering British female novelists and commentators in South Africa and Canada. In particular, she highlighted the contributions of Harriet Ward (writing from the Cape between 1842 and 1848) and the Munro sisters (Georgina and Isabella). Valerie, who spent most of her career in South Africa, was a member of the Black Sash movement in the 1980s, whose members would line up outside political meetings or in the street, wearing their black sashes, after racist legislation had been passed by the nationalist government of the time.  Born in Durban, Valerie was the daughter of Jack Fann, a road engineer, and Violet (nee Galagher), a homemaker. After attending Girls’ Collegiate, Pietermaritzburg, she studied English at Natal University Pietermaritzburg, graduating in 1962, and then took an education diploma. She travelled to the UK for a year to teach English at Ashford school in Kent, and in 1965 began a teaching post at Durban high school. She and I met in Durban and married in 1967. We spent two years in Bristol while I was a researcher there at the university. Moving back to South Africa, we lived in Johannesburg and then Grahamstown and finally Durban. We also spent short periods in the UK, in Oxford, Exeter, London and Bath. It was in Grahamstown that Val spent 10 years as a staunch member of the Black Sash movement, opposing apartheid. In 1990 Val became a lecturer in English at Edgewood College of Education, Natal University. As an educator she was committed to social justice and wherever she encountered racial prejudice among students, she felt compelled to teach them a better way of living. She chose texts that challenged and provoked – a favourite was Ursula Le Guin’s novel The Left Hand of Darkness. At the same time, she was studying for her PhD, which she completed in 1996, on the subject of Ward, a British writer often mistaken for a South African. Her work on Ward, the Munro sisters and other female British writers of the 19th century was published in journals throughout her time in Grahamstown, and after she retired in 2000. We settled in Stratton on the Fosse, in Somerset, in 2003. Val’s retirement life revolved around walking (with the Mendip Ramblers), book clubs, reading, writing, gardening and entertaining friends and relatives. Val was the consummate homemaker and wonderful mother to our three children. She was also a superb host. Her love of poetry was a mainstay of her intellectual life and many dinner parties were enlivened by a quotation from a guest that was completed by Val and vice versa. She is survived by our children, Catherine, Christopher and Sarah, two grandchildren, Amy and Finn, her sister, Felicity, and me.",News/Education,Valerie Letcher obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/10/valerie-letcher-obituary
2/11/2022,"The Aston Martin drivers Sebastian Vettel and Lance Stroll have criticised Formula One for putting entertainment before the sport at last season’s controversial and decisive Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. The drivers accused the FIA and F1 of poor judgment in the decision-making that cost Lewis Hamilton the title. Max Verstappen won the championship at Abu Dhabi, having overtaken Hamilton on the final lap after the race director, Michael Masi, intervened and improvised with the rules governing the safety car and lapped cars. It remains a highly contentious decision.  F1 and the teams are known not to want races to end behind the safety car but Stroll and Vettel, speaking at the launch of their new Aston Martin AMR22 car, believed the objective of ensuring a dramatic finale was given greater weight than the integrity of the sport. “Abu Dhabi was just not right, the rules are the rules,” said Stroll. “When there is a safety car lapped cars get to overtake the safety car and then we go racing. There is nothing that says half the cars can overtake and half have to stay behind. Those things can’t be modified during a race just to put on a show. “The rules are the rules. You can’t be modifying the rules for entertainment, it has to be sport first. I don’t think it’s right what happened in Abu Dhabi.” Vettel, a four-time champion, concurred with his disquiet that F1 had lost a sense of perspective in Abu Dhabi but sympathised with Masi and the difficult position he was holding in trying to ensure the GP finished under racing conditions. “The main thing is that we focus on the sport and not so much on the show,” said Vettel. “The main thing is there is clarity in what’s happening in these sort of situations and there are no questions asked any more. “For Michael it has been a pity. There are two interests clashing: one is the sport and the other is the show. I don’t care so much about the show because I look at it as a sport and from a competitive point of view. Michael has been very focused and determined to do a good job. I don’t know what is in store for his future but I hope he sticks around because overall he has done a very good job.” The FIA’s investigation into the events will present its findings to the teams on Monday 14 February. Aston Martin, under the billionaire owner Lawrence Stroll, have a five-year plan to be challenging for race wins and titles. As well as major investment they have reshuffled their management setup, with their former team principal, Otmar Szafnauer, being replaced by Mike Krack, who has held senior roles with BMW and the Le Mans-winning Porsche team.",Sport/Sport,Vettel and Stroll criticise F1 for putting ‘entertainment’ ahead of rules in finale,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/10/f1-put-entertainment-ahead-of-rules-in-abu-dhabi-finale-say-sebastian-vettel-and-lance-stroll
2/11/2022,"Things haven’t gone right for poor old Sunderland for quite a while now. Since 1939, in fact, when Germany invaded Poland to set off an unfortunate chain of events that robbed their league-and-cup-winning superstar Raich Carter of what would surely have been his best years and culminated in his transfer to Derby County. Sunderland’s immediate post-war ‘Bank of England’ spending spree produced a trophy haul of no trophies, and while the 1973 cup win provided brief respite from the relentless misery, things quickly became so grindingly dull again that even the 1981 arrival of national treasure / people’s sunbeam Ally McCoist couldn’t cheer anyone up.  So it’s fair to say they’ve been trending steadily to the point we find them today. Upon somehow managing, back in 2018, to get themselves relegated to the third tier for the first time in their history without any of Lawrie McMenemy’s help, the club – and indeed most neutral observers – blithely assumed they’d be back in the One Below The Big Time before anyone knew it. But here we are, years later, two-thirds of the way through a fourth consecutive League One season, and currently on a run of form – a 6-0 defeat at Bolton followed by losses to bottom team Doncaster and struggling Cheltenham – that is hinting at making even a play-off berth look like a pipe dream. Having briskly cashiered Lee Johnson through the door marked Away The Lad, Sunderland have been desperately seeking someone to knock heads together quicksmart. To this end, they asked Roy Keane to reprise his largely successful stint at the Stadium of Light back in the day. However, contractual negotiations between Keane and owner Kyril Louis-Dreyfus broke down, farcical scenes presumably brought to an end with mouth pops and a slap-bass sting in honour of Julia, Kyril’s second cousin twice removed. Sunderland now have to decide between Alex Neil, Grant McCann, Sabri Lamouchi and [Fiver squints, adjusts pince-nez] Neil Lennon. They’d better get it done soon, too, because a fifth year in League One looms large. Oh Raich! If only you knew it would eventually come to this.

I was signing these guys on Football Manager two months earlier” – Stoke City’s Harry Souttar gets his chat on with Ewan Murray about flamin’ knack and improving club fortunes. “Given that two sponsors of West Ham have now pulled the plug over ‘cat-flap’, isn’t it time that the UK government re-thought its outrageously generous stadium deal with the club too?” – Alex Folkes. “This week, Dion Dublin said on Match of the Day of Wout Weghorst: ‘He’s a big old unit that you would expect not to do what he does.’ I can’t see HABOUTYWENTDWHD replacing GTFABM any time soon” – Matt Clift. “Poor James A Garfield.

Portland Timbers midfielder Andy Polo has been suspended and prohibited from all team activities pending an investigation into allegations of domestic violence made against him. Brazilian police have arrested a man they believe hacked into Neymar’s bank accounts and repeatedly stole small sums of money. “What did this lad do?” said Fabio Pinheiro Lopes, in charge of the case. “He got the password of his office colleague and stole small amounts of money from famous people with high net worth.” Spurs have called on their supporters to “move on” from using the word “Yid” after concluding a review with fans’ focus groups. As mentioned, a second West Ham sponsor has garnered fresh publicity by pulling its support of the club after the Kurt Zouma cat business, while brother Yoan has been sidelined by Dagenham & Redbridge for his role in it all. When asked by a reporter if his Hammers teammate should be sacked, Michail Antonio replied with a question of his own: “Do you think what he’s done is worse than racism? I’m not condoning a thing that he’s done – I don’t agree with what he’s done at all – but there are people who have been caught for racism and have played football afterwards. They got punished, they got an eight-game punishment or something like that, but people are now calling for people to be sacked, to lose their livelihood. I’ve just got to ask this question to everyone out there: is what he’s done worse?” Brighton boss Graham Potter doesn’t feel too down after technical director Dan Ashworth headed off for gardening leave/Newcastle. “Of course I am disappointed, Dan was a colleague, a friend – someone I respect a lot,” tooted Potter. “He’s been an important person at the club, but these things happen, it’s life.” And after James Rowe did one from Chesterfield, having been suspended pending an investigation into allegations of misconduct, Paul Cook has returned to the club as manager.

2/11/2022,"Snoop Dogg is being sued for the alleged sexual assault and battery of a woman in California in 2013, Pitchfork reports. The anonymous woman – an actor, model and dancer – said that after attending a Snoop Dogg concert on 29 May 2013, the rapper’s associate Bishop Don “Magic” Juan offered her a ride home, but that she fell asleep in the car and was taken to his home against her will. The following morning, Juan allegedly “removed his penis from his pants and forced his penis into her mouth”.  The next day, Juan allegedly took the woman to Snoop Dogg’s studio to see if he would hire her for a role on a television show. According to the lawsuit, the rapper cornered her as she was using the toilet, forced her into oral sex and then “proceeded to masturbate and ejaculated on [the woman]’s upper chest and lower neck”. The lawsuit stated that she did not get the television job because she “refused to willingly and enthusiastically give oral sex”. The woman, known as Jane Doe, is suing Snoop Dogg, AKA Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr, for a violation of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, sexual battery and sexual assault. Juan is also named in the lawsuit. The Guardian has contacted representatives of Snoop Dogg for comment. He deleted an Instagram post in which he wrote: “Gold digger season is here … be careful nefews [his name for fans] … keep ya guards up … And. Keep ya circle small”.

2/11/2022,"Of all the great achievements of the 1945 Labour government, one stands out on the world stage. The NHS may have the greatest impact on our daily lives, but it is the creation of Nato that ushered in what is now approaching three-quarters of a century of peace between the nations of Europe. Prime Minister Clement Attlee played a vital role in bringing together this unprecedented alliance of democracies. Then, as now, the promise that an attack on one member would be considered as an attack on all formed the foundation of British security policy. As such, Labour’s commitment to Nato is unshakable.  That commitment is more important than ever today. The threat to Ukraine is real and pressing. More than 130,000 Russian troops menace its border. Russian combat battalions, tank divisions and air squadrons have massed, flaunting their capability of a full-scale invasion. For now, Putin’s final intentions are uncertain; the flexing and threatening of Russia’s destructive capacity are not. The prospect of a bloody and unjust war looms over Ukraine. It was to prevent such needless wars that the generation of Attlee and his foreign secretary, the formidable trade union leader Ernest Bevin, were the midwives of Nato. With the failures of appeasement and the spectre of Munich fresh in their minds, they knew that the best way to preserve peace is to show that you are prepared to stand up to aggression. Indeed, on the day the treaty bringing Nato into being was signed, Bevin spoke of the new alliance as “a consecration of peace and resistance to aggression”. Now, as the integrity of a sovereign nation on our continent of Europe stands in peril, those words are as sacrosanct as ever. That Bevinite internationalism will guide Labour’s approach to Britain’s security every day of my leadership. Nobody wants war. At first glance, some on the left may be sympathetic to those siren voices who condemn Nato. But to condemn Nato is to condemn the guarantee of democracy and security it brings, and which our allies in eastern and central Europe are relying on, as the sabre-rattling from Moscow grows ever louder. That’s why the likes of the Stop the War coalition are not benign voices for peace. At best they are naive; at worst they actively give succour to authoritarian leaders who directly threaten democracies. There is nothing progressive in showing solidarity with the aggressor when our allies need our solidarity and – crucially – our practical assistance, now more than ever. The kneejerk reflex, “Britain, Canada, the United States, France – wrong; their enemies – right”, is unthinking conservatism at its worst. To truly stop war, you need to show you are serious about standing up for peace, that you are serious about keeping your promises to your friends, and that you will always stand up to those who threaten. Another giant of the Labour movement, Denis Healey, as Labour’s international secretary in 1947, wrote the pamphlet Cards on the Table, which demolished the argument of those on the left that Britain could somehow be a third force, aligned neither with the Americans nor the Soviets. Attlee, Bevin and Healey saw communism for what it was, and were prepared to stand up to its aggression. Today’s Labour party has the same clear-eyed view of the current regime in the Kremlin. We know, as they did, that bullies respect only strength. Russian tanks sit, engines revving, on the verge of annexing Ukraine, but protest placards waved here by the usual suspects condemn Nato, not Moscow. Any equating of the right of a sovereign nation to determine its own future, even to exist, and the vicious aggression of a neighbour is an intellectual sham. To do so is not merely misguided: it is morally wrong. There is no equivalence between a defensive alliance that has never provoked conflict and those who would inflict the appalling cost of war on to others. Moscow’s hard-line leadership won’t see a rally on the streets of Britain as a reason to pull its tanks from Ukraine’s borders. All it will see is naivety and weakness – virtue signallers in the west providing a smokescreen so it can go on beating up and jailing those brave individuals who dare to stand up to its despotism on the streets of Russia. That is why I came to Nato headquarters to be briefed by its secretary general, the former Labour prime minister of Norway, Jens Stoltenberg, on how the alliance can stand together in the face of unnecessary threats from Moscow. And that is why Labour is standing by the UK government’s approach to standing united with our allies in the face of aggression abroad. It is also why Labour is adamant that the government must do far more to stand up to the threat from the Russian regime at home. Under a decade of Conservative rule, London has become the home of international money laundering, where kleptocrats and criminals come to clean their dirty money of its stains. This isn’t just an issue of financial crime, it’s an issue of national security. Dark money and influence leaves the mark of weakness and shame on our country, and it must be scrubbed clean. Labour strongly backs an economic crime bill to create a proper register of overseas entities in property and asset ownership, reform of Companies House to give it a regulatory function, and the rapid implementation of the sensible recommendations in the recent report on Russia by parliament’s intelligence and security committee. By dragging its feet and refusing to take immediate action against dirty money at home, when it has the levers in its hands, the Johnson administration is weakening Britain’s moral and practical leadership abroad. We won’t let up in pressing it to end this prevarication. When Bevin and the representatives of the other free nations designed the alliance one principle was paramount. No nation can be pressed into joining Nato, and no nation can be prevented from doing so by bullying and brinkmanship from others. Each new member joins for their own independent reasons, and each application is judged on its own merits by existing Nato members. That principle remains right and fair. The pandemic has underlined again how today’s great challenges can only be tackled by action on a global scale. While they affect us individually, their very nature demands that they are solved collectively. We must be relentless in working together with our international partners to tackle global poverty, future health crises and climate change. Nato is just one part of the rules-based international system that allows for collective action, but it is a vital one. It should be supported, and its resolve strengthened, not undermined by ill thought-out opposition. That is why Labour’s support for Nato remains as unwavering today as it was when we played an instrumental part in its formation. And that is why I regard both the Ns – Nato and the NHS – as legacies of that transformational Labour government that we need to be proud of and to protect.

2/11/2022,"As China began to organise hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics one problem started to emerge – they had automatically qualified for the ice hockey competition, yet they didn’t have a team. The solution? Phoning around to put together a squad of ringers from scratch. And so on Thursday, when they made their debut at the Games in Beijing, facing the might of a historically successful United States team, the China roster included players like 32-year-old American-Chinese goaltender Jeremy Smith from Dearborn in Michigan, listed as Jieruimi Shimisi. Likewise, Jieke Kailiaosi is better recognised by his friends in Chicago where he was born as Jake Chelios.  More than half of the 25 players in China’s squad were born or grew up in North America. Smith told ESPN he had been surprised to get a call inviting him to join a team in Beijing that could lead to an Olympic place. “If you’re joking,” he told his agent, “I’m waiting for the punchline.” The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) permits players to represent a country if they have lived and played in a league there for two years, and have transferred to the new national association. So, in order to bond them together as a team – and ensure eligibility for the Games – players were contracted to a new Chinese club. In 2016 HC Kunlun Red Star entered the Kontinental Hockey League, a mostly Russian competition that also features clubs from Belarus, Finland and Latvia among others. China itself has no professional league, and the plan was hatched to avoid Chinese embarrassment on the international stage. They have not fared well over their six seasons, reaching the play-offs only once. In the last three years they have won fewer than 40 of their 170 matches in regulation time. Things got so bad that late last year the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and IIHF discussed dropping China’s team from the Games, fearing they would be overwhelmed. “Watching a team being beaten 15-0 is not good for anyone, not for China or for ice hockey” said the IIHF president Luc Tardif. Domestic fans have also not all taken kindly to the move. Social media posts have questioned their commitment and their qualifications to be Chinese. A typical post on social media site Weibo attached an image of the squad, with user kaixinwanmao saying “If you didn’t tell me, I wouldn’t know this was China’s men’s ice hockey team.” Covid had a twist in the Olympics ice hockey tale though. The US team that China faced in their opening match had also been significantly weakened. In December it was announced that the NHL would not be sending players to the Olympics, with Commissioner Gary Bettman saying it was “no longer feasible” after the NHL season itself had been disrupted. In their first ever Winter Olympics match China nearly took a shock lead after three minutes of the first period. It took 11 minutes for the US to break the deadlock. But after that the game unfolded very much as expected, with the final result going 8-0 to the Americans. It may be that sporting success will determine the extent to which fans accept athletes representing China at these Games with dual heritage. San Francisco-born Eileen Gu, who has already secured one gold medal and will compete for two more, has proved hugely popular domestically and become one of the faces of the Chinese team in their home Games. However, she has been repeatedly questioned about what this means for her citizenship – China does not permit dual nationality ordinarily. Goaltender Smith clarified to reporters in Beijing ahead of his Olympic ice hockey debut that “I did not renounce my citizenship, they never asked me to.” It might be an unconventional way to assemble a team, but it has given an Olympic shot to those who never thought they would have one. The Vancouver-born 36-year-old Brandon Yip plays right wing in the squad, and last featured in the top-level NHL in 2014. “I knew I wasn’t making Team Canada, that’s for sure,” he quipped. After their opening defeat by the US, the task facing the ice hockey team representing China doesn’t get any easier. Their next matches are on Saturday against Germany, ranked fifth in the world, and on Sunday against Canada, ranked No 1.",Sport/Sport,Reality bites for China’s ice hockey ringers on Winter Olympic debut,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/10/reality-bites-for-chinas-ice-hockey-ringers-on-winter-olympic-debut
2/11/2022,"Germany’s foreign minister is facing domestic criticism over her surprise decision to recruit the head of Greenpeace as an international environmental envoy, including accusations she bent the rules to create the post and had obscured the divide between governing and lobbying. Annalena Baerbock described Jennifer Morgan, the outgoing head of Greenpeace International, as “the new navigator at the helm of our international climate policy” when she announced her appointment earlier this week.  As a future state secretary under Baerbock, Morgan is set to coordinate Germany’s €6bn (£5bn) international climate initiative across all the government ministries. The initiative includes supporting projects in newly industrialised countries. She will also represent Germany at international climate conferences, the next being the United Nations’ meeting in Sharm el-Sheik in November. Morgan, who starts the role on 1 March, will work across the government but is expected to have particularly close contact with Baerbock’s fellow Green party member, Robert Habeck, who is the minister for economics and climate protection, and Steffi Lemke, the environment minister, whose role includes conservation, consumer protection and nuclear safety. The appointment of Morgan will help broaden the remit of her own ministry, Baerbock said on Wednesday. She added that Germany’s 226 diplomatic missions abroad were, by extension, “climate ambassadors” and would be included in her effort to place climate politics at the heart of German foreign policy. But Morgan must first become a German citizen in order to become a state secretary. This, Baerbock said, was in the process of happening, but has prompted stiff opposition in conservative circles amid fears that a US citizen is not capable of representing German interests. She will reportedly receive a salary in line with that earned by bureaucrats of a similar rank, of almost €15,000 a month. Morgan will have to also undergo a security check by Germany’s intelligence services, with some critics suggesting it may be difficult for her to distance herself from Greenpeace protest initiatives where its activists have clashed with the law. Politicians from the opposition conservative alliance have led the condemnation. Thorsten Frei, a member of the Christian Social Union, called the decision hypocritical. He said: “To make a Greenpeace activist state secretary with the wink of an eye does not tally with the recent standards announced by parliament to more clearly identify the influence of interest groups. To grant citizenship and the status of civil servant to a prominent American lobbyist on the quick is a highly idiosyncratic event.” Alexander Dobrindt, head of the parliamentary group of the Christian Social Union, said the government was opening itself up to manipulation. “That international lobbyists regardless of the topic, are allowed to take over the leadership of government ministries I find surprising, even for this government,” he said. Lukas Köhler, vice-chair of the parliamentary group of the pro-business FDP, part of the three-way coalition government alongside the Greens and the Social Democrats, told Handelsblatt that the general public had reacted “with a degree of astonishment” because of what he called Greenpeace’s “radical views” and its involvement in some activist events in Germany in recent years that had been seen to backfire. Transparency International, the anti-corruption organisation which is based in Berlin, said it saw the appointment as largely unproblematic as the goal behind it was a transparent one, to advance climate protection in the foreign ministry. “For that you clearly need experts,” its chair, Hartmut Bäumer, told the news network RND. “This isn’t about financial advantages for Greenpeace, rather about moral concerns. That is the difference from other organisations for whom financial lobbyism is the priority.” But TI’s managing director, Anna-Maija Mertens, said the organisation would monitor the way in which Morgan carried out her role. “Of course Jennifer Morgan has to ensure she maintains a broad, balanced weighing up of interests…,” Mertens said. Ever since her own appointment two months ago, Baerbock, who has been mainly focused on tackling high-level crises such as the standoff between Russia and the west over Ukraine, has stressed the importance of broadening the remit of her ministry to include environmental affairs. She has quashed the expectation that she would be forced against her will to water down her commitment to green issues in order to concentrate on the wide range of pressing diplomatic concerns. There had been speculation she had been effectively sidelined in the role of foreign minister because of a worse-than-predicted performance in September’s election over negative publicity stemming from plagiarism allegations. While she has earned a mixed response for her diplomatic efforts to tackle tensions over the Ukraine border, the role has caused her international profile to soar. Speaking in fluent German, Morgan said at a press briefing in Berlin on Wednesday morning that she had lived in the city since 2003 and that her “heart beats for Germany”. Greenpeace’s reputation in Germany was damaged when a protest by one of its activists went spectacularly wrong before Germany’s Euro 2020 match against France. A man lost control of his paraglider as he attempted to fly over the Allianz Arena in Munich. Two people were injured. Officials said the paraglider narrowly escaped getting shot down by marksmen. The stunt was widely condemned as reckless, including by the Green party, and Greenpeace later apologised. Jan-Marco Luczak of the FDP said that, as head of Greenpeace, Morgan should be “held responsible for such life-threatening and punishable initiatives”.",News/World news,German foreign minister faces criticism after appointing ex-Greenpeace chief ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/german-foreign-minister-faces-criticism-after-appointing-ex-greenpeace-chief
2/11/2022,"Keir Starmer has launched an outspoken attack on the Stop the War coalition, in which Jeremy Corbyn is a leading figure, effectively accusing the campaign group of siding with Russia against Nato. In an opinion article for the Guardian, penned on the way to Brussels where he reaffirmed Labour’s staunch support for Nato, Starmer says Stop the War are “not benign voices for peace”.  “At best they are naive, at worst they actively give succour to authoritarian leaders who directly threaten democracies. There is nothing progressive in showing solidarity with the aggressor when our allies need our solidarity and – crucially – our practical assistance now more than ever,” he said. He said Putin’s regime would see Stop the War protesters in the UK as “virtue signallers” who were “providing a smokescreen so it can go on beating up and jailing those brave individuals that dare to stand up to its despotism on the streets of Russia”. He accused the group of a “kneejerk reflex: Britain, Canada, the United States, France – wrong; their enemies – right”. Corbyn is the deputy president of the Stop the War coalition, alongside Andrew Murray, who was chief of staff to the former Unite leader Len McCluskey. Murray is a former communist who only joined Labour when Corbyn became leader. The group’s president is the musician Brian Eno. Stop the War was founded in the run-up to the Iraq conflict, and regularly holds rallies on issues including Israel and Palestine. But its critics claim it is not just anti-war, but anti-west. Stop the War is holding an online rally on Thursday evening, with the title No War in Ukraine: Stop Nato Expansion. Speakers include Corbyn himself, as well as the Labour MP Diane Abbott. Starmer said: “Nobody wants war. At first glance some on the left may be sympathetic to those siren voices who condemn Nato. But to condemn Nato is to condemn the guarantee of democracy and security it brings and which our allies in eastern and central Europe are relying on as the sabre-rattling from Moscow grows ever louder.” Starmer has repeatedly distanced himself from Corbyn, who is currently sitting as an independent MP after having the whip removed over his response to a critical Equality and Human Rights Commission report on Labour’s handling of antisemitism complaints. Unless he is allowed back into the fold, Corbyn will not be able to stand as a Labour candidate at the next general election. Friends have suggested he could stand as an independent. Starmer, as he travelled to Nato on the same day as the prime minister – a rare show of unity amid political turmoil at Westminster over the lockdown parties scandal – sought to place himself in a line of senior Labour figures, including the postwar foreign secretary Ernest Bevin, who took a tough line with Soviet Russia. “Attlee, Healey and Bevin saw communism for what it was and were prepared to stand up to its aggression,” he said. “Today’s Labour party has the same clear-eyed view of the current regime in the Kremlin. “We know, as they did, that bullies only respect strength. Russian tanks sit, engines revving, on the verge of annexing Ukraine but protest placards waved here by the usual suspects condemn Nato not Moscow.” Corbyn shocked many Labour backbenchers in the aftermath of the Salisbury poisoning in 2018, when he declined to attribute responsibility for the attacks to Moscow without “incontrovertible evidence”. Some Labour strategists believe this apparent ambivalence over Russia’s role was a key reason for the public scepticism about Corbyn’s leadership that contributed to Labour’s disastrous performance at the 2019 general election. However, Corbyn’s supporters blame highly critical media reporting of the then Labour leader, as well as the debilitating parliamentary battle over Brexit that divided the party.",News/Politics,Keir Starmer accuses Stop the War coalition of siding with Nato’s enemies,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/10/keir-starmer-says-stop-the-war-coalition-gives-help-to-authoritarians-like-putin
2/11/2022,"When I think of Joe Rogan, a range of unpalatable things spring to mind: supplements, MMA, Jordan Peterson, pro wrestling, cannabis … and now vaccine misinformation. Rogan is also the most successful podcaster on Earth with around 11 million listeners per episode. What is his appeal?  Stepping out of my echo chamber and into Joe Rogan’s world, I want to find out by living the Joe Rogan Experience for the next five days – consuming no other media except for his podcast. HOLY HELL. These podcasts are long! Rogan releases three to four podcasts per week, with an average length of two hours and 35 minutes per episode. Listening to every single episode of The Joe Rogan Experience nonstop would take about 211 days or just over half a year. Scrolling through more than a thousand episodes on Spotify, I decide to listen to a mix of random thinkers and pundits and some of the more controversial podcasts that lead to him dominating the headlines this week. I start with an author selected at random. Michael Pollan is a journalist and Rogan is interviewing him about his new book on plant medicine. I intend to listen to Rogan while I do housework, but this podcast is really interesting and jammed with information. You can’t take it in while multitasking. I sit, listen and learn a few things: Moses might have been stoned when he came across the burning bush; the Greeks probably took psychedelics with their wine when celebrating Dionysius; and the PCR test we all take for Covid detection was invented by a guy high on LSD. Rogan himself is a good facilitator. He talks (and is fluent in drug bro talk) but not too much, and gives his guest a good opportunity to expand on his work. The questions are intelligent and Rogan comes across as curious and engaged. I meet a friend for a walk and tell her about Rogan. She shudders and warns me not to get red-pilled. As if! I drop by another friend’s house. Nick has listened to a bit of Joe Rogan who he describes as “a dumb person’s idea of a smart person”. I do not tell him I think Rogan’s smart. I wake up and start listening to Rogan before I get out of bed. This episode is one with his friend Duncan Trussell. I watch the video of them talking and they appear to be in a cave with lots of candles. I don’t know who Trussell is and I find their conversation hard to follow and boring. Lacking a central topic like the Pollan one, it’s too discursive. They are talking about Taiwan, about some wrestler I’ve never heard of called John Cena, and crypto. I fall asleep for a bit and wake up and they are still talking about crypto. Abandon this one and switch to an episode featuring a libertarian and comedian Dave Smith. Have not heard of Smith. Get out of bed. Do yoga while listening to Smith and Rogan. I’m doing some stretches and some breathing exercises but it’s hard to chill as the talk is turning hectic – Iraq, Gaddafi, losing your wallet and not being able to pay for Starbucks, Putin, Ukraine, Bill O’Reilly, Trump saying we’ve killed a lot of people too, Assad, the corporate press (“has lost its monopoly”, “is losing its grip on power”, “no ethics”), how “masks don’t work” and how Americans became totalitarian in 2020. It’s a lot. I keep listening as I walk to a reiki session. “Civil assets swot raid … this shit is insane … ,” says Smith, rapid-fire. In reiki I turn off Rogan and enter an all-white room that is subtly lit and lightly scented with incense. I wonder if I am carrying the jacked-up energy of Rogan with me into the room. In the 90-minute session, I find myself falling into a state of deep relaxation, something very akin to hypnosis. The reiki master is clearing my energy. Is it the dense energy of a three-hour Joe Rogan podcast? In my trance-like state, when I come to, the idea of listening to more Rogan repulses me. But yet – I haven’t even listened to a full episode. I must push on. I listen to more Joe Rogan that evening. (“The left wing and right wing are crazy and spinning out of control.” “We’re on the national suicide watch.” “The centre became the radicals and the radicals lost any centre to gravitate to.”) Still affected by the reiki I wonder if Rogan will start to mess with my subconscious. If the only voice I hear is Joe Rogan’s, what sort of person will I become? Wake up. Listen to Joe Rogan interview author Sebastian Junger. Junger has had an interesting near-death experience but the conversation takes a boring segue and they end up in a pointless cul-de-sac making small talk about the late comedian Robin Williams. I’m tweeting that I’m listening to Joe Rogan and people on my timeline are so anti. They respond “why” and “he’s awful”. But I am not regretting listening. Rogan himself is personable and warm. A friend of mine who is a journalist on a UK news podcasts says, “He’s not what people think he is. On the vaccine he’s super-dumb, but other stuff he is quite reasonable. He has a nice vibe to him.” Go on a foam roller. Pain. Try and distract myself by listening to Joe Rogan interviewing Twitter founder Jack Dorsey. It’s a bit of a soft interview and I don’t really buy Dorsey’s vibe as a rich hippie who just wants the world to talk to each other and solve their problems through his platform. I see some friends for dinner. I notice I am introducing a lot of conversations with: “I heard this thing on Joe Rogan” and “Joe said … ” Perhaps I am being red-pilled? After listening to nothing but Rogan, his cadence is starting to creep into my speech: “That fucking sucks … ,” I find myself saying in a kind of Rogany drawl. Argh. Stop! But the things I am hearing are making me think about things (donating blood, Occupy Wall Street, psilocybin in communion wafers, Twitter as an instrument of world peace). It has not been a total waste of time. Part of the seduction with Rogan is that he doesn’t appear to be controlled by outside interests. He’s natural. If you are used to watching say three hours of breakfast television a day, you know that Karl Stefanovic is not going to just say what he thinks or offer guests a joint or go super niche on things like defunding the police. And so when someone in the media does appear to break out of some corporate mould, it’s compelling. Joe would like this. I’m going to go to the gym for three hours and listen to a full Joe Rogan podcast while I WORK OUT. Then I’m going to buy some supplements. I cue up Whitney Simmons – the first female guest I’ve heard (male guests vastly outnumber the women by something like nine to one). It’s hard to listen to Rogan while on the elliptical. For a start I need to hold my phone as headphones don’t really reach, and secondly it’s not good workout listening. But I like their chemistry: just two people hanging out, shooting the shit. At the gym my headphones break, which means on my walk, where I was going to try and get in an hour of Rogan time, I have to circle Rushcutters Bay with Rogan on speaker. Listen to Rogan interview Macaulay Culkin while folding laundry. Listen to Rogan interview Matt Taibbi while cooking rice. Can’t bring myself to listen to Jordan Peterson, which I’ve queued up next. Wake up and am determined to tackle the second hour of the Dave Smith interview. Will it ever end? I’ve been listening to it for days. Oh, I see. This is no good. I was kind of with them until Joe started saying that young people don’t need the vaccine. That only the old and vulnerable like his parents should take it. Gross. Get some nurse that’s been working on the ICU for two years as a guest on your show rather than a fuckknuckle libertarian. I’m disappointed. It’s not just misinformation – but it’s misinformation from Joe. His tone implies that young people who take the vaccine are pussies. And by this stage, after listening to him for hours and hours and hours, I like him (and I am starting to speak like him). I think he’s cool and funny. And if he says people who take vaccines are pussies then that has an effect. Part of the unique danger and disappointment of Rogan spreading misinformation is that he is so trusted by so many listeners. The guy is super sticky. Listeners are with him for three hours at a stretch. They get to really know him and value his opinions. This is a type of power in the media we’ve not seen for a very long time. And of course, with great power comes great responsibility. The effect is to finally turn him off.",Opinion/Opinion,"If the only voice I hear for a week is Joe Rogan’s, what sort of person will I become? | Brigid Delaney",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/11/if-the-only-voice-i-hear-for-a-week-is-joe-rogans-what-sort-of-person-will-i-become
2/11/2022,"You wouldn’t normally expect an Australian government agency to slap down a user on Twitter for spreading a “baseless myth” or to explain to another person that “there’s this whole universal franchise concept in Australia that we’ve had for quite some time now” in response to a question about voters’ intelligence. But the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is in the business of democracy. Its main job is to run federal elections but it also plays an educational role – and that’s where the commission’s increasingly popular Twitter account comes in.  You won’t see the tax office jump in to squish misinformation with an abrupt: “This is not the first time you’ve made a claim like this. Disappointing to read.” Or the Productivity Commission playfully replying to a grateful reader in dummy text because their Twitter handle was Lorem ipsum – placeholder text in the design world. Cheers, lorum ipsum. And can we just take a moment to say dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. When the AEC first joined social media in 2012 it started out just like any other government-affiliated account, fairly inactive with only “robotic responses” to other users, the commission’s digital engagement director, Evan Ekin-Smyth, says. But more recently it has started creating a real stir and developed devoted fans. It’s clear but chatty, direct but upbeat. Ekin-Smyth describes it as “personable” with a “firm but friendly” approach. “We progressively became a little bit more active and forthright. But it’s certainly jumped up a notch in this electoral cycle,” Ekin-Smyth says. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The account steps in to break up Twitter fights over voting laws or to set the record straight on the process of electing a new parliament. As we get closer to the 2022 poll – expected in May – there are a lot of questions to answer. Why do we vote with pencils not pens? Is it OK for a minister to say the Morrison government instead of the Australian government? Can unvaccinated Australians vote? And what’s the deal with the colour purple? A few people have noticed we're quite active online. We're here to answer your questions and provide facts about the process we run. Not sure about something? We can help. pic.twitter.com/Zgaf7QhpVB The account is quick to offer answers. Pens smudge and don’t work in the tropics. Yes Morrison government is A-OK. Unvaccinated Australians can of course vote and please, if you are a political candidate, don’t use signage that is close to the AEC’s distinctive purple. But the casual tone of the official AEC Twitter account belies a growing concern – that Australia is experiencing the same distrust of the political process as seen during the last US election. “What’s happened in international democracies, particularly the US, of course, is that people have started to question the electoral process a little bit more than they otherwise have done in the past,” Ekin-Smyth says. In late 2020, Donald Trump made false claims that the Democrats had rigged the election. The claims helped fuel the 6 January 2021 insurrection and left a lasting impact on trust in America’s democracy. “Our approach is in response to that,” Ekin-Smyth says. “When somebody is talking about the electoral process, we want them to have the facts.” The AEC has a team of six people – including Ekin-Smyth – who send the tweets. They all have specialist knowledge in commission protocols and election matters so the posts aren’t vetted. There is plenty of misinformation for the AEC to combat. One bizarre myth – recently peddled by anti-establishment protesters in Canberra – is that the AEC will use Dominion voting machines which came to prominence after the US election. Speaking this week, protest spokesperson Riccardo Bosi said the electoral commission had asked the government to use Dominion vote-counting machines. “Do you think you’ll get a free and fair election under these bastards?” Bosi said. A video was posted to Twitter and the AEC’s reaction was swift. “This is completely false and very disappointing. The AEC has never recommended using voting machines and has no relationship with Dominion,” the account tweeted. “The speaker is citing a 5-year-old parliamentary report that mentions the AEC and Dominion in adjacent paragraphs.” This is completely false and very disappointing. The AEC has never recommended using voting machines and has no relationship with Dominion.The speaker is citing a 5 year-old Parliamentary report that mentions the AEC and Dominion in adjacent paragraphs. pic.twitter.com/w6K3FyJ5Ct The discourse underneath was a lot more sensible – with one user pointing out the ACT uses voting machines but at a federal level it made less sense. “And really the only reason to do it (get voting machines) is getting a reasonably final result in terms of ‘who the new government is’ on the night from a Hare Clark system … Federally you don’t need that because nobody cares about the Senate on the night,” the user wrote. The AEC response was swift – and fun. “Are you just going to sit there and take that, @AuSenate???” It's hard to think of a snappy comeback when you're still reeling from the blow Ekin-Smyth says his team has seen a growing amount of misinformation – and the number of people engaging with it. During the 2019 federal election, a member of the public posted a photo of themselves next to a ballot box, claiming to be a polling official and saying they were chucking votes out. The AEC was quick to investigate it and have the post taken down – but it’s that type of material Ekin-Smyth worries will go viral. “We could run an election where everything’s absolutely tickety-boo, done by the letter of the law, and there are no problems whatsoever. “But if people question it and the perception of the election is that’s not the case, then we’ve got a problem.

People might be more disenfranchised with politics, but trust in how the process plays out during elections is still high, Ekin-Smyth says. “The number of people who indicated after the 2019 federal election that they trusted the AEC was in the 90s [percentage points]. It was a slight increase on the previous election in 2016. “There are electoral management bodies overseas who would run a mile and climb the mountain to receive those sorts of raving reviews. But any level of distrust is a concern and we want to make sure we can protect that as much as possible.” Dear @AusElectoralCom. @ScottMorrisonMP told us at the #NPC today he will be walking into a #ballotbox in the coming #election.

Along the way, the AEC Twitter team hopes to continue winning fans and making other departments and agencies jealous. “We do get interactions from colleagues across the public service, looking on with a bit of wonder at how we have such freedom,” Ekin-Smyth says. “We are truly independent, I suppose, and in some ways, our social media approach is evidence of that.” Understand where you're coming from, but disagree. Frankly, a tone of 'professionalism' both bores and disengages the people we're trying to talk to. Voting is open to all Australian citizens.

2/11/2022,"Rightly considered one of cinema’s greatest paranoid thrillers, John Frankenheimer’s 1962 classic The Manchurian Candidate is a film that remains hugely engaging – and surprisingly topical. Adapted from Richard Condon’s novel of the same name, its famous title lingers in the zeitgeist, still used to speculate on puppet-mastering foreign powers and their political influence. The film opens with the Medal of Honor being awarded to Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) for his service in the Korean war. Shaw returns home to a rousing reception, but isn’t a real hero: the Sergeant and the rest of his platoon were brainwashed into believing he saved their lives during combat. Installed as a sleeper agent, a hypnotised Shaw can do the dirty work of communists, activated by the sight of a playing card: the queen of diamonds.  Controlling Shaw is part of an intricate scheme orchestrated by villains including Eleanor Iselin (Angela Lansbury, delivering a classic performance), who is secretly working to turn the US government into an authoritarian regime while masterminding her senator husband’s vice-presidential bid. Not everyone submits so easily, though: the film’s protagonist, Major Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra), senses something is up, suffering from an intense recurring dream – “a real swinger of a nightmare”. The visualisation of this nightmare forms the film’s unforgettable sequence: a surreal space where the American soldiers appear to be at a meeting of a New Jersey ladies’ garden club. They’re actually sitting, totally brainwashed, in front of a congregation of communist scientists. Frankenheimer blends these mixed realities together in hallucinogenic ways, such as showing a well-dressed woman addressing the club, then a spooky smooth-scalped scientist in her place. All this might sound like a preposterous example of McCarthyism on steroids, but it’s executed so well you barely even notice the silliness of it. Sinatra’s frazzled performance is key to film’s success, skilfully illustrating the protagonist’s ravaged mindset and imbuing the drama with red-hot intensity. “There’s something phony about me, about Raymond Shaw, about the whole Medal of Honor business,” Marco says, embroiled in a mystery without knowing what the mystery even is, let alone how to solve it. The film has an uncomfortably edgy aesthetic, infusing what might have been a handsome monochrome look with off-kilter effects – including odd camera angles and blurry elements. Frankenheimer received praise in particular for an out-of-focus shot of Sinatra, with critics suggesting he was using a distorted camera lens to illustrate a disoriented mindset – only for the director to later explain this was unintentional and he was working with the best he had. If the premise were played out today, Shaw wouldn’t be activated by a playing card – instead, maybe, an app on his phone or an implant in his brain (as was the case in a decent, workmanlike remake released in 2004, with Denzel Washington in Sinatra’s role). But that’s one of the least interesting examples of how the contemporary world differs from the one imagined in the film. If the Kremlin wanted to interfere with an American election these days, they could simply spread online misinformation to do the dirty work for them. The villains in Frankenheimer’s film go to drastic lengths, planning to exploit a political assassination (executed by the brainwashed Shaw) and, in the subsequent chaos, usher in an authoritarian regime – by “rallying a nation of viewers to hysteria”, as they put it. This seems almost quaint today: you don’t need extraordinary circumstances to rally Americans into hysteria; just a microphone and media coverage. While the term “The Manchurian Candidate” might not resonate all that much with younger generations, the film – despite being rooted in a very particular political context – has a degree of metaphoric malleability. Most importantly, perhaps, it’s very finely crafted, with only a few flat scenes en route to an unforgettable finale.",Arts/Culture,The Manchurian Candidate: one of cinema’s greatest paranoid thrillers still resonates,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/11/the-manchurian-candidate-one-of-cinemas-greatest-paranoid-thrillers-still-resonates
2/11/2022,"The Australian government has officially listed the koala as endangered after a decline in its numbers due to land clearing and catastrophic bushfires shrinking its habitat. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, accepted the recommendation of the threatened species scientific committee that the koala populations of Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory should have their conservation status upgraded.  The stronger listing under national law is recognition that the koala’s plight has become more urgent and that successive Australian governments have failed to turn the much-loved animal’s circumstances around since it was listed as vulnerable in 2012. It comes after the Morrison government last month announced $50m to help the species. The funding was welcomed by environment groups but described as a “drop in the ocean” if the root causes of the species’ decline were not addressed. Ley said in addition to the endangered listing, the government planned to adopt a long-awaited national recovery plan for the koala. “Today I am increasing the protection for koalas in NSW, the ACT and Queensland, listing them as endangered rather than their previous designation of vulnerable,” Ley said. “The impact of prolonged drought, followed by the black summer bushfires, and the cumulative impacts of disease, urbanisation and habitat loss over the past twenty years have led to the advice.” Environment groups have long argued the koala’s conservation status should be upgraded. Three organisations – Humane Society International (HSI), WWF-Australia and the International Fund for Animal Welfare – nominated it for the endangered listing. “The koala has gone from no listing to now being declared endangered on the Australian east coast within a decade,” said Dermot O’Gorman, WWF-Australia’s chief executive. “That is a shockingly fast decline for one of the world’s most iconic animals. The endangered status is a grim but important decision by minister Ley. “There is still time to save this globally iconic species if the uplisting serves as a turning point in koala conservation. We need stronger laws and landholder incentives to protect their forest homes.” The endangered listing will provide additional protection for koalas because it lowers the threshold at which a development must be assessed under national laws for potentially significant impacts on the species. The recovery plan sets out the key threats to the koala and actions needed to prevent its extinction. Such a plan had been identified under national environmental laws as a requirement for the species for the past nine years but no Australian government had developed one, making it one of almost 200 recovery plans for Australia’s threatened species and habitats that were overdue. It took the black summer bushfire disaster to prompt consultation on a draft, with a final version delivered to the minister late last year. Once a recovery plan is adopted, ministers are legally bound not to make decisions that are inconsistent with it, however governments have no obligation to actually implement the plan. The koala is under pressure from multiple ongoing threats including disease, global heating and clearing of its habitat for development. In 2020, a NSW parliamentary inquiry found the species would be extinct in that state by 2050 unless governments took urgent action to protect its habitat and turn the declines around. Alexia Wellbelove, a senior campaign manager at HSI, said Ley’s decision should prompt Australian governments to do more to address the declining state of the country’s environment. “Although it’s devastating for the koala it’s an important action for their protection,” she said. “It’s a cue for governments really to take a stand against continued habitat clearing for koalas. We can’t just continue business as usual.” Wellbelove said the decision needed to be followed by action on the review of national environmental laws by the former competition watchdog head, Graeme Samuel. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Samuel found Australian governments had comprehensively failed in their duty to protect the environment and the country’s iconic wildlife had suffered because of it. He made 38 recommendations to transform the act, including a proposal for new national environmental standards that require clear outcomes for Australia’s plants and animals. “Until such time that we have strong national environmental standards that specify no-go areas around critical habitat for species such as the koala, habitat destruction will continue and this must be addressed urgently,” Wellbelove said.",News/Environment,Koala listed as endangered after Australian governments fail to halt its decline,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/11/koala-listed-as-endangered-after-australian-governments-fail-to-halt-its-decline
2/11/2022,"Ralph Cordingley had three great loves – his family, golf and music. In his final months he asked for his favourite sheet music to be brought to his nursing home because he couldn’t bear the songs they were singing. Aged 85 when he died, his daughter, Deborah Clarke, is sure if it weren’t for acquiring Covid-19, he’d still be alive today.  “There was no reason to believe he wouldn’t have lived longer … he was fully cognitive and smart,” Deborah says. At the same time, though, it’s not about that, not really. “It’s about celebrating them, not just being a statistic,” Deborah says. “These people had lives.” Up until his 80s, Ralph was still playing golf with a tidy handicap of nine. Then a near-death fall meant he decided to enter aged care. He’d been residing at a Blue Care aged facility in Caloundra, Queensland for 18 months before he caught Covid. He was so fit and healthy before then, Deborah says he’d been considering leaving the home because he didn’t like the food. She used to speak with Ralph on the phone every day. Now a grandmother herself, the wild days of her youth are far behind her. She still has purple hair, though, in homage to her enigmatic father. “My dad was a bit of a character,” she says. “He read encyclopaedias from cover to cover; he was very smart – larger than life. “When he was on his way to the hospital [after acquiring Covid], I spoke to him on the way and he said ‘I might get better food.’ That was how he was.” Deborah only found out her father was Covid-positive when he rang her himself. She received no correspondence from the aged care facility until the morning he was transferred to hospital. “It was a shock to me, I thought: ‘How did that happen?’” she says of his diagnosis. “Then I didn’t know how sick he was. He said he was dizzy when I spoke to him in the ambulance on the way there … they thought they could medicate him, but I knew it was serious because the nurse was really emotional. “I thought they’d put him on oxygen and he’d pull through but he was too far advanced by the time he got there.” Born on 20 November 1936, Ralph spent much of his life in the Sunshine Coast town of Caloundra, where he was a longtime president of the Lions Club and a popular councillor – instrumental in helping to buy the local hall. “He was always helpful, understanding, a big personality,” Deborah says. “They all loved him … he put others before himself, and he had a good sense of humour. Even at the nursing home he thought they weren’t running their meetings properly.” Ralph loved his great-granddaughter Kirra, and accompanied her to her school formal last September. Kirra is a top swimmer at her high school and Deborah says her father was the 18-year-old’s “number one supporter”, financially and emotionally. In the end, though, she thinks her dad made the choice to go. “He didn’t want it to be prolonged, he’d just had enough,” she says. “He told me – ‘I want to be kaput’, but he stayed on oxygen so he could say goodbye to my brothers and sisters, and to FaceTime my granddaughter. “When I went to see him at the end-of-life visit, they went to give him water, and he said ‘No, I want cordial.’ They told him he was being bossy and he said ‘Bugger it, I’m not drinking water any more.’” Spoken like a man who knew how to suck the marrow out of life until the end. Deborah says she still has a stack of postcards from various cruises her dad went on in his retirement. He loved them because they were an opportunity to “show off his dancing and singing skills”, two of his great pleasures. “He loved all of that – very much a gentleman. He loved dressing up in his suits and travelling the world,” she says. The last tune Ralph sang was his favourite of all time – The Impossible Dream – and he bellowed it from palliative care unit in hospital just four days before he died. Made popular by the 1965 Broadway musical Man of La Mancha, it is sung by Don Quixote, a man doomed to fail but strident in his belief the world would be bettered for his trying: To dream the impossible dream, to fight the unbeatable foe, to bear with unbearable sorrow, and to run where the brave dare not go … And I know, if I’ll only be true, to this glorious quest, that my heart will lie peaceful and calm, when I’m laid to my rest. “It’s such a poignant song,” Deborah says. “It was the last piece of sheet music he got me to bring him in November when he didn’t like the songs at the nursing home. “I remember sitting with him that month [before he tested positive] and he saw a picture and said he hated it because it reminded him of Covid. He said anyone this old has to have concerns … I think in a way he knew Covid was going to take him.” Ralph passed away in hospital on the 30 January, where his family members had to dress in full PPE to visit him. Less than 24 hours later, Deborah was told to collect his possessions from the nursing home. She says she will remember her dad as an “old-school gentleman” with a cheeky streak that he’s had since her childhood. “When they rang me to tell me he passed away, I said, ‘I’d rather remember him wanting cordial than seeing the body,’” Deborah says. “I don’t even know if I’ve processed it, it’s easy to go into destruction and denial.

He prefers plumbing the murky depths of those closest to him, sifting their grit (and his own) for kernels of meaning, upturning stones to glean what unsightly realities lie beneath. The novelist–poet–journalist–playwright is perhaps best known for his critically regarded memoirs Hoi Polloi and Muck, darkly comic renderings of a turbulent childhood in New Zealand with two flawed, idiosyncratic parents: his glamour-puss mother, whom he introduces as “Heels” (she liked shoes), and his gambling, racehorse-owning father, “Winks” (self-explanatory). “Heels” was particularly memorable: a butcher’s daughter obsessed with class, described in Muck as “a bundle of airs and prejudice, strut and flutter, lipstick and hairspray”. She seems to have returned as an older woman in The Grass Hotel, Sherborne’s latest novel, the entirety of which comprises her internal monologue (written in the oft-avoided second-person) addressed to her adult son. We learn that her “wiring” is awry: she has dementia, and her mental faculties are deteriorating. She believes herself “refined”, entitled to a more rarefied air, and is prone to belittling her son, an animal lover she describes as “born numb” and an “embarrassment”. He grows up to be a kind of broncobuster, taming unruly horses on a farm (his “grass hotel”), which he does around travelling across town to care for his equally unruly, waning mother and his ill father, Twinkle – who has “bad shadows” of the body.  Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning It takes little sleuthing to recognise these characters as Sherborne’s parents, and even a variation of the author himself. As he has written elsewhere, his mother had Alzheimer’s before her death, and his father died of cancer. The Grass Hotel reads as a stylised story about dementia’s throes, familial strictures and the cycle of a child becoming the parent – but beneath the surface lies a far more intriguing subtext of a son inhabiting his mother, parsing meaning from his parents’ final years. Hoi Polloi and Muck handled Sherborne’s childhood and adolescence, but he has yet to delve into his adulthood. Is this a novel, then, or the third memoir? Is it both? It doesn’t matter, really. Autobiography recurs in Sherborne’s creative writing, such as in his Melbourne prize-winning novel The Amateur Science of Love and Off the Record, as well as in his poetry collection Necessary Evil. His speciality is “inside jobs”, as he once wrote in an essay for the Australian, a penchant for flouting the “intimate, sacred code” of protecting family secrets and instead prying them apart for the sake of art. He quotes the poem Epic by Patrick Kavanagh: “I have lived in important places, times / When great events were decided.” To Sherborne, great events are not the grandiose epics woven in tapestry, but the ordinary realities of the people close to us. It is curious, though, how often Sherborne returns to the same source material in different mediums, revisiting moments as if something remains unsaid. In the poem Ash Saturday, Sherborne’s elegy to his father, he recounts how upon scattering his father’s ashes in the ocean, they clung to his skin in the water: “Some of him sticks to my swimming hands – / I shudder and dunk to wash him from me”. In his doctoral paper, he writes: “you left out how hard it had been to get the plug out of the plastic tube containing his ashes. You had to leave your mother sitting on the sand while you ran to her apartment for a screwdriver and hammer.” This scene re-emerges in The Grass Hotel, and it is one of its most morbidly funny and poignant. Perhaps in fiction Sherborne has found it feels most authentic. This authenticity is helped by the novel’s heavily stylised form. Its sentences are discursive, lyrical, beat-poetic. As the mother’s dementia worsens, the prose becomes less coherent, a soup of dissociated meanings evoking the difficulties of the neurological syndrome and its opaque interiority. Take this passage, where the mother wants to tell her nurse to leave: I knew the know-how for making signs. The sign for Get out was a pointed finger. I still know this but the know-how goes in blanks and blinks. Worse. Each week worse. Blank. Blink. Think. Blank. Goes. This fragmented writing – with its echoes of the childlike half-speak of poet Ania Walwicz – is a heightening of Sherborne’s “exaggerated talking”, a monologue style found variously throughout his other books. Here it’s not always evenly paced – there are times the mother’s character feels transparent, revealing Sherborne at his desk – but mostly the novel’s poetic, image-rich, disjointed realm is immersive and memorable, with its lightning “in cardiac jags”, its spiderwebs “mid-air like skeleton flowers”, its broiling sun decanting wind as if “burning drinks of breath”. The Grass Hotel leaves us with a persuasive articulation of familial power dynamics, their emotional turbulence, and the psychical cling – like ash in water – of our parents. “We slip into our children’s minds and they don’t know if it’s actual or figment,” says the novel’s mother to her son, the author to himself. “Carried in them onward and they slip into their children the same.”  The Grass Hotel by Craig Sherborne is out now through Text Publishing",Arts/Books,The Grass Hotel by Craig Sherborne review – immersive and poetic portrait of dementia,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/11/the-grass-hotel-by-craig-sherborne-review-immersive-and-poetic-portrait-of-dementia
2/11/2022,"It was 8.10pm and I was running through the dark streets, desperately searching. Just as I was about to concede defeat, I spotted him. He was near the corner pub, lying lifeless on the nature strip. I looked upward to thank the heavens, then messaged my partner: “I’ve found Teddy.” Teddy was my child’s, well, teddy. The two were inseparable. He did all that a good “transitional object” should do – helped Holly get to sleep and soothed her when she was upset. But Teddy was much more than that; he was her confidant, cub, dance partner, hanky, sunshade, plate, mop and weapon.  A couple of years on the job had taken its toll. Once a handsome, light brown bear, he’d become matted and filthy. He looked, as my partner cruelly observed, like a rag with a head. But Holly adored him and that made him priceless. If we couldn’t find him, Holly wouldn’t sleep. If Holly didn’t sleep, neither could we. And that is why a ragged bear became the central figure of our family. Understanding the precariousness of our situation, we bought backup bears – a gaggle of understudies if we were to lose the main man. None fooled Holly. They were too fluffy, too odourless or their eyes were too close together. And although we tried to age them (rolling them in the dirt and squishing them under mattresses), she knew. Holly was our only child then, although it was like we had two. When we hired a babysitter, we emphasised that while Holly was important, so was Teddy. He should be included in any head count. When the babysitter returned from taking Holly to the park one day, she burst through the door. “Is Teddy here?” she asked frantically. We assured her that he was, and relief washed in. Unhelpfully, Teddy was a master of camouflage – especially at bedtime. His nondescript ratty colour ensured he blended perfectly into bathmats, carpets and upholstered dining chairs. It also didn’t help that Holly would habitually fling him out of the pram – maybe she was practising the adage: “If you love them, set them free.” More likely she was testing us. We found him in the library, the cafe, the gutter and even on the road. That time he was clearly a hit-and-run victim, even flatter than before with a tyre mark down his front. Somehow Teddy always found his way back to us. Until the day he didn’t. It was winter. Teddy wasn’t in the pram. Or at home. Or the park. After so many false alarms, I was confident he’d show up. We just had to look harder. We retraced our steps, looked in bushes and wrote a “Lost Bear” post in our neighbourhood Facebook group (all we got was 22 sad-face reactions). None of it worked. He was gone. Holly was inconsolable, and so were we. In desperation we pulled out the backup bears. That failed. We tried other, similar soft toys. She wouldn’t have it. A few weeks later, something odd happened. She chanced on one of the spare bears in her toy box. “It’s Teddy!” she cried. “He’s back.” He clearly wasn’t, and I studied her, trying to work out what was happening. “Er, yes … he’s back!” I said, playing along. “And he’s so fluffy! He’s been … out in the rain?!” I wouldn’t have won an Oscar for that dialogue, but I didn’t need to. I padded out the story, adding in bits about where he’d been, how he didn’t have a hairdryer to tame his wild fur. With Teddy’s “return”, I thought we would slip back into the swing of things, but it was never quite the same. Our enthusiasm for the new guy felt a little forced. Holly knew that we knew, but perhaps she was just trying to create an alternative, more comforting reality. Or maybe she was finding a way to leave Teddy on her own terms, as she gradually shifted her attention to a little mauve unicorn. Now we have a second child, and her chosen cuddly toy is an owl. We’ve learned our lesson and bought five birds. We diligently rotate them so that each one is worn down equally, infused with the scent of home. We’ve lost three already.

2/11/2022,"Last week, near the marble-clad walls of Australia’s largest library, a perplexing confrontation broke out between anti-vaccination protesters and the far right’s news outlet of choice, Rebel News. One of the Convoy to Canberra members stood over Avi Yemini, Rebel News’s key figure in Australia, as a small crowd and police watched on.  “I’m not going to be intimidated by you, Rebel News, or anybody else,” the protester said. “We don’t want you going up to people.” Others chimed in to defend Yemini. “He’s on our side,” one said. Some began to chant “Avi out! Avi out!” before vision of the incident – which Rebel News says was selectively edited to delete a chant of “Avi stay!” – cuts out. The scene was jarring, not least because Rebel News has positioned itself as an ally of the protesters, their lone voice in an industry otherwise uniformly hated. “Avi out” pic.twitter.com/eVWSiVHg8F It speaks to Rebel News’s uncomfortable position within the convoluted ecosystem of such protests. The crowds gathered in Canberra are populated by a disparate collection of sovereign citizens, wellness advocates, anti-vaccination groups, conspiracy theorists, doomsday preppers, United Australia party supporters, and other fringe political groups. Some welcomed Yemini as a kind of cult hero. Others accused him of trying to monetise their movement. Despite the mixed reception, one thing is abundantly clear. The anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown protests, including last year’s Melbourne rallies, have been a boon for Rebel News. It has posted an avalanche of social media content about the convoy, amplifying it across an audience of hundreds of thousands across Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Telegram and Instagram. In return, audiences have grown exponentially, taking its social media following beyond some of Australia’s well-established traditional news mastheads, and increasing its ability to raise funds. On Twitter – a less-used platform for most anti-vaccination groups – Rebel News Australia dominated the Canberra convoy discourse. Analysis provided to the Guardian by the Queensland University of Technology Digital Media Research Centre shows two accounts – the international Rebel News account and Rebel News Australia – quickly became the two largest disseminators among the 32,218 tweets attached to the two main Canberra convoy hashtags. “They are by far the biggest drivers, amplifiers of it,” Dr Timothy Graham, the centre’s chief investigator, told the Guardian. “I think you can say that without a shadow of a doubt.” On Facebook, where Rebel News Australia is followed by 158,000 users, regular posts about the convoy have helped drive up interactions and grow its audience. In the week to 5 February, Rebel News Australia’s interactions spiked considerably to 95,000, almost double the week prior and triple the page’s weekly average for the past year, driving a 4% growth in its following. The trend is similar – though far more muted – to that witnessed during the September rallies in Melbourne, where Rebel News was ubiquitous. The Melbourne rally fuelled record growth for the page, delivering it almost 44,000 new followers in a single week in September, a growth of more than 64%. Without providing specific detail, Facebook has confirmed to The Guardian that it has removed some of Rebel News’s Covid content for breaching its misinformation and harm policies. But it’s done little to dampen its rise. Since creating its Facebook page in September 2020, Rebel News Australia has built a greater following on the platform than the Hobart Mercury, Newcastle Herald and the Canberra Times. On Yemini’s YouTube account, which had an established following prior to him joining Rebel News, the surge from the Melbourne protests was huge. He grew his subscriber base by 54,000 in September and 73,000 in October, according to analytics tool Social Blade, taking it to a total of 697,000. His monthly video views peaked at 17m in October, and have again surged to almost 15m in January, staggering increases from the 1.9m views he received in August. Many of Rebel News posts link back to donation pages or fundraising campaigns to fund its operations. In Rebel News’s report about GoFundMe cutting off donations to the Canadian convoy protesters, for example, Rebel News included an option for readers to donate to the outlet. “They’re in the middle and I think what’s really happening ... is they’re trying to leverage and exploit what’s going on to build the brand, to get clout, and to try and get donations,” Graham said. “And the crabs are scrambling up the pot.” Rebel’s fundraising efforts continue despite the efforts of PayPal, which reportedly cut services for Rebel News, and YouTube, which has attempted to prevent Rebel News and Yemini from monetising its platform. The way Rebel is fundraising from the protests has itself become a source of consternation among some of those gathered in Canberra. In another video from the protest site, Yemini was filmed from afar by an anti-vaccination group streaming live to its followers. “He was a guy that bagged us out two years ago … really disliked us,” the narrator says. “But started going to our protests, and then started making a lot of money from our protests.” “I haven’t made a cent from our protests.” Rebel News says Yemini is on a fixed salary and has not profited from coverage of any individual topic. In September, as anti-vaccination protests in his country grew, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau fielded a question from a representative of Rebel News. Rebel News’s inclusion at a leaders’ debate had been a point of contention. The organisation was initially blocked from attending, but sued the government to force its way in. When Rebel News questioned the prime minister about the episode, Trudeau did not hold back. “The reality is, organisations – organisations like yours – that continue to spread misinformation and disinformation on the science around vaccines … is part of why we’re seeing such unfortunate anger and lack of understanding of basic science,” said Trudeau. “Frankly, your – I won’t call it a media organisation – your group of individuals need to take accountability for some of the polarisation that we’re seeing in this country.” Rebel News’s resources and influence is derived from its Canadian base. It was founded there in 2015, is led by controversial Canadian figure Ezra Levant, and traffic to its website remains overwhelmingly North American. As it rose to prominence, Rebel News openly embraced figures from the far right. Contributors included Tommy Robinson, the founder of the English Defence League, Katie Hopkins, and “Proud Boys” founder Gavin McInnes. During the 2017 Charlottesville rallies, a then Rebel correspondent Faith Goldy spoke positively about white nationalists’ views on race and on the “JQ”, slang for the “Jewish question”. Goldy, who has denied being a white supremacist, was fired after appearing on a neo-Nazi Daily Stormer podcast, and Levant has insisted she was not reporting for Rebel News at Charlottesville and attended “in direct contradiction of my written instruction to her not to attend”. “The moment she confessed that she had secretly appeared on an anti-Semitic podcast, I fired her,” he told the Guardian. After surviving blow-back for the 2017 events, which prompted boycotts by advertisers and Canada’s Conservative party, the pandemic provided an opportunity for Rebel News to shift its focus to anti-vaccination and anti-lockdown causes. The Canada convoys, which inspired the Australian iteration, have shown the outlet’s ability to harness the hate for traditional media among anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown protesters. Late last month, Levant was greeted by a rapturous crowd when he addressed convoy protesters outside parliament in Ottawa. “I want to tell you what excites me the most about this crowd,” he said. “I see a lot of cameras. A lot of independent journalists. Because when people say ‘what do we do about the media?’, I say, ‘you become the media’.” The number of Canadians accessing Rebel News main website has increased by 70% in the past month alone, according to Similarweb, a traffic analysis tool. Australians now make up 13% of the traffic to the website, the third most of any country. The Australian audience to the website has grown by 11% in a single month. Elise Thomas, an open source intelligence analyst with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, says anti-vaccination and anti-lockdown communities are well-suited for groups like Rebel News to “reinvigorate their following”. “The thing about these kind of fringe communities is that they are often really hyper-engaged communities, they’re not getting this content anywhere else in their life,” Thomas says. Graham describes the protests as “sure-thing in terms of engagement” for groups like Rebel News. “It’s not content that actually has any coherent ideological driver,” he says. “A lot of people are talking about it and it kind of speaks to a really strongly-held identity and partisan beliefs, it really affirms people’s belief about themselves.” Levant contested the notion that Rebel News was profiteering from the protest coverage. “You suggest that we are profiteering off of our protest coverage. But in fact, advertising represents only about 1% of our revenues, as we have been demonetized by YouTube and Facebook censors,” he said. “Whether we have one view or one million, our YouTube advertising revenue is the same — zero.” The hiring of Yemini, who had already amassed a sizeable YouTube following of his own, has helped propel Rebel News to new audiences here. As has Yemini’s recent appearances on Fox News in the US, where he is framed as an objective commentator on Australia’s Covid response. Levant is clearly a fan. He told the Guardian he was “the best” in the company. “I’m not sure what your basis is to suggest that our Australian expansion is due to Covid. I think it’s pretty obvious that it’s driven by the talent of Avi,” he said. He said Rebel News does not consider its audience “far right”. “Traditional partisan labels have lost much of their meaning in the past two years,” he said. Australian content – short, slickly-produced videos, often heavy on confrontation – mirrors the Canadian style, and the two arms also adopt similar strategies to muscle in on the space of news outlets. When Yemini was rejected for a press pass for the Victorian parliament, for example, he sued the state government, much like Rebel’s Canadian arm last year. Yemini, who served in the Israeli military, came to Rebel News with his own chequered past. He has been convicted of assaulting his ex-wife and once described himself as the “the world’s proudest Jewish Nazi” – a comment he has since claimed was sarcasm. The rise of Rebel News Australia on the back of anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown sentiment raises questions for the major social media companies, which have committed to limiting misinformation during the pandemic. Facebook would not share the amount of strikes it had delivered to Rebel News’s page. But it confirmed it had removed some content for breaching misinformation and harm policies. “People who repeatedly breach our misinformation policies will have restrictions placed on their page, if removals reach a certain threshold we will remove the page,” a Meta spokesperson says. YouTube says it has taken action directly against Yemini’s channel and the main Rebel News account by preventing them from running ads or using other monetisation features like Super Chat. “We have suspended both channels from the YouTube Partner Program. All channels on YouTube need to comply with our community guidelines and in order to monetise, channels must comply with the YouTube Partner Program policies, which includes our advertiser-friendly guidelines,” a spokesperson says. “We periodically review and remove channels that are not in compliance with our policies, and channels that repeatedly violate these policies are suspended from our partner program.”",News/Australia news,‘Avi out’: the uncomfortable relationship between Rebel News and Australia’s anti-vaccine protesters,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/11/avi-out-the-uncomfortable-relationship-between-rebel-news-and-australias-anti-vaccine-protesters
2/11/2022,"Plans to build a new $3.3m “discovery centre” on Penguin Island in Western Australia will push the threatened bird colony to breaking point, conservationists say. The state’s new environment minister, Reece Whitby, unveiled a concept design on Tuesday, which would see the existing centre on the island demolished and a new one built 50 metres away.  Construction would take place over two months in summer 2023. The design for the new centre would include a raised deck to allow penguins to nest below and may include a sprinkler system to help the birds cool down during heatwaves. “The new centre will enable the island and the City of Rockingham to better care for the little penguin residents while safely welcoming human visitors,” Whitby said. “The penguins are facing a number of critical and linked challenges – climate change, marine heatwaves and a scarcity of food – and I want to make sure we are doing everything possible to support the local population.”But conservationists said the plans are a distraction and the best solution would be to “leave the island alone”. The little penguin population on Penguin Island is suffering from declining population numbers and a horror breeding season, where half the chicks born in 2021 died, equating to roughly 10% of its overall population. The island’s colony is the second northernmost population to be found in Australia and is thought to be genetically distinct – though scientific testing to confirm this has not yet been carried out. While the penguins are on the frontline of climate change, human activity has also hampered their ability to cope, with reports of birds being struck by marine craft and being disturbed by humans on the island. The proposal has drawn the ire of scientists and the island’s tourism operator, who said it was made without consultation and pre-empts an upcoming stakeholder meeting to work out a plan to halt the penguin decline. Dr Joe Fontaine from Murdoch University said the proposals for a raised structure and a sprinkler system were “red herrings” as nesting habitat was not an issue for the colony. “What we’re seeing here again and again is using climate change as an excuse,” Fontaine said. “They’re not acknowledging there are other human impacts going on. The best solution would be to just leave the island alone.” High foot traffic in penguin breeding grounds can cause considerable stress for the birds. Though some birds will stray, when it comes to nesting they generally prefer sites away from human activity and, once established, remain faithful to that specific nest. In summer heatwaves when adult penguins are moulting their feathers, they will try to cool down in shallow water as they are unable to swim during the two-week moulting process. But when large numbers of visitors are present on the island, particularly on the beach, the penguins will avoid these areas which sometimes leads to deaths from heat exhaustion as they cannot reach the water. Fontaine said that the sound, vibration and other disturbances would only push the colony closer to “breaking point”. “This isn’t Sim City,” Fontaine said. “We’re somehow playing in this magic world where you can wave the wand, pick up the old centre and plop it into the new area and do it all in two months. “The idea that it’s possible to do the [demolition] and construction in two months is a heroic assumption.” The chief executive of Perth Wildlife Encounters, Chad D’Souza, said his organisation – which operates the existing centre on Penguin Island – supported a 2016 proposal to build a “rehabilitation centre” on the mainland at Mersey Point. As Penguin Island is closed to tourists for two months each year, a mainland centre could allow the conservation program to operate year round while controlling the movements of tourists and allowing critical rehabilitation to be undertaken for sick or injured penguins. D’Souza said he had been told the proposal was rejected by the WA Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions in favour of building on Penguin Island itself as the agency owned the land. “We just don’t believe what they’ve established is going to save the penguins,” D’Souza said. “It’s in the wrong place, it should be built as a rehabilitation centre on the mainland.” The City of Rockingham mayor, Deb Hamblin, said in a statement the council had previously “advocated” for the proposal on the mainland and was in the process of reviewing the current design. “The city holds serious concerns for the future of the little penguin population on Penguin Island,” Hamblin said. “Last year, council officially endorsed the position that conservation of the little penguin colony requires additional resources from the state, including a specific management plan and the formation of a dedicated working group to govern the matter.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A department spokesperson said in a statement that there was a “long history” of penguins nesting beneath built structures and rejected the suggestion the announcement had been made without consultation. “The design and location of the new centre is being undertaken in a manner that is sensitive to the resident penguin population and with guidance from researchers and technical experts,” they said.",News/Environment,"Little penguins on WA island will be pushed to ‘breaking point’ by construction of new centre, expert says",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/11/little-penguins-on-wa-island-will-be-pushed-to-breaking-point-by-construction-of-new-centre-expert-says
2/11/2022,"When AGL, Australia’s biggest electricity generator, announced plans on Thursday to accelerate the timetable to close its two largest coal-fired power plants, environmental groups complained the pace wasn’t fast enough. Out would go Bayswater, AGL’s 2640-megawatt black coal-fired power plant in New South Wales’s Hunter Valley, between 2030 and 2033, rather than 2035 as previously flagged. And by 2045, the 2210MW Loy Yang A brown coal-fired station in Victoria would follow, compared with a 2048 schedule, the company said.  That at least was AGL’s objective, Graeme Hunt, the company’s chief executive told investors, adding with a flourish: “the path to net zero [emissions] will be the defining challenge of our era. Companies that don’t adapt, that don’t innovate, and don’t set themselves on this path will be left behind”. Greenpeace Australia dismissed the new dates as a “token effort”, noting the two plants at current pollution rates add about 35m tonnes of CO2 yearly, or about 7% of the nation’s total. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said the updated plan was “next to meaningless for these crumbling assets” given Bayswater will be 48 years old by 2033 and in 2045, Loy Yang A will be 61 years old”. The latter point was perhaps the most germaine. The Australian Energy Market Operator is already preparing scenarios for all brown coal plants and two-thirds of black coal ones to disappear from the grid by 2032. That’s about a decade earlier than AGL is now forecasting for Loy Yang A. “[Thursday] will not be the last time the closure of a fossil fuel generator is brought forward,” said Kane Thornton, chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, which counts AGL among its almost 1,000 members. “If you look at the rate at which renewables are coming into the market, if you look at the rate at which big batteries are being deployed and the commitments that are being made in the projects being committed to, the pace of change is just accelerating.” Thornton said. Data released a fortnight ago by Aemo underscored the woes facing AGL – which by 30 June plans to split into a generator arm Accel Energy and a retailing one, AGL Australia – and other big fossil-dominated generators like EnergyAustralia and Origin Energy. Gas and coal prices are being pushed higher by global supply constraints and rising demand, while costs of wind and solar farms are falling and their energy source is basically free. Plant profitability isn’t helped, either, by 3m households with solar panels generating their own power, particularly during the middle of the day. As Aemo noted, Victoria’s spot prices in the December quarter were on average negative between 09.25 and 14.20. Between 08.00 and 16.30, they averaged just 10 cents per MW-hour. EnergyAustralia last year brought forward the planned closure of its Mt Piper coal-fired power plant near Lithgow in NSW by at least three years, while its Yallourn plant in Victoria will now shut in 2028 rather than 2032. Origin Energy, meanwhile, says the first of the units at its Eraring plant will shut in NSW by 2030. Dylan McConnell, an energy expert at the University of Melbourne said Aemo’s draft integrated system plan has various scenarios based on emissions goals. The most ambitious, assuming a trajectory that is in line with keeping global warming to 1.5C, has the first of AGL’s Loy Yang A’s units closing by 2027 and all of it by 2029, he says. “It’s a bit of a mismatch,” McConnell says. “You have this sort of market approach and then you have this planning approach, and they just don’t line up.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning One reason is Aemo’s modelling assumes a carbon budget. “In the real world, there isn’t a carbon price or any financial penalty for that,” he says. Not yet, at least. Another challenge is that while renewables have been booming, the pace of growth, particularly for new windfarms, has slowed sharply, in part because of planning uncertainties, McConnell says. Head of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, Bruce Mountain, agrees there’s every likelihood loss-making coal-fired power plants will drop out of the market faster than companies are saying publicly. AGL’s Bayswater, for instance, will lose its low-cost coal supplies from about 2024, which will then undermine its role as one of the more profitable plants. A 2030 closure date, if that’s what happens, will be challenging for NSW, Mountain says. “The NSW government needs to get another, call it 4000-5000MW of wind and solar capacity operational and producing by [2030], and a very good deal likely of storage capacity,” he says. NSW seems committed to implement its electricity infrastructure roadmap “but there isn’t time to lose”, Mountain says. Victoria is also stepping up its support for new generation capacity while Queensland “remains the real laggard”. Aemo, meanwhile, is also forecasting demand to almost double by 2050 to 330 terawatt-hours a year, from 180 TWh now, particularly as cars switch from petrol and diesel to electricity. To meet that demand and cope with plant closures, the current pipeline of proposed generation and storage capacity in the NEM stands at 138 gigawatts (GW), or more than double today’s capacity of 59GW. Renewables account for 86% of proposed projects, Aemo says. The challenges facing the power sector will only grow, though, if hopes for a hydrogen export sector are realised, McConnell said “The growth in electricity for that is really quite phenomenal,” he says. “So there’s a bit of a disconnect between what the market is doing or saying versus what the expectations are.”",News/Australia news,Why the shutdown of AGL’s coal-fired plants will probably happen even sooner than power giant says ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/11/why-the-shutdown-of-agls-coal-fired-plants-will-probably-happen-even-sooner-than-power-giant-says
2/11/2022,"Lynette McKell’s mother cries down the phone when she tells her she can no longer afford the rapid tests she needs to visit her in aged care. The near-daily visits have been a great joy for her and her mother, relieving the isolation that has been so prevalent in aged care throughout the pandemic.  But McKell’s family is struggling on a single, limited income, and the exorbitant cost of large volumes of rapid tests is proving too much. She is now forced to space out the visits to stop the spiralling costs from chewing through the limited disposable income she has each week. “We fall through the cracks. We’re not entitled to a healthcare card, so what are we supposed to do?” she said. “She cries on the phone on a regular basis … I say, ‘mum, I’m trying to take a few days between visits so I can make [the rapid tests] go a bit further.’” McKell’s story illuminates one side-effect of the government’s failure to secure adequate and reliable rapid antigen test supplies for the aged care sector. Prior to Christmas, the commonwealth promised it would provide enough stock to allow providers to give them to essential visitors for free. But the shortages mean aged care providers like St Basil’s Homes in South Australia, which cares for McKell’s mother, have been forced to prioritise their rapid test stocks for residents and workers, rather than visitors, who are being told to either find their own or purchase them from the provider at cost price. While supplies have improved in the past week, the sector is still in the dark about when shipments will arrive and at what volume. “We have still not received clarity from the [health department] regarding the ongoing supply of RATs post being in an outbreak position,” St Basil’s chief executive, Michelle Church, said. “The advice received today suggests that the supply has now stabilised and that the intent to supply free RATs to aged care providers … has not changed. “But we are still in the dark about when this will occur.” The aged care sector has been calling on the government to set up a national coordination centre to ensure consistent supplies of PPE and rapid tests, along with surge workforce planning. In a statement this week, the Australian Aged Care Collaboration group said it was continuing to press the government for “reliable supplies and more efficient distribution of RATs and PPE”. A spokesperson for the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, said the government has made more than 2.5m rapid tests available to aged care facilities last week alone for use by residents, staff, and visitors, bringing total supply of the devices to 10.7m. National cabinet was due to discuss visitation when it met on Thursday, focusing on developing nationally consistent guidelines to ensure proper visitation rights. Councils on the Ageing chief executive, Ian Yates, said some jurisdictions were providing visitation guidance that was causing “inhumane” periods of isolation for aged care residents. “We’re not just dealing with reluctance in providers [to visitation], we’re dealing with inconsistent and wrong advice from state health units,” he told Guardian Australia. “When there’s an outbreak, a resident or a couple of staff in a home, there has been persistent advice from some health units, which is not consistent, that you must lock up, and you must lock residents in their rooms. “There have been residents locked up in rooms for weeks and weeks. That is inhumane and also not necessary.” Colbeck’s office said reports of senior Australians being denied visitors and locked in their rooms were “unacceptable”. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) has been developing nationally consistent guidelines to ensure residents can receive essential visitors at all times, including during an outbreak.

2/11/2022,"The risk of widespread coral bleaching across the Great Barrier Reef has subsided after cloud and rain over the past 10 days caused “substantial cooling” of heat-stressed corals, according to the government’s reef management authority. Scientists and conservationists have feared it could suffer its sixth major mass bleaching outbreak this summer with record high temperatures over the reef in December.  But now there is cautious optimism the world heritage-listed reef – the ocean’s biggest at 2,300km long – could escape a major event with the potential to kill and weaken corals. A statement to Guardian Australia from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) said monsoonal weather in north Queensland over the past 10 days “caused substantial cooling, and the temperatures on much of the reef are now below the average for February”. “While the forecast for the rest of the month remains for above average temperatures, it is expected this will only be about half a degree warmer,” the statement said. “The current thermal anomaly and the forecasts have resulted in a diminished risk of mass bleaching on the reef this summer.” But the authority warned the reef had “already accumulated substantial heat stress over the summer” and weather over the next few weeks would be “critical in determining the final outcome”. Coral bleaching happens when the algae that gives the coral its colour and most of its food is expelled, leaving just the white skeleton visible. Depending on the severity, corals can recover or die. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Forecasts of heat stress over the reef from the US government agency the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show almost no areas currently forecast to hit levels where bleaching was likely. This contrasts with forecasts in late December that suggested by mid-February large areas of the reef north of Cairns would be at risk of bleaching severe enough to kill corals. Townsville-based Dr William Skirving, of Noaa’s Coral Reef Watch, said a monsoonal trough had brought with it cloud and rain over large areas of the reef. “It’s looking much better than it was a couple of weeks ago,” he said. NOAA’s updated coral bleaching forecast for mid-March, issued today.What a relief! https://t.co/0mTKbg4pYr pic.twitter.com/tV152DUK4h Both Noaa and Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology have said temperatures over the reef in December were the highest on record. Associate Prof Tracy Ainsworth, a coral scientist at the University of New South Wales, said the change in outlook was “welcome news for this year on the reef”. But she said in most years “we are seeing heat stress events occurring on irreplaceable coral reef ecosystems around the world”.

But there has still been heat stress accumulating and every year now we are asking how bad things will be. That’s a crazy position to be in. “These events are increasing in intensity as well as becoming more frequent.” The reef has seen five mass bleaching events – in 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020 – driven by increasing heat in the oceans caused by rising greenhouse gas levels. Some coral species cope better with heat stress than others and scientists say successive bleaching events have reduced the numbers of less heat-tolerant corals. Some scientists studying the reef say because of this shift, more heat is needed to cause the same amount of bleaching as was seen in earlier outbreaks. Last week GBRMPA said it had received several reports of minor bleaching from across the reef with areas of minor to moderate bleaching between Townsville and Port Douglas. The amount of coral over the reef has been going up in the last two years, but the Australian Institute of Marine Science has said that increase is underpinned by fast-growing corals more susceptible to bleaching. Ainsworth said this was raising the likelihood of widespread coral bleaching in the coming years when the next major event unfolded. Last year the 21-country world heritage committee ignored advice from Unesco that the reef should be placed on a list of sites “in danger” because of impacts from bleaching and poor progress on cutting pollution. The committee is due to consider the reef’s plight again at a meeting scheduled for July in Russia.",News/Environment,Great Barrier Reef: cooler weather reduces threat of mass bleaching outbreak this summer,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/11/great-barrier-reef-cooler-weather-reduces-threat-of-mass-bleaching-outbreak-this-summer
2/11/2022,"From guns and vacuum flasks to cookers and colour televisions, Enfield has long been a cradle of invention. Rifles, radios, motorbikes and dishwashers were all made in this fertile corner of north-east London’s Lea Valley, which also gave birth to the world’s first cash machine – now memorialised with a golden ATM on the high street.There may be heritage plaques a-plenty, but the glory days of local industry are long gone. The sheds of production have been replaced by the big box stores of Ikea and Wickes, the stable careers in skilled manufacturing exchanged for zero-hours warehouse contracts, in what are now some of the most deprived wards in the country. A place that was once Britain’s equivalent to Silicon Valley has more recently been known as “Shanktown”, on the proposition that, because of its violent reputation, you would be more likely to get stabbed there than dream up the next world-changing invention. But, lurking in among this ragged edgeland of retail depots, redundant gasworks and puffing waste incinerators, one shed offers a glimmer of hope – and a possible prototype for a new kind of productive local economy. Next to a cash and carry warehouse and a ready-mix concrete supplier stands Bloqs, a new £4m temple for London’s growing army of makers.  “This is not a place for spoon whittling,” says Al Parra, co-founder of the social enterprise. “We don’t look down on hobbyists and the world of ‘wellbeing making’, but this is people putting bacon on the table.” Once billed as the country’s largest “makerspace”, the project has been rebranded in more grownup terms as the UK’s first “open-access factory”, complete with £1.3m worth of equipment – a smorgasbord of saws, lathes, sanders and sewing machines – along with laser cutters, 3D-printers and a massive five-axis milling machine. Take one look at the tools here and it quickly becomes clear that this is the final boss of makerspaces. On a Tuesday morning in February, the place is humming with people making kitchen cabinets, staircase treads, public benches, playground equipment, industrial kitchens and upcycled fashion accessories. Walter and Rob of design startup Make Workspace are putting the finishing touches to their prototype work pod in one bay, while Lizzie, Marilo and Llew of social enterprise Made from Scratch wrestle with their latest treehouse design in another.“To be honest,” says Lizzie, breaking off from sanding a wooden parakeet for their new adventure playground, “I thought it might have that intimidating vibe of going into a record shop, where everyone is a bit snooty. But it’s not like that. The best thing about being based here is the people – everyone is willing to share expertise and advice, and you can always borrow each other’s tools.” A small workspace begins at £36 a day, use of most machines included, with larger and longer-term lets available and no membership fee to join. Michel, who runs a bespoke joinery business employing seven people, says he can take on much bigger projects since moving to Bloqs. “There are people with skills in metalwork, milling and a professional spray booth,” he says, “so it’s expanded what I can do in one place.” The social enterprise also has its own fabrication arm, Made at Bloqs, so it can take on jobs from local authorities and developers and subcontract work out to its members. “The opportunities here are amazing,” he adds, “and my head is clearer working in this big, light space.”The former 1960s vehicle testing warehouse has been transformed by architects 5th Studio into a light-flooded factory floor. They have added a sleek new mono-pitched building next door, with eight-metre-high ceilings, providing a combined vast 32,000 square feet of space. Ordinary materials, such as corrugated aluminium and translucent polycarbonate, have been carefully deployed, with crisp detailing that elevates the complex above its neighbours. An agricultural polytunnel canopy covers a wood store, while clusters of shipping containers are being turned into individual studios, and leftover glued laminated timber panels have been used to build a materials shop. A big whirring vacuum sucks waste wood chippings into a shredder, where it is filtered and fed into a furnace to provide all the building’s heating and hot water needs. Another system channels rainwater from the roof into a series of reed beds, forming a sustainable drainage network to reduce surface water flooding. “It’s like the Lea Valley in miniature,” says architect Tom Holbrook, who has worked on projects up and down the valley for years, and who began his career as an apprentice stage carpenter before studying architecture. “My first job was doing set builds in pig farms on the North Circular,” he adds, “so I know what a brutal existence it can be, working out of a van in freezing sheds.” Such was the life of Parra and his co-founders when they first moved to a leaky building nearby in 2011. They had begun living and working together in a warehouse in Haringey, before rent rises pushed them to look further afield, landing on a battered building in Edmonton, just across from where their gleaming new premises now stands.“It was rough as badger’s,” says Parra, “piled with trash and holes in the roof.” Two of them lived in makeshift pods, the other two in caravans. “But living and working there made us realise that we could do a lot more together than we could have done separately.” They started renting out their machines to friends when they weren’t using them, and opened a small cafe. Word spread, and soon they were joined by more people who had been priced out, losing their workspaces to the march of luxury loft conversions. “We realised we were part of a systemic need for the city,” says Parra. “Everywhere we looked, live-work was being replaced by just live, as landlords realised they could make a lot more money by converting workspace into housing.” A recent report by an independent commission found that London has lost a quarter of its industrial floorspace over the past 20 years, leaving the capital with a chronic shortage of space for the services it needs to function. Bloqs is exactly the kind of solution needed, but at first it was impossible for the team to grow, or even repair their building. “No one was willing to fund us because we’re so odd,” says Parra. “If you spoke to any money men, they’d say: ‘So, you’re proposing to give access to industrial machinery to members of the public? OK, we’ll call you.’” Then, in 2015, the group caught wind of a new mayoral fund for affordable workspace, and convinced Enfield council to put in a joint bid, resulting in a grant of £1.3m, which was match-funded by the council. Enfield put in some extra money for the building, which it owns and rents to Bloqs on a 12-year lease. “We’re classified as a ‘meanwhile use’,” Parra says. “But we’re going to put down tap roots.” The project has established partnerships with a couple of local colleges, and there are plans for an outreach programme aimed at helping refugees and former offenders back into work. “Our plan is to make ourselves completely invaluable,” he adds, “and so integrated into the economic and cultural life of the borough that we’re no longer regarded as temporary.” It already feels like more than a shed of machines. The former office and reception area has been transformed into Bloqs Kitchen, a cafe and grocery run by Marianna Leivaditaki, head chef at the Hackney restaurant Morito, where beer taps have just arrived. A local wildlife photographer is busy hanging prints for an exhibition in the cafe, while posters advertise a forthcoming make-your-own pasta day. Surely this thriving hub can’t be a cynical “meanwhile” strategy, to create a buzz before being swept away? The area might look like a postindustrial wasteland, but Bloqs sits in the middle of one of London’s most ambitious regeneration projects, the £6bn Meridian Water development. The 25-year plan, originally led by housebuilder Barratt, first proposed a bleak vision of perimeter apartment blocks stamped across the 85-hectare site, of a similarly blunt nature to the Olympic Village a little way down the valley. Barratt walked away in 2017, after disputes with Enfield over “unacceptable” proposed terms, so the council took the decision to take on the role of master developer. “We didn’t want all this public land to be turned into flats for overseas investors,” says Nesil Caliskan, who was elected council leader in 2018. “The aspiration is still for 10,000 homes and 6,000 jobs, but we’re going to phase it, so we can adapt as and when we need to, and create a proper local economy alongside the housing.” Pitched as “your place to make and create”, Meridian Water promises to include light industrial and creative space as well as offices, with the council planning to retain control of the ground and first-floor levels, so that the promised industrial units don’t all turn into coffee shops and yoga studios, as often happens in such schemes. In the council’s eyes, Bloqs plays a crucial role in creating future tenants for the district, spawning a new generation of businesses that will, hopefully, go on to occupy the planned workspace units. In a similar vein, a cluster of hangar-like film studios have been built nearby, in the hope of seeding a film production district – a plan that already seems to be bearing fruit, with the arrival of Netflix to the borough. “We see ourselves as a garden bed,” says Parra, “a platform for innovation and invention to flourish. We’ve had a lot of businesses that have already grown and moved on. But we’re here to stay.”",Arts/Art and design,Need a lathe or a laser cutter?
