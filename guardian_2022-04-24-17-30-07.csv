4/24/2022,"The Brumbies restored some pride in Australian rugby by claiming the first Kiwi scalp of Super Round with a hard-fought 28-17 victory over the Highlanders, after NSW and Queensland both fell short in the opening two days of action at AAMI Park. The Canberra-based Brumbies had only lost once through the 2022 domestic component of the competition while the Highlanders had only banked one win but the men from Dunedin still proved difficult to shake on Sunday afternoon. Brumbies halves pairing Noah Lolesio, in his return from five weeks out with an ankle injury, and Nick White were stand-outs, with a clever kicking game helping keep their opponents pinned in their own half. The Brumbies backrow of Pete Samu, Jahrome Brown and Rob Valetini also did plenty of heavy lifting, while coach Dan McKellar praised 30-year-old prop Scott Sio’s “best game in five years”. McKellar said his Brumbies didn’t feel any additional pressure to get a win for Australian rugby after the Waratahs and Reds capitulated on Saturday. “There was no pressure - we felt a whole lot of excitement,” McKellar said. “We want to create positive stories for the game in this country so we’re talking about good things instead of constant negativity, and I thought there was a lot of good things to talk about. The Brumbies should have been up 5-0 after a minute but fullback Tom Wright dropped the ball cold as he attempted a one-handed put-down over the line. Flanker Brown made no mistake 10 minutes later when his outstretched arm slammed down the ball for the Brumbies to take a 7-0 lead. A try by hooker Lachlan Lonergan then made it 14-0 but the Highlanders rallied with centre Thomas Umaga-Jensen scoring and the teams went into halftime at 17-7. After a Brumbies penalty, the Highlanders hit back again with a try by flanker James Lentjes closing the margin to seven. Another penalty strike by Lolesio gave the Australian team a little more breathing room and then the young Wallabies playmaker was able to run on to a pop pass from Irae Simone for a 72nd minute try to secure the win. McKellar said he hoped White, the Wallabies’ first-choice halfback, would turn his back on a reported $1 million a year contract to play in Japan. White himself didn’t give away if his plans included next year’s Rugby World Cup. “Not yet - that will take its course and hopefully it’s laid out sooner rather than later,” White said. Last year the Australians only managed two victories from 25 games in the trans-Tasman competition and yesterday’s results didn’t bode well for the home teams. In the first trans-Tasman clash of the year, the Waratahs were blown away by the Chiefs, who scored seven tries (four to Kiwi winger Jonah Lowe) in hammering NSW by 51-27 in a drama-filled clash. The Waratahs were in trouble early when star prop Angus Bell was red carded for a dumping tackle on Chiefs skipper Sam Cane. When teammate Jamie Roberts was binned soon after for a deliberate knock-on, NSW were down to 13 men. The Chiefs seized on the ill-discipline to run in 20 unanswered points. Things got even worse for the Waratahs when both hookers, Dave Porecki and Tom Horton, left the field with concussions. At 22-3 down, a cricket score looked likely until Waratah backrower Jed Holloway put skipper Jake Gordon through a hole and over the strip. Another try to the inspirational Gordon minutes later brought the margin back to three before the Waratahs fightback fizzled and the score blew out. Without stars James O’Connor and Jordan Petaia, Queensland were always going to struggle against the Hurricanes. But with rookie Lawson Creighton assuming the playmaking role, the Reds hit the board first through a penalty then quickly added a slick Hamish Stewart try after some Hunter Paisami lead-up magic in the 23rd minute. And when Fraser McReight peeled off the back of the maul to dot down in the 28th minute and take the score to 17-0, the upset of the year was on. However a second-half capitulation brought the underdog Reds back down to earth. They squandered that 17-0 lead and conceded 30 unanswered points to the Canes, eventually crashing to a 30-17 defeat. It will give Reds coach Brad Thorn terrible flashbacks to last year when his side broke through for a Super Rugby AU triumph only to then win just one of their five matches in Super Rugby Trans-Tasman.",Sport/Sport,Brumbies break through for win as Waratahs and Reds crushed by Kiwis,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/24/brumbies-break-through-for-win-as-waratahs-and-reds-crushed-by-kiwis
4/24/2022,"An MP found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy is being urged by local Tories to fulfil his promise to stand down, after it emerged that he has still not formally resigned from his Westminster seat. The family of Imran Ahmad Khan – who was expelled from the Tory party after his conviction earlier this month – have also been asked to intervene to ensure he goes through with his promise to stand down in the Wakefield seat which he won from Labour at the last election. Khan stated this month that he was planning to resign. He said his intention to appeal against his conviction had led him to “regrettably come to the conclusion that it is intolerable for constituents to go years without an MP who can amplify their voices in parliament”. MPs who want to resign have to write to the Treasury to begin the process. A date for a byelection can then be set. However, it is understood that no such letter has yet been received. Khan’s office did not respond to inquiries about when he would submit his resignation. Local Tories are sounding the alarm. Tony Homewood, a Tory councillor in Wakefield who acted as Ahmad Khan’s election agent in 2019, said he had noted Khan’s failure to trigger the resignation process with “considerable regret”. He appealed to Khan’s brothers – one of whom, Karim, is a prosecutor at the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague – to intervene. “I realise that [Karim Khan] is involved in very important work at the ICC but I implore him to intervene in this matter,” he tweeted. “I would remind everyone reading this tweet ... that the Khan family are good Wakefield people and are not responsible for the appalling behaviour of one of their number, which I can assure you they will certainly not condone. We pick our friends but we can’t pick our relatives.” The Wakefield byelection will be a serious test of whether the government retains the support in the “red wall” seats that it won from Labour at the last election. Labour had previously held the seat for 87 years. There had been rumours that former shadow chancellor Ed Balls could run for the seat, but he has since ruled himself out. Labour’s previous MP, Mary Creagh, has said she will not be standing again. Whichever candidate the party puts forward, Labour stands a chance of winning its first byelection victory since 2012. Dawn Shedding, who was taking her granddaughters for a walk on a bright morning in the city centre, said although she had voted for Khan in 2019, she had not been a fan. “I don’t think he did much for Wakefield but then nobody ever does,” she said. “We’re forgotten about here.” The cash-strapped Labour-held council did not attract her support, however. “There’s no investment really, nothing for the young kids to do like there used to be.” Though she plans to vote in the local election on 5 May, she has not made up her mind who to vote for, considering the parties “two bad choices”. Local figures said that major issues with the local transport network would be an element in the byelection. It was national politics – particularly “Partygate” – that was at the forefront of people’s minds in Wakefield last week, however. “I don’t think much of Starmer but Boris has to go,” said Iain Bryant, shopping with his daughter Jess in the city centre. “I didn’t vote Conservative in the last election, but I had some sympathies for him. Nobody wants to be a prime minister during a pandemic and up until recently I thought he did quite a good job. Now with all the talk about the parties and him getting fined, that annoyed me quite a lot to be honest. I’m glad he got fined but it’s not enough.” Jess, whose grandmother died of Covid in a care home without family around, added: “It’s easy to forget that he said that line about ‘letting the bodies pile up’. It seems like such a long time ago. But for the people who lost someone during that time, you don’t forget things like that. If I was ever going to vote Conservative, which I probably wouldn’t have anyway, I certainly wouldn’t now.”",News/Politics,"MP convicted of sexually molesting boy, 15, fails to keep his promise to resign",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/24/mp-convicted-of-sexually-molesting-boy-15-fails-to-keep-his-promise-to-resign
4/24/2022,"Fewer than one in three people who have been hospitalised with Covid-19 have fully recovered a year after they succumbed to infection. That is the shock finding of a survey into the impact of long Covid in the UK. The team of scientists and doctors at Leicester University also found that women had poorer recovery rates than men after hospitalisation, while obesity was also likely to hinder a person’s prospects of health improvements. Among the symptoms reported by patients a year after their initial infection were fatigue, muscle pain, poor sleep and breathlessness. “Given that more than 750,000 people have been hospitalised in the UK with Covid-19 over the past two years, it is clear from our research that the legacy of this disease is going to be huge,” said Rachael Evans, one of the study’s authors. The team stressed their results show there is now an urgent need to develop ways to tackle long Covid. “Without effective treatments, long Covid could become a highly prevalent long-term condition,” said Professor Chris Brightling, another author. The research, which will be presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) in Lisbon on Sunday, involved the analysis of more than 2,000 individuals from 39 NHS hospitals who had been admitted after contracting Covid-19. Follow-up assessments of their health were made after five months and then again after one year. “We found that only 25% of people who had been hospitalised with Covid-19 had fully recovered five months after they had been discharged, a figure that increased only slightly – to 29% – after a year,” said Evans. “That was a very limited rate of recovery in terms of improvements in mental health, organ impairment and quality of life. It was striking.” Being female, being obese and having had mechanical ventilation while in hospital were all associated with even poorer rates of recovery. “If you are a man, you are more likely to be hospitalised if you get Covid-19 but have a [higher] chance of feeling better when you get out,” added Evans. “We found being female and obese were major risk factors for not recovering after a year.” A critical factor in these poor rates of recovery was the lack of treatments that exist for long Covid, added Professor Louise Wain, who was also involved in the study. “No specific therapeutics exist for long Covid and our data highlights that effective interventions are urgently required.” The researchers also found that many of those reporting impairment in the wake of their hospitalisation were suffering from persistent inflammation. “That suggests these groups might respond to anti-inflammatory strategies,” added Wain. The widespread impact of Covid-19 on the health of Britain was underlined last week when the Office for National Statistics published figures suggesting that more than seven in 10 people in England have now been infected with the disease since the start of the pandemic. This estimate, based on testing a sample of more than 500,000 individuals, indicates that 71% of the population in England had caught Covid between 27 April 2020 and 11 February 2022. However, this figure is likely to be an underestimate, given the impact of the most recent Omicron wave of infections which reached their highest prevalence after February. “The number of infected people was rising rapidly when the data stopped. The bottom line is the majority of people in the UK have had Covid-19,” said Prof James Naismith, the director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at the University of Oxford. The ONS also revealed that Covid cases are falling across the country, indicating that the latest wave of the disease has peaked. About 3.8 million people were estimated to be infected last week, compared with a peak of 4.9 million a month ago when case numbers reached their highest level since the pandemic began.",News/World news,Only 29% of UK Covid hospital patients recover within a year,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/only-29-of-uk-covid-hospital-patients-recover-within-a-year
4/24/2022,"PJ Harvey is about to read a poem from her new book, Orlam – we are in her publisher’s offices which are strangely empty (are they all working from home?) and have the top floor to ourselves. She is perched daintily on a chair and looks out, at intervals, at a panoramic view of London with Saint Paul’s as its centrepiece. She divides her life these days between London and Dorset, and is wearing familiar, trendy Londoner uniform – all-in-black with plain ankle boots – clothes that give nothing away but draw attention to her face, to her extraordinary hazel eyes and elegant eyebrows that look like bold brushstrokes. Her bow mouth has an enigmatic character as if she judges it wise to keep her best jokes to herself. Her wavy, jet-black hair goes, as it always has done, its own way. She is effortlessly beautiful – in no way manufactured or overdone. The first impression, this morning, is of a shy, warm, natural Dorset girl and it is a stretch to believe that she is also a glorious chameleon of a singer with an international following, one-time muse of Nick Cave and double winner of the Mercury prize – it is an incongruous double-take – as if Patti Smith were revealed to be Tess of the d’Urbervilles. Yet PJ Harvey is not like anyone else. The photographer Giles Duley, who collaborated on the video for her single The Camp, notes that she “reinvents herself and embraces each new project completely. She is dedicated to her craft. I’ve never seen a more powerful presence on stage.” Michael Morris, associate director of the arts organisation Artangel, with whom she has also worked, goes further: “She is an artist for whom thought, feeling and a powerful sense of place merge to make singular worlds. All artists are explorers, but she ventures into uncharted territory, beyond the foothills of the imagination.” Sasha Frere-Jones, reviewing her last album in the New Yorker, is no more restrained in suggesting that her singing voice is nothing less than “an ambassador for the libido”. It seems unfeasible that PJ Harvey should now be 52 – and it is wonderful to see how undeterred she is by age. She lets slip that she has a new album coming out next year and, although not supposed to be talking about it, allows herself to say: “I’m really pleased with it – and I’m my own harshest critic.” Orlam, our reason for meeting, is not her first attempt at poetry (she published The Hollow of the Hand, an accompaniment to photographs by Seamus Murphy, in 2015) but it marks her debut as a poet of stature. I confess I was surprised to find the poems extraordinarily good – it seemed unreasonable to hope for a double helping of talent (or triple helping, actually – for she is also an artist, the illustrated edition of her poems will be published in October). Orlam has been eight years in the making, overseen by her mentor, editor and friend, the poet Don Paterson. The rhyming narrative is not autobiographical yet the poems centre on nine-year-old Ira-Abel Rawles growing up in Dorset – as she did herself. Orlam is an all-seeing lamb’s eyeball and Ira’s guardian. It is an absorbing, singular, profound tale, set in the imaginary village of Underwhelem, and the first book in decades to make use of Dorset dialect (each poem is accompanied with a standard English version on the facing page). Much of the writing has the rhythm of a spell – as if to stir cauldrons as well as hearts. I close my eyes as she starts to read… ReapingOnce a spileful seed was sown.All must be cut down once grown.Men shall vall beneath the elm,Under ethly overwhelm.Freen from fleshy, freen from bloods,All our shades flit to the woods.Evemen holds em in ’es gloam,Chalky children take em hwome,Merge em with the meesh, an’ leaves,Conjure us to silent sheaves. It comes as no surprise that she knows how to perform this perfectly: her voice hushed, precise, with an unforced sense of rhythm (spileful is barley, fleshy is flesh, meesh is moss). It is a poem with a steadiness about death that would not have shamed Dorset’s greatest poet, Thomas Hardy. I tell her I disappeared into her poems as though into an unsafe wood and wish we could be meeting amid the stitchwort, moss and ferns she describes. She laughs, agrees and says she has carried the book’s landscape with her as if in “a parallel universe. Every moment of my day, it was running alongside me. I was so involved in the journey it was taking me on that everything I did, everything I saw, was tinged with this other world I’d entered.” I love the way she pronounces “world” with that rolling “r”. I could listen to that Dorset burr for ever – or until the sheep (there are flocks of them in her book) came home. “There is a huge difference,” she has discovered, “between composing lyrics and writing poetry. Poetry needs to create an entire world on the page without musical accompaniment, through form, rhyme, metre and tone. A song lyric can be a very light brushstroke because the music is supplying emotion and atmosphere, and helps the lyric come across.” When her album Let England Shake (2011) came out, the Guardian’s critic Alexis Petridis ended his review with the judgment that it might be a “creative peak” and mused, “Where she goes from here is, as ever, anyone’s guess.” The album was an exploration of Englishness with harrowing insights into war and she now explains the pull to retreat into poetry: “I needed to bring back the scale of my writing to something more interior. With Let England Shake, I’d been looking outwardly to explore what was happening in the world. On an emotional level, I felt this great need to rest and nourish myself.” PJ Harvey is said to be interview-shy (and this is the first she has done for 10 years) but I am struck by how conversational, curious and amused she is – with a lovely ripple of a laugh. She shows no sign of sitting as if in a dentist’s chair waiting for the interview to be over. Yet she is private (as a young woman, she had a rough ride with interviewers pressing her on a possible eating disorder, a breakdown and her relationship with Nick Cave – all ancient history now). You could say the preference for privacy was evident from the moment, in 1991, that she opted to use initials for her band (P for Polly, J for Jean). I wonder how she accounts for the contrast between the extroversion of performance and the privacy of the page? “I need both.” So would she say she was shy? “Yes – I think of myself as an introverted person. A lot of artists are like this. If you’re not very good at expressing yourself, you need to find another way of doing it. My way has been through song, drawing and – now – poetry.” The importance of Dorset to her – and to her work – cannot be overstated. She grew up in Corscombe, “a very small village”, on a smallholding with cows, sheep, chickens and dogs. Her parents, Ray and Eva Harvey, owned a quarrying business (in an artistic sense, she is a quarrier, too). “It was wonderful – my brother and I were free to roam and play. We lived in our imagination. Our wonderful parents encouraged this.” If I had encountered her at nine, I’d have clapped eyes on “a scruffy child, covered in straw or soaked from the waist down from falling into the river.” She was five when she wrote her first poem: “I wrote it at the bottom of the garden, by the river, in my little notepad, it was about a fox – and I was taking on the fox’s voice… I was the fox,” she laughs. “I still have it somewhere because my grandmother saved it. When she died, I found it and was so touched that she had kept it.” But she is at pains to point out that her childhood was not merely a bucolic idyll: “You’re aware, from a very early age, of the cycle of life and death and quickly learn that rhythm.” And this is the rhythm of her poetry, too. There is a recognition of nature’s cruelty. And yet for her, as for many a poet before her, nature is “crucial – a restoration of my spirit”. She explains: “Dorset is light and dark, ecstasy and melancholy. If you stand at the top of Eggardon Hill, you feel your heart come open with beauty. But if you’re in a valley that doesn’t get much light, you feel this beautiful melancholy.” It is refreshing to hear her acknowledge melancholy unquestioningly as part of the human lot. In one poem, she suggests melancholy can be “eased” by writing. She finds creating music a comfort, too. And whenever she feels overcast, she walks, sees art, reads Seamus Heaney’s poetry, listens to Bach or to Beethoven sonatas that “restore the soul when it needs restoring”. She also turns to friends. When she says “Friendship is my biggest strength”, I don’t doubt it. On the subject of the Dorset dialect, she shows me a copy of William Barnes’s 1886 glossary – her source for the poems – and talks about him as if he were an old friend. She is sweetly proud of his achievement in collecting a dialect that was, even then, dying out. “Dialect is a great tool for poetry because words take on different connotations,” she adds. And we home in on some old words such as “drisk” which means “mist” and has the strangest edge. “Isn’t it beautiful?”, she says. Throughout her career, PJ Harvey has been an activist and it is striking how often in her projects, such as the film A Dog Called Money, in which she travelled with Seamus Murphy to Kosovo, Afghanistan and Washington DC, she prefers to be a respectful bystander, never jostling for centre stage. Duley says: “Her work in speaking out against the realities of war and foreign policy has been extraordinary in its scope and bravery.” I wonder, inevitably, how the war in Ukraine is affecting her? “It is terribly upsetting on a daily basis,” she says, adding that she is sure a need to express her “sadness, anger and frustration” will come out in whatever work she does next. “I’m frightened by the human capacity for cruelty. I think: how can that possibly be happening? And when you can’t understand something, it’s most frightening.” And this from someone who, as a performer, is not frightened at all: “I never think of performance as something I have to be brave about. I’ve always felt driven to do it. I have to walk this path. It might sound almost mystical but I see it as a calling.” It is telling that she should touch on the mystical. Her poetry mixes paganism with Christianity. “I like to see the possibility of everything: no God – lots of Gods,” she explains. “I don’t dismiss anything as ridiculous or unbelievable. As a child, I thought of God as the land itself. I’d imagine a large hill was the tiny, moley bump on God’s leg…” She laughs. She is also an authority on ancient superstition (I am intrigued to learn from her poetry that carrying an ash leaf was considered lucky). But she is not superstitious herself except, as she concedes with a laugh, about the bad luck of breaking mirrors: “I suppose we’re afraid of it because a mirror is the thing we look at our image in and if it smashes…” She does not finish the sentence but it leads me to ask about her image. What is it like to make her peace with middle age – having been such a siren? “It’s hard. It’s a process of acceptance. In your late 40s, you realise you have to start letting go of the way you used to be, the way your body used to be, the way your face used to look. It’s a humbling experience. But you need to embrace it. And I have to say I’m enjoying getting older – for the letting go. When you’re young, you worry so much about appearance and what people will think. You’re full of anxiety but, as you get older, you can let go of that and it is incredibly freeing.” She sounds content. And she starts to talk about a future dream in which, one day, she will live on a Dorset smallholding again – and will come full circle. She knows about the importance of endings in life and in poetry: “When I’ve read the ending of a great poem, I catch my breath… In my own poems, I don’t want to tell people what to feel. I want to open the doorway so they can find out for themselves. It can be hard to know when a poem is finished. But once finished, it’s finished – it’s of its time and place. And I will have the desire – always – to move forward and to do something else.”  Orlam is published by Picador on 28 April (£16.99).

4/24/2022,"It’s hardly a secret that pro-Europeans are on edge across the continent, anxiously worrying whether Emmanuel Macron will win today’s French presidential election. His challenger, Marine Le Pen, is openly prepared to subvert the EU to propagate her vision of a reborn autarchic, nationalist France even ready to partner strategically with Russia. The EU’s capacity to drive forward internally and externally, so crucial given the mountainous challenges facing the continent, not least the war in Ukraine, would collapse. So would the cohesion of the west. As matters stand, it looks as though Macron will make it. But British pessimists worry that the EU may not be safe for long. Whether we’re talking about inflation, the cost of living crisis, weaning Europe off Russian energy, holding a common line against Vladimir Putin or protecting EU values against attacks from rightwing populists, the EU faces some of the most formidable challenges since the Second World War – with structures that are scarcely fit for purpose. In France, Macron is constitutionally forbidden from standing again in 2027. With the collapse of the traditional “republican” left and right parties, a Le Pen or successor facing an opponent with less swagger and sense of mission than Macron might have a real chance. Much of French politics now depends on whether France’s improving economic performance follows through to show benefits that are sufficiently visible – and whether the EU is seen no less visibly to be a source of strength. Here, a newly elected Macron will need the unflinching support of Germany, a country itself, for all its deeply held pro-European convictions, beset by its own tensions and ghosts. Bild Zeitung, Germany’s bestselling rightwing tabloid, has labelled Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, “Madame Inflation” as eurozone inflation hits 7.5%, while the 86-year-old veteran hawk of both the Bundesbank and European Central Bank, Otmar Issing, has accused the guardians of European price stability as living in a “fantasy”. German inflation has not been as high for more than 70 years. It was hyperinflation in the 1920s that opened the door to Hitler. Other Europeans may admire the success of liberal capitalism and democracy in postwar Germany, but Germans themselves worry the gains are precarious and that old demons could be easily stirred – paradoxically by the EU they so cherish. Last May, Olaf Scholz, then the German finance minister and now the chancellor, hailed the just launched ambitious EU Covid-recovery plan as Europe’s “Hamiltonian moment”. EU member states would guarantee the issue of EU bonds on an unprecedented scale to finance investment in green and digital technologies, along with social resilience measures to better manage future pandemics, just as the US’s first treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton, pioneered the federal government’s guarantee of state debts to cement the newly created USA. Macron, who had fought hard for the fund, was equally delighted. The EU had shown its mettle; a rubicon had been crossed. If he wins, be sure Macron will come back for more. But the Ukraine war and epic inflation are shaking Germany. Underwriting EU bonds looks less clever as German criticism of the European Central Bank mounts for swamping the EU’s financial system with cheap cash – and now the country has to navigate the exceptional cost of weaning itself off Russian oil and gas. It opposes an EU-inspired immediate ban on Russian oil and gas imports; economics minister, Robert Halbeck, warned this would “create mass unemployment, poverty, people who can’t heat their homes and would run out of petrol” . But even the phased ban that the EU will soon announce risks a German recession and a squeeze on living standards. Germany must simultaneously fund its own energy transition and a vast defence build-up. Its appetite for more “Hamiltonian” EU-wide measures that Macron and the rest of Europe so badly need is going to be limited. The prospect of fudge and the continued rise of rightwing populism look all too real. Except, except. British commentary on Europe always emphasises what is going wrong – rarely what is going right. Yes, there are profound challenges in France, Germany and the EU. But set besides the US facing a resurgence of know-nothing Trumpism and Britain confronting a Brexit-induced collapse in its trade, an investment crisis, endemic stagflation and a constitutional impasse, these challenges look comparatively tame. What is impressive about the EU is that, unlike the US and UK, the centre is holding. The mainstream French and German political classes, along with those in Spain, Italy, Holland and beyond, know the EU is a crucial bulwark. And they stand by it. After a faltering start, the EU weathered Covid well and in most respects better than Britain – as a collective political organisation. Fewer deaths; stronger vaccination programmes; better support for hard-hit, less developed countries. The EU recovery plan was a Hamiltonian moment and across Europe is proving a stimulus to some of the best thought through investment policies in decades. The European Central Bank may have misjudged inflationary pressures, but so did the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England. These pressures are likely to ease in Europe, helped by the strength of the euro with its reserve currency status, while British inflationary pressures will remain more protracted as sterling’s recent decline accelerates with our weakening economy. The collapse in British trade has shown the value of the EU’s single market, while strong EU measures to push Facebook and Google to regulate what is on their platforms more aggressively would be impossible to enforce by single states. What’s more, Russia’s likely gains in southern and eastern Ukraine underline the need for the EU to stand together. Europe’s leaders know all this. The greater crisis is not in the EU, which will weather its problems because of that political will. It is the abject failure of Brexit and the all too slow process of ousting a prime minister deceiving the House of Commons on which the integrity of British democracy depends. If Macron wins, it will be a signal that Europe is getting through its worst – while Britain has yet to touch bottom.

4/24/2022,"One quality that has sustained BalletBoyz, the company founded by the original Boyz, Michael Nunn and William Trevitt, has been their determination to explore different dynamics in dance. For proof, note this programme, originally designed for their 20th anniversary in 2020, which asks two female choreographers to work with this all-male company. Another characteristic is their crusading desire to make dance as approachable as possible, evidenced here with their cheeky, trademark films that introduce the pieces. It adds up to an intriguing evening. In an interview, the Chinese choreographer Xie Xin communicates her doubts about her ability to transmit the flow of energy she wants. Yet the result in Ripple, her first work in the UK, is a transfixing triumph, full of subtle effects. Dressed in monkish garments, the dancers bend and turn in flowing circles, in groups and pairs, accompanied by Jiang Shaofeng’s textured score. They reflect each other’s movements, supporting deep bows of the back and legs, subtle waves of the arm and hand. The fluidity of their bodies astonishes; sometimes they seem to hold themselves just above the floor, as if suspended. Sometimes they wheel on a single arm or leg. It’s impossible to look away. Bradley 4:18, choreographed by Punchdrunk’s Maxine Doyle, couldn’t be more different. Inspired by a Kae Tempest poem and danced to Cassie Kinoshi’s scratchy, swooning jazz, it features six dancers in identical sharp suits, embodying different aspects – pugnacious, preening, anxious – of a man’s personality. The movement, under Andrew Ellis’s harsh, four-in-the-morning light, is sharp and punchy, catching Bradley’s arrogant swagger, but also his deep self-doubt. Bar one, the dancers are all new to these works, and like successive teams of Boyz before them, both charismatic and talented. The audience, on a quiet bank holiday Monday, went wild.

4/24/2022,"Survivors of South Africa’s devastating floods have described “sheet upon sheet of relentless rain” that washed away entire houses, bridges and roads, killing about 450 people and making thousands homeless. The storm, which delivered close to an entire year’s usual rainfall in 48 hours, took meteorologists by surprise and has been blamed by experts on climate change. The new disaster comes after three tropical cyclones and two tropical storms hit south-east Africa in just six weeks in the first months of this year. The full extent of the devastation caused by the floods in South Africa this month is yet to become clear, with many victims still missing and authorities still learning of new damage around the eastern coastal city of Durban. Many tens of thousands of people remain without water, and there are rising concerns about an outbreak of infectious disease. Uzair Ismail, 35, said he had been forced to flee his home in central Durban with his wife and eight-year-old when water and mud flooded in through doors, windows and plumbing in the middle of the night when the storm struck almost two weeks ago. “We were lucky to get out alive … Slowly, slowly we had built ourselves up to a livable home with a few possessions and we had left everything. But others lost much more. We are safe at least,” Ismail told the Guardian. Some families were almost entirely wiped out in the disaster, losing eight or 10 members. The South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, described a “catastrophe of enormous proportions” and attributed the disaster to the climate emergency. “It is telling us that climate change is serious, it is here,” Ramaphosa said as he visited the flooded metropolitan area of eThekwini, which includes Durban, shortly after the floods. “We no longer can postpone what we need to do, and the measures we need to take to deal with climate change.” Others have echoed Ramaphosa’s warning. “This is just the beginning of a series of extreme weather events that are linked to climate change … Africa pollutes least and suffers most from climate change,” said Ibrahima Cheikh Diong, the director general of African Risk Capacity, an agency set up by the African Union to help governments better plan for disasters and mitigate their impact. Poor people living in makeshift settlements built on unstable, steep-sided gorges around Durban were worst affected by the floods. Most have inadequate or no drainage systems and homes are sometimes flimsy shacks that offer little protection against the elements. Fernaaz Hussain, a 35-year-old coordinator for aid agency Islamic Relief, who lives in Durban, said she had first thought the rain was just part of the city’s tropical weather, but became worried when it did not stop. “It was just relentless. There was just sheet after sheet and you couldn’t see anything beyond. It just did not stop. It just got worse and worse. I have never seen anything like it in my life. The rain was so heavy and the wind so strong we feared the windows [would] break,” Hussain said. She described shipping containers floating down motorways and an oil tanker washed up on Durban’s famous beach. “You can’t do anything to help yourself. You feel just totally powerless. And tomorrow it could happen again and there’s nothing we could do,” she said. Experts say the impact of the climate crisis is increasingly obvious across Africa, with tens of millions suffering from drought in the Sahel and parts of east Africa, while the continent’s southeastern coast is hit by intense storms. The World Weather Attribution (WWA) network of scientists, which has pioneered ways to understand the causes of extreme weather events, said climate change had made the heavy rains along Africa’s south eastern coastline both heavier and more likely. “Again we are seeing how the people with the least responsibility for climate change are bearing the brunt of the impacts,” said WWA co-founder Friederike Otto, of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London. After Tropical Storm Ana smashed into the region in January, Tropical Cyclone Batsirai hit Madagascar in early February, followed in quick succession by Tropical Storm Dumako and Tropical Cyclones Emnati and Gombe. WWA scientists used weather observations and computer simulations to compare rainfall patterns under today’s climate to that of the pre-industrial area, before global heating. They focused on two of the wettest periods – during Storm Ana in Malawi and Mozambique and during Cyclone Batsirai in Madagascar. “In both cases, the results show that rainfall associated with the storms was made more intense by climate change and that episodes of extreme rainfall such as these have become more frequent,” WWA said in a report of their findings. Their conclusions matched broader climate research showing that global heating can increase the frequency and intensity of rainfall, though determining exactly how much climate change influences the extreme events is made difficult by a shortage of high quality historical rainfall records for the region. The South African Weather Service said that although it was impossible to attribute an individual event to the climate crisis, “globally, all forms of severe and extreme weather … are becoming more frequent and more extreme than in the recent past (as a direct result of global warming and associated climate change). In other words, heavy rain events such as the current incident can … be expected to recur in the future and with increasing frequency.” Many countries in Africa are poorly prepared for such disasters. Though the most industrialised country on the continent, South Africa has struggled to deliver timely and efficient help to flood victims. One reason for the shortage of water among those displaced by the floods in and around Durban there is that around half of the local government’s fleet of 100 water tankers were found to be inoperable when officials ordered their deployment last week. Thousands of troops have now been deployed to assist the aid operation. Analysts say extreme weather events can contribute to political instability across the continent. In South Africa, repeated failure to offer timely and effective relief to victims has exacerbated a general lack of faith in the African National Congress, in power since 1994. “It’s just been normal people helping each other. I’ve had more support from strangers. I won’t even ask the government. The funds always go missing and never reach the right people,” said Husain. Police have been forced to use teargas to disperse protesters angry at a lack of assistance from authorities. “It is only because ANC officials regularly fail to care in desperate moments such as these that so many people are convinced that the party is hopelessly corrupt and that even the flood relief funds will be stolen,” wrote commentator Stephen Grootes in an editorial on the Daily Maverick news website. Sean Christie of Médecins Sans Frontières said the NGO was working with local health authorities to supply nurses and counsellors to flood victims. “On psychosocial mental health, we have seen lots and lots of need,” he told the Guardian.",News/World news,"After the relentless rain, South Africa sounds the alarm on the climate crisis",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/south-africa-floods-rain-climate-crisis-extreme-weather
4/24/2022,"Scientists have uncovered evidence that dangerous versions of superbugs can spread from pigs to humans. The discovery underlines fears that intensive use of antibiotics on farms is leading to the spread of microbes resistant to them. The discovery of the link has been made by Semeh Bejaoui and Dorte Frees of Copenhagen University and Soren Persson at Denmark’s Statens Serum Institute and focuses on the superbug Clostridioides difficile, which is considered one of the world’s major antibiotic resistance threats. “Our finding indicates that C difficile is a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes that can be exchanged between animals and humans,” said Bejaoui, who is due to present her study at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases in Lisbonon Sunday. “This alarming discovery suggests that resistance to antibiotics can spread more widely than previously thought, and confirms links in the resistance chain leading from farm animals to humans.” C difficile infects the human gut and is resistant to all but three antibiotics in use today. Some strains contain genes that allow them to produce toxins that can trigger gut inflammation and life-threatening diarrhoea in the elderly and in hospital patients. The bacterium is considered one of the biggest antibiotic resistance threats in developed countries. In the US, it caused an estimated 223,900 infections and 12,800 deaths in 2017 and cost the healthcare system more than $1bn. Doctors and scientists have warned for years that over-prescribing antibiotics for trivial complaints or infections caused by viruses which do not respond to antibiotics threatens to lead to the spread of resistance to this critically important class of drugs. In addition, they have stressed that the problem is being intensified by the widespread use of antibiotics on farms where they are given to animals – most often pigs and poultry but sometimes also cattle – in order to keep them in poor, basic conditions where disease spreads easily. The result has been a rapid increase in antimicrobial resistance across the world. Once-effective antibiotics are now less able to fight common infections, a danger to global health that was summed up by Margaret Chan, former director general of the World Health Organization. “Antimicrobial resistance is on the rise in Europe and elsewhere in the world,” she said. “We are losing our first-line antimicrobials. Replacement treatments are more costly, more toxic, need much longer durations of treatment, and may require treatment in intensive care units.” It is estimated about 750,000 people die every year from drug-resistant infections and it is feared that, by 2050, this number could reach 10 million and cost more than $100tn to global health services, according to the Union for International Cancer Control. These fears have led to pressure being put on doctors to reduce prescription of antibiotics and so slow the rise of antimicrobial resistance. However, medical authorities have pointed out that two-thirds of antibiotics are not used on humans at all but are given as agricultural additives. This is done to stave off illnesses and infections in animals that are being kept in conditions that would otherwise cause disease. In their research, the team led by Bejaoui focused on investigating the prevalence of C difficile in farm animals. In this case, pigs were studied and results were compared with clinical isolates from Danish hospital patients to see if there was a match in humans. Samples were screened for the presence of C difficile and genetic sequencing was used to identify whether they harboured toxin and drug resistance genes. “We found that the strains isolated in pigs were genetically identical to the ones found in humans over the same period,” Bejaoui said. “We have still to show that the strains were passed from pigs to humans but what our study does make clear is that farms that use antibiotics are creating conditions which allow resistant strains to flourish and these will ultimately infect humans. “Of particular concern is the large reservoir of genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, a class of antibiotics to which C difficile is intrinsically resistant. It thus plays a role in spreading these genes to other susceptible species. This study provides more evidence on the evolutionary pressure connected with the use of antimicrobials in animal husbandry, which selects for dangerously resistant human pathogens.”",News/Society,"Pigs can pass deadly superbugs to people, study reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/24/pigs-can-pass-deadly-superbugs-to-people-study-reveals
4/24/2022,"London, city of my birth, and not a street in Zone 1 without a memory attached to it. It’s wet and grey and I’ve mistimed appointments, so instead of the gentle ambling and browsing that I had planned, I am dodging the rain and trying to dry out in small corners of shops, steam rising from me like a just-baked loaf. This sort of weather reminds me of indoor playtimes at school, safety, and the promise of my Ma at the end of it with a Danish pastry. Bittersweet. I have missed my turning to William Curley’s chocolate emporium in Smith’s Court (just behind Piccadilly Circus and really hard to find, but worth finding), which is a shame as I fancied a hot chocolate and a nostalgia bar. On I go through Soho, first to Silver Place where I used to work in a haunted underground office, round the corner from where they filmed bits of Sid and Nancy, then the John Snow pub on the corner of Broadwick Street – scene of a first date. Then, imminently missable but not to be missed, is Said, an Italian chocolate shop further along Broadwick Street, that’s really famous for its hot chocolate. Incredibly, there is no queue and the waitress ushers me in, seeming to sense I need a bit of TLC, and to the coveted window seat, small and cosy with a view on to the wet world outside. The hot chocolate here comes in three sizes, starting at £3.50, in dark, milk or gianduja. You could – and I should have – opted for the three-chocolate sauce addition.

4/24/2022,"You get the sense that Spiritualized’s Jason Pierce is actively signposting his latest album’s charms. Everything Was Beautiful’s medication-style packaging echoes that of the band’s 1997 classic, Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space, as does the female voice that announces the record (then: former band member Kate Radley, now: Pierce’s daughter Poppy); the astronaut’s eye-view of human fallibility is here too. One of the chief pleasures of Spiritualized, now as then, is the sweet din Pierce and his accomplices can create – a millefeuille of influences, counter-currents, drones and melodies layered magnificently but unsteadily upon one another. This ninth outing is Pierce’s most assured in some time, doling out extra helpings of heady patisserie. More than half the album is devoted to elegiac maximalism, with blaring jazz brass over mantric repetitions (The A Song (Laid in Your Arms), ecstatic keyboards over RSI-inducing train rhythms (The Mainline Song) or the punishing orchestral wallop of Let It Bleed (for Iggy), in which Pierce sings tenderly of not being able to accurately render the depth of his feeling before finding the right key change.

4/24/2022,"The buskers are out, hotels are full, archaeological sites are heaving, shopkeepers are smiling, and good luck if you want a table in a decent restaurant. It might be April but Athens is alive to the sound of tourists. In all his years keeping watch over 1st-century BC ruins, Stelios Ballas, who is in his 50s, can barely recall so many visitors picking their way through the scattered antiquities of the Roman agora. “These past few weeks have been something else,” he says from his guard’s cabin nestled under a plane tree. “I talk to some of them and they seem to be from everywhere. The thing is, do they have money and are they willing to spend it?” Around the corner on Adrianou Street, the Greek capital’s oldest commercial thoroughfare, restaurateurs are not asking that question – for now. Not since 2019, when Greece attracted a record 33 million holidaymakers, has business been as good. “If it goes on like this we’ll be talking about a brilliant year,” smiles Vassilis Stathokostopoulos, who runs the recently upgraded all-day bistro Ydria. “Perhaps it’s our new chef but people are not only coming, it’s clear that after everything we’ve all been through, they want to have a good time. And for that they’re willing to dig deep into their pockets.” In a country so dependent on tourism – the sector accounts for 25% of Greece’s economic output and one in four jobs – the rebound has surprised even those who are in the business of being optimistic. Athens has seen more upheaval in recent years than other EU metropolises, hit first by a near decade-long financial crisis that made its streets synonymous with protests and riots before the coronavirus struck. The pandemic-induced hiatus resulted in tourist revenues dropping from €18.2bn in 2019 to €4bn in 2020 when, in a record slump, the nation logged only 7 million arrivals. Although earnings from the industry exceeded €10bn, better than expected, last year when Greece opened its borders in May, they were still well short of pre-pandemic takings. But this year, despite the unexpected spectre of war returning to Europe in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, industry figures are confident that recovery has finally come. For the first time since 2019 cruise ships are pulling into Greek ports – testimony, say industry officials, to the desire of travellers to put the pandemic behind them. Pre-paid flight bookings are also on the rise. “All omens look positive,” says Andreas Andreadis, a former tourism boss and chief executive of the phenomenally successful Sani/Ikos group of luxury resorts. “For a few weeks after the start of the war in Ukraine demand dropped but since the end of March it has picked up and is now excellent.” Holidaymakers, he says, are still less inclined given the spread of Covid to travel long-haul, preferring destinations in Europe. “And the truth is there are not so many options with quality destinations,” he says. In an unprecedented step aimed at capitalising on the hunger of people to travel, the tourist season kicked off earlier in Greece this year. Last week, officials announced that pandemic restrictions, including the requirement of presenting an EU digital Covid certificate to enter the Mediterranean nation, would be lifted from 1 May and reviewed in September. What was seen as Athens’ relatively successful handling of the pandemic last year has also helped revive the sector, despite public health authorities registering a sharp rise in Covid deaths since because of lower vaccination rates. “The season has begun earlier than ever before,” says Vasilis Kikilias, the Greek tourism minister, noting that the first direct flight from the US, a key market for the economy, flew in on 7 March. “It’s a vote of confidence in our country.” The decision to open earlier appears to have paid off: bookings soared over Easter. As Greeks also prepare to mark the holiday – returning en masse to their ancestral villages for the first time since the outbreak of the pandemic to celebrate the most important religious event in the Orthodox calendar – authorities say they show no sign of tapering off. Airlines, says Kikilias, are not only competing over slots to Greece this summer, but 765 cruise ships are lined up to anchor in ports around the country, with popular island destinations such as Mykonos, Kos and Corfu already drawing crowds. “It’s a fact borne out by every study that people don’t just want to travel, they need to travel,” says Eugenios Vasilikos, the vice-president of the Panhellenic Federation of Hoteliers. “All the signs point to this being a very good year.” By 2023, the capital will have acquired an additional 5,000 hotel rooms compared with 2019 when a city once bypassed for the islands managed to attract 5 million visitors. The investment frenzy, evident in a construction boom now changing the face of downtown Athens, is also indicative of the hopes entrepreneurs have placed in the revival of Greece’s heavy industry. But Vasilikos, at the hoteliers’ federation, concedes there is little room for complacency. The glimpse of a carefree world that has revisited Athens as tourists amble through its sites and streets is also fraught with the dangers inherent in a cost of living crisis and spiralling inflation rates being felt globally. Unions representing Greeks who earn some of the lowest wages in the European Union have taken to the streets. “A few weeks ago I might not have been so optimistic,” he says of reservations in the capital. “All the data points to last-minute bookings in our hotels which while costs are rising also have some of the lowest price rates in Europe. People aren’t sure of anything any more. They wait until the last minute, and, in the last minute, anything can change.”",News/World news,‘All omens look positive’: Greece is grateful as the tourists flock back,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/all-omens-look-positive-greece-grateful-tourists-flock-back
4/24/2022,"Humidity is makeup’s arch-nemesis. And as we approach the summer, you might realise your trusty foundation is no longer up to scratch. Instead, it will slip and slide on your face, feel cakey, block your pores… Your skin will scream, it wants to breathe. Teamed with the fact that beauty trends of the moment are pushing the all-natural mascara and lip colour combo, we are under attack to bare it all – and let’s be honest, some of us are not there, which is absolutely fine. Enter the lightweight foundation. It gives slightly more coverage than a BB “blemish balm”, but it is still airy and durable. It’s the answer to a flawless complexion with the least layers. First, however, it’s crucial to get the right balance. Glowing is good, but shiny is not. The trick is finding a water-resistant solution; this will help with sweat and oils melting away your makeup. Lean into that dewy look as, naturally, that is what your face is going to want to do when the sun hits it. And yes, dewy skin for summer isn’t groundbreaking – but if it isn’t broken, why fix it? 1.

4/24/2022,"Boris Johnson once explained his desire to go into politics by saying: “They don’t put up statues to journalists.” I’m doubtful that anyone other than himself is planning one, but his place in history is definitely set in stone. He has earned the dismal distinction of being both the first prime minister to have been given a criminal sanction while in office and the first to be placed under investigation for contempt of parliament. After being fined by the police for breaking the life-or-death laws he himself introduced to curb Covid, the privileges committee will adjuicate on his repeated false denials to the Commons. Britain has had some dicey leaders before, but no previous incumbent has generated such a double-whammy of disgraces, either of which would have impelled the resignation of any of his predecessors. Rather than moving out, he wants everyone else to move on. But there can be no moving on from this scandal as a matter of principle and practice. His misconduct goes to the heart of the integrity of our politics. Can a law-breaker be the country’s chief law-maker? And can a prime minister who has repeatedly and flagrantly misled parliament remain in office? Every day that they allow him to stay there, Tory MPs are choosing to say yes to both those questions. By doing so, the supposed party of law and order makes itself complicit in grave offences that have always previously been regarded as automatic grounds for removal, poisons the public trust in our democracy and sets an atrocious precedent. To be fair to the Conservatives, some of them are greatly troubled that they are led by a rogue prime minister. The Tory ranks contain people with a moral compass who still attach importance to standards in public life. Their voice was expressed by David Wolfson when he resigned as a justice minister, saying the government can only “credibly defend democratic norms abroad, especially at a time of war in Europe, if we are, and are seen to be, resolutely committed both to the observance of the law and also to the rule of law”. It is also fair to say that plenty of Tory MPs lose not a wink of sleep over the principles at stake. Otherwise, Mr Johnson would be long gone, rather than clinging on to Number 10 like a grubby piece of chewing gum stuck to the sole of the shoe of the constitution. Yet even those Tory MPs who share his disdain for ethical standards must worry that this is not going away. It is reported that the police have started to issue penalty charge notices for the notorious “bring your own booze” party at Number 10 organised by the prime minister’s private secretary. That’s the one Mr Johnson claims he attended because he mistook a garden packed with people chugging alcohol for a “work event”. As I write, we can’t be sure whether or not a second fine is coming his way. The latest batch of police penalties come on top of the 50 fines for offences against Covid safeguards already slapped on the denizens of Downing Street. I have seen no evidence to contradict the assertion that this makes Number 10 the most law-breaking address in the kingdom. And the police have yet to announce their verdict on many of the other Downing Street booze-ups during the pandemic, several of which Mr Johnson is known to have attended. His cynical calculation throughout has been that time will be his saviour. He has assumed that he can blag and bluster his way through this tawdry saga until people become exhausted with it. Time is now turning into his enemy as it dawns on Tory MPs that they will get no respite from this scandal so long as he remains at Number 10. One groaned to me: “It’s never going to end, is it?” Even Johnson loyalists shudder at the prospect of further tranches of police fines triggering further waves of visceral public anger. One recent opinion poll indicates that less than a tenth of voters think he has not lied about partygate. “The longer this goes on, the more the stain spreads to all of us,” observes one senior Tory. A particularly severe anxiety in the prime minister’s circle is how people will react if they get sight of the many photos of Downing Street drinking while people were dying. For headline writers and opposition parties, partygate is the gift that keeps on giving. For the Tory party, it is the shame that just keeps growing. One result is that fewer and fewer of his MPs are willing to act as the prime minister’s human shields by humiliating themselves on his behalf. That was demonstrated during the shenanigans over the reference to the privileges committee. Number 10’s terribly misjudged attempt to stymie an investigation had to be abandoned in the face of a rebellion by Tory MPs fearful of being accused of complicity in a cover-up. When it came to the debate, just one Conservative MP, the prime minister’s former political secretary Danny Kruger, was willing to offer unqualified support while a succession of opposition speakers described Mr Johnson as a law-breaking liar. Never has a prime minister looked so friendless. Tory MPs report that morale is being drained by the fury that they are encountering on the doorstep along with the psychological wear and tear of regurgitating alibis they know to be bogus. William Wragg, who made the finest of the Tory contributions to the debate, remarked: “It is utterly depressing to be asked to defend the indefensible. Each time, part of us withers.” Steve Baker is one of the Tories who has reached the end of his wither. He added his voice to those calling for the prime minister to go – “the gig is up” – on the grounds that he didn’t find his expressions of repentance genuine. Boris Johnson, insincere? Well spotted, Mr Baker. This zealot for Brexit played an instrumental role in getting Mr Johnson to Number 10 in the first place and has a reputation as an organiser. That call for the prime minister to go is also noteworthy because it shows that the anti-Johnson MPs are not confined, as the loyalists would have it, to Remoaners and others who have always loathed him. Those who want him out are now represented on all points of the Tory spectrum. For all that, many of them are still looking for reasons not to act. You know their excuses. Wait for the May elections, wait for the full Sue Gray report, wait to see just how many fines he gets, wait for the party conference, wait for the war in Ukraine to be over, wait while I try to grow a vertebra. The principal explanation for their prevarication is that there is no agreed successor, a dilemma made more acute since the implosion of Rishi Sunak’s reputation robbed the Conservative party of its most obvious alternative. It is true that there is no consensus about who should take over, but then it has very often been the case in the Tory party’s history that it is not clear who will emerge as their next leader until there is a vacancy. In 1940, a lot of Tories thought Winston Churchill would be a disastrous prime minister. It was only hindsight that made him look like the inevitable choice. Very few forecast that Margaret Thatcher would seize the crown before she challenged Ted Heath. It wasn’t obvious much in advance that Alec Douglas-Home, John Major or Theresa May would become prime minister. The events of recent days have exposed ethical impoverishment and spineless paralysis among the Tories. The Conservative party is too scared to back its discredited leader and too scared to sack him. Menacingly to the prime minister, many of his MPs are realising this is unsustainable. “I think the dial has shifted. There are more of us saying we can’t go on like this,” reports one former cabinet minister. “Up with this we will not put.” Another senior Tory agrees: “More colleagues are saying anything will be better than this, anyone has to be better than Boris.” Defenestrating him would be a step into the unknown for the Tories, but a growing band of the party’s despairing MPs are being driven to the conclusion that a leap in the dark is less perilous for them than staying debasingly bound to a doubly disgraced prime minister. No one can be sure when a critical mass of Conservative MPs will decide that enough is enough, but I have the strong sense that more of them have become readier to shove him into the ejector seat.
