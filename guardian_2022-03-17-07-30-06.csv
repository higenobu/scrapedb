3/17/2022,"Liverpool took their chance and, in doing so, showed Arsenal what happens when you fail to do exactly that. While the door to a title race had been left ajar for them on Monday there was always the knowledge in Jürgen Klopp’s mind that winning at the Emirates is a tall order nowadays. That was evident during the first half, when Arsenal were the better side, but the game turned after Martin Ødegaard missed the hosts’ best chance of the night. Within eight minutes Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino had made him regret it and Mikel Arteta was left to reflect on the margins that, as he had warned pre-match, still exist between his team and those at the summit. For Liverpool, who were not at their best, a single-point gap to the lead looks deliciously surmountable. The energy that has spurred Arsenal’s rise from basket case to top-four favourites was encapsulated in the 20th minute when Gabriel Martinelli, sprinting from his wide attacking berth to the midway point in his own half, slid in to stop Trent Alexander-Arnold advancing on the home penalty area. Arsenal are quick starters here and, in heavy rain that only augmented an excitable atmosphere, they set out with intent yet again. There could have been the temptation to regard this as a free hit, given their position would look favourable regardless, but that was never a credible state of mind for Arteta. His side showed when outplaying Manchester City on New Year’s Day that, minus the old niggles that resurfaced to deny them, they can finally compete with the best; turning that level of performance into a victory would hammer home the point that their momentum is becoming irresistible. Arsenal press with a ferocity Klopp would admire and, as a result, Liverpool were smothered for most of the first half. For a few minutes it had not seemed especially likely to be that way: the visitors knew what the prize was and won three corners in the first two minutes, the third coming about after Aaron Ramsdale made a plunging low save from Virgil van Dijk’s free header. Mohamed Salah was not risked from the start after picking up a foot injury at Brighton; that was good news for Arsenal on the face of things but his replacement, Jota, tends to enjoy facing them and scored both goals here in the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg two months ago. Jota was peripheral as Arsenal, for whom Thomas Partey worked tirelessly to deny Fabinho his usual level of control in this fixture, denied Liverpool any meaningful pressure thereafter. This was snappy, knife-edge fare that must have been brutal on the ears of Andrew Madley, the fourth official, as both technical areas cried foul over every remotely contentious challenge. Arsenal might not have created any clear chances before the interval but they could feel happier. Martinelli, a blur of industry, scuffed a half-opening at the far post and then saw a fizzed centre towards Alexandre Lacazette cleared desperately. Bukayo Saka, the first port of call for searching balls from midfield, might have been in on goal had Granit Xhaka not overcooked one pass. Yet Liverpool are only ever one flourish from applying a decisive blow and, with the half’s last action, Sadio Mané could have inflicted one when he lifted over after controlling a long pass. Arsenal should have gone ahead soon after the restart when Lacazette, beating Alisson to Thiago Alcãntara’s undercooked backpass, teed up Ødegaard. The finishing touch is Ødegaard’s only evident weakness these days and he allowed Alisson to recover, deflecting over. Arteta leapt up and down along the touchline. Opportunities like that come along scarcely and perhaps he had foreseen what followed. Sure enough, Thiago got his bearing right within moments: this time he slid Jota through the inside-left channel and, in a mystifying amount of space, the forward drilled inside Ramsdale’s near post. Liverpool were off the hook but it did not spare Jota the chop: Salah had already been stationed to replace him and the substitution proceeded as planned. So did Liverpool’s other change. Firmino took over from the quiet Luis Díaz and, just after the hour, settled things. Robertson charged down a Saka clearance and centred from near the byline; the Brazilian did the rest with a nudged finish and Arteta saw further evidence of the level his players must reach. The game was over, much as Arsenal perspired in search of a way back. Klopp, a visibly anxious figure all night, can smell a return to domestic supremacy.",Sport/Football,Liverpool close gap at top as Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino sink Arsenal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/16/arsenal-liverpool-premier-league-match-report
3/17/2022,"At the ground where the names of the great Barbados and West Indies cricketers adorn the stands Joe Root further burnished his claim to be an English equivalent, finessing his 25th Test century and with it his most enjoyable day of the winter. As the two sides strolled off the field at the close of day one of this second Test the visitors – and the hordes of travelling supporters who have taken over Kensington Oval – should have been by far the happier. Root was unbeaten on 119 from 246 balls and England were well set on 244 for three. But where West Indies might have been tired and chuntering after a day of self-inflicted wounds a late bonus had instead come their way, Jason Holder claiming the wicket of Dan Lawrence for 91 and breaking a third-wicket stand of 164 that was threatening an England record at this ground. Lawrence was crestfallen, slumping to the ground in disbelief after drilling the ball straight to Kraigg Brathwaite in the covers; the Essex right-hander is yet to taste three-figures in Test cricket and a chance to experience this sensation early on the second day had slipped away with one errant drive. It also represented a reprieve unpunished by Lawrence, who seven overs earlier had been dropped on 72 when he flashed hard at a wide one from Jayden Seales only for Alzarri Joseph – a curious deployment at slip – to grass the ball. Having played so well up to this point, it was a lesson to be learned. Instead, Root will walk out with Ben Stokes on the second day after anchoring the first in fine style and, with a second century in the space of a week, further vindicating his positive move up to No 3 despite the statistics saying otherwise. There were a couple of lives along the way, it must be said. West Indies failed to review a fine tickle behind when Root had 23 to his name, while Joshua da Silva, their wicketkeeper, put down a one-handed catch when the England captain glanced a tricky chance down leg on 34. These two chances came within a stand of 76 alongside Alex Lees, who crawled to 30 from 138 balls, but Root seldom looked back, delivering the repertoire of shots that have been the hallmark of his career and bringing up three-figures 40 minutes after tea to the delight his adoring supporters. While Root was as watchable as ever it took the arrival of Lawrence to inject some impetus into the innings. This followed the demise of Lees who, over the course of three hours, had chiselled his way to 33 from 138 balls only to play around one from left-armer spinner Veerasammy Permaul for a simple lbw decision. After two single-figure scores in Antigua on his debut, Lees overcame his tormentor in Kemar Roach and took the shine off the ball for those blessed with more strokes. The opener left plenty, passing up the odd half-volley at times, and made only one misjudgment before his demise when ducking into a short ball from Seales that clanged the side of his helmet. It wasn’t always pretty but it was progress. In his place, and with Root fresh from bringing up his half-century, Lawrence positively crackled. Taking 10 balls to get off the mark, the right‑hander unfurled an array of attacking strokes either side of the tea interval. Those present will remember his whipped six of Permaul, which sailed over midwicket and into the hospitality area in the Hall & Griffith, or the crisp back-to-back fours off Holder that went straight and then through midwicket with a touch of wristy flair thrown in for good measure. This had originally felt like a day for liming, with the pitch lacking zip and the main drama of a morning when England reached 47 for one coming before the start of play; as supporters poured through the turnstiles and into the ground there was the sight of Yorkshire’s Matt Fisher, paint pot in hand, marking out his run-up in glorious sunshine and with a smile as wide as the island. A debut for Saqib Mahmood was already guaranteed when England named their XI a day earlier but here was a surprise second, with Craig Overton having reportedly felt unwell overnight. Cap presentations followed and members of the Fisher family were not just proud as rum punch but also £5,000 richer, after placing £100 on their lad to play for England at odds of 50-1 when he was 14. You have to go back to 2009 at Lord’s against the same opposition for the last time England handed debuts to two seamers in the same Test – Graham Onions and Tim Bresnan – but Fisher and Mahmood had to wait their turn. The loss of Zak Crawley for a seven-ball duck was the only wicket to fall in a session in which neither side otherwise blinked. Seales was the bowler to strike, a fine outswinger feathering the edge of Crawley’s bat when attempting to leave, forcing the opener to join the newcomers on the balcony for a day of watching others make hay in the sunshine.",Sport/Sport,England’s Root and Lawrence take centre stage against West Indies,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/16/englands-root-and-lawrence-take-centre-stage-against-west-indies
3/17/2022,"There is still no guarantee that Chelsea will be able to finish the season, the reality of their precarious situation meaning even the unlikeliest of scenarios coming to pass cannot be ruled out, but by the same token there is every chance that they could yet end it by holding on to their European crown. Stranger things have happened and there will always be hope as long as Chelsea have Thomas Tuchel on the touchline, working out how to bend games in their favour. The German’s side are through to the last eight of the Champions League and Tuchel, whose moral leadership has been so impressive ever since it became clear that Roman Abramovich’s ownership could not continue, will feel the holders have a chance of lifting this trophy again after goals from Christian Pulisic and César Azpilicueta helped them see off a spirited, creative challenge from Lille. After the rows over ticket allocations and the negotiations over travel allowances, how Chelsea must have craved a quiet night. From Tuchel’s perspective there was no need for any drama. Every day has seemed to bring a new form of uncertainty for Chelsea, who felt public sympathy slipping away when they tried to get Saturday’s FA Cup quarter-final against Middlesbrough moved behind closed doors, and Tuchel’s selection suggested that he was not worried about putting on a show, the sight of eight defensive players behind Kai Havertz and Pulisic a clear indication that the visitors were focused on containment over entertainment. It certainly looked like an imposing challenge for Lille, who had created little when they lost the first leg 2-0 last month. The Stade Pierre-Mauroy was a noisy place at kick-off, the home crowd urging their players on, but in truth it was difficult to see how Jocelyn Gourvennec’s side hoped to break Chelsea down at first. N’Golo Kanté, Jorginho, Mateo Kovacic were efficient shields in front of Chelsea’s back five and there was a lack of conviction to Lille when half-chances did arrive, their initial threat broadly limited to a couple of hopeful sighters from long range from Burak Yilmaz. As the half wore on, though, there was a sense of Chelsea’s caution inviting trouble. There were a couple of nice flicks from Havertz, a zigzagging run through the middle from Kovacic, but there was little flow. Havertz and Pulisic were isolated, with Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso under instructions not to push forward on the flanks, and Chelsea would run into difficulties after they lost Andreas Christensen, the loss of the Danish centre-back briefly causing them to lose composure at the back. Trevoh Chalobah was the player sent on in Christensen’s place and within a minute of coming on the young defender was being turned by Jonathan David. Players wriggling beyond Chalobah seems to be a weakness in his game – he was fortunate not to concede a penalty for something similar against Newcastle – and Chelsea were under pressure when he conceded a free-kick after dragging David down. The free-kick came in, the ball was not cleared and Lille screamed for a penalty when Jorginho handled as he tried to challenge Xeka. It was a blatant handball and although Davide Massa missed it in real time, there was no doubt that the Italian referee would point to the spot after being told to check the pitchside monitor, allowing Yilmaz to give Lille hope by burying a ruthless spot-kick beyond Édouard Mendy. With the home fans bouncing, it seemed that Chelsea were on the ropes. That, though, was the cue for them to show their class. Just before half-time they equalised in splendid fashion, Jorginho relishing the chance to make up for his part in Lille’s goal. The pass from the Italian was beautiful, bent with the outside of his right foot, Lille’s defence cut to shreds, and there was Pulisic running in unnoticed from the right before clipping a low shot across Léo Jardim and into the far corner. It was a vital intervention from Pulisic, a player in decent goalscoring form of late, though Tuchel was not entirely satisfied. Chelsea were still only playing in bursts and Tuchel used the interval to tweak his formation, the introduction of Mason Mount for Kovacic intended to give Lille more to worry about at the back. Yet it was Lille who carried the greater threat at the start of the second half. They almost led again when Jonathan Bamba, twisting past Alonso on the right, crossed for Yilmaz to head inches wide with Mendy beaten. There were still too many gaps in Chelsea’s defence, even with Thiago Silva at the heart of it, and they had another escape just after the hour, Xeka’s free header bouncing off the woodwork and to safety. Lille, sixth in Ligue 1, would regret those misses. With 19 minutes left the tie was out of reach, Mount darting down the left and swung a dangerous cross to the far post. Timothy Weah was not quick enough off the mark and Azpilicueta charged, kneeing the ball past Jardim to give Chelsea a fleeting sense of control over their own destiny.",Sport/Football,Pulisic and Azpilicueta help Chelsea fend off Lille despite turbulent future,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/16/lille-chelsea-champions-league-match-report
3/17/2022,"Charlie Ewels has been banned for three weeks after his red card against Ireland, but his suspension could be cut to two weeks if he completes a tackling technique course. A disciplinary panel determined that the incident in which Ewels made head-on-head contact with James Ryan – after only 82 seconds of England’s 32-15 defeat at Twickenham on Saturday – was “reckless as a result of the player’s poor tackle technique” and though the entry point for the tackle was six weeks, it was reduced by 50% for mitigating factors such as admitting guilt and showing remorse. England have this week been collectively working on their tackle technique, seeking to go low against France to avoid another red-card scenario in Paris on Saturday. Provided Ewels follows suit and takes part in a “coaching intervention programme”, he is set to miss only the France match and Bath’s Premiership match against Sale on 26 March. In Ewels’ absence, Joe Launchbury is the favourite to start in the second-row alongside Maro Itoje in Paris, having come off the bench for his first appearance in 15 months against Ireland. Jones will announce his team on Thursday evening following an afternoon training session designed to acclimatise to Saturday’s late kick-off as well as prepare for next year’s World Cup, with England having arrived in Paris on Tuesday. With Tom Curry sidelined, the door is open for Sam Underhill to make his first appearance of this year’s championship at openside flanker. Jones will also make changes to his back line, having dropped Max Malins amid England’s misfiring attack. George Furbank and Elliot Daly are among the options to come in. France will wrap up the grand slam and a first title since 2010 with victory but Jamie George believes that comes with its own pressures for Saturday’s hosts. George made his debut in Paris in 2015 and believes silencing the Stade de France crowd will be key. “There’s a huge amount of pressure on it for those guys,” he said. “The thing we’ve learned is to not get too distracted in the week with reading this and that and expecting this and that to happen. In terms of our psyche, we want to give them something that they’re not going to expect, we want to go there and spoil the party a little bit. “We’ve got different tactics and ideas about that but fundamentally what we want to focus on is putting an 80-minute performance together that we are proud of because in parts we’ve been brilliant in this Six Nations but also there have been parts that have not been good enough.” “We want to try and silence that crowd pretty early on,” George added. “We’re aware of how to do that. Physically, not giving them the things they want, and that might put more pressure on to the French team if the crowd isn’t getting behind them. It might start becoming a little bit more difficult for them and they might start second-guessing themselves a little bit. That will all be part of the plan.” Meanwhile, Sky Sports has announced a four-year deal with Sanzaar to broadcast southern hemisphere rugby union, including England’s three-Test tour of Australia this summer. The deal until 2025 includes rights to home nations summer tours, the Rugby Championship, Super Rugby, The Currie Cup and The National Provincial Championship. As well as showing England in Australia this summer, Sky Sports will televise Ireland’s three-Test tour of New Zealand, Wales’s three-Test tour of South Africa and Scotland’s three-Test tour of Argentina.",Sport/Sport,England’s Charlie Ewels can take course to reduce ban for ‘reckless’ tackle,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/16/englands-charlie-ewels-can-take-course-to-reduce-ban-for-reckless-tackle
3/17/2022,"For how much longer he will remain one of their own who knows. Harry Kane himself may not have the answer; much rests on the next ten games and Tottenham’s final place in the Premier League standings. But for so long as he remains in situ, the goals will come, and the fans will serenade him. Kane’s side were already one to the good when Wayne Rooney’s away goalscoring record was broken, Cristian Romero having unwittingly grabbed his first since joining before the break. As they do, Brighton started the second half brightly. As Kane does, he made the finish look easy, having been fed Rodrigo Bentancur on the counter. He has 95th league goals on the road and the Champions League dream rolls on. Once more Tottenham jolt forward, learner drivers yet to master the pedal. They have a fine instructor but pulling away smoothly remains a work in progress. Lose; win; repeat. That must stop. Aesthetically pleasing as their symmetrical start to 2022 has been - eight wins and eight defeats - consistent inconsistence is a trait Antonio Conte will deplore. A dirty half dozen of consecutive defeats for Graham Potter’s Brighton means their season has petered out. Owner Tony Bloom spent the afternoon watching his horse Energumene triumph in the Queen Mother Champion Chase at the Cheltenham Festival, before being chauffeured the near 150 miles back to the Amex. A quick return journey may have been on the cards. There will be no amateur over-dramatics from Brighton supporters. They appreciate how far they have come in a short space of time. Yet football fans crave entertainment, and the large handful of empty blue seats around the Amex had multiplied rapidly well before the close. There are, after all, cheaper ways to be entertained than 10 goals in 15 home league games. The first half lacked zip, perhaps unsurprising for Tottenham given they were unchanged from weekend disappointment at Old Trafford. Conte had suggested this would be the case as their Manchester showing largely pleased him. It will have caused pain too; double-game weeks are not the Italian’s ‘thing’. There was almost some relief in a gift-wrapped perfect start though. Lewis Dunk’s back-pass was innocuous, if slightly underweight, but the fault lay with Robert Sánchez. The goalkeeper was way too casual in allowing Kane to successfully charge down the clearance. For the second time in five days here, Sánchez’s heart was in his mouth; Kane rolled a left-footed shot across the face of goal. And so, it was left to Brighton to draw first blood a minute later - literally. Neil Maupay caught Eric Dier in the air to earn a booking. Nothing vicious but Dier continued a-la Terry Butcher. Tottenham’s opener had more than a touch of fortune. Dejan Kulusevski, who has quietly excelled since his January arrival, shot from the edge of the box. It hit Romero loitering in the area and spun away from Sánchez. Conte swivelled in the visiting dug out, drew hands from pockets for the first time and punched the air. It was tough on Brighton who had until then - sloppiness excluded - looked marginally superior. Leandro Trossard was troublesome in dangerous areas; Yves Bissouma delicately broke up play. Kane was tad fortuitous to escape a booking after reacting to losing possession with a bear hug. Their problem has been that bubble-wrapped scissors have more cutting edge than their frontline in recent weeks. It was Tottenham’s Bentancur who came closest to beating Hugo Lloris with an attempted clearance from 30-yards directed goalward. It floated just over. Tottenham were almost handed a second with an error going unpunished pre-break. Shane Duffy - one of two changes from Saturday’s defeat to Liverpool - attempted to clear by heading straight into Kulusevski’s chest. This time Sánchez came to the rescue. A Kane free-kick on the stroke of the interval was harmless. As with the first goal, the second came with the hosts on top. Attack quickly became defence as possession was lost, Kane delighting the travelling fans, kicking a fizzy drinks bottle in celebration. He would twice almost turn provider, sending Sergio Reguilón racing away only for Sánchez to pull off a pair of fine saves. Brighton huffed and puffed but they came not much closer than a Marc Cucurella drive that went wide. No shots on target, one goal in six. Tottenham’s faint hopes of top-four continue to flicker. Their issue has been that against the five sides immediately above them, their haul is a pitiful three from a possible 24 points. Starting with West Ham’s visit to Haringey on Sunday, that needs addressing.",Sport/Football,Cristian Romero and Harry Kane on target as Spurs ease past Brighton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/16/brighton-tottenham-premier-league-match-report
3/17/2022,"When Tony Sewell released the report by the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities last March, it was met by an avalanche of criticism. Wednesday’s reaction from ministers, following a year of delay, artfully ignores its most damaging and ridiculed conclusions. Academics pulled apart Sewell’s claims that teaching about the UK’s colonial past should include material that “speaks to the slave period not only being about profit and suffering, but how culturally African people transformed themselves into a remodelled African/Britain”. David Olusoga, the author and professor of public history at the University of Manchester, said it was a similar argument to one used by slave owners 200 years ago: “The idea that by becoming culturally British, black people were somehow beneficiaries of the system.” Doreen Lawrence, who campaigned for justice for 18 years after the murder of her son Stephen by racists, warned that the Sewell report risked pushing the fight against racism “back 20 years or more” for undermining the existence of structural racism. Public health experts said the report was “divorced from the reality” of health disparities that black, Asian and minority ethnic communities faced and that were rooted in structural racism. Windrush campaigners condemned the report for paying so little attention to the scandal that was exposed by the Guardian four years ago. Wednesday’s briefing on the government’s Inclusive Britain strategy, which has been released as a response to the Sewell report, has been shorn of some of the references that provoked such scorn. There is no mention of slavery, let alone how it might be taught. Instead, the briefing speaks of “establishing a diverse panel of historians to develop a new knowledge-rich model history curriculum by 2024 to support high-quality teaching of our complex past”. There is no mention of who might sit on the panel or who will choose the historians. The Sewell report concluded that the “claim the country is still institutionally racist is not borne out by the evidence”. It also downplayed structural racism, the wider political and social disadvantages within society. Instead, the government’s response makes recommendations to increase scrutiny of the police at local levels and of “stop and search” tactics, which have been criticised for disproportionately targeting black youths, and introduce an automatic “opt-in” to help minority ethnic groups and others receive the legal advice they need when in police custody. It also suggests a white paper on tackling health disparities. There is no mention of some health claims in the Sewell report: for example, that high Covid death rates among some minority ethnic groups were mainly due to external factors such as a greater likelihood to live in deprivation or to do a public-facing job. Last year’s report concluded that racism is a “real force” but that Britain is no longer a country where the “system is deliberately rigged against ethnic minorities”. It also criticised the “accusatory tone of much of the current rhetoric on race, and the pessimism about what has been, and what more can be, achieved”. The briefing suggests help for BAME people in the workplace, including “a new in-work support offer to every jobcentre from April, with 37 new specialist “progression champions” to support working claimants. It also suggests closely working with industry to collect data on ethnicity of business owners applying for finance, a new HSBC scheme to support more ethnic minorities to become entrepreneurs, and “developing regulatory standards and guidance to address potential racial bias in AI”. And there is still no mention of Windrush.",News/World news,Government strategy sidesteps Sewell race report’s most criticised conclusions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/ministers-government-strategy-sewell-race-report
