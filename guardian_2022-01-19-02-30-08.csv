1/19/2022,"The fashion designer and businessman Nino Cerruti was first and last a native of the city of Biella in northern Italy, where alpine-pastured sheep, and mountain water and its millwheel powers, had been supplying an industry in fine wool textiles for a millennium. He was bred to the spinning and loom trades – “I was born in a manger,” he said, “only instead of straw, there was wool” – and he returned to those trades, and Biella, for his last years. In between, Cerruti, who has died aged 91, became an international fashion name, whose relaxed suits made star appearances in more than 100 Hollywood movies, by applying his profound knowledge of the properties of good wool and other natural fibres to a modern masculine tailoring that did not depend for shape on an invisible interior armature of canvas, padding and lining.  At 20, he had suddenly inherited the family mill in Biella, founded in 1881 by his grandfather Antonio (the Cerrutis had been in wool since the 18th century), and set about improving its machinery while respecting the woolly product, and used that as raw material for what developed into “deconstructed” garments, which are in fact very constructed, being subtly girdered by the cut and seaming of their parts. To see his soft tailoring in hard action, look at the Cerruti-jacketed shoulders and torsos of Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas in the 1980s television series Miami Vice, how the interplay of their muscles directly animates the fabric. The journalist Suzy Menkes wrote that in fashion BC means Before Cerruti, an antique era of suits like plate armour. Cerruti was the first of the Italian industrial family firm heads to put together in the 50s ancient craft techniques and new, quality, factory production – the beginning of “Made in Italy” ready-to-wear, now a fashion standard. He originally went into the Lanificio Fratelli Cerruti mill in Biella for a month during a long school holiday when he was 10, ordered there by his father, Silvio, and in their teens he and his two younger brothers watched as Silvio was put in charge locally of fairly distributing the limited postwar fibre supplies, and reviving production. Nino wanted to be a writer, but Silvio died in 1951, and, as eldest, he dropped out of his philosophy degree and took over, continuing his father’s innovations, particularly in lightweight fabrics. Cerruti realised his firm could be its own best customer if it made clothes from its cloth. At first he collaborated with tailors to show the cloth’s potential; to project a stylish image across Italy, he commissioned four short plays from famous writers, put on in Milan, Turin, Rome and far south in Naples, and designed the costumes himself. In 1957, he entered the ready-to-wear market that was supplementing, and would supplant, tailor-made menswear, with the launch of his first label, Hitman, in Milan, adding the “designer” Flying Cross brand in 1962. Cerruti recruited talented disciples who could work within his ever-more-easy manner, notably Giorgio Armani from 1964 to 1970, whom the world then credited with Cerruti’s advances in deconstruction and male textiles for female fashion. Cerruti opened a boutique on the Place de la Madeleine in Paris in 1967, afterwards showing men’s, then also women’s, collections during Paris fashion week, rather than in Milan; he later moved company headquarters to Paris, though textile and garment production stayed in Italy. Movie people had discovered Hitman and Flying Cross in the early 60s when Hollywood filmed in Rome’s Cinecittà Studios, or employed Italian crews to shoot epics in Spain. Male stars liked his casual clothes, which softened further in the 70s when he added jersey fabrics and knitwear. (A Cerruti knit endures: he wore a signature yellow sweater to his shows for more than 30 years, getting through just three, with slight style revisions.) What stars wore off-screen they requested for their on-screen wardrobes, including Richard Gere in Pretty Woman (1990), Harrison Ford in Clear and Present Danger (1994), Bruce Willis in Hudson Hawk (1991), Clint Eastwood in In the Line of Fire (1993), and Cerruti’s “muse” Kathleen Turner as private eye VI Warshawski (1991). A Cerruti suit’s drape could conceal any calibre of handgun with a few per cent of stretch Lycra added to the fibre mix. Because Cerruti commanded his Italian manufacturing base all the way to its primary imports of Australian wool and Mongolian cashmere, he was less dependent than most designers on couture catwalk publicity to promote perfume sales and other revenue-generators. The business diversified – jeans, some accessories, reshapings for markets in Asia – but unlike many French houses it was never absorbed into a luxury conglomerate company in exchange for promised infusions of capital. Not until 2000 did Cerruti decide that the company cashflow provided insufficient capital for growth, and then he took six months to audition a partner firm, selling 51% to the Italian industrial company Fin.part. It ended in tears within a year, after Fin.part, which had taken over full control, forced Cerruti, then aged 71, out for “irreconcilable differences”: Cerruti said there was “perpetual conflict”. Fin.part went bankrupt in 2005, the Cerruti name was sold on to successive owners, none faring well. Cerruti immediately returned to Biella to work at, and for, his mill and the city, to keep business and traditions viable despite extreme globalisation in textile production. He sold part of the mill shares in 2016 to the Brandamour company in the hope that their young entrepreneurs would assure its future. Cerruti had two children, Julian, who worked with him as an assistant in the fashion business, and Silvia, from a marriage that ended in divorce. He had been in a partnership with Sibylla Jahr since the 90s.

1/19/2022,"When Dr Prit Buttar, a retired GP, decided to break social distancing rules and offer his embrace to a bereaved woman, it was a gesture of core humanity. “Everybody on the team would have done exactly the same, Covid or no Covid,” he said from his study near Kirkcudbright. He did not envisage, a year on, that his recollection of that moment would inspire a cathartic outpouring of similar memories from people across the UK, or that he would become a reluctant – though passionate – advocate for the fury and dismay of ordinary people at the boozy rule-breaking in the seat of power.  “So much for coming up to Scotland for a quiet retirement,” he said. Last Friday, Buttar – “flabbergasted and angered and amazed” by the ongoing revelations of Downing Street parties – decided to share on Twitter his recollection of this particular patient who had lodged in his memory. Buttar, a military historian and former British Army surgeon, spent his working life near Oxford before retiring to Dumfries and Galloway in 2016 with his Scottish wife. He usually tweets about wars gone by or his elderly golden retriever, and had waited for a few days after drafting the tweets. “I was just really stunned by the response,” he said. Buttar offered the hug when he was volunteering at a vaccination centre last spring. In that thread, he describes how a woman in her late 60s had apologised profusely for missing her initial appointment two days earlier. She explained that her husband had died of cancer the previous week. Her only son lived in England and, because his wife had just been diagnosed with Covid, he had been unable to travel. The couple had moved to Scotland from England on the eve of the pandemic, and had had no opportunity to make local friends during lockdown. She had dealt with his death and funeral entirely alone. “So I decided to break the rules about social distancing. I leaned forward in my chair and put my arms around her. She clung to me and wept, and sobbed into my shoulder, ‘This is the first time anyone’s embraced me since he died.’” Let me tell you about the time that I broke Covid rules.During the second lockdown, I was working in the vaccination clinics. One afternoon, one of the staff on reception came through and asked if it was OK to book in a woman who had missed her appointment two days before. 1/8 Buttar’s thread has been read by tens of thousands of people and generated hundreds of similarly heart-wrenching examples of momentary rule-bending out of love or compassion: a nurse who admits suggesting to a family they remove their gloves to hold their dying mother’s hand; the son who raced over to his parents’ home after his father collapsed, only to be chastised by police; the stranger who offered a lift to an injured elderly man. As one respondent observed, none of them referred to after-work drinks because the weather was sunny. “There are so many people with tragic stories of their own and how they had done just the little gestures that make life a bit more bearable,” Butter said. “And then there are the many, many people who had not broken the rules. They had to say goodbye to loved ones through windows or across iPads. And now how angry they were, when they learned of how casually other people had disregarded the rules”. The thread was categorically not a criticism of lockdown, he added. “The intention was absolutely to highlight the difference between experiences of ordinary people and the conduct of those in leadership.” On the prime minister’s conduct, Buttar was definitive: “In my working life, had I shown errors of judgment that were remotely close to this the General Medical Council would have taken away my licence to practise.” The anticipated Gray inquiry was simply “an attempt to kick the can down the road”, he said. “What we already know is sufficiently damning … just from the prime minister’s statement, the level of poor judgment that was shown is already bad enough to require resignation.” Buttar, who served on the GP’s committee of the British Medical Association, also raised the impact of the Downing Street revelations on colleagues still working on the frontline, particularly in intensive care. “Many old friends are either close to the edge, or actually far beyond the edge. For them to see these emails in Whitehall of ‘We’ve had a jolly hard week, so let’s go for a party in the garden’ … can you imagine as to people’s morale?” Comments were still being left under the thread, he said. “There is a huge need for people to tell their stories and to open up about what these brutal days meant to them.”",News/World news,‘I put my arms around her’: doctor’s story captures anger at No 10 parties,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/i-put-my-arms-around-her-doctors-story-captures-anger-at-no-10-parties
1/19/2022,"A replica of the entrance gate to the Dachau Nazi concentration camp is to be recreated over three days in Leeds for an art project asking questions about what memorials are for and who has the right to make them. Dachau was constructed a few miles from Munich in 1933. During the war it became a death camp where more than 41,000 people were murdered before US troops liberated it on 29 April 1945.  Its iron gate bearing the words “Arbeit macht frei” (work will set you free) was stolen in 2014, which led to a local blacksmith making an exact replica. The artist Rachel Mars, who has learned to weld, will be making a replica of that replica when she arrives in Leeds in March. Visitors to the project will enter a big empty warehouse space and be given a welding helmet to watch Mars construct the gate as accurately as she can. Mars’ grandparents arrived in Britain in August 1939 on one of the last Kindertransport trains from Germany. She grew up hearing stories from her grandmother. “I’ve been thinking about sites where traumatic historical things happen for a long time … perhaps ever,” she said. As a Jew, she said, there was always the decision on whether to visit Holocaust history sites. “Are you going to do the Auschwitz tour? I’ve decided not to because I sort of feel it’s at my dinner table and breakfast table so I don’t need to go, but it’s an ongoing question.” A number of things set Mars off on the Dachau gate project, including David Cameron’s announcement of a UK Holocaust memorial in 2016, at the same time his government was embroiled in a controversy about allowing child refugees into the country. “I do have questions about a nationally commissioned memorial,” said Mars. “What that means for a country to take on the narrative and shape it themselves? “I think there is a spin that the UK does on its Holocaust past, that it is only the good guy. In some ways they are the good guy – my grandparents ended up here. But the reasons we have the Kindertransport is because they weren’t allowing the adults in. “I have questions about how much this memorial will take responsibility for the UK’s ongoing fuck-up with regards to letting immigrants in.” Mars said the theft of the gate, which turned up in Bergen, Norway two years later, raised questions about the market that exists for Holocaust memorabilia. “How much memory is trapped in these kind of objects?” All of these questions will be addressed in Mars’ performance piece, titled Forge, taking place in a new experimental space in Leeds called Testbed, described as 10,000 sq ft (930 sq metres) of “blank canvas” for artists. Learning to weld had been a pleasurable experience, she said. “Welding is quite meditative. It is really peaceful. The thing it’s most similar to what I’ve done before is archery. It takes a lot of preparation for tiny moments of work. It’s incredibly focused, you can’t think about anything else.” Mars said it was easy to weld badly, which increased the pressure on her. “I want to do it as well as I can but I’m not a professional so I expect it will be slightly wonky and that is interesting to me. It can only be as good as I can do it.” Forge has been commissioned as part of the Leeds international performance festival, Transform. Once the gate is made, Mars plans to grind down the weld and make the component parts into a gate at future performances. “For me that says something about the act of repeating memory.” Further down the line she hopes to melt it down and make the gate into something useful. “That’s the horizon plan,” she said. “Potentially spoons.”  Forge, part of Leeds’s Transform festival, takes place 31 March-2 April.",Arts/Art and design,Artist to weld copy of Dachau gate in Leeds performance piece,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/18/artist-to-weld-copy-of-dachau-gate-in-leeds-performance-piece
1/19/2022,"Chocoholics went nuts for nuts this Christmas and avoided novelty chocolates, according to the boss of Hotel Chocolat. Hazelnuts, pistachios, peanut butter and pecan-based chocolates were hugely popular over the festive period. Shoppers also traded up to bigger boxes of chocolates as they were able to get together with family.  In contrast, novelty chocolates such as gingerbread men and Santas were less popular. A quarter of Hotel Chocolat’s range now includes nuts. Boss Angus Thirlwell said: “It was a slightly unusual phenomena but nuts had their day in the sun. I think it was a combination of being seen as healthy but also authentic.” He said shoppers were looking for “real ingredients” and trying to buy foods that would have less impact on the planet. The company has responded to demand with recipes such as maple and pecan drinking chocolate, a raspberry- and pecan-filled chocolate and a vegan creamy-tasting chocolate made with hazelnuts. Hazelnut is the bestselling nutty addition to chocolates in the UK, while in Japan it is pistachio. Hotel Chocolat’s sales surged 37% in the three months to 26 December and 63% on pre-pandemic levels. Thirlwell said families had decided to “go for it” in celebrating, leading to a surge in ordering online gifts and treats for large gatherings. The company saw strong growth in the US and Japan as well as the UK. Its Velvetiser hot chocolate machine, alongside linked products, was a “star performer”, encouraging shoppers to take out subscription services for supplies. Thirlwell said Hotel Chocolat had been forced to put up prices on some chocolate products by several per cent before Christmas but believed the company would not have to increase them again this year. He said cost rises on ingredients, shipping and wages could be offset by efficiencies generated by the group’s leap in sales.",News/Business,"Christmas shoppers cracked out the nuts, says Hotel Chocolat",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/18/christmas-shoppers-cracked-out-the-nuts-says-hotel-chocolat

According to “Weird Al” Yankovic, a forthcoming biopic starring Radcliffe as the cult hero behind comical spoof versions of classic songs will alter the course of the actor’s career. Radcliffe was confirmed to star in Weird: The Al Yankovic Story on Tuesday. The film will follow the life and career of the five-time Grammy award-winning musician, whose early hits included Eat It (a parody of Michael Jackson’s Beat It), Amish Paradise (Coolio’s Gangsta’s Paradise) and Like a Surgeon (Madonna’s Like a Virgin).  “When my last movie UHF came out in 1989, I made a solemn vow to my fans that I would release a major motion picture every 33 years, like clockwork,” the 62-year-old said. “I’m very happy to say we’re on schedule. “And I am absolutely thrilled that Daniel Radcliffe will be portraying me in the film. I have no doubt whatsoever that this is the role future generations will remember him for.” The biopic will air on streaming service Roku. It is written by Yankovic and Eric Appel, and produced by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay’s company, Funny Or Die. Production is scheduled to begin in Los Angeles in early February. “When Weird Al first sat me down against my will and told me his life story, I didn’t believe any of it, but I knew that we had to make a movie about it,” Appel said. Yankovic, who has recorded more than 150 parodies and original songs, is the biggest-selling comedy recording artist of all time. His 2014 release Mandatory Fun was the first comedy album in history to debut at number one on US music chart Billboard’s Top 200. “There clearly aren’t enough biopic movies about famous musicians and we were excited to shine a light on the incredibly true, unexaggerated story of Weird Al,” said Colin Davis, Roku’s head of original scripted programming. Radcliffe, 32, recently took part in HBO’s Harry Potter reunion, Return to Hogwarts, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the film franchise. His other recent projects included TV series Miracle Workers and Australian prison film Escape from Pretoria.

1/19/2022,"For centuries the citizens of Wales have proudly marked St David’s Day with parades, concerts, flag-waving and the wearing of daffodils. But this year the feast of their patron saint will be celebrated with particular gusto by many, after Gwynedd council bosses defied ministers in London and voted to give up to 5,000 of its workers an extra day off. While Scotland and Northern Ireland designate a bank holiday to celebrating their patron saint, Wales does not, which has long been a source of discontent.  On Tuesday, the council cabinet of Gwynedd, in the north-west of Wales, voted to shut its buildings and wind down its services on 1 March to give as many people as possible the day off. Cabinet members were scathing of the refusal by the UK government’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, which has responsibility for bank holidays in Wales as well as England, to back the plans on the grounds a day off would disrupt business. Councillors accused Westminster of treating Welsh people as children, or as the empire’s last colony, and said they were fed up with going “like Oliver Twist” to London to ask for concessions. They complained it was not fair that an extra bank holiday had been granted to mark the Queen’s platinum jubilee but was not allowed to celebrate their patron saint. The leader of the Plaid Cymru-controlled council, Dyfrig Siencyn, said it was “drawing a line in the sand” and hoped other councils would follow its example. “It’s really offensive and insulting; our masters in London are treating us as little children who cannot make decisions themselves,” he said. “I think it’s another example of how this government is treating us here in Wales. What do we expect from such a government that sees us as the last colony the empire has?” Another councillor, Nia Jeffreys, said: “The principle behind it is the importance of St David’s Day for us as a nation, how close it is to our hearts. It’s embarrassing that they can give an extra day off willy nilly for the Queen’s jubilee but we can’t decide for ourselves what day we have off.” Teachers will not get the holiday because their conditions are negotiated centrally. But staff such as social workers, refuse collectors, librarians, cleaners will have a paid holiday, costing the council about £200,000. Dilwyn Morgan, a councillor, said: “Let us decide what we want to do with St David’s Day. The days of going to a foreign government like Oliver Twist with our empty bowl asking: ‘Please can we have more?’ – those days need to come to an end very soon.” For councillor Craig ab Iago, the issue was a metaphor for Wales’s relationship with London. “This matter is important to use as nation,” he said. “It’s a clear part of our culture, history and identity and we want to celebrate it.” He said London’s attitude was: “Go back to your cage boys and shut up”, adding: We deserve better than this; our history is as important as theirs.” A Welsh government spokesperson said: “We’ve repeatedly asked the UK government for the Senedd to have the powers to make St David’s Day a bank holiday, and it’s disappointing to see these requests continue to be refused.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘Not a colony’: Welsh council defies London to declare St David’s Day holiday ,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/18/not-a-colony-welsh-council-defies-london-to-declare-st-davids-day-holiday
1/19/2022,"A Nazi-era law banning doctors from giving women information about abortions is to be scrapped by Germany’s new government in a decision welcomed by activists who have long argued that it has hampered women’s ability to make informed choices. The justice minister Marco Buschmann said that he will ditch Paragraph 219a from the penal code after almost 90 years, meaning that doctors will no longer have to fear prosecution if they provide information about the procedure.  The law forbids “advertising for pregnancy termination” and in recent years has led to a concerted campaign by right-wing groups against doctors who post factual details relating to the procedure on their websites. The most high profile case involved Kristina Hänel, a GP who lost an appeal against a €6000 penalty she received in 2017 for offering abortion advice to her patients. On Tuesday she welcomed the announcement saying she was “joyful and grateful” that the law had been scrapped, adding that it “hung like Damocles sword” over doctors who lived in fear of prosecution even by just discussing options with their patients. Buschmann of the pro-business FDP, said it made no sense that information about abortion was available freely on the internet, “but that precisely those people who are qualified in this regard, are not allowed to provide the information”. He sought to appease anti-abortion groups who have argued that the abolition of Paragraph 219a will encourage more terminations. Doctors, he said, would be restricted to giving factual information. “The situation for the affected woman is difficult enough,” Buschmann said. “We don’t want to make it even more difficult.” The law change was included in the coalition contract between the Social Democrats, Greens and the FDPwhich states: “the option to terminate a pregnancy at no cost is part of a reliable health care system”. Abortions are technically illegal in Germany, but they are allowed under certain circumstances and must be carried out within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The woman is also required to receive counselling and the doctor must check that this has been carried out. An abortion is not considered a punishable offence if the pregnant woman’s life is in danger or the pregnancy might lead to severe physical or psychological impairment. Hospitals run or supported by the Catholic church do not offer abortions. Buschmann said that a commission would be set up to consider other aspects of reproductive medicine which could be improved, including better support for couples who were having difficulties get pregnant. Among the opponents of the law change is the opposition conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Its MP, Elisabeth Winkelmeier-Becker disputed the argument that women faced a barrier when it came to receiving proper information about termination procedures and who provides them. “We’re talking about the mother’s right to self-determination, as well as about the life of the unborn child,” she told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Paragraph 219a was enacted in May 1933, at the start of the Nazi dictatorship, when it was introduced in order to “protect the German nation”. The regime equated abortion with treason. But the campaign to have it repealed did not start properly until after German reunification in 1990.",News/World news,Germany’s new government to scrap Nazi-era abortion law,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/germanys-new-government-to-scrap-nazi-era-abortion-law
1/19/2022,"The rightwing Fox News host Laura Ingraham has stoked outrage by announcing that the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff had tested positive for Covid-19 – and applauding as she did so.  One critic called the host a “merchant of death”. Another said he was “not sure when hate became a Christian value”. Gen Mark Milley became a target of rightwing anger after extensive reporting showed how he worked to contain Donald Trump at the end of his time in power, keeping US armed forces out of domestic affairs. Milley has also defended the teaching in military institutions of critical race theory, an academic discipline which conservatives have turned into a profitable election issue. On Monday, Ingraham introduced a section of her show called Positively Boosted, in which she gleefully recounts which vaccinated public figures have tested positive. Clapping and smiling, she said: “Triple-vaxxed joint chiefs chairman Mark Milley, our favorite Mark Milley, tested positive for Covid yesterday. “And who else? Gen David Berger, the Marine Corps commandant, also positively boosted.” Earlier, a spokesman for Milley said the general was “experiencing very minor symptoms and can perform all of his duties from the remote location. He has received the Covid-19 vaccines including the booster”. A spokeswoman for Berger said: “The performance of his duties will remain unaffected.” More than 850,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US, the vast majority unvaccinated. Federal authorities have repeatedly said that breakthrough infections are possible, particularly from the Omicron virus variant. Nonetheless, like other public health measures, the Biden administration’s armed forces vaccine mandate has become a target of conservative anger. On air on Monday, after a brief discussion of reports of a senior Vatican official also testing positive, Ingraham said: “We certainly hope they’re all healthy and fine. But stop pushing your mandates.” Amid widespread criticism, Kim Masters, an editor-at-large for the Hollywood Reporter, said Ingraham was “absolutely disgusting and so are [Fox Corporation chairman and chief executive] Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch for giving her a platform”. “These monsters are merchants of death,” Masters wrote. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor-at-large of America Magazine, said: “Laura Ingraham is often described as someone in favor of ‘Christian values’. “But the last time I checked, we’re supposed to love our enemies, not celebrate when they get sick. Jesus had compassion for the sick; he didn’t laugh at them. Not sure when hate become a Christian value.” Others pointed to Fox News’ own strict vaccination requirements for staff. Ingraham also made news on Tuesday with an interview with Northern Virginia magazine in which she said she was not yet ready to back Trump for president again.

1/19/2022,"“Please, someone, explain,” pleads Adrian Chiles at the end of his article on how local democracy works (I believe in local democracy – I just don’t understand it, 13 January). On the basis of two years’ experience as a local parish councillor, I can tell him that in the case of parish councils, “it doesn’t”. In those two years, at the end of which I resigned in utter frustration, I learned that our parish council has virtually no powers or decision-making authority with respect to anything of significant importance.  Almost all matters of significance are the responsibility, and within the jurisdiction, of someone else: planning and housing (borough council and central government); roads and road safety, including local speed limits (county council and central government); education/schools (education authority and central government); health and social care (health trust, county council and central government); crime, policing and public safety (police and crime commissioner, and the home secretary); bus service (county council, bus service providers and central government); flooding (county council). In its election manifesto in 2019, the Conservative party wrote: “Our new Towns Fund will help communities make sure their towns are safe to walk in and a pleasure to be in … Above all, we want the town’s future to be in the hands of the people who live there.” The reality, however, is that during its first two years in office, the central government has sought to increase its control over decision-making, at the expense of the authority of local government, in almost all of the areas of governance that I have listed above.Philip C StenningEccleshall, Staffordshire  Like Adrian Chiles, I too believe in local democracy, but find it baffling – and I have the advantage that for the past nine years I have either been the parish clerk or a parish councillor. The division of responsibility between town and parish councils, the local authority (usually a county council outside large cities) and central government is confusing and illogical, with too many decisions being made in London that would be far better made locally. In general, your local parish or town council usually has a good idea of who does what. So if you have a problem but are baffled by local democracy, I suggest you contact a local councillor, who should be able to point you in the right direction.Alan JordanVice-chair, Middridge parish council, County Durham  In the 1980s, and before the national curriculum, things were very different in some secondary schools. As parish, district, county, parliamentary and EU elections heaved into view, my social studies department concentrated on the structures, constituencies and policies according to the printed manifestos of the political parties. Students lapped it up, particularly the opportunity to write their own manifestos for a particular election. Many young people today are bamboozled by the structures or why it should matter to them.

1/19/2022,"Goldman Sachs paid its 43,900 bankers more than $17bn (£12.5bn) last year, a 33% increase on 2020 as the investment bank celebrated a more than doubling of pre-tax profits to $27bn thanks to frenzied dealmaking on both sides of the Atlantic. The pay and bonuses hike works out at about $403,000 for each employee on average, up from about $328,000 a year ago. It is the most the bank has paid out in wages and bonuses since 2007 at the height of the banking boom leading up to the financial crisis.  Goldman’s bankers will find out exactly how much they will personally collect for 2021 on Wednesday when the firm reveals annual bonuses on so-called “comp day”. About 400 leading bosses – or the top 1% of the firm – are expected to receive a special one-off pandemic bonus in recognition of the bank’s success during the coronavirus crisis. The bonuses for this elite group are expected to range from the low single digit million to tens of millions of dollars, according to Bloomberg sources. Goldman declined to comment. David Solomon, Goldman’s chief executive, is likely to see his pay rocket compared with last year when his compensation was cut by $10m over the bank’s role in the 1MDB scandal. He collected total pay of $17.5m in 2020, compared with $27.5m in 2019. Banks on both sides of the Atlantic have been rapidly raising pay and bonuses in recent months in a tussle for top talent as corporate deal-making continues to boom. Last summer Goldman increased pay for its junior bankers after they complained about “inhumane” working conditions and 100-hour weeks. The pay of first-year analysts, who previously received close to $70,000 in base pay, increased to $110,000 before bonuses. Second-year analysts saw their pay rise to $125,000.

1/19/2022,"Jonathan Freedland (It’s a scandal that Boris Johnson ever got to No 10 – and shaming that he’s still there, 14 January) is right, but in common with most other commentators, he omits the unpalatable truth that this country is likely to become (if it hasn’t already) a laughing stock in foreign capitals. To think that we have put in place a leader who is so utterly shameless and so devoid of any idea of what constitutes the truth will not be missed by leaders in Paris, Washington, Brussels or indeed Moscow and Beijing. How can such a person be trusted to negotiate sensibly or in a trustworthy manner on matters of international importance, when his main interest is his own political survival? And how can a nation that longs to be taken seriously on the international stage put up for a moment longer with this Pythonesque circus?

1/19/2022,"Restrictions brought in before Christmas to stem the Omicron surge across Scotland are to be lifted from next Monday, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said. Nightclubs will reopen, there will be an end to social distancing and to a three-household limit indoors, Sturgeon said, adding that the country had “turned the corner on the Omicron wave”.  But Sturgeon urged the public to remain “cautious” about socialising in larger groups, while government guidance remains to work from home wherever possible and use face coverings, with vaccine passports still in place for large-scale events. Sturgeon said in her regular statement at Holyrood that the data suggested Omicron peaked in Scotland in the first week of January and that “we are now on the downward slope of this wave of cases” as hospital and intensive care admissions were falling. Cases were down from 36,526 new cases on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday of last week to 20,268 cases reported this Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. She said that, after discussion with her cabinet, the remaining statutory measures introduced in response to Omicron – limits on indoor public events; the requirement for one-metre physical distancing between different groups in indoor public places; the requirement for table service in hospitality premises serving alcohol on the premises; and the closure of nightclubs – would be lifted from next Monday, 24 January. From that day, the guidance asking people to stick to a three-household limit on indoor gatherings will also be lifted. Before the statement, opposition parties and business groups called on Sturgeon to ease restrictions quickly. The Scottish Hospitality Group pointed to Scottish government research which suggested that the number of people visiting bars and restaurants has fallen while the number mixing in each other’s homes has risen. The Scottish Conservative MSP Dr Sandesh Gulhane, the shadow cabinet secretary for health, said the statement marked “a sea change in the government’s policy, starting to shift from a rules-based approach more towards trusting the Scottish public”, but argued that the controversial vaccine passport scheme should also be scrapped. Sturgeon said the cabinet’s decision on vaccine passports was “finely balanced”, but that if case numbers were to rise again then extending the scheme to all hospitality venues “may well be a more proportionate alternative to other, more restrictive measures”. The Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, said that, despite the optimism contained in the statement, “too many businesses are still teetering on the brink” and called for a clearer framework of support: “We need a system that sets clear trigger points on what people can expect when cases rise – which lays out what support people will be entitled to and when.”",News/World news,Nicola Sturgeon announces lifting of Omicron restrictions in Scotland,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/nicola-sturgeon-announces-lifting-of-omicron-restrictions-in-scotland

1/19/2022,"A cult-like evangelical Christian society at a leading private school allowed a powerful and charismatic barrister to groom and sadistically abuse boys with impunity, an investigation has found. Members of the Christian Forum at Winchester college “showed signs of what would today be described as radicalisation”, said a 197-page review commissioned by the elite school into abuse carried out by John Smyth QC.  The school’s then headteacher, John Thorn, was informed of the abuse in 1982 but did not report it to police. Smyth moved to Zimbabwe, where he abused “as many as 90 boys, possibly resulting in the death of one”, the report said. Winchester college apologised “unreservedly” for its part in the “terrible experiences” of Smyth’s victims. In a statement, it said: “The review … demonstrates in particular that John Smyth was able to infiltrate the college’s Christian community and gain access to the college’s pupils, providing him with the opportunity to groom and then abuse them.” The review, published on Tuesday, said that Smyth had “unfettered access” to the college. “Multiple staff members, including the headmaster, were aware that Smyth was in close contact with boys in the Christian Forum and that he had a powerful influence over them”. However, “levels of supervision … were not sufficient to prevent or detect the physical or sexual abuse which Smyth perpetrated against pupils.” Pupils felt unable to disclose the abuse to staff, and staff members who had suspicions about Smyth’s activities did not share them with each other or report them upwards. Thorn, who is in his 90s, was unable to answer questions for the review. Smyth died in 2018. Up to 100 pupils attended the college’s weekly Christian Forum, which was dominated by Smyth. “The inner circle of the Christian Forum which formed around Smyth in the 1970s and early 1980s shares many features of a cult. Its members showed signs of what would today be described as radicalisation,” the review concluded. Boys were invited to Smyth’s home for Sunday lunch with his wife and three children, and some were subjected to brutal beatings in Smyth’s garden shed. One survivor said he received more than 1,000 strokes on one occasion. Two survivors later attempted suicide. In 2017, Andrew Watson, a former Winchester college pupil who is now the bishop of Guildford, said he had been subjected to a “violent, excruciating and shocking” beating by Smyth in his garden shed. One survivor told the reviewers that Smyth “made me feel special, part of an inner circle”. The QC imposed a “code of loyalty and secrecy”, the report said. Smyth also invited some Winchester boys to attend Christian summer camps, run by the Iwerne Trust, that were aimed at moulding the next generation of Christian leaders in public life. Smyth groomed boys at the camps for abuse in his shed. Some parents of Smyth’s victims raised concerns about his apparent hold over their children with Winchester college staff. Euan MacAlpine, a former housemaster, told an internal investigation in 2017: “We all suspected but never got together to discuss it.” In 1979, he told one parent: “The whole thing really is most awkward since none of us housemasters can tackle Smyth directly.” Thorn became aware of the abuse in September 1982, the report said. He wrote to one father: “It’s literally unbelievable. Because it was unbelievable, it was something none of us guessed at.” In October 1982, Thorn and two parents visited Smyth to get him to sign an undertaking to cut all ties with the school and seek psychiatric help. Thorn wrote: “We have I feel rendered him pretty well harmless.” At no stage were the police or any other statutory body informed of Smyth’s abuse. The report said: “As a result of [Thorn’s] inability to participate in the review, the reviewers have not been able to determine the reasons why no report was made.” The reviewers said they were aware of 13 former Winchester college pupils who were abused by Smyth, but it was “likely there were other victims”. The Church of England has also commissioned a review of its handling of allegations made against Smyth, which is due to report this year. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, who worked at the Iwerne Trust camps in the 1970s, apologised to survivors last year. In a statement, two survivors welcomed the report, saying the college had taken a “brave step … to establish the truth of what happened 40 years ago”. They commended the college’s “honesty and integrity”.  In the UK, the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac) offers support for adult survivors on 0808 801 0331.

1/19/2022,"The Spanish footballer Paco Gento, who has died aged 88, played in all five of Real Madrid’s successive victories in the European Cup between 1956 and 1960, and captained the Real team that won that cup for a sixth time in 1966, giving him more wins in Europe’s biggest competition than any other player. One of the greatest Spanish footballers, he never missed a European Cup match between 1955 and 1970, making 80 appearances altogether. In all he took part in eight European Cup finals, won 12 Spanish championship winner’s medals, and was capped 43 times for Spain between 1955 and 1969, appearing in the 1962 and 1966 World Cup finals.  Alfredo Di Stéfano, the grand panjandrum of Real Madrid, could find Gento blindfold: with an orthodox pass to the left-wing, or even a backheel. Then away would go the short, sturdy figure of Gento, an outside-left with remarkable pace, to finish with a shot or a centre. Di Stefano was his foil, but it was Real’s Argentinian inside-left of the early 1950s, Héctor Rial, who taught Gento how to use his frightening speed, which had earned him the nickname La Galerna del Cantábrico – the Gale of the Cantabrian Sea. Born in the village of Guarnizo in the Cantabria region of north-west Spain, Gento was playing for the nearest major club, Real Santander, at the age of 19, but had time to appear in only 10 league games before Real Madrid snapped him up in 1953. By 1955 he had gained his first Spain cap in a 1-1 draw against England in Madrid, and in the following year he was appearing in his debut European Cup final, against Reims in Paris. He set up the winning goal for Rial, 11 minutes from the end of a pulsating, fluctuating game that Madrid won 4-3. In the 1957 European Cup final at Real Madrid’s home ground, the Bernabéu, he scored Real’s second goal in a 2-0 success against Fiorentina, and another vital Gento goal was to come in the final of 1958, against Milan in Brussels, when in extra time he got the winner after 107 minutes, shooting through a group of players and past the unsighted goalkeeper, Narciso Soldan, to make it 3-2 to Madrid. Further European Cup winner’s medals, although no goals, followed in the finals of 1959 and 1960, against Reims and Eintracht Frankfurt. As Real’s tight hold on the cup was loosened, there were then losing appearances in finals in 1962 and 1964 before Gento skippered his side to a 2-1 win in 1966 against Partizan Belgrade in Brussels, providing him with his record haul of six victories in the competition. His team failed to appear in a European Cup final for the rest of his career, which lasted until 1971, but he did feature in the 1971 European Cup Winners’ Cup final, for victors of domestic competitions, which Madrid lost 2-1 in a replay to Chelsea. Gento’s trophy cabinet also contained a dozen La Liga medals, one for almost every season of his sojourn at the Bernabéu, during which Madrid utterly dominated the domestic competition. In all he scored 182 goals in 600 appearances for the club. Gento’s international career was rather less stellar, not through any fault of his own but due to the fact that Spain were not a significant footballing force during his era. He played in all three of Spain’s matches in the 1962 World Cup finals in Chile, captaining them against Mexico, but they were eliminated in the group stages, as they were again in 1966 in England, where he played in two of Spain’s three matches, both as captain. Despite his successes and his status as one of Europe’s finest players, like many a winger Gento yearned for a supposedly more influential position. “I am a dissatisfied player,” he once confessed. “Not with my club, my contract, nor my way of life. But with myself and these raw, bubbling elements of my ability which I try so hard and constantly to improve, and to make more efficient. I am also dissatisfied with my position as a left winger; accepting it gladly only because I know it to be the one in which I am of most value to Real Madrid.” He would have preferred to be an inside-forward. After he retired from a playing role at Madrid, Gento coached lower Spanish league teams in the 70s and early 80s, including at Castellón, Palencia and Granada, before taking on a long-term ambassadorial role for Real Madrid, where he was an honorary president until his death. He is survived by his wife, Mari Luz, his sons, Francisco and Julio, and granddaughters Aitana and Candela.

1/19/2022,"Consumer groups have warned the UK government against following Australia’s lead in allowing the booming buy now, pay later (BNPL) industry to regulate itself, arguing that approach has been “woefully inadequate in curbing consumer harm”. In a joint submission to a consultation process on BNPL regulation run by the UK Treasury, Australia’s Consumer Action Law Centre (Calc) and Financial Counselling Australia (FCA) said there were substantial holes in a voluntary industry code.  They urged the UK government to “design regulation that legislates consumer protections as the best way to reduce the negative impact BNPL products can have on a substantial portion of people”. Treasury is holding the consultation process following a review that in October recommended tighter regulation in the UK despite the government’s view that there was “relatively limited evidence” of widespread consumer harm. The industry has exploded in both Australia and the UK, although it has had difficulty turning a profit – shares in Australian-listed operators plunged up to 96% in November after a loss of $653m was declared in August by one of the big players, Zip. On Monday, minnow Beforepay, which is chaired by former Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer, made a horror debut on the ASX, with shares tumbling 44% from the offer price. In their submission, Calc and FCA said they expected the lack of evidence of consumer harm in the UK was “only because the evidence has not been collected, rather than that the detriment is not occurring”. “The empirical evidence of consumer detriment from BNPL in Australia is clear. Given the similar regulatory environments between our two countries and the similar growth in BNPL, it is likely that the experience of UK consumers will be much the same as that of Australian consumers.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The joint submission pointed to research by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in 2020 that found 21% of BNPL users missed a payment in the previous 12 months and 20% had cut back on or gone without essentials such as food to make their repayments on time. FCA’s own research last year showed that “BNPL debt is growing rapidly in the case work of financial counsellors, often as an additional debt on top of other forms of credit such as credit cards and personal loans,” the organisations said. “While it may escape legal definitions, BNPL is credit,” the FCA chief executive, Fiona Guthrie, said. “The relationship between BNPL and growing financial hardship is clear.” The organisations said half of the BNPL operators in Australia had signed on to the industry’s inadequate code. They said under the code providers did not have to assess whether repayments were affordable, meaning they were less likely to detect whether potential customers were vulnerable or likely to miss repayments and rack up substantial late fees. It also lacked meaningful enforcement powers, the submission said. “We urge the United Kingdom government to learn lessons from Australia’s experience and take steps to ensure these products have better safeguards, in a manner that puts consumers, particularly people experiencing vulnerability, first,” Tom Abourizk, a Calc policy officer, said.",Global,"‘Learn lessons from Australia’: consumer groups warn UK against buy now, pay later self regulation ",https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/jan/19/learn-lessons-from-australia-consumer-groups-warn-uk-against-buy-now-pay-later-self-regulation
1/19/2022,"A “clash of two crises” is looming when students return to New South Wales schools, as the Omicron wave adds pressure to a system that already faced severe and prolonged staffing shortages before the pandemic. As the state government prepares to release at Thursday’s national cabinet meeting its long-awaited plan for the return of students, school administrators have been warned up to 20% of staff could be forced off work because of Covid infections and isolation rules once classes resume early next month.  Despite the NSW premier Dominic Perrottet insisting schools will be able to return safely on “day one, term one”, the scale of potential teacher shortages has prompted concerns from unions and education groups about the ability of schools to function given existing staffing shortfalls. Documents seen by Guardian Australia reveal that at the end of 2021 more than 70 public schools across NSW had staff vacancy rates of 20% or higher. While many of those were smaller regional schools where a single teaching vacancy can disproportionately affect overall vacancy rates, the list also includes larger schools across metropolitan and western Sydney. At Barramurra Public School in Macquarie Fields in Sydney’s south west, for example, there were seven staff vacancies as of November last year out of a funding entitlement of 16.17 full-time equivalent positions – a vacancy rate of 43.29%. At the new high-rise Inner Sydney High School in Newtown, the 6.6 full-time equivalent vacancies amounted to a staff shortfall of 23.40%. There were also significant shortages at some larger regional schools. At Wilcannia Central School 8.4 of the 15.1 full-time equivalent positions were vacant at the end of 2021, meaning 55.63% of positions at the school were not filled. Walgett Community College, which was forced to close briefly in October due to a Covid outbreak, had nine vacancies – a 42.45% staffing shortfall. The president of the NSW Teachers Federation, Angelo Gavrielatos, said existing shortages would likely lead to the “clash of two crises” once schools resumed during the outbreak. “The crisis of absenteeism that will be the direct result of Covid but also the teacher shortage crisis that the government has known about for years but not acted on,” he said. “​There will be disruption due to absenteeism, and that may indeed render schools of non operational.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Gavrielatos said there was a “very strong likelihood” schools would close for weeks at a time due to staff shortages. “Regrettably, there will be disruption … as a result of the absenteeism that’s being anticipated,” he said. “We expect that there will be many instances where schools will be deemed non operational, either in whole or in part.” The NSW government has devised its return to school plans alongside Victoria, and will present them to national cabinet this week. The plan is likely to include the use of rapid antigen testing as a surveillance measure, with students to be asked to do two per week. The regime, which has been used in the UK school system, would require the use of about 24m tests during a 10-week term. On Tuesday, Perrottet said that while no final decisions had been made, surveillance testing was “absolutely” under consideration. Asked about the threat of Covid-enforced staffing shortages, Perrottet conceded there were “challenges” associated with the isolation requirements but said they remained “important in slowing the spread of the virus”. “Last year we faced difficulties and challenges as well. We had schools closed last year [so] there will be challenges as we go through the reopening of schools,” he said. “There’s no doubt about that. But we are determined to make it as smooth as possible. That will mean at times teachers who are positive will have to isolate. It will mean at times that kids who are positive will need to isolate. But that is a better issue to be dealing with than having our schools closed. We need kids back in the classrooms.” Opposition leader Chris Minns said the government had known about the staffing issue before the pandemic hit. “The lack of teachers in our public education system predates Covid by years,” he said. “We’ve seen a general deterioration, the number of teachers. Our great fear is that that will be exacerbated when teachers are off work because they’ve got Covid or they’re a close contact.” The Labor leader has called on the government to release modelling showing how many teachers are expected to contract the virus once classes resume. Opposition education spokesperson Prue Car criticised the government for considering calling on retired teachers to plug staffing holes. “We should be having a proper plan for how to deal with a surge workforce for teachers, not just a heartbeat plan to bring back retired teachers,” she said. Perrottet on Tuesday also confirmed the government was considering asking students in their final year of university to provide a “buffer” to staff shortages, a plan that has come in for criticism from teachers groups. Michael Wright, the acting secretary of the NSW Independent Education Union, was worried university students studying teaching could burn out before they graduate if they were pulled into classrooms to make up shortfalls. “We think it’s really unfair on those students to be thrown into a crisis situation and burn them out before they even start,” he said, adding that retired teachers also presented issues.

A spokesperson said the NSW education department had “published guidelines for the backfilling of staff, which include the use of the casual teaching workforce”. “This is to ensure that schools can continue teaching and learning, while affording a duty of care to students.”",News/Australia news,‘Clash of two crises’: fears for NSW schools as Covid pandemic and ongoing teacher shortages collide,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/19/clash-of-two-crises-fears-for-nsw-schools-as-covid-pandemic-and-ongoing-teacher-shortages-collide
1/19/2022,"Christine Walker has seen the politicians on her television continually repeating the same message. “They’re … saying, ‘Go and get vaccinated. Get your children vaccinated,’” says Walker. “They’re telling us all to go and do it … What are they doing to make it easier for the most vulnerable?”  Walker, 56, is at a loss. Her 21-year-old son, who Guardian Australia has chosen not to name for privacy reasons, has a rare genetic mutation that causes epilepsy, an intellectual disability, autism and a global developmental delay. He does not leave their family house in Melbourne except to go to the supermarket, which is the one place he feels comfortable. “At the moment we’re working on getting him to go to his sister’s house,” Walker said. “He becomes overwhelmed, overstimulated, and he goes into a meltdown. It’s too much for him. Eventually, because he can’t cope, he becomes aggressive.” In the past he has needed to be hospitalised to get other injections, so the idea that Walker could take him to a vaccination hub or a GP clinic is almost inconceivable. Last year, she called local GPs, who all said they could not do home visits, before the disability liaison at a Melbourne hospital put her in touch with Aspen Medical, one of the private companies contracted by the federal government to carry out “in reach” vaccinations in the aged care and disability sectors. But Walker’s experience this time around is eerily similar to the damning finding of the disability royal commission, which said the federal government’s in reach vaccination roll out had “de-prioritised” people with disability in favour of those in aged care. “Last time around we were able to get a team to come out and do the vaccination at home where he’s obviously more comfortable,” Walker said. “I called [Aspen Medical] again this week, to ask them to do the booster. “They were really lovely, very nice, but they said they’re trying to do all the nursing homes right now. So they can’t do him for another month or two.” Experiences like Walker’s may some provide insight into why vaccination rates for national disability insurance scheme participants – some of whom are more susceptible to the virus and were meant to be prioritised for jabs – remain lower than the general population. In August, Guardian Australia reported the story of a Sydney woman who managed to secure a vaccination appointment for her daughter, who has Down’s syndrome, from a private provider through Twitter. At the weekend, Guardian Australia revealed leaked data that showed people with intellectual disabilities and autistic people were less likely to be vaccinated than other national disability insurance scheme participants. They are even less likely to be vaccinated than the general population. And according to figures from last week leaked to Guardian Australia, only 14.8% of all national disability insurance scheme participants have received a booster. Overall, only 83.8% of NDIS participants have received two doses, compared to 92% of the general population. That’s despite NDIS participants becoming eligible much earlier than most people. On Tuesday, Labor’s NDIS spokesman, Bill Shorten, said those figures pointed to a “roll call of failure by the Morrison government”. “In particular, today, I’m calling upon the Morrison government to put from the back of the queue to the front of the queue people living with intellectual disabilities and people diagnosed with autism,” he said. Walker said she was particularly worried about being unable to get a booster for her son because he was immunocompromised. “Even a summer cold is enough to lay him out,” she said. “A flu can see him admitted to hospital. Covid would be so much.” Heather Renton, the chief executive of Syndromes Without a Name, has been supporting Walker to try to find her son a vaccination. Renton said there was not enough clear information to direct people like Walker about where to go. “It’s difficult when you’ve got a child who won’t even leave the house, when they’ve got a fear of vaccination,” said Renton. Guardian Australia approached the federal Department of Health and Aspen Medical for comment but did not receive a response by deadline. The Victorian Department of Health runs an in-home vaccination service for people with disability, via its disability liaison, though its website states the service is “currently not available for third doses”. The Victorian department of health said it would contact Walker to see what assistance could be provided.

Athletes whose sport involve throwing and tradies whose jobs require them to hold their hands over their head for a long time are also at risk of neck and shoulder pain, he says. “Excessive overhead activities can cause what we call a tendinopathy of the rotator cuff tendons, and that can lead to tearing of those tendons and significant pain.”  Pain can be a barrier to exercises, says Prof Michele Sterling, a physiotherapist and researcher at the University of Queensland. “But often, once people get moving – it can be quite a low-level or low-load type of exercise – their pain feels better.” She says people’s natural inclination when something is sore is to rest but avoiding movement can often be counterproductive. Sterling says there is no robust evidence that one form of exercise is better than another but research shows that exercise – as part of physiotherapy treatment – should be the first treatment approach. There is no fixed recipe for shoulder and neck pain treatment, and every person has to be assessed and prescribed exercise therapy by a physiotherapist, but here are some tips that can help you get moving. In a 2020 systematic review published in the British Medical Journal of Sports Medicine, Sterling and her colleagues compared the effectiveness of different physical exercises for chronic neck pain. The review included 40 randomised controlled trials. “We found that low-load motor control exercises and classes like yoga, pilates and tai chi are somewhat more effective than things such as stretching exercises,” Sterling says. Classes that have a strong focus on improving head, neck and shoulder posture can be highly beneficial in relieving neck and shoulder pain, agrees Hughes. If you have never tried these classes before, Sterling suggests to approach them with caution. “Listen to your body,” she says. “Start at a lower load, with pain-free movement. Then gradually work up to higher loads and stronger exercises, and as in the case of yoga, pushing more into the range of movements.” Lie down with a soft pillow under your neck. Flatten the back of the neck against the pillow very gently, nodding your head forward as if to say yes. You might feel the muscles at the back of your neck slowly extending but stop before you feel the front muscles hardening. Hold the nod position for five seconds, then return your head to the start position. “[The chin nod exercise] is really important for giving stability to the neck and supporting the neck by strengthening the muscles very close to the spine, at the front of the spine,” Hughes says. He says building up strength and endurance in this exercise is crucial, and the final goal should be 10 holds of 10 seconds. “Everybody could benefit from strengthening those muscles, but especially those who spend a fair amount of time on the computer.” Swimming is a great activity to promote stability and strengthen the neck and shoulders, says Hughes. But he warns that it might not be for everyone. “Swimming is certainly not for people with more severe or acute conditions.” Sitting and spending many hours in front of a computer are significant contributors to neck and shoulder pain. “Even just getting out of that position – walking, swimming, cycling or anything that gets you moving – can be enough to relieve the pain,” Sterling says. “It’s important the person enjoys it.” Hughes says lying on your stomach with your head twisted to one side can harm the neck. He also suggests choosing the right pillow for your sleeping habits. “If you lie on your back, you need a flatter pillow,” he says. “If you lie on your side, you need a higher pillow.” The focus remains a correct posture of the head, maintaining the back of the neck in line with the rest of the spine.",Lifestyle/Life and style,How to move: with neck and shoulder pain,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/19/how-to-move-with-neck-and-shoulder-pain
1/19/2022,"Just before I opened up a new document to write this, I set up a monthly donation to a charity. It took about 50 seconds.  I opened up the webpage of a charity, clicked on ‘Donate Now’, selected the value of my monthly donation, autofilled my contact details and card information and – done. I had been intending to support this charity for a while, but had not for the simple reason that I had not. And now that I have, there will be a small reduction in my bank balance every month and in truth, in time, I’ll probably forget it’s there. All the while, that money may be doing something good for someone else. Maybe you already give to charity – 80% of us do – nevertheless, there’s a very high chance that you could give more, and probably without even noticing it. Setting up a monthly donation represents excellent philanthropic bang for your time-spent buck. It also is often the preferred way for charities to receive money, in that it is stable and predictable. Setting up a donation within your pay cycle takes a little more time, but means that the tax is instantly removed from the donation, so it is maximum money to the charity, and minimum from you. The trick might be in choosing the right charity for you. Philosopher Peter Singer has his own suggestions for what makes for effective altruism, but other experts suggest doing some due diligence but giving to causes and charities which are meaningful to you. And while giving to organisations and people who are doing good work, or need it, is good in and of itself – there is a selfish kicker: studies show that people who spend money on others are happier. Literally, everybody wins (easily).",Lifestyle/Life and style,Easy wins: monthly donations – they feel good and give excellent philanthropic bang for your buck,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/19/easy-wins-monthly-donations-they-feel-good-and-give-excellent-philanthropic-bang-for-your-buck
1/19/2022,"Overworked paramedics across Sydney are being asked to drive ambulance vehicles home after their shifts so they can respond to emergency calls when they are clocked off as part of a crisis strategy during the Omicron outbreak. Paramedics in the city are already “drunk on fatigue”, said Chris Kastelan, New South Wales president of the Australian Paramedics Association, with many working 13-hour shifts in recent weeks.  Now, as demand for medical care soars and workers are caught up in isolation requirements, NSW Ambulance has begun placing paramedics across metropolitan Sydney “on call” – a practice traditionally only used in rural settings where smaller populations don’t require permanent overnight staffed shifts. In an interview with Guardian Australia’s Full Story podcast, Kastelan suggested it was unprecedented for paramedics to be on call in Sydney, where there were already designated overnight shifts. He warned that the conditions paramedics were working in now were becoming unsafe. “People will have done a 12- or 13-hour shift and then they’ll go home on call, so they’ll take an ambulance and equipment home. And normally on call in the Sydney metropolitan area is not something that gets utilised very often, you know, hardly ever at all … but in the last month or two, it’s become very common for people to be asked to take ambulances home,” he said. “They’ve just done a 12-hour, 13-hour shift, they’re just about to jump in the shower to debrief, to have a meal, to spend some time with their family, and then the phone rings again. “Then they’ve got to go straight back out … and they’re out for another four or five or six hours doing multiple calls. Now these people are, you know, they are drunk on fatigue. They are tired. They’ve got to back up and do it all again the very next day,” he said. A NSW Ambulance spokesman confirmed the agency had been forced to resort to on-call practices across metropolitan Sydney. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Kastelan said he knew of paramedics in Sydney suffering sleeping disorders, gastric upsets and migraines as a result of the heightened workload in recent weeks. “I’m just not sure whether that’s a safe workforce. “They want to help the community, and it’s very hard to turn off sometimes and particularly when there’s nobody left to do it.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Kastelan said he believed NSW Ambulance, the state government provider of ambulances, had leaned on the tactic in Sydney as a last resort. “I would suggest that the fact that that’s happening shows that the rostering or the staffing levels for both metropolitan Sydney and regional NSW is just not enough for the workload at this point in time,” he said. Pleas for paramedics to be on call while they rest are now common across Sydney, Guardian Australia understands. This masthead has seen requests from the north, south-east and western suburbs of Sydney, as well as in the Blue Mountains. An NSW Ambulance spokesman told Guardian Australia that “as we continue to respond to the surge in cases associated with the Omicron variant of Covid-19, opportunities for on-call rostering have been offered to staff in metropolitan areas who have expressed an interest and are willing to assist”. “On-call has been offered in line with the NSW Ambulance fatigue policy, to ensure staff are provided the opportunity to rest and recover, before and at the conclusion of their shift,” the spokesman said. The spokesman also urged the community “to ‘save triple zero for saving lives’ to ensure we can assist the most urgent patients as quickly as possible”. Last week, NSW Ambulance’s seven-day rolling average for triple zero callouts was nearly 4,500 per day. Prior to the Omicron outbreak, there had never been more than 4,000 calls recorded on a single day. Paramedics in Victoria were also under significant strain, following the red alert issued by Ambulance Victoria last week. However, Guardian Australia understands that authorities in Victoria have not resorted to placing paramedics in Melbourne on call. “We would never ever see that sort of arrangement happening in a regional centre in Victoria, let alone metropolitan Melbourne. So if they’re doing that in Sydney to cope that’s pretty bad,” a source with knowledge of the ambulance system in Victoria said.",News/Australia news,Overworked Sydney paramedics take ambulances home to be ‘on call’ during Omicron surge,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/19/overworked-sydney-paramedics-take-ambulances-home-to-be-on-call-during-omicron-surge
1/19/2022,"Environmental groups have accused the federal government of paying a record price to retrieve water for the environment by funding irrigators to make savings through efficiencies. The water minister, Keith Pitt, has announced the government will allocate $126m to Murrumbidgee Irrigation for works that it says will save just 7.4 gigalitres of water, and return 6.3 gigalitres to the environment.  But environmental groups say this amounts to paying a record $20,000 per megalitre for water in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, almost eight times what would be paid if the government was to buy water rights on the water market. The latest grant, made as part of the $1.3bn off-farm efficiency program, highlights the problems of the Murray Darling Basin plan as it reaches its final stage. When the Nationals’ leader, Barnaby Joyce, was water minister he put a stop to water purchases on the open market, citing the economic damage it was doing to rural towns. Instead the government is now relying on two programs: the so-called supply projects, which are meant to deliver 605 additional gigalitres of water savings for the environment; plus the off-farm efficiency program which is supposed to deliver a further 450 gigalitres for the environment. But, as the Productivity Commission highlighted in its five year review in 2019, these two mechanisms face real risks of failure, and may not deliver the water savings for the environment. It said the supply side projects were “highly ambitious” and could fail to deliver the promised water savings at a potential cost of half a billion dollars. The efficiency program was also criticised as it had achieved only a small fraction of the 450 gigalitres of water savings it was supposed to deliver – just 1% of its target – and did not take account of climate change. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The commission said both were far more costly than the alternative of buying back water from farmers. Acknowledging the failure of the $1.3bn efficiency program, which was originally to be spent finding water savings on-farm, Pitt directed $1.3bn to off-farm efficiency projects – mainly to the benefit of irrigation consortiums. Murrumbidgee Irrigation says the $126.48m grant will enable it to complete an almost decade long project to halve its water losses by reducing seepage and evaporation from open channels and automate its irrigation system. “This is the last component of all the works done to make our system as efficient as possible,” CEO, Brett Jones, told the ABC. But acting chief executive of the Nature Conservation Council, Jacqui Mumford, said it was “a scandalous waste of taxpayers’ money”. “There are far cheaper and more effective ways to meet the targets of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan,” she said. “If all water cost this much, the $13bn Murray-Darling Basin fund would only buy 647.5 GL, about 20% of the 3,200 gigalitres required to be recovered under the Basin Plan. “That’s almost eight times the most recent price paid for the permanent trade of general security access to water on the open market in the Murrumbidgee.” She said it could be the most expensive water ever bought by the federal government. “And where is the government’s cost-benefit analysis to show value for money? Or how about its water recovery calculations? “Water buy-backs are a far cheaper way to achieve the same result, and the result is more certain than forecast gains from water efficiency measures, which are highly uncertain. “With climate change making less water available, such large sums should be used to diversify regional economies rather than subsidise already planned works of private irrigation schemes,” Mumford said.",News/Australia news,"Government paying ‘eight times’ over market price for Murray-Darling water buyback, environment groups claim",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/19/government-paying-eight-times-over-market-price-for-murray-darling-water-buyback-environment-groups-claim
1/19/2022,"A new campaign targeting the 2.4bn litres of sugary drinks consumed by Australians each year is being launched by the Australian Medical Association as it steps up its calls for a sugar tax. The “sickly sweet” social media campaign, launched on Wednesday, highlights the role sugary drinks play in Australia’s obesity epidemic, with the average 375ml can of soft drink containing between eight and 12 teaspoons of sugar.  AMA modelling suggests a tax of 40 cents per 100 grams of sugar – meaning a can of Coke would cost 16 cents more – would reduce sugar consumption via sweet drinks by 12-18%. Frequent consumption of sugary drinks is linked to poor dental health and illnesses associated with obesity such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The AMA says Australians drink the equivalent of 960 Olympic-sized swimming pools of sugary drinks each year. The association’s president, Dr Omar Khorshid, said what was once a special treat had become an everyday product fuelling addiction and major health problems. “It’s a staggering figure, and we think Aussies need to know what they are consuming and the impact it can have on their long-term health,” Khorshid said in a statement to mark the campaign launch. “Sugary drinks are a ticking timebomb for the nation’s health and we urge Australians to choose water whenever they can.” The AMA is pushing Australia to follow the UK’s lead and introduce a tax on the sugar in the drinks – but only those that have no nutritional benefit. This would be all non-alcoholic drinks containing free sugars – excluding 100% fruit juice, milk-based drinks and cordials. The AMA modelling on such a tax suggests that sugar consumption could be reduced by up to 43,804 tonnes a year. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The tax excise is in line with World Health Organization recommendations for retail prices to increase 20% to have a meaningful health effect. Rosemary Stanton, a visiting fellow with the School of Medical Sciences at the University of NSW, said she had been calling for sugar taxes since the late 1960s, and while some progress had been made, it was slow in the face of resistance from the drinks industry and sugar farmers in Queensland. She said targeting sugary drinks made sense as they accounted for more than 50% of sugar consumed in Australia. “I don’t believe that people need to give up every grain of sugar, but 52% of the free sugars [consumed] come from beverages, so it is by far the biggest thing,” Stanton said. Jane Martin, the executive manager of the Obesity Policy Coalition, said that more than 50 other countries had introduced similar sugar taxes. She said not only were they working to reduce sugar consumption, but manufacturers were reformulating recipes to reduce the amount of sugar in products. In the UK, a tiered levy on sugar in soft drinks resulted in sugar levels in lemonades, colas and other soft drinks falling by 44%, with many companies taking out sugar to avoid the tax. Martin said sugary drinks, including slurpees that were targeted at kids, were cheap to make and had high-profit margins for manufacturers, but there was little awareness of the amount of sugar being consumed. “There’s so much pushback from the sugary drinks industry. They are making a huge profit out of this, and they don’t want that profit to be impacted, but it is profits over health right now,” she said. “Isn’t it time really that we put the health of Australians first and not the profits of sugary drink companies.” The AMA says previous modelling estimated that such a targeted tax would lead to a reduction in the prevalence of obesity by about 2%, leading to annual healthcare savings of between $600m and $1.73bn. It also estimated that the tax could, over a 25-year period, result in 16,000 fewer cases of type 2 diabetes, 4,400 fewer cases of heart disease and 1,100 fewer cases of stroke. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, has previously ruled out a sugar tax after the 2020 Australian of the Year, ophthalmologist James Mueke, made it a key focus of his time in the role. “We don’t think that driving up the price of household goods for families is the way of achieving this particular outcome,” Hunt said at the time. The Australian Beverages Council opposes a sugar tax, claiming there’s not enough evidence it would reduce obesity. “While sugar can play a part in poor diet, the causes of overweight, obesity and associated chronic disease are highly complex, and the key determinants include, but are not limited to, interactions between genetic, metabolic, cultural, environmental, socioeconomic and behavioural factors,” the council claims.",News/Australia news,‘A ticking timebomb’: Australian doctors use social media to call for sugar tax on soft drinks,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/19/a-ticking-timebomb-australian-doctors-use-social-media-to-call-for-sugar-tax-on-soft-drinks
1/19/2022,"A NSW GP whose family developed a close relationship with an elderly patient and allowed her to pay for his child’s school fees, buy him expensive medical equipment and build a small dwelling on his property for her care, and then benefited from her substantial will when she died, has had his registration cancelled. Dr Michael Cleary, who had been a GP for 40 years with an unblemished record before his treatment of an elderly woman known as Patient A, had his registration as a medical practitioner cancelled last month by the NSW civil and administrative tribunal.  Cleary was found by the tribunal, which was ruling on NSW health care and complaints commission (HCCC) allegations, to have “exploited” and committed “longstanding” and “recurrent” unsatisfactory professional conduct during his 15-year treatment of Patient A, who died aged 87 in January 2019. Guardian Australia reported last month on the case of Peter Alexakis, another NSW GP which the HCCC alleges breached professional boundaries with an elderly patient shortly before their death, something Alexakis denies. In the Cleary case, the tribunal found the conduct related to “boundary issues”, care and treatment issues and record-keeping issues dating back to 2009. The tribunal found the “boundary issues” included allowing Patient A to buy him a $40,000 device Cleary used for homeopathy, pay almost $140,000 for his children’s school fees, and provide $36,000 in other amounts, sometimes seemingly in the form of loans. Patient A, who Cleary described as like a grandmother to his children, made the payments to Cleary, his wife, and children. They visited each other’s houses for social visits, and he admitted inviting her to school functions and on family holidays. The tribunal also found she once lent Cleary her car for six weeks, which he and his wife used, but did not pay for the road tolls they incurred. According to the tribunal, Cleary told the HCCC that Patient A had wanted to become involved in paying the school fees, and had mostly discussed it with his wife, but he knew that she had been generous to his family in this, and other ways. “The real issue was that for many years she was part of the family and I accept I should have ceased providing her with medical treatment in these circumstances,” Cleary told the HCCC. The tribunal found that Cleary had given no indication of why he did not stop treating Patient A when it became clear the nature of the relationship had changed. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He was represented at the hearing by senior lawyers but did not give evidence, instead providing two statements, with the tribunal characterising this as engaging “in the most superficial” way. “Nothing … implies that the respondent regrets that he allowed his family to benefit from Patient A to the extent and for as long as they undoubtedly did, or reveals any insight into the inappropriateness of his conduct in continuing his professional relationship with Patient A in those circumstances,” the tribunal found. “In the absence of any explanation from the Respondent [Cleary], it can reasonably be inferred that only the death of Patient A terminated the Respondent’s family’s receipt of financial benefits from Patient A.” The tribunal also found that in 2013, Patient A arranged to have a small dwelling built on Cleary’s property, which would enable him to care for her if she became too frail or unwell to live on her own. It heard evidence the dwelling cost about $100,000 for Patient A to build, and “constitutes a not insignificant … benefit” to Cleary and his wife, but there was no evidence they had “any intention of reimbursing the estate of Patient A”. Cleary was also found by the tribunal to have failed in providing adequate treatment to Patient A, including by prescribing homeopathic remedies in place of other evidence-based treatment, failing to treat recurrent nausea and urinary tract problems, and prescribing oxycodone, a powerful opioid, without any clinical indication she needed it.

After Patient A was found dead in the bath by Cleary, the doctor then signed her death certificate and cremation certificate, stating that the cause of death may have been due to natural causes, or from a stroke-like attack or uncontrolled hypertension. The commission alleged that in doing so Cleary had failed to observe proper professional boundaries because other causes of death were plausible, and Cleary should have sought a second opinion from a medical colleague, given his close personal relationship with patient A. There is no suggestion the death was suspicious. But Prof Vicki Kotsirilos, an experienced GP who acted as an expert on behalf of the HCCC, found Patient A may have suffered from natural causes of death, including those stated by Cleary, but other plausible causes had not been ruled out, such as overdose of oxycodone or another drug, pregabalin, which could have been accidental or intentional. Cleary also said he did not know he or any member of his family would benefit under patient A’s will until after she died, and the tribunal found there was no evidence to the contrary. No findings of misconduct were made regarding the 2015 will, under which Cleary’s family received four-fifths of her residuary estate. Guardian Australia understands the estate was worth about $1m. Cleary did not object to his registration being cancelled and the tribunal heard that he planned to retire. He will not be able to reapply for registration for five years. No orders were sought with respect to his ability to continue practising homeopathy.",News/Australia news,NSW GP struck off after allowing patient to pay for child’s school fees and medical equipment ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/19/nsw-gp-struck-off-after-allowing-patient-to-pay-for-childs-school-fees-and-medical-equipment
1/19/2022,"Facebook ads were used to push unapproved rapid test kits to Australians, prompting a warning from the regulator, while users offered large volumes of rapid tests on Facebook marketplace, contrary to its rules. Facebook has a strict policy prohibiting the sale of health-related products on its platform, and closely controls the way companies can advertise medical products to its users.  But a search of Facebook’s marketplace and buy, swap, sell groups shows users are easily skirting around the ban, sometimes selling significant volumes of rapid tests. One user based in Sydney’s northern beaches, for example, is using Facebook marketplace to take orders for the JusChek brand rapid test, an approved brand, which will be met by placing a “bulk order through my business”. Users are asked to pay upfront for a future delivery that may arrive in “mid-February”. Three others were using Facebook to sell 20-packs of Panbio-branded tests, which are approved, in Sydney for between $200 and $300. Another listing offers unboxed kits on Facebook marketplace for $20 per test. It is against the law to sell tests without the proper instructions and it can be illegal to repackage and relabel kits. All of the marketplace listings were removed by Facebook after questions from the Guardian. Facebook has also pushed paid ads from foreign companies to Australian users which advertised unapproved rapid test devices. The Guardian found two separate ads marketing the BinaxNOW rapid test to Australians. That device has not been approved by Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration. The advertising of medical devices is strictly regulated by law in Australia, including on Facebook. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A TGA spokesperson said it would investigate “alleged non-compliance and take appropriate compliance action, if required”. “The advertising of rapid antigen tests, whether that’s through Facebook, an online marketplace such as eBay, or any other means, must comply with the Act, the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code (Instrument) 2021 and the advertising requirements set out in the Therapeutic Goods (Restricted Representations – Covid-19 Rapid Antigen Tests) Permission 2022,” a TGA spokesperson said. Another small company, based in Australia, was paying Facebook to push ads for the sale of the Clungene rapid test device, which is approved. The ads linked to a sales website that uses the TGA logo to help promote the device, something also prohibited by the regulator. The website included reviews from two customers. Reverse Google image searches reveal the pictures of both customers are stock images used across multiple unrelated websites for reviews. A spokesperson for the website denied the reviews for its rapid tests were fake: “Customer reviews are not fake, however the images used are. The customers leaving the reviews did not want their photos on the website whatsoever, which is fair enough to us!” The TGA logo was removed after the Guardian’s questions. A spokesperson for Meta, the company behind Facebook, said it had removed the advertisements and marketplace listings identified by the Guardian. “We’ve removed these ads and Marketplace listings because we prohibit anyone from selling Covid-19 test kits on our platform and are always working to stop efforts to circumvent our rules,” the spokesperson said. “While enforcement is not perfect, we have put several automated detection mechanisms in place to block or remove this material from our platform.

1/19/2022,"Nazeem Hussain will bring a new standup comedy show to the Adelaide Fringe festival in February – just don’t ask him to tell you what it’s about. “I’m really bad at describing my standup shows,” he says, trying to explain it. “Australia? My existential crisis? Australia’s existential crisis? It’s a lot of questions that I have and no real answers.”  “I think there’s a refund policy but I’m hoping no one exploits that.” The Adelaide Fringe shows are part of what will be – Covid-willing – the comedian’s first national tour since the pandemic struck. Over these past two years at home, one purchase has delighted Hussain above all others: a massage gun, which quickly became the highlight of his evenings. Here, he tells us about the life-improving qualities of that “nonsexual” device, as well as the story of two other important personal belongings. I’d save my massage gun. I bought it on a whim in 2020 from an ad on either Facebook or Instagram. There’s usually a huge endorphin rush with purchasing things online and it’s all downhill from there – when it arrives, it’s meant to underwhelm you. But this was the opposite – the massage gun has made every night happier. I know that sounds wrong – I don’t mean it that way! I just sit there on the couch, watching TV, massaging either my jaw muscles or my foot or my leg, or any other nonsexual part of my body. Please don’t make this sound sexual! Noise cancelling headphones. I feel like you’re in two worlds wherever you are – the place you are physically, but then also in your head. I feel like I’m “in” the music when I have my headphones on, and they also mean you don’t have to have unnecessary conversations with people as you walk down the street. I know it sounds like I don’t like people – I do. But sometimes having something like that visibly on your head means you don’t have to engage in small talk when your energy is low and you haven’t used your massage gun yet. They’re also good for work. I’ve got a nice home office setup now, but I used to like working in cafes and libraries. And the one thing that quarantines my space is the headphones. A bike. When I was in year six or seven, I saved up all my pennies over maybe two years and bought this brand new bike. It was a Malvern Star, and it cost $350. For my first ride I thought, I’ll go and buy my mum something. So I went to Woolworths to get her some milk and eggs. I got to the supermarket and parked the bike out the front. As I arrived, there were two people sitting next to me, looking at the bike. One of them goes, “Ooh, look at that shiny bike. Still got the tags on it. Those are some really chunky wheels.” They were just talking to each other, not really talking to me. And I think absentmindedly – I was kind of nervous, because they seemed a bit dodgy – I didn’t put the chain on properly. I went into the shop for five minutes, came out and there was just a chain hanging there. My bike was gone, and so were those two people. I had to walk home with the milk and eggs and the helmet still on my head. So I just hope they didn’t injure themselves riding home without a helmet on my brand new bike.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Three things with Nazeem Hussain: ‘please don’t make this sound sexual’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/19/three-things-with-nazeem-hussain-please-dont-make-this-sound-sexual
1/19/2022,"Every morning since January 2004, Rebecca Sharrock crosses off the date on a calendar in her room. Like many people, the 31-year-old uses it to keep track of time, distinguishing the present day from the ones that came before. Unlike many, Sharrock can remember what happened on specific days five, 10, 15 years ago.  What day was it on 21 July 2007? A Saturday, Sharrock can recall when asked. An avid Harry Potter fan, Sharrock remembers her stepdad going to the shops that day to buy a copy of the newly published Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The sensation of a warm breeze evokes positive experiences from childhood, as does a vocal workshop Sharrock attended at school when she was 13. “Coincidentally, on that day in late October in 2003, that’s when the US president visited Australia for the first time,” she recalls. (After we speak, I check this: George Bush Jr arrived in Australia for his first presidential visit on 22 October 2003.) Sharrock remembers her mother watching the news that day. “Even though it didn’t mean anything to me, him coming here, that memory [of the vocal group] brings back that whole day,” she says. Sharrock, who lives in Brisbane, didn’t realise there was anything unusual about her memory, until – on 23 January 2011 – her parents showed her a TV news story about people with an extraordinary ability to recall events from their own lives. The segment featured Prof Craig Stark, a neurobiology and behaviour researcher at the University of California, Irvine. Stark’s lab studies a condition called highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM), also known as hyperthymesia. Sharrock is one of about 60 known people in the world with the condition. In studies, Stark and his colleagues have asked people to recall memories from a particular day one week earlier, and also longer – one year ago, say, or a decade. People with HSAM are significantly better at recalling both personal and public events, and the exact days and dates on which they occurred. “They don’t remember everything,” Stark says. People with HSAM do forget things – but compared to people with ordinary episodic memory, “it’s very, very gradual”. Their extraordinary ability to recall lived experiences results from a type of remembering known as episodic memory. People with HSAM don’t, however, perform any better at standard laboratory memory tests such as rote memorisation tasks. HSAM was first recognised as a condition in 2006, after American woman Jill Price contacted the late Dr James McGaugh, a collaborator of Stark’s at UCI. “Whenever I see a date flash on the television (or anywhere else for that matter), I automatically go back to that day and remember where I was, what I was doing, what day it fell on,” Price wrote. “Most have called it a gift but I call it a burden. I run my entire life through my head every day and it drives me crazy!!!” Many people with HSAM describe a similar tendency to revisit days and test their recall of events, Stark says. “They describe things like, when being young, forgetting something and being really traumatised by it, not wanting to have that happen again.” Some structure their days using calendars, because they are able to remember the experience of marking off a specific date. “I’ll continue to have a calendar in my room until my last day of life,” Sharrock says. “I fear that I won’t know the exact date [otherwise] … Blurring days together – the possibility of that happening just scares me.” To a person with average memory, perhaps Sharrock’s fear feels something like the discombobulating sensation when a friend reminisces about a shared experience of which you have no recollection. “One of the things we don’t really know on these folks is how much of it is an inherent biological thing that makes their memory … better in this domain,” Stark says. His lab has looked at the brains of people with HSAM, but didn’t find major differences in structures important for memory, such as the hippocampus and amygdala. “We found some things in terms of the morphology and in terms of some functional conductivity [of the brain] that actually were more consistent with OCD than anything else,” Stark says, adding that people with HSAM also score highly on scales for obsessive-compulsive traits. While having HSAM can come in handy – Sharrock’s mum checks with her whether purchases are still under warranty – it also has its downsides. “I need to have distractions such as noise and light around me to get to sleep,” Sharrock says. “If everything’s quiet, memories just flash into my mind and that keeps me awake.” For Sharrock, who also has OCD, anxiety and autism, it makes bad memories difficult to deal with. “If I’m remembering something negative, my emotions of that experience will come back,” she says. “Sometimes people will say that I’m just deliberately not letting go, and I’m just like dwelling on the negatives in my life. “It’s awful to be a medical exception because very few people understand what you’re going through and there just aren’t many treatments designed for it. “Remembering this way just seems so normal to me.”",News/Society,‘It’s awful to be a medical exception’: the woman who cannot forget,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/19/its-awful-to-be-a-medical-exception-the-woman-who-cannot-forget
