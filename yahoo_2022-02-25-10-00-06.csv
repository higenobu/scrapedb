2/25/2022,"MOSCOW (AP) — Shocked Russians turned out by the thousands Thursday to decry their country's invasion of Ukraine as emotional calls for protests grew on social media. Some 1,745 people in 54 Russian cities were detained, at least 957 of them in Moscow. Hundreds of posts came pouring in condemning Moscow’s most aggressive actions since the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Vladimir Putin called the attack a “special military operation” to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine from “genocide” — a false claim the U.S. had predicted would be a pretext for invasion, and which many Russians roundly rejected. Tatyana Usmanova, an opposition activist in Moscow, wrote on Facebook that she thought she was dreaming when she awoke at 5:30 a.m. to the news, which she called “a disgrace that will be forever with us now.” “I want to ask Ukrainians for forgiveness. We didn’t vote for those who unleashed the war,” she said. There have been protests in different countries against the Russian attack on Ukraine. As sirens blasted in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, and large explosions were heard there and in other cities, Russians were signing open letters and online petitions demanding the Kremlin halt the assault, which the Ukrainian health minister said had killed at least 57 Ukrainians and wounded dozens more. “Public opinion is in shock, people are in shock,” political analyst Abbas Gallyamov told The Associated Press. One petition, started by a prominent human rights advocate, Lev Ponomavyov, garnered over 150,000 signatures within several hours and more than 330,000 by the end of the day. More than 250 journalists put their names on an open letter decrying the aggression. Another one was signed by some 250 scientists, while 194 municipal council members in Moscow and other cities signed a third. “I’m worried about the people very much, I’m worried to tears,” said Zoya Vorobey, a resident of Korolyov, a town outside Moscow, her voice cracking. “I’ve been watching television since this morning, every minute, to see if anything changes. Unfortunately, nothing.” Several Russian celebrities and public figures, including some working for state TV, spoke out against the attack. Yelena Kovalskaya, director of a state-funded Moscow theater, announced on Facebook she was quitting her job, saying “it's impossible to work for a killer and get paid by him.” ""I know that right now many of you feel desperation, helplessness, shame over Vladimir Putin's attack on the friendly nation of Ukraine. But I urge you not to despair,"" human rights activist Marina Litvinovich said in a video statement on Facebook, calling for mass protests Thursday evening. “We, the Russian people, are against the war Putin has unleashed. We don't support this war, it is being waged not on our behalf,” Litvinovich said. But the authorities were having none of that. In Moscow and other cities, they moved swiftly to crack down on critical voices. Litvinovich was detained outside of her residence shortly after posting the protest call. OVD-Info, a rights group that tracks political arrests, reported that 1,745 people in 54 cities had been detained by Thursday evening, at least 957 of them in Moscow. Russia's Investigative Committee issued a warning Thursday afternoon reminding Russians that unauthorized protests are against the law. Roskomnadzor, state communications and media watchdog, demanded that Russian media use “information and data they get only from official Russian sources.” Some media reported that employees of certain state-funded companies were instructed not to comment publicly on the events in Ukraine. Human rights advocates warned of a new wave of repression on dissent. “There will be new (criminal) cases involving subverters, spies, treason, prosecution for antiwar protests, there will be detentions of journalists and bloggers, those who authored critical posts on social media, bans on investigations of the situation in the army and so on,"" prominent human rights advocate Pavel Chikov wrote on Facebook. ""It is hard to say how big this new wave will be, given that everything has been suppressed already.” Despite the pressure from the authorities, more than 1,000 people gathered in the center of Moscow Thursday evening, chanting “No to war!” as passing cars honked their horns. Hundreds also took to the streets in St. Petersburg and dozens in Yekaterinburg. “This is the most shameful and terrible day in my life. I even was not able to go to work. My country is an aggressor. I hate Putin. What else should be done to make people open their eyes?"" Yekaterina Kuznetsova, 40-year-old engineer who joined the demonstration in St. Petersburg, told the AP. Russia's official line in the meantime remained intransigent. Speaker of the upper house of parliament, Valentina Matviyenko charged that those who spoke out against the attack were only caring about their “momentary problems.” State TV painted the attack in line with what Putin said in his televised address announcing it. Russia 1 TV host Olga Skabeyeva called it an effort “to protect people in Donbas from a Nazi regime"" and said it was “without exaggeration, a crucial junction in history.” — AP writer Kirill Zarubin contributed to this report from Korolyov, Russia.",World/Associated Press,Hundreds arrested as shocked Russians protest Ukraine attack,https://news.yahoo.com/russians-react-shock-outrage-attack-193719034.html
2/25/2022,"A Chinese news outlet appears to have accidentally leaked its own censorship instructions in its coverage of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

According to a now-deleted Weibo post, Horizon News, which operates under China’s state-owned outlet Beijing News, said that comments and reports deemed unfavorable to Russia or favorable to the West cannot be published.
 


The post appears to have made rounds on Tuesday morning. Eagle-eyed users managed to take screenshots and spread them on various online platforms before the original Weibo post was deleted.

China and Russia have no formal military alliance. However, they have strengthened their economic relations in recent years, becoming main trade partners.

In September 2021, Beijing supplied Moscow with computers, heating machinery, automobile parts, telephones and electric heaters, according to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC). In turn, Moscow provided crude petroleum, refined petroleum, coal briquettes, sawn wood and gas turbines.

During the opening of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that their “friendship” has “no limits” and “no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation,” according to Reuters. Additionally, Putin affirmed his opposition to Taiwan’s independence.

Russia, which launched its invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, is now facing an increasing amount of sanctions from multiple governments. But while most of the world has denounced Russia for its actions against Ukraine, China has yet to publicly denounce the transcontinental country.

“Simply put, China has to back Russia up with emotional and moral support while refraining from treading on the toes of the United States and European Union,” wrote Ming Jinwei, senior editor at China’s Xinhua News Agency, according to The Washington Post.

“In the future, China will also need Russia’s understanding and support when wrestling with America to solve the Taiwan issue once and for all,” he added.

2/25/2022,"Russia has seized control of the Chernobyl nuclear exclusion zone after an intense fight over the area, the Ukrainian government has said. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office, said: ""It is impossible to say the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe after a totally pointless attack by the Russians."" ""This is one of the most serious threats in Europe today."" Podolyak gave the update at around 5.30pm UK time, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the area was under attack at 3pm. Zelenskyy said: ""Our defenders are giving their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated."" Earlier, an advisor to Ukraine's interior minister warned if any strikes from the invaders damage the nuclear waste collectors, then ""nuclear dust can be spread over the territory of Ukraine, Belarus and the country of the EU"". The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry echoed Zelenskyy's warning, tweeting that a Russian attack on Ukraine could “cause another ecological disaster.” The exclusion zone sits just across the border from Belarus, and it is understood that troops entered the area through the country, which is closely tied to Russia. The Chernobyl plant is the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, which took place in 1986 after one of its reactors exploded. The plant sits on the border with Belarus and is directly north of Kyiv. The development comes as the Ukraine faced a bombardment by land, air and sea after Russia launched a full-scale invasion in the early hours of Thursday morning. The attack is the biggest experienced by a European country since World War II. Troops have poured across the borders with Russia and Belarus from the north and east, and landed on the coasts from the Black Sea in the southwest and Azov Sea in the southeast. The UK's ministry of defence confirmed that heavy casualties have been seen on both sides, but cautioned that exact numbers are not clear. Zelenskyy said Ukraine was listening to the sound of a new iron curtain falling as Russian troops advanced across his country.

He told the House of Commons: “Putin will stand condemned in the eyes of the world and of history. He will never be able to cleanse the blood of Ukraine from his hands. “Now we see him for what he is – a bloodstained aggressor who believes in imperial conquest.” Johnson said the measures are “the largest and most severe package of economic sanctions that Russia has ever seen”, but vowed to go further. “We will continue on a remorseless mission to squeeze Russia from the global economy piece by piece, day by day and week by week,” he told MPs.",World/Yahoo News UK,Russian troops seize Chernobyl nuclear plant amid warnings over spread of radioactive waste,https://news.yahoo.com/russian-troops-try-to-seize-chernobyl-nuclear-plant-amid-warnings-over-spread-of-radioactive-waste-152125424.html
