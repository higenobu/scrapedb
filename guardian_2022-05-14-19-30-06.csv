5/14/2022,"Boris Johnson has made a renewed call for people to return to the office, saying working from home does not work and that when he tried to do so he became distracted by making coffee and eating cheese. The prime minister said staff were “more productive, more energetic, more full of ideas” when in the workplace with colleagues. He said: “My experience of working from home is you spend an awful lot of time making another cup of coffee and then, you know, getting up, walking very slowly to the fridge, hacking off a small piece of cheese, then walking very slowly back to your laptop and then forgetting what it was you’re doing.” He added: “We need to get back into the habit of getting into the office. There will be lots of people who disagree with me, but I believe people are more productive, more energetic, more full of ideas, when they are surrounded by other people.” In the latest figures released by Transport for London, usage of the London underground at the start of May was still less than 70% of levels seen in January 2020, before the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced many to work from home. Businesses in city and town centres were hit hard by the consequent collapse in footfall, which has still not returned to pre-pandemic levels despite the government telling workers they should return to offices more than three months ago, after the peak of a Covid wave caused by the Omicron variant. “[Returning to the office] will get our city centres moving in the weekdays and it will be good for mass transit. And a lot of businesses that have been having a tough time will benefit from that,” Johnson told the Daily Mail. He is reportedly considering a campaign to try to get over-50s to return to the workplace. The government has continued to criticise the civil service for staff continuing to work from home. The minister for government efficiency, Jacob Rees-Mogg, told the Telegraph he suspected staff were only working three days a week. He has previously walked around government departments leaving notes on empty desks, saying: “Sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon. With every good wish, Rt Hon Jacob Rees-Mogg MP.” Rees-Mogg said staff were working from home on Mondays and Fridays because “they think that the working week is shorter than it really is”. “One can’t help but be suspicious about the desire to work from home on Monday and Fridays,” he said, adding that he thought staff were working from home when sporting events were taking place or the weather was nicer. Johnson has also criticised the civil service for what he claimed was a “post-Covid mañana culture”. Ministers have publicly blamed large-scale home working for the backlogs at the Passport Agency and the DVLA, and the Telegraph reported this month that in one government department only 30% of staff on average were at their desks on any given day. It was reported this week that the prime minister had ordered 91,000 jobs to be cut in a cost-saving exercise, with unions warning they could ballot for strike action over the plans. Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union representatives will meet government officials early next week. Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the union, which represents about 180,000 public sector workers, said: “Our members are in a state of shock. That the first they heard of these cuts was when it was announced in the media tells you all you need to know about what the government thinks of civil servants. “Our national conference in 10 days will debate taking coordinated strike action. If our members weren’t angry before, they are now, and rightly so.” He added: “We shall fight for every job in the civil service. Not just on behalf of our members, but on behalf of every member of the public who relies on the services they provide.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson urges more people to return to office working,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/14/boris-johnson-urges-more-people-to-return-to-office-working
5/14/2022,"The humble lettuce, stalwart of sandwiches, side salads and much more, is easily overlooked as a serious ingredient, but there is a gulf of difference between a buttery, sweet, tender leaf and one that is bitter from poor growing. Timing is important: if you hit the sowing windows at the right point, you don’t need to sow a great amount. For my household of two, both of whom love lettuce, we need 10 full-grown plants to pick from at any given time of year. For a family of four, where salads are serious business, I would grow between 15 and 20 plants. Rather than harvesting a whole head of lettuce, though, you should remove only the lower, mature leaves, taking up to only three leaves per plant in any one picking. If you grow them in this way, it is possible to start picking once the plants are six weeks old and continue for about 14 weeks before the plant is exhausted. To pick whole heads, it’s best to wait until the 10-week mark, so you’d need to sow roughly double the amount of seed to get the same harvest as from picking individual leaves. Many of you will already have sown lettuce in early spring. A second sowing now, or any time before the end of May, will yield supplies to last to the end of summer. You can then make another sowing around the last week of July to take you through the winter (although those lettuces will need protecting from September with cloches, fleece or tunnels). You can make one final sowing in September; this lot will need winter protection in either a polytunnel or a greenhouse, and won’t be picked until next March, tiding you over until the first spring lettuces are ready. I like Parris Island cos, which is a sweet, crunchy people-pleaser – I’ve yet to meet anyone who doesn’t like it. Give it plenty of space, because it can grow up to a huge 3kg per lettuce. My other go-to is Morton’s Secret Mix, (available from realseeds.co.uk) which would be my top choice if you’re only going to buy one packet, because you get butter, leaf, head and tongue varieties in reds, greens and splashes. Spacing is everything: leave 25cm-30cm in each direction between plants, or use a 30cm-diameter pot for each lettuce, so that they can have a decent root run. This will result in sweeter lettuce. The leaves only become bitter and tough when the plant is stressed from lack of water, either through competition or – and this is particularly true of container-grown plants – if the soil regularly dries out. For summer-grown lettuce, a little shade is often necessary, too. Finally, to deter moisture-loving slugs, water early so the plants are dry by the time they are out munching after dark.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Leaf or romaine: how to make your salad days last all year long,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/14/how-to-make-your-salad-days-last-all-year-long
5/14/2022,"The subpoena that was used by the US justice department to obtain details of a Guardian reporter’s phone account, as part of a leak inquiry, was issued by the Biden administration within the opening weeks of Joe Biden’s presidency. In a statement to the Guardian, the inspector general’s office of the justice department confirmed that the subpoena was issued in February 2021 – shortly after Biden entered the White House. The action was taken in an effort to divine the identity of an alleged leaker, who was suspected of divulging to news outlets details of an inquiry into the previous Trump administration’s policy of separating children from their parents at the southern US border. On Thursday, it emerged that the DoJ had secretly used a subpoena to confirm the phone number of Stephanie Kirchgaessner, the Guardian’s investigations correspondent. She had been the author of two reports in 2020 that revealed sensitive aspects of the child separation policy, including that Donald Trump’s then deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein had given the green light for children of any age to be removed from their parents. It was unclear at that point which administration had been responsible for issuing the subpoena, as the leak inquiry had straddled both the Trump and Biden administrations. Now the inspector general’s office of the DoJ has clarified that the move was made under the Biden administration. Stephanie Logan, spokesperson for the inspector general’s office which acts as the DoJ’s internal watchdog and which was conducting the child separation inquiry, told the Guardian that the subpoena had been issued in February 2021 in compliance with “the requirements of the Justice Manual”. The subpoena, she said, had been issued to a telecommunications company to confirm that “one specific telephone number already known to investigators … in fact belonged to a specific media outlet”. Investigators knew the phone number – Kirchgaessner’s, though Logan did not refer to the reporter by name – from their previous review of the phone records of an official in the inspector general’s office suspected of being the source of the leak. Logan stressed that “the subpoena did not request, and investigators did not receive, the content of communications to or from the account holder’s phone number” or any other other details of the phone account. The disclosure of the use of a subpoena to confirm a Guardian reporter’s phone number in a case that involved no national security concerns or classified information provoked strong criticism. The Guardian’s editor-in-chief Katharine Viner called the DoJ’s action “an egregious example of infringement on press freedom and public interest journalism”. In July 2021, the DoJ under Biden’s newly-appointed attorney general Merrick Garland announced a new policy that promised to restrict the use of “compulsory process to obtain information from, or records of, members of the news media acting within the scope of news gathering activities”. Advocates for increased federal protections for the press have complained however that there has been lackluster support from the Biden administration for stronger shield laws. Last summer Ron Wyden, the US senator from Oregon, introduced new legislation to protect reporters from unnecessary government surveillance as a response to revelations about the Trump administration’s heavy-handed surveillance of journalists at CNN, the New York Times and other outlets. Wyden told the Freedom of the Press Foundation at the time that he had tried to enlist the support of the justice department for his new Press Act, but officials within the Biden administration had failed to engage.",News/US news,Biden administration issued subpoena for details of Guardian reporter’s phone,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/14/joe-biden-guardian-reporter-subpoena
5/14/2022,"Out on the sunny patio at Wahpepah’s Kitchen, sizzling plates of bison and deer make their way down a table filled with Native American educators from across the country. The game meat joins other indigenous dishes on the kitchen’s menu, such as leafy salads topped with striped red corn and blue corn mush sweetened with berries and maple. Chef Crystal Wahpepah, the owner of Wahpepah’s Kitchen and a member of the Kickapoo tribe, is proud to see the gathering. Food is medicine in the Native American tradition, and her Oakland restaurant is all about bringing together Indigenous producers and ingredients – sustainable meats, fresh berries, heirloom corn and herbs – to help people heal. “Being a Native American chef is more than being a chef. It’s deeper than that,” says Wahpepah. “It’s about how you connect to the community and health. It’s about how we impact people and what we put in our foods.” In the seven months since she opened Wahpepah’s Kitchen, one of only a handful of Indigenous restaurants in the nation, Wahpepah has become the toast of the culinary world. She’s speaking at national conferences, preparing for a Food Sovereignty Symposium and Festival in Michigan, and is a finalist for the 2022 Emerging Chef award from the James Beard Foundation. But for all the buzz, Wahpepah’s overnight success has been a lifetime in the making. Wahpepah, 50, grew up in Oakland’s close knit Native American community. She’s registered with the Kickapoo tribe of Oklahoma, like her mother and grandfather. When her parents split, her father, who was Black, went back to Louisiana. She says it was hard being the only mixed-race kid in the family, the only one without a father in her life. But food traditions anchored her to her family and Native American heritage. “I ended up embracing it,” she says. Wahpepah, a graduate of San Francisco’s La Cocina food incubator program, launched a catering business 12 years ago specialising in Native American foods such as salmon, acorns, berries, and her grandmother’s Kickapoo bison chili. During the pandemic, when her rented catering kitchen closed, fellow Bay Area chef Reem Assil invited Wahpepah to take over her former restaurant space just under the Fruitvale BART station. Today, Wahpepah’s Kitchen is a bustling hub filled with bright colors and artwork that tells the story of the food they serve. A mural by the artist Votan Henriquezan depicts Indigenous food warriors from across the Americas, while columns painted by Diné artist Tony Abeyta are adorned with golden corn – Navajo symbols of fertility and sustenance – set against turquoise and cobalt blue clouds. Working alongside her three daughters, Rosario, Rikki and Kala Hopper, who are registered Big Valley Pomo, her sous chef Josh Hoyt (Ojibwe) and Ecuadorian head chef Diego Cruz, Wahpepah’s mission is to introduce people to real Indigenous cuisine while making sure her family traditions endure. Take the elderberries and blackberries she loves to cook with, for instance. “I find berries the most beautiful thing. It’s memories of me growing up and picking blackberries with my grandfather,” she says. “Those are the best times and actually one of the healing times for me. I believe life is a circle in how it all comes back; and if it did it for me it can do it for somebody else.” The Guardian sat down with Wahpepah to discuss how her upbringing and heritage shaped her cuisine, her passion for food sovereignty, and healing her community through food. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. Your food feels like what you’d be eating if you had a garden and were able to forage for seasonal food. How would you describe your cooking philosophy and approach to recipes? That’s exactly what we like to represent when you eat [our food]. If we look at how the universe works, we’re supposed to eat in a natural way according to the season. I also believe that our food shouldn’t travel that far. When you taste our food, you taste the cleanness and that it doesn’t travel. That’s my philosophy and I’m pretty sure I’m right. Some of our recipes, like the Kickapoo chili, are things that my tribe always makes. I also gather recipes from going to the library and reading Native American stories, and getting recipes from them. It’s been overlooked how beautiful Native foods are and where they come from. Our background comes from a lot of protein, so I specialise in game meat, such as venison and rabbit. My grandfather was a hunter, so when my brother hunts, he knows to bring it to me and I know how to cut it. How would you describe your mission as a chef, and what do you enjoy most about your job? Our food system is really pretty bad. It affects who we are, our energy, how you think. It has a lot to do with depression. My mission is to have awareness of our food, and at the same time make it visible to our community, using indigenous knowledge and expertise to transform the food system. And also to cultivate and sustain connections to Indigenous farmers. The most beautiful thing about being a Native American chef is the community and who you get to work with … In my early days as a caterer, sometimes I only got one catering job a month. I went to a lot of food sovereignty summits and catered for a lot of Native American organisations. Those are the people that made Wahpepah’s Kitchen. I wouldn’t do what I do without my community, here in Oakland but also all over the nation. And being supportive and actually being with Native-led people, and making a difference in every child and every elders’ life. Everyone can make a difference in our food system. You use ingredients like amaranth, purple corn and Oklahoma red hominy. Where do you find them? I’ve been very fortunate to work with Native American food producers. We have smoked cedar salt done for us by Sakari Farms in Oregon. The maple sugar comes from Michigan. Blue corn is from the Ute Nation in Colorado. The chocolate is from Belize. Wild peppermint from South Dakota, smoked salmon from the Lummi Nation in Seattle. A member of the Mono Nation in Fresno mills acorn flour and delivers it every two weeks. When somebody comes to see me from another state, they bring corn or wild rice. Deep Medicine Circle [a non-profit farm and Indigenous food collective] growing our greens. Everything you see on the menu is from a Native American or Indigenous producer. Anyone who comes into my life and can offer some positivity … I know that will transfer to us and the people who eat our food. How have you designed your menu for healing? We come from a gluten-free diet. When people ask what is gluten free [on the menu], I say everything, with the exception of the blue corn bread. If you want to indulge, indulge right, and the blue corn has a lot of good iron. And I like to offer a lot of teas, different berry teas and mint teas. You have wild mint, peppermint and yerba buena. Teas are healing, they’re comforting. Who taught you to cook, and what are your earliest food memories? My grandma Cecilia. My grandparents come from Oklahoma, and I used to go back and forth there from Oakland during the summer. I come from a family that cooks, and was always fascinated being in the kitchen with my grandmother and my aunt. I would always ask my grandmother, “Where did you learn this?”, and she was always telling me. One of the first things I made was dried corn. My aunt had a farm, pigs and the whole shebang. I was seven, and we would get the corn during harvest, cut the corn, and put it on window screens. That’s how you would dry it in Oklahoma, because it’s so hot, and it would dry for three or four days, and then we would have it for soups. That was one of the first things I ever made and and one of the things I pretty much always copy from there. Growing up in the Midwest, we did a unit on local Native American nations, but it probably was not at all accurate. Do people have a lot of misconceptions about Native American foods? We haven’t talked about fry bread – a lot of people think that’s what [all Native Americans] made. It’s not true. And I always knew that, just because of the different foods we had. [Fry bread] is more like pow wow food. It was something that was given to Native Americans on the reservation when they first moved onto them, probably in the 1800s. To this day we eat it when I go back to Oklahoma, but I eat it as a celebration, not as an everyday meal. There’s a lot of discussion today about food sovereignty with people of color, especially African Americans, but this was an issue first for Native Americans. What did being taken from your land and traditional ways of eating do to people’s health? It was pretty much [devastating] healthwise. Can you imagine being removed from your homeland? I can only go from my own experience, but my family has been affected with diabetes and lost their limbs, heart disease, cancer and things like that. Me and my sister were a year apart. And she died from cancer, leaving behind seven kids. It makes you think, if we just ate better, could we have done more to avoid this? It makes me want to work harder.",News/Environment,Chef Crystal Wahpepah on the power of Indigenous cuisine: ‘Native foods are overlooked’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/14/wahpepahs-kitchen-indigenous-foods-chef
5/14/2022,"This weekend’s expected pro-choice mass protests across America will no doubt feature signs and chants that call for, as social media has in recent days, “bans off our bodies”. But some of what many protesters wear across different cities will probably be a bit more cryptic. As well as green, a colour associated with abortion rights, expect to see “1973” emblazoned across sweatshirts, T-shirts, caps and tote bags. This is the year of Roe v Wade, the landmark supreme court decision providing women with the constitutional right to seek an abortion in the US. The historic ruling is now under existential threat and protests have been spurred by leaked news earlier this month that six out of nine US supreme court justices have signed on to a draft opinion that overturns Roe, with a final decision expected next month. The garments emblazoned 1973 are part of a range made by Prinkshop, a US company that describes itself as “a social enterprise that creates advocacy campaigns that are designed to be worn”, and sold on Social Goods, a site that sells activist clothing. Part of the proceeds for sales on Social Goods go directly to the the National Institute for Reproductive Health, a New York-based advocacy group campaigning for reproductive choice. In the past week, 1973 merchandise has been worn by Lizz Winstead, one of the creators of The Daily Show, who was speaking at a rally in New York, and by Benedict Cumberbatch and other cast members on Saturday Night Live. According to the New York Times, sales of 1973 items have surged since early May when leaked documents suggest the supreme court is poised to strike down Roe v Wade, leaving it up to individual states to decide if they want to allow or ban abortion. Imitation is always a sign of popularity too – there are now 1973 T-shirts available on Etsy and Redbubble. To wear this year written across clothing is a quiet but determined way to protest – even if passersby do not know the significance of 1973 in this context, it sparks conversations. “They get people to start talking and keep talking on the issues,” said Kate Sokolov, one of the founders of Social Goods. For the record-breaking Women’s March in 2017, the pussy hat – a pink, often home-knitted beanie with cat-like ears – became the choice to hit back against the presidency of Donald Trump and his famous “grab them by the pussy” remark, and those items are likely to be prevalent at Saturday’s protests. The Prinkshop range actually dates back to 2013 to mark the 40th anniversary of the Roe v Wade ruling. Amy Schumer and Busy Philipps have previously worn the items. Prinkshop founder Pamela Bell described it as a “slow and steady seller” and “a kind of a code”. Lisa Sokolov, the other founder of Social Goods, hopes it’s a code more and more people will understand. “Our goal was always to make a statement,” she said, “and that merchandise could be the catalyst for change.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,1973: how a year became a subtle way to rally for abortion rights,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/14/1973-merch-abortion-protests-roe-v-wade
5/14/2022,"Jacob Dunne loved getting into fights. Every weekend he and his friends would go into Nottingham city centre to start a ruck. One night in the summer of 2011, the 19-year-old threw a single punch. He immediately sensed it was different. There was no resistance, and the victim swayed back. “I knew something bad had happened as soon as I hit him,” he says today. Dunne didn’t hang around. Without a word to his friends, he fled the scene. A month passed and he began to forget about the incident. If something terrible had happened, he would have heard. But then friends who were out with him that night got in touch. They had been questioned about it. It was inevitable his turn would come. In fact, the finger was already being pointed at him. He discovered that one of his friends had given the police his name. One day, the police arrived at his mother’s house. He was out, so they called him and told him to hand himself in for questioning; nothing serious. When he turned up at the police station, he was arrested on suspicion of murder. Dunne discovered that 28-year-old trainee paramedic James Hodgkinson, the man he had hit, had died after spending nine days in a coma. Dunne was jailed for manslaughter. Because he admitted to his crime and there were mitigating factors (despite his predilection for fighting, he had no criminal record, no weapon was used, and James’s bleed to the brain resulted from his fall rather than Dunne’s single punch to the jaw), he was only sentenced to 30 months in jail, of which he served 14. At the time, Dunne thought he was unlucky. All he had done was throw a random punch on a night out scrapping with his mates. Others thought he was obscenely lucky. Some, including Hodgkinson’s parents, suggested he should have received a far longer sentence. Ten years on, he has written a book about the punch, and how it changed his life and the lives of others. Right from Wrong is part mea culpa, part love letter to his mother, and part manifesto on how to help children from difficult backgrounds to avoid the lifestyle he led. At its heart is the theme of restorative justice. Dunne has been able to rebuild his life largely thanks to Hodgkinson’s parents, Joan Scourfield and David Hodgkinson, who wrote to him and eventually met him in an attempt to understand the incomprehensible – why a stranger ran out of nowhere to throw the punch at their beloved son that killed him. It resulted in an extraordinary and complex relationship. When he threw the punch, Dunne had no qualifications and sold drugs to make a living. Today, he has two young children, a first-class degree in criminology, and talks in schools, universities and prisons about conflict resolution and restorative justice. We meet at his home in Nottingham. Dunne, now 30, is preparing his children for bed. Peppa Pig is muted on the TV while he reads to the kids. There are fancy-dress outfits on a clothes rail, toys galore and a children’s library. It’s an image of chaotic domestic bliss. Dunne carries the children upstairs, one in each arm, and returns a few minutes later. He puts the kettle on, and asks if we can go into the garden so he can smoke a cigarette. He is a warm, quietly spoken man. He appears relaxed, taking everything in his stride, but it doesn’t take long to discover the intensity bubbling underneath. How is he feeling about the book? “I’m excited and anxious,” he says. Why is he so anxious? “Because I’m so honest in it.” It’s true. Nothing is sugar-coated. We hear of his admirable achievements, but he also shows us an unattractive side, when he considered himself almost as much a victim as Hodgkinson was, and was determined to exact revenge on the former friend who he refers to as “the snitch”. When Joan and David initially asked him to explain why he had punched James, he couldn’t give a satisfactory answer. All he could say was that he had received a call telling him that things were kicking off, and he ran over to support his friends. It made no sense to Joan and David. So he started to think about his past, about what had made him into that young man. And this is what we are now talking about, sitting at the bottom of his garden on a cold spring evening. Dunne grew up on the Meadows in Nottingham, an infamous estate blighted by drugs, violence and criminality. By the time he was seven and his younger brother, Sam, was 18 months old, his parents had split up. His mother, a functioning alcoholic who worked as a registered childminder, did her best to bring them up. Young Jacob found it difficult to focus, but he got through his early school days easily enough. At secondary school, that changed. He befriended troubled kids from the Meadows, many of whom came from criminal or dysfunctional families. He couldn’t settle, acted the class fool, told teachers he wasn’t interested. He was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and told he was on the autistic spectrum. At 14, he was permanently excluded from his school, which said it could no longer support his education. He had never been violent, just a nuisance. Out of school, he had time to discover drink and drugs. He wasn’t tough, but he soon learned how to fight. “I felt a failure because I had failed in school, but I masked that with the bravado of being a lad’s lad. As I became more exposed to people who were hard, I became harder.” Did they make him prove himself? “Yes. They’d start a fight and expect you to join in. If you didn’t, it would be like, ‘What the fuck? Why didn’t you back me up?’ Or they’d say, ‘You’re not really about this life, are you?’ and give you an ultimatum. It was all about being tough; earning respect through intimidation.” He had been a keen athlete – the best hurdler in school, a decent basketball player and a competitive footballer. But after being kicked out he gave up on sport and the opportunity to be mentored by positive role models. His mother managed to get him into the local church school just before his GCSEs. But having missed 18 months of school, he didn’t stand a chance. “I didn’t turn up to do my GCSEs. I was, like, I know I’m going to fail and feel even more shit about myself.” With no qualifications, there were few career options available to him. And he didn’t much fancy a regular nine-to-five job. So by 16 he was selling drugs. Was he a good dealer? “Not really.” Did he make decent money? “Not really. The only thing that makes you a massive amount of money is crack and heroin, and I wouldn’t sell that because I would have had to have had it in my mum’s house and she was a childminder.” He wanted to protect his mother, whom he adored, which makes what happened later even more painful. “I could sell an ounce of weed and make £100. I sold cocaine, but more so I could use it for free.” At weekends, he and his friends would drink alcohol and snort cocaine. By the evening, they were sufficiently fuelled for a fight in town. Why did he get such a buzz from scrapping? “It was the adrenaline, and the sense of belonging. As you develop those friendships and values, the roots of those values go deeper and you struggle to see anything else.” Had he hurt anybody seriously before Hodgkinson? “Not seriously. Usually it was large groups fighting. You might fall and get kicked by 20 people, or stamped on. It was like a melee a lot of the time.” There was something cartoonish about the violence, he says. However hard people were punched or kicked, they always seemed to get up and walk away. Eventually the leaders started to carry knives. Was he one of them? “No, I was never a hardcore member, and I never wanted to kill anybody.” Did those who carried knives want to kill people? He thinks about it. “No, I don’t think they did. I think it was more bravado.” I ask if he ever got badly hurt. “I got bottled a few times and was unconscious on the floor. I used to have a shaven head, so you’d see a few scars in the hairline.” Did he get an adrenaline rush when he was getting battered? “Yes, the scars were all badges of honour. Another story to tell to your group.” By the time of the incident, he says, he no longer believed that violence had consequences. It was all just a brutal game. “We were oblivious to the fact that the stuff we were engaged in could seriously harm somebody. We had become desensitised to violence from a young age, particularly once we started drinking alcohol. Nothing really bad happened, especially because for a long time nobody carried knives, so the violence became normalised.” Saturday 30 July 2011 had been a gorgeous sunny day. Dunne and his mates were celebrating a friend’s 18th birthday and they started early with a few lines of cocaine. One of the older boys was flush with cash and took them to a bar where they drank champagne in the afternoon. They went from pub to pub, drinking and snorting all day long. One of his friends popped half an ecstasy pill into his drink to add to the mix. As the evening wore on he became separated from his friends, but continued drinking. At about 1am he got a call saying things were kicking off on Old Market Square, a couple of streets away. By now Dunne was steaming for action. Meanwhile, James Hodgkinson had enjoyed a boozy Saturday at Trent Bridge with his father and brother watching England play India in the cricket Test. The three had drunk steadily through the day and gone on a mini pub crawl in the evening. They were at their final stop, exhausted but happy and peaceful. James’s brother’s sunglasses had been taken by a friend of Dunne’s. James had gone outside to ask for them back, and Dunne’s friends didn’t take it well – they were spoiling for a fight. That’s when Dunne received the call asking for help. He ran over to the pub, saw his friend butting heads with James, fist clenched ready to punch. Dunne’s friend’s girlfriend pulled him away. That was when Dunne ran in and threw his fatal punch. After Dunne ran away and James fell to the ground, David Hodgkinson, James’s father, gave chase, but Dunne escaped. James was unconscious for 15 minutes, then sick five times in the ambulance. In A&E, they didn’t treat his head injury initially, saying he had drunk too much alcohol and should sober up overnight. The next morning, the hospital rang and said there had been a bleed on the brain and James needed surgery. When David arrived, James was unconscious. His last words to his son were: “You’ll be all right, it’s going to be fine.” After nine days in a coma, the family were told his brain, heart and lungs were failing. They agreed to turn off life support. Two years ago, Dunne made a moving BBC podcast series called The Punch. In it, he talked to James’s parents about how they had managed to build a relationship. “If I’d got hold of you in those early days, I would have tried to kill you, no doubt about it,” David Hodgkinson told Dunne in the podcast. “The anger and rage inside me were terrible.” Dunne admits he was also raging at that time. But he was more bothered about the friend who had ratted on him than the fact that he had killed a man. He was thinking about revenge. His lawyers had provided him with the statement his friend had made to the police implicating him. Dunne showed it to gang leaders and friends in the hope they would exact revenge on his behalf. His actions could have resulted in another tragedy. What were you thinking about, I ask. He shrugs. “It’s all centred around ego and pride. It’s just awful. Now I spend my time in schools trying to dispel all the contradictions that gang culture and that perspective on life has because none of it makes any sense.” Even though it was a ragtag gang, their code was based on the mafia’s omertà – ultimately the only thing that mattered was remaining loyal to each other. His mother showed him a different perspective. “She was worried about James’s parents. She was crying for them. She was going, ‘I can’t believe there’s another mum out there who’s lost a son.’” How did you react to what she said? “I was like, ‘Fuck, that’s the last thing I want to think about, Mum.’” He looks away, ashamed. Dunne was jailed in a young offender institution. He would tell fellow inmates about the snitch, and they would say that as soon as he got out, he needed to get his revenge. “My prison experience was counterproductive – it made me worse emotionally and mentally.” When he was released, he was homeless and jobless. He sought out the person who had given the police his name, and they agreed to give him £2,500 as payback. When he describes this in the book, it becomes clear how little he had learned from prison. While he was in jail he discovered Ofsted had stripped his mother of her registered childminder status because he had a conviction for violent crime and had been living with her. As a result, she got behind with her mortgage payments and had to sell her home. “I felt ashamed, but even then I continued to blame the snitch for what had happened.” It wasn’t until he began communicating with Joan and David that he accepted he was to blame rather than the friend he felt had betrayed him. When Dunne was released, his mother was living in rented accommodation. When he went into prison she had been a functioning alcoholic. By the time he was released, she was no longer functioning. A year later, she died. Dunne was heartbroken. Did he feel guilty? “Yes. I failed her. She believed in me; that I could achieve, and I never lived up to those highs.” He pauses. “Well, I did when she was gone.” Does he feel she might be alive today if he hadn’t killed James? “I think she would have gone, but maybe later,” he says quietly. After she died, Dunne belatedly developed a sense of responsibility. It was agreed with social services that his brother, Sam, then 15, would move into his one-bedroom flat because he was the person best placed to bring him up. Hodgkinson’s parents had been unhappy that Dunne received such a short sentence and unsuccessfully appealed against it. “I felt James’s life was worth more than you served,” Joan told Dunne in The Punch. They felt they had been short-changed by the justice system and that serving 14 months in prison for killing somebody was no deterrent. Their victim support team suggested they consider restorative justice, whereby victim and offender communicate through letters or meet with a mediator in order to help both parties come to a better understanding of what happened and the impact of the crime. (Government research shows that restorative justice provides an 85% victim satisfaction rate and a 14% reduction in reoffending.) They were also told that Dunne had little incentive to engage with it because he had already been released. But he did agree to the process. Why? “It was a lifeline. I was tormented by the impact it must have had on James’s parents. Even though I knew what I was going to hear would be awful, it was the only way I could understand the impact.” He says the first letters he received were “harsh and brutally honest”. Gradually the tone softened. They told Dunne about what James was like (fair-haired, slender, sporty, smiley and hugely loved) and asked him what he hoped to do with his life. “It astonished me that they wanted me to make something of myself. It gave me a lot of strength,” he says. Joan told him they had lost one person, there was no point in losing two. Dunne said he hoped to go back into education and get some GCSEs. David and Joan said they would like to meet him in person, but only once he had made a commitment to education. Dunne did GCSEs in English, maths and psychology. He got A* in all three, including 100% in one English paper and 92% and 94% in his psychology papers. They were the highest marks in his college. He then did an access course to get into university without A-levels. Two and a half years after they first wrote to him, Dunne met Hodgkinson’s parents on neutral territory. He was terrified, but by then Joan and David realised he was not the young man who refused to make eye contact with them in court; that he had worked hard to rehabilitate himself and had shown huge remorse. “I told them I wanted to go to university for them. Joan said, ‘Don’t spend three years of your life doing something you don’t want to do, you’ve got to do it for yourself. Going to university will give you a better career, but it won’t make you a better person.’” They have kept in touch and have seen the changes in Dunne as he married, had children, graduated with top honours in criminology, and taught vulnerable children about alternatives to violence. At the end of the podcast, Dunne asked if they could forgive him. Joan said: “In the beginning I wouldn’t have even attempted to try to forgive you. Part of me was, like, if I forgive you, it’s like James wasn’t worth anything. But working with you, and releasing the bitterness felt about everything else, I think forgiveness has come.” David told him he respected him for turning his life around, that it had taken guts to tell his story and that he knows James would have wanted the outcome they had reached through restorative justice. “But I can’t say, ‘Jacob, I forgive you for taking my son from me.’” he said. “The loss of my son is too great to be able to forgive.” Two years on, their relationship is delicately balanced. Dunne sent them Right from Wrong to get their approval. What did they think? “They didn’t have many comments. They didn’t like the fact I’d taken money from the snitch, so we agreed that if any funds are generated from the book, I’ll donate that amount to a charity. That was their suggestion.” David and Joan have told Dunne they want to withdraw from the media and try to get on with their own lives. But he is aware the book may cause them renewed pain. Dunne is in an uncomfortable position: he has managed to rebuild his life, while David and Joan grieve. He has been able to present a successful podcast and publish a book because he killed an innocent man. Has he talked to them about how they feel about him profiting from his crime? (He received a £20,000 advance for the book, though that includes payment for his ghost writer and agent.) “The thing came up about the snitching, but other than that, no. I would happily give any profit to charity, but I would rather use it to develop my own community projects.” He hopes to show young men alternatives to violence and crime, not just by talking but by doing activities with them. “I want to get a minibus and take young people from the inner city out hiking. I want to sit down and have grownup chats, and show them what being a responsible male is.” His wife comes home from work and brings us pizza. We eat and chat while the kids sleep upstairs. Dunne talks about his plans. He has been working part-time as a driver for his father-in-law while finishing the book, and now he’s exploring how he can use his degree and lived experience to make a difference. In his van on the way back to the station, it emerges that things are not quite as rosy as they appear. Life at home is proving difficult, but he and his wife are trying to make things work. He has depression and post‑traumatic stress disorder. He doesn’t know where he is heading next career-wise, and is anxious that his book could bind him to his crime rather than help him move on. But he is sure of one thing. He wants to do some good with his life, for the sake of his mother, for Joan and David, and for James. We talk about the 18-year-old Jacob and the anger and self-pity he felt after killing James with that single punch. How does he feel about his younger self now? “I want to give him a hug because he didn’t have a clue what was going on and he didn’t have the tools to try to navigate any of that stuff with any likelihood of a positive outcome.” Back then, he felt he had been dealt a terrible hand by fate and the friend that betrayed him. Would he say he was unlucky now? He shakes his head. “No, I’m lucky. I’ve got a lot to be grateful for.”  Right from Wrong by Jacob Dunne is published by HarperNorth at £16.99.

5/14/2022,"Adrián Cordero Vega ended it a second too early and not a moment too soon. The clock said 89.59 when the referee blew but it had been over almost from the start, and not just last night. Levante were a goal down after 12:42 at the Bernabéu; they were down-down as well, no longer able to resist the inevitable, the fate they had fought. “We’ve been been given up for dead many times but keep rising again,” said Alessio Lisci, their third coach this season and the only one to win a game, but this was a resurrection too far. Now they just wanted it finished, nothing left to give. “The players suffered the unspeakable,” their president said when at last it was, relegation confirmed long after it was known. Six days earlier, Alessio said he “almost had a heart attack” when Gonzalo Melero’s last-minute penalty gave Levante a lifeline with a 2-1 win against Real Sociedad. A fortnight before, José Luis Morales, the captain, had broken down when he missed one of his own that would have equalised against Sevilla, but either side of that they had drawn with Valencia and hammered Granada 4-1. They had also beaten Villarreal 2-0. In six matches since the start of April, they had won three and lost two and those were 3-2s against Sevilla and against Barcelona, via a 92nd-minute Luuk de Jong goal. All of which meant they arrived at the Bernabéu knowing that if they could beat Real Madrid they might just still survive. After all, their next game would be against Cádiz, an opportunity against the team they had to catch, and their final match was against Rayo Vallecano, left with nothing to play for. They had won twice in three years at the Bernabéu and Madrid were already champions. They would be handed a guard of honour, which might soften them. And Madrid might even rotate. Even a draw would give Levante a tiny chance, allowing them to fight another day. No, it wasn’t likely, but it was something to cling to – a burning nail, as the Inquisition-inspired idiom has it. “We knew what Cádiz had done [losing 3-0 at Real Sociedad] and we knew that if we could win here, we could get closer, but it wasn’t to be. Madrid rolled over us after the first goal,” Sergio Postigo said afterwards. Ferland Mendy ran free to score it after 12 minutes. “That did us a lot of damage; you start thinking things you don’t want to be thinking … and then you succumb,” Morales admitted. If that wasn’t bad enough, Karim Benzema scored the second six minutes later. And that goal, Lisci said, “killed us”. It was done, they were already dead, but Madrid didn’t stop. Rodrygo made it three on 33 minutes, and Vinícius Júnior scored the fourth just before half-time. Three times Madrid had hit the post, too. High in the north-east corner, about 400 Levante fans continued to sing. At one point, they even chanted “yes, we can”, but they knew they couldn’t. It was hard to watch: a team of players gone, yet obliged to stay there, taking the hits, barely able to protect themselves. Goalkeeper Dani Cárdenas, seen from close up, was a particularly tough watch. The ball in his net, he sat and stared into space, broken. He made saves – lots of them – but was still a picture of powerlessness, kicking the post, lurching as he stood alone, spasms of anger and frustration. It was as if he was desperately trying to shout it all out, shake it from his body, but it wouldn’t leave him and he couldn’t leave here. At half-time, despite being the furthest away, he was the first down the tunnel, just wanting out and fast. They had all felt much the same way, this becoming a suffering, an act of penitence. It had been over on 12.42, but Madrid kept coming, ultimately rattling off almost 30 shots. For Levante, there were more than 77 minutes to endure, watching their own slow, inevitable descent into the second division, much as they had all season. For Vinícius, it was time to enjoy. Asked if he wanted to come off and rest in the second half, the Brazilian said no: he had a hat-trick to get, which he did. Benzema bamboozled Cárdenas to set one of them up. “Madrid dance on Levante’s tomb,” AS’s headline declared. “It’s a sad day for Levante. The best way to respect an opponent is to do your best,” Carlos Ancelotti said. This had hurt, the final blow followed by more and more of them. It was 6-0 and everyone had seen enough. The referee, a profession not normally known for its empathy, brought it to an end early, an act of mercy. After five years, a fun time in primera, Levante were bottom and down, two weeks early. On the bench, Morales hid in the shadows, shirt over his face crying. Francisco Son was sobbing. Rúben Vezo came to comfort teammates, a tear of his own visible on his cheek. “All I can say is sorry,” the captain said when at last he could get some words out. “It’s terribly, terribly difficult. We weren’t good enough.” The words that most hit were maybe the simplest of all. One journalist had presumably miscalculated the league table – Levante can actually still match Cádiz for points, but they have lost the head-to-head record – and asked Lisci how he was going to motivate his players for the final, almost impossible push. The coach paused a moment, hesitating, as if not sure what to say, how to break the news, then replied softly: “We’re down, Eugenio.” There was a dignity in the way Lisci had responded; a dignity too in the way he had led his team, taking over in an emergency, a young coach in his first job trying to fix a problem not of his making. This was “cruel, but it is what it is”, Postigo said, “we weren’t worthy of this division”. “A culmination of mistakes,” the president Quico Catalan called it, putting his own position in the hands of the foundation that owns the club. Financially, they face a €10m shortfall, the signings had almost no impact, the sporting director was sacked and they have been through three coaches. The first of them, Paco López, is Levante: the former player and B team coach took over in 2018 and won eight of 11 to save them, then comfortably kept them in primera for four years. But they picked up only four points in eight games, the total winless run stretching back 16 matches, and he was sacked. Last night Catalan admitted that he didn’t know if that had been a mistake; at the time there was a feeling that something profound had broken, and things didn’t improve. Under Javier Pereira, largely unknown and arriving from China to take his first job in Spain, things didn’t improve: they collected three points from seven games. When Lisci, promoted from the B team and the youngest manager in the first division, led Levante to victory over Mallorca in January, it was their first win in 273 days. Twenty-seven games was the longest winless run in Spanish history. The season was 20 weeks in, all those points irrecoverable now. “In the first half of the season we didn’t compete,” Lisci said. Under him, Levante collected 22 points from 21 games: just about enough extrapolated over a whole season but not half of one. Levante were always playing catch-up and never really could, survival within sight but not truly within reach. “We’re the ones to blame: we’re the ones that went 27 without winning, the ones who reacted too late,” Morales said. Asked whether he could explain relegation Postigo replied: “Yes: what we did last season [when Levante didn’t win any of their last eight games] was contagious. We went weeks without winning and that weighed upon us. We didn’t have the maturity to turn it around, that millstone was too big. It’s hard to win so many consecutive games in primera. We’re bottom and haven’t been close to fighting until these final weeks. The team reacted, but very late. We’ve done a decent second half but it’s not enough.” They hadn’t been relegated in the Bernabéu; the surprise maybe was that they had got that far still standing, not how quickly and completely they crumbled against the best team there is. “This side has gone a very long time with an incredible mental fatigue,” Lisci said. “You play life or death all that time, with all that tension, and the second goal overwhelms everyone.” Levante will be missed; it’s been fun. This is the team that beat Atlético away and drew 2-2 with them at home, that drew 3-3 with Madrid, lost 3-2 to Barcelona and Sevilla, 4-3 to Valencia and Espanyol, 4-2 to Betis and 5-3 to Sevilla; that last year lost 4-2 to Valencia, drew 3-3 with Barcelona, beat Betis 4-3 and twice defeated the champions. This time, when it came to the last chance, they couldn’t. And so it ends, which it had almost from the start. There are just two games left; finally released, maybe now they can just play, appreciate what they had these five years. “Let’s not waste a single minute left in primera because who knows if we will tread this ground again one day,” Morales said.",Sport/Football,Dignity and doom: Levante succumb to inevitable in Bernabéu mauling | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/14/dignity-and-doom-levante-succumb-to-inevitable-in-bernabeu-mauling
