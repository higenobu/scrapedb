12/11/2021,"A now-viral video of a woman accusing a Black man of stealing her phone only for it to be in her purse has outraged critics online. The video posted on TikTok by user @fuxktdub on Monday, Dec. 6 has since garnered over 2.1 million views with the headline caption, “Karen really pulled this at a Spencer’s. r@sism alive and well.” The altercation appeared to have occurred at a Spencers store in an unknown location, and the video starts with the unidentified woman rummaging through her purse. Another woman could be heard in the background asking the store clerk if he could assist by calling the accusing woman’s cellphone, noting that she had refused to give them her number to call it. “9-1-6,” she started before claiming the Black man could’ve turned off the ringer. The woman from earlier inserted sarcastically that maybe she would’ve wanted them to get naked to verify they don’t have her cellphone. The woman continued riffling through her purse as the clerk attempted to calm everyone. Still, the accusing woman continued to say the man took her phone, despite his step of emptying his pockets and showing his vape. “I just stuck it right here, you walked right behind me, and you took it,” the shopper said. The other woman who apparently was the man’s companion tried to get her to work with the store clerk to call her phone. The accuser had to be reminded during the exchange that she still had to give her phone number to find her cellphone. Ultimately it was called, and the woman immediately apologized and cited confusion for her misplacing her device. However, the two did not accept her apology and started to walk off, but not before a parting “f-ck” at the woman’s claims that she was sorry. Social media users had assumptions about what transpired between the woman and the couple, many of whom believed she knew she had found her phone long before she publicly admitted it. “She has an Apple Watch?” questioned one user. “She could’ve literally pinged her phone from her watch ?!? People are wild.” “She didn’t wanna call her phone because she saw it in her bag and knew you were recording…smh,” claimed a second person. A third person pointed out, “The way she was stalling tryna come up with a backup plan after she felt it in her purse.” “Her face was so red because she found it in her bag,” added a fourth person. “And look at how she continues to lie even after she found it.” More news from our partners: Testimony Wraps In Trial of California Ex-Cop Charged with Lying About His Arrest of Black Man Minding His Business While Waiting for Friends: ‘I Was Not Free to Leave’ ‘They Will Have To Move Or Live In Fear’ | Indiana Father Accused Of Shooting Son’s Youth Football Coach California Couple Sues Appraiser Over What They Say Was Racial Bias In Home Valuation Lowballed By $500K",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,"‘The Way She Was Stalling’: Woman Falsely Accuses Black Man of Stealing Her Phone Until It Rings In Her Purse, Thanks to a Store Clerk",https://news.yahoo.com/way-she-stalling-woman-falsely-173000029.html
12/11/2021,"Social-justice organization Black Lives Matter is still standing with Jussie Smollett after the actor was convicted Thursday of staging a racist, homophobic attack and lying to police about it. But his old friend Don Lemon, the CNN anchor who once defended him amid allegations of a hoax, is not supporting him. Smollett, best known for his role on the TV series ""Empire,"" was found guilty Thursday on five of six counts of disorderly conduct. His attorneys say they plan to appeal the decision, which legal experts have said bears a light penalty for the actor that would likely include probation and community service. The charges stemmed from a January 2019 incident in downtown Chicago. Smollett, 39, told Chicago police at the time that he had been attacked by two masked assailants who hurled racist and anti-gay slurs at him as they hit him, poured a chemical substance on him and put a rope around his neck. As authorities investigated the incident as a possible hate crime, numerous celebrities, politicians and other public figures spoke out in support of Smollett in 2019 and condemned the alleged attack. Earlier this week, BLM backed Smollett during his criminal trial. After the verdict was announced late Thursday, BLM Los Angeles leader Melina Abdullah told TMZ that its stance hasn't changed and Smollett still has the organization's full support. Representatives for BLM did not immediately respond Friday to The Times' request for comment. ""As abolitionists, we approach situations of injustice with love and align ourselves with our community. Because we got us,"" BLM said in a Tuesday statement. ""So let’s be clear: we love everybody in our community. It’s not about a trial or a verdict decided in a white supremacist charade, it’s about how we treat our community when corrupt systems are working to devalue their lives. In an abolitionist society, this trial would not be taking place, and our communities would not have to fight and suffer to prove our worth."" The organization also blasted the Chicago Police Department, which it said has ""has proven time and again to have no respect for our lives."" ""In our commitment to abolition, we can never believe police, especially the Chicago Police Department (CPD) over Jussie Smollett, a Black man who has been courageously present, visible, and vocal in the struggle for Black freedom,"" Tuesday's statement continued. ""Black Lives Matter will continue to work towards the abolition of police and every unjust system. We will continue to love and protect one another, and wrap our arms around those who do the work to usher in Black freedom and, by extension, freedom for everyone else."" Meanwhile, Lemon turned his back on Smollett during his CNN show Thursday night, calling the actor a liar who made it more difficult for real victims of hate crimes to come forward. ""He had to make up too many lies as to why he didn't want to do certain things ... to cover. Like another lie — and I guess he got caught up in that because he took the stand himself,"" Lemon said on ""Don Lemon Tonight."" ""He got angry with the prosecutor as the prosecutor poked holes in his story — calling the only other witnesses liars."" Lemon added: ""Here's what folks are concerned about — that what he did might undermine future victims, legitimate victims of hate crimes."" Lemon didn't mention that his own name came up during the trial. Smollett testified that the CNN host allegedly sent him a message informing him that Chicago police didn't believe his account of what happened the night of the alleged attack — a revelation that spurred ethical questions for the journalist. When the verdict was handed down Thursday, conservatives on Twitter also skewered the actor, as well as the liberal public figures who defended him — President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, among them — in the initial stages of the investigation. ""Tonight, Jussie Smollett can rest knowing that his attacker has been convicted,"" tweeted conservative pundit Ben Shapiro. Times staff writer Tracy Brown contributed to this report.

12/11/2021,"An American student is sparking plenty of confused comments after sharing what it’s like to attend a university in Austria. College student Morgan Lee (@mooorganic) shared the revelations in a now-viral TikTok, during which she broke down the biggest “culture shocks” she’s faced since moving to Europe. Some of her discoveries — including the fact that students can apparently take their exams “whenever” they want — left many Americans feeling jealous. Traveling home for the holidays? Here are 4 things you need to do right now Lee’s video is part of a long-standing trend on the app. In the past, TikTokers have shared all kinds of cross-cultural discoveries.  Recently, an Australian user blew viewers’ minds after sharing that in his country, certain fruits have vastly different names. In another clip, an American TikToker detailed what happened when she tried to order “chips and salsa” in Italy.   Lee’s video featured some similarly hilarious realizations. Among her biggest culture shocks is the fact that Europeans have a totally different understanding of what “first floor” means.  As she explains in the clip, many countries (including Austria) list the first floor of buildings as the first floor above ground level. The ground floor, meanwhile, is usually floor zero.  Lee was also blown away by the fact that, at some schools, students can “delay” their exams if they’re not ready to take them. In the comments, Lee followed up with a claim that one of her friends has waited three and a half years to take an exam because she’s “scared” to sit for it. Lastly, Lee discussed Austria’s national holidays. In several European nations, there are a number of countrywide public holidays — sometimes referred to as bank holidays — where many businesses and schools close completely.  Create sweet treats with the kids this holiday season with help from Walmart: “I swear, I learn something new every day,” Lee captioned the video. Many TikTok users seemed to learn a lot as well. Many commented to share just how wild they found Lee’s discoveries.  “The thing with tests. I WANT THAT,” one user wrote.  “When I think about it, the floor thing kind of makes sense,” another added. “I would never take an exam,” another wrote.

12/11/2021,"WASHINGTON — The chief justice of the United States, John Roberts, warned Friday that the Supreme Court risks losing its own authority if it allows the existence of a law like Texas’ near-total abortion ban, which attempts to circumvent the courts. In a strongly worded opinion joined by the high court’s three liberal justices, Roberts wrote that the ""clear purpose and actual effect"" of the Texas law was ""to nullify this Court’s rulings."" That, he said, undermines the Constitution and the fundamental role of the Supreme Court and the court system as a whole. The opinion was a remarkable plea by the chief justice to his colleagues on the court to resist the efforts by right-wing lawmakers to get around court decisions they dislike, in this case Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that made abortion legal in the United States, within limits. But in this case, his urgent request was largely ignored by the other justices on the court who were appointed by Republicans. His point to them was that the court system should decide what the law is, and it should resist efforts like that of the Texas Legislature to get around the courts by limiting the ability of abortion providers to sue. It is a basic principle, he wrote, ""that the Constitution is the 'fundamental and paramount law of the nation,' and '[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.'"" He cited as proof the landmark 1803 Marbury v. Madison case, which established the principle of judicial review, allowing the court to nullify laws that violate the Constitution. “If the legislatures of the several states may, at will, annul the judgments of the courts of the United States, and destroy the rights acquired under those judgments, the Constitution itself becomes a solemn mockery,” he said, quoting the 1809 U.S. v. Peters case, which found that state legislatures can't overrule federal courts. “The nature of the federal right infringed does not matter; it is the role of the Supreme Court in our constitutional system that is at stake.” The Texas law, which took effect in September, delegates enforcement to any person, anywhere, who can sue any doctor performing an abortion or anyone who aids in the procedure. That makes it virtually impossible for abortion providers to sue the state to block the law, S.B. 8. Texas has argued that the law's opponents had no legal authority to sue the state because S.B. 8 does not give state officials any role in enforcing the restriction. Roberts has said that politics has no place at the Supreme Court and has made it clear he will resist efforts to draw the court into partisan cultural fights, fearing that the perception of partisanship will undermine the court's legitimacy. With the court now having a 6-3 conservative supermajority, Roberts wound up siding with the three liberal justices: Elena Kagan, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. The addition of three justices by former President Donald Trump meant Roberts could not find another vote for his position, leaving him largely in the minority in the abortion ruling. Melissa Murray, a law professor at New York University, said Friday on MSNBC that “the real question here is whether or not Chief Justice John Roberts is chief justice in principle as well as name.” “The question here is how can he reign in that hardcore conservative bloc of the court?"" she asked. ""And it seemed obvious last week in oral arguments, and this week — in terms of how these opinions are written, and where the chief justice finds himself — that maybe he's having a hard time keeping all of the conservative bloc in line.” The Supreme Court ruling Friday said that abortion providers in Texas can move forward with their lawsuit challenging S.B. 8 along a very narrow path. But it kept the law in effect while the court battle unfolds, which abortion rights supporters said would prevent large numbers of low-income Texas women from obtaining abortions during the legal fight.",U.S./NBC News,Chief Justice John Roberts warns Supreme Court over Texas abortion law,https://news.yahoo.com/chief-justice-john-roberts-warns-193600545.html
12/11/2021,"ATLANTA (AP) — Days after announcing his candidacy for governor, Republican David Perdue further embraced debunked claims of electoral fraud in Georgia's 2020 presidential race by joining a lawsuit seeking to prove he and former President Donald Trump were cheated out of election victories. The suit claims that fraudulent or counterfeit ballots were counted in Fulton County, the state's most populous jurisdiction, although investigators rebutted the same claims previously. Perdue's lawsuit amplifies claims that the former senator has made this week since announcing a challenge to incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp on Monday. Perdue told Axios and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he wouldn't have certified Georgia's 2020 results if he had been governor then, unlike Kemp. Georgia law says the governor must certify results. Trump has repeatedly savaged Kemp for not doing enough to overturn the loss. After inviting Perdue to run, Trump endorsed Perdue on Monday, saying Kemp has been “very weak” on “election integrity."" The suit could further Perdue's effort to sew up the votes of Trump backers who believe the election was stolen as he tries to come back from his Senate election loss, saying that's how he'll unify the Republican Party and beat Kemp in the primary and then Democrat Stacey Abrams. His position that Georgia's 2020 election was wrongly decided isn't new. He called on Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to resign while votes were still being counted in 2020, saying he “failed to deliver honest and transparent elections,” said if he had been in the U.S. Senate on Jan. 6, he would have voted against accepting Georgia’s electoral votes. But until now he hadn't sued. “David Perdue is so concerned about election fraud that he waited a year to file a lawsuit that conveniently coincided with his disastrous campaign launch,” said Kemp spokesperson Cody Hall. “Keep in mind that lawsuit after lawsuit regarding the 2020 election was dismissed in part because Perdue declined to be listed as a plaintiff.” Fulton County voter Elizabeth Grace Lennon and Perdue are seeking to examine paper ballots and other ballot materials in Fulton County in the state court lawsuit, saying that will prove the fraud. The suit, however, does not seek to overturn the results of the election, in which Georgia gave its 16 electoral votes to Democratic President Joe Biden. “I want to use my position and legal standing to shine light on what I know were serious violations of Georgia law in the Fulton absentee ballot tabulation,” Perdue said in a statement released by lawyers. “We are asking a judge to consider the evidence after our forensic examination of the absentee ballots is completed and hold those persons responsible who engaged in this wrongful conduct.” Raffensperger said Perdue is “trying to curry favor with the Trump base by pushing election conspiracy theories” that Perdue doesn't actually believe. “This lawsuit recycles old claims that have already been refuted and is a waste of everyone’s time,” Raffensperger said in a statement. A spokesperson for Fulton County didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit is largely a repeat of one that Henry County Superior Court Judge Brian Amero dismissed in October after he ruled the plaintiffs, including longtime Georgia election systems critic Garland Favorito, hadn't alleged a “particularized injury” and thus didn't have standing to sue. Favorito and other plaintiffs are appealing that dismissal, even though they won the release of electronic ballot images. The new plaintiffs, who asked that the suit be assigned to Amero, say they have the standing to pursue claims that their state constitutional rights to equal protection and due process have been violated. Perdue claims his particularized injury was that he was a candidate for reelection in November but failed to achieve a majority, forcing him into a runoff with Democrat Jon Ossoff that Perdue lost. Lennon says she sought to cast an in-person early vote in October 2020 but was told someone had already submitted a mail ballot in her name. Raffensperger's office submitted a legal brief to Amero just before he dismissed the case, saying investigators found no evidence of fraudulent ballots. “Based upon the witness statements and examination of approximately 1,000 absentee ballots and ballot images, the secretary’s investigators have not uncovered any absentee ballots that match the descriptions given ... or otherwise appear to be fraudulent or counterfeit,” the legal brief said. The new lawsuit recounts claims that the investigators debunked, including claims by Susan Voyles and three other auditors that during a hand recount they saw “pristine” absentee ballots that appeared to have been marked by a computer and weren’t creased as if they had been put in envelopes. The investigators said they couldn't find any such ballots. The suit also renews debunked claims that election officials purposefully lied about stopping counting on election night, claiming that once observers left that election workers pulled out “suitcases” of ballots and counted the votes multiple times, effectively running up the score for Democrats. Secretary of State investigators said they found no evidence this had happened, either, saying video showed the suitcases were normal ballot bins brought out when election workers were told to keep counting. Investigators said workers told them ballot scanners jammed frequently, requiring workers to make multiple attempts to scan ballots. Investigators said scanner activity logs confirmed paper jams reported by workers and seen on video. The brief noted that former U.S. Attorney BJay Pak also concluded there was no evidence that workers counted hidden fradulent ballots based on statements made to the FBI and an independent review of the evidence. Seth Bringman, a spokesperson for Abrams said that ""while David Perdue conducts the conspiracy choir, Stacey will be focused on Georgians.” ___ Follow Jeff Amy at http://twitter.com/jeffamy.",Politics/Associated Press,"Georgia's Perdue sues over 2020 election, pushes fraud claim",https://news.yahoo.com/georgias-perdue-sues-over-2020-161224256.html
