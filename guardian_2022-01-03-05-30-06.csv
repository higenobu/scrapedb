1/3/2022,"Well, there goes the league title. Happy new year everyone! But hey, what a way to go. For the second time in two and half weeks Liverpool came to London and played out a wild, impossibly moreish 2-2 draw against occasionally brilliant, occasionally flawed opponents. This was no doubt an agonising watch for Jürgen Klopp in self‑isolation; just as it was 90 minutes of full-body torture for Thomas Tuchel, who spent the afternoon leaping up like a furious clockwork woodpecker, combination-punching invisible demons, and at one point hurling a bottle of orange energy drink thrillingly into an advertisement hoarding.  For Liverpool a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge follows the 2-2 draw at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. And so the ledger will report four points dropped: the kind of matches where title races are lost, seasons bookended. And yet it didn’t feel like a day for regrets. A five-month extended victory lap for the reigning champions presents a problem for the Premier League and its broadcast partners. It might well reopen the question of exactly how City have managed to build this extraordinary position of strength, a squad with no weaknesses. Some will point to questions the Premier League feel have yet to be answered over resources and expenditure, questions that are designed, at bottom, to preserve competitiveness. City’s fans might reply by rolling their eyes and pointing to Chelsea’s own absent £100m striker. One thing is clear. Flawed teams produce brilliant games. Those spaces, the mis-steps, it’s where the oxygen gets in. And this was a game where amazing things just kept happening. On 56 minutes Liverpool’s defence cleared a corner high into the night sky, Diogo Jota took the ball as it bounced, scrabbled back to his feet under pressure, and laid the bail off to Mohamed Salah. From 35 yards Salah produced something hilariously good, a driven chip-shot that drew, in turn, an outstanding stretching leaping save from Édouard Mendy. In that moment this didn’t feel like a football match, more a kind of display, a trick-shot bonus feature, Evel Knievel leaping a row of municipal buses. In reality the idea that this match represented a title race eliminator was always fanciful. Chelsea haven’t looked like contenders since the start of November. Liverpool had won six of their last eight, but will now be losing their first-choice attackers. And in the end, it’s not you: it’s them. It’s the unwavering excellence of Manchester City, a team that continues to make something very difficult look very easy indeed. Stamford Bridge was a noisy, gusty place at kick-off. With Romelu Lukaku at home watching Real Madrid, Thomas Tuchel went with that infamous “other system” also known as the shape that won Chelsea the Champions League: seven primarily defensive players, plus three in attack to press and cover. The early exchanges were hilariously error-prone, culminating in Trevoh Chalobah stooping to head clear Diogo Jota’s pass and ending up with his nose grazing the turf, somehow, in defiance of all physical laws, heading the ball off his own shoelaces. The ball broke to Sadio Mané. He buried it. If anything captures Liverpool’s edge of brittleness and brilliance it is the interaction between Trent Alexander-Arnold and Salah, arguably the outstanding single attacking combination in English football over the last decade. It was from there that Liverpool made it 2-0 with a startling moment of synchronised movement and passing physics. Salah started the move, funnelling the ball back to Alexander-Arnold. As Chelsea’s defenders slackened a little, Salah had already begun to sprint, sniffing out a sliver of space, a fault in the stitching. Alexander-Arnold released a wonderfully weighted, backspun pass straight into that same corridor. At which point Salah produced another perfect little miniature. His first touch stunned the ball into his stride. The second wasn’t a touch at all, but aa feint, an opening of the hips that transformed Marcos Alonso into a kind of goal-doorman, dipping a knee, scrolling his hand, formally inviting Salah into the Chelsea six-yard box. The finish was effortless, a lifted dink-prod on the run. Mateo Kovacic pulled one back with another stunner. Everyone who has ever kicked a ball has caught one like this just the once – leaning back, adjusting his feet, punting it up and then back down in a perfect parabola to clank in off the far post. But not, perhaps, in a brutally tight Premier League game in front of the watching millions, with just one shot, one moment to catch the sun. Chelsea’s equaliser moments later came down that same Liverpool right flank. Frankly, it all seemed a little too easy. Salah lost possession. Alexander-Arnold was caught dawdling in a half space. N’Golo Kanté was able to help the ball on for Christian Pulisic who conjured a fine finish of his own, arcing the ball over Caoimhin Kelleher with a perfectly lobbed instep touch. And the fact is neither of these teams is at the level of City, whose football has a kind of light around it right now, something clean and perfectly ordered, who have won 11 games in a row by passing and moving their opponents into a state of exhausted impotence. It would be absurd to denigrate a team this good for being, in effect too good, for winning games in a way that is so beautifully planned and drilled it seems to creep ever ever closer to a place where variables are removed, and the result is, in effect, inevitable. City are thing of beauty too. And on the ragged, thrilling evidence of Stamford Bridge, just too good for the rest.",Sport/Football,Glorious chaos at Stamford Bridge shows City are too good for the rest | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/02/glorious-chaos-at-stamford-bridge-shows-city-are-too-good-for-the-rest
1/3/2022,"Sport is politics. There is no question about that at the beginning of the year when the Winter Olympics are taking place in Beijing and the World Cup in Qatar. You only have to open the newspaper these days. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the Guardian, the Polish Gazeta Wyborcza and other quality media, which gather many voices to report on the world, deal on their sports pages with the diplomatic boycott of the Olympics by the USA, Great Britain and other countries, the “quiet diplomacy” of the International Olympic Committee and workers’ rights in Qatar. One news item received particular attention worldwide. Out of concern for the life of Peng Shuai, the former world No 1 in doubles, the WTA has suspended all tournaments in China. In total, about 30% of the WTA’s revenue comes from China, with the annual finals in Shenzhen paying out the equivalent of about €12m (£10m), more than any other event in women’s tennis. But the players are now saying: we’ll do without.  Taking a strong stance is a tradition in women’s tennis, whose history is marked by personalities. In the 1960s, the WTA founder and multiple grand slam winner Billie Jean King campaigned for equal treatment and pay for the genders. Later, the multiple Wimbledon winner Martina Navratilova campaigned for gay rights. The supposedly weaker sex actually dominates the fighting mode. Female athletes have turned their federation into an independent institution. The WTA’s consistent decisions send a signal: you can say no in sport. Negotiations require an interplay – approaching each other, but also withdrawing from time to time. Countries in which human rights are not universal also invest in football. These countries are part of global sport and offer so much money that many find it difficult to refuse. The German television broadcaster ZDF recently ran a hidden-camera investigation. The reporter spoke to workers from Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh who build stadiums and roads in Qatar. Eight of them lived in one room; they earn €300 a month each but have been waiting months for their salaries. The report also featured attractive match scenes from the 2021 Arab Cup and all eight new stadiums. In a country with 2.9 million inhabitants there are now eight of the most modern, expensive and beautiful stadiums in the world, less than an hour’s drive apart. The ZDF report was an anticipation of the dilemma facing the 2022 World Cup: people know about the situation in Qatar but they enjoy watching the spectacular pictures and the best teams. When the 1978 World Cup took place under the direction of the Argentinian military regime, many players had no answer to questions about human rights. Today, the world can no longer be viewed so naively. Everyone involved knows better than before about what is going on in faraway continents. Most footballers also have more time to deal with such issues, due to advanced professionalisation. Public figures like them are also expected to inform themselves of matters outside their bubble. Now that the world has become a village, everyone knows the conditions in Qatar. Some footballers are stepping in and calling for human rights to be respected. “I think more attention needs to be paid to this kind of thing in the future when awarding contracts,” the Germany international Leon Goretzka has said. Finland’s captain, Tim Sparv, wrote in an open letter: “We woke up too late, I woke up too late.” Sparv called on players, media and fans to talk about working conditions in Qatar. On a small scale, this argument is already bearing fruit. When a black player was racially insulted by a spectator during the third division match between MSV Duisburg and VfL Osnabrück in Germany in December, the teams forced a stop. All parties quickly agreed that they wanted to set an example: players, both clubs, referees, the association and fans from both camps. The individual is not powerless; people can make a difference. Small is where you start, big is where it can end. Greta Thunberg was 15 when she stood alone on a street in Stockholm to draw attention to climate change. Many joined in, and Fridays for Future has since put the environment on the global agenda. This has changed politics. Football too: the 2024 European Championship in Germany can be judged a success only if it takes ecological aspects into account. Our preparations are under way. I consider myself lucky to have been born into a democracy. It was not long ago that the conditions in my home country were different. Three decades ago Germany was divided, the eastern part a dictatorship. Other nations in Europe were also going through a change. The 1964 European Championship took place in a fascist state, and Spain’s team won its home tournament in front of General Franco. He was still in power when the 1982 World Cup was awarded to Spain. By the time it took place, Spain was a democracy. Major sporting events, especially in football, generate enormous attention. Nowadays, European Championships and World Cups require everyone who takes part to deal with working conditions and human rights. At Euro 2024 in Germany, too, Europe will negotiate with each other how we want to live together.  Philipp Lahm’s column appears regularly in the Guardian.

1/3/2022,"Good morning and happy new year! It’s nice to be back in your inbox and we hope you stayed safe and had a lovely festive season. The year is off to a tumultuous start with many states reporting record Covid infections and growing hospitalisations, compounded by concerns about the availability of tests. But there is some hope, with new studies indicating the Omicron variant currently spreading around the world is less severe than its predecessors. Australia recorded 32,000 new Covid cases on Sunday, and the positivity rate reached 20.3%, meaning one in five people tested had Covid. The figure is well above the 5% the WHO says is needed to keep the spread of Covid under control. So what does a 20% rate mean for Australia? Here’s our explainer. There were 1,066 people in hospital with Covid on Sunday – an 18% increase a day after the number had already doubled between Boxing Day and New Year’s Eve. The number of PCR tests in NSW dropped by almost 30,000 in 24 hours after the government encouraged people not to line up unless they had symptoms or were a close contact. Victoria’s health minister is expected to make an announcement in the coming days on widening access to rapid antigen tests after extreme heat caused the closure of eight of the state’s testing sites on Saturday, blowing out queues and test result wait times.  In some much-needed positive Covid news – there’s more research suggesting the Omicron variant is less severe than other variants. New studies suggest the variant is more likely to infect the throat than the lungs, which scientists believe may explain why it appears to be more infectious but less deadly than other versions of the virus. Some research has suggested that lateral flow tests detect Omicron better when the throat is swabbed rather than the nose. US politician Liz Cheney, a Republican member of the House committee investigating the attack on the US Capitol, says her party must choose between Donald Trump and the truth. “We can either be loyal to Donald Trump or we can be loyal to the constitution, but we cannot be both,” she told CBS’s Face the Nation. On Sunday, Cheney and Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the committee chairman, again discussed the possibility of a criminal referral for Trump over his failure to attempt to stop the riot or for his obstruction of the investigation. Our gut’s microbiome has a far greater effect on health than anyone previously imagined, according to emerging science, which is leading to stool transplants and designer gut bacteria. Researchers in Adelaide are harnessing the power of “super poo” in new treatments for the increasing number of people who are turning to faecal transplants for the health benefits. It was a horror weekend in the water across the country after three men and a seven-year-old boy died in separate drowning incidents. A number of people were also rescued from the water in other incidents, which has prompted authorities to plead with the public to take care while swimming and fishing. A whistleblower in Canada has warned that a progressive neurological illness that has baffled experts appears to be affecting a growing number of young people. Young adults with no prior health triggers are developing troubling symptoms, including rapid weight loss, insomnia, hallucinations and limited mobility. The Covid crisis has left Sri Lanka on the brink of bankruptcy and facing a deepening humanitarian crisis as inflation rises to record levels, food prices rocket and its coffers run dry. Half a million people have sunk into poverty since the pandemic struck, with rising costs forcing many to cut back on food. Russia is “very likely” to invade Ukraine and might only be deterred by “enormous sanctions”, the chair of the US House intelligence committee said on Sunday, adding an invasion could backfire on Moscow by drawing more countries into the Nato military alliance. Oxfam India has said its work in the country will be imperilled by the government’s refusal to renew a licence that permits it to receive funds from abroad. The last couple of years have surely reminded us that nobody can predict the future and nobody knows what’s coming around the corner. We can safely assume, however, that whatever troubles befall us, artists will struggle on, fighting the good fight, telling stories and taking us to places of imagination and illumination. As always, the new year offers a range of Australian films to look forward to. Hugo Weaving, Rose Byrne and Zac Efron star in some of 2022’s big movie releases, with directors George Miller, Ivan Sen, Baz Luhrmann and Gracie Otto at the helm. For Benjamin Giles, running 2,000km in 2021 was the first resolution he’d kept longer than two weeks. But it wasn’t easy – it took an app, a long lockdown and pushing through injury to reach his self-imposed target. But most of all, it took obsession. “I was way behind the schedule. But I was also obsessed, and it was mathematically possible that by running 11km a day for six weeks, with one rest day a week, I could reach my target on Christmas Eve.” Pruning is usually a technique applied to roses in winter, but more recently the gardening term has been cropping up whenever sociologists talk about our social lives. People have been pruning friends amid Covid – becoming “more insular and bonding-oriented”, and now many aren’t sure how to start rebuilding their social lives.

1/3/2022,"“Same old Sarries, always cheating,” came the chant from a Northampton supporter in the crowd. It is unclear whether he was moaning about the legality of some of their defensive work or perhaps making reference to how their salary cap scandal has been referenced a lot of late but he got one thing spot-on. This was without question the same old Saracens. The Northampton director of rugby, Chris Boyd, bristled at the idea that a win such as this for Saracens was inevitable when Northampton found themselves camped in their opponents’ 22 for large spells of the first half, only to go in at the interval at 6-6. We have seen it so many times before, however, that there was little surprising about the manner in which Saracens weathered the storm and with Alex Lozowski finishing with 20 points, pulled clear.  This sort of performance, particularly on their travels, has been the hallmark of Saracens’ return to the Premiership. They have the defensive resilience to soak up prolonged periods of pressure before edging in front and delivering the telling blow as their opponents get increasingly desperate. Here it was Lozowski’s try early in the second half and Tom Woolstencroft’s score from a driving maul that ensured victory for Saracens – Maro Itoje’s late effort making for a thoroughly demoralising afternoon for Northampton. It might have been different had Northampton managed to convert one of their chances in the first half – Boyd was adamant that repeatedly opting against kicking at goal was the right approach – and their supporters certainly felt that the referee Adam Leal ought to have shown a yellow card following a flurry of Saracens penalties. He did not, however, and after Northampton again opted for a scrum under the posts he penalised the home side – much to Boyd’s frustration. Boyd said: “He didn’t have enough nuts did he? I mean it was a clear hinge. There was only one side under pressure in that series of scrums. At the end of the day we only got six points and they got 30. We had half a dozen opportunities in the first half, they had three and scored three tries. That’s the difference between the two sides.” Northampton can regroup, at least safe in the knowledge that they are not the only side to suffer this kind of defeat at the hands of Saracens. Bristol were also kept tryless at home back in September but they probably ought to have played the conditions better. They were not without positives – George Furbank was excellent at fullback – but just as was the case last time out against Harlequins at Twickenham, a touch more pragmatism could make all the difference when the heavens open. Saracens, meanwhile, have cemented their grip on second spot. Jamie George made a successful return to the side from a knee injury – perhaps his most valuable asset was the manner in which he communicated with Leal when his side were under the pump – and Alex Goode again showed his class at fly-half, standing in for the injured Owen Farrell, who was in the coaches’ box, barking out instructions to his side. In a further boost for club and country, the Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall revealed Farrell could make his comeback on 23 January, two weeks before England’s Six Nations opener. Lozowski and Biggar traded a pair of penalties in a first half notable for Northampton’s ambition despite the torrential rain and Saracens’ ability to hold firm in the trenches. Furbank in particular was a threat with the ball in hand, but Saracens were resilient with their backs to the wall. Given Saracens reached double figures in penalties against inside the first half, however, maybe Northampton’s grievances were not without foundation. Saracens then struck with the first try four minutes after the restart. Goode was the architect, straightening through half a gap before offloading to Lozowski, who slid for the line early and had just enough momentum to get there. He converted for good measure for a seven-point lead. There was no little endeavour from Northampton but as the half wore on there was increasingly an inevitability to the Woolstencroft try that broke Saints’ spirit. It occurred moments after the Saints replacement Conor Clarey had been sent to the sin-bin and before Itoje splashed over for good measure. “When you’re under the pump, in front of a great crowd as Northampton have, in your 22 as often as we were you need your senior players to step up and I thought across the board ours did,” McCall said. “I thought we showed a lot of fight, grit and resolve. Just a really good hard fought away win.”",Sport/Sport,Tom Woolstencroft breaks Saints’ spirit for resilient Saracens,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/02/northampton-saracens-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
