4/27/2022,"Queer Eye’s Tan France is one of the most uplifting personalities on television. This great documentary explores his battle with colourism while growing up in Doncaster. Unsurprisingly, his sweet nature brings out some candid moments in interviews with others who have faced this, including Kelly Rowland, Bunmi Mojekwu and a class of teenagers. France then attempts to head home to Yorkshire to face up to the shame that led him to bleach his skin when he was a boy.

4/27/2022,"Billionaire Clive Palmer’s proposal to build an open-cut coalmine 10km from the coast of the Great Barrier Reef would have a “far-reaching impact” on the world heritage area, say scientists, whose modelling shows concentrated pollution from the mine could reach sensitive marine ecosystems within weeks. The Queensland government last year deemed the Central Queensland coal proposal by a subsidiary company of Palmer’s flagship entity, Mineralogy, “not suitable” and said it posed “a number of unacceptable risks” due to its location, the prospect of polluted water discharge and a lack of effective mitigation measures. Despite the state government’s rejection, the project remains viable and is on the desk of the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, awaiting a determination. A new study, published in the journal Marine Pollution Bulletin by scientists at the Université Catholique de Louvain in Belgium and James Cook University in Townsville, sought to model the dispersal of sediment and derive their potential impact on marine ecosystems. The study found that, within a few weeks, intense tidal currents could transport finer sediments more than 35km from the Styx River and into areas of the marine park, including dense seagrass meadows and a dugong sanctuary. “Our study suggests that the proposed … open-cut coalmine could have a profound and far-reaching impact on some iconic species and ecosystems of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area,” the study found. “We also showed that sediment transport and dispersion in Broad Sound is not an isotropic process that would uniformly spread sediments throughout the bay and hence quickly reduce their concentration. “Instead, sediments are mostly transported in the western part of the bay, where they overlapped with ecologically sensitive regions such as areas of a high predicted probability of seagrass, the Clairview dugong sanctuary, and turtle nesting beaches on Avoid Island.” The study said the loss of seagrass meadows had already been observed around Australia and that species like dugongs and turtles were already threatened as a result. The study follows a 2020 report from the national Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development (IESC) had raised “extreme concern” about the potential for ecological damage from the project in particular the release of “mine-affected water”. The extent of the risk posed by the potential discharges, however, has not previously been revealed. The authors of the report have called for the mine’s environmental impact assessment – currently being assessed by Ley – to include downstream and “broader cumulative” impacts. Attempts have been made to contact the proponent for comment. Dr Lissa Schindler, the Great Barrier Reef campaign manager for the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the research provides evidence that approving the mine would post too much risk to the world heritage area. “This research confirms that the Queensland Government’s EIS assessment released in late April 2021 was correct in saying the mine is ‘not suitable to proceed’ on environmental grounds,” Schindler said. “It also backs the conclusions of expert scientists appointed by the federal Government who warned in early 2021 they could not envisage any mitigation measures by that could safeguard nearby environments.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Schindler said Ley should have rejected the application 12 months ago. “As we near the election, we call on all parties to follow the scientific advice, including from the federal government’s own independent scientific expert panel, and reject this mine. “Approving a mine that will only add to the heating stress and water pollution on our reef would be an astonishingly bad decision for any government which wants to protect our global icon.”",News/Australia news,"Clive Palmer’s proposed open-cut mine could have ‘far-reaching impact’ on Great Barrier Reef, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/27/clive-palmers-proposed-open-cut-mine-could-have-far-reaching-impact-on-great-barrier-reef-study-finds
4/27/2022,"Halfway through The Offer, a new Paramount+ limited series on the making of The Godfather, the film’s sole producer, Al Ruddy (Miles Teller), has a surprise meeting with two FBI agents. Such shadowy encounters are, as this patchy and self-indulgent ten-part story reveals, par for the course on a production knotted with complications and controversy. These obstacles are, of course, surmounted; the producer quickly charms the FBI agents investigating Ruddy’s budding friendship with New York mob boss Joe Colombo (Giovanni Ribisi, in full ham mode). When one asks why Ruddy left Hogan’s Heroes, the hit sitcom he co-created, to work in the movies, he replies: “TV is too limiting. You can’t tell real stories on TV. It’s fake. And Marlon Brando does not do TV.” I had to laugh. Here I am, watching 10ish hours of a Paramount+ show about one of Paramount Pictures’ greatest triumphs – a limited series given too-few limits. It’s television, these days, where one could tell a story like this: meta, sprawling, populated with a who’s who of character actors, overlong. (To be fair, it is very in the spirit of The Godfather to go long on time and spare few whims.) The Offer, created by Michael Tolkin, is ostensibly the true story behind the making of the 1972 classic – I’m not here to dispute the Godfather’s legacy – but the show often feels more like a fantasy of male doggedness or Wikipedia article come to life than behind-the-scenes account. Take a scene in the fourth episode in which Ruddy and his wily assistant Bettye McCartt (Juno Temple, in a similar role to her spunky ballbuster turn on Ted Lasso) are locking down tricky negotiations for The Godfather. “When I started working for you, I really wasn’t sure that you knew what you were doing,” she tells him. “Well, let me tell you. You’re doing something important. That’s why I don’t mind trading in a love life for reading Godfather rewrites. You just fucking swing, and that matters.” That could probably double as a thesis statement for the series, which despite dozens of characters and several registers – work porn procedural, crime drama, character comedy and Hollywood paean – is ultimately about Ruddy’s heroic persistence as producer. The main plot of The Offer cycles like this: there’s an obstacle to making the Godfather, be it casting Pacino, Frank Sinatra denouncing the project or the mob wanting a cut. Ruddy, a restless former office pencil pusher, and his team – Bettye, The Godfather novelist Mario Puzo (Patrick Gallo) and writer/director Francis Ford Coppola (a particularly convincing Dan Fogler) – out-maneuver and negotiate their way through said roadblocks. This is either in collaboration with or at the expense of Ruddy’s higher-ups: swaggering Paramount boss Bob Evans (Matthew Goode), mercurial studio owner Charlie Bluhdorn (Burn Gorman) and his feckless Gulf and Western executive Barry Lapidus (Colin Hanks). There are a lot of phone calls, conference rooms and cross-country flights. The Godfather show, despite seemingly all odds, goes on. At its best, the series manages to both take the stranger-than-fiction production of a genuinely groundbreaking movie seriously while also lightly mocking the self-seriousness of Hollywood storytellers and actual mobsters. Unfortunately, that balance falters too often. The Offer’s first episode opens at a mob boss dinner in Little Italy, and its first four conclude with a cliff-hanger involving Mafia violence. The Offer occasionally works as a meta-depiction of Hollywood lore, but not as a television show about the type of people in The Godfather. Violent scenes in which real-life criminals torment and interrogate and kill feel like the thing The Godfather team insisted they were avoiding: a rote Mafia flick. Time and again, The Offer, like Ruddy, seems to have bit off more than it can chew. Colombo and his ilk, who feel insulted by the movie, at first seem pathetic and petty; Ruddy’s friendship with Colombo seems to be for show. Yet The Offer softens on both over time, playing Ruddy’s cozying up to mobsters (Colombo kidnaps and threatens a man into loaning his Staten Island house for the Corleone estate, for example) as simply necessary for the movie. With the exception of Bettye, the women – Ruddy’s first wife Francoise (Nora Arnezeder) and Evans’s wife Ali MacGraw (Meredith Garretson) mostly serve as icons of their partners’ career obsessions without much understanding of why they’re in the relationship in the first place. Still, there are some bright spots. Goode is delightful as the charismatic, unstable Evans. Anthony Ippolito’s embodiment of a young and hungry Al Pacino is uncanny; the same cannot be said of Justin Chambers’ Marlon Brando whisper or Frank John Hughes’s portrayal of an aggressive, petty Frank Sinatra, both of which strain against the weight of iconography. And inside baseball can be fun – somehow the farther up Paramount Pictures’ ass this Paramount+ show goes, the more interesting it is. Teller is the kind of actor you want to watch throw some elbows to get things done, even if his faux gravelly voice slips in more intimate scenes. All criticisms – and there are many – aside, the Offer remains watchable to the bloated end. It may not be the hard-won prestige of The Godfather, but in this over-saturated landscape content, that is its own form of achievement.

4/27/2022,"The Olympic gold medallist Emily Seebohm has slammed rightwing lobby group Advance for using her image without permission on a transphobic billboard. The billboards display the words “women’s sport is not for men” alongside images of swimmers Dawn Fraser, Emma McKeon and Seebohm and were launched as part of an attack on the Warringah MP, Zali Steggall, who has been vocal in her support for trans women to compete in female sports. Both Fraser and Seebohm have publicly stated they are furious their photos have been associated with the campaign. Guardian Australia has attempted to contact McKeon, and does not suggest any of them endorse the ads or the use of their image in any way. The images were seen on a truck driving around the electorate over the weekend. Appearing on The Project on Tuesday night, Seebohm said her image had been used without her permission. “I have no idea who Advance Australia is but … I don’t want my photo next to something saying transphobic,” Seebohm said. “That is a statement that I’ve never said and I don’t suggest nor support that and ... the photo is just horrific! So the whole thing is just awful to me.” The Australian Olympic Committee and Swimming Australia have threatened legal action over the billboards, alleging they are using its intellectual property without permission – as the athletes appear in their Olympic swimsuits. Seebohm previously told Sky News that “biological males are always going to be stronger, fitter, faster than biological females” and that swimming bodies needed “to work out how we can all come together in this sport”. On Tuesday night Seebohm said her comments were taken out of context and that she believes sport is for everyone. “I’ve not once said that I don’t want inclusivity in this sport. I want everyone to feel included in this sport, we just have to work out how that works and how this will look,” she said. “Whether it is a female race, a male race and a transgender race we just don’t know yet, that’s something that needs to be discussed and we need to work out how to do that so everyone feels safe and supported and the competition is fair at the end of the day.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Seebohm said there was a difference between community and top-level sport and both required different approaches. On Monday Nine newspapers reported that Fraser had engaged her own solicitor over the billboards, and did not support her image being used. The Swimming Australia chief executive, Eugenie Buckley, said the organisation condemned the use of the billboards. “Swimming Australia strongly condemns the use of imagery of our athletes, past and present, by the Advance Australia party in recent political advertising,” Buckley said. Buckley said if Advance had asked for permission to use the images, it would have been been denied. “Swimming Australia believes in a competitive environment that is inclusive, fair and equitable for all athletes at the same time. Ultimately, all Australians deserve to feel welcome, safe, valued and celebrated in swimming.” Advance supports the Liberal Warringah candidate, Katherine Deves, whose comments on trans people have been widely condemned. The lobby group is calling for people to protest vote against her detractors, including those within her own party. Advance has also run truck advertisements depicting the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, along with a ballot reading “Labor 1” alongside the words “CCP SAYS VOTE Labor”.

4/27/2022,"The New Zealand government has released new plans to try to prepare the country for the catastrophic effects of the climate crisis: sea level rise, floods, massive storms and wildfires. The proposals, released for consultation on Wednesday, outline sweeping reforms to institutions, councils and laws to try to stop people building in hazardous areas, preserve cultural treasures, improve disaster responses, protect the financial system from the shocks of future disasters, and reform key industries including tourism, fisheries and farming. “The climate is already changing and there will be some effects we cannot avoid,” climate change minister James Shaw said. “Just in the last few months we have seen massive floods, such as those in Tairawhiti; storms, such as those experienced recently in Westport; fires in the Waituna wetlands in Southland; and droughts right across the country.” “These events demonstrate the case for urgent action on climate change – action to protect lives, incomes, homes, businesses and infrastructure.” Over the last year, some New Zealand communities have been repeatedly hit by devastating flooding. In March, Tairawhiti was hit with its second destructive flood in less than a year. Flood waters damaged homes, schools and infrastructure, with residents saying it would “take about a year to clean up”. Last year, flooding in Westport left 450 homes unliveable or damaged. At the forefront of the plan is the challenge of how to adapt New Zealand’s cities and housing stock – much of which is coastal – to the risk of rising seas and flood waters. According to the government, the scale of the problem is enormous: 675,000 people – one in seven New Zealanders – live in areas prone to flooding, amounting to nearly $100bn worth of residential buildings. Another 72,065 live in areas projected to be subject to extreme sea level rise. “The number of people exposed to these hazards will increase as the climate changes,” the report says. It found that between 2007 and 2017, the contribution of climate change to floods and droughts alone cost New Zealanders an estimated $840m in insured damages and economic losses. Those figures present a huge, looming problem for homeowners, who face losing their ability to insure their homes as the risk level rises, and for local and central government, which have been met with furious revolt by some communities when trying to shift them away from hazards. The government’s proposed changes, include updating the building code to make sure new builds account for climate hazards, ensuring the country’s public housing stock is built away from hazards, creating incentives for development away from high-risk areas and making it compulsory to disclose information about climate risks to prospective buyers and builders. Some of those measures are likely to cause unease for homeowners, who are worried that climate risk assessments could tank the value of their homes. Shaw was clear that the government would not be picking up the bill for all such changes. “Central government does not bear all the costs,” he said. “The consultation asks how best to share risks and costs between property and asset owners, insurers, banks and local government as well.” The draft National Adaptation Plan outlines the actions the government will take over the next six years to respond to climate-related risks. It also includes proposals for protecting important cultural sites, such as coastal marae [māori meeting houses], and to adapt government-funded infrastructure to take climatic heating into account. It also covers proposed reforms of the tourism sector to ensure international visitors “contribute to resilient, adaptable infrastructure and the natural environment they use” – possibly through an arrival fee or other taxes on tourists. Prof Bronwyn Hayward, of University of Canterbury, said via the Science Media Centre that the plan “shows the enormity of the task facing the government after years of inaction”. “We now need to implement climate planning guidelines across a raft of new legislation, and we need to think carefully about how people are exposed to repeated flooding effects – and I’d add fires – in the future. If homeowners, businesses, schools, ports or airports have to move away from a high-risk area for example, who pays?” Prof Anita Wreford, of Lincoln University, said that the plan was “well overdue” and “an improvement from New Zealand’s current approach to hazards, which has been very reactive and focused on recovery after an event”. But she said the proposals were still very high level, and needed to provide “much more guidance for decision-makers”. “I suspect groups waiting in anticipation for this … may have hoped for more concrete direction in implementing adaptation to achieve these goals.” The plan will be open for public consultation before the proposals are finalised by the government. “Aotearoa will soon have a plan to bring down our emissions and help prevent the worst effects of climate change,” Shaw said, “But we must also support communities already being hit by more extreme and more frequent weather events.”",News/World news,New Zealand unveils plan to tackle climate crisis by adapting cities to survive rising seas,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/27/new-zealand-unveils-plan-to-tackle-climate-crisis-by-adapting-cities-to-survive-rising-seas
4/27/2022,"Drama students will have the opportunity to study a more diverse curriculum at GCSE and A-level with the addition of four new plays by writers of colour. AQA, the biggest examination board in England, says the texts are part of a range of measures to update and revise its qualifications to ensure they better reflect the diversity of students and their teachers. The new plays at GCSE level will include a thriller by Francis Turnly which is based on the true story of Japanese citizens who were abducted by the North Korean regime in the 1970s and 80s. The Empress by Tanika Gupta, which tells the story of Queen Victoria’s relationship with her servant Abdul Karim and an Indian nanny called Rani Das, will also be added to the GCSE curriculum. The new A-level texts include a reworking of Chekhov’s Three sisters by Inua Ellams, located in 1960s Nigeria, and Danai Gurira’s The Convert, which tells the story of a young Shona girl who flees an arranged marriage by converting to Christianity. The exam board’s GCSE drama qualification already includes the well-known stage adaptation of Malorie Blackman’s Noughts and Crosses, which reverses traditional racial stereotypes and shows racial prejudice from a different perspective. The texts will be available to study from September, with examinations taking place two years later. AQA is scheduling free online training events to give teachers a practical toolkit to prepare for and teach the new texts. The exam board will also provide information about the social and historical backgrounds of each text, and cover topics such as stereotypes, accents and casting. It will also look at how to teach texts currently on the curriculum, with a focus on equality, diversity and inclusion. Sandra Allan, AQA’s head of curriculum for creative arts, said: “We’ve chosen these plays because of the rich opportunities they’ll offer our teachers and students to explore a diverse range of themes including race and social issues. “However, we know that just adding new plays won’t bring about greater diversity in the curriculum by itself, so we can’t stop there. We need to make it as easy as possible for schools to start teaching these plays. “That’s why we’re providing lots of new support and resources and we really hope teachers and students will enjoy these new additions to our drama qualifications.” AQA is not alone in updating its curriculum. Last year the OCR exam board introduced a range of new works including the 2019 Booker prize-winning novel Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo to its GCSE and A-level English literature courses. If follows criticism that the curriculum in England is not sufficiently inclusive and needs to adapt to better reflect modern society. Research by the education charity Teach First, published in 2020, found that pupils could complete their GCSEs and leave secondary school in England without studying a novel or play by a non-white author. The Great Wave by Francis Turnly shines a spotlight on the abduction by North Korea of young Japanese citizens. Spanning 1979 to 2003, the play covers the mysterious disappearance of 17-year-old Japanese schoolgirl Hanako. It echoes the real life experience of Megumi Yokota, who was just 13 when she was abducted by a North Korean agent in 1977. The Empress by Tanika Gupta begins in 1887 when Rani Das and Abdul Karim arrive at London’s Tilbury Docks from India. The play covers the true story of Queen Victoria’s relationship with her servant and Hindi teacher, Karim, as well as the experiences of Indian ayahs like Das who came to Britain during the 19th century and were treated like second-class citizens. The Convert by Danai Gurira is the story of a young Shona girl called Jekesai who escapes an arranged marriage by converting to Christianity and becoming a servant and student to an African Evangelical. Inspired by George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion, the play by the American-Zimbabwean dramatist considers questions of racial, political and religious identity and assimilation, exploring the cultural and religious collisions caused by British colonialism. Three Sisters by Inua Ellams sees Chekhov’s iconic characters relocated from provincial Russia to 1960s Owerri in Nigeria where the country is on the brink of the Nigerian civil war, a conflict which saw the eastern region of Nigeria temporarily declared a new republic called Biafra. The Guardian’s Michael Billington described the play as a “startlingly vivid account of the civil war and a direct assault on British neocolonialism”.",News/Education,Exam board adds new plays by writers of colour to drama GCSE and A-Level,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/27/exam-board-adds-new-plays-writers-of-colour-drama-gcse-a-level
4/27/2022,"Women with asthma are twice as likely to die from an asthma attack compared with men in the UK, new figures show as health experts called for urgent research into the condition’s sex-related differences. They are more likely to have the condition, more likely to need hospital treatment for it and more likely to die from an attack, Asthma + Lung UK said. Over the past five years women have accounted for more than two-thirds of asthma deaths in the UK. The charity said the current “one size fits all” approach to asthma treatment is “not working” because it does not take into account the impact that female sex hormones during puberty, periods, pregnancy and menopause can have on asthma symptoms and attacks. More must be done to tackle the “stark health inequality”, it added. In childhood, asthma is more prevalent and severe in boys. However, after puberty the situation completely reverses, Asthma + Lung UK said. Between 2014-15 and 2019-20 more than 5,100 women in the UK died from an asthma attack compared with fewer than 2,300 men. Meanwhile, emergency hospital admissions in England show that, among those aged 20 to 49, women were 2.5 times more likely to be admitted to hospital for asthma treatment compared with men. Asthma + Lung UK said many people were unaware that fluctuations in female sex hormones can cause asthma symptoms to flare up or even trigger life-threatening attacks. It is calling for more research to examine the sex-related differences in asthma. Poppy Hadkinson, 30, a TV presenter from Stratford-upon-Avon, said her asthma worsened when she went through puberty. “I was diagnosed with asthma aged 11, which looking back on it was when I was right in the middle of going through puberty,” she said. “Over the next decade, I had regular asthma attacks and would end up in hospital up to six times a year. “There seemed to be a pattern to my symptoms, linked to my menstrual cycle. Nearly every month in the run up to my period, I’d be really ill with my asthma. My symptoms would leave me struggling to breathe, which was terrifying, and I’d often end up in hospital. “The asthma attacks I suffered were so severe that I’d been ventilated four times by the time I was 22 and was questioning whether I’d make it to my next birthday.” She later began using a biologic drug, omalizumab, which has been a “life-changer”. “We need to better understand how asthma affects women so we can find treatments that will give women like me their lives back,” she said. Asthma + Lung UK is encouraging GPs to explore potential triggers with their patients and create tailored adjustments to a patient’s medication regimen. Women are also being encouraged to take their preventer medication as prescribed, ensure they attend their annual asthma review, and to keep a symptom diary that could help identify triggers. The Asthma + Lung UK chief executive, Sarah Woolnough, said: “When it comes to research funding, women with asthma have drawn the short straw. Gaps in our knowledge are failing women, leaving them struggling with debilitating asthma symptoms, stuck in a cycle of being in and out of hospital and, in some cases, losing their lives. “By understanding the role of sex hormones in asthma, we could transform the lives of the 3 million women with the condition in the UK and the many millions of women with asthma across the world. We urgently need to see more investment in research in this area so we can find new treatments and better use existing treatments to help millions of women and save lives.”",News/Society,Asthma research disadvantages women by disregarding sex hormones,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/27/asthma-research-disadvantages-women-by-disregarding-sex-hormones

Within minutes transatlantic telephone cables started sequentially snapping, with the furthest cable – 600km from the quake – breaking 13 hours and 17 minutes later. At the time geologists hypothesised that the cables had been broken by a series of earthquakes, but we now know that the culprit was a massive underwater avalanche, known as a “turbidity current”. These gravity-driven currents are a key way of transporting sediment to the deep sea with the largest able to carry more sediment than the annual output of all the world’s rivers combined. Their deposits, or “turbidites”, can be hundreds or even thousands of metres thick and were assumed to be dumped in a single event, until a new model, described in Science Advances, showed that in fact it happens in many episodes. The finding will help geologists better identify ancient turbidite deposits (which sometimes contain gold, or oil and gas), and understand modern-day turbidity currents, which as well as transporting sediment to the oceans’ abyssal plains, can deliver plastic litter and other pollutants to the deep sea.",News/Science,Massive underwater avalanches deliver pollutants to deep sea,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/27/massive-underwater-avalanches-deliver-pollutants-to-deep-sea
4/27/2022,"There is a crime wave on our streets, being committed by insouciant teens, commuting executives and even pensioners. Gleefully they glide across our inner cities, scarcely breaking a sweat as they overtake cyclists on stiff climbs. They descend with ease, hair whipping in the wind, gravity and electric engine working together to deliver them to their destination at sometimes staggering speeds. There are hundreds of thousands of these lawbreakers in the country today. They flout the law openly. You will have seen them in cycle lanes, main roads and even on the pavements. Perhaps you’ve almost been knocked over by one yourself. London, Hampshire, the West Midlands and Sussex appear to be particular hotspots. They’re the e-scooter riders of the UK, and they have already come to a street near you. Despite it being illegal to ride a private e-scooter anywhere in the UK that is not private land, use has soared in recent years, with 1m private e-scooters imported into the UK since 2018, and about 750,000 believed to be in use. “The illegal e-scooters are demonstrating a clear unmet transport need,” says Lorna Stevenson, an e-scooter researcher at the University of Westminster. “There are people using them who won’t know they’re illegal, but others who do, and still see it as worth the risk. The question is, what is the rest of the transport system not providing to these people?” Most private e-scooters are set to a limit of 30km/h (19mph), although some can go up to 60km/h. Cheaper models will set you back less than £100, although if you want to travel more than a couple of miles, you are looking at more like £300 or £400. They are sold by major retailers including Argos and Currys, with disclaimers against illegal use that are routinely ignored. “Pretty much everyone agrees,” says Lorna Stevenson, “that the current situation is bad. The fact that it’s legal to walk into a shop and buy an e-scooter, but not to ride it on the road, is a mess for all concerned.” “I feel like there’s nothing wrong with e-scooters if they’re using them safely,” says Al, 35, a marketer and private e-scooter user from south-east London. Al bought his £270 e-scooter in December 2021. He is immunocompromised, and has spent much of the past two years shielding. With his e-scooter, he’s able to travel across the city without fear of maskless commuters. (He says that he’s unable to ride a bike, for medical reasons.) He insists that he’s a responsible user, only using it in cycle lanes, never pavements, and avoiding rush-hour traffic, so as not to clog up the roads. “I hate it when I see people whizzing through buses,” Al says. “It’s like: ‘You’re making all of us look bad.’ I know it’s exciting and fun, but calm down.’” But Al has already fallen foul of the law: in March this year, British Transport Police confiscated the scooter. “I was right in front of my house,” Al sighs. He had to pay £160 to get it back from an impound lot, and then fix it, because it had been damaged in transit. Al is Black; research from the zero-carbon campaign group Possible in 2021 found that Black Londoners are more than three times more likely to be stopped for e-scooters offences than white Londoners. Despite his brush with the law, Al intends to keep using his e-scooter. “I need it,” he says. “I’m sorry if it’s against the law.” There are legal ways to experience the e-scooter thrill. Since 2020, rental e-scooter trials have been operational in many parts of the UK, run by companies including Lime, Spin, Dott, Tier and Voi, in partnership with local authorities. These devices are capped at a maximum speed of 15.5mph, and users must have a full or provisional driving licence. Helmet-wearing is strongly advised, although not mandatory. The Department for Transport is monitoring these trials, which have been extended to later this year, and will use the data collected to determine whether e-scooters should be legalised. I try one of these rental schemes for myself on the streets of Southwark, south London. Downloading the Lime app and scanning my ID is straightforward: the app takes me through a lighthearted quiz (should I wear helmets only on bad hair days, or all the time?) before I’m able to unlock the e-scooter and move it from the stand. It’s cumbersome and fairly heavy to wheel, and it takes me a minute to get the hang of it – you need to kick away and freewheel before you can start the engine. Gathering speed, I look from side to side and then, quietly as I can, I mutter: “Vroom. Vroom vroom.” It’s fun. After my brief jaunt, I’m a fan. Were e-scooters available in my area of London (they aren’t currently), I could certainly see myself using one to get around. I’m not alone: canvassing e-scooter users participating in trials around the UK for this article, many are evangelical about their promise. “They’re incredibly easy to use,” says Joe Rayment, a 30-year-old bid writer. “You just push off and hold a button and you’re away.” Rayment lives in Bristol, which is hilly. “I’m not super-fit,” he admits, “so cycling is difficult. But on an e-scooter you can whip up a hill really easily.” Rayment uses rental e-scooters to replace journeys that he would previously have taken by car. “If I’m going out for an evening,” he says, “to visit a friend on the other side of the city, whereas I might have got a cab both ways before, I’ll get a scooter there and back now.” This is arguably the great promise of e-scooters and other electric micro-mobility devices, such as e-bikes: that they can replace fossil-fuel-powered models of transportation. “This is an exciting mode of transport that has the ability to get people out of cars,” says Hal Stevenson of Lime, “where previously bikes weren’t so attractive.” The key issue is what forms of transport the e-scooters are replacing. If e-scooters are pulling people out of cars, they’re more sustainable, but if people are using e-scooters for journeys they might have walked, or cycled, they’re a net loss, because manufacturing e-scooters is a resource-intensive endeavour. “We need to move away from fossil fuels,” says John Broderick of the Royal Society of Chemistry. “All types of electric vehicles are more efficient than combustion engines. But it requires a lot of material resources to make the lithium-ion batteries. Plus, there’s no infrastructure in place in the UK to effectively recycle them, meaning that some scooter batteries may go to landfill.” Lime estimates that, globally, one in four trips taken by its users replaces a car journey. A Swiss research paper, published in December, found that privately owned e-scooters tended to replace car journeys, but rented e-scooters emitted more CO2 than the transport modes they replaced. “They’re not a silver bullet,” admits Hal Stevenson. “But they are a tool to help get people out of cars, and create more sustainable transport solutions.” It all comes down to best usage, says Broderick. “If they’re being bought as toys, and people aren’t getting a lot of mileage out of them, then they’ll have a high profile in terms of their environmental impact,” he says. “But if you’re using them for five or six years and they’re replacing a car, that’s great.” Sustainability is probably a secondary consideration for many e-scooter users. More than anything, e-scooters are great fun, as I learned for myself on the streets of Southwark. “It’s a good laugh riding them,” says Jonathan Thompson, a 52-year-old healthcare worker from Middlesbrough, who is a regular rental e-scooter user. “When you get on a straight stretch there’s this nice flying feeling.” But for all their acolytes, it is almost as easy to find detractors. In part, this is because reckless users are so visible. “They’re always on the pavement,” says Pritpal Kaur, a 71-year-old airport worker from west London. “They don’t seem to care. They think they own the pavement.” Kaur was almost knocked down by an e-scooter on the pavement – at the last minute, her daughter pulled her out of the way. Like Kaur, I’ve also almost been hit by an e-scooter on the pavement. The rider, a teenager, came so close, I felt a rush of air as he swerved around me. But it seems unfair to vilify all e-scooter riders due to the rule-breaking of a few: after all, 56% of car drivers exceed the speed limit in low-speed areas. I suspect this hatred is fuelled by a larger animus among motor vehicle users towards people they perceive to be clogging up the roads. “Some people really don’t like e-scooters, in the same way that some people don’t like cyclists,” says Lorna Stevenson. “They are perceived to be ‘other’, or doing something that is not normal. Why won’t they just get a car? But others have valid reasons for not liking them.” For people with disabilities, particularly the visually impaired, e-scooters, which are mostly silent, can affect their ability to use public spaces. It is for this reason that Guide Dogs UK has spoken out against legalising e-scooters, while the Royal National Institute of Blind People has called for a range of measures including safe parking, road use only and enforcement against pavement users. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Salford are developing a universal sound for e-scooters. (The Lime e-scooter I used made a low-pitched whirr, but the private e-scooters that zipped past me were noiseless.) “They come up behind you and you can’t hear them,” says Elaine Maries, who is 54 and lives in Milton Keynes. Maries, who is visually impaired, has been knocked over twice by e-scooters. The first time, in May 2021, happened just as Maries and her guide dog, Inca, stepped outside their house. “Two young people hit me and I fell over on Inca,” Maries says. A passerby told Maries they were e-scooter users, who fled the scene. Maries was bruised, and Inca pulled a muscle in her leg that put her out of action for six weeks, rendering Maries housebound. Two months later, Maries tripped over two e-scooters on a pavement and fractured her foot. “What people don’t realise,” says Maries, “is when something like this happens, that’s my complete independence gone.” Maries was unlucky. You are much more likely to be injured by a car than an e-scooter. In the year to June 2021, there were 882 accidents involving e-scooters, and three deaths, but all of these deaths were of e-scooter users, rather than pedestrians. The first e-scooter death reported on UK roads was of the YouTuber and TV presenter Emily Hartridge, who died after colliding with a lorry in July 2019. An inquest concluded that Hartridge had lost control of the scooter in part due to an underinflated tyre. In January this year, a 74-year-old male e-scooter rider died, while in March, a 14-year-old girl riding an e-scooter died after a crash involving a van. These deaths attracted national media attention due to the novelty of e-scooters, but it’s worth putting them into context: about four people die each day on our roads, and these deaths pass largely unnoticed, while newspapers fulminate about the “e-scooter menace” on our streets. “Our feelings of safety are not always rational,” says Lorna Stevenson. “There are people out there with strongly negative feelings about e-scooters, and it’s important we don’t minimise those concerns, especially when those people may already be transport-disadvantaged due to age or disability.” But there is some evidence to suggest that e-scooters may be more dangerous than comparable forms of transport, such as bicycles. One factor is their speed. “My concern is how easily they can be tampered with,” says Margaret Winchcomb of the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety, which recently published a report into e-scooter safety. “The scooters may be sold with a capped speed, but we’ve heard these designs can be altered to go up to speeds of 60mph.” By contrast, professional cyclists struggle to achieve speeds of more than 30mph, and the average urban cyclist rides well below 20mph. “It’s basic physics,” says Winchcomb. “The faster you’re going when you hit a solid object, the more energy is released. Fundamentally, our bodies can’t cope with that.” The design of e-scooters may also make them unstable. “Because they have smaller wheels,” says Winchcomb, “they are more susceptible to defects in the road surfaces. They can’t navigate potholes so easily.” A study from University of California researchers in April found that e-scooters had injury rates more akin to motorcycles than bicycles. I’m not surprised to find this: although my Lime e-scooter was capped at a speed of 12.5mph – which is by no means fast, so that I was easily overtaken by cyclists – when I hit a pothole, I nearly fell off. The e-scooter felt much less stable than any bike I’ve ridden. To mitigate against injury, helmet-wearing is strongly encouraged by the major rental companies: Lime gives users a discount if they upload a selfie of themselves wearing a helmet before a ride. In the Netherlands, traditional e-scooters are illegal; larger, sturdier devices that resemble conventional bicycles, but are used in a standing position, are commonly used. Despite these concerns, it seems near-inevitable that e-scooters will be legalised in the near future: they are already legal in many European countries. In October 2020, the House of Commons Transport Committee recommended that the Department for Transport should legalise private e-scooters, subject to stricter enforcement against pavement use and pavement clutter, and with speed limits. Most experts, Lorna Stevenson included, would welcome such a move. “We need to have a grownup conversation about the fact that we need to drastically reduce our carbon emissions from transport,” she says. “If it’s not e-scooters and e-bikes, then what is it?” Al is likewise convinced that his days of being stopped by police for riding his scooter will soon be at an end. “I know it will be legalised,” he insists. “And then we’ll have freedom.” Some names have been changed.",News/UK news,‘I know they’re exciting – but calm down!’ Britain’s love-hate affair with the e-scooter,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/27/i-know-theyre-exciting-but-calm-down-britains-love-hate-affair-with-the-e-scooter
4/27/2022,"MPs have criticised the government for its “unacceptable” failure to draw up plans to recover nearly £5bn taken from the coronavirus emergency bounceback loan scheme by fraudsters. The government must give more resources to counter-fraud agencies and account properly for how much of the money will be lost forever, according to a report published on Wednesday by parliament’s influential public accounts committee. In a package of measures developed under the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, the government focused its support for the economy at the start of the coronavirus pandemic on companies and people in work. The bounceback loan scheme (BBLS) was aimed at supporting small businesses, while the furlough scheme covered 80% of the wages of people unable to do their jobs. However, the MPs said that the government was “complacent in preventing fraud” in particular in bounceback loans, which were given by banks but 100% guaranteed by the state – leaving taxpayers with the bill. An estimated £4.9bn of the £47bn spent on the BBLS was lost to fraud, while another £12bn has been lost via the scheme mainly through businesses collapsing during the pandemic. Another £5.7bn is estimated to have been lost from fraud and error within the furlough and self-employment schemes, two of the other key support schemes during the crisis. The business department and the state-owned British Business Bank, which managed the bounceback scheme through 24 commercial lenders, missed opportunities to reduce the level of fraud and are relying too much on the lenders recovering stolen money, MPs said. Government officials understood the risks entailed in the design of the scheme, and obtained a ministerial direction to override the usual requirements on value for money. Dame Meg Hillier, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said: “With weary inevitability we see a government department using the speed and scale of its response to the pandemic as an excuse for complacent disregard for the cost to the taxpayer. “More than two years on, [the business department] has no long-term plans to chase overdue debt and is not focused on lower-level fraudsters who may well just walk away with billions of taxpayers’ money.” The government’s failure to devote more resources to chasing the fraud has frustrated anti-corruption campaigners and led directly to the resignation of a minister, Lord Agnew, at the dispatch box. Agnew said the government had left a “Dad’s Army Operation” in charge of recovering taxpayer money, and that it was a “disgrace” that only 49 arrests had been made up to March across an estimated 100,000 fraud cases. The report said: “It is unacceptable that the department has no long-term plans for recovering overdue debts and it cannot just accept the current level of accepted debt.” The MPs’ report said the government was much too slow in introducing basic checks such as looking for duplicate applications, and that even the most up-to-date estimates of fraud losses are likely understating the true cost because they do not include fraud from companies overstating their turnover to qualify for bigger loans. The report said: “We are concerned that its complacency towards smaller scale fraud and turnover misstatement provides a limited deterrent effect and could encourage fraudsters to try to take advantage of other government schemes.” The business department was approached for comment.",News/UK news,"Fraud in Covid bounceback loan scheme not being addressed, say MPs",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/27/covid-bounceback-loan-scheme-fraud-public-accounts-committee
4/27/2022,"Why are we doing this to our children? As exam term begins, the question hangs over millions of households. NHS figures suggest that 17% of 6- to 16-year-olds in England now suffer from a “probable mental disorder”, and the incidence has risen by 50% since 2017. In a survey by the children’s commissioner for England, two-thirds of children ranked homework and exams as their greatest cause of stress. Responding to a poll by the National Education Union, 73% of teachers said they believed the mental health of their students had deteriorated since the government introduced its “reformed” GCSEs, which put more weight on final exams and less on coursework and other assessments. These reforms, imposed on schools by Michael Gove against expert advice, may have contributed to the OECD’s shocking finding in 2019 that, of the 72 nations in which the life satisfaction of 15-year-olds was assessed, the UK came 69th. Our children’s joy of living suffered the greatest decline of any country since 2015, the year in which the GCSE reforms became effective. If we are going to subject young people, already so vulnerable, to the extreme stress and anxiety of exams, there must be an excellent reason. So what is it? Given the importance of the subject, it’s remarkable how thin and infrequent are the government’s justifications. For a sustained attempt by a senior government figure to justify the English system, you must go back to an article by the previous education secretary, Damian Hinds, that he wrote for the Sunday Times in 2019. While he accepted that exams were stressful and had “a disproportionate effect on young people’s wellbeing”, he claimed, without any supporting evidence, that this stress was important in “building character” and “developing the resilience and coping mechanisms to deal with challenging experiences”. In reality, the great majority of people who suffer mental health disorders develop them as children or young adults. Great stress in childhood is likely to make us less resilient, not more. Hinds’ article – simple-minded, hackneyed, cavalier – makes a strong case, but not the one he intended. It shows that you can pass your exams, enter a top university and become a cabinet minister, yet fail to achieve basic standards of research, insight, originality, reasoned argument, empathy or humanity. But at least he tried. While the current education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, has insisted we return to the exam model that was suspended during the pandemic, he has made no attempt to explain why. What exams measure is aptitude in exams. While they might rank certain skills, such as the retention of facts and the performance of linear tasks under pressure, these represent just a small part of the equipment a person needs to navigate the world. Many of the challenges we face are complex, long-lasting and multi-layered. They might demand social and emotional intelligence rather than the ability to marshal facts, and might best be overcome by collaboration instead of competition. But performance in these narrow, unrepresentative tests can determine the entire future course of a student’s life. Some will be branded failures, creating a self-image that will never be erased. I’ve met children who are brilliant in peculiar ways, but who flunk exams. I’ve met adults who, often after long struggles with self-esteem and social condescension, succeed magnificently despite their low grades. I’ve met others whose evident talents remain unrecognised, as they never overcome the stigma. It’s not the child who fails the system. It’s the system, seeking to force everyone into the same box, that fails the child. It pathologises diversity. For example, as The ADHD Explosion, by the clinical psychologist Stephen Hinshaw and the health economist Richard Scheffler, suggests, a massive increase in ADHD diagnoses appears to be linked to the rise in high-stakes testing. As exams become more important, parents have a greater incentive to seek the diagnosis and acquire the drugs that might improve their child’s performance. At the same time, as a report by the education professor Merryn Hutchings argues, more children are likely to show ADHD symptoms in a stressful, channelled schooling system that forces them to sit still for long periods and reduces opportunities for creative, physical and practical work. Exams distort every aspect of education. It’s not just a matter of “teaching to the test” and drilling pupils in rote learning rather than encouraging deep understanding, independence and creative thought. They also ensure that the curriculum is narrow and compartmentalised, sealing testable knowledge into artificial boxes. This partitioning, coupled with the ridiculously early specialisation of the English education system, ensures that by the time we reach our late teens we can scarcely understand each other, let alone the world into which we emerge. So what are exams for? Preserving privilege. Privilege loves competition, because it can always be rigged. Private schools and parents who pay for tuition can afford to drum the necessary requirements into a child, even one whose mind seeks to travel in other directions. If there is a better case for exams, this government hasn’t made it. They inflict pain and distress on our children, narrow their minds and force them to conform. They turn education, which should be rich with the joy of discovery, into an instrumental misery. They exacerbate injustice, exclusion and inequality.

4/27/2022,"The first exhibition of the work of Lucian Freud to be held at the home of his grandfather, Sigmund Freud, will include unseen and rarely seen drawings and letters that throw new light on the artist’s boyhood interests. The exhibition, one of a number marking the 100th anniversary this year of Lucian Freud’s birth, will feature paintings, drawings, family photographs, books and letters. They are drawn from galleries, private collections, family members and the archives of the Freud Museum. The museum is in the family home in Hampstead, north London, where Sigmund Freud spent his final year after fleeing the Nazis, and where he died in 1939. Lucian Freud, who became one of the 20th century’s most revered artists, often visited his grandfather at the house. The exhibition includes “quite a lot of newly discovered materials or previously unpublished material about his childhood, adolescence and early manhood,” said its curator, the art critic Martin Gayford. “A cache of books that he owned in the 1930s has come to light. There is one about [Hans] Holbein portraits, one about birds, another of cartoons by a man called Wilhelm Busch, who Lucian was very keen on. They give us a better picture of what was in his mind when he was starting out as an artist.” One of the items that will be displayed is Freud’s sole surviving sculpture, Three-legged Horse, created when the artist was a teenager. “Riding was one of his great enthusiasms; horses were one of his great loves right to the end of his life – although there are probably more dogs in his work. He was very interested in relations between animals and people,” said Gayford. The exhibition includes several portraits of Lucian Freud’s mother, Lucie. “He had complicated feelings about his parents, particularly about his mother, who in a way, he used to say, was too close to him. She was too interested in his affairs, and very interested in him being an artist. After his father died, he painted and drew her very regularly,” said Gayford. In a parallel between the grandfather’s and the grandson’s work, a portrait of Lucie lying on a bed will hang over the couch on which Sigmund Freud’s patients reclined in during psychoanalysis sessions – now a centrepiece of the museum. Lucian was “very fond” of his grandfather, said Gayford. “He used to say his relationship with his grandfather was very straightforward; it was other people’s relationship with his grandfather which creates complexities or confusion. But he also expressed complete lack of interest in psychoanalysis.” Gayford, the author of a number of art books, sat for a portrait by Lucian in 2003-2005. “It was an enthralling experience, and a very prolonged one. You didn’t just turn up for a sitting – he wanted to get to know as much as he possibly could about his sitters. So a sitting would usually start with a cup of tea or a drink, and there would be dinner afterwards. It was a very thorough examination.” Carol Seigel, director of the Freud Museum, said: “This timely exhibition brings together the two men, grandfather and grandson, in Sigmund Freud’s final home, which Lucian would have visited often. The exhibition looks at Lucian’s work through the perspective of family connections, a subject on which his grandfather had developed radical new thinking.” Lucian Freud: Family Matters is at the Freud Museum in Hampstead from 6 July until 29 January.",Arts/Art and design,Lucian Freud exhibition held at Freud Museum for the first time,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/27/lucian-freud-exhibition-held-at-freud-museum-for-the-first-time
4/27/2022,"Brexit has pushed up the price of food imported from the EU, compounding Britain’s unfolding cost of living crisis, according to a report. The thinktank UK in a Changing Europe (UKICE) said trade barriers introduced after leaving the EU had led to a 6% increase in UK food prices between December 2019 and September 2021, adding to the rising financial pressure for households. The report found products with a higher EU import share, such as fresh pork, tomatoes and jams, were worse-affected than items where UK imports were more commonly sourced from the rest of the world, such as tuna and exotic fruits like pineapple. Households across the UK are on track to suffer the worst living standards squeeze since the 1950s amid soaring inflation driven by the rising price of energy, food and fuel. Annual inflation reached 7% in March, the highest rate since 1992. Economists have warned that inflation, which acts as a gauge for the rising cost of living, could hit 10% this year amid rising prices for gas and electricity triggered by the war in Ukraine. The report, produced by researchers from the London School of Economics’ Centre for Economic Performance with funding from UKICE, found that a “clear and robust impact of Brexit-induced trade frictions” had led to the increase in prices. It said Covid-19 could be ruled out as an influencing factor because there was a correlation between price increases and the share of EU imports for a particular product. Analysing trade figures compiled by the UN and price data from the Office for National Statistics, it found the two most notable increases coincided with Boris Johnson’s 2019 election victory, when a “hard Brexit” became more likely, and the implementation of the post-Brexit trade deal in January 2021. Figures from the ONS show that consumer food prices fell over the period analysed by the academics. Prices have risen sharply in recent months as the cost of living spirals upwards. The analysts said this suggested that in absence of Brexit food prices could have further fallen. The UK has repeatedly delayed import checks on goods arriving from the EU as ministers sought to minimise disruption. The prime minister hinted last week that physical Brexit border checks on food imports from the EU due to be introduced in July would be delayed for the fourth time amid fears that supplies could be affected. Other economists say it is difficult to disentangle the effects of Brexit from other factors such as the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia’s war in Ukraine, movements in financial markets, global trade bottlenecks and shortages of workers and supplies across advanced economies. Official forecasts suggest fuel and utility bills will account for nearly half of this year’s rise in inflation. Although the government has emphasised this point, pro-Brexit ministers had previously said that leaving the EU would bring down food costs by opening up the British market to exporters from around the world. Government sources said that agricultural commodity prices were linked to global gas costs. “To blame Brexit is simply wrong,” they added. Figures from the accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young show that UK businesses and consumers paid £4.8bn in customs duties on imported goods last year, a new record, and up from £2.9bn a year earlier. Sean Glancy, a partner at the accountancy firm, said that some of the rise will have been due to a post-pandemic recovery in trade but that most of it was probably due to leaving the EU. “Brexit related customs duty increases could not come at a worse time for British businesses and consumers. Inflationary pressures caused by Covid and the war in Ukraine are being exacerbated by those extra import duties,” he said. Jonathan Portes, a senior research fellow at UKICE, said: “While Brexit is not the main driver of rising inflation or the cost of living crisis, this report provides clear evidence that it has led to a substantial increase in food prices, which will hit the poorest families hardest.” A government spokesperson said: “Food prices fluctuate in any given year and depend on a range of factors including exchange rates and commodity prices. The sustained increase in global gas prices has led to increased input costs for the dairy and egg industries, including feed and fuel costs.”",News/Politics,Post-Brexit trade barriers increase price of food imported from EU – report,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/27/post-brexit-trade-barriers-increase-price-of-food-imported-from-eu-report
4/27/2022,"Organised criminals have accidentally been given incentives by the government to fly-tip, a damning report by the National Audit Office has found. Fly-tipping has increased year-on-year in England since 2012-13 and reached 1.13 million recorded incidents in 2020-21 – at a cost of £11.6m to clear large-scale incidents. The NAO said the large rise in the rate of landfill tax has increased the amount of money criminals can make from waste crime. The amount of waste sent to landfill dropped by 75% between 2010-11 and 2020-21. At the same time, there has been an increase in the money criminals can make by avoiding landfill tax through the misdescription of waste, illegal waste sites, and some types of fly-tipping. HM Revenue and Customs estimates that in 2019-20, £200m of landfill tax was not paid through non-compliance. They also found that over the years, organised crime groups have become more involved in waste crime as it has become more lucrative. Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “The evidence available shows that waste crime is increasing, and organised criminals are becoming more involved. “Government needs to target resources effectively and understand what progress it is making towards its aim of eliminating waste crime by 2043. To do so, it will need a robust set of performance measures to identify when actions are off-track.” The government has blamed the pandemic for slow progress on tackling fly-tipping, arguing that Defra resources had to be diverted elsewhere. The Liberal Democrats accused the government of “legalising littering”. In the year 2020-21, incidents rose by 16% on the previous year but the number of fixed-penalty notices issued fell by 24%, and the number of prosecutions dropped by more than 50%. They are calling on the government to crack down on illegal rubbish dumping, by increasing court fines and putting the money raised into a “fly-tipping fighting fund” for local authorities. The party argues that if the average fine was tripled to £1,000, this could raise £1.3m a year to tackle fly-tipping. The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, Alistair Carmichael, said: “Conservative ministers have effectively legalised littering by turning a blind eye to this fly-tipping epidemic. The buck stops with them and their failure to tackle this.” The Labour party has also criticised the Conservatives’ record on litter. Jim McMahon, the shadow secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs, said: “This is a damning indictment of the government’s negligence in tackling waste crime in England, letting criminals off the hook and leaving a financial and environmental burden on our country.” Sir James Bevan, chief executive at the Environment Agency, said: “Waste crime causes harm to people and places, and it is on the rise. This is why we have created a robust new strategy which is intelligence-led, collaborative and high-tech, focusing on combating the worst criminals. “We now share intelligence on criminals with our partners, resulting in more than 2,500 illegal waste sites being shut down permanently in the last three years. “This is not an easy fight – but with the support of our partners we are determined to keep one step ahead of the criminals, shut them out of the system and move us towards an economy in which there is no space for waste crime.”",News/Environment,"Landfill tax rises boosting fly-tipping, says spending watchdog",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/27/landfill-tax-rises-boosting-fly-tipping-says-spending-watchdog
4/27/2022,"On an inky November night, Nigel, Neil, Karl and Carl amble on to the stage of a disused Yorkshire cinema to the strains of Neil Young’s My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue). Slumped in a chair with Covid fatigue, my nerves already jangled by a drive-by shouting en route, I burst into tears. I can scarcely believe this band exist. The return of Half Man Half Biscuit, four lads who shook Wirral with chugging indie-rock, is greeted ecstatically by those packed into the Holmfirth Picturedrome. Launching into a song about bats followed by one about bereavement, they neatly summarise the mood swings of the world in the preceding 20 months – and Biscuitmania erupts. It took me six hours to get here in the car, and it’s worth every minute. Someone who travelled even further is Glaswegian John Ross, who came down from Scotland with a group of friends, including one, Francis, sadly no longer of this Earthly realm, his ashes ensconced in cellophane down John’s sock lest a bouncer query the fine white powder. A chance pre-gig meeting with lead singer Nigel Blackwell brings a fitting tribute to their fallen comrade, a fan of the band since 1987. John takes up the story: “I went up to him and said, ‘Excuse me, Nigel, this is going to sound weird,’ and he replied: ‘It already does in that accent, mate.’ I explained the situation and he was brilliant. He spent about five minutes chatting to me about Francis.” Halfway through the gig, Nigel retrieves the wrap from his top pocket and sprinkles the ashes on the stage as requested before dedicating Look Dad No Tunes to the departed fan. “I was absolutely elated,” says John. “I’d been expecting to spread his ashes on a beer-soaked floor. To have Nigel say lovely things about him, make some jokes and treat Francis’s ashes with the same care and respect that he would someone he knew well, was amazing. I wasn’t expecting the eulogy. That was way over and above what I’d hoped for.” This emotional send-off is an example of how Half Man Half Biscuit – AKA Nigel Blackwell, Neil Crossley, Carl Henry and Karl Benson – have generated one of the most passionate fan communities of any British band. Apart from the occasional spin on BBC Radio 6 Music, they largely exist under the radar, which is how they like it. Born of Thatcher’s all-encompassing dole culture, their 1985 debut album Back in the DHSS was recorded for about £40. A lo-fi slice of kitchen-sink surrealism, it featured songs about Subbuteo (All I Want for Christmas Is a Dukla Prague Away Kit) and the mundanity of everyday existence. Publicity-shy even then, they turned down an appearance on Channel 4’s The Tube as it clashed with a Tranmere Rovers match, even refusing the offer of a helicopter as it would only have got them to Prenton Park at half-time. With their star in the ascendant, championed by John Peel and with Dickie Davies Eyes topping the indie singles chart, Nigel sensationally split the band in 1986 to the dismay of their burgeoning fanbase. However, after a near four-year silence, the group were booked to appear at the 1990 Reading festival. Straight-faced, wearing shorts, they launched into a storming set of old songs and new, with one fan dangerously wielding a potted plant throughout. They have played a handful of gigs every year since, and I have seen them numerous times, up to the first lockdown. In the depths of quarantine, I forged a plan to make up for lost time by never missing another Half Man gig. It would be a post-lockdown gift to myself: have a good time, all the time. The downside is that I live in London and they rarely stray south, adhering to the time-honoured mantra of “own bed, own bog”. The upside is that it’s the best two hours of the month, grinning through a thrilling rock show interspersed with deadpan humour from the enigmatic Nigel. He rarely does interviews, doesn’t want the band to be photographed and still suffers from pre-gig nerves. He is more at ease cycling round Wirral or enjoying tea and toast in front of nostalgia channel Talking Pictures TV. As far removed from the music industry as it’s feasible for a musician to be, this is an approach that has yielded 15 wildly entertaining albums to date, all skewering societal mores through an absurdist lens in songs such as Rock and Roll Is Full of Bad Wools (about landfill indie bands on Soccer AM), Bottleneck at Capel Curig (about A-road congestion) and the self-explanatory Knobheads on Quiz Shows. While early gigs were largely attended by football fans, it’s now a broad church, with a cosplay element creeping in. I myself am guilty of wearing a personalised Dukla Prague away kit, which enabled me to mingle with a gang of HMHB ultras in a Nottingham pub before their recent Rock City gig. The most visible proponent of this trend is retired GP John Burscough from Lincolnshire, who accidentally rediscovered the band at the 2008 Cornbury music festival. “I thought, ‘Fucking hell, why have I not been on to this?’” he says. “I bought CSI: Ambleside off the merch table, listened to it all the way home and got hooked. I went to see them in Sheffield and thought, ‘People are dressing up for this. This is great, this is what I like. This is a gang, I can be their king.’” Sixty gigs later, John now routinely comes as the titular character of King of Hi-Vis, a song that has only ever been played live on five occasions – and he was there for them all. I’ve spotted him at gigs but never realised that beneath his fluorescent tabard was an actual tour jacket with detachable sleeves, the name of a spoken word song that has never been performed. He rounds off the combo with a pair of Joy Division Oven Gloves, a kitchen accessory inspired by the HMHB song of the same name. At the time of our conversation, it is hours away from its 132nd airing. This and other stats can be found on The Half Man Half Biscuit Lyrics Project website, subtitled “220 pop songs picked over by pedants”, a resource run by Chris Rand from Cambridge, who is also present in the pub, in regulation Dukla Prague kit, sandwiching the Nottingham gig between Genesis at the O2 and Ipswich Town playing at home, presumably in a Venn diagram of one. “We always get a bump in visitors to the site when there’s a new album,” says Chris, of Half Man’s latest LP, The Voltarol Years. “But this one was like nothing else – three or four times the traffic we’ve ever had. Extraordinary.” Much of the discussion has been about the heartbreaking penultimate track, Slipping the Escort, where Nigel takes his tongue out of his cheek to devastating effect on a song about an elderly couple confronting dementia. While some fans relish the band’s outsider status (even though they regularly fill midsized venues and their last two albums reached the UK Top 40) others are indignant that Nigel doesn’t have a larger audience. Fan Stephen Blackmore says: “I’m frightened that, when they do finally pack it in, no one’s going to know who they were. Someone needs to make a documentary. There needs to be a lasting legacy.” John has more prosaic concerns: “My only worry is that he’ll be knocked off his bike on a country lane.” Since becoming a full-time follower, I have noticed a distinct cross-generational aspect, with parents indoctrinating their offspring. Jonas Mackay, 17, went to the Rock City gig with his dad, Shane, who spent lockdown amassing the entire back catalogue and bombarding his family with it. “I genuinely think it’s something worth spreading the word about and trying to inculcate my children with,” Shane says. “Do they know how much people love and appreciate them?” They do. Between toast and cycling, Nigel emails me thus: “The band are more than grateful that people come and watch us and especially those that go the extra mile. Although statistically some of those people may have killed or carried out some dark arts, they never seem to bring that personality out on the evenings when we’re playing, so all is well from our angle. Hats off to ’em.”  The Voltarol Years is out now, with a vinyl edition released in July.

4/27/2022,"So loudly unobtrusive, their lives confined from dawn to dusk to a copse that I could walk through in three minutes, the closest deer were always the least visible. How many of the passersby who sidestepped the mocha-coloured pellets on the adjoining path linked those scatterings to the hoarse barks coming from the bushes? I once found the elderly man who took his daily lockdown walk here, leaning in towards the shouting thicket. He turned to me and asked: “What is it?” In an abandoned meadow where I can still picture the ghosts of sheep and cattle past, a male muntjac has his head down, feeding a good hour beyond sunrise. I have had more muntjac sightings around here in the last four months than in the previous 25 years, and this is the most brazen yet. Have all the deer lost their fear, or am I seeing the same animal again and again? Will he stick, or twist and run? In the manner of all ruminants, he is both distracted and alert. Lips, tongue and mouth work the turf, while side-on eyes keep a steady watch. I’ve paced along to the nearest point, barring the way between deer and safe woodland, and yet still he grazes. I’ve given him the heads up; he has his head down. But when I stop, the wild kicks in. The buck raises his head and gives me a long, soft look. A muntjac does not have the snooty stare of a red deer stag; he’s more of a dark-eyed spaniel begging a treat. His face is quite beautiful: a steep, deep-brown V arrowing from just above his muzzle to understated prongs the length of my index finger. For a long moment we gaze at each other with curiosity, then he moves. A jerk of his head lifting just a fraction, the frisson of a wild animal fully acknowledging what I am, trying to gauge the distance from danger. Some threat – but not so much, it would seem, for he swivels without flipping up his tail into a danger flag. A few bounding metres, then he turns back, drops his head, and carries on eating.
