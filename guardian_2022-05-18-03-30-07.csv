5/18/2022,"A China Eastern Airlines plane that crashed in March, killing 132 people, appears to have been intentionally flown into the mountainside below by someone at the controls, according to reports. Analysis by US officials of the black box flight recorders found amid the wreckage suggests deliberate input from the cockpit forced the Boeing 737-800 plane into its catastrophic dive. The Wall Street Journal quoted an unnamed source who said: “The plane did what it was told to do by someone in the cockpit.” The China Eastern plane was cruising at a steady altitude and speed before it suddenly descended more than 20,000 feet in just over a minute, and crashing near the city of Wuzhou in Guangxi province. Chinese investigators have led the crash inquiry but US officials are involved as the plane is US-made. While faults in the design of Boeing’s later 737-Max model were behind two fatal disasters in 2018 and 2019, leading to the model’s grounding worldwide, the 737-800 has long been in everyday service around the world. Aviation experts had noted that the flight pattern shown on tracking sites, and lack of reported mayday call or any loss of data signal, resembled the Germanwings crash in 2015. On that occasion, the Airbus A320 passenger plane was crashed deliberately by the pilot as it crossed the French Alps, killing 150 people. The WSJ reported that Chinese authorities have not indicated to their US counterparts that there was any mechanical or flight-control problems with the plane that crashed on 21 March. China Eastern has said that the pilot and co-pilot were both in good health and had no known financial or family issues. Authorities in China said soon after the crash that no emergency code had been sent from the plane, suggesting no intruder could have reached the cockpit. China’s air regulator has not commented beyond saying last month that investigators were continuing their inquiries.

5/18/2022,"Mastercard is rolling out a controversial programme that will allow shoppers to pay at the till with a mere smile or wave of the hand, as it tries to secure a slice of the $18bn (£14.4bn) biometrics market. While face recognition technology has long raised eyebrows among civil rights groups, the payments giant said it was pushing ahead with a biometric checkout programme it claimed would speed up payments, cut queues and provide more security than a standard credit or debit card. “Once enrolled, there is no need to slow down the checkout queue searching through their pockets or bag,” Mastercard said. “Consumers can simply check the bill and smile into a camera or wave their hand over a reader to pay.” Mastercard also claimed the new payment system would be more hygienic, tapping into health concerns that came to the fore in the Covid pandemic. The first pilots will launch in Brazil at five St Marche supermarkets in São Paulo, this week, with shoppers able to register for biometric payments in store or via an app with their local partner, Payface. A spokesperson for Mastercard said a UK rollout was part of its “near-term plan”, and that the company was having “encouraging conversations with potential partners”. In the meantime, it will focus on launching the technology in markets including Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. The scheme is part of Mastercard’s efforts to enter the contactless biometrics technology market, which is expected to be worth $18.6bn by 2026, according to data by KBV Research. The payments giant is competing with big tech rivals such as Amazon, which has used palm readers at its stores, which have attracted criticism from US politicians due to data privacy concerns. Mastercard pointed to research suggesting that 74% of global consumers had a “positive attitude” towards biometric technology, though activists have long raised concerns over data storage and tracking. Suzie Miles, a partner at lawfirm Ashfords said: “Mastercard themselves have recognised the data and security concerns that come with the use of biometrics. A password can be changed, your smile and wave can not. If biometric data is hacked then the risk of fraudulent activity could be considerably higher than current payment methods.” There are also debates about how the data could be used to track, screen or monitor unsuspecting consumers. “While it seems Mastercard have taken steps to protect and encrypt this data, as biometric payments become more commonplace the use of such data is likely to evolve and it will inevitably become harder to protect individuals rights to privacy,” Miles said.",News/Technology,Mastercard launches ‘smile to pay’ amid privacy concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/17/mastercard-launches-smile-to-pay-amid-privacy-concerns
5/18/2022,"With the number of cases of monkeypox in the UK rising to seven, what is the situation and is it cause for concern? Monkeypox is a viral infection typically found in central and western Africa. A handful of cases have previously been diagnosed in the UK, with the first recorded in 2018 in an individual thought to have contracted the virus in Nigeria. There are two forms of monkeypox, a milder west African strain and a more severe central African, or Congo, strain. It is thought recently diagnosed individuals have the west African strain. According to the UK Health Security Agency, early symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and chills, as well as other features such as exhaustion. “A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body, including the genitals,” the UKHSA says. “The rash changes and goes through different stages, and can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.” Most people usually recover from monkeypox in a few weeks. Monkeypox does not spread easily between humans, and requires close contact. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is thought that human-to-human transmission primarily occurs through large respiratory droplets. “Respiratory droplets generally cannot travel more than a few feet, so prolonged face-to-face contact is required,” the CDC says. “Other human-to-human methods of transmission include direct contact with body fluids or lesion material, and indirect contact with lesion material, such as through contaminated clothing or linens.” The first recent case in the UK was reported on 7 May, with the patient having recently travelled to Nigeria. A week later, a further two patients were reported as being treated for monkeypox in London. They lived in the same household and their infections are thought to be unconnected to the previous case. On Monday another four cases of monkeypox were reported, three in London, and one in the north-east of England. These four cases do not appear to be linked to either of the previous ones, and all those involved are thought to have been infected in London. All four of these cases are in men who self-identify as gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men. While Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health, University of Southampton, says the latest cases may be the first time transmission of monkeypox though sexual contact has been documented, this has not been confirmed, and in any case it is probably close contact that matters. “There is no evidence that it is a sexually transmitted virus, such as HIV,” he says “It’s more that here the close contact during sexual or intimate activity, including prolonged skin-to-skin contact, may be the key factor during transmission.” The UKHSA is advising gay and bisexual men, as well as other communities of men who have sex with men, to look out for unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, in particular their genitalia. “Anyone with concerns that they could be infected with monkeypox is advised to make contact with clinics ahead of their visit,” the UKHSA says. At present, the answer seems to be: not much. Experts have suggested it is unlikely there will be a large outbreak, although it is important contacts of those infected are identified. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser, UKHSA, calls the situation “rare and unusual” but adds: “UKHSA is rapidly investigating the source of these infections because the evidence suggests that there may be transmission of the monkeypox virus in the community, spread by close contact.”",News/Science,What is monkeypox and should UK residents be worried?,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/17/what-is-monkeypox-and-should-uk-residents-be-worried
5/18/2022,"One of Ukraine’s largest farming groups has called for an urgent solution to unblock the country’s Black Sea ports as exports of grain, sunflower and rapeseed are being held up by the Russian naval blockade, driving inflation and shortages around the world. G7 ministers have held urgent talks about trying to open routes through Romanian and Baltic ports, potentially fed with an army of 10,000 trucks making a five-day trip from Ukraine. John Rich, the chairman of MHP, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said: “If we had a UN agreement in place it would solve an enormous amount of issues.” But he said that without the war ending such a deal was unlikely, piling pressure on prices for grain and seeds used for cooking oil and ethanol around the world into next year. “We are now in a vicious cycle,” Rich said. “Normally what happens is that farmers cure high prices as [when prices go up] farmers produce more and prices collapse. This time it could be different,” Rich said pointing to a combination of climate change, the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine, as well as fertiliser shortages which are hitting production around the world. He said the world could be looking at a “cascade of export bans”, following India’s block on the export of wheat and Indonesia’s block on palm oil exports, raising the prospect that “the whole concept of globalisation in food production is dead”. Exports from Ukraine, which produces as much as half the world’s sunflower seeds, a tenth of wheat and up to a fifth of barley and rapeseed, have been severely interrupted by the closure of Ukraine’s ports following Russia’s invasion. Only about 1m tonnes of grain and seed were exported in April compared with more than 5m tonnes of grain and 700,000 tonnes of oilseeds a month in a typical year. Before the war, about 80% of Ukraine’s grain and oilseeds were exported via the Black Sea but that route is now cut off, creating a bottleneck as farmers prepare to harvest the summer crops. Efforts are being made to increase the pace of exports, by increasing the use of trucks and improving rail capacity and links, which are hampered by differing track gauges in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. However, Rich said road and rail could replace little more than a quarter of the capacity that once flowed through Ukraine’s ports and would take time to develop. He said MHP was fairly confident its own crops could be sent out via truck and train to ports in Poland and Lithuania, and the company was processing more sunflower seeds into oil within Ukraine, for example, to help lower transport and storage costs. The blockade means grain silos are full and farmers are struggling to find storage for the summer crops. Without a solution, he said that many would be reluctant to plant for the winter. “There is going to be a lot of soul searching when it comes to winter 2022 and it is going to be all about logistics and storage,” he said. “We are in a real dilemma at present,” he said. “There is a huge bottleneck and it is not easily solved, certainly not in the next six or eight weeks. Unless the Russian fleet is sunk, I don’t see a solution. I can’t see any solution to this in a very, very long time.” Production of wheat, sunflower oil and other crops in Ukraine is expected to be down by about 35% this year as planting and harvests in east of the country have been affected by fighting. Rich said production in the rest of the country was good with “growing conditions excellent” and MHP’s farms had been able to secure enough fertiliser and other inputs. “We are in good shape, the season so far is going well,” he said, although the long range forecast for the region is that it will be unusually hot this year. But he said production could be lower as it was not clear how many small and medium-sized farms had been affected by shortages and price rises on diesel and fertiliser as well a concerns on storage.",News/Business,Ukraine farming group calls for urgent end to ports blockade,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/17/ukraine-farming-group-warns-of-cascade-of-export-bans-without-new-grain-routes

The report from DirecTV Sports Argentina correspondent Alex Candal on Tuesday indicated “the contract is done and will be signed in August”, despite a series of denials from people close to the Argentina international. Messi, who owns a condo in Miami Beach, has long been linked with a late-career move to the three-year-old Major League Soccer club. But those rumors were given new life on Monday when Inter Miami co-owner David Beckham posted Instagram photos of himself with PSG stars Messi, Neymar, Sergio Ramos and Kylian Mbappe. 💣💣 BOMBA DE @Alex_candal 💣💣🗣️ ""Messi va a adquirir el 35% de las acciones de Inter de Miami y en el verano de 2023 se incorporará al equipo"" pic.twitter.com/GtLbjtF0P5 Messi’s agents told Le Parisien the report “is completely false, Leo has not yet decided on his future.

5/18/2022,"Two of Wisconsin’s presidential electors and a voter in the state filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to punish a group of Republicans who tried to cast fake electoral votes for Donald Trump in 2020, asking a state court to order them to pay up to $2.4m collectively in damages and bar them from ever serving as legitimate electors in a presidential election. Wisconsin was one of seven states Trump lost in 2020 where allies cast an alternative set of electoral votes as part of his effort to overturn the election. The suit, filed by Law Forward and the Georgetown Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection (Icap) on behalf of the legitimate electors, is the first of its kind seeking civil punishments against the electors. Federal prosecutors and the January 6 commission are reportedly also reviewing the fake slates. The lawsuit, filed in Dane county, targets the 10 Republicans who served as the fake elector slate, as well as Jim Troupis, an attorney for the Trump campaign in Wisconsin, and Kenneth Chesebro, a Boston-area attorney who aided their efforts. It asks a judge to order each of them to pay a $2,000 fine as well as up to $200,000 each in damages in addition to blocking them from ever being able to serve as electors. “Although Defendants were unsuccessful in having their fake ballots counted, they caused significant harm simply by trying, and there is every reason to believe that they will try again if given the opportunity,” the complaint says. “Defendants actions also violated a host of state and federal laws. Thus far, however, none of the fraudulent electors has been held accountable. This lawsuit seeks to change that.” Chesebro sent Troupis a memo in November 2020, two weeks after election day, laying out the rationale for why alternate slates of electors should meet and cast votes for Trump in states he lost. “It may seem odd that the electors pledged to Trump and [Vice-President Mike] Pence might meet and cast their votes, even if, at that juncture, the Trump-Pence ticket is behind in the vote count,” he wrote in the memo. “However, a fair reading of the federal statutes suggests that this is a reasonable course of action.” The Trump campaign endorsed the effort and electors in Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and New Mexico all met on 14 December 2020, the day the electoral college met, to cast their votes for Trump. They sent certificates of their votes to the National Archives in Washington. “Their fraudulently submitted electoral votes fed into the false narrative that was relied on by those who violently attacked the US Capitol on January 6, halting the counting of the legitimate Electoral College votes,” Mary McCord, executive director of Icap said in a statement. “As important as it is that we hold accountable those responsible for that attack, it’s just as vital that we demand accountability for those whose fraudulent activity undermined the electoral process and weakened our democracy.” In March, the Wisconsin Elections Commission, the six-member body that oversees elections in the state, unanimously voted to reject a complaint against the fake electors alleging they broke state law. The commission relied on an analysis from the Wisconsin Department of Justice finding that the electors didn’t run afoul of state statutes and were trying to keep their legal options open, according to WisPolitics.com. Law Forward, one of the groups behind Tuesday’s lawsuit, also backed that complaint. The Wisconsin case is the latest in a number of cases filed across the US over the last year seeking to hold people who aided efforts to overturn the election accountable. Two election workers in Georgia, for example, recently reached a settlement in a defamation suit with One America News (OAN), which falsely accused the pair of counting illegal ballots. The network said shortly after the settlement there was “no widespread voter fraud.” Dominion, the voting machine company targeted by election conspiracy theorists, has also filed a number of defamation lawsuits. Other groups have sought sanctions against Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani, and other lawyers who promoted Trump’s baseless conspiracies about the election.",News/US news,Wisconsin electors and voter file lawsuit against fraudulent 2020 Trump electors ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/17/wisconsin-electors-lawsuit-trump-2020-election
5/18/2022,"Michael R Jackson’s A Strange Loop is many, many things. Cutting, uproarious and crushing, it doesn’t try to be all of these in its hour and 45 min running time, but just is. A gymnastics-like excavation into one man’s search for himself complete with “Black shit!,” “White shit!” and “butt-fucking!” Usher, a Black, fat, queer man, is a begrudged usher for a Disney Broadway show by day while, in his free time, he works on his masterwork A Strange Loop, a musical about a Black, queer, fat man writing a musical about a Black, queer, fat man, and so forth. Usher’s feigned desire to produce a “big, Black, queer-ass, American Broadway show” frequently sputters out as he deals with overwhelming bouts of heckling from his six inner thoughts (played by Antwayn Hopper [understudied by Jon-Michael Reese], James Jackson Jr, L Morgan Lee [understudied by Mars Rucker], John-Michael Lyles, Jason Veasy, and John-Andrew Morrison), who cosplay as his Bible-loving parents, rejecting lovers and other potholes. In Jackson’s complicated, full work, Usher – as a young artist and a young adult trying to make his way – is only one part of the story. The musical, which won the Pulitzer prize for drama in 2020 and leads this year’s Tony nominations, homes in on the hilarity and devastation akin to Usher’s existence while also hitting more meta-meditations on the structures that seek to make Usher feel small: an intersection of anti-Blackness, fatphobia, homophobia and Tyler Perry. It’s not just the dismissal Usher faces from his mother, who espouses love for her youngest son but an alarm for Usher’s soul amid his fraternization with “Hollywood homosexuals”. It’s not just his father, who drunkenly leaves Usher voicemails, asking his son if he’s sexually attracted to him. It’s the oppressive disgust Usher has for himself, cosigned by all the gay men who won’t sleep with him. It’s the white theater industry which only has a seat for melodramatic gospel plays written by Tyler Perry at its wobbly table (“Now that nigga knows how to write for the Blacks and make money,” echoes Usher’s father/Thought 6). So, A Strange Loop asks, how can Usher define himself outside the daily self-loathing (hysterically and empathetically played by Jackson Jr) as well as the condemnation that is mapped onto him? What does it take to break the cycle when every beam Usher leans on for support cracks under the weight of him being his truest self?Jackson’s answer is a thoughtful, hilarious, layered Strange Loop. The bracing musical never feels out of breath by all it wants to cover, giving plenty of song to Usher’s personal shortcomings amid honest jabs at the people, places, and things that leave him stuck. It also isn’t didactic or overdrawn, not so much prescription to Usher’s disappointments that are so startlingly felt, but describing them as is, with a humor and sincerity that feels completely brand new. Seamlessly transitioning between hilarity and devastation, Strange Loop leans into absurdity, yes, but gives room for the sadness and denial that orbit Usher. Even as Usher sings about the unrestricted existence of white girls in the pop ballad Inner White Girl, the underbelly of the song, that the lives of Black boys are boxed in via society’s ideals, crashes in like an emotional wrecking ball. Exile in Gayville holds similar energy. A reconstruction of Usher’s difficulty navigating gay dating apps, the upbeat ode equally holds the endless rejection Usher faces from almost everyone for being “too Black,” “too fat,” and “too feminine.” Raja Feather Kelley’s choreography infuses joy and play as Usher’s inner thoughts dance jubilantly to songs detailing his angst while also using movement to demonstrate the burdens Usher battles to stay true, like in the gut punch that is the show’s second to last song, Memories. Coupled with Jen Schriever’s intelligent lighting, stunning set design by Arnulfo Maldonado, including a full-out remake of a Tyler Perry set (with some add-ons) used later in the musical, precisely capture the show’s tone. Jackson’s book and energetic music is further uplifted under the direction of Stephen Brackett and the cast’s prowess. Usher’s six inner thoughts act and sing harmoniously, but equally triumph as individual reminders. Amid a star quality cast, Jason Veasay delivers as Thought 5 and as Usher’s stoic, disappointed father. John-Andrew Morrison as Thought 4 and Usher’s mother effortlessly embodies the overwhelming fear she has for her son, swinging between disappointment, anxiety, and humor with ease. The show’s lead, Jaquel Spivey, so rawly captures the debasement that undergirds much of Usher’s life without betraying Usher as a complete victim to his circumstances. Spivey is sharp and sarcastic, but also wounded, rounded out into the whole person that Usher wants so badly to be but doesn’t realize he already is. The biggest (and only) disappointment of A Strange Loop is its lack of an automatic encore. The show is so precise and awake, from top to bottom, that having the privilege of sitting through it only once feels unfair.",Arts/Stage,A Strange Loop review – Michael R Jackson’s thrilling Broadway triumph,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/17/a-strange-loop-review-michael-r-jacksons-thrilling-broadway-triumph
5/18/2022,"Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching Better Call Saul season six, which airs on Netflix in the UK. Do not read on unless you have watched episodes one to six. “It happens today.” With those words, and a big screeching U-turn on the highway, Kim prepared to meet her fate. At least, it feels that way – as though we are finally about to get answers to all the questions that have hung over Jimmy’s partner for so many series. The reason why I fear that the twist in Kim’s story is about to be played out is twofold. First, Peter Gould, the showrunner, teased that there would be a big cliffhanger at the end of next week’s episode, the last of the first half of the final season. There is something a little too reckless about Kim’s commitment to seeing through the Sandpiper scam, and not just because she thinks it’s cool to pull a U-ey across a central reservation. In turning home for D-Day, Kim is presumably ditching her meeting with the Jackson Mercer Foundation in Santa Fe; she is rejecting the opportunity to secure a dream job, a combination of vocation and prestige she has always looked for in her work. Given how far that work has gone in defining who Kim Wexler is, it feels like a rejection of herself – all in one turn of a steering wheel. Second, there was the cold open, in which we got a taste of the dynamic between childhood Kim and her dysfunctional mother, something that has been shown only in small glimpses. Here we watched as the pair scammed a department store out of cheap jewellery. The sparkle in her mum’s eyes afterwards is surely significant. Philip Larkin observed what parents tend to do to their children in This Be the Verse. The poem ends: “Man hands on misery to man. / It deepens like a coastal shelf. / Get out as early as you can, / And don’t have any kids yourself.” Kim appears to have observed Larkin’s instructions, having fled Nebraska and shown no inclination to become a mother. Quite how deep she has internalised the lessons taken from her mother is hidden from us. But if Kim’s U-turn is inspired by something as deep-set as her relationship with her mother, this could end up anywhere. (NB: this dramatic action was performed in the service of trying to help Jimmy solve the problem of not being able to properly impersonate someone because the guy has his arm in a cast. It is a sweet note of absurdity typical of Kim’s husband and the show as a whole.) Cocktail-hour Lalo continues his odyssey through Germany. He is looking to pin down information on Gus Fring’s involvement in the assassination attempt on him, and pin it down he does by way of an axe to the leg, as Lalo finds Werner Ziegler’s old protege, Casper, and brutalises him in the woods. Lalo’s arrival is fitting for an unstoppable villain. He parks far from Casper’s peaceful home and is detectable only at a distance, in silhouette. Casper has time to prepare for Lalo’s advance, but is clearly spooked by their brief exchange and dashes off to hide in a barn. Classic shadowy hide-and-seek ensues, only to go off script when Casper whacks Lalo with the blunt side of his woodchopper. Salamanca is down and, if we are to judge by his expression, perhaps fatefully so. What a twist in the tale. To make it worse, Lalo effectively starts begging Casper for help – for any info that can help him nail Fring. At this moment, I expected peace, a deal agreed between the two – after all, we had met a vulnerable Lalo the previous week in his encounter with Margarethe. But just as that portrayal was a lie, so is this, with sick wickle Lalo playing rope-a-dope to lure Casper in. One slash of a concealed blade, one swipe of the axe and Lalo is offering the German a tourniquet and suggesting they have a chat. Lalo back in Albuquerque for the halfway finale? Won’t be ruling it out. I have always struggled to see Howard Hamlin as a baddie, as there is something a bit too ridiculous about him to take seriously. After finally being allowed inside his domestic life, it is possible even to feel sympathetic towards him. It appears that Howard, just like Gus, has a two-home situation. Except that he is living in the guest house attached to his main home, complete with a clothes rail stuffed with smart shirts and a shoe-polishing machine that looks as if it has been stolen from a hotel. We had hints of Howard’s marital strife during his recent therapy session, and now we finally meet Mrs Hamlin. The couple share a brief moment over a rushed breakfast that shows how estranged they are. Howard makes his wife a coffee, foam art and all, which she pours unceremoniously into a vacuum flask. He suggests joining her at a social event, which she isn’t into, either. He is all ordered and buttoned up, she a bit frayed and chaotic. Both seem to be living the consequences of putting work before their relationship. The encounter ends with stiff good wishes for the day ahead; Howard is left alone with his burned-bean drink. Next up: a day of reckoning with Kim and Jimmy’s plot. What will happen to the square-jawed blond? Will he be heading for Best Quality Vacuum with the rest of them? The preposterouness of Saul Goodman’s office decor is explained – and it is all down to Francesca Liddy. Jimmy’s long-suffering secretary only agreed to work with his new alter ego on the condition that she had a say in doing up his offices. As Kim is forced to admit, she has good – if expensive – taste. The only problem is the juxtaposition between her John Grisham-style sensibilities and the quality of Saul’s clientele, who remain happy to urinate on the furniture. A more immediate illustration of the disconnect between the image and reality of Jimmy’s world we could not hope to see and, for sure, Francesca could do with another holding room to put all those punters in. Mike is redistributing Gus’s resources to take care of his own family, which is only fair and reasonable, even if Tyrus doesn’t think so. Watching from the safe house opposite, he gets to spend some precious stargazing time with his granddaughter, Kaylee, and nobody appears from the shadows to kidnap her or fake an incident with a prostitute. That is as close to domestic bliss as people can hope for right now. Another prestige appearance for Zefiro tequila. When Jimmy ends up fleeing the queue at the liquor store, he has to ditch a $500 bottle of the drink that has bound Kim and him together at key moments (their first scam, the death of Charles). Zefiro is also the brand that is served to Don Eladio when Gus finally poisons the cartel boss in Breaking Bad.",Arts/Television & radio,"Better Call Saul recap: season six, episode six – Kim’s fate now feels certain",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/17/better-call-saul-recap-season-six-episode-six-kim-wexler-casper-lalo
5/18/2022,"Two white Canadian men followed and then shot dead two Indigenous hunters because they believed they were thieves, prosecutors have told a court at the start of a murder trial in Alberta. Roger Bilodeau, 58, and his son Anthony Bilodeau, 33, have both pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder over the deaths of Jacob Sansom and his uncle, Maurice Cardinal in March 2020. The bodies of Sansom, 39, and Cardinal, 57, were found early on 28 March beside Sansom’s pickup truck on a country road near Glendon, a farming town 160 miles north-east of Edmonton. Sansom had recently lost his job as a mechanic and worked as a volunteer firefighter. Cardinal was a keen hunter and outdoorsman. Both were Métis – a distinct group that traces lineage to both Indigenous nations and European settlers – and had permission to hunt the area out of season. The killing of the men, who were returning from a successful moose hunting trip to help provide food for family members, shocked the region. Prosecutors told an Edmonton jury on Monday that the two Bilodeaus followed the two hunters, assuming the men were thieves. Roger Bilodeau believed the hunters’ truck resembled a vehicle that had been on his property earlier that day. As he followed the truck, Bilodeau called his son and asked him to follow behind and to bring a gun, said the Crown. Roger Bilodeau and the hunters stopped their trucks along a country road near Glendon. Anthony Bilodeau arrived moments later and prosecutors say he shot Sansom, then Cardinal. A postmortem concluded that Sansom was shot once in the chest and Cardinal was shot three times in his shoulder. The Bilodeaus then drove away without notifying police or paramedics. The bodies of the two men – Sansom lying in the middle of the road and Cardinal in a ditch – were discovered early the next morning by a motorist. “These were in no way justified killings,” said prosecutor Jordan Kerr, adding that the younger Bilodeau “freely made the decision to arm himself” and pursue the two men. Roger Bilodeau “clearly anticipated having a confrontation” and so “recruited” his son into bringing a weapon, Kerr said. But a lawyer for the Bilodeaus say the men acted in self defence amid concerns over property crime in the area. Lawyer Shawn Gerstel told the jury that the encounter on the rural road that night quickly escalated and that Sansom had smashed a window of Roger’s truck and punched him multiple times. “[Roger] asked for a gun for protection because he didn’t know who he was dealing with,” said Gerstel. The defence said the collar of Roger’s shirt was torn half off and Sansom’s blood was found on three areas of Bilodeau’s shirt. The defence also alleges the hunters were drunk and a medical examiner is expected to testify that Sansom’s blood alcohol levelwas almost triple the legal driving limit. Cardinal’s blood alcohol limit was nearly double the legal the limit for driving, the defence says. On Monday, Sansom’s brother James told the court that Jacob was trained as a martial artist and had the ability to de-escalate tense situations.

A $44bn (£35bn) deal has been agreed and a bidder can’t speculate about putting it “on hold” while he takes another look under the bonnet. On the pure rights and wrongs of the standoff, sympathy lies entirely with Twitter. Once takeover terms have been agreed, it shouldn’t matter if the ratio of worthless bots – or fake accounts – on the social media site is under 5% (as the company says) or a multiple of that figure. Musk had his chance to demand proof of 5% before he entered a binding contract, but didn’t take it. Since one of his big pre-bid boasts was about how he would weed out spam content and restore Twitter to real users, he can’t claim he was unaware of the debate around the accuracy of Twitter’s measurement system. His behaviour is disgraceful. It may also be effective, however. Twitter’s board will find itself with a choice of only two unattractive options if Musk says he’s only prepared to proceed at a lower bid price. The first would be to refuse to play ball and ask the courts to enforce the takeover agreement. That path involves a long battle and, almost certainly, another whack to a share price that has already collapsed to its pre-bid level around the $37 mark. The second option would be to roll over and negotiate. The guess here is that Twitter’s board would accept the humiliation of renegotiation, mutter a few words about market volatility and dress up a U-turn as an act of pragmatism. There’d still be no guarantee of securing terms, of course. But, as Neil Campling, head of technology research at Mirabaud says, no new bidder is about to turn up to save the day and “Musk knows he holds all the cards in this game of poker”. One rather hopes, though, that Twitter’s board tries to tough it out. Musk’s tactics look increasingly like a cynical ploy to enfeeble his target before moving in for the kill. We can enjoy the sport – and Twitter’s board can probably be blamed for being naive – but the simple principle at the heart of this saga is still worth defending. Bidders should honour their promises. The sense that Vodafone is a big beast that moves terribly slowly won’t shift as long as the chief executive, Nick Read, offers end-of-year summaries as dull as this: “Our near-term operational and portfolio priorities remain unchanged from those communicated six months ago,” he declared alongside full-year numbers. Pulses did not race. To be fair to Read, the operational numbers within Vodafone’s “adjusted” earnings of €15.2bn, up 5%, were OK. Profit margins were the best since 2009. In the UK the rate of churn – the ratio of departing customers – was the lowest ever. The only real blemish was Germany, where the operation seems to have been slow to adapt to a regulatory tweak. But the investor focus these days is concentrated on those “portfolio priorities”, meaning deal-making to make Vodafone’s empire simpler and to capitalise on the telecoms consolidation wave in Europe. On that front, Read reported “live opportunities in a number of markets”, but investors had assumed as much already. The challenge is landing an opportunity. Competition regulators prowl the corporate dancefloor, so nobody can pretend deal-doing is easy, but Read must know he is under increasing pressure to deliver some form of shake-up in the next 12 months. A combo with Three in the UK is an obvious possibility, but the list of ideas runs through Spain, Italy, Portugal and possibly the Netherlands. The arrival of Emirates Telecommunications Group as a near-10% shareholder probably doesn’t turn up the heat immediately since the UAE-based group’s public position (for now) is sweetly supportive. But the other 90% of investors also matter. They’ve bought the thesis that there’s value to be unlocked at Vodafone but a becalmed share price remained stubbornly becalmed.",News/Business,"Dear Mr Musk, stop bleating about Twitter bots and get on with it",https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/may/17/dear-mr-musk-stop-bleating-about-twitter-bots-and-get-on-with-it
5/18/2022,"Mexican farmers have travelled to London to demand that a FTSE 100 company compensates them for illegal mining on their land and explain violence against anti-mining activists. Penmont mining, a subsidiary of Fresnillo, was ordered by an agrarian court in Mexico in 2013 to pay members of El Bajío community, co-owners of common land in Sonora, north-west Mexico, for the gold extracted and to restore the land to its original state. Having bought shares in Fresnillo, three El Bajío representatives, as well as activists from London Mining Network and London Mexico Solidarity, entered the company’s annual meeting to ask the chairman why it had not complied with the court order and about the kidnapping, disappearance and murder of anti-mining activists. Fresnillo told the Guardian it had complied with the court order by vacating the land and that it had no connection to any violence. Jesús Thomas, one of the co-owners, said after the meeting: “We have spent eight years trying to get justice for our people. There are tonnes of cyanide in the soil, a lot of animals are dead. I made it clear to them [in the meeting] that they are in the wrong. They never said anything in reply, they don’t have any answer. “At least the owners of the company now have the right information to decide whether they are going to do the right thing.” In 2018, two members of El Bajío community – Raúl Ibarra de la Paz and his wife, Noemí López – were killed and disappeared respectively. Last year the president of the community, José de Jesús Robledo Cruz, and his wife, María de Jesús Gómez Vega, were killed and a list of the names of 13 other members who have fought against mining was found next to their bodies. Penmont has previously suggested criminal gangs were to blame for the violence. Fresnillio, which in 2008 became the first Mexican company to list on the London Stock Exchange, made gross profit of $936.9m (£788m) last year, according to its annual report. El Bajío says that between 2010 and 2013 the company extracted 236,709 ounces of gold and removed 10,833,527 tonnes of earth, making profits of about $436m. A spokesperson for Fresnillo said: “Our purpose is to contribute to the wellbeing of people through the sustainable mining of silver and gold. Core to this is how we engage with our local communities and we are proud to have an extensive series of community programmes across our business based on decades of trust and cooperation. “We comply with all laws, in all our markets, at all times and obviously reject immediately any suggestion we are in any way responsible for the tragic deaths of community members. Fresnillo employees themselves have been victim of continued inter-community violence. More specifically, Fresnillo has complied fully with the court order and as a result, vacated 1,824 hectares of land, resulting in the suspension of operations at Soledad-Dipolos since 2013.”",News/Business,Mexican farmers demand redress for illegal mining and violence on their land ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/17/mexican-farmers-demand-redress-for-mining-and-violence-on-their-land
5/18/2022,"At the recent Stormont elections, a majority of voters supported parties that broadly back the Northern Ireland protocol. Local business leaders have urged Boris Johnson to abandon the threat to unilaterally tear parts of it up, which would risk a trade war with the European Union when inflation rates are soaring and recession is looming. Sadly, what is truly best for Northern Ireland has rarely been allowed to disrupt this government’s choreographed games of Brexit brinkmanship with Brussels. Tuesday’s Commons statement on the protocol by the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, was more measured in tone than some of the confrontational briefings around last week. But the tabling of a bill to abandon aspects of a treaty signed less than three years ago – when it was described as “oven-ready” – is irresponsible and recklessly destabilising. Ms Truss airily stated that the proposed legislation would not be in breach of international law, but failed to offer any evidence for that assertion. The EU was swift to warn that whatever legal casuistry may be forthcoming, it could respond to such a move with “all measures at its disposal”, which could mean shelving the entire post-Brexit free trade deal. The government’s disingenuous case is that relations between the British mainland and Northern Ireland have been excessively undermined by the checks, tariffs and regulations insisted upon by the EU. It cites the refusal of the Democratic Unionist party to take up a power-sharing role alongside Sinn Féin as evidence that the Good Friday agreement is being imperilled by unionist discontent. This situation is, of course, directly the result of commitments made by Mr Johnson in 2019, when his priority was to force a hard Brexit. To avoid a north-south hard border on the island of Ireland, Mr Johnson agreed to an effective one in the Irish Sea – betraying a previous promise to the DUP in the process. The Brexiters’ maximalist determination to exit the EU single market meant that there had to be border checks somewhere. That was then, for a government that burns relationships and trust at its own convenience. By now declaring a readiness to abrogate an international agreement, Ms Truss has sent a damaging message to the world that Britain’s word cannot be trusted. She has also needlessly antagonised our main trading partners, risking a downward spiral in relations with the EU at a time of economic crisis. There is an acceptance in Brussels that more flexible implementation of the protocol would be desirable, and a willingness to negotiate. Easements have already been offered, for example in relation to food-related checks and medicines. So why the escalation? The posturing, the grandstanding and the slide to confrontation suggest that familiar Johnsonian dynamics are at play. The DUP remains sceptical that the “nuclear option” of legislation will ever come to pass. But the reopening of the forever Brexit wars constitutes some useful red meat to toss towards backbenchers, as Mr Johnson seeks to ride out Partygate. Ms Truss, who would seek to succeed the prime minister if he falls, may also consider it a good day’s work. Downing Street sources have suggested that Mr Johnson does not, in fact, relish the prospect of a trade war on top of a cost of living crisis. Hopefully – despite this latest episode of Brussels-bashing for the gallery – that assessment will prove to be correct.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Northern Ireland protocol bill: provocative and needless | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/17/the-guardian-view-on-the-northern-ireland-protocol-bill-provocative-and-needless
5/18/2022,"Thirty-six years after the people of the Philippines swept the Marcos family from power in a peaceful popular uprising, they have returned it to the presidency via the ballot box. Last week’s electoral landslide for Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, son of the late dictator, was a shocking and frightening moment for those who survived the violence of his father’s regime and witnessed the plunder of as much as $10bn from the country. The incoming president claimed more than double the votes of his closest opponent, Leni Robredo, a human rights lawyer and the incumbent vice-president. Disinformation (extensive, heavily organised and lucrative for those behind it) has played a crucial role. Across social media, the true history of Ferdinand Marcos Sr’s rule – of torture, executions, debt and economic crisis – has been erased by the lie of a “golden age” of stability and prosperity. At the same time, its members were “celebritised”, with TikTok videos presenting them as an aspirational, influencer-style figures while Mr Marcos Jr sidestepped major debates and tough interviews. Simultaneously came relentless and often misogynistic attacks on Ms Robredo. It is not just that the population is highly technologically literate but often less media literate. There are deeper issues. The People Power revolution of 1986 was unfinished. The political elites remained in place; influential families hold up to 90% of elected positions. Most of the money amassed by Mr Marcos Sr was never recovered, and schools failed to teach the new generations the full story of his rule. The political advance was not matched by social and economic progress; the political dynasties and big conglomerates have ensured that the Philippines remains one of the most unequal societies in Asia. The outgoing president, Rodrigo Duterte, has also contributed. His brutal and erratic authoritarianism – notably a “war on drugs” which has killed thousands, including children – proved popular. He has strengthened the police and army, creating a culture of impunity, while undermining democratic institutions including independent media. He allowed the late dictator to be buried in a cemetery for war heroes, helping to rehabilitate his image. Critically, his daughter Sara Duterte decided not to stand for president, running (successfully) as Mr Marcos Jr’s vice-president. The Philippines must contend with the aftermath of the pandemic: almost a quarter of the nation now live below the poverty line. The country is balancing uneasily between the US and China, with repercussions for the wider region. Mr Marcos Jr has nothing to offer, though some insist that he will not be as ruthless as his father. He has already painted himself as a victim of the press. Other countries should also take heed. As one leading expert on disinformation notes, this success reflects problems seen in many advanced democracies, not just in the global south; Facebook’s public policy director for global elections previously described the Philippines as “patient zero”. Reiterating the truth is not enough. Reaching out to excluded communities and crafting compelling narratives is essential. Ms Robredo’s campaign created real passion at the grassroots, but the efforts came too late. The Marcos family’s return to the top is a triumph of determination and has been a long time in the making. In that respect alone, their opponents – and progressives elsewhere – could learn something from them.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Marcos family’s return: bad news for the Philippines | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/17/the-guardian-view-on-the-marcos-familys-return-bad-news-for-the-philippines
5/18/2022,"Sajid Javid has been warned that thousands of people living with dementia “need to see tangible change now” after he announced a 10-year plan to tackle the condition. The health secretary told delegates at the annual conference of the Alzheimer’s Society his dementia strategy would include a major focus on prevention and research as he promised a “seismic shift” in how the condition is approached. The plan will look at why people fall ill, Javid said, with figures suggesting as much as 40% of dementia is potentially preventable. Javid said he wanted his dementia strategy “to be more ambitious than anything we’ve done before” and suggested the combination of “a visionary plan” and “proper funding” coupled with “care and compassion” would be “unbeatable”. However, it later emerged the plan, which he said he had been developing since last summer, would not be published until later in the year. Figures suggest about 30,000 people with dementia faced delays to getting diagnosed during the Covid-19 pandemic, while a report revealed this week that as many as 325,000 people may be living without a diagnosis. A million people will be living with dementia in the UK by 2025, experts predict, and 1.6 million by 2040. Mark MacDonald, the associate director of advocacy and system change at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: “The secretary of state today spoke of the ‘seismic shift’ needed in dementia diagnosis and care and a bold 10-year plan that gives the UK’s largest killer the attention it needs. “However, his words will mean nothing if not backed by equally ambitious funding and delivery mechanisms which put people with dementia at their heart, and who need to see tangible change now. We have now been waiting more than two years for the promised dementia moonshot to double research funding, which will help us improve care and find a cure. “For too long government action has not matched the scale and impact of dementia. We welcome the secretary of state’s ambitious words today but we must now see this translate quickly into meaningful delivery plans for which ministers should be held accountable.” In his speech to delegates at the conference, Javid said he wanted his dementia plan to be “more ambitious than anything that we’ve ever done before”. He added: “I’d like us to be as bold as we’ve been with our 10 year-plan for cancer.” The health secretary announced a 10-year cancer plan in February, pledging to wage “a national war on cancer” so that “fewer people face the heartache of losing a loved one to this wretched disease”. The plan has yet to be published.",News/Society,Sajid Javid launches 10-year dementia plan vowing ‘seismic shift’ in approach,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/17/sajid-javid-launches-10-year-dementia-plan-vowing-seismic-shift-approach
5/18/2022,"Technology success story Canva is still operating in Russia, making it the only Australian company to earn the lowest grade, “digging in”, on a tracker run by US university Yale and outraging Ukrainians in Australia. The company, which claims to have more than 60 million active users and is worth at least $37bn, continues to allow Russians to use the free version of its product, an online clip art and layout service. Uvi Levitski, a software engineer who is part of an informal group of Ukrainian expatriates who have been monitoring the activities of Australian companies following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, said Canva’s actions were “inconsistent with what we believe an ethical company’s response should have been”. He said some members of the Ukrainian community were considering protesting outside Canva’s offices in the inner-Sydney suburb of Surry Hills. “The Australian Ukrainian diaspora is understandably appalled by Canva’s unprincipled position and the lack of action,” he said. A Russian engagement tracker run by the Chief Executive Leadership Institute at Yale University’s school of management includes six Australian companies – Canva, Atlassian, Viva Energy, law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, Qantas and Rio Tinto. Canva is the only one of the six to draw the “digging in” grade because it is “still providing services to Russia”. The other companies have been labelled either “suspension” or withdrawal”, having either stopped serving the Russian market for the time being or pulled out entirely. Canva’s head of communications, Lachlan Andrews, said the company suspended payments to and from Russia on 1 March. “The free version of Canva remains available in Russia along with a prominent banner displaying our opposition to the war and directing users to our pro-peace and anti-war templates,” he said. He said that the company also included “prominent” banners in its product “highlighting the illegal war in Ukraine” – an approach that he said was likely to result in Canva being banned in Russia. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “However, until then, we believe we have an important responsibility to use our reach, particularly with our 1.4 million users in Russia, to promote truth and accurate information,” he said. Levitski also criticised as “weakly worded” a 4 March blogpost, titled “Supporting Ukraine and Promoting Peace”, in which one of Canva’s founders, Cliff Obrecht, promised the company would donate $1m “to those impacted by this crisis”. While the post refers to an “unlawful and reckless act of aggression”, it does not use the word “invasion” and the word “war” appears only in a sample layout template that Obrecht said Canva was offering for free to “amplify the important call for peace while bringing additional awareness to the tragic situation continuing to unfold”. “We’re also thinking of our Russian community, many of whom are incredibly hurt, upset, and have had no choice in the tragic events that are unfolding,” Obrecht said in the post. Levitski said that polling in Russia showed the vast majority of the population supported the country’s invasion of Ukraine. “It wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that, in the absence of any moderation of private content, the amount of pro-war material made using Canva by users in Russia will similarly outweigh anti-war material, thus disproportionally benefiting the already all-powerful Kremlin propaganda machine,” he said. “And that’s even ignoring the fact that public opposition to the war has been effectively criminalised and is punishable with up to 15 years of imprisonment.” Following inquiries from Guardian Australia, Canva added an update to the blogpost on Tuesday stating that the company is “strongly opposed to the ongoing war in Ukraine and strongly condemn Russia’s continued and illegal acts of aggression”. Canva’s Andrews said the company had “a number of mechanisms in place to prevent Canva from being used for the wrong reason, including proactive content moderation”. “While we haven’t seen any evidence of Canva being used for the wrong reasons, accounts found to be doing so will be immediately blocked,” he said.",News/Australia news,Australian tech company Canva continues operating in Russia in face of Ukrainian outrage,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/australian-tech-company-canva-continues-operating-in-russia-in-face-of-ukrainian-outrage
5/18/2022,"Liane Moriarty is hot property. Screen rights to all nine of her novels have sold – Big Little Lies was given the HBO treatment in 2017, Nine Perfect Strangers became a miniseries in 2021 and several more adaptations are on the way, with A-listers like Nicole Kidman and Blake Lively optioning the remainder of Moriarty’s back catalogue. The rights to the Sydney-born author’s latest novel, Apples Never Fall – released last year – have already been snapped up by London studio Heyday Television. But even outside the small screen, Moriarty’s CV is awe-inspiring: her books have sold over 20m copies worldwide, with Big Little Lies making her the first Australian author to have a novel debut at number one on the New York Times bestseller list. Despite her incredible success, Moriarty is a private person who generally prefers to stay out of the limelight. She will, however, take the stage for a session at Sydney writers’ festival on Sunday 22 May. To keep the page-turners coming, Moriarty commits to writing a new novel every two years (or so). The trick to staying on schedule is an hourglass that she keeps on her desk. Here, she tells us about the romantic appeal of that tool, as well as the story of two other important personal belongings. My father’s ashes. Mainly because I know Dad would be tickled by the idea of me saving his ashes from the ashes. He liked to tell a story of how his friend, a pilot, was hired by a man wanting to scatter a relative’s ashes from an aeroplane. When the sombre moment arrived, the ashes instantly whooshed back into the poor man’s face. My Dad thought that was hilarious. So we won’t be flying his ashes anywhere. For now, they’re just waiting on a side table together with a few keepsakes like his last lift ticket from the snow, a ‘best dad’ gold trophy we once gave him for Father’s Day, one of his old passports that expired in 1985, and a telegram he sent my mother in 1969 after he finally passed his surveying exams. It says: ‘MADE IT AT LAST, REGISTERED SURVEYOR.’ I’d scoop up all those mementoes too, but if things were getting dicey maybe I’d just take the telegram, which is strangely precious to me. The beautiful hourglass that sits on my desk next to my computer. It was a birthday gift from my friend Marisa. I love it because I use it to trick me into writing. The rule is that I have to keep typing – anything at all, even if the words make no sense – until the last grain of sand falls. It helps me lose my sense of self. I know I could set a timer on my phone but where would the romance be in that? When I was four, I was the prideful owner of a beautiful giant marble. My mother said: “Don’t take your beautiful giant marble to preschool, you will lose it.” But I wanted the other kids to envy and covet my marble. So I took it to preschool and lost it. I was heartbroken. I can still see the wondrous swirls of colour contained within its smooth, cool glass. I can also still see the face of the evil little boy who I’m pretty sure stole it. There is a 55-year-old man out there with a dark secret and to him I say: you know who you are and what you did!

5/18/2022,"Gayle Anderson shuffles behind the counter of the Moriac general store, which her grandparents opened in the small town south-west of Melbourne almost a century ago. She comes back with a stack of glossy political flyers that locals have left behind in their postboxes. “Nobody wants them,” Anderson says, thrusting the red, blue, yellow and green pile of shiny faces towards me. But candidates certainly want the voters of Corangamite, one of the most marginal seats in the country. The electorate takes in the west of Geelong, the Bellarine peninsula and the boom surf town of Torquay, as well as more rural areas to the north, including Inverleigh and Bannockburn. It has been subject to a significant redistribution since the 2019 election, cut from more than 5,400 sq km to 1,500 sq km to counteract a huge increase in population. The margin remains 1.1% in favour of the sitting member, Labor’s Libby Coker. Her main challenger is Stephanie Asher, one of the only Liberal candidates in Victoria with a realistic chance of winning a seat from Labor. When Guardian Australia visits the electorate, there is only one prepolling centre open, at a new $13.5m stadium built for the thousands of families moving to housing estates north of Torquay. Asher is there first, doing step-ups on a wooden box near the door of the stadium, in between speaking with voters. Then Coker arrives, politely but firmly displacing a Liberal party volunteer to make sure she is within arms’ reach of Asher. Coker can now get in the ear of early voters first. Asher has to make do with being the last person they see before they go inside. It is a skirmish that illuminates the battle for the seat: every vote bitterly contested, often in hand-to-hand combat. Coker has the vote of Alana Beeson, an associate in a consulting firm who lives in Charlemont, in Geelong’s south-west. Beeson, who cast an early ballot at the stadium, says Coker is a strong local member, and she backs Labor’s commitments to upgrading Barwon Heads Road and the Armstrong Creek town redevelopment, which would improve her young family’s access to sporting facilities. Beeson is less complimentary of the Morrison government. In mismanaging the pandemic response, it failed to follow business management principles she learned in high school, she says. And she does not trust the prime minister. “I’m just sick of the lies coming out of Scott Morrison’s mouth,” Beeson says. Taylor Ibrahim leaves the stadium soon after Beeson. She is still clutching a fistful of how-to-vote cards. She had to navigate about a dozen volunteers on the way in, including one handing out cardboard ukuleles plastered with anti-Morrison messages and urging voters to put Asher last, authorised by Victorian trades hall. Ibrahim, 21, really did not know who to back. The Barwon Heads resident had a few clear priorities though, which she says are common to her and her friends: action on climate change, policy to address student debt, and opposition to vaccination mandates. “Once I’d looked through everything [in the how to vote cards] it was pretty clear,” she said. Coker and Asher continue touting away behind Ibrahim. Sometimes, a voter looks shocked to see them, as if a headshot on a how-to-vote card has magically come to life. In a conversation with Coker punctuated by breaks while she speaks to voters, including some with curly questions such as where, exactly, Labor will get all the nurses it plans to put into aged care, and to volunteers taking her coffee order (white with half a sugar), she says the campaign has gone well, but she is taking nothing for granted. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In the eight elections prior to 2019, Corangamite was won by the party that formed government. Labor has only won the seat five times, but three of those victories have occurred since 2007. That is to say that Corangamite was, until recently, a fairly safe bet for the Coalition, and the party would love to take it back: it has poured tens of millions of dollars into election promises, and the prime minister has visited multiple times during the campaign. “There is pressure, because you know it’s a marginal seat, but I do this because I love what I do,” Coker said. The former journalist, teacher and mayor of the Surf Coast shire council says young families who have moved to the region are interested in Labor’s childcare policy, and climate change, while retirees who have made a sea change are concerned about the aged care sector. The pandemic has shown people why the federal government matters, Coker said, and the people she has spoken to care about the things Labor are campaigning on, including the health and disability sector. Asher, the current City of Greater Geelong mayor (she has taken leave to contest the election), is running a campaign that is unashamedly more local than Coker’s, as she feels the influx of people to the region means the most important issue to voters is “the lag in community infrastructure”. So she has pitched $20m for a pool here, $10m to remodel a couple of surf clubs there, and even a few tens of thousands of dollars to upgrade scoreboards at sporting grounds. Asher agrees with a suggestion that most of those responsibilities generally lie with local and state governments, but insists these are the issues people raise with her. She denies a local campaign helps distance her from Morrison, who is not as popular in Victoria as in other states. “He’s been down here four times now, I haven’t done any distancing,” she said. “Whenever he comes down, we say that’s great. “It’s a local campaign because that’s what people are concerned about. Ninety-five per cent of the issues are state and local responsibilities.” North-east of the stadium, above the sea of Colorbond and concrete pockmarking the outskirts of Torquay, and over the Barwon River, John Chisholm is walking down the main street of Ocean Grove, killing time before a haircut appointment. He moved to the region five years ago having previously lived in Melbourne’s south-east in the seat of Goldstein, another electorate expected to be tight this election. Chisholm says it is always a quandary considering whether to vote based on who is the best local member, or on who you would prefer as prime minister. But after the second debate (“one-and-a-half hours of my life I won’t get back”) he felt that the performance of both prospective leaders could push more voters to the Greens or teal independents. “If more independents get into the House of Representatives I certainly don’t see it as a bad thing, to be honest,” he said. “The Liberal party has moved further to the right, the teals are more centrist.” Chisholm, a semi-retired lawyer, says he supports a federal anti-corruption commission and strong action on climate change. He says that although “short-termism” dominates politics, there are certain truths that had to be faced up to. In the same way as logging and fishing had diminished as industries because of the damage they caused to the environment, he said, so too must a reckoning come for coalmining and the use of fossil fuels. “In the last few years I’ve started to think more about the state of the environment I am leaving behind for my children and grandchildren,” Chisholm said. “I’m ashamed to say we didn’t do enough.” Climate change is also front of mind for Taylah Stolk, who is making coffees in a cafe along the main drag of Inverleigh. Ocean Grove and other towns on the Bellarine peninsula are well-known tourist haunts with populations that have been growing since SeaChange hit TV screens in the late 1990s. Inverleigh, to the north and west, is a historic town largely supporting nearby farms, that has only recently seen a significant increase in population. Unlike Chisholm, Stolk has not been closely following federal politics. At 20, it is also the first time she will vote, and while she is uncertain which party will have her support, the environment is her main focus. “It’s hard to conceptualise how much your vote actually matters,” she said. “I’m only young, and I don’t want to see [the planet] all decline before my kids get to my age.” Sitting at a table outside, local Victoria Guthridge and her friend Terhi Meek, who lives just outside Corangamite in the nearby town of Shelford, have been discussing the election when we intervene. Meek is originally from Finland but recently became an Australian citizen, meaning she is about to vote in the country for the first time. She has been struck by the negativity of federal political campaigning, compared with her homeland. Guthridge watched the final debate between Morrison and Labor leader Anthony Albanese the previous night, and said it was “typical” that the prime minister “could not help himself” to have a go at his opponent even when asked to say something nice. The policies of the Morrison government do not address what Guthridge considers important: climate change, making the childcare system cheaper, strengthening the healthcare system, improving how women in politics are treated and broader gender inequality, and introducing a federal anti-corruption commission. As a nurse, she said she had a clear interest in the labour movement as it had increased her wages, but that tax cuts proposed by the Coalition would leave her family better off. “On the whole his government would probably personally benefit us, but we don’t need those tax cuts as much as others need them.” Gayle Anderson’s general store sits at the junction of two major roads and a railway line, about halfway between Inverleigh and Torquay. Only two booths recorded a higher percentage of votes for the Liberal party than Moriac last election, and both of those polling places handled significantly fewer ballots.

Anderson is selling the business, which had several owners after it was founded and before she took over, and her experience of the pandemic will shape her vote. A longtime conservative voter, she had a “nightmare” dealing with what she called the “ludicrous” restrictions implemented by the state Labor government, but had also lost faith with the Liberal party nationally. She plans to vote Liberal Democrat. “I’m not happy with the way [the Coalition] are running the country, but I’ll be putting them before Labor,” Anderson said. “The Greens get nothing.”",News/Australia news,Bitter battle for every vote: can million-dollar promises bring a sea change to Corangamite?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/bitter-battle-for-every-vote-can-million-dollar-promises-bring-a-sea-change-to-corangamite
5/18/2022,"Remember the old friendship trope “if we’re both single when we’re older, let’s get married” seen in films like My Best Friend’s Wedding? The modern version of that seems to be “if we’re both homeless when we’re older, let’s live in our cars”. Or more realistically: when, not if. As property prices and costs of living continue their upward trajectory and wage growth remains stagnant – or even slipping downward – more of these conversations pop up among friends. One friend and I recently discussed the logistics of this, laughing so hard there were tears (severe stress will do that to a person). We have it all sorted: two hatchbacks, boots popped open and connected at the rear, creating a sort of adult fort. All we need is a disco ball. Party’s at our place, folks, as long as everyone brings snacks and a disregard for personal space. On a personal level it’s fascinating (another word for horrifying) how quickly this reality has shifted from my original plan when I was in my early 20s. Back then, I thought a Golden Girls-esque share house could be an option for some of us: we’d look after each other! Eat cheesecake together! I’d throw in a witty and disparaging remark every so often (I’m a Dorothy at heart). But older women are the fastest-growing cohort of homeless Australians and that’s been the case for the last several years. The odds of any of us owning a home, let alone one with multiple bedrooms, is almost as laughable as the time the Golden Girls accidentally booked accommodation at a nude resort. (I have never seen another television show.) This is not to make light or minimise the bleak reality. As a social worker I met many people who spent each night trying to find a place to sleep that was warm and dry and I did not come from wealth so have always been acutely aware of this being a possibility in my future. There is a housing crisis nationwide as public and private options for a roof over one’s head all seem impossible, and was summed up pretty well by a Newcastle gentleman last month during a visit from the PM. When I feel uncharacteristically optimistic or taken by a flight of fancy, I will search property listings for tiny one-bedroom flats. Even my fantasies are cloaked in reality as I slide the price filter almost entirely to the left, closer to exactly zero than six of them. If I’ve had a knock-off pint I might indulge in selecting to view only properties with a balcony. After multiple lockdowns I have a newfound appreciation for air, one of the few remaining resources that doesn’t yet cost me money. But I dare not ask for a back yard – who do I think I am, the Queen of England? Most listings begin with a description such as “A wonderful investment to add to your portfolio!” and the shock propels me backwards. Once I scoop myself off the pre-stained carpet of my rental, I wonder: has this website mistaken me for some sort of property developer? I continue searching. “A must-see for any savvy investor!” Even the language around home ownership has morphed into a complete acceptance that chances are, anyone looking to buy is already in the market. Homes are not a human right but an opportunity for investment. The rich get richer, the poor live in hatchbacks (if they have one). So why do we make these silly jokes about disco balls and car parties? To survive, I guess, and to conserve energy to keep fighting. A sense of complete abandonment from our leaders is not new to many people during these last few years of the pandemic, and particularly not new to people who are well-equipped in living with disadvantage and inequality. I’m grateful to have friendships that contain a mutual understanding that we won’t let the other one slip off the radar. Our (car) door is always open.

5/18/2022,"For some years, Yorta Yorta man Jason Tamiru’s job was to help secure “thousands of bones, hundreds of people” from museums, institutions and private collectors around the world. As a cultural heritage officer for Indigenous nations in north-west Victoria, Tamiru would organise burial ceremonies and inter the remains back on Country. “It’s a duty, mate,” says the theatre director. “A role I took on with honour.” The bones of children and babies “hit you right in the soul and the spirit”, he says. He vividly recalls the return of perhaps the most widely known Indigenous infant: the “Jaara baby”, originally buried in the hollow of a tree in the mid-19th century near the town of Charlton. Wrapped in possum skins, the baby was reportedly discovered in 1904 by an axeman felling timber. It wasn’t until almost a century later, in 2003, that the Melbourne Museum returned the remains to the Dja Dja Wurrung people. “We put the baby back into a tree, back on Country, including all its belongings,” says Tamiru. The baby was wrapped in a new possum skin cloak and given a new rattle. Traditional tree burials are “very sacred” and reburying the bones of ancestors reconnects cultural lines by “absolutely awakening those spirits”, he says. But the remains of thousands more ancestors are still being sought by Indigenous nations across Australia, despite the existence of a federally funded program for more than 30 years to repatriate them from collections in Australia and across the world. Their bodies ended up in universities, medical schools and in the hands of private collectors across the US, UK and Europe, but museums cannot be forced to return human remains. In Australia, more than 2,850 ancestors have been returned to custodianship of their communities, but the eight museums involved in the Indigenous repatriation program since 1990 still hold about 10,500 First Nations ancestral remains. The South Australian Museum alone collected the remains of about 4,600 mostly Indigenous people. It is “heartbreaking” for First Nations people when their ancestors’ remains are withheld, says Tamiru, whose experiences in repatriation inform a new play, The Return, which Tamiru is directing at Melbourne’s Malthouse theatre as part of the Rising festival. “Institutions labelled us with letters and numbers and dehumanised us. When we connected with these places, we humanised the people they had in there.” “It was a massive industry at the beginning of colonisation, snatching people we had laid to rest from their graves. This place was a goldmine for collectors and grave robbers. There was good money to be made from this business. A lot of people, especially those mad scientists, they believed we [Indigenous people] weren’t going to be here today, and they wanted to get as much information as they could. They were fascinated about who we are, where we come from, and they saw us as the missing link to history.” When the Jaara baby was returned to the Dja Dja Wurrung for reburial in 2003, a former Melbourne Museum curator, the anthropologist Alan West, wrote a scathing memo in which he objected to the return of the remains when cataloguing was still incomplete: “The action is referred to as repatriation, but this term is really a smokescreen to hide the museum’s facilitation of unashamed vandalism,” he wrote. In 2006, the Victorian government mandated the Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Council as a statutory authority to oversee Indigenous cultural heritage, including strong legal protection for Aboriginal human remains within the state. “It’s all about museums and us forming true relationships, so they can put connections to what they have,” says Tamiru. “Once people have that human connection, they become a bit softer, much more open in handing back. Some institutions are still living in the dark ages; they question who owns this information, they question who owns this piece of mankind. They don’t understand this is actually part of our family, and we need to get them back home.” Tamiru approached playwright John Harvey, who is of Saibai Island (Torres Strait) and English descent, to write The Return. The pair first met years ago when Tamiru was producing Deadly Funny, a platform he created for Indigenous standup comedians. It wasn’t until years later that Harvey learned Tamiru had helped bring ancestral remains back home. “I thought, ‘Wow, that is massive’,” Harvey says. “I can’t imagine how tough that must be as an Indigenous man to work and walk in that space.” Harvey says the greatest challenge in writing The Return, which takes place over two centuries and interweaves three narratives – a bone collector, a museum creator and a repatriation officer – was to make clear, as per Tamiru’s wishes, that this was not one person’s story but rather the story of many. As he learned while researching, the emotional impact is deepened when you know that one body might be shared among anthropologists and anatomists in disparate institutions, using different filing systems. One ancestor’s bones might be scattered between Edinburgh and Washington, to meet the historical “thirst” of anthropologists and anatomists. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning And even if the remains are found, or finally gathered together from across the world, “there’s a lot of deep research and resources that have to go into finding out the provenance of remains”, Harvey says. In January, the Australian government announced that it would build a new cultural precinct known as Ngurra – a word meaning home, belonging and place of inclusion – which will be dedicated to returned remains whose provenance is unknown and who therefore cannot be reburied on their own Country. Indigenous actors, including Jimi Bani, Ghenoa Gela and Guy Simon, each play several roles in The Return, including non-Indigenous characters; Tamiru says he cast only First Nations actors to “challenge stereotypes” of who gets represented on stage. The western paternalistic idea of ownership of Indigenous bodies endures, says Tamiru, but he senses growing support from museums and politicians. “People are starting to learn and understand and educate themselves about our history, about who we are in our identity,” he says. “Through that maturity they understand there is a history here, and a culture, and there are some ghosts in the history that are now awakened and need to be put to bed.” The Return opens at the Malthouse’s Merlyn theatre on 18 May, in Melbourne. The Rising festival begins on 1 June.",Arts/Stage,‘We need to get them back home’: the fight to bury Aboriginal remains kept in museums,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/18/we-need-to-get-them-back-home-the-fight-to-bury-aboriginal-remains-kept-in-museums
5/18/2022,"Last Monday morning, two weeks before election day, journalists in Toowoomba began calling and emailing the Labor candidate for the seat of Groom, Gen Allpass, to ask whether she supported the expansion of the controversial New Acland coalmine. “I had all the media after me that day, and some online trolling as well,” Allpass said. The calls were prompted by a press release sent by the “Friends of New Acland Coal Mine”, which claimed to be a “4,000-strong member organisation”. The statement, headed “Does the Labour [sic] candidate for Groom support New Acland Stage 3?”, sought to put pressure Allpass to publicly state her position on the New Acland expansion. It had no contact phone number and instead directed newsrooms to an email address and Facebook page. There has been no response to Guardian Australia’s questions sent to the email address. Guardian Australia reported in 2018 that the same Facebook page was at the time moderated by the head of media and communications of the mine’s foreign-owned parent company, New Hope Group. A 2018 report by the Australia Institute claimed the page was part of an “astroturfing” campaign by New Hope which was “designed to superficially appear like grassroots community-led organising rather than orchestrated commercial marketing”. “To the casual observer, these online groups appear to show a great deal of community-led organisation but are actually run by New Hope Group to give the impression of widespread public support for their [expansion].” New Hope Group was contacted but did not respond to questions. The Friends of New Acland Mine statement claims the group is “a 4,000-member strong community group comprising of farmers, landholders, families, business owners and community members”. The claim of 4,000 members appears to relate to the number of followers of the Friends of New Acland Mine Facebook page. The page’s privacy settings obscure a complete list of followers, but 19 “top fans” who are most active on the page are able to be viewed by the public. Of these top fans, more than half do not appear to live in the local area. Four appear to be New Hope employees, including one who lives in Brisbane. Guardian Australia attempted to ask the group about its funding and membership, including whether it could back up the claim of 4,000 community “members”, but received no response. Paul King, the secretary of the Oakey Coal Action Alliance – a local group campaigning against the expansion – said he believed that the Friends of New Acland Mine was “masquerading as a genuine community organisation”. The Friends of New Acland Mine page has previously run paid advertisements on Facebook criticising Labor politicians. These were taken down by Facebook because they were posted “without a disclaimer”. Some of those advertisements link to a website that was registered by New Hope Group. The Australian Electoral Commission said it “does not regulate the content of political messages” such as press releases and that Friends of New Acland Mine was not a disclosure entity that would require an authorisation on its statements. The statement released last Monday by Friends of New Acland mine was followed by print and television media coverage of federal election candidates’ support for the mine expansion. On Tuesday, the group released another statement, “seeking clarity” about whether the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, supports the mine expansion. Allpass said she refused to play the game – approvals being sought for the New Acland mine were a matter for the state government. The Labor candidate said she visited the New Acland site a few weeks ago but was surprised at the attempt by the Facebook group to pressure her to publicly support the mine expansion. “I’ve never ever seen anything else from that group other than that,” she said. “Had they wanted to come and have a conversation, they could have at any stage done that.”",News/Australia news,‘Community’ group linked to mining company New Hope presses ALP candidate on coalmine support,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/community-group-linked-to-mining-company-new-hope-presses-alp-candidate-on-coalmine-support
5/18/2022,"Victoria has recorded more cases of the flu so far this year than the whole of 2020 and 2021 combined, with experts calling for the voluntary wearing of masks in settings where there is a high chance of spreading influenza and Covid. At a time Covid-19 infections remain stubbornly high, the latest data from the Victorian health department shows there have been 5,023 reported cases of the flu in the state since the start of 2022. This is compared to 110 in 2021 and 4,792 in 2020, when international borders were closed and Covid restrictions were in place. Flu cases, however, remain lower than they were at the beginning of the severe 2019 flu season. The president of the Victorian branch of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Roderick McRae, said the state’s coming flu season would probably be worse than the previous two years, given restrictions had eased and there had been a lack of exposure to the virus. “It’s everywhere and it’s being spread by going to birthday parties, by going to the footy, by going to a show, and we’re being encouraged to do exactly that,” he said. Covid-19 infections also remain steady, with new daily cases in Victoria rising above 10,000 for eight consecutive days. On Tuesday, the state recorded 13,654 new infections and 20 deaths, while there are more than 500 people in hospital with the virus. McRae said a further surge in Covid cases, combined with a bad flu season, could put incredible pressure on the state’s hospitals, which are already suffering with overcrowding and ambulance ramping at emergency departments. “The public hospital system is in crisis right now,” he said. “Staff don’t like it, they’re putting in unpaid overtime, they’re unhappy and they’re sad that they can’t do the job to the best of their ability. Yet we continuing to add more pressure to the front end of the system by more people contracting Covid-19 or influenza.” The AMA in Victoria is recommending a return to mask use in settings where there is a high risk of transmission, such as large sporting events, movie theatres, concert halls, restaurants and public transport. “It’s just about being sensible,” McRae said. “AMA Victoria is not calling for a mandate, that’s the government’s call, but the entire community should be thinking about whether it wants to completely block the public hospital system and its ability to support everybody.” In Victoria, masks are currently required on public transport, in taxis and rideshares, at airports and in health, aged care and justice setttings. The government strongly recommends people wear them when in places where they cannot physically distance, are in contact with vulnerable people or if they have Covid-19 symptoms. Prof Adrian Esterman, an epidemiologist and biostatistician at the University of South Australia, welcomed AMA Victoria’s intervention, having been a critic of the decision to remove mask mandates in mid-April. “[Covid-19] is still circulating in huge numbers and it’s making people sick – some with long-term health conditions – and it’s killing people,” Esterman said. “What the government is saying is the number of deaths and number of people with long Covid-19 doesn’t really matter, because we’ve got to learn to live with it. You tell that to the bereaved families. You tell that to the people who now have to lose their job because they can’t work any more.” Esterman said masks were one of the few public health interventions that could reduce Covid-19 transmission without affecting the economy. On Tuesday the premier, Daniel Andrews, said the health minister had no advice to change the state’s restrictions. He urged Victorians to get vaccinated against both Covid-19 and the flu. “Let’s try to take some of the pressure off our nurses by having less of those Covid and flu cases,” Andrews said. Meanwhile, students in Victorian schools will no longer have to do twice-weekly rapid antigen tests from Monday 23 May. Schools began notifying parents of the change this week, with only students who are household contacts of positive cases and those who have symptoms required to continue testing. Free rapid antigen tests will continue to be available at schools.",News/Australia news,Calls for mask-wearing as Victoria flu cases exceed past two seasons combined,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/calls-for-mask-wearing-as-victoria-flu-cases-exceed-past-two-seasons-combined
5/18/2022,"Nicky Hungerford is casting her vote for the marginal north Queensland seat of Leichhardt all the way from Timor-Leste thanks to the intervention of a “mystery man”. Hungerford is among tens of thousands of Australians overseas who have scrambled to get their hands on – or are still anxiously awaiting the arrival of – their ballot on the eve of an election at which many want their voices heard more than ever. Once a straightforward task of turning up to an embassy or consulate on polling day, voting for many expats and travellers has been thrown into chaos at this election, after the decision of the Australian Electoral Commission to scrap in-person booths in dozens of places around the world, from Nuku’alofa in Tonga to Washington DC in the US. The Labor party’s international network says that amounted to 67 polling booths being cut, which is a decision the AEC says it took based on the locations’ “real and potential Covid environment” and ones that “had to be made early”. “As a result of a once-in-one-hundred-year pandemic, some voters who had previously voted in person at a diplomatic mission, will have to complete a postal vote at this event,” the AEC says. Nineteen locations will still offer in-person voting. On its social media accounts, the AEC says more than 50,000 Australians overseas have applied for a postal vote. A spokesperson says it had given overseas voters “plenty of notice”, reaching out “as early as November last year to flag changes”. Yet the decision still caught many by surprise. Hungerford voted at the last two elections from Timor-Leste and had assumed she would “rock up at the embassy” in Dili once again. Thankfully, a friend of a friend of a friend picked up the ABC broadcast, which carried the news that this would not be the case in 2022. But the AEC’s offer of home delivery of postal votes has done little to reassure Hungerford. “We only got street names in [parts of] Dili about three years ago, and we’ve got no street numbers,” she says. “So I don’t know how a delivery driver would find you.” Instead of waiting to find out, the aid worker turned to the Dili grapevine for help. Hungerford’s friend is arranging for another person to bring over their ballot and Hungerford has just enough time to have hers sent to his Melbourne home.

Norman has also voted several times before from Dili, once travelling five hours from the remote mountains to the capital to cast her vote. The octogenarian describes herself as a full-time activist and proudly claims to be the first person arrested for protesting against coal seam gas extraction in Australia. But after only applying for a postal vote on Monday, Norman fears she may have left it too late to receive her ballot in time. She would have acted sooner, but only found out about the changes thanks to word of mouth. It is not only older voters, however, who are sweating on the arrival of their ballots.

Lewis received a letter on 15 April from the AEC confirming she enrolled as an overseas voter yet, as of Tuesday afternoon, “no ballot ever came”. For many living overseas, the last two years have driven home the impact of politics on their daily lives. Melanie Layugan, 31, an English teacher living in Tokyo, says the issues she cares most about are student debt and housing. Layugan is enrolled to vote in the most marginal seat in the country, Macquarie. In 2019, Labor won it by just 371 votes. As of Tuesday afternoon, Layugan has yet to receive her ballot. “I’m really nervous that it’s not going to arrive,” she says. “I guess I just actually care about what the country’s going to be when I come back.”",News/Australia news,Axing of overseas voting booths leaves many Australians stressing over postal ballots,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/axing-of-overseas-voting-booths-leaves-many-australians-stressing-over-postal-ballots
5/18/2022,"Surveys consistently show that aged care, climate change and education are among voters’ top concerns this federal election. But you wouldn’t necessarily know it by watching politicians’ press conferences or reading some media coverage. A Guardian Australia analysis of election issues shows that while voters’ number one issue of cost of living has been given significant political and media attention, other issues that voters care about appear to have been neglected. The disconnect is stark on aged care and education. Aged care is ranked second most important by voters, but scored much lower in terms of the leaders’ releases, media coverage and questions at press conferences. The early weeks of the campaign were also punctuated with so-called “gotcha” questions from journalists, such as Anthony Albanese being asked to name the cash rate and unemployment rate. While the “gotcha” question might lead to headlines, how well they serve voters is questionable, and it’s possible that coverage of “gaffes” leaves less room for coverage of actual policy and topics voters genuinely care about when making the important decision on who to vote for. This raises the question: given we know from polling what voters’ most important election issues are, how do these issues rank in terms of media coverage, and how often are the leaders asked about these topics? To assess the disconnect, Guardian Australia compared the results of an ANU survey on voters’ priority policy areas with how much coverage they were given in the media, how often they featured in journalists’ questions to Albanese and Morrison, and how frequently these topics featured in Liberal and Labor leaders’ media releases and in the Facebook posts of major party candidates during the first three and a half weeks of the campaign. While the original data uses the proportion of ANU survey respondents who listed it as their top priority and the percentage of text for each source that contains keywords for that issue, we have converted these figures to rankings to allow for easier comparison. There was not an exact match for many of the issues identified by ANU respondents. The closest match was used (where there was one), otherwise the topic was left blank. Media coverage results are based on Streem data. One of the biggest discrepancies between voter priorities and political attention relates to aged care. More than 60% of respondents to the ANU survey put aged care as a top priority, but it was the subject of less than 2% of the questions in leaders’ press conferences. That’s despite aged care being one of Labor’s major policy platforms going into the campaign. It also ranked 14th in terms of media coverage, with only 3% of news stories having keywords relating to aged care. There was also a wide gap between how highly voters ranked education and how much focus it has received from the media and politicians during the campaign. While more than 50% of people put education as a top priority, it was the subject of less than 1% of journalists’ questions to the two major party leaders. Neither party appears to be making education a focus – issuing fewer media releases related to education than employment, regional Australia, and the budget. Cost of living is one issue everyone is focused on. Of the ANU survey respondents, 64.7% ranked it as a top priority – the most of any issue – and it has received a large amount of media attention. While it didn’t feature as highly as some other topics in media releases, it is more prominent in politicians’ Facebook posts. Climate change features more highly than people might expect, but this is in part due to the Coalition’s messaging on emissions reduction technology, with green hydrogen hubs and related projects featuring in media releases. The one topic area that dominated questions from journalists but doesn’t appear as much in other areas is foreign policy – this is in part due to many questions on Australia’s relationship with China, which is not included in the keywords used for the media coverage data. However, both defence and foreign policy topics were ranked as a lower priority in the ANU survey. Almost a third of questions, or 31%, asked at Albanese and Morrison’s press conferences during the first three and a half weeks of the campaign were about politics itself such as polling, leadership issues, election dates, relationships with premiers. About 5% of the questions could be described as “gotchas”, or follow-ups to previous gotchas (with the caveat that this is a tricky category to define). For comparison, just 3% of the questions were about climate change, Covid or housing. Coverage of the “gaffes” following some of these “gotcha” questions has been uneven as well, with Albanese featuring far more prominently than Morrison. Here, we’ve compared the number of news articles matching search terms relating to four “gaffes”: Albanese being unable to state the correct unemployment and cash rate, Albanese not listing the six points of Labor’s NDIS plan, Morrison getting the JobSeeker payment rate wrong, and Morrison saying he was “blessed” to have children without disability: While this includes duplication of articles across multiple publications, the difference in coverage for each leader’s mistakes is stark. Media monitoring firm Streem analysed over 153,000 published media stories between 10 April and 5 May using keyword searches to identify published media stories relating to topics in the campaign. Guardian Australia used those same keywords (available here) to search campaign press releases by the party leaders and over 15,000 Facebook posts scraped for our Pork-o-meter. Transcripts of press conferences and doorstop interviews by Morrison and Albanese from the start of the campaign were scraped from their respective websites, and the text split into questions and answers. Over a thousand questions were identified and manually classified as “gotcha” or not, and placed into one of 30 categories.",News/News,How often do voters’ top concerns feature at election campaign press conferences and in the media?,https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2022/may/18/how-often-do-voters-top-concerns-feature-at-election-campaign-press-conferences-and-in-the-media
5/18/2022,"Australia has fared better than many countries throughout much of the pandemic, but despite high vaccination rates and the availability of antiviral treatments, people are still dying every day and case numbers are rising. Vaccination means few people are becoming significantly unwell, but the virus can still take a toll, and ongoing outbreaks mean health and other essential services, and businesses are struggling to find staff. Now, two years into the pandemic, can Australia still say it is faring well against Covid? Australia had tough restrictions in place throughout much of last year. While other countries were lifting restrictions and dealing with rapid Covid-19 spread, Australia took the approach of waiting for high vaccination rates before easing key restrictions. “Last year, where the rest of the world was facing constant huge numbers, of course, we kept the numbers down,” Australian Medical Association president Dr Omar Khorshid said. “I don’t think the fact that we have very high numbers now is evidence of failing to manage the pandemic, but our different approach is simply having a predictable consequence. When restrictions lift, cases go up.” Australia’s spread, however, is occurring in an environment where 95% of people aged 16 and over have had at least two vaccine doses. Not including small islands, Australia now has the highest number of per-capita Covid-19 infections. But the Doherty Institute’s Sharon Lewin, a professor of medicine and an infectious diseases physician and one of the experts at the forefront of the national effort against the pandemic, said comparing case numbers between countries is now “meaningless”. There are so many differences between countries in how they test for the virus, who they test, and whether tests are reported to health authorities, she said. Australia requires positive rapid antigen test (RAT) results to be reported to state or territory health authorities, and is still encouraging PCR testing. “Many countries do not count RAT testing, including the US where you are not obliged to report a positive RAT test,” Lewin said. “In Australia, two-thirds of our cases are detected by RAT testing. So when people say Australia has the highest number of cases in the world that data is meaningless. “What we can do is track changes over time within Australia, and we see those numbers are steadily increasing as we head towards winter. “We need more regular testing to accurately detect the case positivity rate, and we need a far higher awareness about how to protect people at most risk of hospitalisation and death”. A key form of protection now available includes antiviral drugs, Lewin said. Advanced age and underlying vulnerability have contributed to high death rates, especially among Australians aged over 70. Lewin said those ending up in hospital with Covid are “largely either unvaccinated, or haven’t had their booster, or have co-morbidities”. “We know those populations benefit from antiviral drugs, but they have to access them largely within the first five days of symptoms,” she said. “We need a much, much bigger awareness campaign that antivirals help, antivirals are available, and that they prevent people from ending up in hospital.” Australia has access to antibody treatments that, when administered early after symptom onset, can prevent severe disease and hospitalisation. These have been available for Covid-19 longer than the newer antiviral drugs. But these treatments do not work effectively against the currently circulating Covid-19 variants. They also require an infusion and need to be administered in a hospital. “We are constantly chasing our tails with antibodies, whereas far more effective are the two newer oral antiviral drugs, which so far, have not been impacted by the variants of concern,” Lewin said.

Paxlovid, the other antiviral, reduces this risk by 80%. For GPs to prescribe a drug it needs to be on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Molnupiravir has been on the PBS from March. Paxlovid was only listed on 1 May. “Paxlovid is far more effective,” Lewin said. “The downside is it is more complicated to prescribe. It interacts with other drugs so you need a lot of support for GPs prescribing it to allow them to work out those drug interactions safely. “My concern is that many people at high risk of disease progression and hospitalisation may not even know about these antivirals or even think to go to the doctor if they test positive. “We must put a lot more effort into making sure anyone eligible knows about them, and can access them easily.” Lewin said hospitals also need to better collect and report data from all Covid-19 deaths, including what co-morbidities that person had and whether they were offered antivirals early. Rapid antigen tests work best when several tests are administered consecutively over several days. A one-off test is much less accurate. “If you have been exposed and have symptoms and your RAT test is negative, I would recommend you have a PCR test anyway as we know it’s a more sensitive test,” Lewin said. “If you really do have Covid and you test daily with a RAT test throughout your illness it will eventually show a positive; it is very unusual that it will stay negative throughout the course of the illness.” However, RATs are expensive and this option may not be financially feasible, so a PCR test is recommended when symptoms are present. “Of course someone may also have something else other than Covid,” Lewin said. “We know influenza cases are rising as we head into winter. I think it is still important to know for sure though whether you have Covid or not. Because once you know you will act differently to protect yourself and others.” The US has hit 1 million deaths, the highest death toll of any country. Australia has reached 7,800 deaths, but Lewin said this does not mean Australia can become complacent. As well as better awareness of early treatments, and better data collection and integration, Lewin said continuous promotion of the third booster shot is critical. Khorshid said the federal government – whoever is elected come the weekend – must commit to funding 50% of the rise in costs of running hospitals. The federal government has boosted its hospital spend, but this is due to end in September and was a measure to take hospitals through the pandemic. But Khorshid said the pandemic won’t be over in September and the entire hospital system is under strain. “The impact of Covid on the health system is ongoing because the pandemic is certainly not over,” he said. “Even if we don’t see another severe variant and we learn to live with the virus in a way that we’re currently learning.”",News/Australia news,Why are Australia’s Covid case rates still so high and how can we prevent more deaths?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/why-are-australias-covid-case-rates-still-so-high-and-how-can-we-prevent-more-deaths
5/18/2022,"Labor maintains an advantage over the Coalition but as the 2022 election campaign enters its final days the contest has tightened in Scott Morrison’s favour, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. Labor has a two-point lead in the poll’s two-party preferred “plus” measure with the opposition on 48% and the Coalition on 46%. Seven per cent of respondents are undecided. A fortnight ago, Labor was ahead of the Coalition 49% to 45% with 6% undecided. The Coalition’s primary vote is on 36%, one point ahead of Labor (35%), with the Greens on 9% (down one point in a fortnight). One Nation is on 4% (up one point), with independents on 6% (up one point) and the United Australia party on 3% (down one point). All these movements are inside the poll’s margin of error which is plus or minus 3%. Guardian Essential’s voting intention figures now express the head-to-head metric of the major party contest as two-party preferred “plus”, rather than the standard two-party preferred measure. This change in methodology, adopted after the 2019 election, highlights the proportion of undecided voters in any survey, providing readers with more accuracy on the limits of any prediction. The normal polling cycle was extended to cover this past weekend to capture the fallout from the Liberal party’s offical campaign launch on Sunday and the political wash-up on Monday – and to provide a larger sample for the final opinion survey of the campaign. The sample size of the latest survey was 1,600 voters. As the campaign enters the final days, in two-party preferred “plus” terms, Labor is tracking ahead of the Coalition with voters under the age of 54, with women, with inner-city voters, and with voters in all states except Queensland, where the Coalition has a significant electoral buffer because of large anti-Labor swings during the 2019 election. While women are more inclined to support Anthony Albanese than Morrison, and Liberal MPs in metropolitan contests report that many professional women express a visceral dislike of the prime minister, the trend in the Guardian Essential data suggests women aged 18-34 have been drifting towards the Coalition and the Greens for some months, with that trend accelerating since February. The Coalition is polling ahead of Labor with voters over the age of 55, with men, Queenslanders, and voters living in the outer suburbs and in rural areas. Morrison has trained his election messaging on those voting cohorts, generating speculation about whether he has abandoned moderate Liberals facing off against teal independents in an attempt to flip Labor seats in the regions and outer suburbs. Morrison last week attempted a bold reboot of his political fortunes, promising to overhaul his abrasive leadership style if voters granted him another term. He then used Sunday’s campaign launch to promise first home buyers the opportunity to use their own retirement savings as a deposit – a development many analysts said would drive up house prices further. While the policy is controversial, Morrison’s super-for-homes scheme has sparked a fight with Labor as the two leaders conduct a final blitz of marginal electorates in the countdown to polling day on Saturday, and the pledge changed the conversation from stagnant wages, which is more fraught territory for the Coalition. Albanese will use a National Press Club address on Wednesday to make his final national pitch to undecided voters. Australians are currently prepolling in record numbers. Labor will release its final policy costings on Thursday. The final Guardian Essential survey of the campaign shows Morrison’s approval with Australian voters remains in negative territory, with 49% of the sample disapproving of his performance while 43% approve. More voters approve of the Labor leader than disapprove, but that assessment is line ball, with 42% of the sample approving and 41% disapproving of Albanese. A majority of respondents (59%) believe Albanese will be declared the winner on Saturday night with only 41% tipping the Coalition. That’s a three-point shift from a fortnight ago, when 56% of the sample thought Labor would win and 44% the Coalition. Morrison remains ahead of Albanese in the survey’s better prime minister measure, but only just. The prime minister is rated by 40% of respondents on this metric and Albanese by 37%, with 23% saying they don’t know. Almost half of the Guardian Essential sample (49%) believes it is time to change the government. Only 32% of respondents favour the status quo, while 18% remain unsure. More voters believe the country is currently on the wrong track (42%) than the right track (40%) but 18% of respondents are unsure. Two questions were formulated for poll respondents this week referencing the major messages of the Albanese and Morrison campaigns. A majority of respondents say the country needs a government prepared to face up to the big problems the nation is facing (66%) – which is a proxy for the Labor leader’s messaging – while 34% say the country needs a safe pair of hands to lead Australia through uncertain times – a proposition referencing Morrison’s risk messaging. A majority of respondents (68%) say they would prefer to vote for a political party that has better policies for the country (compared to 66% a fortnight ago), with 19% of the sample more focused on the leader. And a majority of respondents (66%) believe this election is “very important” for the future direction of the country, with 31% saying somewhat important.",News/Australia news,Essential poll: Labor remains in lead but race tightens after Liberal party election campaign launch,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/essential-poll-labor-remains-in-lead-but-race-tightens-after-liberal-party-election-campaign-launch
5/18/2022,"After suffering a couple of bleak pandemic years, cafe owner Adam Wang is relieved to see students, workers and tourists strolling through Brisbane’s Queen Street mall. His two cafes – Coffee Anthology and The Maillard Project – had been on life support during the peak of the Covid crisis, with his staff on jobkeeper and his businesses receiving support from the local council. As his businesses clung on for survival, surrounding cafes and restaurants disappeared one by one. To keep afloat, Wang wound down Coffee Anthology’s kitchen and reduced the front-of-house staff to just two – him and his wife. “We had a 70% reduction in profits,” Wang says. “There was nobody working, nobody visiting the city.” Data obtained by Guardian Australia shows food licences in Brisbane’s CBD decreased by 15% over the past two years, with the pandemic wreaking havoc on small businesses. Total food licenses declined from 616 in 2019 to 525 in 2021. Cafes and restaurants were among the hardest hit, with food licenses falling from 423 in 2019 to 372 in 2021. Takeaway food also felt an impact, with the 170 food licenses in 2019 decreasing to 134 in 2021. The lord mayor of Brisbane, Adrian Schrinner, says the pandemic has been particularly tough on the city’s cafes, bars and restaurants. But Schrinner says people are gradually returning to the CBD, with foot traffic in Queen Street mall now at about 67% of pre-Covid levels. “Momentum is growing in getting people back in offices and getting more people to support local retail and hospitality businesses,” Schrinner said in a statement. “I want to encourage everyone to visit the CBD and other shopping precincts and support our local businesses.” However, Brisbane businesses were dealt a second blow in February in the form of widespread flooding, which caused damage and power outages at many venues. Restaurants along Eagle Street Pier suffered from the surging of the Brisbane River, with Greek eatery Opa and Italian restaurant Massimo among the worst affected. Wes Lambert, chief executive of the industry association Restaurant & Catering Australia, says many cafes and restaurants are reporting a drop off in business after an initial rise at the beginning of the year. “Many members are reporting a bit of a slowdown, possibly due to the election or due to the lack of international tourists,” Lambert says. “It’s certainly a bit uncertain for 2023 with inflation and the cost of doing business skyrocketing, and with multiple international markets not fully back online. “There have also been issues due to the rains and floods from Brisbane to far north Queensland.” Lambert says the hospitality industry has been crippled by skill shortages, making reopening incredibly difficult for many businesses. To assist with recovery, Schrinner says the council has offered businesses a 50% discount on footpath dining applications and turned off the city’s parking metres in February and March. He says the council has also waived $5m in fees, rents and charges for Brisbane businesses and community groups impacted during the Omicron wave.",News/Australia news,Signs of life in Brisbane’s CBD after flood-affected false start,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/18/signs-of-life-in-brisbanes-cbd-after-flood-affected-false-start
5/18/2022,"MSPs have been urged to keep foremost in their minds that trans people are “human beings wanting to go about their daily lives”, as a Holyrood committee begins taking evidence on a draft bill that aims to streamline the process by which an individual can change their legal sex. Colin Macfarlane, the director of Stonewall Scotland, told members of the Scottish parliament’s equalities, human rights and civil justice committee: “There has been a whipping up of a moral panic and an othering of trans people in the public discourse. Trans people are not an ideology – trans people are our friends, our family and our colleagues.” Gender recognition reform is supported by every party in Holyrood bar the Scottish Conservatives but has been fiercely contested by some groups who argue it will fundamentally alter who can access women-only services, and complain they have not been adequately consulted. At the first public evidence session, Melanie Field, the chief strategy and policy officer for the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), called for more detailed consideration before legislative change was made, to ensure any reform was as “accepted and uncontroversial” as equal marriage. Field reflected that with the introduction of equal marriage, “concerns were able to be expressed and addressed and the legislation was constructed in such a way that appropriate safeguards were built into it. The result was the equal marriage is now accepted and uncontroversial and that is what I would like to happen here.” Asked how she would square the commission’s call for more information about the impact of change despite two public consultations since 2017, Field said she could “understand the frustration of trans people who have had promises held out” but: “As a regulator of the law, our guiding principle is that the impact of legislative change should be understood.” At the bill’s first evidence session, LGBT+ campaigners also expressed reservations about the current draft. Vic Valentine, the manager of Scottish Trans Alliance, said “the lack of recognition for non-binary people is the part of the bill that trans men and trans women are most disappointed about”, and prevented it being an “ambitious” change to the law. Valentine added that the requirement for applicants to have lived in their preferred gender for a specific time period was considered “arbitrary” by the trans community, who also thought the proposed three-month “reflection period” to be unnecessary, given the amount of consideration and social transition done by individuals before they applied for a certificate. Macfarlane said Stonewall Scotland was “extremely concerned” the current drafting of the bill could allow vexatious application for revocation of a certificate, for example by family members who were opposed to a person’s decision or even by a lobby group opposed to the change itself. Macfarlane told the committee the reforms would have no impact on the Equality Act – which affords protection from discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion, gender reassignment and other characteristics. However, later in the session EHRC representatives said further examination was required of the implications of recent court cases on evolving legal concepts of sex, for example. But Macfarlane said he wanted to highlight “this presentation of trans people and trans women in particular as a threat”, stating it was “deeply unfortunate … that there has been misinformation, some of it deliberate, around what the provisions of this bill will mean for the impact of women and girls”.",News/World news,"Trans people ‘not an ideology’, MSPs weighing gender recognition reform told",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/17/msps-gender-recognition-reforms-trans-stonewall-scotland-draft-bill-rights
5/18/2022,"It is Vladimir Putin’s war – or least that’s how the west characterises it. Not only was the decision to invade Ukraine made by the Russian president, but western military officials now say Putin is engaged in battlefield decision making “at the level of a colonel or brigadier” as the Donbas offensive in eastern Ukraine unfolds. In part, the observation is not very surprising. Any idea that the Russian president – as commander in chief – would not be involved in the battle plans, particularly once the war in Ukraine started going badly, would be impossible to believe. Autocratic regimes tend not to favour military decentralisation. But it also comes at a point of embarrassing military failure. An attempt to encircle Ukrainian forces last week resulted in nearly 500 killed and the loss of over 70 armoured vehicles in a disastrous attempt to cross the Siverski Donets river, which took place, western sources said, not under the cover of darkness but in broad daylight . So if the western claim is to be believed, Putin would have approved the battle plan. Decision making at the “level of a colonel or brigadier” implies a brigade level command of two or more battalions, the movement of 1,500 or more troops: precisely the kind of force that tried and failed to ford the strategic river. Prof Sir Lawrence Freedman from King’s College London, said he judged the military statement about Putin’s level of involvement to be plausible: “Putin has chased the military operation, first by giving very little notice he would launch an attack and then pushing hard for quick wins. That’s particularly been the problem with the second stage of the war, in the Donbas.” Yet claims about Putin goes further still. It brings to mind the idea of a political leader impatient of, or no longer trusting their generals – most notably the downfall of Adolf Hitler, who in the latter stages of the second world war, as described by biographer Ian Kershaw, refused to heed his generals’ calls for tactical retreats in the east and insisted instead upon overoptimistic counteroffensives, as in the Ardennes in the winter of 1944/5. But there are no shortage of other examples. In the early stages of the Vietnam war, US president Lyndon Johnson and his administration began a bombing campaign aimed at communist North Vietnam in 1965 called Rolling Thunder, which defined the targets that could be attacked to avoid offending China or Soviet Russia. The confused strategy was an attempt to break the resolve of Hanoi by bombing lesser targets from the air, and a step in an escalating war that the US would ultimately lose. In the run up to the final Iraq war, the country’s dictator Saddam Hussein decided that the country’s air force should play no part in the war, with its planes “in palm groves or buried them in the sand” according to an account in Foreign Affairs written three years after the war. The belief was the Iraqi air force would be no match for the western invaders – and that it was best saved for a post war future under his leadership that never transpired after the capture of Baghdad. But despite all the stories of meddling, the relationship between political leadership and military command has always been complex and at times fraught. Freedman, also the author of a soon to be published book on the subject called Command, says military decisions during war time are “intensely political” and that it is up to political leaderships to “set objectives, push senior commanders, ask questions”. The goal, Freedman argues, is to ensure there is “a dialogue between politicians and the military” and to that leaders are not overruling legitimate objections or trying to micromanage the battle-plans at a time when they should be concentrating on wider diplomatic or political strategies. For Putin, as the war in Ukraine approaches its twelfth week, the question arises whether the Russian leader has the time to focus on all that is before him if he is embroiled in tactical decision making in a Donbas offensive that is stalling – and the impact that further military failures would have on his standing. In the past few days some Russian military bloggers and experts have begun to question the strategy. One popular Russian blogger who uses the pseudonym Vladlen Tatarzky on his Telegram channel wrote: “Until we know the name of the ‘military genius’ who put a battalion tactical group by the river and he doesn’t answer for it publicly, then there will never be reforms in the army.” It turns out the writer might have been criticising Putin himself.",News/World news,Is Putin involved in strategic battlefield decisions in Ukraine invasion?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/17/is-putin-involved-in-strategic-battlefield-decisions-in-ukraine-invasion
5/18/2022,"The frontman and the guitarist for the American rock band Eagles of Death Metal have told a Paris court how they watched from the stage in confusion and horror as terrorists opened fire on the crowd at their sold-out concert at the Bataclan in 2015. Jesse Hughes, the band’s singer, and Eden Galindo, a guitarist, both said the attack, which left 90 people dead, had changed their lives for ever. They had travelled to Paris to give evidence in France’s biggest-ever criminal trial, over the attacks claimed by Islamic State on 13 November 2015. A total of 130 were killed and more than 400 were injured in synchronised suicide bombings and mass shootings across the French capital, from the national stadium to bars and restaurants and the Bataclan rock gig. Hughes, 49, said the gig should have been the best of their tour and he had been “really excited” to play in Paris. He said he recognised the sound of gunfire instantly when three gunmen with suicide vests burst in mid-show and opened fire. “Being from a desert community in California, I know the sound of gunshots,” he said. While other band members hesitated and wondered what was going on, Hughes said he “knew death was upon us”. He said the band “ran for their lives” while “nearly 90 of my friends [the fans] were murdered in front of us”. The band escaped through a side door after Hughes had found his girlfriend in the concert hall. Arthur Dénouveaux, a rock fan who is now the president of the survivors’ group Life for Paris, was among fans who managed to escape at the same time. He led the band members running through Paris streets, handing them €50 and putting them in a taxi to the nearest police station, where they found other fans covered in blood. During the wait there, they learned that Nick Alexander, who had been working on the band’s merchandise at the gig, had been killed. Hughes said that six years on he still got nervous looking into crowds, and he had been anxious about giving evidence, with emotions rising up that he thought he had got over. But he said: “Evil did not win … You can’t kill rock’n’roll.” Galindo, 52, said it had been a great show, with everyone dancing, and he had not understood the sound of gunshots at first, thinking it was the sound system. He said there were so many people in front of the stage that they could not move and he recalled the fans’ faces looking up at the band and the stage in confusion as the terrorists opened fire. “We were thinking that it was going to stop but it just kept coming,” Galindo told the court. “After a while they reloaded and a technician told us: ‘Next time they stop, we run.’” He said that when he had got home to the US he felt “broken” and found it hard to talk about “normal things”. He eventually left the band. “I’ll never be the same after that night,” he said, adding that he thought of the victims’ families every day. Hughes, arriving at the courthouse earlier on Tuesday, had been asked by the media how he felt to be in court facing Salah Abdeslam, believed to be the last survivor from the cell of 10 men who struck across Paris that night, as well as several others accused of preparing or helping the attacks. Hughes said: “I’m a Christian and everyone can be lost and everyone needs to find the way and most of the gentlemen in there do, so I forgive them and I hope that they find the peace of God themselves.”",News/World news,Eagles of Death Metal tell Paris terror trial how band ‘ran for their lives’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/17/eagles-of-death-metal-tell-paris-terror-trial-how-band-ran-for-their-lives
