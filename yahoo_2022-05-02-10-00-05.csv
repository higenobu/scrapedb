5/2/2022,"Normally I wouldn’t bother writing an article about something like the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, because unless you live here, why would you care? But the large, indoor event at the Washington Hilton was back for the first time since 2019 on Saturday night, even though members of the administration, including Vice President Kamala Harris, tested positive for COVID in recent days. And it was on in the wake of dozens of people reportedly testing positive after the Gridiron Dinner, another Washington-establishment event, earlier this month. Doctor-in-Chief Anthony Fauci even decided he wasn't willing to take the risk of attending. But apparently, the WHCD could not — NOT! — be canceled for a third year in a row. And so there I was, the day's White House pool reporter in a packed room of hundreds of unmasked journalists, celebrities, politicians, and President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden. Nearly everyone was boozing it up and taking photos of Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson, acting like it was a totally normal night. For a city that prides itself on having the most rational and analytical minds in the country, this weekend it suffered a collective case of cognitive dissonance, and you really have to question the wisdom of proceeding with the event. The program’s moment of lucidity came not from Washington’s own Very Serious People, but from the man who was there to make fun of them—Trevor Noah. “It is my great honor to be speaking tonight at the nation’s most distinguished superspreader event,” joked Noah, who headlined the dinner. “Do you read any of your own newspapers?” The crowd of thousands, seated at table after table packed into a crowded basement ballroom, just chuckled along. Funny! [laughs sobs] “You guys spent the last two years telling everyone the importance of wearing masks and avoiding large, indoor gatherings, then the second someone offers you a free dinner, you all turn into Joe Rogan,” Noah said. “Fauci thought it was too dangerous to come tonight. Pete Davidson thinks it’s OK, and we all went with Pete.” Sure, everyone was tested and vaccinated for the event. And listen, I'm not out to be a killjoy — the evening had its share of touching moments! They introduced a new award honoring Alice Dunnigan and Ethel Payne, the first Black women in the White House press corp. Young, aspiring journalists were awarded scholarships. And at a time when the press gets constantly attacked, it’s nice to see the Fourth Estate actually appreciated in an evening with a president that can take a joke. But “official Washington” as it likes to call itself, should have to reckon with the example it set this weekend, at the main event and all the little side parties leading up to it. If the approach to COVID now is to take calculated risks, the questions this weekend raises are: Could spending a weekend night at a work event really be worth the possibility of getting it? What is the result of the image of the people who are supposed to be the most trusted names in news at an event that flies in the face of common sense going to be? During his remarks at the dinner, Biden, who didn’t wear a mask at all for the nearly 90 minutes he sat at the head table, said that the press is a reflection of the country. “Good journalism holds up a mirror to ourselves, to reflect on the good, the bad, and the true,” Biden said. If that’s the case, based on this weekend’s showing, it’s not shocking that so much of the country thinks it's cool to have gone back to living their lives entirely normally. Here’s hoping, truly and genuinely, that the WHCD 2022 wasn’t a superspreader.

5/2/2022,"The pre-game show to Trump’s Nebraska rally was as wild as the main event. The crowd danced to YMCA.

Herbster: We’re going to take sex education out of the schools and put it back in the homes where it belongs! pic.twitter.com/ZQ4SAE6NeF — Acyn (@Acyn) May 1, 2022 Trump took to the stage as the Sept. 11 tribute song, “Proud to be an American,” played. He then told the crowd, “I could have gotten out of this one.” The rally, originally scheduled for Friday, had to be postponed because of potential severe weather in the area. Promoting Herbster, Trump said that the candidate accused of assault by multiple women was “a good man, a very good man.” (Trump has been credibly accused of sexual harassment or assault by at least 18 women.) But Trump only spared a few sentences for Herbster at the beginning, lest he focus on anyone other than himself for too long. The former president then launched into his usual spiel, bashing the Biden administration; complaining about gas prices; praising his own administration’s “accomplishments,” including the unfinished border wall and “the creation of Space Force.” “I think I was right about everything!” Trump exclaimed at one point. (According to The Washington Post, Trump made false or misleading claims a total 30,573 times over his four years in office.) He later returned to the subject of Herbster and mentioned the accusations against him as the reason he decided to travel to Nebraska for the rally. “Charles W., good man… He’s been badly maligned and that’s a shame. That’s why I came out here. Would have been easier to say, ‘I’m not gonna come.’ I come out, I defend people when I know they’re good… I have to defend my friends.” Trump then painted the accusations against Herbster as “he talked to somebody, he talked” (which is not true, eight women have accused the candidate of touching, grabbing, or kissing them without consent) before adding again that he could have gotten out of speaking at this event, “I could have gone to the beach!” Elsewhere in the speech, Trump ranted that Putin “never ever would have” invaded Ukraine “on my watch.” “So many people have been killed… That whole place is a disaster. That whole mess is a mess that should have never happened.” And he, as usual, bragged about supplying Ukraine with weapons that he was impeached for attempting to delay, whined that European nations don’t contribute enough to NATO, and complained about the “Mueller bullshit.” Of course, it isn’t a Trump rally without lies about the 2020 election. “The election was rigged and stolen,” Trump read from the prompter with no enthusiasm, more like he was reading a grocery list than a list of grievances. “And now our country is being destroyed because of it. Such stupid decisions are being made.” Trump went on to accuse Fox News of distancing themselves from him and trying to do “Trumpism without Trump.” “Who likes Trumpism without Trump? Does anybody like it?” he asked the crowd. “I don’t think so. I don’t know.” He later mused, “Maybe they’ll hire me as an anchor. We’ll riff. I just tell it like it is… We’ll get the highest ratings in history. We’re gonna make Donald Trump head of Deface the Nation or Meet the Fake Press.” Trump: ""We've endorsed Dr. Oz. We've endorsed J.P., right—J.D. Mandel. And he's doing great. They're all doing good. They're all doing good. And let's see what happens."" (He's endorsed J.D. Vance in Ohio) pic.twitter.com/41OM0AyXfc — Vaughn Hillyard (@VaughnHillyard) May 1, 2022 The latter part of the speech included a horrifically transphobic rant. “No teacher should ever be able to teach transgender to our children,” Trump said. “Save our kids, keep men out of women’s sports,” he added. Trump then said that if transgender players were allowed in basketball and he were a coach, he would “have five men on my team because I wanna win.” If I were a basketball coach, I would have five men on my team because I wanna win. I’d get LeBron,” he said, joking that he would ask the NBA player: “LeBron, did you ever have thoughts of going woman?” Trump also touted other candidates he has endorsed in the 2022 elections, kind of. “We’ve endorsed Dr. Oz. We’ve endorsed J.P., right? J.D. Mandel. And he’s doing great. They’re all doing good. They’re all doing good. And let’s see what happens.” Except, J.D. Vance is the candidate Trump endorsed, not J.D. Mandel. Vance is running against Josh Mandel in Ohio’s Republican Senate primary. This, from a “stable genius” with a perfect cognitive test score and a “very, very large brain” who claims he has been “right about everything.” Best of Rolling Stone The Useful Idiots New Guide to the Most Stoned Moments of the 2020 Presidential Campaign Anatomy of a Fake News Scandal The Radical Crusade of Mike Pence Click here to read the full article.
