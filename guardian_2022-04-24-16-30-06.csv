4/24/2022,"This weekend is the perfect time to get sowing hardy annuals to fill any gaps in borders. Not only are they great at self-seeding, giving you flowers year after year for the mere minutes it takes to sprinkle them over the soil, but with many of us feeling the pinch this month, there is also a thrifty trick to getting these for far lower cost than you might think. A surprisingly large range of popular garden plants are also sold as seeds in the herb and spice section of supermarkets at a fraction of the price of those in garden centres. For starters, the frothy, fragrant foliage of dill and fennel – much loved by Chelsea Flower Show designers in recent years – can easily be sown from the seeds in the spice section. Go to an Asian supermarket and you can get these in really sizeable packets for less than £1, which according to my calculations may be more than 95% cheaper than from the conventional gardening seed packet. The same goes for the closely related caraway and – even though I absolutely can’t stand the stuff – coriander, too. While you are there, if you pick up some Kalonji (aka nigella) seeds, you will get a close relative of love-in-a-mist, with smaller flowers on more dainty plants. I have found fenugreek, whose plants look like one of the pretty, ornamental clovers, are dead easy, too. They even have edible leaves that can be cooked and eaten like spinach – and are hard to track down in their fresh form in even the most well-stocked Asian food shop. The same thing goes for chamomile, the seeds of which can be found in regular teabags. Simply rip one open and scatter the contents over any open ground, ideally in full sun, and you will see germination in days and flowers within as little as a month, depending on the weather. I should stress, however, that this does have to be an unused bag, as the heat from brewing will otherwise render these unviable. Poppy seeds come, quite handily, usually in a shaker tin. The edible forms are often a paler, bluish pink with smaller flowers than the dazzling ornamental cultivars, but you’ll get easily 20 times the amount for the price. Finally, of course, there are sunflower seeds. As long as you pick the unshelled, unroasted form, these are super easy and virtually identical to the cultivars you see in the florists. Now, it is true that the germination rates in these bulk packets are likely to be far lower than the ones from the carefully controlled conditions of horticultural suppliers, and the cultivars aren’t always as showy as those specifically bred for aesthetic value. However, given the nominal cost – virtually free if you are grabbing these from that long-forgotten jar at the back of your spice rack or tea cupboard – they are absolutely worth the gamble.

4/24/2022,"On the stunning and craggy coastline of Holy Island in north Wales, work has started on a construction project to generate energy from one of the world’s greatest untapped energy resources: tidal power. The Morlais project, on the small island off the west of Anglesey has benefited from £31m in what is likely to be the last large grant for Wales from the European Union’s regional funding programme. It will install turbines at what will be one of the largest tidal stream energy sites in the world, covering 13 square miles of the seabed. Gerallt Llewelyn Jones, a director of Morlais Energy, which is operated by Anglesey-based social enterprise Menter Môn, said: “We have strong tidal resources around Wales and they have huge potential.” Compared with wind and solar power, tidal was a more predictable energy source, he added. The project won planning permission from the Welsh government last December and is designed to power more than 180,000 homes once fully operational. Its installation will be phased so that impact on the marine environment can be monitored. The last deep coal mine in Wales, Tower colliery near Aberdare, closed in 2008. Proponents of tidal energy say tide power could drive a new energy revolution in the country, creating thousands of jobs. A range of tidal projects, cost billions of pounds to develop, are now being proposed, and could put Wales at the forefront of a marine energy revolution. The Morlais project is powered by kinetic energy from tidal currents, but the larger-scale projects involve building lagoons with huge sea walls incorporating turbines powered by the rise and fall of tides. The west coast of Britain has one of the highest tidal ranges in the world. One of the most ambitious proposals is the North Wales Tidal Lagoon, with a sea wall of more than 19 miles, from Llandudno to Prestatyn. Its backers say the £7bn project could power more than a million homes and create over 20,000 jobs. Henry Dixon, chairman of North Wales Tidal Energy, which is promoting the proposal, said it would operate with about 120 turbines and it was seeking £50m in funding for the planning process, including impact assessments, engineering and design. He said: “Wales has this huge potential for marine and renewable energy. Wind and nuclear are needed, but we also need tidal. It is eminently cost effective and minister after minister says these schemes are very exciting, but they never get into government policy.” Britain’s most ambitious proposal for a tidal energy project – a £30bn Severn estuary barrage stretching from Somerset to south Wales – was scrapped in 2010. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds opposed the scheme, warning it would devastate the estuary’s bird habitats. Ministers concluded there was “no strategic case” for the project. In 2017, tidal schemes were given a boost with the publication of a review of tidal lagoons by the former energy minister Charles Hendry. He concluded that they could play a cost-effective role in the UK energy mix, helping to deliver security of supply and decarbonisation. “Tidal lagoons can be an important and exciting new industry,” he said. “We are blessed with some of the best resources in the world, which puts us in a unique position to be world leaders.” Hendry recommended a “pathfinder” scheme, but it was never delivered. Proposals for a £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay were rejected in 2018, and tidal power gets only a meagre mention in the government energy strategy published this month. Simon Hamlyn, chief executive of the British Hydropower Association (BHA), said the government had missed a “massive opportunity” by failing to include tidal lagoons, tidal barrages and hydropower as a major element in its new energy strategy. He said: “It’s an incomprehensible omission. I simply cannot understand why the government continues to dismiss hydropower and tidal range – both of which are world-beating technologies and which could power the UK into the future.” Hamlyn said the BHA was supporting a number of potential tidal range projects, including the North Wales Tidal Lagoon and a proposed £590m scheme at the Port of Mostyn in Flintshire, north Wales. There are also proposals for tidal schemes on the West Somerset coast, in Morecambe Bay and on Merseyside. The BHA said the schemes could deliver more than 10% of the UK’s energy needs. Roger Falconer, emeritus professor of water and environmental engineering at Cardiff University, said large tracts of agricultural land in Britain were being covered in solar panels despite the lack of sunshine in winter, but reliable tidal power was not being properly exploited. “The problem with tidal lagoons and barrages is that you don’t get the power until they are virtually completed, and that can take years,” he said. Large-scale schemes offered value for money compared with other energy sources, he added, but the government needed a better funding model for such projects. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “The government absolutely recognises the great potential of tidal power. This is why we have provided the marine energy sector with £175m of innovation and research and development funding, as well as ringfencing a £20m budget for tidal stream energy, for which bids are expected for Welsh projects. “The UK is a global leader in tidal power, to the extent that almost 50% of the world’s installed tidal stream capacity is in UK waters.”",News/Environment,Could Anglesey’s tidal energy project drive a new energy revolution?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/24/could-angleseys-tidal-energy-project-drive-a-new-energy-revolution
4/24/2022,"Satellite scrutiny of Ukraine is not just focused on military hardware. Thousands of miles away from the fighting, an international group of archaeologists, historians and technicians are quietly coordinating another high-stakes monitoring effort: the tracking of the mounting losses to Ukraine’s cultural landscape. Now an impact summary, released this month from their lab at a museum in the US state of Virginia, has revealed the bleak truth. So far, signs of damage to 191 cultural landmarks and venues have been detected. Most of the destruction – believed to have been carried out by invading Russian troops – has concentrated on Ukrainian memorials and places of worship. Fifty-eight churches, mosques, temples and cathedrals have now been listed, along with 111 memorial sites and nine public monuments. The war has also seen two arts venues attacked – including the theatre at Mariupol, images of which went around the world – and one archaeological site. Violence directed at monuments and buildings might seem insignificant compared to the growing toll of injury and death inflicted on Ukrainian families, but for a country in the shadow of a threatening neighbour, culture and heritage can play a crucial role. The deliberate targeting of religious and cultural sites is also prohibited by the 1954 Hague Convention, although individual perpetrators have rarely been punished. The Cultural Heritage Monitoring Lab, at the Virginia Museum of Natural History in Martinsville, is the hub for coordinating worldwide attempts to register and protect landmarks at risk. The network was set up last year in partnership with the acclaimed Smithsonian Institution Cultural Rescue Initiative, founded in response to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, which works to train museum curators around the world to react to conflict. News of any affected site goes back to Ukraine immediately in case the damage to artefacts can be limited, or at least documented on the ground. Inside Ukraine’s museums, many cabinets containing Byzantine icons and Scythian gold have been moved. Valuable artwork has been hidden in basements or moved secretly to supportive foreign museums. Other national collections are guarded by wardens who are now armed and ready to repel looters. The operation in Virginia draws on the expertise of curators from America and Europe and is led by archaeologist Hayden Bassett. “It’s a 24/7 operation,” he recently told the Washington Post. “Even though we might not be staring at a screen at 3am, our satellites are imaging at 3am.” Brian Daniels, an anthropologist working with the team in Virginia, said the rate of attacks had increased dramatically since the report’s publication. He told the Observer: “The violence is now concentrating on civilian infrastructure and this means museums and cultural heritage are targeted in this scorched-earth policy.” Bassett has seen significant cultural damage to the more densely populated areas, including the complete destruction of a museum in Ivankiv two months ago. The 26,000 cultural sites checked by the lab this month via a combination of remote sensing, open-source research and satellite imagery, include Ukraine’s seven world heritage sites. The best known of these is Kyiv’s golden-domed Cathedral of St Sophia, which remains intact. Ukraine’s ministry of culture has also urged witnesses to send photographs to its cultural crimes website, culturecrimes.mkip.gov.ua, so that verified evidence can be sent to the International Criminal Court. The lab’s new impact report defined cultural heritage broadly, covering venues and historical sites and monuments, but not libraries and archives. A detected “potential impact” means a sign of possible damage based upon remote sensing methods. Other, smaller impacts may not be visible to geospatial technology. The Russian-controlled territories of Donbas and Crimea were an early concern, according to Damian Koropeckyj, a senior analyst , who has found evidence that destroyed monuments there are being replaced by new ones supporting a Russian version of the areas’ heritage. “We’re a remote project. But it’s certainly very real to me. Believing we can make a difference here is important,” Koropeckyj said.",News/World news,Crimes against history: mapping the destruction of Ukraine’s culture,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/crimes-against-history-mapping-the-destruction-of-ukraines-culture
4/24/2022,"It’s hard to recall Bradley Wiggins sitting on his throne at Hampton Court, riding into Paris with the yellow jersey, or ringing the bell to start the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony without now seeing through to the secret he was carrying inside him on all those occasions. It took Wiggins nearly three decades to share his experience of grooming at the age of 13. It took Pam Shriver four decades to share her story of an emotionally abusive relationship with a coach. What about the other stories that haven’t yet been heard? While there is shock and sympathy, we must go further to draw out what needs to change and why change still hasn’t happened. After the revelations from Wiggins and Shriver, there has never been a more important time for any of us involved in sport, whether as athletes, coaches, parents, leaders, volunteers or journalists, to realise our responsibility to change. To challenge our assumptions about what healthy grassroots and high-performance sport looks and feels like. And to take positive action to create a different experience of sport for current and future generations. There seem to be three key messages from the stories of the past week. First, that safe sport must be the first priority, but for many, it still isn’t; second, that certain aspects of high-performance environments that are often admired – from behaviours of obsessive dedication, placing winning above everything else and the power balance within coach-athlete relationships – contribute to a darker side of sport that brings heavy long-term costs; and third, that our focus on heroic narratives throughout sport is at best misleading and at times deeply damaging, distracting us from the real stories of the people behind the hero masks. Last week marked five years since Tanni Grey-Thompson’s Duty of Care in Sport report with multiple recommendations still to implement. Why the delay? A new report by the athlete-led Kyniska Advocacy group, Stamping Out Sexual Violence in Sport, calls for urgent action. What excuses can there be not to protect young people in sport? Leaders across sport have failed to prioritise safe sport over medals and trophies. Many more are complicit in this – the media hound sports only about their results; sponsors are primarily interested in funding those who are going to win in the short-term; at government level, the short-term boost to national pride from hosting sporting events or winning medals is prioritised over longer-term opportunities for human and social development through sport. In the Olympic world, funding flows to the sports that bring home bags of medals and culture audits added in recent years quickly became tick-box exercises. In grassroots clubs, parents often brought up in a culture where having a medal brought status, recognition and opportunity, easily buy in to wanting that for their children, not realising the costs or that there is so much more to gain through sport that would outlast trophies; and coaches who know their jobs depend on short-term results are disincentivised from investing in the long-term holistic development of their athletes. Wiggins’s story of grooming at the age of 13 paints a troubling picture of youth abuse in sport. He describes his subsequent behaviour as a “loner”, “insular”, “strange teenager” and links that directly to the ensuing “drive on the bike”. To realise his much-admired competitive drive stemmed from such an abhorrent experience challenges us to stop and think twice about the sorts of competitive behaviours that we might push youngsters to emulate. Across the Olympic and Paralympic performance world, there is a belief that when teams are winning medals, you can’t be criticised or asked to change. Then, when issues have emerged, there has been a token response, a new policy drawn up or training course delivered – but the deep culture of behaviours and beliefs stays the same. That British Gymnastics’ integrity unit was getting five stars for its work at the same time as stories of alleged abuse at multiple clubs tells us what the gap between superficial change and real change looks like. The stories this week follow on from Simone Biles’s shock decision to step back from competing at the Tokyo Olympics in order to prioritise her mental and physical health. Coaches, leaders and athletes all have an opportunity to apply the rigour they have long applied to winning medals to creating a better, safer environment within which to pursue those medals. We need different goals, broader ambitions and success criteria beyond short-term, temporary, narrow outcomes. Human stories hold the answer: surely the goal has to be the story athletes tell beyond the result. The story they tell when they leave the sport, when they step off the podium or maybe don’t make the podium, and the story coaches tell of what they are valued for. Our objective should be to create environments where athletes leave sport with a positive story regardless of the result, ready to give back as role models and perhaps as a volunteer, coach or board member. That is what inspiring the next generation surely means. The American professor and writer Prof Brené Brown said: “When we deny the story it defines us. But when we own the story we can write a brave new ending.” At the same time as Wiggins and Shriver begin to write their brave new endings, there is a wider challenge for governing bodies and sports organisations, for coaches and athletes and all of us involved in sport to ensure that together we start developing a different, braver future for sport: creating better, safer success metrics and redefining what success in sport looks like.

4/24/2022,"Will five-year-olds and their parents ever get the chance to see the clitoris song performed at The Family Sex Show? All together: “Oh, go on then and touch it.” How long will they be denied the guidance, formerly on the TFSS’s website, on searching the internet for pictures of masturbating animals? “Sexual development and behaviour in children starts from birth”, as the company points out. Now the tots must make do with Squirrel Nutkin. But all may not be lost. Though the show has just been cancelled, following critical articles and online protests, its creators have responded with a commitment to future performances and a statement that instantly locates their struggle in the UK’s long tradition of artistic martyrdom at the hands of philistines. “We believe”, says ThisEgg company, “that what has happened is reflective of structural and societal attitudes towards relationships and sex education as well as art, culture and who is allowed to create and what we are allowed to engage with in the UK.” It might not have much artistic merit, the clitoris song, at least not written out, but isn’t that the kind of thing the Lord Chamberlain used to say about Joe Orton? This emphasis on artistic expression (albeit in a primarily educational enterprise) was respectfully received: you gathered that the rehabilitation of Mary Whitehouse has yet, in liberal circles, to extend to reviving her habit of condemning theatre unseen. And it can only have helped ThisEgg, given the current vogue for guilt by association, that her role in the dispute is played by Laurence Fox. It was the extreme behaviour of their would-be censors – “unprecedented threats and abuse directed at our building and team” – that had forced, the company said, the show’s cancellation. Nothing in its statement indicated that the project’s content, with its sexual songs, masturbation hints and adult nudity, had perhaps called for something more than the justifications on the show’s website, nor that, alongside online aggression, serious doubts about safeguarding had been carefully expressed. How, people asked, did the company’s line, “pleasure as a vehicle for consent”, make sense to 16-year-olds, let alone to children in reception year? Had it really been okayed (no, someone on Mumsnet checked) by the NSPCC? Writing in UnHerd, Mary Harrington did not doubt that The Family Sex Show was “well-intentioned”. But “by normalising the idea that pre-pubescent children should engage with sexual material, The Family Sex Show in practice carries water for genuine paedophiles”. Such responses could not have come as a surprise. Interviewed by Kate Wyver for the Guardian about her “show about sex and relationships for ages five and above”, Josie Dale-Jones anticipated resistance – and simultaneously dismissed it. “Children aren’t anxious about the idea of the show,” she said. “It’s the older people who feel discomfort in something that’s challenging their preconceptions.” And maybe – retirement homes would know – Captain Tom’s generation would indeed be disappointed to find The Family Sex Show’s “I have a penis in my pants” substituting for We’ll Meet Again. Younger older people may, however, have registered Oh! Calcutta! running for ever, while their formal sex education was confined, where it existed, to diagrams of rabbits. In many ways, there could hardly be a more promising audience. No matter: “older people”, particularly older women, are accustomed to seeing this descriptor used as a shorthand for pitiful irrelevance. Dale-Jones reminds the merely middle aged, the proudly not-boomers, that the wrong or unfashionable opinions can still be dreadfully ageing. An excessive concern for boundaries can, this suggests, put a good 10 years on you; doubts about online masturbation searches betray, at any age, an inner pearl-clutching (a popular code for annoying, older and female) hysteric. Originally a substitute for pensioner, the “older people” category is regularly expanded to include most people over 50, as experienced by the stars of the Sex and the City sequel, and even, if they are careless enough to cause trouble, by women still strangers to the perimenopause. Laurence Fox is, for what it’s worth, 43. There are, as Dale-Jones’s comment confirms, no strict rules. If relatively young people can recoil, as they have, from a performance introducing five-year-olds to masturbation, it just goes to prove the old adage that you’re only as old as your opinion on The Family Sex Show. It is naturally the fate of Mumsnet’s members, so many of them being female, intelligent, sexually unavailable and indifferent to male abuse, that their age should be considered ideologically telling in a way that, if it caught on generally, would mean reading repeatedly about “the mainly middle-aged shadow cabinet”, “the mainly middle-aged guests on The News Quiz”, “the mainly middle aged or older court of appeal”. Opening a discussion on The Family Sex Show one contributor began: “Just for clarity & in case anyone jumps at the chance to call me a rightwinger bent on denying women reproductive rights: I’m a socialist agnostic who has protested anti-abortionists.” The selective attribution of oldness and its variants to uncooperative adults of all ages only underlines, of course, its continuing value as an insult, one with the bonus of being, still, semi-respectable. We recently heard “dinosaur” deployed by the otherwise peerlessly inclusive David Lammy. Unlike David Cameron, who was accused by Labour of ageism after he aimed it at Dennis Skinner, Lammy, no gerontophobe, used it impartially it to insult all women who insist, on one subject, on disagreeing with him. “Auntie” worked well recently, for one of the Harry Potter stars wanting to condescend to JK Rowling without being as rude as Emma Watson. With or without the added “crone” or “witch”, old, as more and more people are discovering, is the perfect insult for our times: for caring individuals who know name calling is bad.

4/24/2022,"Saudi Arabia appears to be banking on Donald Trump’s return to office by refusing to help the US punish Russia for the Ukraine invasion, and by placing $2bn in a new, untested investment fund run by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. In seeking to persuade Riyadh to increase oil production so as to lower prices by as much as 30%, and thereby curb Russian government revenue, the Biden administration is looking for ways to reassure the Saudi government that it is dedicated to the kingdom’s security. The White House said on Thursday it was an “iron-clad commitment from the president on down”, and the Pentagon is reported to be working on a draft of a new statement of US-Saudi security arrangements, but observers say it is likely to fall short of the firm guarantees the Saudis and other Gulf states are demanding. The kingdom’s de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, reportedly declined to take a call from Joe Biden last month, showing his displeasure at the administration’s restrictions on arms sales; what he saw as its insufficient response to attacks on Saudi Arabia by Houthi forces in Yemen; its publication of a report into the Saudi regime’s 2018 murder of the dissident and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi; and Biden’s prior refusal to deal in person with the crown prince. Instead, Prince Mohammed shows signs of betting on the return to office of Trump in 2024, and the resumption of the Trump administration’s cosy relationship with Riyadh. There have been calls for an investigation into the huge investment made by the Saudi Public Investment Fund, controlled by Prince Mohammed, in Affinity Partners, a private equity firm set up by Jared Kushner months after he left the White House and his job as special adviser to Trump, his father-in-law. In doing so, the kingdom’s de facto ruler ignored the warnings of the Saudi fund’s own advisory panel. It worried about Affinity’s inexperience: Kushner was in real estate before his White House stint, and his track record of investments was widely considered not particularly good. It was concerned that the new company’s due diligence on operations was “unsatisfactory in all aspects”, and that it was charging “excessive” fees, according to a report in the New York Times. “It boils down to something very simple. The Saudis – meaning Mohammed bin Salman – have chosen Trump over Biden, and they’re sticking to their bet,” said Bruce Riedel, a former senior CIA official who is director of the Brookings Institution’s intelligence project. “It’s not an unreasonable proposition. Trump gave them everything they wanted: complete support in Yemen, support over the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, whatever they wanted in terms of access in the United States.” John Jenkins, a former UK ambassador to Saudi Arabia said: “I suspect [the crown prince] is betting on the Republicans winning big in the midterms and then regaining the presidency – with or without Trump.” He added: “He probably thinks Biden is politically weak and he can therefore afford to spite him. That sends a signal not just to the Dems but also to the Republican party. And – judging by the debate raging in DC policy circles on these matters – it’s working.” The Saudi embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. Senior Democrats reacted furiously to the revelation of the Saudi investment into Kushner’s fund. Senator Elizabeth Warren called for the justice department to “take a really hard look” at whether the arrangement was illegal. Senator Chris Murphy tweeted: “Just because the breathtaking corruption occurs in public doesn’t make it not breathtaking.” In the first months of the Trump administration, Kushner was instrumental in switching its support from the former crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, to the much younger Mohammed bin Salman, with whom the president’s son-in-law had established a rapport largely over the messaging service WhatsApp. After the Khashoggi murder, Kushner was also the crown prince’s staunchest advocate. As for the Biden administration, there are advocates inside it for placating the Saudi crown prince in pursuit of the overarching objective of bringing down oil prices – for its impact both on Kremlin coffers and on the politically sensitive price at the pump. “There is a real argument at the moment that you can befriend anyone who isn’t Russia now,” a European diplomat observed. The Pentagon has recently been holding meetings aimed at hammering out a statement on US security arrangements with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. However, Kirsten Fontenrose, former senior director for the Gulf at the national security council, said that whatever the administration comes up with is unlikely to come close to regional demands for security guarantees akin to Nato’s article 5 provisions for mutual defence. “There’s been this big push for an article 5 by a lot of these countries recently,” said Fontenrose, now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. “But there’s not a chance they are going to get it.” The Pentagon would not comment on its reported work reframing Gulf security arrangements. A spokesman, Army Maj Rob Lodewick, said: “The Department of Defense remains committed to helping advance the security of Saudi Arabia against serious external threats. “We are doing this through defense cooperation, arms transfers and defense trade, exercises, training and exchanges, alongside engagement on human rights and civilian harm mitigation.” Even if the administration wanted to offer such guarantees, there is no way such an agreement would gain approval from Congress, where the progressive wing of the Democratic party wants Biden to be tougher on Riyadh, especially in view of its lack of cooperation over oil production and Russia. “The US continues to provide certain types of equipment. They have announced several arms sales just within the last year. There is logistics support and maintenance,” said Seth Binder, director of advocacy at the Project on Middle East Democracy. “All these things to my mind should be on the table, particularly if this Saudi regime continues to increase this sort of public pressure on the Biden administration.” Many observers believe, however, that Mohammed is unlikely to be swayed either by wooing or by threats, as the high oil price boosts his budget while he waits for a more amenable administration. “I don’t see it changing very much. The Saudis have chosen to go with Putin and the oil production level they want, and the world economy is adjusting to that,” Reidel said. “I don’t think there’s much room for manoeuvre for Biden either … I think there are powerful forces against that.”",News/US news,Saudis’ Biden snub suggests crown prince still banking on Trump’s return,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/24/saudi-arabia-kushner-trump-biden-mohammed-bin-salman
4/24/2022,"What everyone’s doing, apparently,” my boyfriend said last night, in a conversation about heating bills, “is buying an electric heated hoodie from Aldi,” and that was when I knew it had arrived. The anti-sex backlash was here. It’s been murmuring for a while now, the threat of a zipped-up reaction to recent decades of sex positivity, and to mainstream relaxing of attitudes towards sex and sexuality. It culminated last month with a number of headlines asking, “Was Mary Whitehouse ahead of her time?” The thoughtful emoji comes into its own here, its yellow face and furrowed brow doing the work of a thousand think-pieces. With its contemplative finger it considers the claim: morality campaigner Whitehouse was forthright on the dangers of pornography. But Whitehouse was also a homophobic loon, outspoken against equal marriage and feminism, arguing that the BBC was at the centre “of a conspiracy to remove the myth of God from the minds of men” and homosexuality was caused by abnormal parental sex “during pregnancy or just after”, saying, “Sixty per cent of homosexuals who go for treatment get completely cured.” She would have applauded Boris Johnson’s exclusion of trans people from the conversion-therapy bill. The question seems to be then, not “Was Whitehouse ahead of her time?” but “Is time doing a screeching U-turn in order to catch up with its conservative queen?” In philosopher Amia Srinivasan’s brilliant essay collection, The Right to Sex, she discusses her surprise at her Oxford University students’ reaction to sex-negative feminism of the 1970s and 80s: having seen the effects of pornography on their own lives, they were deeply sympathetic. They weren’t the only ones. New Statesman columnist Louise Perry is publishing The Case Against the Sexual Revolution, which argues for “a new sexual culture built around dignity, virtue and restraint”. It is likely to find a hungry audience in the “puriteen” generation, so-called because it is turning its back on sex-positivity and, in some cases, sex itself. But from this distance it seems clear that, on the whole, sex is not the problem. The problem is that sex continues to be used, not for pleasure, or function or boredom, but as a political missile. Like Whitehouse, Conservatives today continue to see themselves as anti-establishment rebels, marching into battle with only their decency and common sense to protect them. Sometimes also, admittedly, a gun. As puritan politics spread, marginalised groups feel the first pinch. It’s no coincidence that in the first few months of 2022 alone, more legislation targeting LGBTQ+ people was introduced in America (seeking to criminalise transgender healthcare and ban transgender kids from participating in youth sports) than in any year so far. Anti-trans activists on social media claim trans people are “grooming” children, a shuddery word that comes up again and again today in rightwing discourse, especially in the US around new Florida legislation that critics call the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. It’s a particularly mad and cynical tactic, using the reality of child abuse to raise panic about predatory behaviour, the intention being to seed the idea that LGBTQ+ adults cannot be trusted and should live under the threat of criminalisation, surveillance and, inevitably, violence. Since Disney said they’d no longer support the bill (which prohibits teachers from discussing the existence of LGBTQ+ people) the company has become a focal point for far-right fury, with US extremist politicians, such as Marjorie Taylor Greene warning that Disney “wants to completely take your children and they want to indoctrinate them into sexual, immoral filth”. “Take me, Mickey!” shout the kids in the glittering fetishwear their parents bought them from the merch stand. “Take me completely!” No wonder there’s an anti-sex backlash, when today sex and the threat of sex is routinely framed as something intrinsically dangerous, whether discussing dating apps or Disneyworld. But despite the illusion we’re living in a sexually liberated culture and despite the internet revealing new depths and flavours of lust, I think the backlash is happening because we were never truly liberated. Not from the model of sex designed by men, nor from the threat of sexual violence or shame or even from the idea that sex is necessarily important, political or identity-defining. Despite Love Island and Sex and the City, it seems the sex-negative feminism of the 1970s and 80s never really went away, because so many of the issues that drove it were turfed over, rather than destroyed. The anti-sex feelings rising today build on historic wounds and the lessons sexual liberators attempted to teach – that sex was powerful and meaningful and greater than the sum of its parts – are manipulated and weaponised daily, by bad people in bad faith. I’ll watch this culture war play out from the vantage point of middle age, in my heated hoodie, sexless, but cosy at least.

4/24/2022,"In his latest film, The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, Nicolas Cage plays himself. This is not, it’s fair to say, much of a career departure. Arguably, Cage has been playing variations on the theme of Nic Cage for the best part of four decades. Part of the fun of a Nic Cage movie, particularly genre fare such as Face/Off or Mandy, is filling in the bingo card of Cage-ian performance tropes – the weird, lurching emphases on random words; the loping roll of a gait, like a hound puppy that hasn’t quite grown into the size of its paws. The volcanic bursts of SHOUTING. It’s this aspect of his distinctive screen presence that has lately been harnessed into “Cage rage” memes, which quote the most extreme elements of a Cage performance and then magnify them to grotesque comic effect. Cage himself has gone on record expressing his disappointment with the “Cage rage” depiction of his acting approach, arguing, fairly perhaps, that it’s reductive, a denial of the degree of craft he brings to each role. With that in mind, and with his performance in last year’s Pig a reminder that Cage is capable of an extraordinary churning, internalised complexity, his decision to star in this film seems somewhat unexpected. An action comedy that sees Cage recruited by US secret services to spy on a wealthy fan, while also finding himself collaborating with the suspect on a dialogue-driven, character-led screenplay, Unbearable Weight could be viewed as an admission of defeat to the memeification of Nic Cage. Or, perhaps, by confronting the Cage-ian cliches head on, by owning them, he can finally move past them. Part of the film’s clutter of messages is, after all, the fact that only through separating himself from the voracious beast that is a movie star career can Cage find peace in his private life, with amicably divorced wife, Olivia (Sharon Horgan), and his exasperated 16-year-old daughter, Addy (Lily Mo Sheen). Most likely, though, given that the version of Cage that we first meet in this new film is an inflated buffoon who claims to be a proponent of a “nouveau shamanic” approach to acting, the movie appealed because it’s both a joke at the expense of the egos and excesses of Hollywood while also serving as a love letter to the same. In playing a version of himself, Cage follows in the footsteps of John Malkovich, star of Spike Jonze’s Charlie Kaufman-scripted fantasy Being John Malkovich, and Jean-Claude Van Damme, who played himself as a down-on-his-luck action star (he’s even losing out on roles to Steven Seagal, the ultimate ignominy) in Mabrouk el Mechri’s JCVD. Of those two films, Unbearable Weight has more in common with JCVD, but this movie’s flighty tone of self-referential humour and affectionate industry jabs has a kinship with Barry Sonnenfeld’s Get Shorty, with which it shares a similar organised crime/movie industry overlap. Nic Cage (the fictional one) is a mess. With a career bleeding out through a B-movie plughole and a tendency to make everything – his daughter’s birthday, the song he composed for her – about himself, he is hostage to a hectoring inner voice (played by a digitally de-aged Wild at Heart-era Nic Cage) that reminds him that he’s Nic f*****g Cage and should act accordingly. He’s initially resistant to the offer of a gig appearing at the birthday party of billionaire super fan Javi (Pedro Pascal, charm personified), but grudgingly takes the job. Debts are mounting and this trip to a luxury compound in Mallorca comes with a handsome pay cheque. What he didn’t expect was to find a soulmate in Javi, who shares his love of the German expressionist silent horror film The Cabinet of Dr Caligari and introduces him to the joys of Paddington 2. But the burgeoning bromance is interrupted by CIA agent Vivan (Tiffany Haddish), who informs him that Javi is the head of a cartel and is implicated in the kidnapping of a teenage girl. Director and co-writer Tom Gormican, whose previous film was the poorly received bro-comedy That Awkward Moment, favours a combination of broad physical humour – Cage, reeling from an accidentally self-administered stunning agent and scaling the outside of Javi’s villa, is giddy fun – and cine-literate referential jokes, some of which land more successfully than others. The screenplay is so meta that at times it is practically consuming itself, an ouroboros of in-jokes. But there’s an affable appeal to the picture that disarms the more self-satisfied tendencies of the writing, and which stems from the chemistry between Cage and Pascal. Come for the industry satire, stay for the endearingly goofy buddy movie.",Arts/Film,The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent review – enjoyably meta Nicolas Cage buddy movie,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/24/the-unbearable-weight-of-massive-talent-review-enjoyably-meta-nicolas-cage-buddy-movie
4/24/2022,"Don’t, whatever you do, call it a village. Watlington, population 2,643, on the edge of the Chiltern Hills in Oxfordshire, is reputed to be the smallest town in England. “We are so proud of that fact,” says 17-year-old Kitty Tait. “The townspeople, the smallest townspeople, are very proud of that.” “And we are some of the smallest people in the smallest town,” interjects Al Tait, Kitty’s 52-year-old dad, who describes himself as looking like a Guess Who? character: bald, glasses, ginger-flecked beard. “We are,” agrees Kitty, who has inherited her father’s vivid red hair and blue eyes. “We’re called the Tiny Taits.” Watlington may be diminutive but it is perfectly formed. On a Friday morning in March, shoppers with canvas bags nip between – on one street – an excellent butcher, Angela’s veg stall, a fancy chocolate shop and the Orange Bakery, which the Taits opened in early 2019. “We’re working on the candlestick makers,” says Kitty, smiling. “It reminds me of the town in Hot Fuzz. I tell myself, ‘There’s a dark underbelly here…’” The Orange Bakery, especially, has developed a cult following. An artist called Biddy who makes work about “anything that’s dead”, describes it to me as the heartbeat of Watlington. When I’m hanging around the shop, a man with his toddler son tells me, unsolicited, that the Taits make the best bread in the world. When I tell Kitty that later, she replies: “Well, I did pay him. Money well spent. The boy, actually, was the expensive one.” They come, and usually queue, for the sourdough, baguettes and focaccia, but Kitty and Al throw out all sorts of unusual and wonderful bakes. Kitty’s favourite loaf is The Comfort, which is laced with Marmite and has a salty, umami crust with a Twiglet-like flavour. One of their proudest creations is Happy Bread, made from doughnut dough, caramel and sea-salt flakes, with an optional sprinkling of chocolate-infused CBD oil, the (legal) chemical extracted from marijuana. If you can’t make it to Watlington, there is a new Orange Bakery cookbook called Breadsong, named after the hiss and crackle that loaves make when they come out of the oven, a sound that some bakers think sounds like faraway applause. The Taits are exceptional bakers but the story behind the Orange Bakery might be even more remarkable. “I wouldn’t wish what’s happened to us to happen to anybody,” says Al when he picks me up in the work van, a Nissan S-Cargo called Dodo. “But I’m so glad it has.” It began in spring 2018, when Al and his wife, Katie, started to notice that something was up with Kitty, then 14 and the youngest of their three children. Kitty was doing well at school and was known for her infectious giggle, but, almost imperceptibly, she became less sociable, more anxious. She ate less and less, was hardly sleeping and began to have panic attacks. Soon, she couldn’t get out of bed, and stopped going to school. Kitty had depression and started to see a therapist in Oxford twice a week. The sessions, though, never made much headway. At home, Al and Katie tried everything they could think of with Kitty: gardening, sewing, painting. Nothing stuck. Al, who worked with dyslexic undergraduates at Oxford University and the charity Now Teach, which encourages older people to go into teaching, pretty much wound down his career. One afternoon, out of ideas, he made a loaf using New York baker Jim Lahey’s no-knead method. It wasn’t particularly special, but Kitty took an interest. “It was like alchemy,” she recalls. Both agree that the routine was as appealing as the bread. Kitty and Al made more and more loaves; Kitty took to sleeping in the kitchen, because she felt more comfortable being around her dough. “Everyone should have a bed in their kitchen,” she writes in Breadsong. Pretty quickly, the Taits had more bread than they could ever get through as a household, so they started offering it to neighbours. Strangers would collar Kitty in the Co-op supermarket and ask how they could get hold of one of the loaves: “It was like being the drug lord of Watlington.” Kitty is so funny, so energetic, it is hard when you meet her now to imagine anything different. Writing Breadsong with Al, which is a memoir as much as a recipe collection, forced her to confront how ill she had been. “None of this is planned,” says Kitty, over a lunch of sausage rolls and knäckebröd in their home. “When we started baking, we didn’t think: ‘Right, we want to set up a bakery, let’s learn how to bake.’ At first, it was just pure survival mode. And literally every day just thinking ahead to the next day was too exhausting. We were so living in the moment. “And writing about it, I didn’t realise how emotionally exhausting it was going to be,” she goes on. “There’s all this trauma that I’d just pushed down and moved on from that I had to work my way through again. And that was really painful, but also really good because, at the end of it, I understood, not why I got ill or why I struggled, but I became immensely proud of myself. Beforehand, I’d felt really ashamed of my mental health: the times that I couldn’t get out of bed or the times when I just had to scream. And writing about it made me realise my mental health wasn’t my fault and it never really was. And there might be other people who might feel ashamed of their mental health.” When we meet, Al and Kitty are in the process of recording the audiobook for Breadsong. “It is an emotional process reading it back,” says Al. “There’s the catharsis of it, but there are still moments where, just because I’m a soppy old fool, I’ll find it quite hard to read some bits. Because it takes me back.” Kitty is the first to admit she has an obsessive streak. Not long ago, she “had a fling” with carrots: she was eating a bag a day, pretty much. Eventually her skin started turning orange, a harmless condition called carotenemia. “I thought you’d been using fake tan, which is very unlike you!” says her mum, Katie. “It really reminded me of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, with the child who turned into a blueberry.” Baking has allowed Kitty to channel her energies more productively. In the early days, when she was not well enough to travel, much of this was done by “stalking” bakers and chefs she admired on Instagram: a global knowledge base that includes Chad Robertson from Tartine in San Francisco, Christina Tosi from Momofuku Milk Bar in New York and the best sourdough bakeries around the UK. Many of Kitty’s heroes have been generous with advice – Robertson and his partner Elizabeth Prueitt backed the Kickstarter for the Orange Bakery to move into new premises – and some have become friends IRL. Since Kitty has recovered, she has gone out on short placements at the Dusty Knuckle and Little Bread Pedlar in London and Hamblin Bread in Oxford. “For lots of girls, particularly my age, but I think older people too, Instagram can be a place where you compare yourself in a way that’s really negative and slightly addictive,” says Kitty. “But I wouldn’t be here without Instagram. At the beginning, it enabled me to see that there was this outside world that wasn’t just Watlington. And it drove me to bake better.” As the bakery moved on from a subscription model to a pop-up to a permanent space on Watlington’s High Street, Al Tait started to realise that he wasn’t going back to his old life. There have been financial concerns along the way but, as the bakery has grown in productivity and popularity, these have lessened, too. One day, when friends asked him to witness their wills, he wrote his occupation as “baker” and he realised that his heart soared as he did so. “I feel I’m the lucky one out of the two of us, because I’ve been able to have this second chapter,” he says. “Kitty’s creativity, and her independence, is extraordinary. I don’t think I’ve brought that out, I’ve just happened to be there at the same time.” Kitty and Al make a good team, and four years of 5am starts have done nothing to dent that. They have carved out their spaces in the operation – “I’m anything cheese-related,” says Al. “The cheese king is here!” – and have a closeness that not many fathers share with their teenage daughters. “When I got depressed and when I was dealing so badly with anxiety, you were the one who really, really understood,” Kitty tells Al. “And that’s because you’d also gone through depression, but you really listened. And I think because my brain was so fragmented, when it rebuilt, you were just kind of part of it. Most teenagers don’t have that as much, because they move away, but you’re not just my parent any more, you’re part of me. You’re my best friend, and you’re also my business partner. And you’re also just, like, my partner.” Kitty laughs to break the emotion. “Partner in crime!” she says in a sarcastic voice, before turning serious again. “And I love that.” Both Al and Kitty are effusive about Aggie and Albert, Kitty’s patient siblings, who had to put up with their kitchen being turned into a professional bakery for a couple of years. Kitty has even named one of the Orange Bakery’s sourdough loaves after her brother. “We think he likes the fact that it’s called The Albert,” says Katie, their mum. Then she giggles: “He doesn’t really, actually.” This would be an obvious time for the Orange Bakery to expand, employ more staff, open new sites. The Taits started making plans but one day not long ago, as they were mixing dough for the following morning, Kitty turned to her dad and said she wasn’t ready to take a more hands-off role, mainly because she loved what they were doing now. He’d been thinking the same thing. They both want to work more with schools, with a local prison; Kitty often says she wants to “democratise” good bread. They both want to write more. Perhaps, they think, the best way to achieve this would be to open the shop less rather than take on extra commitments. Kitty, perhaps remembering her age, is also aware that there might be other things in her life that have nothing to do with dough. “But I also think that bread, just like Dad, will always just be a part of me,” she says. “Fundamentally, when all my fragments broke, when I was just all over the place, Dad was there and bread was there. And that’s just who I am.” This was the first bread recipe I learned, and how the simple ingredients transform into a loaf still feels like magic. All you need to make a loaf twice as tasty as anything on the supermarket shelf, with a crunchy crust and pillowy crumb, is a casserole dish with a lid and an oven that can get up to 210C fan/gas mark 8. At the beginning our oven could only reach 160C fan, so even if yours is lacking oomph, your breadmaking is not doomed. If you make only a single recipe from this book, this one will probably give you the biggest thrill. It’s truly a miracle. strong white bread flour 500g, plus extra for dustingfine sea salt 10ginstant dried yeast 3g (1 tsp or slightly less than half a 7g sachet)lukewarm water 330ml Sift the flour into a large mixing bowl and add the salt and yeast. Stir together using either a sturdy spoon or, my personal favourite, your hands. Bit by bit gently mix in the lukewarm water until a shaggy dough forms. We call this the Scooby dough in homage to Scooby-Doo. Place a damp tea towel or shower cap over the rim of the bowl and leave in a cosy draught-free place to prove for hours – overnight is best. Like the fairy godmother turns a pumpkin into a carriage, time transforms your scrappy, dull dough into a bubbly, live creature of its own, although I think I’d prefer the pumpkin over the carriage. Once your dough has risen and is bubbling away, tip it on to a lightly floured work surface. Remember it’s alive so the greater respect you show the dough with gentle handling, the more it will reward you and the better your loaf will come out. Gently shape the dough into a ball – a well-floured plastic dough scraper really helps here – making sure there is a light coating of flour all over. Place the shaped dough on a sheet of parchment paper, cover with a damp tea towel and set aside in a warm, cosy place to rest for 1 hour. Halfway through the resting time, preheat the oven to 210C fan/gas mark 9 or as high as it will go. Put a large cast-iron casserole dish with a lid and a heatproof handle into the hot oven for 30 minutes to heat up. Once the casserole dish is good and hot, carefully take it out of the oven and lift off the lid. Uncover the dough and, using the parchment paper, lift and then lower the dough into the heated casserole dish. Using a sharp knife, razor blade or scissors, score the top of the dough with slashes in any pattern you like – one long slash, a cross, a square or even a smiley face. You might want to invest in a baker’s lame for this, basically a razor blade in a stick and cheap as chips but, alongside your dough scraper, a good friend. Pour a couple of tablespoons of water inside the casserole around the dough, replace the lid and put the dish back in the hot oven. Bake for 30 minutes with the lid on. Remove the lid to reveal your magnificent loaf, then continue to bake uncovered for a further 10 minutes to get a nice, golden crust or 15 minutes if you like your loaf a bit darker. I do. Place the loaf on a wire rack and leave to cool for at least 30 minutes. This is the hardest part, but it’s also the most important as the bread keeps cooking after you take it out of the oven. If you listen carefully, you might even hear the loaf sing – this is the “breadsong”. Just don’t scorch your ear … You’ve just made bread. No mess, though I always find a way. No kneading. Just magic. Variations: Pain de campagne Swap 250g of the strong white bread flour for wholemeal flour. This results in an earthy loaf that makes you feel like you’ve been working in a field all day.Serving suggestion With a slab of salted butter and some chunky country paté. Seeded rye Swap 100g of the strong white bread flour for rye flour and add 100g toasted seeds of your choice. My favourite combo is pumpkin, sunflower and linseed. This makes a dense loaf with a nice, roasted nuttiness. But be warned, working with rye is like handling wet concrete. When your hands get all sticky from the dough, use a bit more flour to wipe them clean. Sounds weird, but it’s so much better than scraping off dough under a running tap.Serving suggestion Cut thinly, toasted and spread with a scraping of horseradish sauce, some smoked salmon and a couple of thinly sliced cornichons. The Comfort Add 1 or 2 tablespoons of Marmite or other yeast extract, dissolving it in the 330ml warm water before mixing it into the dry ingredients. This is my favourite loaf. I started making this bread at a time when every day seemed like a war zone, full of panic attacks, extreme lows and constant blasts of exhausting mental shrapnel. Every night I looked forward to mixing the dough that I’d bake in the morning. Everything about this loaf makes me feel safe. Its sweet, slightly charred smell, its crust (like Twiglets), its squishy, soft, more-ish centre. Whenever I knew the day ahead would be hard, I’d make this loaf.Serving suggestion If I had my way, I’d be very happy eating the Comfort loaf with cheese all day, every day. I used to hate chelsea buns; I just couldn’t see the point of anything where raisins or sultanas were involved. Every now and again I would chomp into a cookie, bun or pastry speckled with chocolate chips, only to find out that they weren’t chocolate chips at all and were in fact chewy, dry little pellets – raisins or sultanas, my nemesis. However, after a lot of requests, mainly from customers of a certain vintage, I decided to have a go. Like in Roald Dahl’s Danny Champion of the World, I soaked the dried fruit. This made them plump and juicy. This, together with adding thinly sliced apple, results in an amazingly soft bun that is now one of the bakery favourites (even with our customers under the age of 70). Makes 12 bunseverything dough 1 quantity (see below) For the fillingraisins, sultanas or mixed dried fruit 150ggaram masala 1 tspdried cranberries 50g (optional, but great if you can get hold of them)tea bag 1 (English breakfast or earl grey)boiling water about 100mlunsalted butter 50g, meltedsoft light brown sugar 50gground cinnamon 1 tbspapple 1, thinly sliced (optional, but strongly recommended)lemon zest of 1 (optional) For the glazewater 50mlorange marmalade or apricot jam 1 tbsp For the icingicing sugar 100gwater 1 tbsp In a mixing bowl, stir together the raisins, sultanas or mixed dried fruit and garam masala (and the cranberries if you want). Add the tea bag (English breakfast is fine, but earl grey adds a really nice fragrance) and pour in enough boiling water to cover. Set aside to steep for at least 15 minutes or overnight. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough into a 30cm ×20cm rectangle roughly 1cm thick. This is much easier when the dough has proved overnight in the fridge and is still cold. Lay the dough rectangle on the work surface with a longer side facing you. Brush the surface of the dough with the melted butter, sprinkle with the sugar and cinnamon, then lay the apple slices on top. Drain the fruit in a colander and remove the tea bag. Scatter the plump fruit over the dough along with the lemon zest, if using. Starting at one long edge, roll the dough into a tight log. Using a sharp knife or length of thread, slice the dough crossways into 12 equal slices, each roughly 2cm wide. Line a deep baking tray with parchment paper. Place the dough slices cut-side down on the tray, spacing them 1cm apart. Place a damp tea towel over the top and leave in a warm place to prove for 40-45 minutes, or until doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6. Bake in the hot oven for 18-20 minutes or until golden brown. Check the buns halfway through the cooking time. If they are cooking unevenly, then turn the tray around. If they are browning too quickly, drape a sheet of foil over the buns – any exposed raisins may burn and you don’t want the bitterness that brings. Leave the buns to cool in the tray for 5 minutes and then transfer to a wire rack. To make the glaze, warm the water and marmalade or jam in a medium saucepan over a medium heat. Generously brush the glaze over the buns. You can hold on to any spare for later use as it will keep for several days. To make the icing, whisk together the icing sugar and water in a small bowl or measuring jug until it forms a silky paste. Once the buns are completely cool, drizzle over the icing. Makes 1 quantitylukewarm whole milk 200mlinstant dried yeast 7g (2 tsp or a whole sachet)strong white bread flour or plain flour 500gcaster sugar 80g for a sweet dough or 10g for a savoury doughfine sea salt 10geggs 2soft unsalted butter 125g, cubed Gently warm the milk in a small saucepan. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the yeast. Set aside and leave to bubble for 5 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Make a small well in the flour, pour in the milk and yeast mixture, crack in the eggs and stir together until it forms a rough dough. Tip the dough on to a lightly floured work surface and either knead by hand for 10 minutes or in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook for 4-5 minutes, gradually working the cubes of butter into the dough as you knead until it is soft, silky and stretchy. Pop the dough back into the bowl, place a damp tea towel or shower cap over the rim and leave to prove for 1 hour until the dough has almost doubled in size. Alternatively, refrigerate the dough (still covered) overnight, ready to bake the next day. If you can plan for this extra proving time, it really helps as the dough is much easier to work with when cold. Breadsong by Kitty Tait & Al Tait (Bloomsbury, £20).

4/24/2022,"Authorities say fire alarms were working at an Adelaide hotel where a blaze broke out causing injuries to seven people, despite some guests saying they did not hear the alarm. More than 40 firefighters rushed to the Comfort Hotel Adelaide Meridien on Melbourne Street in North Adelaide after a fire broke out about 6.30am. Fifteen people required rescuing, including some who were stranded on hotel balconies, and a man who jumped into the hotel pool after acquiring serious burns to his hands and feet.

A front desk worker at the hotel also told Guardian Australia that he heard the alarms. “I can say for an absolute fact I was the first person on-site there to work this morning and the fire alarms were all working. And there was a lot of noise so I can definitely counteract that,” he said. While he did not wish to go into more details he also provided the hotel’s official statement. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “All guests are safe and accounted for. We thank the police and the fire people for the quick response and assistance, and the fire was contained to one room.” The MFS spokesperson said that while the fire was contained to the room of origin, smoke spread through “pretty much the whole motel”. “So there will be smoke damage … Because it’s a commercial building it will need a structural assessment. So, yes, the fire was contained to the one room, but how much structural damage has been done, they won’t know that until an engineer comes in to do that assessment,” she said. #BREAKING: Seven people have been taken to hospital, one in a critical condition, after a fire broke out in a North Adelaide hotel room. #9Newshttps://t.co/sgFx2vPUqq pic.twitter.com/gGUbWwyz0P Multiple guests told media outlets on the scene that they did not hear the hotel’s fire alarms during the emergency. “There was no fire or smoke alarms going off and no instructions over the PA system,” guest Darren Whitfield told the Advertiser newspaper. “There were no visible exit signs through the smoke … I could see people crawling on the floor in really thick smoke … I let them into our room … They were covered in black soot and coughing really badly.” Others told the ABC that they were alerted to the fire after hearing banging and popping, and the sound of other guests yelling. Despite SA police previously suggesting that the fire may have been purposefully lit, a spokesperson for the city’s fire service said that investigations had concluded that the cause was accidental. SA police superintendent, Matt Nairn, confirmed that residents from all of the 95 occupied rooms at the time had been accounted for. “Seven people have gone to hospital at the stage … One had relatively severe burns but the rest have just got fire associated medical conditions,” he told media. “We’ve got one gentleman with hands and feet burns, we’ve got some that have gone to the hospital for smoke inhalation.” 7 people have been taken to hospital, including a man suffering serious burns who jumped into a pool before authorities arrived. @9NewsAdel pic.twitter.com/LrhW8RnQjj Nairn confirmed that arrangements were already being made to find alternative accommodation for the rest of the guests. “We’re working with the management for the establishment to actually help them re-establish, rehouse and get people out,” he said.",News/Australia news,Firefighters rescue 15 people from burning Adelaide hotel as authorities respond to alarm concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/24/firefighters-rescue-15-people-from-burning-adelaide-hotel-as-authorities-respond-to-alarm-concerns
4/24/2022,"Where is America’s southern border? Look on a map and you can see the line where America ends and Mexico begins, a line along part of which Donald Trump tried to build his wall. Justin Campbell will tell you that the maps are wrong, or at least disclose only half the story. He is a historian and former US soldier who served with Joint Task Force Six (now called Joint Task Force North). It is a military unit initially set up in 1989 to wage the “war on drugs”, then, after 9/11, to combat terrorism, too, and now also to stem migration. America’s southern border, Campbell insists, does not simply lie on that line where the US meets Mexico. It lies also 1,500 miles to the south where Mexico meets Guatemala. Here, as at the US-Mexico border, there are American troops and border force police to monitor migrants coming through. Any who are thought to be heading for the US are immediately apprehended. The US border lies a thousand miles farther south, too, where Guatemala meets Honduras. Here, too, the US forces carry out operations to stop possible migrants to the United States. “The US-Mexico, Mexico-Guatemala and Guatemala-Honduras borders,” Campbell told journalist Todd Miller for his book Empire of Borders, are all part of “a border set… where all borders face south… and try to prevent the same things going north”. One can similarly ask: where is the European Union’s southern border? Just as the US border stretches into Central America and beyond, so the EU border extends further south than the Mediterranean coast of Spain, France, Italy, Malta and Greece, reaching out into Africa. The EU pays millions of euros to dictators and warlords, militias and criminal gangs in north Africa, the Sahel, and the Horn of Africa to act as immigration police, to hunt down and detain potential migrants to Europe. The EU’s former special representative for the Sahel, Ángel Losada, calls it “Europe’s new forward border”. Britain’s recent migration deal with Rwanda has generated much controversy. It is an obnoxious arrangement, not even a policy of offshore processing, but, rather, of mass deportation. The deal, however, did not emerge out of nothing. It is the latest move in what Alan Bersin, former commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, calls a “massive paradigm change” in western perceptions of borders. For western governments, Bersin argues, borders are no longer lines to “demarcate… one sovereignty from another” but are seen, rather, as “movements – flows of people and goods on a global scale”. Rich countries seek not to defend sovereignty at a line on the map but to manage those flows by extending sovereignty across the globe. As Miller details in his book, US troops and border police are to be found not just in Central America but in Ecuador and Kenya, Kazakhstan and the Philippines, stemming potential migration to America through a global operation. There has in recent years been a fierce debate in the west about the “migration crisis” and how best to protect borders, defend sovereignty and insulate itself from that crisis. One of the ironies is that the protection of the borders of rich countries now requires them to trample all over the borders of poor countries. It is a new form of imperialism, in which immigration controls become the means of defending the sovereignty of rich nations through undermining that of poorer ones. “Nonsense”, respond the defenders of the globalised immigration controls. “Poor countries may be poor but they are independent, capable of making their own decisions. Mexico is freely accepting US border police on its territory. Niger is voluntarily acting on behalf of the EU. Rwanda is willingly taking on more refugees.” The nations of the world do not, though, all make decisions on equal terms. Mexico, Niger and Rwanda are sovereign nations but they don’t have much leeway when negotiating with the US or the EU or the UK, any more than when Amazon warehouse workers or P&O staff sign contracts promising pitiful wages and abysmal conditions, they do so truly out of choice. The market and the global economy can hide myriad forms of coercion behind the rhetoric of “free choice” and “sovereignty”. The reason that Niger is “Europe’s migration laboratory” is that it is among the poorest countries in the world. It is also the largest per capita recipient of EU aid. In return for that aid, the Niger authorities have to shape domestic policies to fit the EU’s migration needs. So, Niger’s economy has become distorted and its citizens are prevented from travelling freely within their own country. The EU makes all aid conditional on support for its migration prevention policies. Niger signed a treaty with the EU, but its sovereignty was barely visible when it did so. Or take Rwanda. Ever since Britain signed the deportation deal, rightwing commentators, such as the Tory peer Daniel Hannan, have suddenly discovered their love of Rwanda as a “safe and prosperous country” and have condemned critics of the scheme as demonstrating “racist attitudes” and promoting “stereotypes about Africa”. Rwanda has recovered remarkably well from the genocide of 1994 and has made huge economic strides. It remains, though, among the 25 poorest countries in the world. Britain’s per capita GDP is more than 50 times greater than Rwanda’s. Rwanda had every right to sign the deal. But let us not pretend that when Priti Patel and the Rwandan foreign minister, Vincent Biruta, met across the negotiating table, they did so as representatives of equal powers. Or ignore Rwanda’s human rights record or President Paul Kagame’s refusal to tolerate opposition. Or wonder why it is assumed that Britain cannot cope with any more asylum seekers but Rwanda, which already hosts five times as many refugees per capita as the UK, and with a population density almost twice as great, can do so. Britain has the economic clout to transport its “problem” away and Rwanda’s government has both the economic need for the cash and the political desire, given its human rights image, to appear humanitarian. And, in the process, migrants are turned into commodities to be traded on the global stage, victims of a new imperialism in which immigration controls have become a means of dividing the world into rich, gated nations and poorer ones that take care of the west’s unwanted.
