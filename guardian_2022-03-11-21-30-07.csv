3/11/2022,"Mary Coombs, who has died aged 93, was the first woman in the world trained to program a computer for business applications. She worked on the Lyons Electronic Office – Leo – the computer built in the early 1950s by the catering company J Lyons & Co to automate the back office for its national chain of 250 teashops, three vast Corner Houses in London, and sales of cakes, tea and ice-cream. In 2001, old Leo hands celebrated the 50th anniversary of the world’s first computerised office job, Bakery Valuations, which ran on Leo as a routine application starting in November 1951. The anniversary brought Coombs’ role into the public eye for the first time. With her astonishingly detailed memory, sharp mind and engaging personality, she found herself frequently called upon to give interviews for print, radio and television, helping to bring back to life a largely forgotten episode in the history of British computing. Leo was the brainchild of a Lyons manager, John Simmons, who persuaded the board to fund a computer for the company soon after the second world war. At the time, computers were seen as scientific tools – it was revolutionary to imagine that they could take on stock control, distribution, payroll, even tea blending, previously carried out by hand. Lyons bought the technology from Cambridge University by funding the development of Edsac (Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator), one of the first British scientific computers, building its own machine and developing business applications. Coombs’ father was a medical officer at Lyons. She was a management trainee in the statistical office when a memo came round inviting staff to sign up for a “computer appreciation course”. She was intrigued, attended the intensive programme of lectures and assignments, and was almost immediately offered a job as a programmer. Only one of the other 10 participants, Frank Land, passed muster, starting a few months after Coombs. The room-sized computer, based on thermionic valves and inherently unreliable, was not fully ready until December 1953. Coombs spent her first months writing test programs, often working with the engineers until well after midnight to solve problems (one turned out to be because of interference from the managers’ lift). Payroll for Lyons’ 10,000 employees was the next big task. The program, written in a simple alphanumeric code, had to produce payslips in pre-decimal currency, taking into account tax deductions, loans to the employee, holiday and sick pay, and calculating the denominations of cash needed to go into pay packets. Coombs later did the same for the Ford motor company, one of many queueing up to use Leo. In 1954 Lyons set up Leo Computers Ltd and started making computers for sale. The senior systems analysts became “consultants” responsible for designing systems for customers as well as for making sales. Her former classmate on the appreciation course, Land, became one of them, but Coombs was never offered a management position. “I always had a shrewd suspicion that I was too useful to be promoted to management,” she told an interviewer from the British Library’s Voices of Science project. Training and supervising a pool of programmers, she specified payroll programs for a consortium of London local authorities, and spent time in the offices of British Oxygen, valiantly trying to produce programs to a specification (drawn up by the company’s planners, who knew nothing about computers) that she had said from the start was far too complicated. When Leo produced its first transistor machine, Leo III, Coombs translated programs from machine code into the English-based programming language then in use. She loved the job. It was “wildly exciting”, she recalled. “If I hadn’t enjoyed myself so much … I would have balked at the relatively low pay, you know … It was really great fun.” Born in Muswell Hill, north London, Mary was the elder daughter of Ruth (nee Petri) and William Blood, then a GP. She had a sister, also named Ruth. Mary attended Putney high school and St Paul’s girls’ school in Hammersmith. Although she had excelled at maths, she chose to read French and history at the then Queen Mary College, London. After graduating, she taught English and took secretarial courses in Lausanne, Switzerland, for a year, returning to England in August 1952 intending to teach French. All the teaching posts had been filled, so she took the “temporary” job at Lyons that led to Leo. She married John Coombs, a fellow programmer, in 1955. Their daughter, Anne, was born in 1961, and they adopted three further children, Andrew, Paul and Gillian. Leo Computers eventually became part of ICL, and Coombs continued to be employed by the company part-time until 1969, working at home editing computer manuals. Anne had been born with a developmental disorder, and she died of pneumonia at only six. After stopping work for three years Coombs returned to her original ambition, qualifying to work as a primary school teacher until her post was axed in a round of cuts. Versatile, quick to learn and hating to be out of a job, she then worked as an equipment buyer for a water treatment company until she retired at 64. At different times Coombs ran a cub scouts troop, taught music, played the church organ, took Sunday school classes, and volunteered for the Spastics Society (now Scope). “I was always worried about running out of things to do,” she told the British Library interviewer. John died in 2012. Mary is survived by Andrew, Paul and Gillian, by three grandchildren, Grace, Jemma and John, and by Ruth.

3/11/2022,"The minister for veterans has written to military charities seeking their help in making sure former UK service personnel do not travel to Ukraine to fight against Russia, in the latest government warning against this happening. It comes after Boris Johnson said that anyone still serving UK military who went to Ukraine would face a court martial upon their return, and added that civilians should avoid travelling to the country. The minister, Leo Docherty, said that while the invasion was likely to provoke strong feelings, veterans should focus on activities such as helping charities. The comments are yet another official pushback against those by Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, who said at the end of last month that she would back Britons going to Ukraine to help fight the Russians. Truss was criticised by a number of MPs and rapidly contradicted by other ministers. Her comment that she would “absolutely” support the idea of people wanting to volunteer to help the Ukrainians fight also ran counter to her department’s official advice on travel to Ukraine. Docherty said he was aware that coverage of the Russian invasion “has rightly brought out strong feelings of support for the Ukrainian people. “Veterans always step up in times of need, but they must channel their skills, experience and passion into legal routes of support for Ukraine and not engage in the conflict,” he said. “There are many ways that we all can support the people of Ukraine, including through donating money to charity.” The letter to military charities says they can ask for help from the Office for Veterans’ Affairs and the Ministry of Defence if they learn about veterans seeking to travel to Ukraine. On Thursday, Johnson was asked about reports that a 19-year-old from Warrington with no military experience had travelled to Ukraine. “I think that everybody seeing what’s happening in Ukraine will understand those feelings,” the prime minister said. “I think many people, many people in our armed forces, will sympathise because I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a clear distinction in international affairs between right and wrong and good and evil in what President Putin is doing to people in Ukraine. “But we have very clear laws in this country. You shouldn’t go to Ukraine, and I’m afraid people going from our armed services, as the chief of the defence staff made clear the other day, will face court martial.”",News/UK news,Minister asks military charities to help ensure British veterans don’t fight in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/11/minister-asks-military-charities-to-help-ensure-british-veterans-dont-fight-in-ukraine
3/11/2022,"After all the abstract chat and whispers from the sidelines, a tangible proposal: Tony Blair wants to return to advise the next Labour government. As the notion gains currency, much of the country cheers; the rest of it jeers. What is it about this man that engenders such love and loathing, and would it be good for Labour or the country if he returned? The first point to make after the New Statesman’s scoop – the fruit of a conversation between Blair and the actor/guest editor Michael Sheen – is that he almost certainly is advising already, either directly or through intermediaries such as Peter Mandelson, who is known to be close to Keir Starmer’s key fixer Morgan McSweeney. Other older New Labour hands are back at the centre of things, not least Deborah Mattinson, who is Starmer’s head of strategy, and Matthew Doyle, who serves as executive director of communications for Starmer, having previously fulfilled a PR role for Blair. But you don’t need to be told that: you just have to see how Starmer’s operation is mimicking the Blair playbook on issues such as crime and public spending. Perhaps most telling is that last November, Blair in effect anointed Starmer at a private north London gathering. Now the question is how close Blair gets to the levers of power. Why Blair, and why now? The man still fascinates, repels and attracts because he is such a class act. After everything, and whatever we think, he is compelling. He thinks big and he has an argument that he prosecutes with sublime skill. A narrative twinned with easy charm and supreme confidence is a winning hand. We know the mantra “Lost, lost, lost, Blair, Blair, Blair, lost, lost, lost”. Blair is a winner, so let’s have him back, right? But first, let’s stop and think. It’s true that, in their time and in their different ways, Blair and Gordon Brown bestrode the land. A small handful of politicians have done so in the last few decades: Thatcher, Johnson, Sturgeon and, yes, Nigel Farage. Politics abhors a vacuum, and in a moment of multiple crises there is a temptation to grab nostalgically from the past. But it would be as if, in 1994 – when Blair became Labour leader – the party had turned to Harold Wilson to light the way forward. Blair, like every politician, is a product of his moment. His moment was an era defined by the country meeting the limits of raw Thatcherism, a benign economy that by 2007 had grown for 60 consecutive quarters, a kingdom still largely united, Britain’s place in Europe secure, the west triumphant over the Soviet Union, and the climate crisis as yet barely registering. What’s more, Labour could still claim to be the left’s one big tent. Of course, Blair achieved many good things in terms of child poverty reduction and public service investment. But he seems to have no self-awareness – even now – that letting the City of London do whatever it wanted helped crash the economy in 2008, or that allowing productive migrants into the country might cause tensions without enough good jobs, houses or schools to ease the transition. And all that’s before you get to the Iraq war and the way that toxified the public realm – not least in the context of another illegal invasion now. All this and more paved the way to Tory rule, austerity, Brexit, the desire for Scottish independence and the loss of the red wall. Blair thrived in an era that has gone. The long-term consensus, buy-in and active participation we will need to solve many issues, including the climate transition, demand very different skills – not so much to persuade people, but to help them collectively to help themselves. It’s not that Blair isn’t brilliant at politics, in the sense that he is a master at playing the game – he is. It’s that he has had his go, and it largely failed and helped leave us in the mess we are now in. It’s a different system we need: Blair was the last shining star of an old politics whose time is up. We should learn from his professionalism, his verve and his ability to connect to people but use such skills to take people on a journey of change in which they create that better future. Because in our complex and interdependent world, as we are learning from Covid, climate and Ukraine, it’s the only way it will happen. A party in cultural crisis that looks back, not forward, is doomed to fail. Someone knew that in 1994. Thanks, Tony – and no thanks.

3/11/2022,"The daughter of Sergei Lavrov’s alleged mistress should be among the family members of Vladimir Putin’s associates targeted with sanctions, MPs and campaigners have said. The Russian foreign minister’s “second family”, including Svetlana Polyakova, his alleged mistress, and Polina Kovaleva, her 26-year-old daughter, were identified as among those officials should look at, the Daily Telegraph reported. As Roman Abramovich was added to the sanction list on Thursday, MPs questioned why the government’s list was still dwarfed by the hundreds of individuals and entities sanctioned by the EU and the US. Layla Moran MP, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for foreign affairs and international development, told the Daily Telegraph: “The government is still way behind the EU and the US. The legislation hasn’t passed yet, so if they can act against Abramovich now, why not the others?” Moran called for action against 35 named “key enablers” of Putin in the House of Commons last month, including Abramovich and Oleg Deripaska, who was also added to the UK sanction list on Thursday. But many others on that list have been sanctioned in the EU or US but not in the UK. This includes Viktor Zolotov, the head of Russia’s national guard whose family is one of the richest in Russia in the real estate sector; Anton Vaino, Putin’s chief of staff; and Mikhail Mishustin, the Russian prime minister. Moran told the Telegraph that officials should also look at “the family and friends” of Putin’s associates, as “one of the ways that they get around sanctions is to transfer funds and assets to family members”. “They should be included in the list and ideally it should be automatic,” she said. Maria Pevchikh, the head of investigations at Alexei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, named members of Lavrov’s family including Polyakova and Kovaleva, who owns a flat in Kensington, west London, as those who should have their assets frozen, the Telegraph reported. Her calls were backed by MP Chris Bryant. Polyakova, an actor and restaurateur, is reported to have been in a relationship with Lavrov since the early 2000s and documents unearthed by the foundation show she has been abroad with the foreign minister more than 60 times, including on diplomatic missions. Her family’s lifestyle and growing multi-million-pound property portfolio is alleged to have been bankrolled by her lover.

3/11/2022,"Woman, Eating by Claire Kohda (Virago, £14.99)A young artist arrives in London for an internship at a prestigious gallery. Without enough money for another room, she plans to sleep on the floor of her unfurnished studio. Lydia is the daughter of a Japanese father and a half-British, half-Malaysian mother, but what really sets her apart is that she’s a vampire. After her vampire mother vowed never to kill another human being, the two of them survived on fresh pigs’ blood, but alone in London, Lydia struggles to find nourishment. Blood sausage barely staves off the pangs, and she can’t digest the oats. As her hunger grows, she imagines she might starve out the vampire part of herself; watching food videos online, she considers her heritage: “In most Asian cultures … there is no reverence for the vampiric monster as there is in the West; most blood-sucking things are women … ” The most unusual, original and strikingly contemporary vampire novel to come along in years. Lambda by David Musgrave (Europa, £12.99)This impressive debut by a visual artist is set in an alternate 2019, in a Britain slightly different from our own. Object Relation laws have granted rights to smart machines (including talking toothbrushes), cyber-attacks are not so much terrorism as “a business plan that leverages the threat of mass murder”, and a different race of beings has been part of the population for half a century. Tiny, air-breathing aquatic mammals, the lambda arrive by sea in small groups, quickly learn English, and form an accepted, if mysterious, class, living in flooded basements, transported by terrestrial humans in fishbowls to offices to do menial jobs. But when a school bombing is blamed on the Army of Lambda Ascension, acceptance turns to hate. An imaginative revisioning of some of today’s fears and fantasies, written with bravura style and wit, this is literary SF at its best. Plutoshine by Lucy Kissick (Gollancz, £16.99)Thanks to the inventions of Clavius Harbour, “the most powerful maverick in the solar system”, 100 scientists and engineers have moved into a habitat on dark and distant Pluto, 4bn miles from the sun, to begin the long process of terraforming. Yet someone is trying to sabotage the mission. Harbour’s 10-year-old daughter Nou holds a vital clue, but she’s too traumatised by a near fatal accident to speak. Can the gentle Lucian, the “sun-bringer” who devised their solar mirror project, win her trust, solve the mystery and save the world? The author has a doctorate in planetary geochemistry, and clearly knows her stuff. The science has the ring of truth, and depictions of what it could be like on Pluto are thrillingly vivid. The tale itself is curiously old-fashioned, reminiscent of a book for children in the ease with which a child can go out into the airless, frozen world alone, the absence of sex, the excitement around baked goods, and a general cosy retro-Englishness. But it’s a rousing good story, perhaps best enjoyed with a nice cuppa and a piece of cake. The Kaiju Preservation Society by John Scalzi (Tor, £16.99)Kaiju, Japanese for “strange creature”, refers both to a film genre and the gigantic monsters it features. The premise of Scalzi’s latest novel is that Godzilla was a real creature that broke through from another dimension before dying, and the body of the gigantic beast inspired the first of the Japanese monster movies. The atomic bomb and early nuclear explosions had the effect of thinning the barrier between our world and that of the kaiju. Something there set life on a dramatically different course, unhindered by the square-cube law that determines the largest size a living creature can be on Earth. To protect our world and keep the kaiju where they belong, the titular society was established; but others have come to know about it, not all of whom have the best interests of either world at heart. Hugely enjoyable, intelligent and good-humoured fun. The Way of the Worm by Ramsey Campbell (Flame Tree, £9.95)The concluding volume of the Three Births of Daoloth trilogy brings the story of Dominic Sheldrake’s lifelong struggle against a sinister cult into the present day. The cult has become a worldwide religion, the Church of the Eternal Three, and Dom’s own son is a member. The previous book held out the faint possibility that Dom had been driven mad by his own paranoid obsession, but this astonishing, apocalyptic conclusion does not. Although now better known for his subtler evocations of unease, Campbell’s early stories were heavily influenced by HP Lovecraft. Here he returns to his roots, even outdoing Lovecraft in his depictions of full-on cosmic terror.",Arts/Books,"The best recent science fiction, fantasy and horror – reviews roundup",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/11/the-best-recent-science-fiction-fantasy-and-horror-reviews-roundup
3/11/2022,"It takes a considerable amount of French swagger to turn up in London and rebrand afternoon tea, but if anyone can do it, Cédric Grolet is the man. Grolet is one of the greatest patissiers currently walking the Earth. I say one of, because the maker of the world’s most exquisite Paris-Brest or best mille-feuille is a highly contestable matter, but Grolet is definitely in the frame. Having started out at the age of 11 in the kitchen of his grandparents’ hotel in the Loire valley, Grolet was winning awards for sugar art by 15, before going on to work at Fauchon and Le Meurice, both in Paris. This diminutive, sugar-fuelled powerhouse was soon taking on the globe with his increasingly famous trompe-l’oeil artistry. I’ll translate: his specialities include a lemon cake that resembles a lemon and a hazelnut tart that looks remarkably like a hazelnut. He was deemed best head patissier in France in 2015, 2016 and 2017, and a year later won the title of the world’s best pastry chef at the 50 Best awards. Grolet’s bid to spike the blood sugar levels of metropolitan Europe has seen him open a sort-of cafe, sort-of cake laboratory in Knightsbridge, and serve not strictly afternoon tea, but “gouter”, or taster. He has always felt that his work is at its very best seconds after all the piping, spinning, spraying and tweezering finishes, so now customers can sit up and enjoy viennoiseries, cookies and a few savoury items at the counter in this starkly pretty, Rémi Tessier-designed lab area full of white marble, polished stainless steel, shiny, scallop floor tiles and walls carved with flowers and lemons. Or you can sit in a more hotel-lobby-feeling, cushioned area for the gouter menu, for which the tea is served in black cups with no handles, because, well, we’re not in Betty’s tea rooms any more. Obviously, the French would never do anything as gauche or wantonly pleasurable as sit down at 3pm with a heaving cake stand of egg-and-cress finger sandwiches, fairy cakes and trifle, before eating until they’re edging on bilious. Instead, Grolet’s afternoon tea dances with the French idea of bridging the gap between a fine lunch and a proper dinner with a series of small, yet meaningful sweet tastes, just as French parents do for small children. Grolet’s gouter menu, a snip at £90, including tea or coffee, takes place in the Berkeley hotel and features five mini-versions of his classic creations: petite hazelnut, petite lemon, petite Paris-Brest flower, a vanilla flower and his take on the British scone. A Frenchman wading into the UK’s fractious “jam or cream first?” scone debate is either foolhardy or admirable, but Grolet has form. Back in 2017, he released a recipe for scones with a crumble topping, seemingly believing that crunchy scones were something Britain lacked. He may as well have gone to the Tower of London and shooed off the ravens, although I can’t help but sigh at his panache. These days, Grolet’s “scone” has an added layer of marmalade and the toppings are baked within, giving it a similar shape and vibe, but not taste, to a Mr Kipling fondant fancy. Grolet is currently on hand in his new Knightsbridge cafe to explain and justify his techniques, which meant that, on the day I visited, the place was bedlam, with him meeting and greeting a queue of customers snaking down the road all urgently needing to part with £25 for a single full-sized vanilla flower cake. At this point, you might ask: “But how can a cake cost this much, when a Greggs yum yum is about 85p and delivers a satisfying whack of pillowy doughnut without any need to remortgage the house?” This is where Grolet’s laboratory comes into its own, because you can watch him take a wafer-thin pastry case, fill it with a delicate layer of pale vanilla ganache, load in a disc of light, vanilla-scented sponge, brush it lovingly with glossy huile vanille, pipe in the best praline I will ever taste, then leave it all to set, before icing it with mousse vanille in ornate, perfect, concentric petals and creating something that’s almost too beautiful to push down one’s throat. It is impossible to begrudge Grolet his money for this experience. There’s a wonderful video floating around the internet right now in which crafters, designers and artists post videos of the laborious process behind their magical finished products, all accompanied by a chipper song with the lyrics, “It costs that much ’cause it takes me fucking hours! It costs that much ’cause I don’t have superpowers”, and this is very much the case here. Grolet’s souffle, waffle flower and marble flower cake cost 25 quid a pop because they’re not made by machine, or by invisible pixies, but by living, breathing technicians who take spreading marmalade on a scone as seriously as building a Formula One car. Grolet has arrived in London, shaken up afternoon tea and convinced me that £90 is a perfectly reasonable price for five small tarts and a glass of Laurent-Perrier, before sending me off so giddy on praline and huile vanille that I immediately booked his £135 “chef’s choice” tasting menu experience. Grolet is outrageous on many levels, but he does it so very sweetly.  Cédric Grolet at the Berkeley Wilton Place, London SW1. Open all week, 8am-6pm.

3/11/2022,"Amass movement of people driven from their homes by environmental catastrophe and hoping for a fresh start in a new land: there’s a sad familiarity to the events depicted in John Steinbeck’s Pulitzer prize-winning novel from 1939 in which the Joad family, tenant farmers from Oklahoma, are forced to leave their farm due to drought and financial hardship. They set off for California where they have heard there are jobs aplenty, but when they arrive they find thousands of fellow migrants living in desperate poverty. The newcomers are exploited by the rich, abandoned by the authorities, and treated with suspicion and hostility by locals. “Okie use’ ta mean you was from Oklahoma,” laments one Dust Bowl migrant. “Now it means you’re a dirty son-of-a-bitch. Okie means you’re scum. Don’t mean nothing itself, it’s the way they say it.” Marking 120 years since Steinbeck’s birth, this new recording is narrated by the actor Richard Armitage, whose tone is sturdy but solemn, and who expertly navigates the midwest dialect and the book’s multiple voices. Chief among the protagonists is Tom Joad, the second of the six Joad children, who is newly paroled from prison after a four-year stretch for manslaughter, and shocked to find his family packing up to leave. There is also Ma Joad, determined, dignified and resilient in the face of turmoil; Pa Joad, big-hearted but broken by all that has befallen the family; and Jim Casy, a former preacher and the beating heart of Steinbeck’s book, who challenges injustice at devastating personal cost.

3/11/2022,"This is a perilous time for the Oscars. Last year’s ceremony – held in a train station, don’t forget – was watched by just a tiny dribble of viewers. This year, the lack of a televised Golden Globes has hobbled awards season, and anticipation is at an all-time low. The Academy’s plan to lure viewers by handing out a bunch of awards off-screen has been widely criticised by the film-making community. Simply put, things are getting desperate. But we’ve all thrown parties without knowing whether anyone will actually turn up, and the Oscars are currently doing the most sensible thing possible: they’re focusing on the catering. A press release announced that the menu at this year’s Governors Ball – essentially, the official afterparty that everyone pops into before heading on to other, better afterparties – will be a collaboration between Wolfgang Puck and the “Bronx-based culinary collective” Ghetto Gastro. As the release put it: “Merging food, fashion, music, art and design, Ghetto Gastro’s work masterfully blends influences from the African diaspora, global south ingredients and hip-hop to create offerings that address race, identity and economic empowerment.” Not to be down on the sentiment, but a large proportion of the Governors Ball attendees will be millionaires who just lost out on an award in front of a global audience. Is there a demographic less likely to appreciate a mixed-media food selection designed to address identity and economic empowerment? But it’s OK, because if Ghetto Gastro doesn’t float everyone’s boat, guests can eat the food prepared by Wolfgang Puck’s team, which is said to include “spicy tuna cones” and “smoked salmon Oscars”. Not everyone at the Governors Ball can win an Oscar, but they can eat a slice of fish that looks a bit like an Oscar. You can’t help feeling, though, that none of these offerings will go down particularly well. You don’t have to be an Academy Awards historian to know that the best part of any Oscar night is when someone gets the burgers out. This tends to happen at the Vanity Fair party and, when it does, it’s like feeding time at the zoo. After all, what are the Oscars if not the culmination of a season during which hundreds of already thin people have denied themselves calories in an effort to squeeze into uncomfortably tight outfits? It sounds hellish. When Ellen DeGeneres hosted in 2014, there was a segment where pizzas were brought to the ceremony with great procession, and the cries of hungry delight from the assembled A-listers was chilling. So imagine how furiously the same people would fall on a plate of hamburgers when the cameras stop rolling. They deserve it, too. Those burgers are the real award. My advice for next year’s awards is to forget about Wolfgang Puck and Ghetto Gastro. Leave the salmon Oscars at home. Instead, let’s replace them with an all-you-can-eat carb station. Bread rolls fired out of T-shirt cannons. Troughs packed to the brim with mashed potatoes. A firehose that shoots a jet of hot rice pudding directly into the face of anyone who walks into the room. This is what Hollywood wants. This is what Hollywood needs. This, with no exaggeration, is the only thing that can save the Oscars. ",Arts/Film,Want to save the 2022 Oscars?

Growing up in a Hackney household soundtracked by her father’s Ghanian highlife music and her mum’s heavy rotation of MTV icons such as Kelis and Lil’ Kim has clearly rubbed off on Runway. Her approach is as eclectic as it is kinetic: new single Pressure is caramel-smooth pop; older number Big Racks merges extremely wonky synth bass with taut drums that nod to old-school funk and hyperpop, while the beat-heavy hip-hop of ATM features the kind of sharp hooks and joyous bounce that recall the heyday of Missy Elliott (who guests on the recorded version). There is a constant swing between fractured beats and euphoric surges as Runway unleashes potent rap, glistening pop melody and moments of thoughtful restraint. While the low-stage, low-ceiling basement venue isn’t the best for a performance this aesthetically charged and choreography-heavy – often only the top of the dancers’ swinging hair is visible – but the crowd soaks up every drop regardless. “I did not expect the vibe,” Runway announces as yet another wave of ecstatic screams rips through the venue. The room explodes once more to the polished yet punchy Hot Hot, while the final number – a new song, Somebody Like You – is a harmony-stacked slow groove that showcases her vocal range as it reaches soaring new levels. Replete with 80s stadium rock drums and ostentatious guitar solo outro, it is an almost ballad-like closer that further cements Bree Runway’s unique position as a rising pop star who eschews convention to embrace complexity and contradiction.",Arts/Music,Bree Runway review – the high-octane magic of a superstar in the making,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/11/bree-runway-review-manchester-academy
3/11/2022,"The Batman is stuffed with A-listers doing their damndest to bring something new to characters we’ve seen plenty of times before (the titular hero aside, Zoë Kravitz is the third actor to play Catwoman since 2004), perhaps the most interesting new direction in the film is for Gotham itself. The Batman was billed as a “journey into Gotham’s dark underbelly” and that’s certainly what we got, as the action moved between a seedy mob club, to a parking garage, to the Riddler’s gross incel flat, and back to the mob club again. (In order to convey the repetitiveness of real police work, about half of the three-hour movie is Batman going to the same place, to ask the same people, the same questions. Gritty.) Gotham on screen has always adapted to the needs of different film-makers: Tim Burton’s dark live-action cartoon meant lots of shootouts in schlocky alleys, while Christopher Nolan’s vision was heavily inspired by the grand scale of Los Angeles in Michael Mann’s Heat. For The Batman, Matt Reeves clearly wanted a more realistic take, one that evoked the city’s supposed New Jersey locale, although filming primarily took place in Chicago and Liverpool. DC’s major rivals, Marvel, generally opt to set things in real world settings, leading to the slightly ludicrous idea that New York is rebuilt every other blockbuster season. Marvel’s main contribution to our fictional geography comes in the shape of Birnin Zana, capital of Wakanda, and home to Black Panther. While the city’s prosperity and advanced tech is very much enabled by the local abundance of Vibranium — a fictional metal both harder and more expensive than diamond — that hasn’t stopped a number of real-world city planners trying to replicate its afro-futurist design. Not least the Senegalese-American singer Akon, who announced plans to build “Akon City“, a solar-powered “real-life” Wakanda on 2,000 acres of coastal land in Senegal. According to the Washington Post, he has secured $4bn of the $6bn investment necessary to build it. Such investment is, of course, helpful — but Akon’s idea is lacking the most crucial element for a fictional city. A cool name. King’s Landing, Hogsmeade, Bikini Bottom, Zion from the Matrix, The Capitol, all three of GTA’s main locations: Liberty City, Vice City and San Andreas. Hell, a trip to Houstatlantavegas, the composite stripper-city of Drake’s sordid imagination (where the lights are bright and the money’s so right) feels real enough after a long week at the grindstone. Perhaps the most famous of them all is Springfield. Despite being a cartoon city, with yellow inhabitants, it has come to represent “Anytown, USA” better than any real place ever could. Indeed, Matt Groening deliberately chose the name in the hope that “everyone will think it’s their Springfield” (there being at least 34 towns in 25 states with the name). And given its fame and its locations’ presence on everything from postcards to monopoly boards — there was even a replica Simpsons’ house in Nevada — it’s arguably as real a place as anywhere. But while Springfield may be the most iconic fictional conurbation, it is polluted, poorly run and employment opportunities are subject to the whims of an evil 104-year-old billionaire. So, like Gotham, it’s not somewhere you’d actually want to live. Sunnydale, a town that might be more to your taste – pretty decent unless you’re unlucky enough to be chosen to battle vampires (or you happen to be best mates with someone who is). Twin Peaks too has its charms, and Star Wars capital Coruscant looks exactly like the futuristic Rome you’d expect to be the seat of government for an intergalactic civilisation. That is until the prequels end of course. My personal pick? Hill Valley: the archetypal vision of 1950s California from Back to the Future. Who could say no to thick shakes, real fat burgers, and the chance to be the inventor of rock’n’roll? Not me.

3/11/2022,"As many as 10,000 migrant workers from south and south-east Asia die every year in the Gulf countries, according to a report by a group of human rights organisations. More than half of the deaths are unexplained, said the report, and are commonly recorded as due to “natural causes” or “cardiac arrest”. But Gulf states are failing properly to investigate why so many migrant workers are dying. The report, Vital Signs: The deaths of migrants in the Gulf, has been compiled by NGOs from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal and the Philippines, and FairSquare Projects, a London-based migrant rights organisation. Low-paid migrant workers in the Gulf are exposed to a series of risks to their health, including heat and humidity, air pollution, overwork and abusive working conditions, poor occupational health and safety practices, psychosocial stress and hypertension. Long hours of manual labour in searing temperatures can result in heat stress, which can lead to organ damage, the report said. Julhas Uddin, a 37-year-old man from Bangladesh, died in Saudi Arabia in October 2017 when a supervisor instructed him to enter a sewerage line without an oxygen cylinder. No investigation was conducted, and his death certificate states the cause as “heart and breathing stopped”. There are about 30 million migrants working in the Arab Gulf states – the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait. About 80% of these are employed in low-paid sectors such as construction, hospitality and domestic work, and come from poorer countries in Asia and Africa. “Despite the Gulf states’ practical dependence on their migrant workforces and the bolstering impact migrant worker remittances have on the economies of their homelands, both origin and Gulf states have for too long paid inadequate attention to ensuring they return home in good health,” said Anurag Devkota, a lawyer from Nepal’s Law and Policy Forum for Social Justice. “As a result far too many do not return home at all, or do so in coffins or body bags.” Despite widespread criticism of worker exploitation – notably in relation to Qatar’s preparations to host this year’s World Cup – the Gulf states have largely avoided structural labour reforms, and origin states have been unable to ensure proper protection for their nationals abroad. The governments of the six Gulf countries did not respond to requests for comment.",News/Global development,"Up to 10,000 Asian migrant workers die in the Gulf every year, claims report",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/11/up-to-10000-asian-migrant-workers-die-in-the-gulf-every-year-claims-report
3/11/2022,"As Diana Totok and her sister reached through the wire fence separating Romania from Ukraine to grasp her father’s hand, it occurred to her that she might never see him again. Ukraine’s new wartime laws barred their father, a pastor, from fleeing the country with them. Nevertheless, he promised his teenage daughters and wife, Svetlana, that they would meet again soon. “I was crying and having a panic attack … I was so frustrated and scared,” Totok says. “Still to this moment I’m not sure if I’m going to see him [again] or not.” Two weeks earlier the 19-year-old’s biggest worry had been making a good impression at her new internship. Now she had just a few seconds to say goodbye to her father, her country, and any semblance of the life she assumed she would have. The only way Totok could think to get through the moment was to film it. Not only did she want to bear witness to what was happening in Ukraine, but, since the start of the bombing days earlier, she had found it easier to process the horror she was seeing through a camera lens.

The video of the goodbye has been viewed more than 20m times. It shows her father leaning his face against the fence and kissing his daughters’ foreheads through a gap in the wire. The video cuts there. Totok saved the final goodbyes for the family alone. She and her sister, 17-year-old Darina, got on a train with their mother, travelling into the depths of Romania, praying that their father would live to see them again. Totok was at a sleepover at a friend’s house the night the Russian invasion began. “We woke up because her mum called us and she’s like: ‘Girls, the war has started, they’re bombing everywhere.’” When Totok learned that the military airbase in her city of Mykolaiv, near the Crimean border in the south, had been bombed, she knew she needed to get back to her family. “I was leaving my friend’s house and her last words to me were like, ‘Bye, don’t die!’ You know, it was kind of funny, but it’s not.” That night, all four Totoks crammed into the same bed trying to sleep, listening to planes overhead. “It was scary, we had all our clothes on, ready to go to the basement,” she says. It occurred to Totok then that what was happening to her deserved to be documented, so she pulled out her phone and started recording for the first time. “In the second world war, there was no gadgets and no filming … I knew that these videos would be like, historic,” she says. “I thought, ‘I’m going to show these videos to my kids and say that that’s what we had to go through’.” This article includes content provided by TikTok.

Totok is one of dozens of young people, mostly women, who have been sharing their daily lives in Ukraine on TikTok. Associate professor Aimée Morrison, an internet culture scholar at the University of Waterloo in Toronto, says that although wars have been documented on social media before, the video diary format of TikTok has made coverage in Ukraine feel more personal and immediate. “We imagine ourselves in the terrible situation they find themselves in, it becomes real to us,” she says. “Even the vertical orientation of [the] screen changes things … it feels like you’re friends with this person because they are close to the camera.” The comments on Totok’s TikToks reflect this intimate connection, telling her that they are praying for her family and father, and saying again and again how horrific the situation is. Unlike platforms such as Twitter or Instagram, which primarily show users content that people they already follow have liked or shared, TikTok is much less reliant on social networks. Its algorithm sends videos to people’s home screens, known as the “for you page”, based on their interests, pushing out high-performing content far and wide. “It’s absolutely going to change the way we think about conflict,” Morrison says. “War has traditionally been written as the history of great men making military decisions.” This article includes content provided by TikTok.

On the second day of the war, Totok’s parents decided they needed to get their girls across the border. This was another moment Totok filmed: throwing clothes in a bag, pausing in fear every time a plane flew overhead. As the realisation sank in for her that she was leaving her pets and home of 16 years behind, she began to cry. But rather than hiding it, she left the camera running. Morrison says there is “a power” in the victims of war making the world “bear witness to what they are going through”. “So much of what we’re seeing online now has been described in the past as [the] collateral damage of war … but that’s people’s lives and the collateral damage can speak back now,” she says.

It’s what youth expression is built on,” she says. Diana, Darina and Svetlana are now living in a flat with a number of other refugees and the sisters have found ways to help other Ukrainians, even from across the border. “It’s crazy how many views [my videos] have, but it’s kind of cool, actually, because we are raising money. I put a link in my bio on my TikTok so people can donate,” says Totok. “I’ve got a lot of messages on Instagram … saying: ‘If you know someone, someone who’s at the border with, like, Poland, my family is ready to take in a family.’” All the while, the family try to keep in touch with their father. “We’re trying to call him at least like once every six or so hours, just so we know that he’s still alive, you know?” she says.

3/11/2022,"As the pale yellow glow of Brazil’s spring sun set over the Doce River on a Friday evening in October 2015, life for Jonathan Knowles was as good as it had ever been. The modest living he made from a water-valve business saw him end each working week in the same way, with his wife Sheila and their four-year-old son, Enzo. They would set out chairs in the garden of their two-bedroom home, a new-build on the outskirts of Governador Valedares, in the Minas Gerais region of the Brazilian countryside, where they would pick marinaded beef off the barbecue and screen 80s music videos from a projector on to a wall. “We adored our life,” recalls Knowles, a Yorkshireman who moved to Brazil for love. A week later, at 3.45pm on 5 November, the Fundão tailings dam burst in the city of Mariana, 150 miles away, unleashing about 40m cubic metres of toxic mining waste into the Doce (“sweet”) River visible from their home, killing 19 people, rendering hundreds homeless and triggering the country’s biggest environmental disaster. Villages, livelihoods, farms, fish and wildlife were obliterated. It destroyed, damaged or contaminated everything in its path, law courts have since heard. Torrents of polluted water ran for 650km (400 miles) into the Atlantic Ocean, taking an estimated £2.5bn toll on the region’s biodiversity and leaving behind a cleanup that is expected to take more than a decade. “Life was phenomenal – until it became about survival,” says Knowles, 57, who is among more than 200,000 people bringing a $6.9bn (£5bn) lawsuit – among the biggest group actions in English legal history – against the Anglo-Australian mining multinational BHP, which owned Samarco jointly with the Brazilian iron-ore mining giant Vale. The case is due to be reheard in the court of appeal next month, in the latest stage in a three-and-a-half year legal fight on British soil that seeks “full and fair redress” on behalf of more than 190,000 individuals, 530 businesses, 150 members of Krenak indigenous communities, 25 municipalities and 15 faith-based institutions, including the Roman Catholic archdiocese of Mariana. For the victims, it is an “opportunity for real justice”, the region’s attorney general, Frederico de Assis Faria, said last year. For Knowles, the sight of the river immediately after the disaster left an indelible mark: “The water was brown like thick, chocolate soup; a mud avalanche. It came like tidal waves. As the days progressed, the whole surface as far as you could see became a blanket of dead fish. Cows and horses floated lifeless on their backs, only their legs visible above the water. “That water used to be everything. It’s where people gathered to fish, for hang-gliding and water sports, to walk and run at weekends. Ten different varieties of mango grew from its fertile banks; monkeys lived on an island in its centre.” After the collapse, it became a place to fear, he says. “Even now, six years on, you can put a magnet in a plastic bag and if you touch the mud around the river, it sticks.” Knowles and Brazilian-born Sheila met in Harrogate, England, in 2009 when she was a passenger on the bus he drove. They moved to Brazil the following year, while she was pregnant with Enzo: “We settled in the middle of nowhere. The land is as flat as a pancake apart from one huge mountain which sits, like a pimple, on the outskirts. “The mile-wide river snakes its way through the landscape and the area has its own unique climate. A constant, still warmth beats from the ground.” Knowles, who worked in construction, arrived in Brazil during a building boom. In March 2015, he began importing valves he had developed to help local people regulate fluctuating water bills. By September – two months before the dam collapse – he had sold a quarter of his stock and broken even. News of the disaster came early in the morning of 6 November. “In the village, life-changing events were announced by a car providing information by Tannoy. It was first thing in the morning and we were indoors. I stepped into the front yard and recognised the description, in Portuguese, of an avalanche of water. Then came a word I hadn’t heard before – ‘barragem’, Portuguese for dam.” Residents were instructed to store water in baths, basins and containers to last a month. “We filled a 1,000-litre bin and, a few weeks later, another 2,000 litres from a well out of town. For six weeks, we showered in buckets, used bottled water for brushing our teeth, washing and boiling vegetables, and used tap water for cleaning. Trucks offering free bottled water parked up each day and people queued down the street. “People stopped going out. The food hospitality industry halted. Starbucks stopped serving because they couldn’t wash the cups.” In the days that followed, scientists identified toxic metals including arsenic, mercury, nickel and aluminium in the water supply, which was swiftly treated. A December 2021 study of more than 300 people on the impact of those metals on the local population found an “elevated risk to the health of communities living in the surrounding areas”. It included reports of mental health disorders, skin lesions, gastrointestinal disorders, bone pain and malaise, all potentially linked to the disaster. Knowles remembers a push to get people to trust the water supply. “A lot of the population trust in God, and the church was encouraging people not to panic, but the writing was on the wall,” he says. “I could no longer trust that the water we drank and bathed in, the ground we walked on, was safe. Construction was halted and no one was buying water valves. My business would go; our money would run out.” Just after Christmas 2015, down to his final £1,000, Knowles bought a flight back to Harrogate in Yorkshire. He arrived in March 2016 with a suitcase and a credit card. Sheila and Enzo stayed in Brazil at her parents’ home. They joined him in England in 2018, as soon as he could afford the air fares. Knowles, who also has three grownup children and five grandchildren from his first marriage, says: “To leave my son in Brazil ripped me apart inside. I was scared that if they didn’t leave, they would die. I had to go back to England and earn us money. I couldn’t sit around waiting for a miracle.” He took a washing-up job, living on £1 a day: “I would hang around the ‘sell-by’ shelf in Asda waiting for the final bits to be reduced to 10p. I’d fill my bag with whatever turned up. “I saved up to renew my bus and lorry licences, then got my old job back with the bus company. I was concentrating on survival; there was no time to fall to pieces.” He slept on a friend’s sofa, then rented a cheap spare room, where he still lives. Sheila, 52, and Enzo, now 10, live in a small rental 10 minutes away. It is the only living arrangement the family can afford. Knowles says: “Getting them to Britain was a huge step. Before they came, we’d communicate daily over WhatsApp. I’d try to explain to Sheila my longterm health fears for Enzo. People were sharing images on social media groups of rashes they’d developed and fish with disfigurements you’d expect from a nuclear incident. I tried to explain that what affected fish today could have a legacy on humans in the future.” The court case, he says, is his only hope of reuniting his family under one roof. The legal fight was launched in 2018 by the international law firm PGMBM on behalf of its 200,000-plus claimants. The case was struck out by the high court in January 2021, after a challenge by BHP, and then by the court of appeal in March 2021, in support of BHP’s case that claims as well as a special compensation scheme were already under way in Brazil. However, appeal judges granted a rare opportunity to reopen the case last July, paving the way for another ruling, due in April. Judges described the case as one of “exceptional importance, both because of the number of claimants and the importance to them of obtaining such compensation as they may prove to be entitled to”. The court added “that on any view the situation facing the court was a difficult and novel one” and it “would benefit from full and thorough consideration by this court”. BHP has maintained that the proceedings do not belong in the UK. Knowles’s family have received no compensation in Brazil, where Samarco, BHP and Vale established the Renova Foundation to mitigate the environmental consequences of the collapse and to provide compensation for individuals and some small businesses for loss and damages. It is intended to provide full redress but has been criticised over its constitution, speed and fairness, the court of appeal heard. The court also noted deficiencies in the Brazilian justice system. BHP told the Guardian that, by November 2021, Renova had spent more than 19.6bn Brazilian reals (£2.6bn) on environmental and economic reparations and rehabilitation projects, including R$7.78bn in compensation and financial aid to 359,000 people. They introduced a new simplified indemnity system in August. The Knowles family home is still standing but they have been unable to sell it. “What happened can’t be repaired or put back, so it comes back down to survival. My family and I no longer have a place of our own to live; we lost the most fundamental thing – a roof over our heads. “To see this case through and be awarded enough money for a deposit, to start again, properly, that’s all we dare hope for.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,‘It’s about survival’: the Yorkshireman seeking justice for Brazil dam collapse,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/11/jonathan-knowles-justice-for-fundao-tailings-brazil-dam-collapse-aoe
3/11/2022,"Young lovers come and go but the Queen remains, adored by millions, immutable in her pomp and circumstance. In the early days of her reign, she appeared to be little more than a wig-maker’s fancy, a bejewelled figurehead with a disdainful sneer. But at some point over the course of the first season of the Netflix costume drama Bridgerton, the remote character of Queen Charlotte stepped down from her pedestal to become a cult figure in her own right. Not only is she very much in the foreground of the second series, presiding over her menageries of exotic animals and aristos, but she is shortly to have her very own spin-off series, delving into her background. Meanwhile, in a hard-to-find warehouse in west London, she presides over the Bridgerton Ball – an immersive fanfest hosted by Secret Cinema, where devotees in full fancy dress queue up to see her. So it’s quite a moment when the Queen, AKA actor Golda Rosheuvel, arrives at the Guardian offices with an advance guard of hat boxes and stylists. She is starting with a photoshoot, and when I pop my head in to ask if she would like anything to drink, she commands “water” in an imperious voice without moving her head or condescending to shift her eyes away from the camera. When Rosheuvel emerges, out of costume, to be interviewed, she is warm and animated, and falls on the water like a woman who has been standing for hours with a sheep on her head. In a way, that’s exactly what it is like every time she does anything Bridgerton-related. The Queen’s wigs – towering constructions of spun wool and jewels, of which I counted four in the first episode of the new series alone – set the tone of a period mashup in which Regency debutantes dance the quadrille to Madonna’s Material Girl. “The relationship with the wigs is really important,” Rosheuvel says. “In the first season, they were quite heavy. They were works of art, weren’t they? In the second season, we’ve got a different team on board. And, joyfully, I’m more collaborative with this team. So there are lots of fittings, lots of discussions, lots of creating the look actually on my head in the room. I’m definitely in a relationship with the wigs.” But Queen Charlotte is also more than her wigs; she is the doyenne of the marriage market, the fixer who decides which young woman will bag the most eligible duke or viscount by declaring them the season’s “diamond”. Last season’s diamond, Daphne (Phoebe Dynevor), is now a happily married mother, albeit with an absentee husband, after the swoon-worthy Regé-Jean Page quit the series. So it falls to Daphne’s judgmental older brother (Jonathan Bailey) to pick up the romantic lead with a couple of sisters recently returned from India – the ingenue Edwina Sharma (Charithra Chandran), who is quickly identified as the new diamond, and her dashing but prickly older sister Kate (Simone Ashley). Rosheuvel’s eyes widen in surprise when I suggest her character might be in danger of stealing the show, the first series of which is estimated to have been viewed by 82 million households. While the younger characters smile and simper, Charlotte is the queen of the meme-friendly pout and putdown: a best-moments compilation is entitled “Queen Charlotte being in a mood for four and a half minutes straight”. But she is also relatable: she loves a gossip, and is excitedly scandalised when mystery pamphleteer Lady Whistledown starts spilling all the secrets of the “ton” (the regency term for high society). Rosheuvel originally auditioned for the role of the Queen’s confidante, Lady Danbury. When that went to Adjoa Andoh, she was asked if she would consider reapplying. It was just before Christmas and she was about to set off for a holiday in France. “I only really had an afternoon to do it in. But I said to my agent: I’ll have a go.” With the help of her partner, the playwright Shireen Mula, she whacked a couple of scenes on to a demo tape, then forgot about it. A few days later, her agent rang and said the director had liked the tape and had sent it on to the producer, Shonda Rhimes. “There was a part of me that didn’t quite believe it, because I never think that anybody’s going to like what I do. But also part of me was jaw-droppingly excited,” Rosheuvel says. She knew of Rhimes’s production company, Shondaland, through the box set of its previous production Scandal, which became her guide and inspiration as she prepared for the biggest stage challenge of her career: playing a lesbian Othello at Liverpool’s Everyman theatre in 2018. Scandal featured Kerry Washington as Olivia Pope, a White House communications chief turned political fixer. “She was kind of my Othello: a strong Black actress playing a powerful character in this powerful world,” Rosheuvel says. Bridgerton is based on a series of romantic novels published by the American author Julia Quinn from 2000, which were reframed by Rhimes and showrunner Chris Van Dusen in a Regency society predicated on the real-life speculation that Queen Charlotte – the German-born wife of King George III – was of mixed heritage. “There was this idea of ‘what if?’,” says Rosheuvel. “What if Queen Charlotte is a person of colour? What does that do to the world that we are trying to create? Chris Van Dusen calls it conscious casting, not colourblind casting, because we are consciously creating this world. And, in doing it, the representation that we see in our own world is reflected back at us. It enables us to celebrate the kings and queens of this industry, who are people of colour, through the characters that we create in this fictitious world.” Rosheuvel herself is the older of two children born to a Guyanese father – a Church of England priest – and an English mother, who was a social worker specialising in dementia. Both were deeply musical: they met through a choir, and continued to combine work and music, in choirs and orchestras, after emigrating from Guyana to England when both their children were under five. Her younger brother went on to shine as a chorister at King’s College, Cambridge, and is now a music producer. But Rosheuvel struggled academically at school, and couldn’t settle to an instrument. “I’m dyslexic, so I find reading and writing very difficult. I discovered that my instrument was my voice,” she says. She starred in Bugsy Malone, but she also shone on the sports field, where she competed as a decathlete. “And I was bloody good,” she says. “I broke a few school records, a few county records as well.” When her sporting ambitions were derailed by a bad ankle sprain, she changed tack and enrolled at 16 for a drama diploma. Her name may sound unfamiliar, but if you’ve watched any soaps over the last two decades you will have seen her in police stations or hospital wards: she saw Sally Webster through cancer on Coronation Street, delivered Linda Carter’s baby on East, Enders,and treated Doctor Who’s companion Martha Jones when she was attacked by the resurrection gauntlet in Torchwood. She was on stage in a minor role, in the West End hit The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, when the ceiling collapsed in 2013. But then, she says, “I took myself out of work, and made myself unemployed, because I was frustrated about the parts that I was getting: you do them for a while when you’re getting established, but they were stereotypical Black parts, and I got to a point where I wanted more. I really had to sit down and work out where the frustration was coming from and what I could do about it,” she says. The lightbulb moment came with the realisation that it wasn’t the parts themselves that were the problem. “The parts were great. I didn’t mind playing the nurse, the policewoman, the mum with a wayward child. But I wanted them to be part of the storyline, not just a side note.” For the best part of a year she turned down all offers. It was 2012, the year when the Olympics came to London. “I was sitting on my couch thinking: ‘How ironic is this? This is what I was training for. I’m watching what could have been.’ It was bizarre. I took a risk, but it worked.” Gradually, better offers began to roll in, often with a revisionist twist. She played Mercutio as a female clown at the Globe, and a season of plays at the Liverpool Everyman that not only included her mould-breaking Othello, but roles in the musical Paint Your Wagon and a reimagining of Peer Gynt, The Big I Am. Then came “a really great, chunky role” in Silent Witness, as well as the Old Vic’s hit A Christmas Carol, where she played the Ghost of Christmas Present, and most recently, the epic fantasy film Dune, in which she was housekeeper Shadout Mapes. She lives in south London with Mula, whom she met “the old-fashioned way – at a mate’s party”. They’ve been together nine years and are touchingly devoted. “Lover you are my world. You came to bring me home. You cleaned you packed you sorted it all out when I was doing 2 shows,” she tweeted, at the end of her Liverpool run. An audience with a member of the Bridgerton cast would not be complete without a delicious piece of society gossip, and Rosheuvel duly delivers, revealing that the Queen’s consort is one of the writers on the Bridgerton Ball. “I don’t think Secret Cinema actually knows that I’m Shireen’s partner. We’ve never said anything, which is fun,” she confides. Eat your heart out, Lady Whistledown.
