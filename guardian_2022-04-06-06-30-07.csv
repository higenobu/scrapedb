4/6/2022,"Frank Lampard has criticised a Premier League fixture schedule that he claims complicates Everton’s survival prospects with an early kick‑off against Manchester United on Saturday. Everton visit Burnley on Wednesday in a game of huge significance to each team’s prospects of avoiding relegation. They then host United at 12.30pm on Saturday, at the request of broadcasters, and Lampard believes the arrangement is both unnecessary and an unfair burden on his team at a critical stage of the season. The Everton manager, whose team have not won away in the Premier League since August, said: “We have been asked to play three games from Sunday to Wednesday to Saturday morning. It is an incredible schedule really. We have the short straw this week. “It is definitely a disadvantage. Whether it plays out on the pitch we have to contest against that, but I think the turnaround, especially to Manchester United on Saturday lunchtime after playing Burnley on the Wednesday night, will be a tough one. We will do everything we can to recover. We are fortunate we have a great staff, a great medical team, and a squad to choose from. “I know I am mentioning it and I think it is right to. It could have been different. For the brand of the Premier League, who want the best football, to put the game on Wednesday evening and one on Saturday morning when the stakes are so high, there is no need for it. We don’t play again after Manchester United until the following Wednesday so there was plenty of scope for this one to look different and it doesn’t so that is frustrating. We just have to counteract it with everything we can.” Lampard’s problems exceed Everton’s schedule. Michael Keane and Allan are both suspended for Wednesday’s game, with the former Burnley defender’s ban leaving the visitors light at centre-half against Sean Dyche’s powerful side, while Donny van de Beek is sidelined by a thigh injury. Nathan Patterson is likely to be out for the rest of the season having damaged an ankle in training prior to what was scheduled to be his Premier League debut at West Ham. The Scotland international, who could miss his country’s World Cup play-off semi-final against Ukraine depending on when that is rearranged, will undergo surgery later this week. “Yes, possibly,” said Lampard, when asked whether the January signing’s season was over. “The diagnosis we have is that it’s looking like an eight to 10-week injury. “He was due to make his debut [on Sunday], he knew that, he has waited his time and performed well for Scotland, and that is the big disappointment. He is frustrated but it’s easier when you’re the older man and can tell him that he’s young and has so much time ahead of him. The timing of this will mean he’ll have the summer to really get over it and to be fighting fit for the start of next season. It is unfortunate for him but we just have to accept it. Nathan will get all the right support in the short term and he’ll be back.”",Sport/Football,Frank Lampard says schedule could harm Everton’s survival prospects,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/05/frank-lampard-says-schedule-could-harm-evertons-survival-prospects
4/6/2022,"Attacks against the press in Mexico have increased by 85% since President Andrés Manuel López Obrador took office, making it the most deadly period for journalists since records began, according to a new report. Mexico is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists with 1,945 attacks – including 33 murders – between 2019 and 2021, according to the press freedom group Article 19. Another eight have been killed so far this year. In 2021, there were 664 documented attacks – the equivalent of one every 14 hours – including online threats, harassment, arbitrary criminal charges and seven murders. Government officials were linked to 274 of the incidents, while organised crime accounted for about 42. Violence against journalists has been mounting over the past two decades, but has soared under López Obrador, who frequently attacks journalists and independent news outlets during his morning briefings. The populist president has repeatedly downplayed violence against the press, and recently lashed out at the European parliament after its members urged him to rein in the media-bashing rhetoric. But Article 19’s new report underscores the growing threat media workers across the country have been suffering and warns that “denying this reality results in no urgent measures being taken to stop this brutal spiral of violence”. Journalists in Mexico face a myriad of threats. Reporters who cover corruption and politics continue to face the highest risks, followed by breaking news reporters covering shootings, accidents and other disasters. Journalists who cover migration were also targeted with 20 documented attacks, which were often linked to immigrations officials and the national guard. The murder of Regina Martínez in 2012 began a wave of violence in the state of Veracruz, and exposed the risks faced by local reporters brave enough to investigate the links between politics and organised crime. “The impact of the murders of journalists is brutal, it affects their families and the profession as a whole,” said Patricia Mayorga, a reporter at the news weekly Proceso. “Society needs to be convinced that without public service journalism, we would not know what is happening in the rest of the country.” Last year, a global coalition of news organisations reported on widespread illegal hacking under the previous administration, which used the Israeli spyware Pegasus against human rights activists, teachers, academics and journalists. The investigation found that the telephone of Cecilio Pineda, a local crime and politics reporter in the state of Guerrero, was marked for targeting a few weeks before he was murdered in 2017. Nineteen journalists were murdered during Enrique Peña Nieto’s government between 2013 and 2018, and 26 under Felipe Calderón between 2007 and 2012. But López Obrador is the first to vilify journalists so consistently. In 2021, the president and his officials maligned the press at least 71 times, and the same insults were often repeated by private and public figures the same day, according to the report. “Violence against the press in Mexico is an ongoing tragedy. Democracies have promised journalists guarantees to do their work … without journalism there is no democracy and vice versa,” said Pedro Vaco, special rapporteur for freedom of expression at the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights.",News/Media,Attacks on press in Mexico escalated during López Obrador’s presidency,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/05/attacks-press-mexico-lopez-obrador-presidency-report
4/6/2022,"Andy Robertson glared at the Benfica fans who pelted him with flag poles as he waited to take a stoppage time corner, but Liverpool had already served out punishment. Jürgen Klopp’s side are firmly on course for the Champions League semi-finals following a commanding win in Lisbon. There were unforeseen nerves when Darwin Nunez handed Benfica a lifeline early in the second half but Luis Díaz’s late finish, on top of first half goals from Ibrahima Konaté and Sadio Mané, reflected the visitors superiority on the night. Liverpool were a model of composure from the first whistle, with neither the raucous atmosphere inside Estádio da Luz nor six changes from the team that beat Watford in the Premier League on Saturday able to disturb their rhythm. Such is the strength at Klopp’s disposal as they enter a defining phase of the campaign. His team had to deal with moments of individual menace from Benfica’s forwards but otherwise they were in almost complete control throughout the first half; quicker and stronger in the challenge, better structured and the more cohesive attacking unit. But for a few lapses in front of goal and interventions by Benfica goalkeeper Odisseas Vlachodimos, the quadruple chasers would have had the entire tie sewn up by half-time. They had to settle for a two-goal cushion instead. Benfica found threats coming from all angles. Former Porto winger Díaz, his every touch whistled by his old rivals, was a potent outlet on his return to Portugal and involved in two early openings. His left wing run ended in Robertson crossing for Mané to head over before, after Gilberto had over-elaborated and lost possession, Díaz delivered a delightful low cross into the penalty area that both Mané and Mohamed Salah missed. Salah’s anguished reaction confirmed he should have done better with an inviting ball that rolled under his foot. Klopp had hinted in his pre-match press conference that Liverpool’s leading goalscorer will need to be rested at some point following a demanding season for club and country. But not yet. There was no sign of fatigue in Salah when he found Mané and sprinted on to an exquisite back-heel through the home defence from the Senegal international. Salah shot before Nicolas Otamendi could intervene only for Vlachodimos to save at his near post. The Egypt international then broke down the right from a Trent Alexander-Arnold pass and teed up Naby Keïta on the edge of the Benfica area. Vlachodimos kept his team level once again. But not for long. There was an inevitability about the 350th away goal of Klopp’s Liverpool reign, although not about the identity of the goalscorer. When Robertson swung a corner over from the left Konaté was given far too much space inside the area and powered an unstoppable header into the bottom corner. Former Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen missed the initial header, while the diminutive Everton was left to mark the towering Konaté for some reason. The £36m summer signing from RB Leipzig cared little as he celebrated the first goal of his Liverpool career. Keïta could have made it two moments later when Mané, having worked his way free on the left, found the unmarked midfielder inside the box. His header lacked power or accuracy to trouble the Benfica keeper. Díaz then found himself through on goal courtesy of a fine ball from Keïta. Vlachodimos stood tall and blocked Díaz’s attempted chip with his chest. Liverpool were dominant, a second goal seemingly as inevitable as the first, but survived a scare when Everton’s corner offered Otamendi a clear chance to equalise with a close range header. The former Manchester City defender failed to connect, however, and was made to pay within seconds as the precise right foot of Alexander-Arnold carved open the Benfica defence once again. The right-back, back in the side following a recent hamstring injury, swept a beautiful ball between Gilberto and Otamendi and into the path of the in-rushing Díaz. The Colombia international showed good awareness to head across goal to Mané, who made no mistake with a simple finish at the end of a superb move. Another brilliant Alexander-Arnold pass gave Salah sight of goal on the stroke of half-time. Played in behind the Benfica left-back, Alejandro Grimaldo, Salah was clean through and had time to pick his spot to Vlachodimos’s left, but the keeper saved well to prevent the forward scoring for the ninth European away game in succession. A 3-0 goal interval lead would not have flattered Liverpool, such was their superiority, yet their procession unexpectedly ran aground immediately after the restart as Benfica re-emerged with far greater intensity and belief. Caretaker coach Nelson Verissimo must have been in superb form during the break. Suddenly Nunez was wreaking havoc at a centre-forward, albeit aided and abetted by a bad mistake from Konaté, and it was Liverpool’s turn to flounder. The hosts were given renewed purpose when Rafa Silva broke down the right and centred low into the visitors’ penalty area. Konaté had the ball covered only to completely miss his clearance, and turned around in horror to see the cross land at the feet of Nunez The Benfica striker found the far corner of Alisson’s goal with ease. Nunez then shot over from distance and headed over another cross from Silva as Benfica pressed for a swift equaliser. Everton forced Alisson to parry from distance and, as the pressure intensified, Klopp responded with a triple substitution. The introduction of Jordan Henderson, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino helped restore order, although not before Nunez had a penalty appeal waved away when he raced clear down the left and checked inside Virgil van Dijk. The Liverpool defender stuck out an arm to halt the striker’s run but the Spanish referee and VAR were unmoved by Nunez’s impassioned appeals for a spot-kick. Benfica’s threat dissipated thereafter, and Díaz restored Liverpool’s comfortable advantage with three minutes remaining. Keïta sent the January signing clear of the Benfica defence with a threaded pass that took a slight touch off Otamendi. Díaz did the rest, rounding the advancing Vlachodimos before finishing expertly. The semi-finals surely await.",Sport/Football,Luis Díaz returns to Portugal to haunt Benfica and seal Liverpool’s first-leg win,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/05/benfica-liverpool-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report
4/6/2022,"When I was in my 20s I went out for quite a while with a man who had a disability that affected his ability to walk, and who had a son severely disabled by cerebral palsy – he communicated non-verbally and would never be able to live independently. To go out with them was to have your eyes opened to just how much of disability is socially constructed. Which is the fancy way of saying that there wouldn’t be half so many problems for loads of disabled people if shops would just bother putting ramps and lifts in, and if non-disabled people would stop staring in either disgust or fascination at anyone who deviates even slightly from the physical norm. And a special shout-out, even 20-odd years on, to the lady who advised us from a position of unassailable entitlement and fury to “Stop breeding”. On the other hand, we – as a group, and my boyfriend and his son as individuals – were, for the bulk of the time, met with great kindness, generosity and practical help from the non-staring demographic. But it is inescapably the case that to live with any condition that marks you out from the herd is to live, to some degree, in a different world from most. Ellie Simmonds: A World Without Dwarfism (BBC One) is presented by the multiple gold medal-winning Paralympian swimmer, who has achondroplasia – a rare genetic condition which causes a type of dwarfism. The programme poses the question of how much we should expect (or wait for) society to change and how much, if medical science offers the chance, people with disabilities (or states classed as such in the public mind) should change themselves. Vosoritide is a new drug, designed to mitigate the symptoms of achondroplasia. There are other drugs too, aimed at other forms of dwarfism, but vosoritide is in the final stages of its clinical trials and may be available on the NHS from 2023. If given as a daily injection to growing children it can give them straighter spines and legs (bowing is a common feature of achondroplasic dwarfism), help avoid various surgeries that are commonly needed, lessen pains that are commonly experienced by stressed joints and – this seems to be where most of the focus is, for parents, patients, doctors and campaigners both for and against its introduction – make them taller. So what do you do? Is this, as the doctor leading the UK trials seems to believe, a wholly unproblematic field of endeavour for medicine, seeking to eradicate the genuine physical problems associated with dwarfism, but not dwarfism itself? Or is it, as put by an activist in the US – where the drug is already approved – an existential threat to dwarfism (and by extension, all other forms of difference)? Is it giving in to prejudice, or empowering individuals to live their best lives in an enduringly imperfect world? Simmonds starts from a pretty much wholly anti-drug perspective but, as she gathers accounts from parents of children on the drug, the children themselves and people who have undergone other procedures, she is open and honest about how fortunate she has been in her upbringing and how much this has coloured her thinking. She was born to average-sized parents who immediately accepted her condition and ensured she was from the beginning in contact with those who shared it. Her sporting talent was discovered at a very young age and enabled her to grow up with the message, overwhelming any outside negativity, that her body was something special and could – as indeed it did – lead her to greatness. It is perhaps not until she interviews her teammate Will Perry, who also has achondroplasia, that she realises her life experience is not representative even within the narrow confines of Paralympian-hood. Perry speaks with passion and great articulacy on the rage and misery of the prejudice he has encountered – he is “50/50”, he says, on whether he would swap his life for a “normal” one – and is much less sure than Simmonds that he would not put his putative children on the drug. Simmonds is not a natural interviewer (she is particularly reluctant to push vosoritude-embracing parents on the wider implications of their decisions and she doesn’t take on any of the people at a Silicon Valley convention for research into dwarfism – “All raising funds to cure me”) but this frank discussion between friends left you wanting more of it. There was little examination of other cultural issues that can be at play – no consideration of how Perry’s experience and outlook differ because he is a man and men are not “supposed” to be short, for example – or comparisons with the effect medical interventions have had on other conditions (amniocentesis tests and Down’s syndrome birthrates, perhaps). But it raised questions and awareness – and hopefully there are more of both to come.",Arts/Television & radio,Ellie Simmonds: A World Without Dwarfism review – are drugs really the answer?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/05/ellie-simmonds-a-world-without-dwarfism-review-are-drugs-really-the-answer
4/6/2022,"Ministers are refusing to disclose any pictures taken by official No 10 photographers of illegal gatherings held inside Downing Street, prompting Labour to call on Boris Johnson to “come clean and release these photos”. The Cabinet Office refused to confirm or deny the existence of any photographs of events in the cabinet room, leaving parties, and a party in the prime minister’s Downing Street flat, after official pictures of the gatherings were requested under freedom of information laws. It said disclosing such information could prejudice the investigation, and contravene the principle of “fairness” under data protection regulations. It has been reported that photographs taken by taxpayer-funded official photographers for No 10 are among the evidence handed to Sue Gray for her investigation into the parties, including one of Johnson’s birthday gathering on 19 June 2020, where he is allegedly holding up a beer towards the camera in a toast. The refusal prompted Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, to demand the release of the photographs. “The Downing Street photographer is funded by the taxpayer. The public have every right to see the photos that their hard-earned money has paid for,” she said. “By blocking their publication, Boris Johnson is trying to cover up his own rule breaking. “As this government inflicts crippling tax hikes on working families during a cost of living crisis, the least they can do is be honest about what that money is being spent on. Boris Johnson must come clean and release these photos.” It comes as the government is under fire over its lack of transparency over who has been issued with fines over the Partygate scandal. The government is not requiring civil servants to disclose to the Cabinet Office if they receive penalties after a police investigation. Only Boris Johnson and Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, have committed to revealing whether they are hit by fines. Jill Rutter, a senior fellow at the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank, wrote on Tuesday that Partygate “should not degenerate into a Whitehall version of Cluedo … the Met should stop dribbling out fines; there should be a commitment to name the most senior civil servants and all ministers fined”. Helen MacNamara, the former head of propriety and ethics in the Cabinet Office, issued an apology after a leak named her as one of the 20 people issued with fines as part of the Met investigation. A leaving party for Kate Josephs, who ran the Covid taskforce, has also attracted fines in the first wave of penalty notices. Josephs is now on paid leave from her job as chief executive of Sheffield city council pending an investigation and it is not known whether she has personally received a fine. Gray has the power to name senior civil servants in her report although she may choose not to use it. In her interim report, she named no names and referred only to the “senior official whose principal function is the direct support of the prime minister” – thought to be an allusion to Martin Reynolds, the principal private secretary.",News/Politics,Partygate: ministers refuse to disclose pictures taken by No 10 photographers,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/05/partygate-ministers-refuse-to-disclose-pictures-taken-by-no-10-photographers
