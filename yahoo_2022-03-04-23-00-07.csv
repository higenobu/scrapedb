3/4/2022,"President Joe Biden had a crystal clear message for Russian oligarchs: We're coming for your assets. ""The United States Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of the Russian oligarchs. We're joining with European allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets. We're coming for your ill-begotten gains,"" Biden said Wednesday during the State of the Union. Just hours after that speech, French authorities announced they had seized a yacht linked to Russian oligarch Igor Sechin. But it isn't just Russian oligarchs who are on edge. Wealthy non-oligarch Russians are also fretting asset seizure. In the decades since the Soviet Union collapsed, rich Russians have poured gobs of money into American real estate. Now, they're worried they could get caught in the crossfire as the U.S. goes after Vladimir Putin's allies. Dolly Lenz, one of the most sought-after luxury real estate brokers in America, tells Fortune she's getting inundated with inquiries from Russian clients who are considering selling their U.S. real estate holdings. Those luxury units—with a lot worth over $10 million—are in some of Miami and New York City's most exclusive neighborhoods, including Billionaires' Row in Manhattan. ""The heat is up. They're scared that they're going to have their real estate seized or potentially seized. Or linked to someone who is seized. They're scared to death of [guilt] by association,"" Lenz says. While she has yet to see a flood of Russian-owned luxury real estate hit the market, she says it's on the horizon. ""There are already more inquiries, and that's how it starts. That's how we know [a flood of listings by Russians] is coming."" Not only are more ultra-wealthy Russians looking to sell their properties, Lenz says, many want to cancel upcoming real estate projects and business deals. Even if it means losing their deposit. ""We know of several deals where [Russian] buyers had put down money on new development—with significant deposits. And are deciding to not go through with the deal. That's pretty bad... They told us they will walk away from the deposit if the climate stays this way,"" Lenz says. In some cases, she says, they'd lose a deposit upwards of $15 million if they go through with exiting the real estate development deals. Lenz also has Russian clients who are interested in offloading property they own on Fisher Island. Located just off the shore of Miami, the luxury condominium-dotted island has become an absolute hotbed for Russian billionaires and oligarchs. In 2017, a Russian buyer snagged the largest penthouse at Fisher Island’s Palazzo del Sol—a luxury condominium where Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov used to have a residence—for $31 million. Just last month, Russian hockey star Ilya Kovalchuk bought a $8.5 million condo at Fisher Island's Palazzo Della Luna. Those two buildings along with the island's Palazzo Del Mare—where Russian businessman Igor Olegovich Nesterenk sold his 5 bedroom unit last month for $21 million—in particular, are known for being sought-after by wealthy Russians. But not everyone Fortune spoke with is seeing an influx of Russian luxury sellers. Stuart Siegel, global head of private office at Engel & Völkers Americas, says it's too early to tell if the Ukraine invasion will correspond with a wave of Russians selling their U.S. real estate holdings. He says economic and political instability in Russia could even encourage some Russians—at least those who aren't on federal watch lists—to cling to their American real estate holdings. ""In times of global turmoil, American real estate has always been viewed as a safe harbor,"" Siegel says.

3/4/2022,"Tucker Carlson changed his tone on Tucker Carlson Tonight Thursday regarding Russia’s unprompted invasion of Ukraine. In the weeks leading up to the invasion, Carlson repeatedly supported Russia, and defended Russian President Vladimir Putin. Carslon had said that the United States should side with Russia, and even said he was rooting for them in the conflict. Carlson was apparently surprised by the Russian aggression that began over a week ago. “This situation appears to become more chaotic by the day, possibly even spinning out of control and that, we must be honest, is shocking to us,” Carlson said. “We've been taken by surprise by the whole thing. We’re not the only ones who were, but we’re willing to admit it. The only thing more embarrassing than being wrong in your estimates is pretending that you weren’t.” Carlson declined to admit he was wrong in the days since Russia began targeting Ukrainian civilians, and may have been prompted to do so because on Thursday Russian forces began to attack a Ukrainian nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. But rather than take responsibility for his misguided praise of Putin and Russia, Carlson found a scapegoat: The Biden administration. “If the future of Europe and the world hung in the balance, as now so obviously it does, of course, the Biden administration would not have sent Kamala Harris to fix it,” Carlson said, later adding, “That is absolutely not Kamala Harris’s job. That was our assumption. But, as noted, we were wrong.” TUCKER CARLSON: We've been taken by surprise by the whole thing. We're not the only ones who were, but we're willing to admit it. The only thing more embarrassing than being wrong in your estimates is pretending that you weren't. - On ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" Thursday, Carlson finally admitted that he was wrong about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This comes after weeks of the popular Fox News opinion host supporting Russia and defending Russian President Vladimir Putin. TUCKER CARLSON: Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him? I think we should finally take the side of Russia if we have to choose between Russia and Ukraine. That is my view. - But-- TUCKER CARLSON: --Ukraine and Russia. And I'm serious. - I'll tell you why. TUCKER CARLSON: And why shouldn't I root for Russia, which I am? - Carlson declined to admit he was wrong, despite days of the Russian military targeting Ukrainian civilians. He only made the admission after Russia began attacking a nuclear power plant, the largest in all of Europe. But Carlson had a scapegoat. TUCKER CARLSON: Why didn't we see this coming, this total loss of control? Well, because we assumed that if things were dire, serious people would be involved in fixing them. But we looked up and we saw Kamala Harris involved, and that reassured us. - Carlson went on to blame the Biden administration rather than taking responsibility for his misguided defense of Putin and Russia. TUCKER CARLSON: If the future of Europe and the world hung in the balance, as now so obviously it does, of course the Biden administration would not have sent Kamala Harris to fix it.
