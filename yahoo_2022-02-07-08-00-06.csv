2/7/2022,"An early-morning robbery attempt at an Oxnard convenience store ultimately left the suspect dead after the clerk fought back, authorities said. The scene unfolded shortly after 1:50 a.m. at the Circle K store at 490 S. Victoria Ave., located at the corner of West Fifth Street near the Oxnard Airport. The suspect, a 30-year-old Oxnard man, had gone into the store armed with what appeared to be a handgun, said Oxnard Police Department Cmdr. Luis McArthur. Later, officers found it was a replica BB gun that looked realistic, he said.

The age of the adult male clerk wasn't immediately available. After taking the money, the suspect allegedly forced the clerk out of the store at gunpoint and walked him away from the business, McArthur said. The clerk, who feared for his life, fought with the suspect, department officials reported Thursday evening. During the fight, the victim pulled out a knife he had been carrying and stabbed the suspect multiple times, disarming the suspect. The suspect fled the scene. The clerk, whose age wasn't available, went back to the store and called 911. He was described by police as cooperative and forthcoming. At about 2 a.m., officers responded to reports of a stabbing victim in the 3500 block of Pier Walk in a neighborhood southeast of the convenience store. They eventually linked the stabbing victim to the attempted robbery. The suspect was taken by ambulance to Ventura County Medical Center in critical condition. He died of his wounds shortly before noon, officials said Thursday evening. His name was not immediately released pending notification of relatives. Detectives are continuing their active investigation. Anyone with information is asked to call Detective Michael Velasquez at 805-385-8287.
