4/21/2022,"Newcastle United’s startling metamorphosis under Eddie Howe continued as Miguel Almirón’s exquisite first half goal not only elevated them to the security of 40 points but secured a sixth successive home victory. That run equals a record set in 2004 here, back in the days when Tyneside’s were “walking in a Robson wonderland” during Sir Bobby Robson’s tenure. Eighteen years on Eddie Howe’s side remain a work in progress but, bolstered by Bruno Guimarães’s midfield excellence, are almost unrecognisable from the team Steve Bruce failed to coax a single win out of before being replaced by Howe in November. Newcastle’s cause was helped by meeting Crystal Palace on an evening when Patrick Vieira’s players were well below their best and performed as if they had not quite managed to shake last Sunday’s disappointment at Wembley from their systems. It is probably an understatement to say that Allan Saint-Maximin and Vieira did not always exactly see eye to eye when they were player and manager at Nice. While Vieira appreciated the winger’s natural talent he deplored his perceived lack of work ethic and, right from kick off, it appeared that this was one match Saint-Maximin particularly wanted to impress in. The two Frenchmen had no overt first half contact but, given that Saint-Maximin was deployed down Newcastle’s left, close to the technical areas, during that opening half there were plenty of moments when he shot surreptitious little glances at Palace’s manager. Evidently anxious to prove a point, Saint-Maximin was fairly heavily involved but, perhaps trying almost too hard, saw repeated dribbling manoeuvres fall apart at the vital moment. If he were still his coach, Vieira would doubtless have told him to keep his head up. Instead Palace’s coach was becoming increasingly preoccupied with the shortcomings of his current team. Before kick-off he had told his players he would “not tolerate a loss of concentration and hard work” in the wake of last weekend’s FA Cup semi final defeat to Chelsea. Unfortunately their repeated, rather slapdash, concessions of possessions as Newcastle dominated the opening 45 minutes, indicated that this message had fallen on deaf ears and few visiting fans could complain when Almirón gave Howe’s side a 32nd minute lead. Seconds after being embroiled in a mini scuffle with Wilfried Zaha, Almirón regained his composure sufficiently to receive a dropping through ball from Guimarães wide on the right. Having used his head to bring it under seamless, high skilled, control, the Paraguayan forward shrugged off his marker before advancing to send a sublime angled left foot shot swerving into the top corner, evading Vicente Guaita’s out-stretched fingertips on its subtly curving route. After spending the early part of Howe’s tenure on the sidelines, Almirón is making the very best of a very rare first team run facilitated by Ryan Fraser’s recent injury and both he and the, once again, influential Guimarães forced Guaita into decent saves before the interval. The second period began in similar vein. When Saint-Maximin slalomed beyond a series of defenders and remembered to look up he played in Guimarães who, in turn, cued up Almirón. On that occasion his shot was blocked but Vieira’s expression suggested that he would have relished throwing off his managerial anorak, jogging onto the pitch and turning back time by seizing control of central midfield, putting Guimarães in his place along the way. With Joelinton having failed to make the most of a glorious headed chance after connecting with Matt Targett’s free-kick, Palace’s manager decided change was imperative and duly made three substitutes by the hour mark. While Jordan Ayew had replaced Michael Olise in the 40th minute Jean-Philippe Mateta and James McArthur were introduced at the expense of Conor Gallagher and Cheikhou Kouyaté. Suitably galvanised Palace - and Zaha - finally woke up. If Howe looked somewhat relieved to see Zaha shoot wide after dodging three markers, he had reason to be grateful to Dan Burn in the wake of the centre-half’s fine interception to deny Mateta as he closed in on goal. With McArthur pleasing Vieira by finally making things tough for Newcastle’s midfield, Martin Dubravka needed to save the suddenly lively Odsonne Édouard’s header as Palace attempted to atone for the first half by finishing strongly. Almirón though had already ensured such efforts would prove too little too late.",Sport/Football,Almirón stunner sinks Crystal Palace and takes Newcastle to 40-point mark,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/newcastle-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report
4/21/2022,"By the end it was difficult to know which team’s future looks brighter. Chelsea had stumbled to their third successive defeat at Stamford Bridge and Arsenal, who seemed hell bent on throwing the points away at times, had secured a crucial win in the race for fourth. This was Mikel Arteta’s side in all their maddening glory. They were comical at the back during a wild first half, but they were inspired in attack. Two goals from Eddie Nketiah, his first in the league this season, were enough for them to go level on points with Tottenham in fourth place with six games left. Even more intriguingly, they are only five behind Chelsea and have seen that Thomas Tuchel’s side are wobbling. As ever there was no way of knowing which version of Arsenal would turn up. They are a team that lurches between extremes and the onus was on them to raise their level after Manchester United’s capitulation to Liverpool. The pressure was on after three consecutive defeats and the encouraging thing for Arteta was that Arsenal did not shy away from the challenge posed by Chelsea, who looked nervy after successive home defeats against Brentford and Real Madrid. The problem, however, was that the opening period summed up the contradictions in this Arsenal team. They were a joy to watch going forward, the interplay between Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe and Martin Ødegaard constantly giving Chelsea headaches, and yet twice they failed to hold on to the lead. Their back three was an accident waiting to happen at times and while Arteta was pleased with his side’s football, he must have been frustrated by their lack of conviction when they were in front. With the attendance capped due to the sanctions on Roman Abramovich, there had been a vulnerability to Chelsea. Malang Sarr, who started at left centre-back with Antonio Rüdiger unavailable, was shaky in possession. There was space for Saka to run at Sarr, who did not receive enough protection from Marcos Alonso, and that weakness in Chelsea’s defence would lead to Smith Rowe putting the visitors 2-1 up in the 27th minute. A lot had already happened. Arsenal, who wore black armbands in remembrance of their former chief scout Steve Rowley, who passed away at the age of 63, had started well. Arteta had matched Tuchel’s system by starting with a back three and Arsenal were soon in front. The goal summed up Chelsea’s difficulties without Thiago Silva and Rüdiger at the back. A long punt from Nuno Tavares had Andreas Christensen running towards his own goal and Eddie Nketiah hot on the centre-back’s heels. Christensen’s backpass was woefully underhit and Nketiah, who is considering a new contract offer from Arsenal, stole in to beat Edouard Mendy with a composed finish. Chelsea’s fans wondered whether Christensen is already thinking about his impending move to Barcelona, but the lead did not last long. Ruben Loftus-Cheek won possession high up the pitch and Timo Werner let fly with a shot that spun past Aaron Ramsdale thanks to a heavy deflection off Granit Xhaka. Chelsea were energised but they remained frail. Nketiah missed a decent chance after beautiful play from Saka, who was excelling at right wing-back, and the second goal soon arrived. Arsenal had just avoided another defensive calamity, Xhaka rescuing Rob Holding before beautifully bringing the ball forward. The ball came to Saka, then to Ødegaard. His pass set up Smith Rowe and the midfielder threaded a low shot past Mendy from 20 yards. Yet Chelsea refused to stop. After 32 minutes Mount hounded Ben White off the ball and crossed for César Azpilicueta, who escaped Tavares and prodded the ball home. Arsenal appealed for a foul on White; in truth the defender was not strong enough. But Arsenal continued to threaten. Tuchel was alarmed. He replaced Christensen with Silva at half-time but the change had no effect. After 57 minutes Azpilicueta misplaced a pass to Werner and Tavares attacked. The left wing-back found Nketiah and, when Silva, Sarr and N’Golo Kanté failed to clear, the striker prodded the ball past Mendy. Tuchel had seen enough. He removed Romelu Lukaku, who had done nothing but annoy the home crowd with his sluggishness on his first league start since 19 February, and put Kai Havertz up front as Chelsea chased another equaliser. It almost arrived when Ramsdale pushed out a cross from Reece James and Alonso saw a shot blocked. The pressure grew and Tuchel threw on Hakim Ziyech. But Arsenal, who host United on Saturday, held firm. They pushed on the break and the points were theirs when Azpilicueta conceded a penalty for fouling Saka. Saka nervelessly made it 4-2 from the spot and Chelsea, who finished with 10 men after Alonso limped off, had run out of ideas and their place in the top four is not certain yet.",Sport/Football,Eddie Nketiah double hands Arsenal vital win amid Chelsea chaos,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/chelsea-arsenal-premier-league-match-report
4/21/2022,"Chances were going begging, hope was fading and Burnley were looking at the possibility of dragging Everton into the relegation zone when Richarlison’s 92nd minute deflected equaliser rescued a vital point for Frank Lampard’s team against Leicester. Until the Brazilian’s late intervention it appeared Everton would follow up a morale-boosting win over Manchester United last time out with a damaging defeat to Harvey Barnes’ early goal. Everton have still not won back-to-back league games since September, the third and fourth matches of the season, and Burnley could yet overtake them before Sunday’s Merseyside derby with four points from their next two home games against Southampton and Wolves. But having stared at defeat for so long, Lampard will find consolation in his team’s refusal to accept it. Leicester played with a freedom and confidence that Everton’s predicament does not allow. An early lead helped, of course, along with the seven changes that Rodgers made from Sunday’s stoppage-time defeat at Newcastle. The Leicester manager replaced his entire back four and recalled James Maddison, Barnes and Kelechi Iheanacho. Lampard was forced into his attacking switch. Dominic Calvert-Lewin was ruled out of the game, plus Sunday’s Merseyside derby at Anfield, having felt “a small sensation in his quad in training,” according to the Everton manager. The squad has been plagued by recurring injuries this season and the trials of Calvert-Lewin, who was still searching for sharpness following a quadriceps problem that had sidelined him for four months, have been a major factor in Everton’s decline. The visitors immediately served notice of their ability to pierce Everton’s defence. Merely 25 seconds had elapsed when Ricardo Pereira’s threaded pass sent the impressive Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall clean through on goal. Séamus Coleman recovered with a vital challenge to spare his team from the worst possible start, injuring his thigh in the process, but the worst was only delayed. Leicester cut through again with ease from their next attack. Kasper Schmeichel picked out Pereira in space on the right with a precise clearance. The right-back exchanged passes with Youri Tielemans before releasing Maddison, who considered his options carefully on the right and centred for Iheanacho. The striker’s shot deflected off the lunging Yerry Mina, who was making his first start since 8 February, and fell to Barnes, who steered his first goal in 10 games through the legs of Coleman and in off the far post. Everton were passive in the face of Leicester’s comfortable passing game and too deep to apply serious pressure on the visiting defence. From their first meaningful attack, however, Lampard’s team should have equalised. Anthony Gordon escaped down the left and crossed hard and low across the Leicester six-yard box. Richarlison, unmarked at the back post, prodded badly wide with only Schmeichel to beat. Lampard had deployed the Brazil international down the middle in the absence of Calvert-Lewin, with Gordon to his right and the former Leicester winger Demarai Gray to the left. The trio struggled to make an impression against Leicester’s smart defence. Richarlison headed over from Alex Iwobi’s inviting cross while Gordon, having burst through on the right, over-hit his delivery with the Brazilian well-placed inside the area. Barnes, Dewsbury-Hall and Maddison regularly threatened to expose Everton on the counterattack. Judging by Rodgers’ undisguised frustration on the touchline, the Leicester manager was far from impressed by the end product. Everton awoke from their subdued start, as they had to. Gray was inches away from finding the top corner of Schmeichel’s goal from a well-worked corner by Gordon and Iwobi. There was greater intensity to the home performance after the interval too, although the lack of creativity prompted Lampard to introduce Dele Alli from the bench for the first time in over a month. With Richarlison isolated the Everton manager also introduced Salomón Rondón in an attempt to break down a resolute Leicester. The move almost paid dividends within seconds when Richarlison latched on to a towering header by the substitute and accelerated into the area, only for Schmeichel to palm away his powerful drive. Leicester remained a threat on the counterattack. Maddison went close three times to doubling the visitors’ advantage while Wesley Fofana headed a corner from the playmaker wastefully wide. Richarlison should have punished the let-off when Gordon’s corner found him in front of goal with seven minutes remaining. From six yards out, and with no Leicester player near him, the striker headed several yards wide. But he would make amends in stoppage time. Coleman had just missed another glorious chance to level when Alli broke down the right and crossed low towards Rondón. His fellow substitute turned the ball on to Richarlison who scuffed a shot off the despairing dive of Pereira and saw it trickle into the far corner.",Sport/Football,Richarlison denies Leicester to earn late relief for Everton in survival bid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/everton-leicester-premier-league-match-report
4/21/2022,"Good morning. The first leaders’ debate marked a turning point in this year’s election campaign, with the rivalry between the two major parties set to increase in the coming weeks. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese clashed over the NDIS, refugee boat turnbacks and China’s security agreement with Solomon Islands in the debate. The pair traded barbs over over the China-Solomon Islands deal, with Anthony Albanese labelling it a “Pacific stuff-up” and Scott Morrison accusing him of siding with China. During the debate, which the Labor leader won by swaying 40% of the audience over the prime minister’s 35%, Morrison focused on the handling of the economy while Albanese accused the government of “not pursuing any significant economic, social or environmental reforms”. In other election news, locals in the Sydney seat of Wentworth say the Coalition under Morrison is deeply unpopular and there’s only one hot topic up for discussion: “It’s all about bloody climate change,” one says. Australia’s coal export boom will come to an abrupt end because of an “imminent and substantial” drop in purchases by China, and coalmining communities should brace for the change, according to Jorrit Gosens, the lead author of a new study. Gosens said while both major party leaders were telling voters Australia’s coal exports had decades to run, the peer-reviewed paper forecast Chinese imports would fall in the next two the three years. “We do hope with this [study] that folks in coal mining regions, industries and governments also look at those results and figure out that they need to be a little bit more hasty with their plans to reduce their dependency on the coal mining industry,” he said. Vladimir Putin said Russia had successfully conducted a test launch of the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, a new addition to its nuclear arsenal. Putin said it would provide rivals with “food for thought”. Russia’s nuclear forces will start taking deliveries of the missile this year, once testing is complete. About 6,000 civilians trapped in Mariupol have been able to leave but officials said there were far fewer than hoped, as an ultimatum by Russia to Ukrainian fighters holding out in the city to surrender passed its deadline. The Australian War Memorial is pursuing a new sponsorship deal with the arms manufacturer Lockheed Martin despite criticism from veterans, historians and retired staff that the deal would be “degrading to the memory of our war dead”. Victoria and New South Wales will ease Covid restrictions for close contacts from Friday, a move that has been welcomed by business leaders, but split epidemiologists, some of whom are concerned it sends the wrong message at a time when daily infections remain high. The Australian Rail Track Corporation’s has proposed 200 drainage control areas over parts of the inland rail, after years of flood concerns raised by locals and experts. The aged care sector has questioned the Coalition’s claims that the home care workforce has grown 13% since November, saying the figures appear at odds with the “severe staffing challenges” it is experiencing. The Morrison government’s promise to spend $7.4bn on building a series of new dams is probably “the biggest pork barrel in history”, says the author of new research that claims other investment would deliver significantly better economic outcomes and more jobs. A UK court has formally approved the extradition of WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange to the US on espionage charges, in what will ultimately be a decision for the UK home secretary, Priti Patel. Downing Street has gone into open battle with the Church of England over its condemnation of the Rwanda deportation scheme, with No 10 officials doubling down on Boris Johnson’s claim that archbishops were being unfairly critical. Producers of the movie Rust have been handed the maximum fine for safety lapses before what authorities called the “avoidable” shooting death of the film’s cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins. The former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will kickstart his campaign to reclaim the presidency from his rightwing adversary Jair Bolsonaro. “Rightwing media no longer wield power as they once did. So why is Labor letting them set the election agenda?” asks Jeff Sparrow. “Each time News Corp turns its sights on a new target, Twitter campaigners blame an unprecedented ‘Murdochracy’ for the dire state of our political culture. Yet we need to remember that every significant social movement in Australian history has faced vocal – and sometimes overwhelming – opposition from the mainstream press.” Over three generations in India, members of the Jogi family have preserved their culture with unique and detailed ink works, which people can now see at the National Gallery of Victoria as part of a new exhibition highlighting acquisitions from contemporary Indian artists in rural, regional and Indigenous traditions. The art style was born when the family, who were traditionally roving musicians and singers of devotional songs and stories, were asked by the anthropologist Haku Shah to write down the songs to preserve the cultural tradition. The head of the family, Ganesh, could not write, so Shah suggested he draw the stories instead. Comedian Chris Parker falls asleep to TikToks each night – so who better to ask for the funniest videos online? “[The ‘Ahhh Girl’] arrived to TikTok this week and I simply love it.

What a community we’ve built!” In Tasmania, two marginal seats – Bass and Braddon – may swing again this election. While some voters in these seats feel ambivalent about the major parties, everyone knows the independent senator Jacqui Lambie and her party the Jacqui Lambie Network, whose preferences could shape the election result in the state.

4/21/2022,"Tesla surpassed Wall Street estimates for its first-quarter revenue and profit Wednesday, despite a tumultuous few months for its CEO, Elon Musk, and ongoing supply chain concerns. The electric car manufacturer reported $18.8bn in revenue for Q1 of 2022, up 81% from a year earlier. The report beat analyst expectations of $17.8bn, sending Tesla shares up 4% in after hours trading. Tesla said chip shortages and recent Covid-19 outbreaks had been weighing on its supply chain and factory operations, while prices of some raw materials had increased severalfold in recent months. “Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through the rest of 2022,” Tesla said in a statement. Tesla raised its prices in China, the US and other countries, after Musk said in March the carmaker was facing significant inflationary pressure in raw materials and logistics amid the crisis in Ukraine. Wednesday’s report came as Musk took the market on a rollercoaster by revealing this month that he had quietly become a major shareholder in Twitter and then offering to buy the company outright. There are concerns that Musk may sell some Tesla stocks or borrow against additional Tesla shares to finance his $43 bid to buy Twitter. The results also come amid several legal challenges for the founder and his company. On Wednesday, Musk requested a federal judge allow him to speak freely about a lawsuit accusing him of deceiving Tesla shareholders, which was settled this week. The settlement included a gag order that Musk and his attorneys called unconstitutional. Tesla is also facing multiple discrimination lawsuits. Investors will be watching to see Musk’s outside interests, including his bid for Twitter, affect the entrepreneur’s ability to successfully run Tesla, said Alyssa Altman, analyst at the consultancy firm Publicis Sapient. “It is critical that he continues to instill confidence that he has his hands on the wheel and is driving the complex business of Tesla in the right direction,” she said.
