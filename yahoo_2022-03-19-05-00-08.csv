3/19/2022,"When the omicron wave hit the United States, it spread throughout the country like wildfire. Different models estimate that anywhere from 50% to 75% of Americans had been infected with the variant by the end of the surge. MORE: Who is dying of COVID amid omicron surge and widespread vaccine availability? So, what does that mean for the rest of the U.S. population that did not contract COVID-19 during the last wave? Because omicron has shown the ability to cause breakthrough infections despite vaccination status, this has led to fears that everyone will catch the virus at some point. However, it is important to clarify that the COVID vaccines continue to be highly effective in its primary purpose in preventing hospitalization and death. However, public health experts said it's not inevitable Americans who have not gotten COVID yet eventually will, and that there are several reasons people have been able to avoid infection so far, including certain behaviors such as being serious about masking and social distancing, vaccination rates and maybe even genetics. Why some people haven't gotten COVID yet Doctors said there are several reasons millions of Americans have yet to contract the virus. One of those reasons is human behaviors, meaning people take proper precautions to lower their risk of getting infected. Dr. Alok Patel discusses the rise in COVID cases worldwide amid growing concerns that omicron subvariant B-A-2 is likely responsible for the increase. ""Sometimes people don't get infected because they're extremely cautious,"" Dr. Mark Siedner, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, told ABC News. ""There are people who have their own health behaviors or are concerned about their own health or their loved ones' health."" He continued, ""Maybe they have comorbidities … they may be the kind of people who are largely homebound, or not really interacting with others or are particularly careful with things like social distancing and masking, and that certainly can stop a lion's share of infections or certainly decrease the risk to where it's unlikely you'd be infected."" These people are also more likely to have been vaccinated and boosted, and the experts said it's impossible to disregard the effect vaccination rates have had on preventing infections among Americans. Dr. Jonathan Grein said there are also social and environmental reasons that could determine why some Americans have been infected and others haven't, including how much time people spend with others and where they interact. MORE: Rise in COVID-19 infections overseas may foreshadow increase in US, experts say ""Some people may come into more contact with people more regularly than others,"" Grein, director of hospital epidemiology at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, told ABC News. ""There's probably environmental reasons as well, the virus is probably transmitted more efficiently in certain circumstances like classically the indoor, poorly-ventilated space compared to outside."" However, genetics could also be playing a role. Dr. Stuart Ray, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University, said similar circumstances have been seen in people who were at high risk for HIV but did not contract the disease. ""One of the things that was discovered was people who had mutations in [a certain] receptor … and that was associated with not getting infected with HIV and in the uncommon people who do get infected, very slow progression to AIDS,"" he told ABC News. Although there has not yet been a clearly identified gene, Ray said it's feasible some people are genetically less susceptible to COVID. Is infection with COVID-19 inevitable? The experts said they don't believe that infection with COVID-19 is inevitable or at least inevitable for everyone. ""The fact that we're now two years in and a substantial number of people have not yet been infected is good evidence that it's not inevitable everyone will get it,"" Grein said. ""One thing we've clearly identified is that being vaccinated is the most important variable in deciding how protected somebody may be. However, Ray said he thinks Americans who are unvaccinated but haven't contracted the virus yet eventually will. ""As these variants have become more and more infectious, the likelihood that those people will get infected seems significant,"" he said. ""I do think it's likely that people who have not been vaccinated and not had COVID will eventually get it because we are not going to be tracking infections as closely as we have in the past and so there will be less awareness as the virus renters the community … and at some point their bubble will burst if they are not immune."" Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, said the COVID situation in Hong Kong is a ""horror story"" of what can happen in an unvaccinated country. Hong Kong currently has the world's highest COVID-19 death rate with a seven-day rolling average of 37.68 per million people, according to Our World in Data. MORE: New federal ventilation guidelines mark next step in fight against COVID ""Many people were vaccinated in Hong Kong, but it was the reverse of the U.S.,"" he said. ""In the U.S, so many seniors are vaccinated and boosted, but in Hong Kong, it was the opposite. Very few seniors were vaccinated so that when they did get it, even something 'milder' like omicron, many people were still dying, so that is a cautionary tale."" There is no number that determines when the U.S. has enough immunity Early in the pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci and other public health experts said the U.S. needed to vaccinate 75% to 85% to achieve herd immunity. Currently, only 65.3% of all Americans are fully vaccinated. Then, when U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last month he would be dropping the remaining COVID-19 restrictions in England, supporters said one of the reasons was because government figures showed more than 98% of the adult population in England has detectable COVID-19 antibodies either from previous infection or from vaccination. But officials said there is no number in the U.S. for which officials can declare there is ""enough immunity."" ""The game has been changed to some extent because the virus has been able to infect so many people and evolve,"" Ray said. ""It's level of infectivity right now is so high that the levels of antibodies required to prevent infection, the level we need to achieve is hard to sustain for a long period of time.""

3/19/2022,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Despite three weeks of Russian bombardment, Ukraine has kept up a stiff defense of its cities by using Turkish-made drones to carry out pop-up attacks on the invaders with a lethal effectiveness that has surprised Western military experts. The Bayraktar TB2 unmanned aerial vehicles, which carry lightweight, laser-guided bombs, normally excel in low-tech conflicts, and Turkey has sold them to more than a dozen countries, including Azerbaijan, Libya, Morocco and Ethiopia. The drones have carried out unexpectedly successful attacks in the early stages of Ukraine's conflict with Moscow, before the Russians were able to set up their air defenses in the battlefield, said Jack Watling of the London-based Royal United Services Institute. “The (TB2s) shouldn’t be making a meaningful impact because they are medium altitude, slow-flying aircraft with a large electromagnetic signature and a large radar cross-section. And the Russians have very capable air defense systems, so they should be being shot down. The terrain is very open and gives good radar coverage,” Watling added. He said Ukrainian forces ""have been essentially flying in at a low-level and then coming up and raiding with them. So striking targets of opportunity.” Over time, as the Russians get more organized and push out their air defenses, Watling said “the freedom to employ those drones is diminishing. And so what we are now seeing is that the Ukrainians are having to be careful as to when they commit them.” In a briefing to Parliament on March 9, British Defense Minister Ben Wallace praised the drones, along with other weapons donated to Ukraine by the West. “One of the ways they are delivering close air support or actual fire in depth is through the Turkish TB2 UAVs, which are delivering munitions onto their artillery and indeed their supply lines, which are incredibly important in order to slow down or block the Russian advance,” Wallace said. The drones also have scored success on social media. Their aerial video of the destruction of Russian armored vehicles has become a key tool for Ukraine's information war. Vasyl Bodnar, Ukraine’s ambassador to Turkey, shared videos of drone attacks on Twitter, including one that appeared to show a convoy of destroyed Russian military vehicles. “Masallah” or “Praise be” he wrote in a caption on one of the videos. A video using a song titled “Bayraktar” ‒ with sounds of explosions timed to coincide with the beats ‒ has been uploaded on YouTube and played on Ukrainian radio. “So as long as they still fly in, as long as they’re still armed, they will be useful. They will mostly be useful for the propaganda side,” said Aaron Stein, director of research at the U.S.-based Foreign Policy Research Institute. “The videos have enraptured people because you can see an airstrike in high definition.” Turkey began selling the TB2 drones to Ukraine in 2019, and Kyiv used them in fighting Russian-backed separatists in the eastern Donbas region — a move that Moscow called “destabilizing.” Turkish officials have refused to disclose details of the drone sales to Ukraine, including how many were involved and whether Kyiv is being resupplied. Independent estimates put the number of TB2s in Ukraine at between 20 and 50. “I think Turkey’s actually in the front, but not at the center, at least not publicly, of this conflict,” said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program and senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy in Washington D.C. “Its official policy regarding the war is what I would call ‘pro-Ukraine neutrality.’ It acts neutral. It wants the war to end, but it is militarily helping Ukraine. ... It has been selling these killer drones to Ukraine that are apparently doing an amazing job.” The drones ‒ priced under $2 million each according to estimates ‒ are produced by the Baykar defense company, which belongs to the family of Selcuk Bayraktar, the son-in-law of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Bayraktar is Baykar’s chief technical officer. The TB2 has been credited with helping tip the balance of conflicts in Libya, as well as to Turkey's ally Azerbaijan in fighting with Armenian-backed forces in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region in 2020. Ankara has also used the drones against Kurdish militants in Turkey and northern Iraq as well as against Kurdish fighters in Syria. Such less-expensive drones are likely to have a lasting impact on warfare as a useful tool of attrition, as well as being able to draw in the attention of more expensive enemy jets, Stein said. “I’d call it the Toyota Corolla of drones. ... It doesn’t do everything that your high-end sports car does, but it does 80% of that, right?” he said. “So even for a high-end military, like the U.S., the basic concept of using in an attritable, cheap platform to strike a superior force has inherent value.” An unspecified number of U.S.-made drones will be among the additional $800 million in military assistance to Ukraine announced Wednesday by President Joe Biden. It also includes 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, 100 grenade launchers, 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition, and grenade launchers and mortar rounds. The White House has been weighing giving Ukraine access to U.S.-made Switchblade drones that can fly and strike Russian targets, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. It was not immediately clear if the new drones that Biden said would be delivered to Ukraine include those or others. ___ Gatopoulos reported from Athens, Greece.

3/19/2022,"Weam Brieche often posts videos about eating raw meat as part of his fitness routine. One video went viral, where he appears to eat raw brain and eggs for a ""high protein"" breakfast. Experts say eating raw meat can increase risk of disease, so it is safer to have cooked protein. A fitness influencer called Weam Brieche filmed himself appearing to eat raw beef brain and eggs in a viral TikTok posted on March 14 that has been viewed over 10 million times. In the video, Brieche said he was going to show his viewers ""how to eat a high protein breakfast if you don't have time to cook,"" before taking a bite out of what he said was a ""raw beef brain,"" and washing it down with a glass of ""six raw eggs."" He directed viewers to a discount code on his Instagram page, saying they could use it buy some brain for themselves from a free-range meat shop based in New York. Commenters under the video were shocked by the way Brieche appeared to enjoy the unconventional meal. One comment with 10,000 likes said the raw eggs weren't ""a big deal"" but Brieche was ""foul for eating a brain like it's banana bread."" Insider previously reported that eating eggs raw instead of cooking them increases the risk of salmonella and is also less nutritious, as the process of cooking an egg makes the proteins in it easier to absorb. Some commenters also expressed concern about the safety of the raw meat, with one writing ""enjoy the prions."" Prion disease can be caused by eating contaminated raw meat and lead to memory impairment, personality changes, and difficulties with movement. Influencers and celebrities have previously drawn attention for diets consisting of raw animal organs, often expressing a belief that by not cooking the meat, the body absorbs more of its natural nutrients. However, experts say that people should avoid eating raw meat because it increases the risk of contracting foodborne diseases. Bonnie Taub-Dix, a registered dietitian, previously told Insider, ""When you eat raw meat you run the risk of developing food poisoning,"" adding that some raw meat may also contain parasites like roundworms or tapeworms. Common pathogens in raw meat and organs include E. coli, salmonella, Campylobacter, and listeria, Taub-Dix said. According to medical news website Healthline, animal brain is a rich source of omega-3 and fatty acids, which can improve cardiovascular health. However, the outlet recommends avoiding beef brain as it could lead to increased risk of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), also known as ""mad cow disease."" According to John Hopkins Medicine, a human who eats the contaminated brain can develop dementia, muscle stiffness, and speaking difficulties. The FDA states that brain meat from high-risk cattle is prohibited from entering the US food supply to reduce the risk of BSE, which affects 300 Americans per year. In the description of his YouTube channel, Brieche wrote that he is not a doctor and said ""none of my videos should be taken as medical advice,"" adding, ""raw meat consumption could be dangerous if not well sourced."" Brieche has 100,000 followers on TikTok, where he updates viewers on his fitness journey, often eating meals that contain raw meat. He also has a YouTube channel with 1,000 subscribers, where he said he relies on ""animal fat for energy"" during workouts. On TikTok, Brieche continues to post videos where he eats unconventional food, such as one TikTok with 20,000 views where he bit into a chunk of meat he described as ""raw testicles,"" before unwrapping a stick of butter and eating it. In a video with 800,000 views, he also showed viewers his freezer, which appeared to be filled with bags of raw meat, including ""steaks,"" ""bone marrow,"" and ""liver,"" he said. Weam Brieche did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. For more stories like this, check out coverage from Insider's Digital Culture team here.

3/19/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Key figures for a war half a world away, President Joe Biden and China’s Xi Jinping spoke for nearly two hours on Friday as the White House looked to deter Beijing from providing military or economic assistance for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. China’s Foreign Ministry, in a readout after the video conversation, deplored “conflict and confrontation” as “not in anyone’s interest,” but assigned no blame to Russia and gave no indication of next steps. The White House said Biden underscored to Xi the “implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against Ukrainian cities and civilians.” Ahead of the call, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden would question Xi about Beijing’s “rhetorical support” of Putin and an “absence of denunciation” of Russia’s invasion. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying pushed back, calling the U..S. administration’ “overbearing” for suggesting China risks falling on the wrong side of history. Planning for the leaders' discussion had been in the works since Biden and Xi held a virtual summit in November, but differences between Washington and Beijing over Russian President Vladimir Putin's prosecution of his three-week-old war against Ukraine were likely at the center of the conversation. China on Friday also sought to highlight its calls for negotiations and its donations of humanitarian aid, while accusing the U.S. of provoking Russia and fueling the conflict by shipping arms to Ukraine. Xi also renewed China’s criticism of sanctions imposed on Russia over the invasion, according to Chinese State Media. As in the past, Xi did not use the terms war or invasion to describe Russia’s actions. “As leaders of major countries, we need to consider properly resolving global hotspot issues and, more importantly, global stability and the production and life of billions of people,"" he was quoted as saying. In an attempt to show international support for China’s position, state broadcaster CCTV said Xi also discussed Ukraine in phone calls with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, contending the leaders’ views were “extremely close.” The U.S.-China relationship, long fraught, has only become more strained since the start of Biden's presidency. Biden has repeatedly criticized China for military provocations against Taiwan, human rights abuses against ethnic minorities and efforts to squelch pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong. But the relationship may have reached a new low with the Russian invasion. In the days after Putin deployed Russian forces in Ukraine, Xi’s government tried to distance itself from Russia’s offensive but avoided the criticism many other nations have leveled at Moscow. At other moments, Beijing’s actions have been provocative including amplifying unverified Russian claims that Ukraine ran chemical and biological weapons labs with U.S. support. Earlier this week, the U.S. informed Asian and European allies that American intelligence had determined that China had signaled to Russia that it would be willing to provide both military support for the campaign in Ukraine and financial backing to help stave off the impact of severe sanctions imposed by the West. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday reiterated that the Biden administration remains concerned that China is considering providing military equipment. He said Biden would make clear to Xi “that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia’s aggression, and we will not hesitate to impose costs."" The White House says China has been sending mixed messages. There were initial signs that Chinese state-owned banks were pulling back from financing Russian activities, according to a senior Biden administration official who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal analyses. But there have also been public comments by Chinese officials who expressed support for Russia being a strategic partner. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and senior Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi met in Rome this week for an intense, seven-hour talk  about the Russian invasion and other issues. Ahead of the Rome talks, Sullivan said the U.S. wouldn't abide China or any other country helping Russia work around economy-jarring sanctions inflicted by the U.S. and other allies since the Feb. 24 invasion. Sullivan also said the administration determined China knew that Putin “was planning something” before the invasion of Ukraine, but the Chinese government “may not have understood the full extent"" of what Putin had in mind. Xi and Putin met in early February, weeks before the invasion, with the Russian leader traveling to Beijing for the start of the Winter Olympics. The two leaders issued a 5,000-word statement declaring limitless “friendship.” Beijing's leaders would like to be supportive of Russia, but they also recognize how badly the Russian military action is going as an overmatched Ukrainian military has put up stiff resistance, according to a Western official familiar with current intelligence assessments. The official, who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Beijing is weighing the potential “reputational blowback” of being associated with the Russian camp. The Chinese response to Russia’s request for help is still being formulated, the official said. Though seen as siding with Russia, China has also reached out to Ukraine, with its ambassador to the country on Monday quoted as saying: “China is a friendly country for the Ukrainian people. As an ambassador, I can responsibly say that China will forever be a good force for Ukraine, both economically and politically.” “We have seen how great the unity of the Ukrainian people is, and that means its strength,” Fan Xianrong was quoted by Ukraine’s state news service Ukrinform as telling regional authorities in the western city of Lviv, where the Chinese Embassy has relocated to. Separately, in a reminder of China's threat to assert its claim to Taiwan by force, the Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong sailed through the Taiwan Strait on Friday, just hours before the Biden-Xi call, Taiwan's Defense Ministry said. Any conflict over the self-governing island democracy stands to involve the U.S., which is legally obligated to ensure Taiwan can defend itself and treats threats to the island as matters of “grave concern."" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said he had no details about the ship's passage through the strait, but added that “I believe the carrier has its routine training schedule, and it should not be linked with the communication between Chinese and American leaders."" State media quoted Xi as saying China-U.S. relations had yet to “emerge from the dilemma created by the previous U.S. administration, but instead encountered more and more challenges,” singling out Taiwan as one area in particular. “If the Taiwan issue is not handled properly, it will have an undermining impact on the relationship between the two countries,"" Xi reportedly told Biden. ___ Associated Press writers Jill Lawless in London andJosh Boak in Washington and AP news assistant Caroline Chen in Beijing contributed to this report.",World/Associated Press,"In video call, Biden presses China's Xi on Russia support",https://news.yahoo.com/biden-looks-assess-where-chinas-043657012.html
