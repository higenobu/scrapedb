12/24/2021,"Guido Vanham is a Belgian virologist who's been sending letters to his children during the pandemic. The text of his most recent letter is printed below with permission from his son Peter Vanham. Vanham says the virus will eventually weaken and meanwhile to keep following COVID-19 regulations.  Dear Peter, Johan, and Nele, Dear grandchildren,  Your mom and I are so very much looking forward to celebrating the holidays with you — and especially with the newest member of our family! We're so glad you're all safe and that Valeria had a good pregnancy and got herself protected by taking a vaccine (and soon a booster) early. We know you're worried also for the kids, who are facing a difficult situation in school. They now have to wear masks and are asked to get vaccinated even when they run a lower risk of getting sick themselves. You told me how even some of your friends reacted extremely to that news.  But I've read all the studies about it and it's very safe for the boys and children their age (5- to 12-year-olds) to get vaccinated. They also won't have much, if any, troubles from wearing a mask.  They might even like wearing a mask if you frame it right. They get to do what adults are doing and do their part in helping people from getting sick. My experience is that if you put a positive spin on it and ask them for their opinion, they're often more willing to be ""courageous"" than you might think.  As for our newly born granddaughter who's barely a month old: You're already through the most critical phase as Valeria got vaccinated during her pregnancy and with that protected herself and the baby. Even now as she breastfeeds, she passes on antibodies that help the baby protect herself.  Sadly, the Omicron ""variant"" of the COVID-19 virus is spreading all over the world now. And I know that you're wondering: What should we expect? Is this going to be the first wave all over again or will we be better off?  My assessment is: This may be the most contagious variant yet, with a possible tsunami of infections and sadly little effect of the vaccines on that front. We therefore are better safe than sorry and should do everything we can to protect ourselves and those around us.  Here's what I think you should know:  First, this Omicron ""variant"" is a new form of the COVID-19 virus, which causes a new wave of infections because it's somehow more potent than the previous variant. Omicron is both more contagious than previous variants (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta) and also escapes from the ""immunity"" the antibodies induced from the previous variants.   Omicron can infect people who have already been infected with previous variants and even those who were vaccinated several months ago. Moreover, Omicron is equally ""pathogenic"" as previous variants — i.e., it can cause serious disease leading to hospitalization, intense care, or even death.  As you know, our healthcare systems are currently still over-burdened by COVID-19 patients in hospitals and intensive-care wards. I hear that's the case for our local hospital and also for the one in Geneva. As a result, seriously ill people without COVID-19 but with cancer or other life-threatening conditions often have to wait for treatment.  That delay of necessary care for non-COVID-19 patients also causes unnecessary fear, suffering, and premature death. The ""Delta wave"" is now receding, but the ""Omicron wave"" is already unfolding with the overload of hospitals with COVID-19 patients and delays for non-COVID-19 care. You may have heard Dr. Anthony Fauci is predicting the same in the US.  (I have known of Dr. Fauci since I was researching HIV in the 1980s. He's an incredible scientist with a resume in infectious diseases that's equal to none. When he speaks, we should all listen.)  So what can we do together to avoid or certainly reduce the Omicron wave? Omicron remains sensitive to the vaccine, but less than Delta. That's why you need a third dose of the vaccine to help protect you from serious illness and hospitalization. Unfortunately, even three doses don't protect against the infection itself. If you've been vaccinated three times and still become infected, you'll often hardly notice it: You may have a ""common cold,"" a sore throat, and sometimes a fever. So I know you're all lining up for your boosters and you're doing the right thing.  Sometimes you don't feel anything at all and yet the virus is in your body for a few days and can be transmitted to other people. If you then infect someone who hasn't been vaccinated or who is vaccinated but is weakened, that person can become seriously ill with COVID-19. Not only very frail or old people are sensitive, but also middle-aged people with obesity, high blood pressure, chronic bronchitis, and diabetes, and even some apparently perfectly healthy youngsters or even children. A third shot of the vaccine is therefore important to protect yourself against disease. But even if you get a third shot, you can still transmit the Omicron virus and possibly make someone else ill. That's why we should all stick to the measures below because we know they greatly reduce the spread of each variant of the virus: Keep your distance and wear a face mask correctly when you're indoors with people who don't belong to your core family: at school, in the office, in a shop, on the public transport, in the town hall, and so on. Constantly ventilate rooms where you're together with many people with fresh air. You can do so by opening a window at home or by installing an air purifier (they're sold online and in many shops).  Wash your hands regularly. Definitely don't cough or sneeze in front of others, and make sure to keep your mask on when you speak. Sneezing, coughing, or speaking loudly to someone are the three most likely ways in which virus particles can spread and infect others.  If any of you have had close contact with an infected person, the rules of testing and quarantine (isolating yourself for one to two weeks) absolutely apply. That's also the case if any of the kids or your partners are infected. I know you'll have a lot of social contacts, so please be careful and follow those best practices.  As we will soon see each other for the holidays, it's not always possible to strictly follow all these rules. For example, if we're going to eat and drink together, you can't always wear your face mask and socially distance if you're in a small room.  Then it's really recommended that all people who plan to come together (including the children) do a self-test beforehand to make sure that no one would unknowingly become infected with the virus and spread it. This is very important if there are people who are old or weak — then everyone should certainly be tested.  (Your mom and I don't consider ourselves old and weak, but we're now in our late sixties and early seventies, so we have to be careful, too, and we'll get tested tomorrow ahead of the Christmas get-together.)  It's all annoying, but we live in a period when a dangerous virus is among us. It will remain that way all winter. What then is the prospect? The major vaccine companies are already working on a new vaccine specifically against Omicron. It could be ready as early as March and distributed shortly afterwards. We can be confident that the situation in the summer of 2022 will improve, just like in 2020 and 2021. That means we have something positive to look forward to in the near future. Because more and more people have been vaccinated and/or infected, the herd immunity (the resistance of all people through their antibodies) increases.  The virus can't endlessly create new strong variants, so it will eventually weaken and behave more like the flu virus. This pandemic will pass, just like the Spanish Flu a hundred years ago, but no one can predict when. I hope with all of you that this is our last COVID-19 winter, but I'm only a doctor and a scientist — and a father and grandfather — not a prophet … Take care, and let's hope we can still get together for the holidays, albeit extremely carefully,   Dad  Guido Vanham, medical doctor and specialist in virology and immunology Read the original article on Business Insider",Health/Business Insider,Read the letter a virologist sent his family on how to best protect themselves from the Omicron variant,https://news.yahoo.com/read-letter-virologist-sent-family-164207848.html
12/24/2021,"Seoul — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un looked grim at a ceremony to mark 10 years since his father's death over the weekend. But just over the border in Seoul, South Korea, a haircut was transforming Kim Min Yong, also known as Dragon Kim, into his alter ego. His adopted style, mirroring Kim Jong Un, is a convincing look, he says, but not exactly flattering. Dragon Kim's main work is counselling South Korean students as they apply for spots at prestigious American universities, but took his side hustle, impersonating the North Korean leader, online with his YouTube channel, KIMJONGUN TV. He offers a funny take on a deadly serious dictator, who's often shown in North Korean propaganda admiring new weapons in his arsenal — including a missile that could reach the United States. But is the faux Kim afraid of impersonating someone so powerful, especially after receiving online threats?  ""North Korean supporters say, 'if you mock our Dear Leader, you will be in trouble, like, big trouble!"" ""I was really scared,"" Dragon Kim admitted to CBS News. But with no serious reprisals after 10 years, he's still at it. There was one hiccup. In 2019, when Kim Jong Un met Donald Trump in Vietnam, Dragon Kim was there, too — doing his thing. Until, that is, the Vietnamese police picked him up and jailed him, just in case the visiting North Korean delegation was to find out about his antics and fail to take the joke. He said they kept him locked up for about six days. Vietnamese police aside, Dragon Kim has taken flak over the years. There's nothing funny, critics say, about a pitiless dictator. But he says they've missed the point. ""When I do Kim Jong Un impersonation, the funny things like the dancing and, you know, in public… I think that just helps to damage his authority,"" he told CBS News. And a little laughter may help him, and his fellow South Koreans live with the fact that the real Kim Jong Un is their next door neighbor, and he's starting his second decade in power, armed to the teeth.

12/24/2021,"Marjorie Taylor Greene owns stock in three major vaccine makers, financial-disclosure filings show. Greene holds AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson stock, each worth between $1,000 and $15,000. Greene has boasted about being unvaccinated and slammed ""vaccine Nazis"" last month. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has boasted about being unvaccinated against COVID-19, owns stock in three major vaccine makers, financial-disclosure filings analyzed by Insider show. Greene holds stock in AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson, each worth between $1,000 and $15,000, according to an August 13, 2020, filing from Greene with the clerk of the House of Representatives. The discovery was made as part of Insider's Conflicted Congress project, which revealed that multiple US lawmakers held stock in vaccine makers as the pandemic raged in 2020. The project found that at least 13 senators and 35 US representatives held shares in Johnson & Johnson, 11 senators and 34 representatives held shares in Pfizer, and two representatives or their spouses held shares of Moderna. In September, Greene told Insider: ""I have an independent investment advisor that has full discretionary authority on my accounts. I do not direct any trades."" Despite her financial interest in vaccine stocks, Greene says she isn't vaccinated and has decried those trying to make her get the shot. In an episode of Steve Bannon's ""War Room"" podcast released November 2, Greene said ""vaccine Nazis"" were ""ruining our country."" The issue of Greene's vaccine assets has been seized on by Jennifer Strahan, who is running against her for Congress in Georgia's 14th district. Last week Strahan held a Twitter poll in which she asked, ""Which of the following COVID vaccine manufacturers does @mtgreenee currently own stock in?"" She listed AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, or ""all of the above"" as choices. ""For those of you wondering, the correct answer is D! Our current representative rails against the vaccine, but owns stock in 3 of the 4 major vaccine manufacturers,"" Strahan wrote in a follow-up tweet. Speaking at Turning Point USA's ""AmericaFest"" conference on Sunday, Greene reiterated her disdain for vaccines. ""I'm not vaccinated, and they're going to have a hell of a time if they want to hold me down and give me a vaccine,"" she said.

12/24/2021,"A man and woman have been released on bail after they were arrested for child cruelty following the discovery of a two-year-old boy wandering alone on a freezing Essex street. Basildon resident Claire Graves shared the terrifying moment when the boy ran out into the road in Ballards Walk as she was driving by on Tuesday (December 21). The 35-year-old said the boy, dressed in a onesie was completely alone and ""freezing"". She attempted to find his parents for nearly half an hour to no avail before calling the police. The mother-of-two said: ""I was driving along Ballards Walk by the surgery, out of nowhere this tiny little boy starts running from the opposite side of the road. ""I jumped out of the car, while it was still moving, grabbed him and pulled him out of the way of incoming traffic. ""I tried to console him, he was screaming out and freezing cold. ""He was beside himself, very scared, I was trying to comfort him and tried to find his mum.” Ms Graves said she's relieved that the boy is now safe, but has been left shaken by the incident. She added: ""It's three days before Christmas, it breaks my heart that stuff like this really happens. ""I was very shocked, I was worried for him.” A spokesman for Essex Police told Yahoo News UK that a 39-year-old man and a 44-year-old woman have been released on bail until 10 January following their arrest. They added: ”We were called at around 9.47am on Tuesday, 21 December to an incident in Basildon. ""A member of the public discovered an unaccompanied young child, aged two, at Gladwyns. ""The child was uninjured and enquiries established who the child was. He is now in the care of a partner organisation. ""Specialist officers from Public Protection Unit are leading the investigation. ""A 39-year-old man and a 44-year-old woman have been arrested on suspicion of child cruelty (neglect).” Watch: What are the Holiday Blues?

12/24/2021,"TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese and U.S. armed forces have drawn up a draft plan for a joint operation for a possible Taiwan emergency, Japan's Kyodo news agency said on Thursday, citing unnamed Japanese government sources, amid increased tensions between the island and China. China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own ""sacred"" territory and in the past two years has stepped up military and diplomatic pressure to assert its sovereignty claims, fuelling anger in Taipei and deep concern in Washington. Taiwan's government says it wants peace, but will defend itself if needed. Under the plan, the U.S. Marine Corps will set up temporary bases on the Nansei island chain stretching from Kyushu, one of the four main islands of Japan, to Taiwan, at the initial stage of a Taiwan emergency, and will deploy troops, Kyodo said. Japanese armed forces will provide logistical support in such areas as ammunition and fuel supplies, it said. Japan, former colonial ruler of Taiwan, and the United States would likely reach an agreement to start formulating an official plan at a ""2+2"" meeting of foreign and defence ministers early next year, the news agency said. Japanese defence ministry officials were not immediately available for comment. China views democratic Taiwan as a wayward province, awaiting the day the island can be brought under its control - peacefully or militarily - with no right to state-to-state relations. The United States, like most countries in the world, recognises China over Taiwan, in line with Beijing's ""one China"" policy. But Washington is the island's biggest arms supplier and ally and is obliged by law to help it defend itself.
