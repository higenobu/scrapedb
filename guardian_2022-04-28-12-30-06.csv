4/28/2022,"On Wednesday morning, the Australian newspaper made good on its longstanding threat to launch a dedicated youth media title. The Oz went live, along with accounts on Instagram, TikTok, and, for some reason, LinkedIn, bringing with it large helpings of derision from the predicted corners. Hello my youths, it's me, Gregory Shart-Bonnett, deputy culture war editor at the Oz, The Australian's new youth outlet. What's crackalackin? Do you think department stores should do more to make Christian customers feel welcome? Drop some ""fire"" in the comments box if you agree i am officially obsessed with The Australian's youth website pic.twitter.com/mVPpMkN9fc The Australian’s last attempt to reach a younger audience was when Business Review editor-at-large, Ticky Fullerton, wrote, performed and recorded a six-minute rap about how workers should go back to the office. At least on a superficial first impression, The Oz seems to be offering less mortifying content than that. Skin care tips and horoscopes sit alongside good articles about rising student debt and checking your fertility in your twenties. The editorial and production teams are 100% female, and decades younger than the typical editorial lineup of the Australian, which has become a byword for old, white, male, rich, reactionary and culture war-obsessed. But the existence of the Oz itself raises some big and obvious questions. Who exactly is it for? Why launch a youth media site in 2022, years after the industry’s heyday? And how will the Oz reconcile its attempts to project a progressive, youthful image with its parent company? Hey kids, it's The Oz. The cool new youth outlet from The Australian. We've got news and views for you zoomers. Also please do not click on any other part of the website where decrepit lunatics who are paid way more than us write the most heinous offensive shit you've ever seen TEEN AT SKATEPARK: yoooo! The Australian just launched its youth portal, THE OZ!TEEN 2: *flossing* poggers!TEEN 3: *vaping* yo I hear Peter Craven is dropping his top 10 Elden Ring builds!!!TEEN 1: I can’t wait to read Albrechtson’s take on MattyB!!!ALL [dabbing]: RADICAL Youth media is a strange and complicated place. Locally, the big titles are Junkee, Pedestrian and SBS’s The Feed, along with multinational brands like BuzzFeed, VICE and LADBible. Offices are filled with ping pong tables and graffiti, Every Word In Headlines Is Capitalised For No Reason, and white editors in their thirties Google phrases like “yaaas kween” before putting them in stories. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It’s also an industry in flux. Largely text-based websites are struggling to redefine themselves as younger audiences leave Facebook for photo- and video-based platforms like Instagram and TikTok. As their original readership ages out of the “youth” demographic (vaguely defined as under 35), titles somehow have to reach younger audiences while staying relevant to their existing readers. (For Junkee, where I used to work, this split apparently couldn’t be reconciled; instead they launched a whole new site for younger readers, and called it Punkee.) And while many have cultivated large and loyal audiences, very few have solved the all-important question of how to turn views into money. After building a massive domestic presence, BuzzFeed Australia fell victim to global staff cuts in 2019 and is now a shadow of its former self. All trace of The Vocal, Fairfax’s attempt at a youth offering, has vanished. NOVA’s GOAT hasn’t been updated in months. The Oz has its work cut out for it, even without the particular problems it faces as a News Corp title. How will its young editorial team respond to the Australian’s coverage of trans issues? How will it cover climate change, which young Australians using the ABC’s Vote Compass have nominated as their most important election issue, but about which the Australian has a history of publishing falsehoods? As The Australian launches a youth oriented website, The Oz, let's remember that publication's pathetic hand wringing over ABC Life.They were obsessed, in a way that was completely unwarranted and, let's be honest, a bit creepy.Four years is a long time in digital media hey. pic.twitter.com/VW4oiJBJTX It’s premature to jump to hard conclusions just yet, but early signs are not encouraging. Some very Australian-esque articles are squirrelled away among the ones about binge-watching TV and the iPhone 13. In a piece about the end of Covid restrictions, Oz politics and investigations reporter and former press gallery journalist Olivia Caisley asks: “Were the two years of isolation, loneliness, and missing out on hugs and personal milestones worth it?” For the tens of thousands of Australians who didn’t die, the answer is: probably! Coverage of the new security pact between China and Solomon Islands features cut-and-pasted block quotes from Australian foreign editor Greg Sheridan, and Australian correspondents repeating familiar criticism of the Greens. The Oz’s multiple articles covering the confected outrage around trans women competing in women’s sport contain exactly zero quotes from trans people or experts, instead quoting politicians’ talking points without interrogation. In 2017, the Liberal party launched The Fair Go, a youth site that then acting federal party director Andrew Bragg claimed would “level the playing field in Australian democracy”. Unsurprisingly, it was a disaster. Young readers didn’t jump at the chance to read gif-riddled stories about unions supposedly stealing their super, or how “small businesses are our everyday heroes”. A Junkee investigation found that The Fair Go’s design had deliberately modelled itself on Junkee, right down to the custom fonts and layouts. Two months after launch, the site went dark. The Oz isn’t quite The Fair Go. But it’s not not it, either.",News/Media,The Australian has launched a new youth title. But who exactly is it for?

4/28/2022,"Scott Morrison and other government MPs are accusing Labor of planning to introduce a “sneaky carbon tax” by – wait for it – using an existing Coalition policy as it was intended. Sounds ridiculous, right? Election campaign shamelessness on steroids. But there is a lot going on here and it is worth stepping through it. The awkwardly named safeguard mechanism was created by Greg Hunt, the former environment minister and introduced under then prime minister Tony Abbott, a well-known climate sceptic. It was legislated in 2014 as part of what was then known as the Coalition’s “direct action” policy. The idea was that emissions limits would be set for the country’s biggest industrial sites, those that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. The limits – known as baselines – would stop “rogue” polluters from significantly increasing emissions and effectively wiping out any cuts the government paid for from farmers and others through its emissions reduction fund. The baselines were meant to “safeguard” those cuts. If a company went over its baseline it would have to buy carbon credits to offset the extra pollution pumped into the atmosphere. In practice, that hasn’t happened. Industrial emissions continue to increase – by 7% since the safeguard was introduced – as the government has mostly just allowed companies to increase baselines, or change the timeframe over which baselines are measured, without penalty. Industry representatives, climate activists and analysts believe it has made the scheme a waste of time and have long called for an overhaul. The government has refused to acknowledge that industrial emissions are an issue that need to be addressed now. Official government projections show they are not expected to be cut before 2030 under the Coalition’s policies. The government’s ambition for the safeguard mechanism has reduced since its early days. Shortly before the landmark Paris climate conference in 2015, Hunt included it as part of Australia’s pledge to the summit and said it would be developed to cut emissions from industrial polluters by 200m tonnes between 2020 and 2030. But the ministers who followed him – Josh Frydenberg, Melissa Price and Angus Taylor – have not repeated that claim, and the Coalition now has no plans to require industrial polluters to cut emissions. Instead, it assumes cleaner technology will eventually lead to businesses taking voluntary steps to deliver most emissions cuts. It has not explained the basis for this assumption in any detail. The Business Council of Australia, which in the past had campaigned for the abolition of the country’s carbon pricing scheme and described a science-based emissions target as “economy wrecking”, last year had something of a reversal on climate policy. In October, the business council called for Australia’s climate target for 2030 to be increased to a 46% to 50% cut – more than Labor’s 43%, and nearly twice as much as the Coalition’s 26-28% – and released a policy blueprint. It said the safeguard should be “enhanced and expanded” to “deliver a strong carbon investment signal to invest in new low, zero and negative emissions technology”. Others, including the Australian Industry Group, support this position. Labor’s safeguard policy, released in December, basically adopted the business council’s recommendations. It said if it was in government the baselines for the 215 major industrial sites covered by the safeguard would be cut “predictably and gradually” in a way that supported “international competitiveness and economic growth”. Big emitting export industries – coalmines, for example – would get “tailored treatment” to ensure they weren’t disadvantaged against other countries where there was not an equivalent scheme in place. Opposition MPs appeared to stumble trying to explain this, with some suggesting coalmines in the Hunter valley would be exempt, while the opposition climate change and energy spokesperson, Chris Bowen, said they would be included but their circumstances meant they wouldn’t face a hit. It was mostly a semantic difference but it underlined that there are many details still to come if Labor wins. Modelling for the ALP by RepuTex suggests it could use the safeguard to cut emissions by 213m tonnes by 2030 – roughly similar to what Hunt proposed back in 2015 – while creating 1,600 mostly regional jobs. The policy said officials would work out new baselines in consultation with industry on a case-by-case basis. Power generation is not included in the safeguard, but fossil fuel exports – coal and gas – are. Labor says that demand for thermal coal and liquified natural gas exports will fall as the world cuts emissions, but it would not penalise those industries against overseas competitors while people want to buy their product. The Coalition’s net zero plan also acknowledges a long-term decline for coal and gas but has a different emphasis. It says both industries “will continue through to 2050 and beyond, supporting jobs and regional communities”. Given carbon capture and storage’s lack of economic viability, that appears to be banking on the world failing to address the crisis, a situation that would lead to worsening extreme weather and climate disasters. Among the parties, only the Greens say Australia has a responsibility to significantly cut emissions from fossil fuel export industries in line with climate science. They want a levy on coal exports that would be used to fund climate disaster recovery and development of new clean exports, and for the industry to end by 2030. Morrison this week said the government had “put incentives in place” while “what Labor is doing is binding them on this and issuing penalties on those companies”. What did that mean? Is it fair? It’s not exactly clear what incentives Morrison was referring to, but it seems likely he means a proposal to create a “safeguard crediting mechanism” that would allow companies that cut emissions below their baseline to earn credits they could sell. It was among the recommendations of a review in 2020 ordered by Taylor. It is a contentious change – currently, some businesses have baselines set well above what they actually emit. If that was not properly addressed, the government could end up giving away credits to industry that has not made cuts. The government has consulted industry on the design of this scheme and allocated $279.9m in funding over 10 years to buy credits. But the plan has yet not been introduced – so there are no “incentives in place”. Labor has proposed a similar change, but also released few details. Both models sound a fair bit like a form of carbon trading but neither side concedes this. As for Labor issuing penalties, Bowen has estimated about half of the cuts under the ALP safeguard plan could come from businesses using better technology, supported by a new $15bn national reconstruction fund. There are no penalties involved there. The other half would come from industry buying carbon credits to offset their emissions. That already happens now, to a lesser extent. As Guardian Australia has reported, the Coalition model required 14 companies to buy 419,000 carbon credits at an estimated cost of more than $15m last financial year for breaching their emissions baselines. Both parties plan to significantly expand the use of carbon credits, which have been in the news of late due to concerns over their credibility. Under its net zero plan, the Coalition says credits could deliver up to 20% of the emissions cuts needed by mid-century. It has not explained who would pay for these. No. As Katharine Murphy has pointed out, it is not a tax now, and won’t be under Labor’s changes. It is a scheme to limit and hopefully reduce pollution. Companies that go above their limit are required to offset the damage. That is not a tax under any normal definition. The bottom line is that the safeguard is a Coalition policy that has barely been used, but most experts think could be. Labor has strategically adopted its opponent’s model after repeat scare campaigns left it bruised and gun-shy on climate. The Morrison government has built a hard-earned reputation as a global laggard on climate. It stuck with a low, seven-year-old 2030 emissions target despite significant international pressure, has no significant policies to cut emissions in that timeframe and claims a 20% emissions cut since 2005 despite most of that having come before it was elected in 2013. It has a net zero emissions plan for 2050 that assumes the bulk of the work will come later, at odds with climate science advice, and does not actually add up to net zero. Despite the subsequent denials, LNP candidate and climate sceptic Colin Boyce was on to something this week when he said there is wriggle room in the net zero commitment. Meanwhile, Morrison is suggesting using the Coalition’s policy to do what it was designed to would be economically disastrous. That should be treated as what it is: a scare campaign and an argument for inaction.",News/Environment,Calling the safeguard mechanism a ‘sneaky carbon tax’ is a scare campaign and an argument for inaction | Temperature Check,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/28/calling-the-safeguard-mechanism-a-sneaky-carbon-tax-is-a-scare-campaign-and-an-argument-for-inaction
