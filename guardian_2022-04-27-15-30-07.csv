4/27/2022,"“Children pick up whether someone cares about them even if they don’t speak the language,” says Kulvarn Atwal, a headteacher in east London. Atwal, who has plenty of experience of welcoming children who are refugees from conflict, is preparing for the arrival of new pupils from Ukraine. Children connect with each other much faster than adults do, he says. “Sometimes we look at children through the eyes of adults, but they don’t see what adults see. They haven’t developed discriminatory biases so they just dive straight in.” As the summer term begins, many schools are preparing to welcome children who have fled Ukraine after the Russian invasion. For some schools, particularly in rural areas, it could be their first experience of teaching refugees. Atwal has told his local council he will take “as many Ukrainian children as possible”, to Uphall primary, his school in Ilford, where 60 languages are spoken, to make use of the school’s experience. He says he also wanted “to send an important message to our children that we are doing something”. For children who arrive speaking no English, often after traumatic experiences, starting a new school in a new country is daunting. But they typically go on to thrive. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, himself arrived aged nine from Iraq speaking no English. How do teachers manage to help such children to adapt and make progress? “As soon as they get here, we give them a buddy, another student, who supports them all day long,” says Atwal. “Everyone wants to volunteer. If they walk into a classroom and children are fighting to look after them; they love that.” Uphall employs an emotional literacy adviser, who helps children who may have suffered trauma. If a child does not speak much English the adviser will use picture cards showing an angry face and ask: “Do you ever feel like this?” Atwal emphasises that each child needs to be treated as an individual. Some will be very quiet at first, taking it all in, “but that doesn’t mean they don’t feel safe”. “Many children who have fled a country come from very educated backgrounds,” he says. “We see groups of refugees in the press, but every child has their own story.” In January, a month before the invasion of Ukraine, Atwal heard about a large number of refugee children housed in a bed and breakfast nearby. He offered them places and invited the families in to meet him. They did not speak English and were “clearly traumatised” by what they had experienced. Some of the parents were disabled as a result of war. With no access to public funds, none could afford bus fares to school. For most of these uprooted families Atwal says the practical challenges of getting their children to school each day were too much. But a handful of children joined, and he says they have settled in happily. Teachers preparing to welcome new Ukrainian children are sharing advice on social media, and requests for help from small charities, like the Schools of Sanctuary network, are mushrooming. Oliver Wilson, head of Woodhouse primary school, part of the University of Wolverhampton multi-academy trust, says: “The biggest thing is the warm welcome.” Wilson’s school has enrolled children who have fled Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and the Congo. Before the children start, he invites the family to come into school to meet him and his team. An interpreter will be there to help, often a member of a family already at the school. Wilson is always mindful the new family may have had “a horrific journey” and “witnessed terrible things”. A small thing like making sure to smile can help, he says. Before a new refugee joined recently, a child from the same country knocked on his door and asked if she could show her around. “Her whole family offered support, giving a great welcome, because they knew what it felt like to be new,” Wilson says. The school has an expert English as an additional language [EAL] teacher, something many schools now lack because of funding cuts in the past 10 years. One thing that works well is using the doll’s house: a chance to learn practical everyday words by pointing at objects and playing. Wilson says: “You can’t just put them in a class in a totally new system and language and expect them to flourish. We give them time, adult conversation and the opportunity to develop confidence.” Wilson says once the children have been given time to settle, start to learn the language and begin to overcome challenges such as bereavement or PTSD, they “can really fly academically”. But he says what matters most is that they find school a safe and welcoming place. In March, a video of an entire Italian school clapping as their two new Ukrainian classmates arrived went viral on social media, with many people saying it moved them to tears. But Megan Greenwood, coordinator for the Schools of Sanctuary programme, urges caution. “A big fanfare welcome is not necessarily going to be helpful for someone who is very new to the country and feeling unsettled.” Her advice: “Don’t bring a newly arrived child on to stage in assembly.” She suggests smaller, “less conspicuous” gestures, such as putting up signs written by classmates in Ukrainian. The Schools of Sanctuary scheme has recognised 341 nurseries, schools and sixth forms in the UK for supporting children who have had to flee and educating others about their situation. Greenwood describes one student arriving at a sixth form college recently during a day of solidarity for Ukraine. “They didn’t announce that he had come from there, but he was really touched when he turned up and there were yellow and blue flags everywhere.” Helen Giblett, head of Archbishop Benson primary school in Truro, says her pupils have each planted a sunflower, Ukraine’s national flower, to show the Ukrainian children joining the school that they are “ready to welcome and support them”. The school took in Syrian refugees a few years ago and Giblett says some of those children are now raising issues to do with their experience because the war in Ukraine has brought them to the fore. “We focus on listening,” she says. “Often children won’t even realise they are receiving special support, which might be through drawing or talking.” Greenwood says these children need a “safe person” on the staff who they can always turn to, as well as a safe space in which to decompress. Some schools have a teacher who leads on refugee support. “If a child puts up their hand in class and says they want to see this teacher, all members of staff understand what that means,” Greenwood says. Lack of English is one of the most obvious obstacles. The Bell Foundation, a language education charity, runs webinars on welcoming refugees and is offering training and free resources to schools taking Ukrainians. Silvana Richardson, the charity’s strategic education adviser, says children need English language support for six years. “It should be in the classroom as much as possible, so children socialise with their peers.” She advises schools to teach children some basic emotional language early on, “so that they can tell someone when they are tired, sad or need some time out”. Jasmine Kay, a year 6 teacher at Wood Ley primary school, Stowmarket, which has just applied to become the first sanctuary school in Suffolk, says that being immersed in a new language can be exhausting. “Allowing brain breaks and additional time to play and relax can be essential.” Kay’s pupils recently made cards for local refugee families. She points out that welcoming new children offers a chance for schools to talk about migration and why diversity is a strength, as well as making pupils consider how they would feel if they had been the ones forced to flee. “We should show solidarity to our fellow human beings and treat them as we would like to be treated if the roles were reversed,” she says.",News/Education,‘They can really fly’: how to teach a refugee child,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/27/they-can-really-fly-how-to-teach-a-refugee-child
4/27/2022,"Good morning. This time last week, a Ukrainian marine commander fighting in Mariupol posted a video message on Facebook saying that his soldiers were “maybe facing our last days, if not hours.” But the Ukrainian forces holed up at the Azovstal iron and steelworks are still there. That might seem like the kind of story of extraordinary resistance that has coloured our view of the war in Ukraine – but the reality is much darker. And this morning the remaining Ukrainian soldiers and civilians in the city remain trapped after Vladimir Putin rejected a new appeal from UN secretary general António Guterres to allow the UN to help in an evacuation. For today’s newsletter, I’ve spoken to Peter Beaumont, an experienced foreign correspondent for the Guardian and Observer who has been covering the conflict since it began. He gave us a hugely useful guide to what’s happening in Mariupol – and what the last days of battle there tell us about the wider war. That’s right after the headlines. One other quick note – we’ve had loads of useful feedback on First Edition so far, most of it positive, which is a relief. (Thanks!) But one thing mentioned by a lot of people is that they’d like sport headlines, so we’re bringing that in from today – including a report on an incredible Champions League game which annoyingly I had to go to bed before the end of. You’ll find them right below In depth. If you haven’t already, please do hit reply and tell us what you think. Music | The former BBC DJ Tim Westwood has been accused of sexual misconduct by seven women over 25 years, the Guardian and BBC revealed in a joint investigation. All the women who have come forward are black. Westwood denied the allegations. Politics | The editor of the Mail on Sunday has refused a meeting with the House of Commons speaker over an article accusing Labour’s Angela Rayner of “Basic Instinct” tactics. Rayner said yesterday she had begged the newspaper not to run the story. Russia | Moscow has told Poland and Bulgaria it will halt gas supplies from Wednesday, following their refusal to pay the Russian energy giant Gazprom in roubles, in an apparent warning shot to the rest of Europe. Politics | Former Conservative MP Imran Ahmad Khan, convicted of molesting a 15-year-old boy, sat on an expert panel on grooming gangs while under police investigation. The Home Office said it had been unaware of the accusations. Twitter | The UK and EU warned the social media platform must comply with new content rules or face sanctions ranging from fines to a total ban, as concerns were raised that hate speech will increase under the ownership of Elon Musk. Mariupol is a crucial battle – not just a symbolic one In the two months since Russia’s invasion, the battle for Mariupol has made the city famous. The devastation wreaked by the invading forces, exodus of hundreds of thousands of refugees and dogged resistance of a relatively small number of Ukrainian troops faced with siege tactics mean that questions over its future are central to how we think about the war. “It’s simple to grasp some of this,” says Peter. “The particular circumstances of a city that was already partly cut off [by the Russian-occupied Donbas and Donetsk regions and the sea] mean that it was easier to encircle. Its treatment has been utterly brutal but it’s also ultimately consistent with Russian tactics elsewhere.” But Russia’s siege is much more than symbolic. “You want your defensive positions to be able to support each other, and Russia is trying to kick away the legs on the chair,” Peter said. “It makes defending the rest of the coast much harder. Mariupol is a proper port, with big, deep berths designed for steel shipments and grain bulk carriers. You can use it to resupply your forces. And you severely damage the Ukrainian economy. They gain a significant advantage in the war and set terms for future peace negotiations by cutting Ukraine off from the sea.” To all intents and purposes, the city has already fallen While some Ukrainian forces remain holed up in the city’s steelworks, local officials estimate that about 80% of Mariupol’s prewar population of 500,000 have fled, with 21,000 dead. About 90% of the buildings are destroyed. (“We are prepared to leave the city because there is nothing left to defend,” Captain Svyatoslav Palamar, one of the soldiers at the steelworks, recently told the New York Times.) Meanwhile, the estimated 5-10,000 Russian forces in the area can act with impunity. Vladimir Putin said yesterday that there was no more fighting in the city. “There is no question to me that the Ukrainians are surrounded and cut off from supply lines,” said Peter. “There’s nobody coming to rescue them. It’s just a question of how horrible the end will be.” The risk of a ground attack on the last Ukrainian troops is high – and the reward is small An estimated 1,000 Ukrainian forces – as well as hundreds of civilians – are thought to be located at the Azovstal steelworks, a sprawling complex covering about four square miles with a network of passages in its basement. Metinvest, which owns the steel mill, says that the bunkers below ground were used as shelters in 2014 during a previous attempt on the city by Russian-backed separatists and were stocked with enough food and water to last 4,000 people three weeks. This image suggests the intricacies of the site that would make a direct assault risky for an attacking force: In those circumstances, says Peter, there may have been some misunderstanding of the reasons for Russia’s reluctance to go in on the ground even as it continues to shell the site. “Perhaps some people have slightly got the narrative wrong when the Kremlin said we’re going to seal it off, as if this was a Russian defeat.” Peter points out that the presence at the site of the Azov battalion, a unit linked to the far right with a significant neo-Nazi contingent, means that “in propaganda terms, pictures of these guys stumbling out with their hands up would be a much bigger win than potentially losing hundreds of soldiers by trying to raise a Russian flag over the steelworks.” The news has dried up – but the suffering isn’t over Mariupol has not had heat, power, gas, or electricity since the beginning of March. There have been claims – as recently as yesterday – of Russian attacks on humanitarian corridors as civilians have tried to flee, and Ukrainian officials say that about 40,000 people have been forcibly deported to Russia. Russia has also been accused of deliberately hiding evidence of war crimes by burying bodies in mass graves, like those shown just below the road in this satellite image: While claims of atrocities cannot be confirmed by reporters on the ground, that speaks to another reason for a brief lull in reporting on the city: the difficulty of getting the story out. “People can’t charge their phones, and even the military are able to communicate less,” said Peter. “I haven’t been able to reach anyone there recently. There’s no functioning humanitarian corridor, and so people aren’t picking up stories outside because nobody is coming out to say what’s going on.” Russia’s strategy tells us how it aims to succeed in the war Even after the situation at Azovstal is resolved, there may be insurgent resistance in Mariupol – “But that will take time,” Peter said. “Until then, this is the kind of fighting where Russia has the advantage. The blitzkrieg approach to Kyiv failed, and their vulnerability on logistics was a disaster. But here, it shows that when they can get around places, and bring artillery to bear with solid supply lines, it will take a long time, but they can prevail, at least for now.” That dynamic is similar to the fighting now taking place in the east of Ukraine, and suggests that Russia has reshaped the conflict according to its advantages. “The Russian military is a big, cranky, horrible machine,” Peter said. “Bits may keep falling off, but it keeps grinding on.” Football | Manchester City beat Real Madrid 4-3 in a classic Champions League semi-final first leg. City led by two goals three times but were pegged back by Madrid’s Karim Benzema. “The brain reeled taking this in,” writes Barney Ronay. Tennis | Wimbledon chiefs have defended a ban on Russian and Belarusian tennis players from the championships in solidarity with Ukraine. Novak Djokovic will defend his title in June as the vaccination mandate has now been lifted. Football | The Philippines qualified for the women’s World Cup in 2023 with a remarkable win against Taiwan in the Women’s Asian Cup. It’s the first time the country has sent any team to an international football tournament. Hamilton Nolan wrote a blistering analysis of Elon Musk’s $44bn purchase of Twitter. We’re all missing the point, Nolan argues: this isn’t about free speech, or Elon Musk’s moral failings, or even Twitter itself, but about the absurd wealth of billionaires. “This is just a preview. In the future, the billionaire toys won’t be quite so fun,” he writes.

4/27/2022,"It’s pop art, but not as you know it. Robbie Williams is the latest in a long list of musicians to have branched out into painting as another way to express themselves, but will it entertain you? His fine art foray will be shown at the auction house Sotheby’s next month, adding to the growing gallery of pop star art. Over the years exhibitions have featured the work of musicians including Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell. Their works have not always been well received. As long ago as 1999, the art critic Brian Sewell said he was sick of the “infuriating tendency among clapped out old pop stars to become artists”. Such critical scorn does not seem to have deterred musicians turning to art. The Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood said that rarely a day goes by without painting. Should they stick to music? We asked A-level art examiner Deborah Philpott, who is also a Superprof art tutor, to grade works by six musicians including Williams. The results were mixed with some only scraping a pass at A-level. But the examiner generously praised the individuality on display. Philpott says: “All the candidates were able to respond in a creative and individual manner with strong connections to their own environment. They all showed a creative response to media and materials, which demonstrated meaningful and considered outcomes.” She added: “All the work was personal, some being more contextually informed and driven by the work of other artists. Each piece reflected the candidates own interpretation of subject matter close to their hearts.” Robbie Williams A-level grade B or 6 Collaborative piece, which has repetitive images, symbols and mark making, recalling work such as Aboriginal paintings and the work of the American artist Jackson Pollock. The image reflects an interest in pop art and the more recent work of street artists such as Banksy. Interesting use of media and imagery that creates a mesmeric outcome responding to the environment and sounds that were created in the studio. Paul McCartney A-level grade C or 4/5 Expressive and strong use of colour and mark making, with a personal, emotional and intuitive response to his subject matter. Experimental use of media with a limited palette and a playful range of mark making. Kurt Cobain A-level grade D or 3 Loose interpretation of scale and shape that nonetheless captures a lively imagination with a strong sense of colour, line and tone. Some consideration to proportion and compositional arrangement, producing an emotional response to an unsettling image. Joni Mitchell A-level grade B or 6 Vibrant and energetic use of colour and mark making, interpreting the conventions of still life and portraiture, making an exciting composition with a riot of shapes and textures. Lively combination of figurative and abstract qualities with a nod to post-impressionism. Chrissie Hynde A-level grade A or 7/8 Shows a sound understanding of the conventions of early 20th-century art. Vivid use of colour with bold use of abstract shapes and form. Expressive use of brush marks with skilful use of proportion and composition. Ronnie Wood A level grade B or 6 Great energy in the use of media and mark making. Good use of tone, understanding of proportion and sense of movement. Demonstrates proficient drawing skill and an ability to capture mood and movement at the scene of an event.",Arts/Art and design,Let me educate you: an art tutor’s verdict on art by Robbie Williams and other stars,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/27/robbie-williams-art-a-level-examiner-verdict
4/27/2022,"When I was 26, I went to see a new GP. She scribbled down some notes and then said something that surprised me. “Do you feel like Job?” I let the silence hang and grimaced before I gave my reply. “Yes,” I said. I hadn’t dared tell anyone that I felt like the Old Testament character who loses everything, but I did. Two years before, I had come back from a holiday with a pain in my left ankle which then spread up to my knee. Within a few days, I had such excruciating pain in both knees that I struggled to walk. I had seen doctor after doctor, but no one seemed to know what was wrong. Blood tests had been lost. A year on, a receptionist had told me over the phone that they had been found and that I had an autoimmune disease called lupus. The medical dictionary said there was no cure. I told the new GP about the pain, the blood tests, the unemployment and the loss of hope. I even told her about the loss of faith. At 14, I had gone to a Christian youth club to meet boys, but ended up finding God. When the twisting pains hit a decade later, people at church told me that God wanted to heal me. I had tried to believe, but healing hadn’t come. A few weeks before seeing that doctor, I decided that if God wouldn’t help me, I would no longer try to serve him. I told him – literally, in black ink in my diary – to fuck off and decided that I would face the future alone. That doctor referred me to a psychotherapist, who encouraged me to apply for work in spite of the pain. One day, I heard that I had two interviews. The first was for a role as a proofreader on Loot, an advertising listings magazine. The second was for a two-day-a-week job at the Southbank Centre to do “literary PR”. The interview at the Southbank Centre was the day before the interview for Loot. When I look back, more than 30 years later, I see this as my Sliding Doors moment. It was a few years before the film came out, offering two different futures to a heroine played by Gwyneth Paltrow, depending on whether she caught or missed a train. In one of my two futures, I could have spent years proofreading ads for secondhand Zanussi freezers, as the twisting pains in my knees got worse. Instead, I was interviewed by the Southbank press officer, Ros Fry, and the literature officer, Maura Dooley, who had started the literature programme at the Southbank Centre and revived Poetry International, a festival first started by Ted Hughes. When Maura called to tell me I’d got the job – a part-time freelance gig – I felt like someone clinging to an iceberg, who is thrown a lifeline by a passing ship. I was able to drive my ancient Ford Fiesta to work, park next to the Royal Festival Hall and get a lift up to the fifth-floor office. It was still painful to walk and stand, but now I had a reason to push through the pain. Maura and her colleagues organised about 120 events a year. I went to most of them and read books by as many of the writers as I could. When my colleagues invited me to join them for a San Miguel in the bar, I felt a rush of pride. I was working with people who loved poetry, fiction, art and dance! After years of trying to fit in, in churches, Christian unions, Bible study groups and even evangelical missions, I felt I had found my tribe. Gradually, the pain in my joints started to fade. When I wasn’t working I went with colleagues to gigs and exhibitions. On a Friday night, we’d all go to the main Festival Hall bar. Sometimes, a group of us would meet in a pub for Sunday lunch. I had always dreamed of having a mixed group of friends who were interested in art and ideas; I could hardly believe that my dream had come true. When a colleague who worked full-time on the literature programme decided to leave, I applied for her job and got it. Now I was the one organising, or helping to organise, events, introducing writers and taking them out for dinner. In those years, I met almost every living writer I had heard of and many I hadn’t. I met Seamus Heaney, Susan Sontag, Doris Lessing, Umberto Eco, Ted Hughes and many, many others. I just wish I had written down some of the things they said. I worked at the Southbank Centre for eight years. It healed me. I really believe that doing work I loved, with people I loved, played a huge part in helping me get better. Thank God I saw that ad. And yes, I do mean that metaphorically. Christina Patterson’s new book, Outside, the Sky is Blue is published by Tinder Press.

4/27/2022,"As inflation shot to a new peak in March, cost increases exacted a deep toll on the economy, eating into most Americans’ wages and further imperiling the financially vulnerable. But for many of the US’s largest companies and their shareholders it has been a very different story. One widely accepted narrative holds that companies and consumers are sharing in inflationary pain, but a Guardian analysis of top corporations’ financials and earnings calls reveals most are enjoying profit increases even as they pass on costs to customers, many of whom are struggling to afford gas, food, clothing, housing and other basics. The analysis of Securities and Exchange Commission filings for 100 US corporations found net profits up by a median of 49%, and in some individual cases by as much as 111,000%. Those increases came as companies saddled customers with higher prices and all but ten executed massive stock buyback programs or bumped dividends to enrich investors. In earnings calls, executives detailed how even as demand and profits rose post-vaccine, they passed on most or all inflationary costs to customers via price increases, and some took the opportunity to add more on top. Margins – the share of sales converted into profits – also improved for the majority of the companies analyzed by the Guardian. Economists who reviewed the data say it’s more evidence of a clear reality: Consumers are taking a financial hit as companies and shareholders profit or are largely shielded. “It’s obvious that corporations are trying to pass on any form of short-term pain they might be feeling … and that’s serving the top, wealthiest class instead of those in need of fair wages or products that are affordable,” said Krista Brown, a policy analyst with the American Economic Liberties Project. Media framing likely influences public perception. News reports of Hershey’s multiple price hikes over the last year read like so many dire reports on inflation’s pervasive toll. The company, which owns popular brands like Reese’s, KitKat and Skinny Pop, has been cast as the “latest victim of ever-increasing inflation”. But a closer look at the company’s financials suggests a vastly different reality. Hershey’s net profits spiked 62% between the fourth quarters in 2019 and 2021, its operating margin widened, and it recently rewarded shareholders with $200m in stock buybacks. Still, customers will pay even more for candy bars in 2022 as Hershey aims for even higher profits: “Pricing will be an important lever for us this year and is expected to drive most of our growth,” CEO Michele Buck told investors. Similarly, a Kroger executive told investors in June, “a little bit of inflation is always good for our business”, while Hostess’s CEO in March said rising prices across the economy “helps” it profit. The pandemic, war, supply chain bottlenecks and pricing decisions made in corporate suites have created a “smokescreen”, said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, which tracks companies’ profits. That obscures questionable price increases, she added, and allows businesses to be portrayed as “victims”. “That gray, nebulous area is fertile ground for companies right now, and you hear about it in their earnings calls,” Owens said. “Inflation itself is the opportunity.” The Guardian’s findings are in line with recent US commerce department data that shows corporate profit margins rose 35% during the last year and are at their highest level since 1950. Inflation, meanwhile, rose to 8.5% year over year in March. The Guardian’s analysis is the first to take a granular look at a cross-section of companies across a range of industries. It compared the most recent quarter’s profits to the same quarter two years prior, pre-pandemic. Price increases were obtained by checking earnings reports, though those often lacked specifics. The data is not intended to be definitive, but does show how a wide sample of companies have raised prices even as profits jumped. In earnings call after earnings call, executives made no secret of their strategies. As gas prices soared, Chevron’s 240% profit spike was part of “the best two quarters the company has ever seen”, prompting a dividend increase and assurances it would keep production low to maintain high prices. Steel Dynamics profits increased 809%. The company was “not materially affected by inflation” as higher prices “exceeded” increased supply chain costs. Fertilizer giant Nutrien’s profits shot up by about $1.2bn on “higher selling prices [that] more than offset higher raw material costs and lower sales volume”. Nike’s 53% profit increase driven by higher prices was only “partially offset” by supply chain and inflationary cost increases. Keurig-Dr Pepper’s “significant pricing actions” and productivity outpaced inflationary costs, leading to an 83% profit jump. The analysis found commodity companies trading in oil, timber, rubber, meat, wheat, steel and mining recorded the highest profit increases, while restaurants and retailers saw comparatively lower improvements, or losses. Commodity price spikes reverberate down the supply chain, eventually hitting consumers, noted Martin Schmalz, an Oxford University economist. The Guardian’s data, he added, objectively shows a massive “transfer of wealth” from consumers, who pay higher prices, to shareholders and investment firms that reap the benefits. The potential consequences are enormous and global. Inflation may already have sealed Democrats’ midterm fate, and in France, Marie Le Pen, a far-right candidate from a Holocaust-denying party, gained on her liberal opponent as she positioned herself as the “pricing power” candidate taking on the “oligarchy” and “elitism”. But even as profits skyrocket, many have dismissed the idea they play a meaningful role in inflation, including Larry Summers, a former Obama adviser with clout in the Biden White House. He previously called profiteering claims “business bashing” that are “terrible economics”. A Hershey spokesperson stressed that its growth was driven in part by volume, and it would be re-investing much of its profits to meet growing demand: “These investments are where we are making the biggest use of cash,” he said. Financial observers have varying takes on whether companies are “profiteering” or “price gouging”, or simply profiting. George Pearkes, an analyst at Bespoke Investment, pointed to Caterpillar, which recorded a 958% profit increase driven by volume growth and price realization between 2019 and 2021’s fourth quarters. Eliminating price increases may have dropped the company’s 2021 quarter four operating profits slightly below the $1.3bn it made in 2020. “This isn’t price gouging … and it shows pretty concretely that there’s a lot of nuance here,” Pearkes said, adding profiteering is “not the primary driver of inflation, nor the primary driver of corporate profits”. However, he added that it’s reasonable to question whether Caterpillar should have passed on its cost increases. The company also spent $5bn on buybacks last year, and $1.3bn for a quarter of profits is still high, Brown noted, especially in the context of American workers’ shrinking wages. “Companies have access to massive capital,” she said. “They could have one or two years that are more painful – not even more painful, just less profitable for their investors, and they’re choosing not to.” One industry that neatly illustrates how corporations have used the current imbalance of supply and demand to increase their profits is housing. In recent months, the white-hot market for newly built houses shut out many Americans as average sale prices shot above $500,000. The popular explanation: inflation, supply chain squeezes and building material costs. But another less publicized factor contributed. Two of the nation’s largest builders, PulteGroup and Lennar, intentionally kept home starts low and took other steps seemingly designed to maintain high prices by restricting supply. “​​We could sell another 1,000 homes in the quarter if we wanted to without too much effort. It just doesn’t make sense to do that,” Lennar co-CEO Jon Jaffe told investors in an earnings call. Lennar’s profits are up 78%, while PulteGroup’s jumped 97%. Lennar didn’t respond to a request for comment. A step up the supply chain, wood producer Boise Cascade saw profits spike more than 1,100%, which it largely attributed to “unprecedented” pricing in 2021. Executives boasted that improved margins were only “offset partially” by inflationary and supply chain costs. And at Home Depot and Lowe’s, where profits are up 38% and by about $2bn, respectively, volume and pricing drove sales as customers paid four times more for lumber. Observers note a common thread along the supply chain: consolidation. By some estimates, Home Depot and Lowe’s control about one-third of the home improvement market, and hold even more of consumer lumber. Lennar and PulteGroup control about 11% of the home building market, though that figure is probably much higher in many metro regions, and Boise Cascade controls about one-third of the plywood market, according to a Forest Economic Advisors analysis. “Those who have market power can raise prices above what’s considered fair market value,” Brown said. “We’re at a point in our market concentrations that we haven’t seen ever before.” The influence of consolidation is pervasive. A Procter & Gamble executive noted to investors it and Kimberly Clark benefit from controlling 70% of the diaper market. It’s what Owens called a “concentration of necessities”. Reports say customers have “shrugged off” diaper cost increases, but antitrust advocates note very limited alternatives exist for many consumers. After multiple price increases, Procter & Gamble’s profits are up and Kimberly Clark’s are down, though the latter expects to “cover the majority of inflation with pricing” in 2022. Similarly, Hershey’s 30 companies control at least 46% of the candy market. Prices on some of its products are probably up by double digits while the CPI index shows candy is up 7.6%. Concentration is particularly pronounced among commodity companies, a problem highlighted in the grain market. CPI data shows bread and cereal prices increased by 30% and 7% between 2019 and 2021’s fourth quarters, while wheat skyrocketed to an all-time high in March as war largely eliminated Ukrainian and Russian crops. Meanwhile, four large grain producers control about 90% of the market. Among them are Archer Daniels Midland, whose profits jumped 55%, and Bunge, whose profits swung by about $280m. Three companies control 73% of the cereal market. That level of concentration breeds higher prices, said Alex Turnbull, a commodities analyst. “When you go from 15 to 10 companies, not much changes,” he said. “When you go from 10 to six, a lot changes. But when you go from six to four – it’s a fix.” Depending on the material or good, some commodity prices are set by exchanges, which Pearkes noted largely eliminates some companies’ pricing power. But commodity consolidation can open the door to another form of pricing power: boosting prices by keeping supply low. “Price is set by supply and demand at some metals exchange, but what is the supply? That is what the companies determine, no?” Schmalz asked. Just as PulteGroup kept housing starts down, oil companies have kept production low while gas topped $7 a gallon in some regions. In earnings calls across the industry, oil executives like Diamondback Energy CEO Travis Stice have promised to keep production flat in the years ahead, “putting returns and, therefore, shareholders first”. “No one wants to see that shareholder return program put at risk with volume growth,” Stice said. Some companies are enacting price increases in a less direct manner: by eliminating lower-cost products. The CEO of Kohl’s said in a previous interview the store was shifting its merchandise toward higher-end brands like PVH-owned Tommy Hilfiger, where profits are up 183%, because they’re more profitable for Kohl’s. Similarly, General Motors profits jumped 49% between the full years in 2019 and 2021 despite selling about a million fewer vehicles. The company said it focused on moving more expensive trucks and SUVs than in previous years, but it also raised prices – a Silverado can now cost over $5,000 more than it did in 2019. That includes two rounds of March price increases just weeks after GM announced record profits and margins. Such strategies further squeeze lower income consumers, said University of Massachusetts Amherst economist Isabella Weber. “That’s a general trend that can enhance price increases quite dramatically, especially with cars and groceries,” she said. Not everyone is raising prices. Arizona Iced Tea owner Dan Vultaggio became a populist hero in April when he declared he’d rather take a hit than push prices above 99 cents: “I don’t want to do what the bread guys and the gas guys and everybody else is doing,” Vultaggio told the Los Angeles Times. But Arizona is a privately owned company that doesn’t face shareholders’ wrath. When Target and Walmart declined to pass all inflationary costs on to customers ahead of the holiday season, an investor revolt ensued, and their shares temporarily plummeted. “Shareholders are not interested in seeing anyone be cautious with price increases, and in some cases they’re saying ‘let’s throttle supply, let’s see how far we can take this’,” Owens said. The surge in pandemic profits has not gone unnoticed. A spate of Senate and House bills aim to rein in excessive profits, while Biden proposals and executive actions target stock buybacks and consolidation. Meanwhile, many consumer advocates and economists argue that enforcing antitrust laws already on the book, or strengthening them, could help reduce companies’ pricing power. Others have argued for the implementation of very targeted price controls on essential items, like bread. In March, Senator Bernie Sanders began a push to bring back a windfall profit tax last used after the second world war, while Senator Elizabeth Warren introduced similar legislation that focused on oil companies’ profits. “The American people are sick and tired of the unprecedented corporate greed that exists all over this country. They are sick and tired of being ripped off by corporations making record-breaking profits while working families are forced to pay outrageously high prices for gas, rent, food, and prescription drugs,” said Sanders. Sanders may well be right, but if “sick and tired” Americans vote against the Biden administration in November, his chances of pushing for change will fall.",News/Business,Revealed: top US corporations raising prices on Americans even as profits surge,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/27/inflation-corporate-america-increased-prices-profits
4/27/2022,"My credit card provider has reduced my credit limit by 98%. When I asked why, they advised me to check my credit reports. It turns out my TransUnion and Equifax details are full of records for someone with the same first name as my own, but the surname Henderson. My name is Anderson. We have different names, different dates of birth and different addresses. It seems we did once live on the same street, but at different numbers and in different years. This stranger seems to have got finance for a BMW, failed to keep up payments and has recently been credit checked by doorstep loan companies and I’m worried that he might also be able to view my personal records. I’m about to exchange on a property and this may mean I lose it.Full name withheld, London This is very disturbing, and not an isolated case, according to the Information Commissioner’s Office. Your mysterious alter ego lives at the other end of the country and is 10 years younger. There would appear to be nothing to link you and, indeed, Henderson does not make an appearance in your records with Experian, the only credit reference agency to which you subscribe. TransUnion didn’t attempt to explain the error and merely apologised for the “inconvenience”. It says: “We have explained that the information has been separated and his credit file corrected.” Equifax blamed a lender for mistakenly submitting an address associated with both you and Henderson. That raises more questions since, although you may have lived on the same street at different times, you’ve never had an address in common. What it does show, is that third-party carelessness, or even a typo, can trash a credit rating with grave repercussions for mortgage applications, insurance, mobile phone contracts and even a job hunt. It took two weeks for your data records to be separated and Equifax says the process can take up to 28 days since the company responsible for submitting the incorrect data has to rectify the error first. A “notice of disassociation” has now been applied to prevent the mismatch recurring. It is, in my opinion, a serious data breach which could have exposed either you, or Henderson, to fraud, but the ICO says it would only investigate if neither the lender who made the initial mistake, or the credit reference agencies, corrected it. Equifax has paid you £350 in compensation. TransUnion is still inching through its complaint-handling process which, it warned, could take up to eight weeks.Email your.problems@observer.co.uk.

4/27/2022,"You have to be careful about letting women into politics, you really do. You give them a few rights and then they start clamouring for more. Worse still, they start using their womanly wiles to get their way, crossing their legs in parliament and distracting great Oxbridge-educated statesmen from their trains of thought. I speak, of course, of Angela Rayner. Labour’s deputy leader was accused by the Mail on Sunday (MoS) last week of a “Basic Instinct ploy to distract Boris” by … moving her legs at work. I was born in London and I have British citizenship, but I moved to the US more than a decade ago. Sometimes (normally when dealing with medical bills), I wonder why on earth I left – and then I read articles such as the one in the MoS and I remember. The US is incredibly flawed, but it is not riddled with the sort of embarrassing, outdated classism that plagues the UK. The MoS’s article on Rayner was full of digs about her being educated at a comprehensive school and quoted one MP as saying: “She knows she can’t compete with Boris’s Oxford Union debating training, but she has other skills which he lacks.” Maybe those skills include being able to understand that we live in the 21st century. While the US is less classist than the UK, it is equally rife with misogyny. It would be nice to think that the outrageous attack on Rayner was a one-off. Alas, female politicians everywhere face similar abuse and condescension. There are three main prongs of attack. First, you are not qualified and you are just a diversity hire. Second, you used your feminine charms to get to the top. Third, you are simply unpleasant. For example, Fox News suggested repeatedly that the US supreme court justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was nominated for the position only because she is black; Kamala Harris, the vice-president, has been accused of sleeping her way to the top; and the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren is routinely described as “unlikable”.

4/27/2022,"Asylum seekers’ accommodation is “unsafe” due to inadequate healthcare, while poor living conditions are exacerbating or creating mental and physical health problems, according to a new report by Doctors of the World. The charity’s research, published on Wednesday, details the barriers to medical care and medication for asylum seekers in initial accommodation across the UK. Evidence gathered by Doctors of the World shows that a failure to meet basic human standards in hotels and former military barracks such as Napier in Folkestone has exacerbated depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health concerns among asylum seekers. Ara* described waking up in a cold sweat every night since he arrived at Napier. Sometimes he’s lying in a tight ball and shaking, terrified that he is back in a prison cell. “It’s always the same: I wake up, I’m screaming, remembering,” he said. “I have bad nightmares. I need pills for sleeping but the GP said to me ‘Go to YouTube, it will tell you how you can sleep.’ I don’t have [a] phone, so how can I see that? I asked for help, but nobody will help me.” For those who have fled torture and imprisonment, as Ara did, the detention-like conditions at Napier camp mean they relive their previous trauma, with many saying their mental health is deteriorating further. “Others in my room [shared with 13 other men], they are waking up,” said Ara. “It’s impossible to sleep. We all need a doctor – we left the war – but there is no one to help us.” Another asylum seeker said he had to wait more than a month for medical attention, despite reporting severe tooth pain, which stopped him eating. “We don’t have a good nurse in the camp,” he said. “I needed immediate help – I couldn’t eat properly, there was so much pain – but they refuse to do [anything]. They said there is no dentist, it will get better on its own.” In several instances, asylum seekers said staff were unhelpful and treated them as if they had lied about their medical conditions. Some of those identified in the report said they were unable to purchase medications, toiletries, clothing or food, while others said the food was not culturally appropriate. Of those interviewed, 43% said they had lost weight because they were unable to eat the food provided, which was not properly cooked or fresh. Another man at Napier camp said he had experienced severe stomach pains from the food at the camp, but had not been referred to a doctor. “I’m so sick, I cannot eat. The nurse, she is never there and no one does [anything].” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We reject these claims. Napier barracks is safe and we treat the welfare of those in our care with the utmost importance and sensitivity.” Asylum seekers supported by the Home Office are entitled to access the NHS low-income scheme for help with health costs, including prescriptions, optometry charges and dental care. However, accommodation providers are not required to directly support access to healthcare or register asylum seekers with a GP unless the person is in “obvious and urgent” need of medical care, such as heavy blood loss, severe chest pain, pregnancy complications or a suicide attempt. In its report published last week, after a visit to Napier barracks in February, the all-party parliamentary group on immigration detention described conditions at Napier as “quasi-detention” and said the barracks were “fundamentally unsuitable for use as asylum accommodation”. An earlier visit by the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration found that most residents had experienced depression and a third had felt suicidal, with people at risk of self-harm placed in decrepit isolation blocks. Despite inspections that demonstrate the unsuitability of accommodation such as Napier, the Home Office recently extended the contract to 2025. In the nationality and borders bill currently going through parliament, the Home Office described the former military barracks as a “prototype” for how reception centres may operate in the future. Under plans by the home secretary, Priti Patel, to change the asylum system, the Home Office says it will develop more large-scale asylum accommodation in remote areas, including the former RAF airbase at Linton-on-Ouse in North Yorkshire. Anna Miller, head of policy and advocacy at Doctors of the World, said: “Sadly, plans to develop new military-style accommodation sites is only one of the many aspects of the nationality and borders bill currently going through parliament which will cause lasting and profound harm to the health and wellbeing of people seeking sanctuary in the UK. “We urge the government to have a full rethink of its plans to reform the asylum system and to prioritise the health and wellbeing of people seeking sanctuary in the UK.” In addition to rejecting the claims, the Home Office said: “There is 24/7 medical support for asylum seekers at Napier barracks, including a prescribing nurse, dental care on site and access to local GP services, which includes mental health support. Individuals at all our immigration removal centres are brought to the attention of medical staff and, once screened, can receive clinical pathways to healthcare services depending on their needs.” * Names have been changed and countries of origin omitted to protect asylum seekers’ identities.",News/Global development,‘Unsafe’ UK accommodation threatens asylum seekers’ health – report,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/27/unsafe-uk-accommodation-threatens-asylum-seeker-health-doctors-of-the-world-report
4/27/2022,"On 5 April, the UK reported an unexpected and significant increase in cases of severe, acute hepatitis of unknown origin in young, previously healthy children, all under the age of 10. Since then, an increase in cases has been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) by 11 other countries including Ireland, the US, Israel, the Netherlands, Romania, and as of Tuesday, Japan. On Wednesday, it was reported Canada is also investigating an undisclosed number of cases to see if they are linked to the outbreak. The children affected range from one month old to 16 years old. One child has died, and about 10% of cases have required a liver transplant, the WHO said. The majority of cases are in the UK (114 cases), with approximately 200 cases reported in total. It is possible the true number may be greater if there are children affected who are not showing serious symptoms and therefore will not have been taken to hospital for testing. Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver, which can lead to a range of health problems including cancer and liver failure, and can be fatal. The liver is crucial as it removes toxins from the blood, is involved in metabolism and regulates blood clotting, among other functions. Hepatitis has a number of causes. The most common are viruses, with hepatitis A, B, C, D and E being the key virus strains involved. These viruses differ in terms of how they are transmitted, their geographical spread, symptoms (not everyone develops symptoms) and severity, but all lead to hepatitis. There are vaccines against some of these virus strains. Alcohol, certain medications and immune system disorders can also cause hepatitis. Sometimes, hepatitis has no known cause, which is what is being seen in the cases in children reported to the WHO. However, such severe cases resulting in liver failure are especially rare in children, so when clinicians in the UK saw a rise in such cases with no cause, they became concerned. This led to the report to the WHO, and other countries becoming alert to the issue. The common hepatitis viruses have not been detected in any of the children affected. Associate Prof Asha Bowen, a clinician at Perth children’s hospital in Australia and an infectious diseases researcher at Telethon Kids Institute said: “This is definitely unusual, and I can’t think of many times in my career where we have faced something like this.” “What’s unusual is that it’s fulminant hepatitis, which basically means the liver has failed completely in these children,” Bowen said. “That’s extremely rare in childhood. And it has put us all on high alert.” The children were generally healthy before becoming sick and being diagnosed. The WHO described their hepatitis as “severe and acute”. Many of the children suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting just before being diagnosed. Many also had jaundice, a condition which can make the skin and eyes appear yellow, and which can be caused by liver damage. A number of investigations are occurring into potential causes of the mystery hepatitis, but nothing has been confirmed. Adenoviruses – which are common and lead to what people describe as a cold, and symptoms such as a sore throat, fever and diarrhoea – were detected in more than 70 of the children. Covid-19 was also detected in 20 cases. But the WHO said in its latest report on the cases that while adenovirus is currently one hypothesis as the underlying cause, “it does not fully explain the severity of the clinical picture”. The strain of adenovirus, known as type 41, seen in many of the children has not previously been linked to severe hepatitis. “While there have been case reports of hepatitis in immunocompromised children with adenovirus infection, adenovirus type 41 is not known to be a cause of hepatitis in otherwise healthy children,” the WHO said. Bowen, who is also co-chair of the Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases, said the adenovirus theory is the most likely explanation so far, but that “whether that’s the absolute causative agent, there’s still a quite a bit of uncertainty about that”. Other investigations are examining whether environmental factors, or other viruses or organisms may be involved. Director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Dr Andrea Ammon, told reporters during a briefing on Tuesday that another hypothesis being investigated is whether lockdowns may have weakened children’s immunity due to lower exposure to pathogens. The WHO said “hypotheses related to side effects from the Covid-19 vaccines are currently not supported” given the majority of affected children did not receive a Covid-19 vaccination, as they were too young. Countries have been urged to be alert to any hepatitis cases in children with no apparent cause. The WHO recommends that blood, urine, stool and respiratory samples, as well as liver biopsy samples, should be taken from these children. “Other infectious and non-infectious causes need to be thoroughly investigated,” the WHO said.",News/Society,What is hepatitis and what do we know about mystery cases in children – explainer,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/27/what-is-hepatitis-outbreak-2022-causes-mystery-cases-in-children-explainer
