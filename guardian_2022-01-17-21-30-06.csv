1/17/2022,"West Ham battled well to claim a 1-1 draw with Tottenham on Sunday night after Hawa Cissoko put her team in the worst possible position. The Hammers were 1-0 down after 54 minutes and Cissoko, who was responsible for the tackle that led to Spurs’ penalty, was sent off two minutes later for a second yellow card. But West Ham managed to claw back a point in the dying moments through a Kate Longhurst header in the 92nd minute. The comeback highlights the team’s progression as last season they could well have sunk being a goal and a player down. But the resilience displayed in the second half shows how far they have come under Olli Harder and the potential they have for the future. Sarah Rendell  Georgia Stanway was in full ‘new year, new me’ mode against Aston Villa with a goal in both the opening and latter stages to secure a 3-0 away win. Stanway’s first was the result of a swashbuckling run through Villa’s midfield, making use of space in front of her to roll in City’s opener in the fifth minute - she made multiple attempts of the move during the match, to varying degrees of success. Villa found it more and more difficult to keep her quiet and it all became too much for Carla Ward’s defence in the 75th minute when Stanway ghosted her way to the far post, tapping in her fifth goal in three games. It’s unarguable that she is in fantastic form, making light work of Villa’s back four. Continue in this vein and Stanway will cement her status as the player leading City back to their best. Maryam Naz Arsenal may have seen their weekend game cancelled because of Covid cases and injuries in opponents Reading’s squad but they have still been busy. The crisis-hit Gunners have collected just one win in five games since the start of December. Last week’s 2-0 loss to relegation battling Birmingham was a particular shock to the system. All is not lost though, Jonas Eidevall’s side remains in all four competitions and sits atop of the WSL table. There will be hope that the arrival of highly-rated Sweden forward Stina Blackstenius from Häcken and the defender Laura Wienroither from Champions League group opponents Hoffenheim will help stop the rot. Perhaps most important, however, is the return of influential centre-back Leah Williamson, who has been out injured since November, and the announcement that she has signed a new contract. Suzanne Wrack Manchester United are believed to have missed out on the chance to recruit Blackstenius much to the frustration of fans. Marc Skinner’s squad is thin and the club are yet to announce any incoming or outgoing players. Yet with four back-to-back wins for the first time this season the current crop are showing signs that they have clicked with the way Skinner wants them to play. Five goals against a Birmingham team that secured a first win of the season against previously unbeaten Arsenal in their previous game is not to be sniffed at. Forward Leah Galton’s stock continues to rise with an assist and two goals in six minutes and United could take the advantage over Tottenham in the race for the third Champions League place should they beat them this weekend.

They now sit in 11th position, with a brief reprieve from the WSL basement spot - but for how long? It’s clear that the lack of goals has been a running theme this season and it could come back to ruffle up their tails. This is a Leicester team that have only netted six times in 11 games – only the 2019-20 Liverpool side had scored fewer at that stage, a despairingly low three. Leicester’s shots on target have also been on the drop under the reign of Lydia Bedford and against Brighton they only managed three. They have won two out of three now but may need to score more to keep Birmingham behind them.

The postponement means the defending champions have not played a competitive match since mid-December and the elongated break could hamper their performances. They are in a prime position to take top spot in the WSL after Arsenal’s loss of form but the Blues have to be clinical and cannot afford to drop any points. If in the first leauge game back, scheduled to be against Brighton on Sunday, they are a little shaky or the cohesion that makes Chelsea so successful is missing – their chances of claiming the title for a third successive season could go up in smoke. Maybe their Continental Cup quarter-final against West Ham on Wednesday will get them up and running again.

1/17/2022,"Asurvey has found that one in four doctors in the NHS are so tired that their ability to treat patients has become impaired. Here doctors reveal how tiredness, fatigue and sleep deprivation are affecting their ability to provide the best care for patients in the NHS.  As a GP trainee working in A&E last year I made an error at the end of a long shift. Due to staff sickness I was nine hours into what should have been an eight-hour shift during which time I had not taken a toilet break, eaten or drank. When I asked about a break I was told that no one else was taking breaks, but it was ‘up to me’ if I really needed to. I felt I couldn’t. I saw a patient and took their medical history, which included them telling me they were allergic to penicillin. I documented this within the notes but did not add it to the allergy box or the drug chart as I was interrupted by a nursing colleague who asked me to assist with another patient. When I was able to return to the patient, I explained they would need to be admitted and we would start intravenous antibiotics. I prescribed IV amoxicillin and shortly after it was given, I was called to the patient as they had collapsed. I realised as soon as I saw the patient the error I had made. Thankfully they recovered with treatment. I later explained what had happened and apologised to them. The patient was understanding of my error but I still haven’t forgiven myself. I am always so careful but it was the perfect storm of chronic fatigue, thirst, hunger, bladder discomfort, distraction and an unmanageable workload that contributed to my mistake on that day. My sleep deprivation was affecting my daily work and I didn’t realise it until a near miss happened. I’m now off the on-call rota on health grounds. There’s simply not enough proactive management around the effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive errors in healthcare – a situation made worse by the pandemic and short staffing. Breaks should be longer and more frequent than daytime working. The truth is sleep deprivation is a systems failure and should be addressed by health and safety laws. There is no capacity in the system to do anything about feeling tired or burnt out and managers have no solutions and therefore do not want to hear. I have been made to feel guilty for taking annual leave with my family. I work as a consultant radiologist in a district general hospital. I have suffered a severe case of burnout and was off work for over a year and consequently no longer do on-calls. It is now so busy that it is normal to have to report 50-plus emergency scans in 12 hours, with constant interruptions. This is mentally very exacting. The scans contain hundreds of images which have to be manipulated by powerful computers in order to aid interpretation. At the end of 12 hours staring at a computer continuously, your mind is tired and you don’t look at the scan with quite the same acumen as you did at the start of the day. We try to compensate for this by taking longer to do a report and reviewing tricky scans the next day but it is hard and there are many distractions and interruptions that break concentration. What can be done to combat this? Personal experience has taught me the value of building in several natural breaks to my day. Self-care is vital. We take it in turns to buy coffee for colleagues to allow a bit of social interaction.",News/Society,Sleep deprived NHS doctors: ‘I realised my error when the patient collapsed’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/17/sleep-deprived-nhs-doctors-realised-my-error-when-patient-collapsed
1/17/2022,"One in four doctors in the NHS are so tired that their ability to treat patients has become impaired, according to the first survey to reveal the impact of sleep deprivation on medics during the coronavirus pandemic. Growing workloads, longer hours and widespread staff shortages are causing extreme tiredness among medics, leading to memory problems and difficulty concentrating, according to the report by the Medical Defence Union (MDU), which provides legal support to about 200,000 doctors, nurses, dentists and other healthcare workers.  The survey of more than 500 doctors across the UK, carried out within the past month and seen by the Guardian, uncovered almost 40 near misses as a direct result of exhaustion. In at least seven cases, patients actually sustained harm. Despite encouraging signs the Omicron wave may be fading, doctors admitted the constant pressure of the past 22 months spent fighting coronavirus on the frontline was taking a toll on their technical skills and even their ability to make what should be straightforward medical decisions. Medics admitted for the first time sleep deprivation was causing real harm to patients in the NHS. Almost six in 10 doctors (59%) reported their sleep patterns had worsened during the pandemic. More than a quarter (26%) of medics admitted being so tired that their ability to treat patients was “impaired”. Of these, one in six (18%) said a patient was harmed or a near miss occurred as a result. One described how their patient collapsed after being prescribed penicillin, something they had previously told the same doctor they were allergic to. The doctor blamed a “perfect storm” of “chronic fatigue” and “an unmanageable workload”. Another said widespread staff shortages meant “mistakes are more frequent by the end of the day”. “Doctors and their healthcare colleagues are running on empty,” said Dr Matthew Lee, the chief executive of the MDU. “Our members have come through a period of immense pressure caused by the pandemic and it is affecting all aspects of their life, including sleep patterns.” Fatigue increased the risk of mistakes and harm to patients’ and doctors’ health, he said. “In our survey, side-effects doctors reported due to sleep deprivation included poor concentration (64%), decision-making difficulties (40%), mood swings, (37%) and mental health problems (30%).” The MDU survey of medics within the last month had 532 respondents including hospital doctors, GPs, consultants, specialists and junior doctors. Nearly one in 10 (9%) medics said they felt sleep deprived at work on a daily basis. A further 28% reported feeling sleep deprived every week. More than one in six (17%) said sleep deprivation was affecting their technical abilities when caring for patients. Dr Michael Farquhar, a consultant in sleep medicine at Evelina London children’s hospital, part of Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS foundation trust, said that while fatigue among NHS staff had been a concern for some time, the pandemic had “exacerbated” the problem, to the point where it had become a “critical” issue, impacting patient safety and staff wellbeing. “Even before the pandemic hit, fatigue was a huge issue in an NHS which is acknowledged to have been under-resourced over the last decade,” he said. “Dealing with the impact of Covid has exacerbated significant issues which already existed, with many healthcare professionals ‘running on fumes’. “When doctors are sleep deprived they can lose insight, meaning they can persevere when doing the wrong thing. Clinicians are more likely to make errors in simple repetitive tasks, such as calculating medication, and our ability to process, retain and analyse information suffers, too, which means it can take longer to assess a patient’s symptoms and reach a diagnosis. “Fatigue has been a major issue in the NHS for a long time … and with staff now further exhausted by two years of the pandemic, it is a critical issue for both staff wellbeing and patient safety.” In total, 92% of the medics surveyed worked more additional hours than they were rostered or contracted to do, with more than half (52%) doing between five and 20 extra hours a week on average. Nearly one in three (29%) said they got no breaks during a working day. “Doctors should recognise when they need to take a break but equally, they need to be working in an adequately resourced environment in order to take one,” said Lee. “In our survey, three in 10 doctors got no breaks at all during the working day despite many working long shifts. In addition, 21% didn’t have anywhere to go such as a staff room, or quiet area, to take a break.” The MDU said the government and NHS organisations must do more to ensure there were adequate resources in place to allow doctors to take regular breaks. Lee added: “Taking regular breaks is vital in the interests of doctors and their patients. Pressures on frontline healthcare workers are likely to get worse for doctors in the coming weeks. At a time of considerable staff absence in the NHS it is more important than ever that those staff who are fit to work are properly supported so they can care for patients safely.” Last week, after a survey by the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) found that one in five doctors felt overwhelmed by work on a daily basis, Danny Mortimer, the chief executive of NHS Employers and deputy chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: “Staff shortages and an exhausted workforce present the greatest challenge to the recovery of our NHS and the return of safe, high-quality health services for all.” The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.",News/Society,"One in four NHS doctors tired to the point of impairment, survey finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/17/nhs-doctors-tired-impairment-sleep-deprived-survey
1/17/2022,"The Scottish government is in line for a windfall of almost £700m after the largest ever auction of the country’s seabed plots attracted bids from big oil and renewable energy companies hoping to build next generation windfarms. Crown Estate Scotland will grant permission for oil companies including BP and Shell, renewable energy veterans Scottish Power and SSE, to lease the Scottish seabed to build enough windfarms to power the equivalent of 23m UK homes a year.  The auction awarded seabed permits to 17 windfarm projects, out of more than 70 bidders, which will lay the foundation for companies to develop new wind power farms two-and-a-half times the size of the UK’s existing offshore wind fleet, and equal to Europe’s current combined capacity. Simon Hodge, the chief executive of Crown Estate Scotland, said the results were “a fantastic vote of confidence” in Scotland’s energy industry, which will deliver almost £700m “straight into the public finances and billions of pounds’ worth of supply chain commitments”. The winning bidders have also promised to invest about £1bn in sourcing materials and services from Scottish supply chain companies for every 1GW of offshore wind capacity built, which could put local firms in line for £25bn of investment. Crown Estate Scotland manages the Queen’s property, but unlike the crown estate – which manages property in the rest of the UK – it does not return its profits to the Treasury or the Queen. Instead, the revenues are handed to the Scottish Consolidated Fund, which in turn finances the Scottish government. Scottish Power, which is owned by Spanish energy conglomerate Iberdrola, emerged as the auction’s single largest winner after scooping up seabed rights to develop up to 7GW of offshore wind capacity alongside its partners or enough to power 8.5m UK homes. The company plans to develop two large-scale floating projects in partnership with Shell, a 3GW windfarm off the north-east coast of Scotland and another 2GW project off the east coast, as well as its own 2GW fixed offshore windfarm off the coast of Islay. Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, said the latest auction would drive new investment in the energy industry and its supply chain “particularly in areas like the north-east” which could open up “immense opportunities for businesses and institutions across the country”. More than half of the winning bids came from developers hoping to build floating offshore windfarms, which can be located further from the coast line and capture the power of faster offshore wind speeds. SSE Renewables plans to partner with Japanese conglomerate Marubeni and Danish fund manager Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) to develop one of the world’s largest floating offshore windfarms off the east coast of Scotland. Bernard Looney, the chief executive of BP, which won with a bid for a fixed offshore windfarm, said the company would build on its “proud 100-year history in Scotland” by developing its 2.9GW project 60km off the coast of Aberdeen. The windfarm, to be build in partnership with the German energy company EnBW, will generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of more than 3m homes. Melanie Onn, the deputy chief executive of RenewableUK, said the auction would be “a massive economic boost for the whole country at just the right time”. “These projects will attract billions of pounds from private investors, which will create thousands of skilled jobs and allow us to maximise supply chain opportunities all around the UK,” she said. “It’s highly significant that 60% of the new capacity announced today is for floating offshore wind projects. This will secure the UK’s lead in innovative floating wind, generating enormous amounts of power from the best wind resources in Europe, as well as creating opportunities for us to export our cutting-edge technology worldwide,” Onn added.",News/Business,Scottish government in line for near-£700m payday after windfarm auction,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/17/scottish-government-windfarm-auction-scottish-power-shell-bp-sse
1/17/2022,"Firouzeh Khosrovani’s autobiographical documentary opens in a grand yet sparely decorated drawing room, painted in white. As an unhurried tracking shot pulls viewers into the strangely still space, a sense of mystery permeates: nearly all the furniture is draped in ivory-coloured cloth. Indeed, the film operates like an act of unveiling. Peering through the hazy gauze of the past, Khosrovani explores her parents’ complex against the shifting tides of Iranian history. On her wedding day, Khosrovani’s mother, Tayi, married with only a photograph of her father, Hossein, present, while he was studying radiology in Switzerland. Having grown up in a religious household in Iran, Tayi was never at ease in Geneva, where she spent the early years of her marriage. When she became pregnant with Firouzeh, she urged a reluctant Hossein to return to Tehran, right on the brink of the Iranian revolution.  Photos, home videos and archival newsreels comprise the bulk of the film’s visual materials, showing how personal and collective memories deeply intertwine. Khosrovani deploys her family archive in a startling way. Instead of a simple slideshow, the camera gazes directly at the photos for an extended period, the slight unsteadiness in each shot mirroring the turbulence that soon seeped into the marriage. With an 18-year age gap between them, the couple had markedly different attitudes to their home country. Moreover, the more secular Hossein treasured western classical music, while Tayi became increasingly devout and conservative as the Iranian regime changed. Still, these changes are observed without judgment, but with a child’s empathetic curiosity about their parents. While the audio re-enactment of Tayi and Hossein’s conversations are occasionally overly narrativised, this is a beautifully crafted work of family history with an especially powerful ending.

1/17/2022,"Chris Silverwood has been given no assurances over his future as England head coach but insists he retains the support of his players despite their Ashes thrashing. The 46-year-old has also become the latest member of the leadership to point the finger at the domestic set-up and warned that whoever is in his place in four years’ time will face the same issues unless the County Championship moves into the height of summer. In the aftermath of a 4-0 defeat that exposed issues in selection and strategy, Silverwood is waiting on a post-series review by Ashley Giles, the director of men’s cricket, to discover if he will lead the set-up in the Caribbean in March. “Nothing yet, no,” he replied when asked if he had been given any assurances. “I accept the job I’m in comes with that level of criticism and uncertainty as well. Until I’m told differently, I’ll start planning for the West Indies. I want to carry on but there are decisions above that [that] will be made as well.  “I’m the head coach of England but I’m also an England fan. I’m passionate about England and love the fact I can get involved and I can help. I want to continue doing this job, I think I can do this job. I’d like to see changes that would help us do the job better.” Speaking at the team hotel in Hobart, Silverwood described the tour as the hardest of his career – either playing or coaching – and acknowledged that his naturally gentle approach with the players may have been a shortcoming. “I’m not a finished article as a coach and I want to get better all the time,” he said. “I’m not afraid to show my teeth, but you sometimes wonder in hindsight whether I should do it more. But then does it make it less effective? I don’t know.” Asked if England’s latest collapse of 10 for 56 suggested a dressing room no longer inspired by its leadership, Silverwood replied: “I believe they’re still playing for us. The comments I’ve had from the dressing room would suggest that as well. I think what we saw was players that are tired. We’ve pushed these guys for too long in [bubble] environments. There are obviously skill elements attached to that as well. “But it was hard to watch. At times, you were thinking: ‘Just get stuck in, show that fight’. But we didn’t. There was no point saying we did, because we clearly didn’t. I would never question the lads’ commitment. They’re as passionate as the rest of us about England cricket. They want to perform. They train hard, they just came up short.” As well as the added complications due to the pandemic, Silverwood bemoaned the truncated preparation period and the loss of Jofra Archer and Olly Stone that left him with just one 90mph fast bowler in Mark Wood. He backed Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad to keep trucking in but, if he is retained, admitted changes elsewhere are almost inevitable. Chiefly among the batting, with Silverwood echoing his captain, Joe Root, in blaming the marginalised County Championship schedule for reducing the amount of spin and rewarding medium-pacers, only to see this flip at international level. With the Hundred dominating peak months, Silverwood believes it is time to play first-class cricket underneath and accept the divergence in formats. He said: “Front-loading and back-loading the County Championship is not helping anyone. The Hundred is here. I’m more concerned with how we get the Championship working in the middle of the summer. If you get that, firstly you’re getting the opportunity to learn how to play long innings, score big runs, put partnerships together. “But more importantly your spinners are going to come into it as well. [Seamers] have got to have that extra bit of zip or pace to get that movement to get the wickets. You look at the Australian bowling attack: the consistency with which they hit a length and make the ball do something is phenomenal “We would like to find some equilibrium between white and red ball if we want to start producing Test cricketers again.

1/17/2022,"A world-first pilot of predictive genetic testing aiming to identify those at high risk of cardiovascular disease is under way in GP surgeries in the north of England. The NHS pilot, called Heart, is offering genetic tests to 1,000 healthy volunteers aged between 45 and 64 years old to give more accurate predictions for their risk of heart disease and stroke.  The pilot could be the first step towards a wider rollout of predictive genetic testing on the NHS to improve screening for those at risk of a range of common diseases including breast and bowel cancer, diabetes and osteoporosis. Prof Sir Peter Donnelly, founder and chief executive officer of Genomics plc, the company that developed the tests, said: “These are people going about their daily lives who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease who are currently invisible to the NHS. We can find these people who are actually at quite high levels of risk but not aware of it.” Genetics is an important risk factor for many common diseases, including heart disease. However, until recently it has been impossible to quantify the genetic component of risk because it is typically spread thinly over thousands of DNA regions. The advent of vast genetic databases has changed this, allowing scientists to develop algorithms that aggregate the contributions of huge numbers of genes into a “polygenic risk score” (PRS) for a given condition. The participants will be recruited from those undergoing routine NHS health check that is offered to people over 40. As part of the check, GPs use an algorithm called QRisk that combines non-genetic factors such as age, blood pressure, smoking history and cholesterol to identify those at risk. Those estimated to have a 10% chance of a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years are advised on lifestyle changes and offered medications such as statins. The pilot will combine the QRisk score with the genetic score to provide a more precise estimate of risk. Research suggests that in 45- to 55-year-old men, the PRS is the single most important risk factor, explaining about the same amount of the risk for heart disease as the combined effect of all the non-genetic risk factors. Overall, about 5% of people aged 45-65 are expected to be above the risk threshold for statins based on PRS and QRisk combined, but not on Qrisk alone. Applied to the number of 45-65-year-olds in England, if these extra individuals were all treated with statins about 9,500 cardiovascular events could be avoided over 10 years. Michael Brennan, 61, who is retired and lives in Darlington, said he had no hesitation in signing up for the pilot. “I’m probably not alone at this time of the year in thinking about health and lifestyle,” he said. He is waiting his results, but said he will be glad to find out either way. “If I know, I’ve got a chance of doing something about it,” he said. However, some have concerns that deploying the tests could lead to “genetic fatalism”, because unlike most other risk factors, genetic ones are not modifiable. There is also continued concern that the tests, which have been largely developed using genetic data from white Europeans, give less accurate results for people from other ethnic backgrounds. Donnelly said that the company had “worked hard” to address this issue that genetic ancestry is factored in when calculating risk scores. However, Prof David Curtis, a geneticist and psychiatrist at University College London, said that it had not been demonstrated that the tests work equally well for those of all backgrounds. “I maintain that this is a test that will work less well in people with minority ancestries and so would be expected to increase inequalities in healthcare,” he said. Prof Ahmet Fuat, chief investigator on the pilot and a GP with a specialist interest in cardiovascular health, said genetic testing could be a “gamechanger” for primary care. “Genomic testing can improve our identification of patients who need extra management, screening or treatment, and better personalise those interventions to them,” he said. “Common diseases like cardiovascular disease place a great deal of demand on our resources and anything that helps us use those more efficiently and effectively is incredibly valuable.”",News/Society,NHS pilots genetic testing to predict risk of heart disease,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/17/nhs-pilots-genetic-testing-to-predict-risk-of-heart-disease
1/17/2022,"Amazon and Visa appear to have agreed an 11th-hour resolution to their bitter dispute after the online retailer told customers they can continue using Visa credit cards on the site. In November, Amazon told customers that from 19 January it would stop accepting payments made with UK-issued Visa credit cards.  At the time, Amazon blamed its decision on “the high fees Visa charges for processing credit card transactions”. Since then the two companies have been engaged in what has been described as a “game of corporate chicken”. However, on Monday morning, Amazon started sending affected customers emails telling them they would be able to continue to use their Visa credit cards to pay for items, and for Amazon Prime. “The expected change regarding the use of Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk will no longer take place on 19 January. We are working closely with Visa on a potential solution that will enable customers to continue using their Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk,” the email stated. “Should we make any changes related to Visa credit cards, we will give you advance notice. Until then, you can continue to use Visa credit cards, debit cards, Mastercard, American Express, and Eurocard as you do today.” Almost 90% of Britons shop at Amazon, and its analysts have estimated Amazon Prime membership in the UK to be about 21 million. Last month, it was claimed that Amazon faced losing nearly £1.4bn from UK shoppers had Visa credit cards been banned from the site. However, Visa too would have lost a huge chunk of revenue as customers would have been forced to use other cards. It now seems that the crisis talks that are thought to have happened over the weekend have borne fruit, and that a holding deal appears to have been put in place, while a longer-term solution is worked on. Had the ban gone ahead, it would have hugely inconvenienced millions of people who use a Visa credit card issued by providers including Barclaycard. Amazon Prime would have lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers as payments lapsed. A Visa spokesperson said: “Amazon customers can continue to use Visa cards on Amazon.co.uk after January 19 while we work closely together to reach an agreement.”",News/Technology,Amazon and Visa end ‘game of corporate chicken’ over UK credit cards,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/17/amazon-and-visa-end-game-of-corporate-chicken-over-uk-credit-cards
1/17/2022,"As the attention in Melbourne Park swiftly shifted from Australia’s legal courts to its tennis courts, the two most successful women’s players over the past few years both took their first steps towards a possible collision in the fourth round of the Australian Open. Naomi Osaka, the defending champion in Melbourne, returned to grand slam competition early in the day by defeating Camila Osorio 6-3, 6-3. The world number one, Ashleigh Barty, followed her later in the day as she picked Lesia Tsurenko apart 6-0, 6-1 to reach the second round.  For Osaka, the opening day of the Australian Open marked another step in her return after a turbulent 2021 season that shifted with her announcement that she would not be participating in press conferences at the French Open as they affected her mental health. It led to a firestorm of criticism from many who don’t even follow tennis, a disproportionate response from the grand slam tournaments and at the US Open she said that she would be taking an indefinite break from tennis due to her mental health. Osaka made her return to competition at a smaller WTA event in Melbourne, where she won three matches and played well enough before withdrawing from the semi-final due to an abdominal injury. Monday’s contest against Osorio, a quick and resourceful 20-year-old from Colombia, showcased the rust that is still to come off. Osaka wobbled slightly in the opening set after leading 5-0, but she otherwise controlled the match until the end. Throughout the week, Osaka openly discussed her time away, which she anticipated would be far longer. She had spent her off-season with friends and family and she was unusually candid with them, digesting emotions she never had time to address during the grind of the tour. Her return was unplanned; she was bored at home one day, she reached for her racquets and, after reconnecting with her team, the Australian Open soon became a possibility. A few days ago, a fan on Instagram suggested that Osaka should play with something to prove in Melbourne. Her answer was a reflection of how her mindset has changed in recent months; she listed some of the critical comments she has heard people say about her, most of which she has since proven wrong, and she concluded that she no longer cares about what people think. “I definitely feel like in [this] point of my career, it’s not like long or anything, but I’ve kind of been weighed down too much trying to prove myself,” she said on Monday. “You guys have seen me through that entire phase. I just want to have fun, first of all. I can’t expect myself to win every match, but I do expect myself to have fun and challenge myself.” After the stress of last season, Osaka has frequently talked about the need to enjoy herself on and off the court. Throughout her match against Osorio there were moments that could have sparked anger or frustration, like a whiffed overhead that led to a run of games against, but she responded with a smile each time. She says she is consciously choosing a more lighthearted approach. “I came back when I wanted to come back,” she said. “I just felt like there are situations where I previously would get upset. But at this point in my life, like, I’m here because I want to be here and because I find that it’s fun for me. Might as well enjoy it while I still can.” Hours later, as the sun began to set on Rod Laver Arena, Barty took to the court for the first time in Melbourne this year. While Osaka is in the midst of finding herself, it should not be forgotten that Barty already went through a similar process when she was far less prominent, takinga break from tennis between 2014 and 2016. Today she is at the height of her powers, having been ranked number one for 105 consecutive weeks and 112 overall, just five weeks shy of Justine Henin’s count. She is the undisputed best player in the world and, more importantly, she now seems extremely comfortable in her skin. Barty’s first round opponent, Tsurenko, entered the main draw through qualifying but she has previously beaten Barty and reached the top 25. Tsurenko is an excellent athlete with a sweet backhand, but her serve is one of the weakest in the game and her forehand can break down under minimal pressure. Thus, Barty spent her time back on one of her favourite courts in the world ruthlessly picking at every weakness in sight. She led 6-0, 5-0 with two match points yet she was still ashen-faced when she failed to convert either point. She finished Tsurenko off in 54 minutes. “I’m right where I am,” she said after being asked about being only 25 years old yet a veteran in the game. “Where I am at the moment is a product of all the experiences that I have had, the hard learnings, the incredible moments, and I am where I am. We just accept that, we enjoy the journey as we go, we try and be really present and enjoy the moment.”",Sport/Sport,Osaka shrugs off expectations and Barty sets tone on day one of Australian Open,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/17/osaka-shrugs-off-expectations-and-barty-sets-tone-on-day-one-of-australian-open-tennis
1/17/2022,"As a music lover, Emily was excited to join her high school choir on a trip to San Francisco from Riverside, California, in 2011. They attended a competition, which went well, but on the journey back she became fed up of sitting with her friends. “They were talking about boys and being a bit annoying,” she laughs. She spotted Cyril sitting on the coach alone and decided to join him. Although they knew each other through the choir, they had never spoken for very long. “He had taken over playing the piano from me and I’d noticed he was better at it, so there was a bit of rivalry,” she admits. “I did think he was cute, though.” They spent the nine-hour return trip talking and bonding over their similar tastes in music. “I knew who Emily was before that, but she wasn’t much more than an acquaintance,” says Cyril. “The bus ride was really a turning point for us.” Emily agrees. “It sounds cheesy, but it feels like that is where we fell in love.”  Although Emily really liked Cyril, she didn’t think there could be a future. While she was from California, he had moved to the area from India when he was 10. His family were in favour of arranged marriages and dating wasn’t culturally acceptable. “I didn’t think we had a chance at building a relationship,” says Emily. Despite her concerns, she knew there was a spark between them. Not long after the bus ride, she found one of Cyril’s favourite pieces of music, Danse Macabre by Camille Saint-Saëns, and printed out the piano arrangement by Franz Liszt to give to him. “We’d been talking about it on the bus,” says Cyril. “But I was still clueless that she liked me at that point.” Towards the end of term, she and Cyril began spending more time together. They were both performing in the school play and rehearsed every afternoon. That was where they shared their first kiss. A few weeks later, Emily asked Cyril to be her boyfriend. “At the time, I thought it was a really huge decision. None of my Indian friends had girlfriends and, from my family’s point of view, it wasn’t really an option,” he says. But he decided he liked her too much to say no. For the first month, they were undercover, only seeing each other at school. “In the end, I told my family, because I didn’t want to keep it a secret,” he says. Initially, they struggled to accept the relationship. “I was introduced as Cyril’s friend for years,” says Emily. The couple went to university in different areas of Riverside – a city of about 320,000 people – but were able to see each other regularly. “I was even able to join his university’s choir, because there were no rules saying I couldn’t,” she says, laughing. In January 2018, Cyril told his family he was going to propose. By that time, they had embraced their relationship and were happy for them. He invited Emily to a nice restaurant and asked the waiter to place the ring in her dessert. “I’d invited friends and family to a restaurant nearby so they could come and celebrate with us afterwards. My grandparents were visiting from India, so it was really nice.” They married in September 2019. Cyril now works in chemical engineering, while Emily studies speech and language pathology. “I love that we’re best friends,” says Emily. “We complete each other’s sentences and we’re on the same wavelength.” As well as their shared passion for music, Cyril enjoys the fact that they both enjoy the same books and restaurants. “We’re always going out to find these little hole-in-the-wall places to eat,” he says. “We’re also both ambitious and passionate and Emily is always kind and understanding.” Although the cultural differences and family opposition was challenging at first, Emily believes it has made them stronger as a couple. “We are still always learning about each other’s cultures,” she says. “We’re proof that it can work really well if you’re open-minded and willing to be patient.” Want to share your story?

1/17/2022,"Day four in Hobart was one of potentially beautiful batting conditions, the sun shining down on the Tasmanian state capital as the ferries pootled in and out of Brooke Street Pier on the shimmering harbour and tourists wandered around Salamanca Square with barely a care in the world.Unfortunately for England’s cricketers the Ashes series was already over, with their surrender of 10 for 56 under lights the previous evening at Bellerive Oval for a 4-0 defeat leaving two days of soul-searching before the flight home. There were a couple of escapees, at least. As promised upon answering the SOS, Sam Billings was jetting off to the Caribbean to play for the Twenty20 team, while Dawid Malan was hastily en route to the UK after missing the birth of his first child due to an unexpected but thankfully complication-free early arrival. The rest, however, were left to chew over the past seven weeks while Australia basked in the afterglow of a job clinically done. There was also an appreciation of England travelling over during a pandemic from the home side too, Marnus Labuschagne making this point on Twitter alongside a nice picture of Mark Wood celebrating his demise in Sydney.  It goes down as the friendliest men’s Ashes in recent times – two likeable captains in Joe Root and Pat Cummins deserve credit for that – but what recriminations follow from an English perspective remain to be seen. There has been much talk of systemic issues with the sport back home. So, too, the draining effects of bubble life. But while these are undoubtedly true, and few expected England to regain the urn when the squad was announced last October, it was hard not to think that a better-run side might have offered a closer contest, rather than simply a whitewash averted through rain and a final day rearguard in Sydney. The shortcomings were myriad and too often self-inflicted. Preparation was minimal and unfortunately ruined by rain on the Gold Coast, but then why did the tour start in Queensland, one of the few states still demanding hard quarantine upon arrival? England held aces during the negotiations but used them all to ensure families could join the tour, only for a good number of those connected to the multi-format players – ie those facing four months away from home due to T20 World Cup – to stay home anyway. Then came the Gabba, where England were bogged down by the past and future at the expense of the present, shouldering arms to two possible advantages by denying Stuart Broad an early sighter at David Warner and batting first (dreadfully) on a green-top. As Robert Craddock, the longstanding and highly-respected doyen of Brisbane’s Courier Mail put it: “Broad is a fighter. You can never recreate things but if England fielded first, it could have been game on. Broad gets a nick [off Warner], the whole vibe of the Ashes is set”. Come Adelaide they then opted to leave out Mark Wood on a pitch his pace might have transcended despite him bowling just 25.3 overs the week before, citing the need to keep him fresh for “later in the series”, and they also dispensed with Jack Leach on a surface that eventually spun. Despite putting so much stock in the pink ball, an attack of five right-arm fast-mediums that looked remarkably similar to the one picked on the same ground four years ago delivered a not-so remarkably similar outcome. Both selections smacked of overthink by Root and the head coach, Chris Silverwood. James Taylor, the head scout who wasn’t on tour, is strangely said to have had an input, too. “It’s a marathon not a sprint” was the oft-said mantra, ignoring the fact there would be no “later in the series” at 2-0 down. And so it proved, Broad again missing out on another seamer’s paradise in Melbourne that saw Australia select a specialist fast-medium in Scott Boland – and what a series he had – before completing a series win inside 12 days. That Wood and Broad, England’s two leading wicket-takers, bowled more overs than any others yet more than half came after the destiny of the urn was settled said plenty. There was also Silverwood’s promise this would be the fittest England team to ever tour Australia only for Ollie Robinson, so skilled and incisive, to look short of international standard here, aborting three spells in three separate Test matches. To hear that one player also successfully pushed back on having a pre-series skin-fold test citing “fat shaming” backed up a wider sense of a soft environment. Other basics – some would call them non-negotiables – went awry, with at least 17 catches of varying difficulty going down, Jos Buttler failing to justify the investment in him behind the stumps and three wickets falling off no-balls. When Silverwood was asked about the first of these after Brisbane, in light of the one-day team not overstepping for two years, he put it down to a “lack of consequence” in Test cricket, just three days after Warner was dropped halfway through a defining 94. In another contrast with Australia, England’s Test fielders also appeared consistently incapable of hitting when shying at the stumps. Behind the scenes there were enough gripes about clarity of selection and communication to players before matches to suggest an issue. Australia also made more of the scant red-ball cricket available, with Scott Boland, Usman Khawaja and Michael Neser all featuring for Australia A against the Lions in Queensland – two of whom went on to make a significant impact in the series – while the supposed supremo, Silverwood, was somehow unable to persuade his performance director, Mo Bobat, to select any of his reserve batters for the shadow fixture. Dom Bess, a spinner unlikely to feature, was the only inclusion from the main squad. That Jonny Bairstow overcame this for the only century on tour was, frankly, remarkable. Jofra Archer was a huge loss, no question, while Ben Stokes’ disappointing displays should be put in the context of his time off this year. And perhaps none of the above would have changed the destiny of the series when England’s batting against the red ball has been so callow and so collapsible for so long. Australia averaged more runs per innings in every position, and in a series that saw Warner, Labuschagne and Steve Smith all kept relatively quiet, a hungry support cast stepped up. Even in the low-scoring dogfight in Melbourne the hosts had seven batters, not all specialists, with the wherewithal to hang in for 50 minutes or more, while England were Lord Flashheart’s 20-minuters all tour, so regularly were they shot down in flames.This has been largely put down to the system that underpins the Test team (and in the case of Tom Harrison, a chief executive who has been in place for seven years). And Root was right to highlight the gulf that needs to be overcome. Yet improvement once beamed to the supposed elite England coaching environment still rarely occurs. Ollie Pope and Haseeb Hameed went backwards, while Zak Crawley has only just hinted at some green shoots of recovery. All of which begs the question as to whether the exact same set-up should remain in place come the Test series in the Caribbean in March. Plenty has been out of England’s control, Australia were superb and pandemic touring is hard. But it’s hard to make a case for something not to change.",Sport/Sport,"Excuses can be made for England’s Ashes shambles, but someone should pay for it | Ali Martin",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/17/england-ashes-series-shambles-australia-cricket
