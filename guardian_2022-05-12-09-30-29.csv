5/12/2022,"Kevin Rudd has launched a personal attack on Peter Dutton, labelling the defence minister an “idiot” for believing hairy-chested commentary about China would improve Australia’s strategic circumstances. The former Australian prime minister also took aim at Beijing, saying that if Chinese officials really wanted a reset in the relationship with Australia he “could not think of a dumber thing to do than what they just did in the Solomons”. Rudd was referring to the fallout from the signing of the security deal between China and Solomon Islands, in a wide-ranging event moderated by the former Liberal foreign minister Julie Bishop in Canberra on Wednesday night. The former Labor prime minister was particularly scathing about Dutton, who took over as defence minister in March last year and has increasingly ramped up public warnings about the security threat posed by Beijing. Dutton said last November it would be “inconceivable” that Australia would not join with the US to defend Taiwan in a future war with China, and has repeatedly said the Chinese Communist party would want Labor to win next week’s election. Rudd said whoever was the government of Australia at present “would have a challenge on their hands, because China has become increasingly assertive and that is because China’s become more powerful”. He argued Australian leaders must pursue “an effective operational strategy for Australia, as opposed to too much volume in our declaratory strategy in dealing with China”. “Often an assumption on the part of certain politicians like the idiot Dutton ... that, the more you shout, and the more hair you stitch on to your chest of a morning, somehow the better your overall strategic circumstances with China and the United States might be,” he said at the Australian National University. “That’s just declaratory bullshit. And it’s directed at an Australian domestic political audience.” Rudd said it would be wrong to assume an effective strategy “equals pulling out the bullhorn, the megaphone every Monday morning, if it’s, you know, 9am blasting it off on the front pages of the Murdoch rag”. Dutton has repeatedly defended his approach, arguing the government must “speak frankly about the challenges which confront our nation and our region” and not “ring-fence” Australians from difficult issues. The defence minister said on Tuesday that China was “on a particular path” and operated “by very different rules”. “The approach is aggressive and we have to be realistic about that,” Dutton told Sky News. “I just stick to the facts.” Wednesday’s event at the ANU was to promote Rudd’s new book on China-US relations, titled The Avoidable War. Rudd warned that China’s long-term strategy of increasing its influence in the Pacific would “not be limited to the Solomons” and whoever won the Australian election would face “a massive challenge” to restore Australia’s credibility in the region. Rudd suggested that the signing of the security deal was at odds with Beijing’s publicly stated desire to overcome tensions in the relationship with Canberra. “If the Chinese system was trying to send a signal to the Australian political system that, post election, whoever wins the election, Labor or Liberal, that they were interested in a reset in the bilateral relationship, I could not think of a dumber thing to do than what they just did in the Solomons,” Rudd said. “This is a really foolish act, in terms of those within the Chinese system who may be looking for the opportunity for a circuit breaker, a reset. “Whoever forms the next government of Australia, let me say this on a bipartisan basis, that [deal] actually alters the game yet again.” Bishop, who was foreign minister from 2013 to 2018 and now is chancellor of the ANU, added that it would be important to see the detail in the final signed agreement between China and Solomon Islands. “I know we’ve seen the draft, but my fear is that China absolutely dominated those negotiations,” Bishop said. “And if we were able to view that agreement, which I understand hasn’t even been to Solomon Islands parliament, we would have a better understanding of China’s intentions, aspirations and likely behaviour in the Pacific.” The ABC and the Australian have reported that China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, is expected to lead a delegation to Solomon Islands and other Pacific island countries this month, possibly before the federal election. Dutton said such a visit would not come “as a surprise to anyone” but was “obviously provocative, particularly during the course of an election campaign”. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, told the National Press Club on Wednesday it was “quite obvious” that China was “starting a process of encircling Australia”. New polling published on Thursday shows Australian voters are evenly divided on whether Labor (35%) or the Coalition (36%) would best manage Australia’s China policy. The report, by the Australia-China Relations Institute (ACRI) and the Centre for Business Intelligence & Data Analytics (BIDA) at UTS, also finds strong public support for increased defence spending. Of 2,000 Australian adults polled across all states and territories from 18 to 30 March, nearly three-quarters (73%) said they saw China as “a security threat to Australia” – six points higher than the result on this question in the 2021 survey. In the event of a military conflict between the United States and China over the status of Taiwan, 56% of respondents agreed “Australia should lend military support to the United States” – an 11-point increase on this question compared with last year – while 20% disagreed. More broadly, however, six in 10 Australians (60%) believe Australia should continue to try to build strong connections and ties and have a strong relationship with China. The polling report says results presenting the Australia-China relationship through “a binary lens” do not match perceptions in the wider community. It says public opinion “remains in a state of flux”.",News/World news,Kevin Rudd attacks ‘idiot’ Peter Dutton over ‘hairy-chested’ comments on China,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/kevin-rudd-attacks-idiot-peter-dutton-over-hairy-chested-comments-on-china
5/12/2022,"Pep Guardiola said Kevin De Bruyne is reaping the rewards of adding a selfish streak to his game after his four-goal haul propelled Manchester City to within touching distance of a fourth Premier League title in five seasons. Guardiola’s side destroyed Wolves 5-1 to restore their three-point advantage over Liverpool with two games to play and the City manager admitted that the marquee signing of Erling Haaland will only help them to increase their goals tally. Raheem Sterling registered City’s fifth six minutes from time and De Bruyne hit the post with a minute to spare. “I’m so disappointed with him because he missed a fifth goal, with [hitting] the post,” Guardiola said, smiling. “I know he is always a guy who is so generous and always has the sense to make an assist but this season I think he has the sense to be prolific and score goals. “He won the game against Chelsea [in January], he scored against [Real] Madrid and he has been decisive scoring goals and at the end this makes the greatest [players]. I’m very pleased for him because of course scoring four goals in the decisive part of the league is so important. “We’ve spoken during the years – ‘You have to arrive to the box, you have to be close to the box and you have to score.’ This season I think was the year that he has done better and better. Hopefully he can continue not just this year but for the rest of his career. “I have the feeling that now he is starting to enjoy goals. Before it was just assists and now I have the feeling it is: ‘I like it when my teammates come to hug me because I scored a goal.’ I think it is good.” De Bruyne scored a 17-minute first‑half hat-trick and added his fourth on the hour. Phil Foden also hit the woodwork late on. The only sour note for City was further defensive injuries, with Rúben Dias, John Stones and Kyle Walker already out for the rest of the season. Guardiola confirmed that both the 37-year-old Fernandinho, who started at centre-back, and Aymeric Laporte, who was replaced by Nathan Aké because of a knee problem, are doubts for the trip to West Ham on Sunday. “We have incredible problems in behind and against [Michail] Antonio, [Jarrod] Bowen and [Manuel] Lanzini and all their mates it will not be easy,” the City manager said. “At the same time it doesn’t matter what happens, we are going to find a solution and of course we’re obviously going there to win the game.” Guardiola said he has been delighted with his side’s emphatic response since they exited the Champions League against Real Madrid. “You always doubt about how they [will] react but we have done it the way we have the last month for five years. We have done it many, many times. My players didn’t change one second and the results are not going to change my opinion about that. The people say it is a tragedy or a big success, but I don’t play this game.” Jürgen Klopp described Haaland, a £51m signing from Borussia Dortmund, as a “beast” and Guardiola said he is looking forward to helping the Norway forward, whose father, Alf-Inge, played for City, to settle in Manchester. “Big congratulations to the club, he is signed for the next years, he is a young talented player, I’m very pleased he decided to come and join us,” Guardiola said. “Next season we are going to work together and hopefully he can settle – help him to settle as soon as possible in terms of Manchester and a house. I am pretty sure he is going to adapt quickly to the way we want to play. It is a decision for the club to make a good sign for the future.” Carlos Cachada – the Wolves first‑team fitness coach who led the players from the sidelines in the absence of the head coach, Bruno Lage, who has coronavirus – conceded the best team won. “I think it was a fair result,” he said. The Portuguese wing-back Chiquinho, who made his first start, said: “It was a very difficult game. We tried everything, but they are a strong team and they’ve proven on the pitch that they are better than us.”",Sport/Football,"Kevin De Bruyne reaping rewards of selfish streak, says Pep Guardiola",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/12/kevin-de-bruyne-reaping-rewards-of-selfish-streak-says-pep-guardiola
5/12/2022,"Sadiq Khan has announced a commission to examine the effectiveness of the UK’s drug laws, with a particular focus on those governing cannabis. The London drugs commission, to be chaired by Lord Charlie Falconer QC, a former lord chancellor and justice secretary, was one of Khan’s manifesto pledges in his re-election bid last year. The mayor of London’s office said a panel of independent experts in criminal justice, public health, politics, community relations and academia will be assembled to consider evidence from around the world on the outcomes of various drug policies. Khan is now on a four-day visit to the US to promote investment in London to support its recovery from the pandemic. The trip has also included a fact-finding mission to Los Angeles to see the impact of the city’s decision to legalise cannabis in 2016. Khan has visited a cannabis dispensary and cultivation facility, met licensed retailers and growers, and spoken with officials from the Los Angeles Police Department and the city’s local government. California legalised the recreational use of cannabis after a public ballot that passed with the approval of 57% of voters, although individual counties and cities can still choose to ban its sale. Supporters said the move would create a market for safe and regulated cannabis while reducing the power of criminal gangs. The law change led to a fall in cannabis-related arrests – from 13,810 in 2016 to 6,065 in 2017 – but critics have pointed out that the illicit market continues to thrive, with up to 90% of all sales still coming from unlicensed sellers. London’s commission will aim to assess the best methods to prevent drug use, the most effective criminal justice responses, and the public health benefits of different approaches. University College London has been appointed to provide research and analysis on the implications of any potential change in policy. The commission will not consider class A drugs. Once it has completed its work, it will make policy recommendations for City Hall, the government, the police, the criminal justice system and public health services. Announcing the commission, Khan said he believed it would help “tackle drug-related crime, protect Londoners’ health and reduce the huge damage that illegal drugs cause to our communities”. He added: “The illegal drugs trade causes huge damage to our society and we need to do more to tackle this epidemic and further the debate around our drugs laws. “That’s why I am here today in LA, to see first-hand the approach they have taken to cannabis.” Falconer said: “I’m honoured to have been appointed chair of the London drugs commission. We need rigorously to identify what is the best approach to reduce harm to our communities. “A national debate is long overdue. We aim to make recommendations to bring about effective and lasting change.” The Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, said that decriminalisation of cannabis offered “historically marginalised communities opportunities for healing, entrepreneurship, and wealth creation” in a growing industry. “Cities have so much to learn from one another, and I applaud mayor Khan’s thoughtful approach as London moves forward,” he said.",News/Society,Sadiq Khan launches commission to examine cannabis legality,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/12/sadiq-khan-launches-commission-to-examine-cannabis-legality
5/12/2022,"British universities are producing a greater depth of world-leading research than previously realised, the results of a large exercise examining the output and real-world impact of 76,000 academics in the UK suggests. The findings of the research excellence framework (REF), looking at work produced from 2014–2021, is based on rating nearly 186,000 pieces of academic research, with the results used to divide up about £2bn in annual government funding. According to experts, the results show that Oxford and University College London are likely to get the largest share of government research grants based on the high proportion of their departments rated as “world leading”. But the overall results showed a small decline in the proportion of top-class research by the “golden triangle” of Cambridge, Oxford and London universities, and showed larger pockets of high-quality research at smaller institutions. The University of Northumbria was one of the biggest winners, with its research output in areas allied to health, such as nursing and engineering, receiving high proportions of top ratings. Andrew Wathey, Northumbria’s vice-chancellor, said his university’s increase from 52nd to 28th in market share of future funding “moves us clearly into territory formerly the preserve of the Russell Group” of universities as a global force in research. “Northumbria is the first modern university to cross the clear blue water that separated the old and the new parts of the sector, and others are following,” Wathey said. The two-year-long peer review found that 41% of research submitted was worthy of a “world leading” rating of four stars, while 43% received three stars as “internationally excellent”. The 2014 REF rated 22% of research as world leading but senior leaders said the increase was the result of improved submissions and changes in how the exercise was run. Reforms since 2014 forced universities to include all academic staff with significant research involvement in their submissions. But it also them gave greater flexibility in how many pieces of research could be submitted for each member, including for staff whose careers had been disrupted during the period. For the 2014 REF, about 52,000 academics submitted 190,000 pieces of work, while in 2021 76,000 staff submitted 185,600 pieces of research, including books and journal papers. David Sweeney, the executive chair of Research England, said the reforms had made it impossible to compare the results. “I think we are seeing that research in the UK continues to be very, very strong, and perhaps a little bit stronger. But this is about a different measure,” he said. Prof Dinah Birch, who chaired the REF’s arts and humanities review panel, said the differences were far-reaching. “This is a different exercise and lining up the REF 2021 results against those of 2014 will be misleading,” she said. Birch said a “dizzying variety” of research was submitted. “Everything from the fiction of Anthony Trollope, to the nature of the particles that make up the substance of the universe, to the identification of new materials for manufacturing innovation,” she said. Rankings calculated by Research Professional News, a specialist publication that tracks funding, found that Oxford’s “market share” of funding was likely to fall from 6.24% in 2014, after the previous REF, to 5.7%. The rankings also showed that Lancaster and Loughborough universities had better results than two members of the Russell Group of research-intensive universities, with Lancaster above Queen’s University Belfast and the London School of Economics. Sarah Richardson, editor of Research Professional News, said the REF outcomes were crucial in giving universities access to longer-term, more flexible streams of “quality-related” funding. “It’s crucial for universities and researchers because it pays for their ongoing costs, like salaries and early-stage seed funding for projects, and it helps them to plan for and invest in research capacity, rather than just financing research project by project,” Richardson said. Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said the REF was a drain on staff time and resources, describing it as “emblematic of a research culture obsessed with arbitrarily designating institutions or departments as winners or losers”.",News/Education,Oxford and UCL tipped to win lion’s share of grants in UK research audit,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/12/oxford-and-ucl-tipped-to-win-lions-share-of-grants-in-uk-research-audit
5/12/2022,"Nurses are judged to make the biggest contribution to society in Britain, ahead of doctors and teachers, a poll of the public has found. YouGov asked a representative sample of 1,805 adults which group from a list of five types of professionals contributed the most to society. Nurses topped the table (chosen by 16%) with doctors and teachers in joint second (12% each). Next came scientists (6%) and engineers (4%). “The public knows that nursing staff go above and beyond in all they do for patients and those in our care,” said Pat Cullen, general secretary and chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), which commissioned the research. “These findings show how much the public revere, admire and value nursing staff.” Nurses’ special place in British esteem is well established. They have topped the pollster Ipsos Mori’s veracity index – an annual survey of which professional groups the public trust most to tell the truth – every year since they were first included in 2016. In the most recent edition last December, 94% of those surveyed said they trusted nurses to be truthful, ahead of librarians (93%), doctors (91%) and teachers (86%). Advertising executives had the lowest trust rating, at just 16%, followed by politicians and government ministers (both 19%). Ruth May, England’s chief nursing officer, said: “It is fantastic to read that the public considers the work nurses do so highly. No doubt their tireless work throughout the pandemic and to this day has had a huge part to play in that.” However, the YouGov survey also found that 70% of Britons think there are too few nurses to give patients proper medical care. The most recent NHS figures show that the health service in England is short of almost 40,000 nurses. Miriam Deakin, the director of policy and strategy at the hospitals body NHS Providers, said: “Workforce shortages in the NHS are the most pressing concern for trust leaders and colleagues across health and care. “We have 110,000 vacancies in trusts alone, high levels of burnout and worrying numbers of staff resigning from the service.” Meanwhile, the four home nations’ chief nursing officers are backing a new campaign called Here for Life, which aims to raise awareness of the roles nurses and midwives perform and the skills they deploy. It is also intended to encourage potential recruits to consider becoming a trainee. “The Here for Life campaign is about highlighting that careers in nursing and midwifery are highly skilled and require a combination of professionalism, commitment, knowledge, competence and compassion. “We hope that future generations of nurses and midwives will be inspired by these stories and make the choice to join the professions,” said Prof Jane Cummings, the chair of the RCN Foundation, which is running the initiative.",News/Society,Nurses top UK poll on who makes biggest contribution to society,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/12/nurses-top-uk-poll-on-who-makes-biggest-contribution-to-society
5/12/2022,"People working in entertainment and performing arts are twice as likely to experience depression as the general population, according to a review of more than 100 academic studies. The impact of Covid restrictions on theatres and other venues in 2020 and 2021 had exacerbated contributory factors such as job insecurity and low pay, said the actors’ union, Equity, which commissioned the review. Antisocial working hours, time away from home and lack of support from people in positions of authority also fuelled anxiety and depression. The review, carried out by Dr Lucie Clements, examined 111 academic studies relating to mental health in professionals and students in the performing arts sector over the past 20 years. Two studies, one focusing on actors and another on ballet dancers, showed depression to be twice as likely in performers than in the general population. Other papers found that 24% of ballet dancers reported experiencing anxiety, along with 32% of opera singers, 52% of acting students, 60% of actors and 90% of rock musicians. Among the general population, 6% of individuals are thought to experience anxiety in any given week. More than seven out of 10 workers in the sector are freelance, with irregular hours of employment, coupled with an expectation to be flexible and available when work does arise, according to the review. Antisocial working hours and late-night performances may lead to disruption to sleep or inconsistent sleep routines – a known risk factor for mental health problems. “The inconsistency of touring and pressures of time travelling, erratic working schedules (including evenings and weekend performance) and chunks of time working away mean a lack of time for loved ones, family or social life,” says the review. “Musicians, for example, spoke of going months without seeing their children. This is important since support from loved ones is known to be one of the most significant protective factors for mental health.” According to one study, 83% of actors said financial stress was an issue at least “sometimes”, with 30% experiencing financial stress as a constant issue. Many performers juggle multiple jobs to make ends meet. As well as employment-related issues, the review found that the impact of portraying intense emotions and repeatedly depicting extreme situations such as death or rape can contribute to poor mental health. Worries about how an individual’s performance would be received by others was also a contributory factor. Another was pressure to conform to aesthetic ideals, “such as for female actors and dancers to be slender …. Weight pressures and eating disorder risk were directly related to both depression and anxiety in dancers … [and] anxiety, depression, and stress were all correlated with disordered eating in musicians, including vocalists.” Paul Fleming, Equity’s general secretary, said: “This landmark study confirms in concrete terms what Equity members have known for years: those working in the entertainment and performing arts industries are likely to experience poor mental health. There are a range of contributing factors, but it’s abundantly clear that the harmful impacts of precarious work, low pay and poor working conditions are fuelling this collective crisis.” In response to the review’s findings, Equity has launched a mental health charter with five key demands aimed at improving mental health and wellbeing among performers. They include improving pay and work-life balance, adopting safeguards and risk assessments in the workplace and ensuring historically marginalised groups are not excluded from good practice. Equity also calls on the government to invest in mental health services to reverse a decade of underfunding.",News/Society,"People in performing arts twice as likely to have depression, Equity finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/12/performing-arts-depression-equity-covid-job-insecurity
5/12/2022,"We are instructed to meet at a secret Brighton location for this site-specific show by the company dreamthinkspeak. For some of us that invites the usual anxieties: when will we be told of our meeting place? (Four hours beforehand when the e-ticket arrives, in my case.) What is the show about? Why are we asked to register on a website called ARK-22? The whys and what-fors are not immediately answered when we receive an induction into the night’s events, which are inspired by Dostoevsky’s novel The Possessed and are created and directed by Tristan Sharps. We will be travelling in small groups called “cells”, and will receive instructions via little laptops that we wear around our necks. My fellow cell members are Brightonites who have taken part in dreamthinkspeak shows before and tell me it is, in their experience, a “leap into the unknown”. They are right, though there seems to be more guidance than usual because our laptops on this night are glitchy. We do receive some messages from a character called Cyrus (Azaan Symes) who we follow around town. We are told of a family tragedy that led to Cyrus’s initiation into an underground social justice movement called ARK-22 (aha!). It is, he says, an activist group aiming to overturn parliamentary democracy, which he brands elite and self-interested, and to install “direct democracy” instead. Cyrus’s arguments around social inequality are idealistic but compelling, and we find ourselves following him through the city to a meeting house, a pub and into Brighton’s historical centre including the museum and pavilion. We encounter other activists from ARK-22, collect parcels and witness a hostage situation. Sometimes it seems as if we are just traipsing, though the route shows poverty and homelessness in the city as well as Brighton’s heritage and wealth, which we are reminded was built on slavery. Along the way we hear other personal and intensely told stories from activists and these moments are full of drama – more dramatic than the action itself. We also hear the persuasive words of a police officer (Antonia Draper) who informs us of ARK-22’s violence. We must decide whether to be snitches or to side with the actions of ARK-22 in our silence. The experience demands complicity or compliance. In our group we discuss not only direct democracy and the ethics of violent activism but also our jobs and – ironically – house prices in Brighton. There is a final, riveting debate between the leader of ARK-22 and a rich governess (Rachel Heaton). My sympathies for ARK-22 waver when the value of the people’s vote is discussed and the shadow of the European referendum hovers, unspoken. How easily can direct democracy be manipulated or corrupted? But the show’s greater theme of systemic inequality and political abuses of power could not be more relevant now amid poverty in Britain and the aftermath of Partygate. If the action feels weak at times, the issues are potent and linger in the mind. And as much as it is a voyage into the unknown, it returns us to the ills of our society, and those at its margins.

5/12/2022,"Welcome aboard: now beat this. Manchester City knew they were getting a purring, relentless, blond machine of a player who uses strength, speed and guile to breach defences in equal measure before marking the fact with a zen-like pose. They just did not realise Kevin De Bruyne would tick every single one of those boxes on the week Erling Haaland agreed to address their need up front, such as it is. The Belgium international replicated his new colleague’s trademark celebration after burying his third goal and if it was an act of kinship then it was also a reminder that, for all the understandable excitement around their new toy, City want for virtually nothing when De Bruyne is fully plugged in. As De Bruyne stood with arms outstretched and fingers pursed, Phil Foden dashed across the Molineux turf to join in. Foden shook his head, a wry chuckle splashed across his face, and it did not take a professional lip-reader to interpret the comment he directed to someone out of shot. “What is this guy like, eh?” was the gist. It was a reaction matched by those who were merely spectating from the sidelines: disbelief on the one hand; on the other, awareness that nobody should put such feats beyond a footballer who continues raising the bar six weeks before his 31st birthday. The received wisdom is that a perfect hat-trick takes in left foot, right foot and header. Left foot, left foot and left foot fitted that description well enough in the case of De Bruyne’s first three. There was something for everyone: a precise, angled finish across José Sá for the first; an opportunistic capitalisation on the Wolves keeper’s uncertainty for the second; the third rasped into the far corner from range after a surge between two defenders. It is well documented that De Bruyne’s left side is his weaker one, although everything is relative. The story goes that, as a child, he caused so much damage to the garden of a friend’s family when cracking balls here and there with his right foot that he was only allowed to play if he promised to stick to his left. Wolves were left to curse the family’s horticultural pride but they were hardly the first. In the summer De Bruyne scored a similar effort to the last of his strikes here for Belgium, helping them past Denmark. His version of average is most people’s interpretation of the spectacular. “It’s just [a case of] whenever you get the opportunity, don’t hesitate,” De Bruyne said when questioned, beside the Molineux pitch, about his excellence with that less celebrated limb. “I’m never afraid to shoot with the left; even if it doesn’t go in, it creates a problem for the opposition. If you miss you miss, it doesn’t matter, you make mistakes in the game and you go again.” The point about causing problems was fair. When, towards the end of the game, a left-foot strike went slightly off beam it still rapped Sá’s upright. “It should have been five, to be honest,” the errant shooter lamented. His willingness to have a crack only told part of the story. Perhaps more instructive was the fact that two of De Bruyne’s four goals came after he had attempted to set somebody else up. Number two stemmed from a perceptive pass on the turn towards Raheem Sterling, who could not quite connect but was present enough to draw a convenient ricochet off Sá. A right-footed fourth came after he had fed Foden, whose cross towards a poised Sterling was deflected into his path by Rayan Aït-Nouri. “I have the feeling he is enjoying scoring goals, not just making assists,” Pep Guardiola said, and there was something delightful about the fact De Bruyne had been able to capitalise on his own generosity. Selfless yet ruthless: it is a devastating combination and should have yielded at least one assist, Foden hitting the post in the second half after De Bruyne had played him in. Two minutes into the game De Bruyne had swung a delicious, teasing cross inches beyond a sliding Foden. It was an early signal that he was operating close to the point of maximum expression, but hardly even counts as an appetiser. Was this the complete individual performance? It was pretty close, and in one sense capped when De Bruyne was booked in the last quarter-hour for a cynical check on Aït-Nouri. He had committed a similar, unpunished tactical foul on Chiquinho during the first half. Even in producing one of the season’s most memorable displays he had paid heed to the darker arts that play their own smaller, if less important, role in City’s success. De Bruyne’s stock in trade, though, is the sublime. “I didn’t even know,” he claimed of the fact he just happened to have mimicked Haaland’s yogic celebration. “I just did it because I’d scored three.” He is famously as unassuming as they come, but anyone would forgive him a meditation on his own excellence.",Sport/Football,Kevin De Bruyne sets Manchester City standard Erling Haaland must match | Nick Ames,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/11/kevin-de-bruyne-sets-manchester-city-standard-erling-haaland-must-match
5/12/2022,"The US Senate on Wednesday failed to advance legislation that would codify the right to an abortion into federal law, after it was blocked by Republicans. It was a largely symbolic vote by Democrats to mobilize Americans around the issue ahead of a likely supreme court decision striking down the protections enshrined by Roe v Wade. The Senate roll call was a stark reflection of the partisan divide over abortion rights, with all Republicans and one conservative Democrat, Joe Manchin of Virginia, voting against the measure. The final tally was 49-51, well short of the 60 votes necessary to overcome a filibuster in the Senate. “Sadly the Senate failed to stand in defense of a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body,” Kamala Harris, the first woman and woman of color to serve as vice-president, told reporters outside of the Senate chamber, where she presided over the doomed vote. Pointing to the onslaught of laws restricting abortion access in Republican-led states, Harris said that “the priority should be to elect pro-choice leaders at the local, the state and the federal level”. Joe Biden, who has called on the Democratic-controlled Congress to protect abortion rights, blamed Republicans, saying they “have chosen to stand in the way of Americans’ rights to make the most personal decisions about their own bodies, families and lives”. The president vowed to sign any bill that would secure reproductive rights and pledged to explore ways his administration could act in lieu of Congress. Democrats moved quickly to stage the vote after a leak last week of a draft opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito in February and confirmed as authentic, indicated that the court’s conservative majority had privately voted to strike down Roe and subsequent rulings. The extraordinary disclosure ignited protests around the country, pushing reproductive rights to the center of the political debate six months before the congressional midterms. A final ruling from the court is expected this summer. Ahead of the vote, a group of House Democratic women marched across the Capitol to protest against the end of Roe, chanting: “My body, my decision.” Democrats, under intensifying pressure to act, saw a political opportunity in forcing Republicans to vote against a bill protecting abortion at a moment when the threat to access is urgent and polls show a majority of Americans want the procedure to remain legal in all or some cases. They hope to use the Republican blockade as a data point in their midterm message to voters: that the GOP has become a party of “ultra-Maga” extremists, on the cusp of fulfilling a decades-long goal to strip women of their reproductive rights. It is an issue Democrats hope will energize young voters disenchanted by the Biden administration and persuade Republican-leaning suburban women to back them again this cycle. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, urging support for the measure, warned that a failure to protect abortion access would put at risk other individual rights like contraception and same-sex marriage. “If we do not take a stand now to protect a woman’s right to choose, then mark my words, it will be open season, open season on our God-given freedoms,” Schumer said in a floor speech ahead of a vote that he called “one of the most consequential we will take in decades”. If passed, the bill would have codified Roe v Wade into federal law, ensuring the right of healthcare providers to perform abortions and the right of patients to receive them. But it would also go further, in some cases invalidating state-level restrictions on abortion access enacted after the Roe decision in 1973. As such, Republicans cast the bill as a “radical” attempt to expand reproductive rights that goes far beyond Roe and would legalize “abortion on demand”. “We will stand with the American people, stand with innocent life, and block the Democrats’ extreme bill,” the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, said on Wednesday. Republicans are betting the economy will take precedence over abortion this November. Polling shows Republicans are well positioned to make significant gains in the midterm elections, buoyed by historical headwinds, discontent with the party in power and widespread concern over the rising cost of gas, food and rent. But there are signs that Republicans do worry about a potential political backlash if Roe is overturned and states move swiftly to outlaw abortion, as many are preparing to do. A day ahead of the vote, McConnell, who effectively secured a conservative super-majority on the supreme court, sought to downplay calls for a nationwide ban on abortion if they take control of the chamber in November, telling reporters: “Historically, there have been abortion votes on the floor of the Senate. None of them have achieved 60 votes.” The two Senate Republicans who support abortion rights, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, opposed the bill, instead urging support for an alternative measure that they say is tailored to reflect the landscape of abortion rights. But many Democrats see their proposal, which is not expected to receive a vote, as too weak. “Unlike some far-left activists, Senator Murkowski and I want the law today to be the law tomorrow,” Collins said on Wednesday, objecting to the lack of protections for religious exemptions in the Democrats’ bill. In a dramatic shift, one of the only other Democrats in Congress with conservative views on abortion rights, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, said he would support the measure and voted in favor of advancing it. In a statement citing the leaked supreme court ruling, Casey said the “circumstances around the entire debate on abortion” had changed since the last time the Senate voted on the measure. Abortion is also likely to be a major issue in races for governor and state offices, as the battle lines shift to the states, where Democrats are racing to secure and expand abortion access and Republicans are working to limit, or in some cases, outlaw it. The show vote on Wednesday only intensified calls from progressives for Democrats to eliminate the filibuster or carve out an exception for abortion rights. But at this point, there are not 60 votes to codify Roe, and there is not enough Democratic support to eliminate or amend the Senate filibuster. Without a clear legislative path forward, Democrats are turning to the fall elections, urging Americans to elect them as the “last lines of defense” against the end of Roe. “I am angry and I’m disappointed,” Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington and a long-time advocate of reproductive rights, said after Wednesday’s vote. She urged Americans concerned over the threat to abortion to not lose hope. “Now is not the time to back down or sit down,” she said. “Now is the time to lift up our voices and fight back. And that’s exactly what we’re going to do.”",News/US news,Democrats lose Senate vote to codify abortion rights into federal law,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/11/senate-abortion-rights-bill-vote
5/12/2022,"Hundreds of organisations, including drug companies, private healthcare providers and universities, have breached patient data sharing agreements but not had their access to patient data withdrawn, a report reveals. “High risk” breaches were revealed to have occurred at healthcare groups, pharmaceutical giants and educational institutions including Virgin Care, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Imperial College London, during audits by NHS Digital, according to an investigation by the British Medical Journal (BMJ). This means these organisations were handling information outside the remit agreed in data contracts and may be failing to protect confidentiality, the journal said. In one instance, local NHS commissioners allowed sensitive, identifiable patient data to be released to Virgin Care without permission from NHS Digital. When auditors tried to get access to Virgin Care to check their compliance, they were denied access for several weeks and the company refused to delete the patient data, the BMJ reported. Records about mental health, including children and young people, those with learning disabilities, diagnostic imaging and other confidential patient data was being processed outside the scope of objectives agreed with NHS Digital, at an address that had not been agreed, and without a data sharing contract. A spokesperson for Virgin Care said it had “robust data protection in place”. “It is outrageous that private companies and university research teams are failing to comply,” said Kingsley Manning, the former chair of NHS Digital. “How is it that these organisations can be so lax with data?” The BMJ’s analysis of NHS Digital audits found that in the past year 33 organisations were audited and each one had breached data sharing agreements. Hundreds more have been found in breach since audits began in 2015. GSK was found to be at high risk regarding “compliance, duty of care, confidentiality, and integrity” by NHS Digital’s auditors in December 2021. It had breached the terms of its data sharing agreement with NHS Digital in 10 ways, including allowing four unauthorised GSK data analysts in North America to access the patient data. GSK also processed and stored NHS patient data in locations that had not been declared, according to the BMJ. A GSK spokesperson told the Guardian the company had “worked hard” to ensure “all of their recent audit findings have been fully addressed”, adding: “This is reflected by NHS Digital’s decision to reassess GSK’s risk rating as ‘low’.” A health research unit at Imperial College London was also deemed high risk in August 2021. Identifiable, sensitive patient data was not encrypted while in transit between the primary datacentre and the back-up site. Two doctoral students were also given unauthorised access to the data supplied by NHS Digital, the BMJ reported. Imperial College London said it “fully accepted” the findings of this audit and had “quickly put in place an action plan to tackle the matters raised”. None of the organisations had their access to NHS Digital’s data curtailed in light of the breaches. NHS Digital said it was working with the organisations to rectify problems. “These breaches will damage public trust that data is being handled safely and securely,” said Natalie Banner, the former lead for the Understanding Patient Data initiative hosted by Wellcome. “The current system is failing to protect data adequately and a major policy shift and investment is needed.” Phil Booth, coordinator of campaigning group medConfidential, called for real consequences if companies, commissioners and research teams breach their agreements, warning that breaches of data sharing contracts would otherwise be meaningless. He said: “These contractual requirements aren’t just for fun: a single data breach could include sensitive information about millions of patients.”",News/Society,"Hundreds of organisations breached patient data rules, reveals BMJ",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/11/hundreds-of-organisations-breached-patient-data-rules-reveals-bmj
5/12/2022,"More than half of people hospitalised with Covid-19 still have at least one symptom two years after they were first infected, according to the longest follow-up study of its kind. While physical and mental health generally improve over time, the analysis suggests that coronavirus patients discharged from hospital still tend to experience poorer health and quality of life than the general population. The research was published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine. “Our findings indicate that for a certain proportion of hospitalised Covid-19 survivors, while they may have cleared the initial infection, more than two years is needed to recover fully,” said the lead author, Prof Bin Cao, of the in China. Until now, the long-term health effects of Covid-19 have remained largely unknown, as the longest follow-up studies to date have spanned about a year. The absence of pre-Covid-19 health status data and comparisons with the general population in most studies also made it difficult to determine how well patients with Covid-19 have recovered. For the new study, researchers sought to analyse the long-term health outcomes of hospitalised Covid-19 survivors, as well as specific health impacts of long Covid. They evaluated the health of 1,192 participants with acute Covid-19 treated at Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan, China, between 7 January and 29 May 2020, at six months, 12 months and two years. The average age was 57 at discharge. Assessments involved a six-minute walking test, laboratory tests, and questionnaires on symptoms, mental health, health-related quality of life, whether they had returned to work and healthcare use after discharge. Health outcomes at two years were determined using an age, sex and comorbidities-matched control group of people in the general population with no history of Covid-19 infection. Six months after initially falling ill, 68% of the patients reported at least one long Covid symptom. Two years after infection, more than half – 55% – still reported symptoms. Fatigue or muscle weakness were those most often reported. Regardless of the severity of their initial illness, two years later, one in 10 patients – 11% – had not returned to work. Two years after initially falling ill, the patients were in poorer health than the general population, with 31% reporting fatigue or muscle weakness and 31% reporting sleep difficulties. The proportion of non-Covid-19 participants reporting these symptoms was 5% and 14% respectively. The Covid-19 patients were also more likely to report a number of other symptoms including joint pain, palpitations, dizziness and headaches. In quality of life questionnaires, Covid-19 survivors also more often reported pain or discomfort and anxiety or depression than non-Covid-19 participants. The authors acknowledged limitations to their study. Being a single-centre study from early in the pandemic, the findings may not directly extend to the long-term health outcomes of patients infected with subsequent variants, the Lancet Respiratory Medicine said. Like most Covid-19 follow-up studies, there is also the potential for information bias when analysing self-reported health outcomes. “Ongoing follow-up of Covid-19 survivors, particularly those with symptoms of long Covid, is essential to understand the longer course of the illness, as is further exploration of the benefits of rehabilitation programmes for recovery,” said Cao. “There is a clear need to provide continued support to a significant proportion of people who’ve had Covid-19, and to understand how vaccines, emerging treatments and variants affect long-term health outcomes.”",News/World news,"Half of Covid-hospitalised still symptomatic two years on, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/covid-hospitalised-long-symptomatic-two-years-on-wuhan-study
5/12/2022,"An SAS soldier alleged by three newspapers to have murdered a handcuffed Afghan civilian in 2012 has told the federal court he twice refused to be interviewed by the Australian federal police regarding his actions in Afghanistan. The retired soldier, anonymised as Person 11, on Wednesday denied assertions in court from the newspapers’ lawyers that he was lying in his evidence to derail an AFP investigation into possible war crimes. Person 11, who was called as a witness by Ben Roberts-Smith in his defamation case against the newspapers, was questioned in court over the alleged murder of an Afghan farmer, Ali Jan, who was allegedly kicked off a cliff by Roberts-Smith before being dragged into a field and shot by Person 11. Both Roberts-Smith and Person 11 have denied the allegation, saying the man killed was an insurgent spotter who was legitimately killed within the laws of war. Roberts-Smith, a Victoria Cross recipient, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. Under cross-examination on Wednesday, Person 11 agreed the AFP had twice asked him to submit to a formal interview concerning his actions while deployed to Afghanistan. Person 11’s lawyers responded on his behalf to the AFP, saying he “respectfully declines the offer to participate in a record of interview as part of the AFP investigation into his conduct during ADF operations in Afghanistan”. Nicholas Owens SC, acting for the newspapers, put it to Person 11 that he was concerned by the AFP investigation because “there’s a risk that investigation may turn into a prosecution”. Person 11 told the court: “To the best of my knowledge, I’m just aware they wanted to question me, that’s what the statement says. I’m not aware of an AFP investigation.” Owens said Person 11 was “refusing to accept the obvious fact” he was being investigated by the AFP over war crimes allegations. “I respectfully disagree with you Mr Owens,” he said. Person 11 was interviewed three times by the inspector general of the Australian defence force, the court heard on Wednesday. He was excused from a fourth interview on mental health grounds. Owens alleged Person 11 had come to court in the defamation action to give false evidence in order to derail an AFP investigation into possible war crimes. Owens put it to Person 11 he was motivated to lie because if Roberts-Smith won his defamation action the chances of charges being laid against him would be lessened. “That is not true,” Person 11 said. Owens put it to Person 11 he had also come to court to demonstrate loyalty to Roberts-Smith, understanding that if either he or Roberts-Smith testified against the other, it would prove “almost insuperable” to their own cases. “I put to you that you have come here to give a false account of Darwan because you realise that the truth would have very serous adverse consequences for both you and Mr Roberts-Smith?” “That’s not true,” Person 11 replied. “The truth would have the opposite effect. The truth, I hope, will prevail, and it will clear [us].” The court also heard on Wednesday that Person 11’s lawyers had been organised for him by Roberts-Smith. Documents tendered to the court showed Person 11 had accrued more than $125,000 in legal fees, but he said he was unsure who was paying the bill. “I’m not aware of any arrangement about who is picking up the tab. I understand it’s an extensive amount of work,” Person 11 said, but he did not know the details of his legal liabilities. “I have not seen invoices.” Last month, invoices were tendered before the court showing Channel Seven was being billed for Person 11’s legal fees. The court has previously heard the legal bills for some soldiers called as witnesses by Roberts-Smith were being paid for by Channel Seven, a publicly listed company and Roberts-Smith’s employer, until the arrangement was revealed in court, after which Channel Seven requested the fees be paid by Australian Capital Equity, the private company of the Seven chairman Kerry Stokes. The chief operating officer of Australian Capital Equity is James McMahon, a former commanding officer of the SAS. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Owens put it to Person 11 that the fact Roberts-Smith had organised his legal counsel, and for his legal bills to be paid, had indebted him to Roberts-Smith, and that he was prepared to lie to the court for both of their benefits. Person 11 denied this: “There are allegations of [Roberts-Smith] as a war criminal and against me as a war criminal, yes, but we each have our own paths to tread to clear our names.” The alleged murder of Ali Jan is the most notorious allegation of this complex defamation trial – the newspapers allege as part of their defence the murder was a “joint criminal enterprise” between Roberts-Smith and his subordinate, Person 11. Roberts-Smith and Person 11 have both denied the allegation, telling the court they opened fire on the man – an insurgent spotter – after they discovered him hiding in a cornfield and carrying a radio in his hand. Earlier on Wednesday, Person 11 said he had felt hurt that Person 4, formerly one of his closest friends in the SAS regiment and the best man at his wedding, had made allegations he was involved in an unlawful killing in Darwan. “I was aware in 2018 that Person 4 had said certain things which had given rise to these allegations, and I felt incredibly hurt that someone who was so close for a number of years, who had been a mentor and good friend, not just professionally and personally, would say such things that would cause such grief and heartache.” Person 11 said he had severed his friendship with Person 4, but denied he was angry with him. “I pity him, I feel for him. He was a great friend, a great man. I know that he struggles, I understand his struggles.” Person 11 remains in the witness box in the trial before justice Anthony Besanko.",News/Australia news,Ben Roberts-Smith: SAS soldier tells defamation trial he refused to be interviewed by AFP about Afghanistan,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/ben-roberts-smith-sas-soldier-tells-defamation-trial-he-refused-to-be-interviewed-by-afp-about-afghanistan
5/12/2022,"Liz Truss has been warned of a major rebellion over plans for a bill that could revoke parts of the Northern Ireland protocol, amid fresh concern in Washington over the UK’s approach. European Union insiders have warned that the British government’s threat to abandon parts of the Northern Ireland protocol risks undermining the international alliance against Vladimir Putin. Officials in Brussels were “flabbergasted” at the timing of an intervention from the UK foreign secretary, who issued a statement on Tuesday night saying she would “not shy away” from taking unilateral action on the protocol. The bill, which is expected to be discussed by cabinet ministers on Thursday, could be revealed next Tuesday. Doubling down on Truss’s remarks, Michael Gove warned the EU that “no option is off the table”, after the UK argued the solution put forward by Brussels last October would worsen food shortages. According to a report in the Times the attorney general, Suella Braverman, has approved the plans to scrap swathes of the protocol – a move which would grant Boris Johnson a legal green light to move ahead. In her submission, Braverman reportedly cited the Good Friday agreement as having a greater significance than the protocol, but says that it is being undermined by the trade barrier in the Irish Sea and rising civil unrest. Between 30 and 50 Conservative MPs canvassed by colleagues said they had significant doubts about whether they could vote for a bill that would unpick an international treaty. Most dismissed the prospect of the bill’s success and described it as a negotiating tactic. Senior MPs warned there were a number of ministers prepared to resign if faced with passing the bill into law. Sources close to Truss have stressed that no final decision has been made and that any potential legislation is intended to run in parallel with further talks. The Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns, styled under a new title of special representative to the US on the NI protocol, was dispatched to Washington this week to speak to senior US figures about the negotiations. They were reported to have been blindsided by the leak of the proposed bill to the Times earlier this week. Burns arrived in Boston on Monday before travelling to DC for meetings with the Department of State and the senior director at the National Security Council, Amanda Sloat, as well as some senators and representatives from the influential Friends of Ireland group. One source described Burns as being keen to point out his close friendship with Johnson. A White House spokesperson said: “We recognise that there have been challenges over the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol and that talks continue between the UK and EU to resolve these issues. “President Biden has long made clear his strong support for the Belfast/Good Friday agreement. We underscore our continued support for a secure and prosperous Northern Ireland in which all communities have a voice and enjoy the gains of the hard-won peace.” In Westminster, MPs said there was already a strong opposition forming against the principle of the bill, but said most were prepared to stomach difficult negotiating tactics. But they said they expected senior voices to speak out if it went ahead, including one ex-minister who said the former prime minister Theresa May would go further than she had over the internal markets bill which had provoked a number of resignations but was pulled last year. May made a stern intervention on the plans in the House of Commons and MPs described her comments as “opening fire” for more widespread Tory concern. Tobias Ellwood, chair of the defence select committee, said there was widespread concern about the proposed legislation. “Abandoning the protocol is self-defeating. It plays into Sinn Féin’s narrative that a united, peaceful Ireland is better for Northern Ireland,” he told the Guardian. “Binning the protocol will provoke a trade war with the EU at a time when the UK has done so well in leading the European response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It will mean fewer movements of goods and higher inflation.” Most MPs said they would wait to see how much the proposed bill was a device to reignite negotiations. Another MP said there was “huge difference between making preparatory steps as a negotiating tactic which some would understand – and going as far as to whip colleagues to break from an international treaty”. A third said: “As long as it’s posturing, it’s tolerable. If they go through with breaking the protocol, there will be opposition.” Another former minister said they believed Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, had significant concerns about escalatory action by the EU – which has said it could suspend the free trade agreement. “The last thing the Treasury needs is that pressure on supply chains.” EU leaders have also voiced alarm. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign affairs minister, said Truss’s briefing to the press had gone down “really badly” in Europe, warning that unilateral action would potentially plunge the UK into a trade war with the EU. The EU had been expecting UK ministers to ramp up their approach after the public comments from Johnson and Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg about bringing forward “reforms”. Broadly, the threats were seen as sabre-rattling designed to achieve leverage for the UK side ahead of the resumption of talks between Truss and the EU’s Maroš Šefčovič. But relations deteriorated on Wednesday, with Coveney saying the “partnership” that has kept Northern Ireland stable is “absent at the moment”. Speaking on a visit to Sweden, Johnson told BBC News there was no need for major EU retaliation. His spokesperson declined to say if the government had modelled the potential economic cost of a trade war. Talks between the UK and the EU about the protocol are about to resume following a pause for the Northern Ireland elections. If the UK abandoned the protocol, the EU could take legal action and restart previous litigation against the UK that the European Commission paused last July, as well as potentially imposing tariffs on British goods or even suspending the EU-UK free-trade agreement.",News/UK news,Liz Truss’s plan to revoke NI protocol ‘splits allies and risks trade war’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/11/liz-truss-warned-over-bill-to-scrap-parts-of-northern-ireland-protocol
5/12/2022,"Had Celtic appointed Mark Lawwell as head of recruitment 12 months ago, with Rangers in the midst of title celebrations, the cacophony from an irate supporter base would have punctured eardrums. As the son of Celtic’s former and longtime chief executive Peter Lawwell, there would have been guilt by association in the eyes of paying customers. Seeking a 10th title in succession, Celtic had not so much meekly surrendered to their city rivals as imploded. Mark Lawwell was indeed hired by Celtic, days ago and to barely a murmur. Ange Postecoglou endorsed the choice. Postecoglou’s photograph was used in the club media story that confirmed the move. The manager’s status in the eyes of Celtic’s following is such that he could add Ally McCoist to his coaching staff and supporters would find a reason to nod in agreement. Celtic, from such a weak position at the point of Postecoglou’s arrival, are the champions of Scotland once more. Postecoglou can do no wrong. All things Lawwell are pertinent here, with the Celtic regime of recent times deserving to be treated by history far more fairly than was once the case. Dermot Desmond, the principal shareholder, is another who was vilified as Celtic toiled on the field. Desmond’s pursuit of Eddie Howe was ultimately a failure but football has a habit of throwing up unorthodox tales of glory. Celtic hit upon Postecoglou, who has proven the perfect fit. This has been a period of concerted domestic success for Glasgow’s green half, with the Premiership campaign of 2020-21 the clear exception. Rangers will point to their off-field meltdown of 2012 as mitigation for playing clear second-best over a decade. Not only was that scenario not at all of Celtic’s doing, the Ibrox club continued to spend vast sums on player wages while scuttling about in the lower leagues and later seeking to win back the main title. Since Rangers won the 2011 top flight, Celtic have secured 22 major trophies, including the Scottish Cup of the same year. Rangers will cite the claiming of a league flag that matters – no Scottish club has won 10 in a row – but the overall picture serves as a reminder of which club is the country’s dominant force. That should not be taken as a dismissal of Postecoglou, who having arrived from Yokohama F Marinos has transformed the atmosphere around Celtic and flown past a Rangers team not at all weakened after winning the league. This, moreover, amid a Celtic squad rebuild. Postecoglou has been a welcome addition to the scene on umpteen levels. His refusal to berate referees, patronise opposition managers or delve into the kind of small-time soundbites that Old Firm managers can lapse into is to his credit. Postecoglou keeps himself very much to himself, including within Celtic’s training complex, but there are endearing tales of kind acts in the background that paint the Australian in a positive light. In a football sense Postecoglou wants to know what opposition teams are likely to do without giving any hint of altering Celtic’s approach because of this. In time, especially with a Champions League campaign upcoming, this could be portrayed as a lack of versatility that will cost Celtic but for now he presides over a group with complete belief in their coach. Plan A has worked. Thirty-one league games unbeaten – Celtic endured a rocky league start as Postecoglou found his feet – illustrates the momentum that swept Rangers aside. Desmond and the Celtic board have complete faith in Postecoglou’s ability to identify signings, which means substantial summer transfer backing is a near certainty. In Kyogo Furuhashi, Postecoglou has delivered Scotland’s most gifted attacking player. Top-six Premier League teams pondered a move for Matt O’Riley from MK Dons while sceptical over whether the midfielder could make the leap from League One. Celtic’s £1.5m purchase of O’Riley looks certain to pay off by way of a significant profit. Much is made of Celtic’s front‑foot, high-octane play, which can be a joy to watch. Yet there is a steeliness to this team that is widely underplayed. Key moments in this title race include Tony Ralston’s 97th-minute winner at Ross County in mid-December and Celtic’s 2-1 win at Ibrox in early April. On both occasions fortitude won the day. Celtic will celebrate this title in the knowledge of how readily they were written off before a ball was kicked. How little we all knew. The green-and-white grip on the Scottish game is such that excitement and anger over events of a year ago look a little silly now.",Sport/Football,Ange Postecoglou is the perfect fit for Celtic and now has title to prove it | Ewan Murray,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/11/ange-postecoglou-perfect-fit-for-celtic-title
5/12/2022,"Mikel Arteta says Arsenal will go for the three points that would secure Champions League football when they make the short journey to Tottenham on Thursday night, even though a draw would ensure they remain overwhelming favourites to take fourth spot. Arsenal can arguably afford a cagey approach given that, if they restrict Antonio Conte’s team to a draw, they would stay four points in front of Spurs with two games remaining. But the prize that a win would bring is irresistible and Arteta was in no mood to play down the significance when it was put to him that pragmatism could serve Arsenal perfectly well. “We always play to win and that’s the way we will prepare this game,” he said. “I’m sure [Spurs] will try to do the same. That’s why hopefully it’s a really spectacular game. “It’s the opportunity to achieve something we haven’t achieved for many years. It’s the game that will decide it. Normally you don’t play games like that in the league unless you are competing for the trophy but we know that, at our level, what this game can deliver to us is really important.” Arsenal have won their past four games with a patched-up side, sometimes making life difficult for themselves in the process, and Arteta hopes Ben White will be fit to add defensive stability after missing the victories over West Ham and Leeds with a hamstring injury. He also suggested he was waiting on the fitness of Bukayo Saka, who has sustained several knocks recently and came off towards the end of the Leeds game, although it would be a surprise if the winger did not start. Arteta will urge his players to master the intensity of the occasion, which is the first derby to be played in front of fans at Spurs’ new home. “The expectation is huge,” he said. “This is an opportunity for one of the clubs to achieve what we are looking for, and on top of that is the emotion and the passion that the derby brings with it. We need to be away from that and focusing on what we have to do. To win the match we are going to have to be at our very best.” As a player Arteta helped Arsenal over the line to Champions League qualification several times, not least in 2013 when Laurent Koscielny scored a winner against Newcastle on the final day to ensure they pipped Spurs to fourth. That guaranteed Arsenal’s 16th consecutive presence at the top table but, given they have spent five years away from Europe’s biggest competition, he knows this achievement would take on a new significance. “At the time the club was very consistent achieving a Champions League spot so it was almost a must,” he said. “Now the perception is a little bit different because we haven’t been able to do that, so we didn’t have expectations to be where we are. It’s a game that can help us move forwards quicker than expected.”",Sport/Football,Mikel Arteta says Arsenal will go for the jugular in derby against Tottenham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/11/mikel-arteta-arsenal-will-go-for-jugular-north-london-derby-tottenham
5/12/2022,"The Labour MP Stella Creasy has disclosed that she was threatened with gang-rape amid a campaign of sexual harassment after entering student politics at the University of Cambridge. While running for a student council role in the mid-1990s, the Walthamstow MP said she was reprimanded by college authorities instead of action being taken against the men involved. “I’m in my mid-40s now and it’s the first time I’ve really felt even willing to talk about it,” Creasy said in an interview with the broadcaster and former Labour MP Gloria De Piero for GB News. “It was terrifying at the time, I’m terrified I’ll ever run into those young men again.” There have been a slew of revelations about sexism and harassment in Westminster, and up to 56 MPs have been accused of sexual misconduct. But Creasy, a prominent campaigner for women’s rights, including granting mothers the resources to run for parliament, said a culture of “privilege and entitlement” was not unique to parliament but a problem in universities as well. “It’s always the men that people think are least likely to do it who are involved in it,” she said. She said she had experienced sexual harassment “all my life” and she remained terrified of seeing the men who had threatened her at university, who she said had gone on to be doctors, civil servants and “high flyers”. After running into the men several years after the incident, she said, she collapsed to a bar floor and left as soon as she could. Creasy said the abuse would always affect her. She said her first experience of sexual harassment was during her first year at Magdalene College and lasted from 1996 to 1998. She said it included a campaign of abusive posters when she ran for the role of president of the college’s student council. “I’ll never forget the night that I was in a room with them all and they threatened to gang-rape me, let alone the posters that they put up around the college when I had the temerity to stand for a position in the student union, telling people not to vote for me because of who I’d slept with,” she said. “And that happened at a Cambridge college. “I was held up and I was admonished by the college authorities at the time because they chose to believe the idea that I was probably ‘a wronged woman’,” she said. “And, as I say, it took public humiliation, and posters, and finally other people coming forward, and me collating the evidence – of all the notes, the spitting in my room, the rubbish that was thrown at me, the sexual abuse and harassment if I tried to walk into the bar, that came from this group of young men.” Creasy studied psychology at Cambridge from 1996 to 1999, going on to gain a PhD from the London School of Economics. She entered the Commons in 2010. Addressing women with similar experiences, and those in parliament, she said: “You will find allies, you will find those of us prepared to stand with you because we know what it’s like, we know how hard it is and we know the impact it can have on you.” A Cambridge spokesperson said: “We are extremely sorry to hear of the horrific ordeal which Stella Creasy experienced. Sexual harassment of any sort has absolutely no place at the university.

5/12/2022,"Antonio Conte remembers the last north London derby and he was not even the Tottenham manager at the time. “It was a difficult period for my team,” Conte says, and there is no doubt the 3-1 reverse at Arsenal in late September was the nadir. “For sure, at that moment, the confidence was down.” Pierre-Emile Højbjerg shudders at the memory. It was not just the defeat but the manner of it. At times, during a nightmarish first half, it looked as if he was manning the Spurs midfield alone. Arsenal tore through, running in three goals inside 34 minutes. Their dominance was total; the lead unassailable. “It was not good and it hurt a lot,” Højbjerg says. “It’s something that, as a player, you cannot accept. What happened the last time at the Emirates is absolutely a no-go, absolutely something that is not worthy [of us].” For Spurs, the derby is always the game of the season, a reference point, and it is often tempting to plot their progress from one to the next. Back in September, Spurs were only six matches into the Premier League season and the managerial tenure of Nuno Espírito Santo. But everybody knew. It was over for him. Nuno would limp on, although not for long, being sacked at the end of October after the 3-0 home loss to Manchester United. At which point, enter Conte with a brief – in his words – “to try to improve the situation … the club didn’t ask me to go for a place in the Champions League or Europa League”. Spurs were eighth after losing five of their previous seven matches. Not good, as Conte says, and “only a crazy person could imagine that with three games to go we’d be in the race for a Champions League place”. But as Spurs prepare, belatedly, to welcome Arsenal to their stadium on Thursday night, it is precisely where they are. Conte’s record in the league reads: W14 D5 L6 Pts 47 and, when transposed across 38 games, it adds up to a 71.4-point season. He has galvanised the squad. And now comes the reckoning in a showdown that is heavy on juicy plotlines: revenge (as above), huge significance for the future direction of both clubs and, frankly, litres of bad blood. When Spurs last hosted this fixture, it was December 2020, José Mourinho was their manager and a 2-0 win had them on top of the table. It feels like a lifetime ago. There were no fans in attendance because of the pandemic and nor had there been any for the stadium’s first derby in July 2020, which Spurs won 2-1. This will be the first at the venue in front of a crowd and, if the atmosphere promises to be electric, there is also the possibility of it falling horribly flat for Spurs, adding further to the tension. Conte’s team know that in all likelihood they must win if they are to take the fight for a top-four place into the penultimate or final round of fixtures and even then they would be relying on a favour from elsewhere. But if Arsenal were to win, they would secure a Champions League finish at the expense of their neighbours. This is not what the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was built to witness. The game was originally scheduled for 16 January, but Arsenal successfully applied for a postponement as they contended with a selection crisis, although not one related to positive Covid cases. Spurs were fuming and released a spiky statement that got their feelings across with absolute clarity. When Conte reflects on the episode, he continues to use words such as “strange” and “unfair”. Conte does admit that “it is right to play this type of game with all the players available” and says what matters to him are the improvements his own have made since then, tactically and physically. And the bigger picture, too. Winning a derby must be a means to reach a grand target, not an end in itself. “There is a big rivalry [between Spurs and Arsenal], we know it very well, the players know it very well and we want to give satisfaction to our fans,” Conte says. “But when I have played other derbies, with Inter or Juventus, I’ve always said that a derby is one game, or two games, in a season and a big team has to win the derby, not because it’s your rival but because you get three points and they bring you nearer to winning something important. Our mind has to be open for an important target, for winning a derby to be a way to reach this.” Conte can be proud that he has driven his team from a low starting point into contention for a top-four place, a prize he describes as being “like winning a title in another country”. It has come to hinge on a derby like few others and, Conte hopes, nothing like the last one. “I think and I hope to see another type of game because many situations have changed,” Conte says. “We want to show that we are a good team and we can fight for the Champions League.”",Sport/Football,Conte ready to show Arsenal how far Spurs have come since September,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/11/antonio-conte-ready-show-arsenal-how-far-spurs-have-come-since-september-north-london-derby
5/12/2022,"A week on from Manchester City’s painful capitulation in Madrid, the response has been quite magnificent. After Kevin De Bruyne rolled in his and Manchester City’s fourth goal, Pep Guardiola jumped into the arms of his assistant, Rodolfo Borrell. By then Guardiola had already ditched the mammoth black puffer coat, and the gloves have long been off in their pursuit of retaining their Premier League crown. De Bruyne’s peerless performance helped to restore City’s three-point advantage over Liverpool at the top and there are now just two hurdles between them and a fourth league title in five seasons. Raheem Sterling added a fifth goal with six minutes to play but it was De Bruyne, who borrowed Erling Haaland’s meditating celebration as he completed a 17-minute first-half hat-trick, who fuelled this spectacular and unerring rout of Wolves. Technically, City need four points from matches away at West Ham and at home against Aston Villa to get the job done but they effectively have an extra point given their superior goal difference: Liverpool must overturn a seven-goal deficit, as well as City’s three-point buffer, to win the title. Even with Fernandinho and Aymeric Laporte picking up injuries to add to Guardiola’s defensive headaches, it is difficult to see City throwing it away from here. They have scored 22 goals in their five league matches since exiting the FA Cup against Liverpool last month. Imagine how many they might score when Haaland is in the building. At the end of the game De Bruyne trotted over to the referee, Martin Atkinson, to collect the match ball. Given the mood he started in here, flashing a brilliant ball across the box that was a split-second too quick for Phil Foden to convert with barely a minute on the clock, perhaps it should not have been a surprise that he chalked up his first City hat-trick inside 24 minutes, the third quickest from the start of a game in Premier League history. His third was the pick of the bunch. It stemmed from a City throw-in. Joao Cancelo located Sterling, who was challenged by Rayan Ait-Nouri, and when the ball spilled free De Bruyne gleefully took the baton, taking a few purposeful strides and carefully nudging the ball into a shooting position before rattling a curling shot into the bottom corner with what is supposed to be his weaker left foot. Then came the celebration, surely a nod to City’s new superstar. Welcome to Manchester. De Bruyne got things up and running at the end of a typically calculated City attack. Bernardo Silva, who operated through the middle as a false 9, slipped De Bruyne through and he stroked a low finish into the far corner. Guardiola clenched both fists. It was the perfect start but Wolves replied four minutes later when Leander Dendoncker capped a fine counterattack. Raul Jimenez powered forward from halfway before spreading the ball wide. City’s makeshift backline did not cover themselves in glory. The 37-year-old Fernandinho, who partnered Laporte at centre-back, could not prevent Jimenez from finding Pedro Neto and he centred for Dendoncker to coolly finish. It would have made pleasing viewing for Bruno Lage, who, together with his brother and assistant, Luis Nascimento, and Tony Roberts, the goalkeeping coach, was watching on a couple of miles away at Wolves’ training base, as the trio continue to test positive for Covid‑19. Guardiola retreated to the away dugout and glugged some water. He did not need to fret. City regained the lead when the purring De Bruyne leathered in from close range, after the Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa presented him with the ball on a plate after failing to deal with his clever pass through for Sterling. Wolves struggled to break City’s endless chain and De Bruyne completed his hat-trick without breaking sweat. The thing about De Bruyne is he makes it all look so easy, merely par for the course. With 10 minutes of the first half to go, the game as good as over, he went haring after the ball, on a one-man mission, ready to prey in case of a Wolves slip in defence. There was the odd scare – Zinchenko and Fernandinho were thankful for the referee siding with them after tussles in the box in each half, while Laporte raced back to pilfer the ball as Jimenez surged through towards Ederson – but this was an otherwise pristine performance from City, all in white. Inevitably, it was De Bruyne who would score City’s fourth. Foden’s cross forced a panicked clearance by Ait-Nouri and De Bruyne was on hand to slot in. Ederson made a fingertip save to deny Jimenez moments after Foden rattled a post, but Sterling tapped in a fifth to condemn Wolves to a fourth defeat in five matches. For City, there is simply no let-up in this race.",Sport/Football,De Bruyne hits four as Manchester City thrash Wolves to keep cushion at top,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/11/wolves-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report

5/12/2022,"This was a result that pretty much suited both parties in the end. Another point towards Everton’s attempt to avoid relegation for the first time in more than 70 years was not quite what Frank Lampard would have wished for before the game but, at this stage of the season, he will take anything they can get. With home fixtures to come against Brentford and Crystal Palace and now a two-point cushion over Leeds, Everton’s destiny remains very much in their own hands. “I’m relatively happy – if you can’t win then don’t lose,” said Lampard. “We have to be level-headed. There was a sense of frustration in the dressing room afterwards but if you had offered us this situation a few weeks ago we would bite your hand off.” For Watford, just ending a run of 11 successive home defeats in the league as Roy Hodgson finally picked up his first point here was enough to satisfy their long-suffering supporters. “I didn’t know how many people would turn up tonight but they supported us in a really good way,” Hodgson said. Lampard had insisted before this game that the stakes in Everton’s relegation battle are bigger for him than any of his Premier League titles with Chelsea as his side sought revenge for a 5-2 beating at Goodison Park back in October. Their task certainly appeared to be more straightforward thanks to Hodgson’s decision to make seven changes from the side that started against Palace on Saturday, with Ismaïla Sarr, Joshua King and Emmanuel Dennis not even on a substitutes’ bench that contained three teenagers. But despite the confidence-boosting wins over Chelsea and Leicester, Everton never really looked like finding a way past Ben Foster even when Lampard threw on Dominic Calvert-Lewin for the last 15 minutes and it was Watford’s fans who greeted the final whistle with glee. With Hodgson’s departure already agreed, they are already making plans for life in the Championship next season having confirmed the appointment of Rob Edwards – 35 years Hodgson’s junior – as their next manager amid complaints from Forest Green Rovers that negotiations had been held behind their backs. As well as Watford’s team selection, hearing the familiar Z-Cars anthem that greeted the sides before kick-off should have helped Everton feel right at home. Denied the services of Yerry Mina, Lampard recalled Michael Keane at the heart of his five-man defence and he almost gifted Watford an early lead, miscuing a clearance after Jordan Pickford had given possession away. Yet while the travelling supporters were in full voice behind the Watford goal, their team was struggling to pose a threat. Promising opportunities for Demarai Gray, Richarlison and Alex Iwobi call came to nothing, while a volley from Anthony Gordon that sailed into the stands summed up their issues in attack. After a turgid first half, the most likely source of a goal seemed to come from Watford’s João Pedro, who, like Richarlison, joined the club from Fluminense but has yet to make quite the same impact. Pickford was off his line quickly to beat the lively Brazilian forward to a long through ball a few minutes after the restart. Richarlison then called Ben Foster into serious action for the first time when his goalbound shot deflected off Christian Kabasele. A loose pass from Samuel Kalu presented Gray with a golden opportunity but he could not hit the target after swiftly exchanging passes with Iwobi. Keane did manage to direct his header towards goal from a corner, only for Foster to gather comfortably. Lampard then had reason to look relieved when only a last-ditch tackle from Séamus Coleman prevented a Watford breakaway. Hodgson responded to the introduction of Calvert-Lewin by withdrawing Kalu for defender Craig Cathcart – a move that had the desired effect. The closest Everton came to snatching the points was a Vitalii Mykolenko shot that was easily parried by Foster to ensure Watford avoided extending a most unwanted record.",Sport/Football,Everton edge a point closer to safety after Watford end losing home run,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/11/watford-everton-premier-league-match-report
5/12/2022,"Normal service has been resumed. Jamie Vardy, without a goal since 1 March, scored twice in eight minutes to return Leicester City to the top half of the Premier League with their first win in eight games as Norwich City’s loyal fans celebrated their biennial relegation from the top flight with unstinting irony. At set triggers, the Norwich fans launched into synchronised leaping and singing, even after James Maddison scored the 78th goal against them this season, the most they have conceded in a top‑flight season. Their last four seasons in the Premier League have ended in relegation but Dean Smith is relishing the challenge ahead. Maddison made the game safe 20 minutes from time as he leathered the ball home, left-footed, from 12 yards out after Angus Gunn could only parry Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s fierce cross from the inside-left channel of the penalty area. Leicester’s resources have been stretched to breaking point at times this season but, after the disappointment of losing in the Europa Conference League semi-final against Roma last week, this was a reminder that the hunger still burns brightly in the stomachs of Vardy, Maddison and, even if his days appear numbered at Leicester, Youri Tielemans. “I thought he was excellent tonight,” Brendan Rodgers said of the midfielder being linked with a move to Arsenal. “The speculation shines a light on him. For me, he’s still the same guy, his professionalism is first class. That’s why I always play him.” Both managers are looking forward to this season ending, for different reasons. “I’ve applied to the Premier League to ask if we can play Wolves tomorrow and Tottenham on Friday,” Dean Smith joked. “It won’t be a big rebuild in the summer. We’ve got players more than capable of performing strongly in the Championship.” This may have been a dead rubber to the neutral but for Rodgers it was dead serious. Eight games without a win would have constituted Leicester’s worst run since Claudio Ranieri was dismissed in February 2017 – Claude Puel departed after seven – and he responded by selecting his strongest available XI, after Wesley Fofana dropped out late on with a tight calf. “We don’t want the season to go out with a whimper,” the Leicester manager said. “It felt a bit flat at the weekend [in losing 2-1 at home against Everton] but we had a good chat. We want to finish in the top 10. In the summer, we’ll look to improve the squad, have a good pre-season and be ready to go flying into next season.” Back in came Vardy, Maddison, Harvey Barnes, Ademola Lookman and James Justin, but if anything the team was too attack-orientated in the first half, susceptible to the counterattack, and it took the half‑time introduction of Nampalys Mendy, a midfielder happy to hold, to redress the balance. Gunn, who replaced Tim Krul in the Norwich goal, had twice saved from Maddison, and from Vardy on the follow-up, in the opening dozen minutes but Norwich had their chances. Tony Springett, on his full debut, was in an inconceivable amount of space when found by Milot Rashica but Kasper Schmeichel saved both his effort and that of Teemu Pukki, who hit the post in first-half stoppage time when sent away by Springett. “There was too much space in the game for me in the first half,” Rodgers said. “So we changed the structure of the midfield, and from the first roll of the ball, we were much better in the second half.” Vardy made one of his trademark runs in behind down the left channel, from Barnes’s pass, before cutting back in on to his right foot. The shot was powerful but did not look goal-bound until it ricocheted off Grant Hanley’s block and looped over Gunn for the veteran striker’s 13th goal of the season. His 14th soon followed. Again Barnes was the provider as the winger collected Justin’s short pass before playing a perfectly timed through ball for Vardy to run off the back of Hanley and unload a lusty left-footer into the near top corner.",Sport/Football,Jamie Vardy double lifts Leicester and piles more misery on Norwich,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/11/leicester-norwich-premier-league-match-report
5/12/2022,"Jesse Marsch has spoken effusively of his use of motivational quotes from the likes of Mahatma Gandhi to inspire his Leeds players but at the rate his side’s fortunes are spiralling, he would perhaps be wise to draw inspiration from Harry Houdini instead. Rudyard Kipling’s legendary poem, If, discusses the importance of keeping your head when all around you are losing theirs but as the door on Leeds United’s Premier League status inches shut, the last four days show they are playing with an inverse mindset. Defeats to Arsenal and Chelsea should not ordinarily define a team’s Premier League survival chances but it is the nature of them which are concerning. Conceding early is disastrous enough, as Leeds did on Sunday and again here when Mason Mount struck past Illan Meslier after four minutes. But to receive red cards in the first half of both games for tackles which are entirely avoidable is the very definition of deepening your own mire. After Luke Ayling’s dismissal at Arsenal three days earlier, Dan James followed suit here with a terrible tackle on Mateo Kovacic that left Anthony Taylor with little choice but to dismiss him. James looked stunned. Marsch looked flustered on the touchline. But the reality is from that moment this game was a formality, with further goals from Christian Pulisic and Romelu Lukaku compounding Leeds’s misery and moving Chelsea eight points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham. Leeds now know that with their inferior goal difference, even wins against Brighton and Brentford in their final two games may not be enough to keep them up. “The guys are gutted because we’re not giving ourselves the chances we want coming into the match, and that part hurts,” Marsch said. “We have six points left, and we have to do everything we can to recover and stay mentally strong. We’re not perfect but we’re together. We have to be aggressive against the ball and try to win balls, and sometimes we’ve been too aggressive in certain situations and it’s cost us.” With the FA Cup final three days away, this was a welcome return to form for Chelsea. Yes, they were aided by James’s red card but they were much the stronger of the two sides, underlined by Mount’s strike after just four minutes. It always felt an inevitability they would extend that lead when Leeds were reduced to 10 men, and shortly after the restart they did that when Pulisic fired low past Meslier. “We played very well from the first minute,” Tuchel said. “I was happy with the level of focus and determination. You need to be disciplined because Leeds never stop running.” However, there were ramifications from this polished Chelsea display, with Kovacic forced off injured after that tackle from James and now “very unlikely” to play at Wembley on Saturday. “We will see, we’ll need to wait and pray for a miracle,” Tuchel said. Mount’s opener certainly stifled the pre-match atmosphere inside Elland Road, with the tension all too palpable as the games begin to run out. Leeds could, and perhaps should, have been more than one goal behind by half-time but the result was decided by James’s shocking tackle. He certainly got the ball but the Welshman was also high, reckless and dangerous in doing so, and despite protestation from the home supporters, the replays left James with little supporting evidence. So when Pulisic scored past Meslier 10 minutes after the restart, any notion Leeds could scramble at least a point from such a desperate situation was swept aside. There was endeavour in response but not a single shot on target, underlining another of Leeds’s key problems. But Chelsea deserve credit for the manner in which they handled a rumbustious home crowd and a potentially tricky evening’s work. The third goal always felt inevitable but after a slew of missed chances it took until the final seven minutes to arrive. Diego Llorente dallied in possession in midfield, Chelsea sprung on the counter and Lukaku eventually rifled into the top corner to seal a victory which takes Tuchel’s side a step closer to securing a top-four finish which, at one stage, seemed like an inevitability. This result will have certainly built confidence before the final on Saturday evening, if nothing else. But as Chelsea cantered to victory and the momentum from Marsch’s arrival dissipated further into a mere flutter, it was hard not to think of the last days of Marcelo Bielsa and wonder if, really, Leeds are any better off than the day they decided to part company with the Argentinian. Only the next two fixtures, their biggest in living memory, will tell us the answer decisively.",Sport/Football,Chelsea stroll to victory and crank up pressure on 10-man Leeds,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/11/leeds-united-chelsea-premier-league-match-report
5/12/2022,"As Tony Ralston crossed for Giorgios Giakoumakis to open the scoring, Celtic’s party was in full swing. Ange Postecoglou’s side, needing just a point to secure the Scottish Premiership title, had Dundee United at arm’s length. United’s response, via a glorious Dylan Levitt moment, created brief moments of panic in the Celtic ranks. But only that. Postecoglou made great play of the fact there are various ways to cross a finish line. Celtic’s approach was to tiptoe, this draw sufficient to leave Rangers an insurmountable challenge. Celtic could have won at Tannadice, they should have won at Tannadice, but none of their followers will care. Postecoglou, quite appropriately last of the Celtic contingent to leave the field, has overturned a 25-point deficit from the end of last season. Those in hoops have a new hero. “It has been an enormous effort,” said Postecoglou. “No one gave us much of a chance at the start of the season, so to achieve ‘the ultimate’ is an unbelievable effort. I couldn’t be happier but I am really proud of this group of players and staff. They have been unbelievable for me this year. I think our football has been outstanding.” The 56-year-old’s exaggeration is wholly forgivable. After all, he is correct to depict the widespread writing off of Celtic’s title hopes. That Postecoglou’s men did not smash the tape to pieces is understandable. The Australian’s team is a new one, pieced together at a time when the club were in apparent crisis. Many of Celtic’s players had not encountered intensity anywhere near that in Glasgow before this season. Having claimed the main domestic prize, there is cause to think Celtic under Postecoglou will only improve. The first half at Tannadice involved shadow boxing and little else. Reo Hatate fired well over the bar following Celtic’s finest piece of play, the Japanese midfielder combining for a one-two with Giakoumakis. The latter’s cross, six minutes before the interval, narrowly evaded James Forrest. United, despite having the carrot of European football ahead of them, were passive during those opening 45 minutes. Rangers were easing to victory against Ross County at Ibrox but there was never any prevailing sense of Celtic being in trouble. Ralston stood up a cross, United’s Liam Smith leapt and missed with his attempt at a clearing header. Giakoumakis nodded through the hands of Benjamin Siegrist. United rallied. Rory MacLeod, a 16-year-old forward, cracked Joe Hart’s left‑hand post with a low shot. Tony Watt headed against Celtic’s woodwork. Soon the tide turned. Siegrist delivered a terrific one-handed save from Jota. Giakoumakis shot inches wide. But just when Celtic looked sure to double their lead, Levitt endorsed his blossoming reputation. The on-loan Manchester United midfielder curled beyond Hart from 25 yards, having collected a Charlie Mulgrew lay-off. Levitt’s graceful touch has been a recurring theme in United’s campaign. Jota lashed into the side-netting as Celtic chased victory to add gloss to their status as champions. Daizen Maeda lashed into the stand. It mattered not.

The Ray can be linked to other Sonos speakers and the subwoofer to create a surround-sound setup and grouped with speakers in other rooms for music across the home. It supports Apple’s AirPlay 2 and Spotify Connect for direct playback, too. The new Sonos voice system will be able to take control of music playback duties on the firm’s smart speakers, replacing Google’s Assistant or Amazon’s Alexa. It responds to “Hey Sonos”, and in the US is voiced by the Breaking Bad actor Giancarlo Esposito. The voice control will be available as a free update, allowing users to ask for tracks, skip tracks, adjust the volume and move music between speakers or rooms. All requests will be processed locally on the speakers, making it faster and more private than Google or Amazon’s services as no audio or transcripts will be sent or stored in the cloud. Sonos Voice Control will be available in the US on 1 June and France later this year, with the UK to follow. It will initially work with Sonos Radio, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Deezer and Pandora, with services such as Spotify coming later. The announcement of Sonos’s own voice assistant follows its recent lawsuit win over Google in relation to audio technology patents, after the speaker-maker accused Google and Amazon [paywall] of using its intellectual property while undercutting it with competing devices.",News/Technology,Sonos launches cheaper Ray soundbar and new voice control system,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/11/sonos-launches-cheaper-ray-soundbar-and-new-voice-control-system

5/12/2022,"A California non-profit started an ambitious project beneath the surface of Lake Tahoe that concluded Tuesday: hire scuba divers to gather the litter in the top 25 ft of the lake. Divers have now pulled out more than 25,000 pounds of debris from the 72 miles of the lake’s shoreline, working in a circle from Stateline, Nevada. As volunteer divers navigated the lake, they plucked plastic bottles, engagement rings, 1980s Nikon film cameras, entire lampposts, “no littering” signs, big pieces of broken-down boats and engine blocks, lost wallets and cordless home telephones, according to Clean Up the Lake. The founder and executive director of the group, Colin West, said he organized a beach cleanup in 2018, when volunteers recovered 40lb of litter from the shoreline near the popular King’s Beach. He chatted with some friends who were doing an underwater cleanup and they had recovered 600lbs of litter from beneath the surface. A light went off for him, West says: “How did all that litter make it under the surface of such a beautiful lake?” His team of volunteers started doing surveys, and they found more than 50lbs of trash a diver each time they went out. They later launched the 72 Mile project to clean up the lake. The divers are supported by boats and jet skis. On any given day, the non-profit organizes 10 people on the water. They have completed 189 dives in 81 days. Lake Tahoe is more than 1,600ft deep in some parts. Pollution from algae and fine sediments have muddied the lake’s famously clear blue waters. The lake’s clarity declined 30%, from 100 ft to 64 ft, between 1968 and 1997, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. As the climate gets hotter and less rain falls, the lake may also be threatened in unique ways: its waters warmed 15 times faster recently than the average rate over the previous century. Picking up trash will not affect these more systemic issues, but it does make people think more about the ecology of the area, the group says. The divers didn’t go deeper than 25 ft to retrieve items, though they geotagged bulkier, deeper trash for later removal. When looking at the litter – including anchors, tires and ropes – it’s easy to feel like people are making bad decisions, West said. But the majority of debris is accidental litter that has wound up there through normal human activities. “You might find five or six beer cans in one area,” he said. “But the sunglasses, the cellphones, the hats, the construction material – a lot of this has happened accidentally or from wind storms. No one is trying to lose a boat anchor.” Some of the garbage will be used to create a new art installation at a nearby events center. In the future, the project plans to expand to three other lakes, including June Lake in the Mammoth Lakes region and Fallen Leaf Lake in the Tahoe basin. Divers will also be collecting data on invasive species and algae blooms while in the water. They also want to monitor the situation after the cleanup to determine if it has changed for the better, or if it is back to the junk. West wants to see increased litter prevention signs, trash receptacles, and education. “We are all part of the problem – whether you are on a boat or building a house,” says West. “So we need to be part of the solution as well.”",News/US news,"Lampposts, rings, cameras: over 25,000 pounds of junk cleared from Lake Tahoe",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/11/lake-tahoe-california-cleanup
5/12/2022,"Babis Anagnostopoulos, the Greek pilot accused of killing his British wife as she slept in their Athens home, had waited for his moment in court and, a year to the day after she took her last breath, he got it. For almost 10 hours on Wednesday the UK-trained aviator stood in the dock relating the alleged events that led to the fatal moment on 11 May 2021 when he “lost control” and smothered Caroline Crouch, 20, to death with a pillow. The body of the couple’s dog was was also found in the entrance of the building. No detail was too small for the court now tasked with determining whether the 34-year-old Greek should spend the next two decades in prison for a crime that has gripped the country. “There is no excuse [for my actions] … what has been lost is irreplaceable. Neither Caroline nor our dog deserved it,” he told the three-member panel of presiding judges at the start of the deposition. “There are not enough times that I can say sorry. I will tell you in detail, and sincerely, what exactly happened.” During his testimony, Anagnostopoulos spoke of what he called his unwavering love for the student he had met on the island of Alonissos when she was 15. Over the course of their four-year relationship, the couple had enjoyed “fairytale” times including an idyllic, spur-of-the moment wedding in Portugal “that you only see in films”. “My absolute priority in everything was her happiness,” he said describing his joy when Caroline, who had previously suffered a miscarriage, gave birth to their daughter Lydia. “She may have been younger but she was very mature and she was maturing fast.” The judge repeatedly interjected, cajoling the defendant – described by psychologists who had also testified in the court as “narcissistic and controlling” – for speaking of his wife in the present “when she is dead and cannot be brought back” and urging him not to “overanalyse”. For 37 days Anagnostopoulos had tried to pin the murder on a botched break-in by ruthless foreign thieves, prompting police to speak of the pilot’s skills as a consummate actor. On Wednesday his self-described goal was to prove that Crouch’s death had not been premeditated but was instead the result of his being in a “blurred state of mind” that should be considered a crime of passion and treated more leniently. He had previously attempted to lay the blame on the Briton’s “dangerous outbursts” saying he had also been a victim of her physical abuse when, in heated moments, she had lunged out and “punched and kicked me”. On the night in question, he had got especially angry, he recalled, when she refused to apologise for her part in a row and had threatened to hit their daughter – who he subsequently placed next to her dead mother’s body. “I got on top of her [in the couple’s bed] so she couldn’t hit me so easily,” he told the Athens court, saying he believed he had been pushed to the edge by the woman he had otherwise loved. “I told her to calm down … she was saying ‘get up, leave me, go away’ and other swear words which I’d rather not say. Then I took my pillow and I placed it over her head.” When asked by the judge how such love could suddenly transition into such violence he responded: “I had no purpose. There was no logic in my blurred mind at that moment … and when I saw her in profile and understood she was dead from her eyes which were open and her pulse, I lost it, I began to weep and pull my hair and go back and forth across the room … from the day I lost Caroline I lost everything, I lost my life. ” Anagnostopoulos – the son of a schoolteacher and civil engineer – stands accused of premeditated murder, the unprovoked killing of an animal and perverting the course of justice by repeatedly lying to police – charges that carry life in prison. On Wednesday, he conceded he had hung Caroline’s seven-month-old puppy, Roxy, from the banister of the couple’s two-storey maisonette to make the crime look more credible. “It was impossible to look, I left and went into the kitchen so I couldn’t see or hear [it die].” The defendant broke down and wept on Tuesday when excerpts of Crouch’s handwritten diary were read out to the court. His closing words to the court were: “I hope all those who have been hurt, all those who have lost, will some day forgive me. I hope that God will forgive me. I will never forgive myself.” Crouch had described her feelings of powerlessness in a marriage that had increasingly left her feeling trapped and suffocated. She was the 17th woman to be murdered at the hands of a partner in Greece last year.

5/12/2022,"The Vatican has voiced concern after Hong Kong’s national security police arrested 90-year-old Cardinal Joseph Zen, one of Asia’s most senior and outspoken Catholic clerics. Zen, a former bishop of Hong Kong, was arrested along with the singer and actor Denise Ho, the lawyer Margaret Ng, and the scholar Hui Po-keung. “The Holy See has learnt the news of Cardinal Zen’s arrest with concern and is following the development of the situation very closely,” the Vatican said in a statement. Local reports earlier suggested the arrests were related to their roles as trustees of the 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund, which provided legal aid and other financial help to people who took part in the 2019 pro-democracy protests that were quashed by security forces. Hui was arrested at the airport as he was about to board a flight to Germany on Tuesday, local media reported. Another trustee, Cyd Ho, is already in jail for her alleged involvement in illegal assemblies. Late on Wednesday evening, Hong Kong’s police confirmed the arrest on Tuesday and Wednesday of two men and two women, aged 45 to 90, for alleged “collusion with foreign forces”. The force said that all had been released on bail but had their passports forfeited under the national security legislation. Last year, the city’s police department said in a statement that it was investigating the charity for suspected violations of the national security law. The fund has now been scrapped after the disbandment of a company that had helped receive donations through a bank account. Hui, a former adjunct associate professor of cultural studies at Lingnan University, had once taught the exiled political activist Nathan Law. “If you want to punish someone, you can always find an excuse,” Law, who now lives in Britain, wrote on his Facebook page in response to Hui’s arrest. In 2020, Cardinal Zen made a personal appeal to the Vatican in a letter, urging Pope Francis to leave politics out of the selection of Catholic bishops in the Chinese territory. He did not manage to meet the pope because, according to local media, the Holy See was at the time engaged in discussions with Beijing on the renewal of a power-sharing agreement on the ordination of bishops in the Chinese mainland. This week’s arrests were the authorities’ latest move in enforcing the controversial national security law, which was imposed on the city in June 2020. The legislation bars secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces. They also came less than a week after the incoming chief executive, John Lee, was selected by a small number of elite voters on Sunday. Although Beijing and Hong Kong authorities insisted the national security law had brought stability to Hong Kong after the 2019 mass demonstrations, activists pointed out that since the enactment of the legislation, at least 175 people have been arrested and more than 110 have been charged. Responding to the latest arrests, the White House spokesperson, Karine Jean-Peirre, urged the authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong to release Zen and the others who had been detained. In the UK, Labour’s shadow minister for Asia and Pacific, Catherine West, said in a tweet that the arrests “are a further demonstration of China’s aim to stamp out opposition in Hong Kong, and are completely at odds with the freedoms promised to Hong Kong”. She urged the British government to “work with international partners to demand the release of those detained”.

5/12/2022,"Google has announced a series of new products as it looks to compete with Apple on tablets and smartwatches. It has unveiled a lower-cost smartphone, high-end earbuds and a watch due later this year, as well as Android updates. During the keynote kicking off its IO developer conference, Google set out its intention to build a broader collection of own-brand devices rather than rely on third parties such as Samsung using its software. “We’re going for the ecosystem,” said Rick Osterloh, Google’s head of consumer hardware. “We want people to know where Google is headed with devices as an organisation over next few years.” The Pixel 6a is Google’s new smaller, mid-range Android phone, costing from £399 ($449/A$749), shipping on 28 July. It has a 6.1in screen and the same recycled aluminium body, two-tone colours and camera bar across the back as the firm’s high-end phones. It has Google’s top-end Tensor processor, 5G and the Titan M2 security chip from the Pixel 6, with 6GB of memory and 128GB of storage. It will be supported with software updates for at least five years, making it one of the longest-lasting Android phones. The 6a has a pair of wide and ultra-wide 12-megapixel cameras on the back, which support the same improved skin tone and magic eraser features as Google’s top models. Google announced its first Bluetooth earbuds with noise cancelling, called the Pixel Buds Pro, which will ship on 28 July costing £179 ($199/A$299). The earbuds use Google-designed chips, algorithms and speakers, competing directly with Apple’s pricier AirPods Pro. They have IPX4 sweat resistance and the same smart features as Google’s previous earbuds such as hands-free voice assistant, walking directions and instant translation abilities. The Buds Pro can connect to two Bluetooth devices at once, such as a phone for calls and a laptop for music, including iPhones, Macs and PCs. They last up to seven hours with noise cancelling, and up to 20 hours with their charging case. Google showed off its first own-brand WearOS smartwatch, called the Pixel Watch, which will ship in the autumn. It has a round, domed design, is made of recycled stainless steel, and has optional 4G connectivity. It features various Google apps and services including Assistant, Maps and Pay, and the Play Store for third-party apps. It will also feature a suite of Fitbit health and activity-tracking services, after Google’s purchase of the firm, which completed last year. The watch will work with most Android phones, not just Pixels. Google unveiled its upcoming top Pixel 7 and 7 Pro smartphones for later this year. They will feature premium polished aluminium and glass bodies and the firm’s next-generation Tensor processor, shipping with Android 13 in the autumn. Google also announced its intention to return to making Android tablets in 2023 as companions for its Pixel phones. The premium Pixel Tablet will have Google’s Tensor chip and will take advantage of Android 13 with additions for better split-screen multitasking and use of space on tablets, including updates to 20 of Google’s apps, with third-party apps such as TikTok, Zoom, Facebook and others gaining new tablet-optimised designs. Google showed off some new software features coming later this year, including the ability to request removal of search results containing your contact details, automatic summarisation of key points in Google Docs and Chat, and the ability to speak to Google Assistant just by looking at the Nest Hub Max smart display. Later this year Google Maps will gain a new immersive view, which combines street and aerial images to create digital models of cities including London, Los Angeles and New York. Users will be able to virtually walk through the cities at various times of the day with information overlaid, such as weather conditions, traffic and how busy a place is. Android 13 will also be released in the summer as a free update, bringing with it greater customisation and privacy options including the ability to force apps to ask whether they can send you notifications before doing so, similar to iOS, and further restrictions to location access for apps. Google’s Material You colour theming from Android 12 will be expanded across more of the interface, including custom app icons. Now more than one language can be used on a phone at the same time, such as English in a social media app but Spanish in a banking app. The new Google Wallet will be able to collect payment cards, loyalty cards, transport tickets and boarding cards in one place, with various kinds of identification such as student IDs and driving licences in the US later this year. Users keen to try the new features can test out the software in beta form on Google’s Pixel phones and others from third-party manufacturers.",News/Technology,"Google IO: Pixel 6a, Pixel Watch and Android 13 unveiled",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/11/google-io-pixel-6a-pixel-watch-and-android-13-unveiled
5/12/2022,"The Treasury has been forced to dampen speculation of an imminent announcement on the cost of living for a second successive day, after Boris Johnson hinted to Tory MPs that the government was poised to cut taxes. MPs said the prime minister had gestured at the idea of tax cuts to help struggling households, including at a Downing Street garden party for backbenchers. Chair of the Northern Research Group, Jake Berry, told Sky News the PM was “showing more than a bit of ankle” to colleagues on tax cuts. A Treasury source played down the idea, however, suggesting that in his conversations with MPs, Johnson had simply been “echoing the chancellor’s ambition to cut taxes for people”, which Rishi Sunak had set out at his spring statement. It followed Johnson’s suggestion in the House of Commons on Tuesday that he and Sunak would say more about the cost of living “in the coming days”, which led to speculation of an imminent Treasury statement. One former minister said Johnson’s comments to colleagues had not seemed fully formed or coordinated with the Treasury, and said it added weight to the prospect that Sunak could be moved at a reshuffle in the summer. It is understood the chancellor is privately examining options for measures that could be announced before the summer recess, when it has become clearer how much energy regulator Ofgem will allow bills to increase in October – though it is unclear whether these will be substantive enough to satisfy the PM. Johnson will hold a cabinet meeting in Staffordshire on Thursday in an attempt to underline his government’s mission of levelling up the UK. Asked about the cost of living on a visit to Finland on Wednesday, he said: “We will have the maximum energy, effort and ingenuity to help the British people. You know the money we’re already spending. Of course there will be more support in the months ahead, as things continue to be tough with the increase in energy prices.” One person with knowledge of the Treasury’s thinking said: “The chance of doing something sooner rather than later is on the up.” They suggested a temporary VAT cut was unlikely, because it would push up inflation whenever it is reversed. Instead, options could include directly compensating users for the increase in energy bills – particularly if the rise is not as severe as had been feared before recent falls in the wholesale gas price – or extending the council tax rebate many households received in April. Meanwhile, cabinet ministers have been asked to come up with deregulatory measures that could cut costs for consumers without requiring Sunak to sign off on more spending, with the first of these likely to be announced within days. Some MPs would like to see the income tax cut Sunak has promised for 2024 brought forward; but with 80% of the benefit going to the top half of earners, it would do little to alleviate poverty. Calls from MPs from across the Tory party for the government to take a more generous approach have intensified since last week’s disappointing local election results. “The pressure on Rishi is huge, at the moment,” said former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who has called for universal credit to be increased to help the lowest paid. He said the Bank of England’s decision to raise interest rates last week meant the Treasury should loosen the purse strings to prevent the economy sliding into recession. “You’ve got to keep growth going,” he said. “You have to loosen fiscal policy: the Treasury have got it completely wrong.” Carlisle MP John Stevenson said he expected the government to do more, particularly for the poorest. “Help has to be realistic, therefore targeted at the least well off,” he said. “Universal credit is possible, also another look at council tax or the taxes on energy are the sensible options.” Wycombe MP Steve Baker called for policy changes, including tax cuts and deregulation, to kickstart growth. “In the short run, I am always going to be worried about too many constituents not being able to eat, or heat their homes: that’s why I wanted to maintain the £20 universal credit uplift,” he said. “But in the long run, it’s very clear that the welfare state is not going to meet longstanding spending pledges. That’s why the PM must go for growth.” Michael Gove was criticised on Wednesday for putting on a series of accents, when asked about speculation of a split between Johnson and Sunak. He said on TV: “It is an example of some commentators chasing their own tails and trying to take a statement that is common-sensical, turning it into a ‘major’ capital letters ‘big news story’. “When the Treasury quite rightly say ‘calm down’, people instead of recognising that they have overinflated the story in the first place then say: ‘Oh, this is clearly a split.’” Responding to Gove’s interview, in which at one point he appeared to be imitating a Liverpudlian character played by the comedian Harry Enfield, Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, said: “Is the cost of living crisis just a joke to them? This is not a serious government.”",News/Business,Boris Johnson’s hints about tax cuts played down by Treasury,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/11/boris-johnson-hints-tax-cuts-treasury-rishi-sunak-cost-of-living-crisis
5/12/2022,"Rebekah Vardy has denied being willing to lie under oath in the “Wagatha Christie” libel trial, as she admitted allowing her agent to access Coleen Rooney’s private Instagram posts. Giving evidence on Wednesday, the second day of the trial, Vardy also accepted she had attempted to leak a story about the arrest of Premier League footballer Danny Drinkwater to the Sun – accompanied by the note: “I want paying for this x.” Vardy told the high court this leak was a one-off incident motivated by the desire to expose a drink-driver. She also insisted that multiple other WhatsApp conversations with her agent, Caroline Watt, concerning leaking stories to the Sun about other celebrities – including Rooney, model Danielle Lloyd and unnamed footballers – were jokes that should not be taken seriously. In response, Rooney’s barrister, David Sherborne, said this was “completely untrue”, and it was impossible to believe Vardy and Watt were just joking about selling stories to the Sun. He also claimed there were discrepancies between Vardy’s written witness statement and her spoken evidence in court. “What this shows, Mrs Vardy, is that you are prepared to lie under oath,” he said. Vardy replied: “No.” Sherborne alleged there was an established pattern of behaviour, where Vardy passed story tips to Watt, who then gave them to journalists at the Sun. He told Vardy: “It’s not that you didn’t want to do the dirty, it’s that you didn’t want to be seen to be doing the dirty.” The court also heard how Vardy – the wife of Leicester City footballer Jamie Vardy – shared her Instagram account with Watt. This enabled her agent to view posts on Rooney’s locked private Instagram account, which had only about 300 trusted followers. Rooney’s legal team allege Vardy and Watt worked together to pass these private Instagram updates to journalists at the Sun. Sherborne said it was “quite clear” Watt was monitoring Rooney’s private Instagram posts using Vardy’s account, and the duo would sometimes discuss Rooney’s Instagram updates on WhatsApp. “You knew what she was doing and you condoned it,” he told Vardy. “No that’s not true,” she replied. At one point the court heard that Rooney had briefly blocked Vardy from the private Instagram. Watt sent a WhatsApp to Vardy, asking: “Babe, has Coleen unfollowed you?” Vardy replied: “Oh wow I just saw, wow, what a cunt. I’m going to message her.” Sherborne told the court that it was difficult to know for certain if Watt had sent messages to journalists because Watt’s phone – which he wished to search – had fallen off the side of a boat off the Scottish coast. “We will never know because her phone sits at the bottom of the North Sea,” he told the court. The disclosures were made as part of the libel case Vardy is bringing against Rooney, after Rooney alleged Vardy leaked stories from the private Instagram account to the Sun. Rooney – the wife of Derby County manager Wayne – went public with the accusation in October 2019, claiming to have run a sting operation to find the leaker and concluding: “It’s .......... Rebekah Vardy’s account.” Vardy has always maintained the accusation is false and defamatory, and she has brought the libel case in a bid to clear her name. Late in the afternoon, Vardy – who spent the entire day in the witness box – dabbed at her eyes when questioned about the abuse she and her family have received while in the public eye. The proceedings were watched intently by Rooney and her husband, both of whom are expected to later give evidence in the trial. The court also heard accusations that Vardy leaked private information about her husband’s then-teammate Riyad Mahrez to the media in 2018, potentially destabilising the players’ club, Leicester City. In messages shown to the court, Vardy told her agent: “Mahrez not turned up to training again, the lads are fuming.” Watt suggested contacting a Sky Sports reporter but Vardy replied: “I just don’t want it coming back on me.” Watt then said “I can tell someone,” to which Vardy replied: “Yes, do it.” Sherborne pressed Vardy on whether her husband was the source of the messages about Mahrez: “Did you or did you not know that the lads were fuming?” Vardy insisted she was just gossiping and did not have a source in the Leicester City changing room. “Jamie and I never discussed whether the lads were fuming,” she said. The footballer’s wife told the high court she did not systematically leak stories to the media and the idea of seeking payment from the Sun for the story about Drinkwater crashing his car was a “fleeting thought”. She said her real motivation in wanting to leak the story was to expose a drink-driver to public scrutiny. When told by Watt the Sun had already learned about the arrest from a source at the police station, Vardy said she was “fuming I didn’t give it to you earlier”. Watt replied to say “that would have been a fortune 😂” and instead suggested finding out where Drinkwater lived and sharing the information with the paparazzi agency Splash News. Vardy’s evidence is set to continue on Thursday after it was cut short by a fire alarm.",News/UK news,‘Wagatha Christie’ trial: Rebekah Vardy denies being willing to lie under oath,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/11/wagatha-christie-trial-rebekah-vardy-denies-being-willing-to-lie-under-oath
5/12/2022,"Bosses of some of the largest North Sea oil and gas companies have been handed bumper payouts – including a £4.6m “golden hello” for the chief executive of the region’s biggest producer – amid growing pressure for a windfall tax. Most chief executives of the biggest operators received a pay hike, according to recently filed accounts, boosted by the rapid recovery of the price of oil from the depths of the pandemic. Analysis by the Guardian shows the executives of the 10 largest North Sea operators received a combined £54.4m in their last reported financial year, up from £29.4m a year earlier. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sent energy prices rocketing further, earning huge returns for the oil giants, while piling pressure on household energy bills and stoking demands for a one-off tax on companies’ profits. Labour has called for a windfall tax to raise £2bn, and Tesco chairman John Allan this week added to the growing clamour, saying there was an “overwhelming case” for one. BP’s chief executive Bernard Looney is due to face shareholders on Thursday, where they will vote on a “climate transition plan” and his £4.5m pay package, up from £1.7m in 2020. Looney has said that BP becomes a “cash machine” with current oil prices, and the company recently said profits more than doubled to $6.2bn (£5bn) in the first three months of the year. The chief executive of the North Sea’s largest operator, Harbour Energy’s Linda Cook, landed a £4.6m “golden hello” as part of her £6m pay package. Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden received £6.1m in 2021, up from £4.9m a year earlier, while French multinational TotalEnergies’ chairman and chief executive Patrick Pouyanné received €5.94m (£5.1m), an increase on €3.92m in 2020. Smaller operators Spirit Energy, Apache and Ithaca Energy handed their highest paid directors a combined £4.86m in their last reported years. Harbour, which pumps about 200,000 barrels of oil a day, was created from a merger of private equity-backed North Sea operator Chrysaor and heavily indebted peer Premier Oil. Cook was given a buyout of her incentives in EIG, the private equity firm she joined in 2014 and which backed Chrysaor. Shareholders approved her pay packet at Wednesday’s annual meeting. Harbour’s pay committee said it was “fully satisfied” that the buyout award was “appropriate” compared with awards Cook had given up at EIG. Cook entered the industry as a University of Kansas petroleum engineering graduate and spent 29 years with Anglo-Dutch giant Shell, including in roles in London, Calgary and The Hague. She retired from the board of Shell in 2010 after losing out in the race to become chief executive. Cook, one of the few top female executives in a male-dominated industry, later became chair of Chrysaor and joined EIG’s investment committee. She became chief executive of Harbour last April and moved to London. In 2007, she was named the 44th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes. Executive pay in the oil and gas industry has ballooned during the energy crisis, in a bounce-back from the pay and bonus cuts seen during the pandemic, when fuel demand dried up, resulting in heavy job cuts. Boris Johnson has so far resisted calls from Labour to implement a one-off levy on North Sea producers, arguing investment in renewable energy could be hampered by the tax. Looney said there were no planned investments he would not press ahead with if a levy were implemented. BP’s pay committee decided to award him a £2.4m bonus, despite two employee deaths at its operations last year. Rivals including Shell and Glencore cut chief executive payouts after the death of workers last year. But BP said that Looney’s bonus could remain intact due to “record low levels” of other “safety events”.

World Rugby’s council will meet in Dublin to confirm the host nations of the 2027 and 2031 tournaments – the latter lined up to break new ground in the US – as well as the next three women’s World Cup tournaments. Australia has been identified as the preferred bidder for the 2027 men’s tournament and after the union secured the necessary financial backing from the federal government in March, it is little more than a formality that they will be confirmed on Thursday. World Rugby overhauled its bidding process after the controversial decision to award France the 2023 tournament five years ago, after South Africa had been recommended in an independent evaluation, and another late U-turn is inconceivable. Australia last hosted the World Cup in 2003, when England were crowned champions following Jonny Wilkinson’s famous drop goal against Jones’s Wallabies in the final. Jones’s contract with England ends after the 2023 tournament and, though he has recently been linked with a move to Racing 92, his future after ending ties with the Rugby Football Union is unclear. Dave Rennie is the incumbent Australia head coach and it is thought his deal could be extended until the British & Irish Lions tour of Australia in 2025, depending on how his side fare at France 2023. The Brumbies head coach, Dan McKellar, is being lined up as his potential successor – though flopping in France would no doubt lead to a rethink – and Jones’s experience and track record at World Cups is not lost on Rugby Australia. Indeed, the governing body could seek Jones’s assistance in a broader capacity for the 2027 tournament. In 2019, before Rennie was appointed, Jones was linked briefly with a move back home following the Japan World Cup. His departure in 2005 was acrimonious but the 2027 bid team have expressed a desire to have Jones on board. Last month the former Wallabies hooker and bid leader Phil Kearns said: “I think it would be awesome if Eddie had a role in the future of Australian rugby. I think those [broken] bridges should well and truly be rebuilt and pave the way for Eddie to come back in some role.” The decision to award the 2031 tournament to the US, meanwhile, will be hugely significant as rugby union seeks to expand into new commercial markets. The US president, Joe Biden, has given his written endorsement of the bid but there is nonetheless scope for embarrassment if the US team fail to advance through their playoff against Chile and reach the 2023 World Cup tournament. The World Rugby council is also expected to confirm England as hosts of the 2025 women’s World Cup and award the 2029 and 2033 tournaments to Australia and the US respectively. The delayed 2021 tournament will take place in New Zealand in the autumn with England the favourites to reclaim the title they won in 2014. The council will also vote on whether to make the five global law trials – including the 50:22 and the goalline drop-out – permanent. While the 50:22 law has received popular support and is expected to gain the 75% majority to be adopted long-term, it is understood there is some opposition to the goalline drop-out from within the home nations, which could lead to it being ditched. It was recently identified by the current England captain, Courtney Lawes, as the one law he would do away with if he had the chance. It is also understood that World Rugby has abandoned any plans to trial the 20-minute red card law on a global scale amid widespread opposition from within the northern hemisphere. All the while, discussions continue in Dublin over the proposal for a north versus south “Nations Championship” to be launched in 2026. A concrete decision would be made at World Rugby’s next council meeting in November but stakeholders perceive this week as crucial for progress to be made if the tournament is to come to pass.",Sport/Sport,Australia set to target Eddie Jones for role at 2027 home World Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/11/australia-set-to-target-eddie-jones-for-role-at-2027-home-world-cup
5/12/2022,"Piña coladas and other such retro cocktails are back in vogue, with many Britons keen to capture the tropical beach holiday vibe with parasol-garnished drinks after two years of holidaying in the UK. Bars and supermarkets said rising demand for kitsch tipples, such as the mai tai, blue lagoon and tequila sunrise, reflected a post-pandemic desire among consumers for fun experiences and the Instagram-ready appeal of the colourful drinks. Waitrose’s latest drinks report said fruity feelgood cocktails have made a comeback among drinkers keen to make up for lost holiday time abroad due to the pandemic. Searches on the supermarket’s website for piña colada, a rum cocktail made with coconut milk and pineapple juice, are up by 40% from last year. The drink, invented in a luxury hotel bar in Puerto Rico in the 1950s for wealthy tourists looking for a taste of the Caribbean, is now the UK’s third most popular cocktail, after negronis and mojitos, according to a new survey. Jamie Matthewson, drinks trading manager at Waitrose, said: “I think what’s driving it is that people want something fun. Those types of experiences with friends that we’ve been missing out on so badly over two years.” A survey of 1,000 people by Drinks House 247 found piña colada was most popular among those aged between 25 and 44, and 55 and over. Kerry Maisey, who owns the Ridley Road Market Bar in Dalston, east London, said sales of retro cocktails were booming among millennials as their bright colours made the drinks popular to share on Instagram and TikTok. “Our frozen cocktails, which are our retro cocktails – blue margarita and our pink colada, a piña colada with pink food dye – have always been popular, but since October they are the most popular drinks,” she said. “Our sales have almost doubled.” Maisey said the drinks appealed to younger drinkers because they fitted their interest in the 70s aesthetic. “Suits in one colour for women, elements of 70s’ leather or denim coming into what people are wearing,” she added. But she said the appeal was not just ironic. “Younger people are viewing them in a different way than people have in the past. There’s no sense of them being passé. They have that visual element. We do have customers who have seen the drinks online and want to drink the same thing.” Piña colada’s appeal is countrywide. The Drinks House 247 survey found piña coladas were the most popular cocktail in Yorkshire and the Humber and the east Midlands. Meanwhile, Northwich in Cheshire has a festival dedicated to the drink, in tribute to Rupert Holmes, singer of 70s hit Escape (The Piña Colada Song), who was born in the town. Adam Gerrard, organiser of the festival, on 20 August, said: “Most bars [and] now even our some of our traditional pubs are starting to sell cocktails. It’s a bit strange that you’ll see grown men stood in a pub drinking a piña coladas but it happens. Even the Wetherspoon’s sold them last year.” [From Felicity Cloake’s recipe] Piña coladas are made from rum, cream of coconut (or coconut milk) and pineapple, either blended or shaken with ice. They are often garnished with a pineapple wedge, maraschino cherry, or both.

5/12/2022,"Boris Johnson’s offer of British written security assurances to Sweden and Finland was more than a piece of symbolism designed to nudge the two countries over the line into making a joint application for Nato next week, Swedish security experts said. Although Johnson’s key guarantee is necessarily a political declaration, as opposed to an international treaty guarantee, the British commitment was of high value at a time of great tension, Anna Wieslander, the Atlantic Council’s northern Europe director said on Wednesday. Johnson’s visits were designed to reassure the populations of both countries that in practical military defence terms key Nato countries, if not Nato collectively, are committed bilaterally to the Nordic countries’ defence if subject to attack or sustained Russian intimidation. The UK statement goes further than any bilateral guarantees made so far by any other Nato country and is designed to cover the potentially vulnerable transition period between Nato membership application and full membership, the point at which Nato’s full article 5 collective defence protections kicks in. That transition is perceived as the moment of maximum risk for Stockholm and Helsinki and could last as long as 12 months as each of the 30 Nato states must ratify their membership. In a visit to Washington last week Ann Linde, the Swedish foreign minister, was given a broad security assurance by Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor also promised to back the Nordics’ Nato membership when the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, and her Finnish counterpart, Sanna Marin, travelled to Berlin last week. Björn Fägersten, senior research fellow at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, said the British offer “gives an extra layer of assurance in the event of an attack. It is written down and Boris Johnson was quite specific in terms of talking about increased deployments by the military, air force and naval operations.” Wieslander said “at a time of very high tension in the region, it is of great value, and partly because it builds on what exists already through the agreements made at the time of the setting up of the joint expeditionary force in 2015. It also sends a signal to Russia that a nuclear power is willing to do this. I would expect the US to do something similar.” The declaration could not come in the form of a fully fledged treaty since that might take as long to ratify as Sweden’s Nato membership. In a decision that cuts deep into Swedish self-identity, the ruling Social Democrat board will decide on Sunday whether to end 200 years of neutrality, although many say the cooperation between Finland and Sweden with Nato members has been so close it was tantamount to Nato membership. Leftwing critics have said Sweden is behaving like a reindeer in a herd, running in the same direction as the rest. Fägersten said the meeting of the Social Democrats governing board was “the key decision point”, and predicted the party would join the non-left opposition parties in backing membership. “The statements from former foreign ministers such as Margot Wallström and the fact that Social Democrats have brought forward the decision to coincide with Finland’s timetable suggest there will be support.” Asked if he thought Johnson was the best message carrier to take into the Swedish social democratic debate, he said: “I don’t think Brexit or Partygate will affect Sweden’s thinking. We have seen that Britain has been pretty supportive of Ukraine from an early stage, and that has increased its credibility. Britain is a pretty popular country here. We would still like you to be EU members, but we cooperate a lot.” Support for Nato membership has not trailed off in Sweden since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. A poll conducted by Demoskop for the daily newspaper Aftonbladet showed support for Nato membership still rising and reaching 61 %. The same organisation’s poll published on 20 April showed 57% of Swedes in favour of joining Nato, up from 51% in March. In addition, more than two-thirds of the Finnish parliament, according to surveys, now supports Nato membership. Finland, an EU member, has managed to balance criticism of Russia with a bridge-building role with Moscow, but may find that role harder to play once inside an alliance seen as Russia’s enemy. Defence experts are stressing that Sweden could maintain its special role in advocating peace and disarmament by following Norway and Denmark, two founding Nato members, in making a condition of membership a ban on their soil of both nuclear weapons in peacetime and permanent foreign troops. In practice this does not prevent near permanent rotational forces or pre-positioning of supplies. Security service chiefs have been surprised by the lack of direct Russian disinformation efforts in the Nordic debates, and Fägersten said it was possible that future Russian interference would focus instead in one of the 30 Nato states that would have to ratify the treaty possibly over the next 12 months. He said it was also possible Russia, preoccupied by the Ukraine front, simply did not have the resources to respond to the unforeseen emergence of a new Nato flank. Asked what kind of disruption was possible, Wieslander said: “The expectations are cyberattack, disinformation campaigns, electronic jamming, intrusions in our airspace, even something more official, that they have moved Iskander missiles into Kaliningrad [a Russian exclave sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland on the Baltic coast], but they have played with this card before. Their methods are designed to be ambiguous.”",News/World news,Johnson’s security assurances to Sweden and Finland not just symbolic ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/johnson-security-assurances-sweden-and-finland-not-just-symbolic
5/12/2022,"The chief executive of the insurer Aviva has hit out at sexism in the industry, saying “unacceptable behaviour” has only increased since she took more senior roles in the sector. Amanda Blanc, who became the company’s first female chief executive in 2020, published a LinkedIn post thanking people for their support after shareholders made sexist remarks at the company’s annual general meeting on Monday. Investors said Blanc was “not the man for the job” and should be “wearing trousers”. “In all honesty, after 30-plus years in financial services I am pretty used to sexist and derogatory comments like those in the AGM,” she said in the post. Blanc continued: “I would like to tell you that things have got better in recent years but it’s fair to say that it has actually increased – the more senior the role I have taken, the more overt the unacceptable behaviour. “The surprising thing is that this type of stuff used to be said in private, perhaps from the safety of four walls inside an office – the fact that people are now making these comments in a public AGM is a new development for me personally.” Blanc, 54, is well known for being a female pioneer in male-dominated industries including the insurance sector, having worked her way to the chief executive role at Aviva after stints at Zurich Insurance, Axa and the Association of British Insurers. She has also served as chair of the Professional Rugby Board and sat on the board of the Welsh rugby union until November. Blanc was appointed the government’s women in finance champion in March 2021, succeeding the former Virgin Money chief Jayne-Anne Gadhia. The initiative asks City signatories to set voluntary targets towards gender diversity. Blanc said she hoped the insurance sector would achieve gender equality and could “slowly eradicate this type of occurrence for the next generation. But in truth that seems a long way off; even with the help of some fantastically supportive men who speak out on the issue.” The chair of Aviva, George Culmer, was one of the first to hit out at the sexist comments from shareholders, first reported by the Financial Times, saying they were “simply inappropriate” and should not be repeated at any future AGM. “I’m flabbergasted,” he said at the end of Monday’s meeting. The storm at Aviva has added to the perception that insurers have failed to address sexism and bullying across the sector. In March, the insurance market Lloyd’s of London was forced to issue its largest fine in its 336-year history over a bullying and harassment case involving one of its member firms, which hosted an inappropriate “boys’ night out” event for staff. Those parties took place annually for a number of years until 2018 – a year before the former shadow City minister Jonathan Reynolds accused the insurance market of being “institutionally sexist”.",News/Inequality,‘Used to it’: Aviva CEO responds after sexist comments at AGM,https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2022/may/11/used-to-it-aviva-ceo-responds-after-sexist-comments-at-agm
5/12/2022,"As a health warning on the dangers of taking illegal drugs it couldn’t have been improved. Quite who in No 10 decided Michael Gove was the right person to front the government’s morning media round was unclear. But it must have been someone willing to gamble that the minister for levelling up would be more impressive than most of his colleagues even if he was clearly off his head. Unfortunately for the news anchors, they were rather obliged to take the overly chatty Gove seriously. It made for an excruciating couple of car crash hours of TV and radio. First he was asked if Downing Street being the most lawbreaking street in the UK during lockdown, along with Keir Starmer’s offer to resign if fined, meant that Boris Johnson should do the decent thing. The Govester started spewing drivel. The Convict had worked extraordinarily hard during the pandemic and had got most of the big calls right (really?) so he deserved a break. Regular all-night parties were the least that the prime minister should have been allowed by a grateful nation. Boris was born to be indulged. Kay Burley tried to get a word in edgeways but Mikey was sure he was the most fascinating person in the room and just talked over her. Rushing on his run. Even so, that proved to be the most sense Gove spoke all morning. Over on BBC Breakfast, he started speaking in silly voices. “Oh, Big News story in capital letters,” he said when asked why the Convict had insisted the government was going to do more on the cost of living if he hadn’t really meant it. “Calm down, calm down,” he added, channelling Harry Enfield’s 1990s scousers in a terrible Liverpool accent, before wandering on to the set of Good Morning Britain where he happily contradicted himself. When he caught up with the Michael Gove who had once said that reducing VAT on fuel would help the less well-off, he would be sure to give him hell. He ended his trail of destruction on the Today programme, where he said that the manifesto promise of building 300,000 new homes a year was a load of old bollocks. Far better to build just one that everyone liked rather than a whole load that most people were indifferent to. Thank you and good night. Or good morning. Whichever it was, it was hard to tell when you’ve been up all night. He stumbled off to have a lie-down, oblivious to the havoc he had caused. Still, at least the Govester had the excuse that he had been completely out of it. Priti Patel merely proved she was naturally that stupid as she opened the second day of the Queen’s speech debate in the Commons. Though, like many naturally half-witted people, she harbours the belief that she’s actually very bright. So she smirked and patronised her way through what turned out to be a long litany of failure. Her speechwriter in the Home Office must be a secret Labour supporter. Priti Vacant doesn’t do nuance. She only has one mode of engagement and that is to pick a fight. She’s as vicious as she is vacuous. So she kicked off by insisting that the Labour party were either all murderers, paedophiles and rapists or they had friends and family who were. Having got her insults in early, she then got down to the nitty-gritty. Crime was up 18% and prosecutions were down 18%. So the government was clearly doing something right. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, several times tried to intervene to point out that Vacant had got the wrong end of the stick, to save her from embarrassing herself further. But Patel just waved her away imperiously. “Beating crime is the plan to beat serious crime,” Vacant announced. Though she didn’t seem any the wiser how it would work. “We are going to stop people locking on to each other.” Everyone looked blank. Understandably. She then went on to say she was going to spy on spies. Labour’s Holly Lynch wondered whether she might want to start with the Convict who had gone to Italy in 2018 to meet ex-KGB agent, Alexander Lebedev. Patel ignoredthat and talked up the bill of rights – AKA the bill of wrongs – which she hoped would prevent any kind of peaceful protest. People should just learn to be more grateful for everything the government was doing for them. In reply, Cooper tried to explain to Vacant that she had just delivered a long suicide note on law and order on behalf of the government. This was too much for junior home office minister, Kit Malthouse, who said that some crimes had gone down last year. Cooper gently reminded him that it would have been a surprise if fewer people hadn’t been out on the streets robbing one another during lockdown. But not to worry, the figures had reassuringly picked up in the last few months. Malthouse looked as if he might burst into tears. Working for one of the dimmest people in government can do that to you. Still, at least he could console himself he wasn’t as mindless as Tory Lee Anderson, who suggested food banks were a waste of space and that the poor would be better off in a chain gang. Vacant gave him the thumbs-up. Over in Stockholm, the Convict was busy showing that he too embraced his government of all the talentless. As part of the new defence pact with Sweden, he happily signed up to an agreement that committed the UK to defending European institutions. From a prime minister who has undermined most European institutions and plans to ignore international law by triggering article 16. Anyone would think he hadn’t read the agreement he had just signed. Or was counting on no one else bothering to read the small print.",News/Politics,Michael Gove causes havoc on breakfast TV – but at least he’s not Priti Patel | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/11/michael-gove-havoc-on-breakfast-tv-priti-patel
5/12/2022,"Bakery chain Greggs is facing a potential shareholder revolt over high pay for its executives after criticism by two respected investor advisory groups. Bonus payouts for Greggs’ outgoing chief executive, Roger Whiteside, amounted to more than double his basic salary of £575,209, taking his total package to £1.9m including benefits. As a result the investment adviser Pirc said shareholders should vote against the bakery chain’s remuneration report at the group’s annual meeting on 17 May, noting that Whiteside’s pay was excessive and amounted to 79 times that of a regular employee. Meanwhile the proxy adviser Glass Lewis pointed to a 11.4% rise in basic pay for Greggs’ finance chief, Richard Hutton, last year that was followed by a 3.5% increase this year to £393,300. He is also lined up for an exceptional share bonus payout of 150% of salary despite Greggs not paying back £87m in government furlough support received in 2020. It did pay back £4.9m in furlough support received last year. Greggs said it had approved the higher potential payout for Hutton this year because he was “critical in helping to support [the] transition” from Whiteside to new boss Roisin Currie. “The committee believes his knowledge and experience will be essential and therefore his long-term incentive award should be appropriately pitched to reflect the key contribution he is expected to make over the next few years,” the company said. However, Glass Lewis said Greggs’ board has “failed to provide a robust rationale” for the higher than usual bonus for Hutton – which would usually be limited to a maximum of 125% of salary. Greggs’ remuneration committee said its annual bonus scheme had been “designed to ensure that bonus payments would only be made for appropriately stretching levels of performance”. It added: “The committee is cognisant that the payout of the bonus is very near to maximum but is satisfied that this outcome aligns well with the business performance in what were tough trading conditions in 2021.” On the additional share bonus, it said it was “very comfortable that vesting” was justified. The criticisms of Greggs come after a string of shareholder rebellions over pay this spring. Almost 30% of shareholders in Ocado rebelled against high pay for directors at the online grocery specialist this month after it laid out a plan to pay the chief executive, Tim Steiner, up to £100m over the next five years. And just over 38% of shareholders who voted came out against a new bonus scheme at GlaxoSmithKline, which raised the annual bonus for executives at the drugs group from two times to three times their salaries.Almost a third of Standard Chartered’s shareholders voted against executive pay at its annual meeting, after advisers criticised the bank for not sufficiently cutting bonuses after a record UK regulatory fine. Nearly 11% of voting shareholders opposed the pay policy at Barclays on the same day. However, NatWest executives avoided a shareholder rebellion despite a controversial new pay policy that could net the bank’s chief executive, Alison Rose, as much as £5.2m a year. Nearly 93% of shareholder votes were cast in favour of the policy last month.",News/Business,Greggs feels heat from investors over ‘excessive’ pay for bosses,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/11/greggs-feels-heat-from-investors-over-excessive-pay-for-bosses
5/12/2022,"Imagine that on the first day of 2020 you had magically been granted insight into the size and commercial impact of the coming Covid pandemic. From this shortlist of two food-related companies in the FTSE 100 index, would you have chosen to make a “forever” investment in Compass Group, a contract caterer set to be clobbered as offices and schools closed their canteens? Or would you have opted for Ocado, an online retailer with world-leading technology that was about to enjoy a whoosh of demand from locked-down shoppers? For the first 12 months of this race, the winner seemed blindingly obvious. Compass’s share price halved in anticipation of a plunge in annual operating profits that turned out to be as severe as feared – 82%. The group had to raise £2bn of fresh equity to strengthen its finances. Over at Ocado, the share price more than doubled between March and September 2020. The company also raised fresh capital – £1bn worth – but its motive was to capitalise on the many online opportunities that were opening up. “The current crisis is proving a catalyst for permanent and significant acceleration in channel shift globally,” declared its chief executive, Tim Steiner, when tapping shareholders and bondholders in June that year. And now? It turns out that, if your were obliged to hold your investment until now, you were better off backing boring Compass. From 1 January 2020, you’d now be down about 11%. Ocado, after its enormous hurrah, has given up all its gains and then some. From £12.73, the shares went as high as £28.95 and are now 764p. So Ocado is down 40% from the starting line. What happened? The Compass half of the tale was explained via Wednesday’s forecast-beating first-half set of numbers. Students are back, sports events are happening again and office workers have returned in sufficient numbers to make working-from-home factors almost irrelevant. Revenues were 90% of pre-pandemic levels. Inflation in food prices could become a problem, but Compass thinks more firms may be prompted to outsource their catering to save money and dodge the hassles of post-Covid hygiene requirements. Pre-tax profits were £632m in the half-year and the group boosted its forecast of revenue growth this year to 30%. The rebound from lockdown conditions has been rapid. At Ocado, recent noises have been far from bullish. In place of the predicted “permanent and significant” shift towards online, the group in March warned about a “return to pre-Covid shopping patterns”. It also fretted about inflation, the cost of living crisis and increases in energy costs, none of which contained a silver lining in its case. The company still has its long-term licensing deals to sell its kit and grocery-picking expertise to overseas supermarket groups but, say the sceptics, the pandemic really demonstrated the inflexibility of the warehouse model. Supply could not be ramped up quickly to meet the surge in demand. The great market opportunity slipped away. Don’t write off Ocado over the very long term, but the emphasis should be probably on the “very”. It now seems absurd that the company was briefly worth more than mighty Tesco when its stock market value hit £21.7bn in September 2020. At £5.8bn today, Ocado is now only a whisker ahead of the UK’s second-largest supermarket group, Sainsbury’s (£5.4bn). One old moral of the tale is that hard bottom-line profits and dividends, which Compass, Sainsbury’s and Tesco have but Ocado doesn’t, still matter. Another is that the stock market has a terrible habit of jumping on short-term trends and assuming they will last forever. Life is rarely so simple. The reversal described here is just a miniature version of the more dramatic tech sell-off in the US, but it has had a feel of inevitability for a while.",News/Business,Compass v Ocado proves bottom-line profits and dividends still matter | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/may/11/compass-v-ocado-proves-bottom-line-profits-and-dividends-still-matter
5/12/2022,"Boris Johnson has promised to support Sweden and Finland against potential Russian threats in any way necessary as he travelled to both countries to sign mutual security agreements, with their governments mulling Nato membership in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. Holding a press conference with the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, on his first stop on a daylong trip, Johnson said the type and extent of possible support would largely be governed by what Sweden might ask for. Johnson had earlier signed mutual security agreements with Andersson. Later on Wednesday he signed a parallel deal with the Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö. The mutual agreements promise that if either country faced an attack or a disaster, they would “upon request from the affected country assist each other in a variety of ways, which may include military means”. At his press conference with Niinistö at the presidential palace in Helsinki, Johnson confirmed in response to a question that this could involve UK troops in Finland or Sweden: “Yes, we will come to each other’s assistance, including with military assistance.” While the wording is general, the impetus comes from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the subsequent decisions of Sweden and Finland to consider applying for Nato membership, and Russia’s threats of consequences if this happens. Asked at the Helsinki press conference about a potential hostile response from Russia if Finland opted to apply to join Nato, Niinistö said: “If that would be the case then my response would be: you caused this. Look in the mirror.” Speaking earlier alongside Andersson in Harpsund, the Swedish prime ministerial country retreat, Johnson said: “The war in Ukraine is forcing us all to make difficult decisions. But sovereign nations must be free to make those decisions without fear or influence or threat of retaliation.” Questioned about what the UK-Sweden agreement might mean in practical terms, Johnson remained largely vague, but did not completely demur when asked if it could go as far as the UK providing assistance with nuclear weapons. “This is about our joint decision to show that we will support and defend each other,” he said. “When it comes to our nuclear deterrent, that’s something we don’t generally comment upon, but what I’ve made clear is that it’s up to either party to make a request, and we take it very seriously.” Johnson, who dodged questions on UK plans to potentially try to escape the post-Brexit Northern Ireland protocol, and his views on the Labour leader Keir Starmer’s pledge to resign if fined for breaching lockdown rules, said the deal was “the foundation stone” for closer links. “This declaration is something that is about the UK and Sweden standing together, affirming our friendship and our partnership, and our willingness to come to each other’s defence and support,” he said. Asked about Sweden’s decision over whether to apply to join Nato, Johnson said the UK would be supportive. “That’s not for me to comment upon except, of course, to say that I’m sure the UK will support whatever course of action Sweden decides to embark upon.”  This article was amended on 11 May 2022 because an earlier version referred to Sauli Niinistö as the Finnish prime minister. He is the country’s president.",News/Politics,UK pledges to back Sweden and Finland against Russian threats,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/11/uk-pledges-to-back-sweden-and-finland-against-russian-threats-nato
5/12/2022,"A state judge struck down new congressional districts in north Florida on Wednesday, saying that Governor Ron DeSantis, who drew the lines, had made it harder for Black voters to elect the candidate of their choice. “I am finding the enacted map is unconstitutional because it diminishes African Americans’ ability to elect candidates of their choice,” circuit judge Layne Smith said on Wednesday, according to the Tributary. Lawyers for the state of Florida are expected to immediately appeal the ruling, and the Florida supreme court will probably ultimately decide the case. The decision dealt specifically with DeSantis’s decision to dismantle Florida’s fifth congressional district. It stretched from Jacksonville to Tallahassee, was 46% Black, and is currently represented by Al Lawson, a Black Democrat. DeSantis’s new district chopped the district up into four districts where Republican candidates would be favored to win. A coalition of civic action groups and Florida voters immediately challenged the map, saying that they violated a provision in Florida’s constitution that says new districts cannot “diminish” the ability of minority voters to elect the candidate of their choosing. In late April, the plaintiffs asked the court to block the districts in northern Florida specifically from taking effect for the 2022 election. Smith ordered the state to adopt a map that maintained a fifth congressional district stretching from Jacksonville to Tallahassee, according to the Tributary. DeSantis has fumed against the current configuration of the fifth congressional district, saying considerations over race were too much of a factor when the district was drawn. Voting rights advocates say the district ensures Black voters in northern Florida do not have their votes diluted. The Florida map is one of the most aggressively gerrymandered maps in the US. Republicans currently have a 16-11 advantage in the state’s congressional delegation, but DeSantis’s plan would add an additional four GOP-friendly seats, increasing that advantage to 20-8 (Florida is gaining an additional US House seat because of population growth). It’s an effort seen as a critical part of Republican efforts to retake control of the US House in the midterm elections. DeSantis has also expressed skepticism about anti-gerrymandering language, including the anti-diminishment provision, in Florida’s constitution. He said in March that he believes courts could ultimately rule that the language, which also includes prohibitions against partisan gerrymandering, violate the US constitution’s 14th amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law.",News/US news,Judge strikes down Florida governor’s ‘unconstitutional’ election map,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/11/florida-election-congressional-map-ron-desantis-judge
5/12/2022,"One day this week the prime minister promises that help with food and fuel prices will be announced in “the days to come”. The very next morning, one of his most senior ministers, Michael Gove, adopts a scouse accent and orders everyone to “calm down”. Surveys show that more than 2 million adults in the UK cannot afford to eat every day and the cabinet suggests it could help by relaxing the rules on MOTs. You might call this stuff a joke – only no one is laughing. The government is right to point out that many of the forces driving up the cost of basics are global and affecting numerous countries all at once. But it is also high time that ministers from the party of individual responsibility looked themselves in the mirror and acknowledged how, through their own complacency and carelessness, they have expanded and intensified this crisis. A social emergency is already upon us and yet ministers continue to act as if they have all the time in the world. The result is that this year more people will suffer and starve. Part of the responsibility for this disaster can be laid squarely outside the doors of Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak. When the chancellor delivered his spring budget, Russia had already invaded Ukraine. Oil and gas prices were already rocketing. He offered some help to households, but not enough, and promised to cut taxes at some point in the future. When he gave his statement last autumn, it was already clear that falling living standards were going to be the economic theme that defined not just this year, but this half-decade. The chancellor offered some half measures on universal credit and the rest, and boasted about a budget for “the age of optimism”. Such phrases may have felt good that afternoon in the House of Commons, but not anywhere else – and now they sound frankly hubristic. Mr Sunak had many chances and faced countless requests to make the pandemic-era uplift in universal credit permanent and to make benefits more generous. He ignored them all. Benefits are rising this year by less than half the rate of inflation and the very poorest members of society are squarely among those being hardest hit. Jacob Rees-Mogg, among Mr Johnson’s most prominent defenders of late, once described food banks as “rather uplifting”. Given what the Trussell Trust charity reports about the demand for their cans and packets, the minister will spend most of this year in a state of veritable ecstasy. On the day this administration finally tries to do something meaningful on fuel prices – be that a windfall tax on the oil giants or another policy – let it be called what it is: a U-turn, made late in the day because it couldn’t be bothered to act earlier. And time is of the utmost importance. Economists are already warning that a million households will be in destitution this year – unable to afford essentials such as eating and heating – unless their incomes go up. The cost of living crisis is often discussed as if it were all about rising prices, but that is only part of the picture. The rest of it is to do with stagnating or falling income, and the average British worker is currently enduring the third squeeze on real incomes in just over a decade. That fact alone underlines what a miserable period this past decade has been for the UK economy, with interest rates at near zero and ministers constantly promising that a boom lay just around the corner. From George Osborne to Philip Hammond to Mr Sunak, each chancellor has pledged unprecedented investment, exports and growth. What the UK has instead is tepid growth and record inequality. That is a shameful record for the party that has been in power since 2010. You might call it an indictment.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the cost of living: a crisis made in Downing Street | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/11/the-guardian-view-on-the-cost-of-living-a-crisis-made-in-downing-street
5/12/2022,"The Conservative party long ago stopped listening to Theresa May, but that doesn’t mean her view counts for nothing. When she warns, as she did earlier this week, that the unilateral abandonment of the Northern Ireland protocol would damage the UK’s international reputation, she speaks with the authority of a former prime minister whose time in office was consumed by the attempt to get a workable Brexit agreement. She failed. But so, it turns out, did her successor. If Boris Johnson’s deal had met the durability test, he would not now be getting ready to renege on it. Hardline Brexiters have talked about changing the Northern Ireland protocol almost from the moment it was enacted. It has never been implemented as written because the UK government has lacked the will to meet its treaty obligations. Now Liz Truss is reported to be preparing a total rupture, declaring the protocol inoperable. The EU has warned that such a move would collapse the foundations of the wider Brexit settlement. That could lead to tariffs and a suspension of cooperation in all but the most essential areas; a trade war, in other words. The crisis has a proximate cause in Northern Irish politics and deeper roots in Mr Johnson’s approach to Europe. Elections to the Stormont assembly last week, where Sinn Féin overtook the Democratic Unionists as the largest party, have brought simmering resentments to a boil. In second place, the DUP loses the right to nominate a first minister. It is entitled to a deputy with equal status in law, but the symbolic loss of primacy is immense. The DUP is refusing to re-engage with power sharing for as long as the protocol stands. Its requirement for customs checks in the Irish Sea represents another huge symbolic affront to unionist sensibilities. Unionists are entitled to feel let down by Brexit, but the object of their rage should be Mr Johnson. He used their resistance to Mrs May’s deal as a weapon against her in his campaign for power, and later betrayed them with a deal that did the opposite of what he had promised. Then he lied about it. He claimed that there would be no Irish Sea border, indicating that he either didn’t understand his deal or didn’t intend to honour it; most likely both. A responsible prime minister would have set about trying to reconcile unionists to the deal, while negotiating adjustment to level the controls. The EU is amenable to soft-touch implementation, but not ripping up treaties. Instead, Mr Johnson has stoked the DUP grievance, trying to use its intransigence as a lever to exert pressure on Brussels. His casual duplicity has sabotaged Northern Ireland’s delicate political settlement and he is desperate to deflect blame on to Europe. It is a disreputable, dangerous manoeuvre that can only aggravate a domestic crisis and harm Britain’s standing abroad. On that point, Mrs May is right: the Tories should pay more heed to the leader they deposed for sincerely trying to make Brexit work than to the one they put in her place to do a deal in bad faith.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Northern Ireland protocol: make it work | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/11/the-guardian-view-on-the-northern-ireland-protocol-make-it-work
5/12/2022,"The travel company Tui Group more than halved its losses over the past six months and is predicting a “strong travel summer” as customers continue to book long-awaited holidays despite cost of living pressures. Europe’s largest holiday company said future bookings remained “unabatedly high” as international travel bounced back from the coronavirus pandemic, but said there would not be many last-minute deals because it was facing rising costs. Bookings currently stand at 85% of the levels of summer 2019, but the pace has picked up in the past six weeks. UK customers are leading the way in planning their getaways, with British market bookings 11% higher than in summer 2019. Tui Group’s chief executive, Fritz Joussen, said prices of holidays were rising, and the company was facing higher fuel costs for its planes and cruise ships, which risked remaining high. “There will be practically no last-minute offers at low prices this summer,” Joussen said. The travel operator added that holidaymakers were spending more money while they were away, often opting for longer breaks and choosing a higher-quality hotel or room. More customers were booking package tours, pushing Tui’s average prices higher, including a 20% increase on summer 2022 breaks. Tui said almost 1.9 million passengers travelled with the company during the past six months, almost 10 times as many as in the same period a year earlier. The company reported a pre-tax loss of €130m (£111.1m) between October and the end of March. This compared with a €357m loss for the same period a year earlier, when international travel was severely restricted under coronavirus mitigation measures. Joussen said he expected Tui to become profitable again in the current financial year after two years of crisis. “The strong Easter business was already the first important indicator. The high demand for travel and the good business performance now confirm our forecasts: 2022 will be a good financial year with a strong travel summer,” he said. However, the company sounded a note of caution amid the conflict in Ukraine and rising inflation, and said such uncertainties prevented it from issuing a specific financial forecast for the current financial year. A return to more normal travel operations has not been without difficulties for Tui. Earlier this month, it told passengers that they should bring their own “plane picnics” to eat on their flights, after staff shortages prevented it from serving food and drink on some of its journeys. The company told its airline passengers on Monday that it had “resolved” problems with its onboard catering and that they would once again be able buy food and drinks onboard. Meanwhile, some airline customers have taken to social media in recent days to complain about cancelled or delayed flights. Some said they had been stuck at UK airports for hours. On Monday, figures from Barclaycard showed April was the strongest month for international travel spending since before the pandemic, with Britons taking advantage of the easing of Covid restrictions to book foreign holidays. The credit provider, which processes almost half of all card transactions, said consumer spending grew 18.1% in April as airlines and travel agents had their best month since the onset of the pandemic more than two years ago.",News/Business,Tui tells holidaymakers not to expect last-minute deals amid bookings surge,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/11/tui-more-than-halves-losses-as-it-predicts-strong-travel-summer
5/12/2022,"Hours after Vladimir Putin’s forces invaded Ukraine on 24 February, Lucy Shtein, a member of the daring art collective Pussy Riot, knew it was time to get out of Russia. But Shtein, 25, had been under house arrest for more than a year, with police officers patrolling the street outside her small flat in central Moscow. “I realised I could no longer stay in Russia. So I started plotting my escape, which wasn’t going to be easy,” Shtein said in an interview with the Guardian. As a longtime Kremlin critic and political activist, Shtein has an extensive history of run-ins with the authorities, which have forced her to think outside the box. “I have worn different disguises before to dodge the police. Sometimes I would wear long coats, I even dressed as a construction worker once.” So she was well prepared to cook up a new kind of camouflage. On a recent spring day she put on a bright green suit from a food delivery company, which she had ordered online, and slipped out into the streets unnoticed. “It was really convenient that delivery couriers have such big bags. I even managed to put my beloved Mr Rat in the bag,” Shtein laughed, referring to her pet rat who has become a prominent character on her social media accounts. “We have become so used to delivery couriers roaming Moscow, so it was a foolproof way to escape.” After leaving her flat, she took a series of pre-planned car trips, eventually crossing the border into Lithuania. Six months before the war, Shtein had been sentenced to a year of so-called “restricted freedom” for promoting a protest that called for the release of the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who is serving a nine-year sentence in a maximum-security penal colony. She was allowed to leave her flat only at certain times, and had to wear an electronic ankle tag 24 hours a day. While the authorities have frequently targeted Shtein and her fellow Pussy Riot activists since the group first came to their attention in the early 2010s, the invasion of Ukraine has brought a new, more vicious crackdown on any anti-war dissent. In an ominous speech a month after the war started, Putin announced a hunt for “national traitors” and a “fifth column” that he claimed was attempting to undermine the invasion. Taking cues from Putin’s speech, pro-Kremlin activists plastered Shtein’s door with pictures that labelled her a traitor who had “sold out the country”. Shtein, who was also a local deputy in Moscow, said she was initially committed to staying in Russia “as long as she could”. But before long she realised that the new climate of threats and intimidation had destroyed any chance of her living a normal life. “For a long time I aspired to change things from within the country, but the war simply made that impossible,” she said. “If I wouldn’t be able to continue any of my work in Russia, it didn’t make any sense for me to stay, just sitting around doing nothing.” With her escape, Shtein joined the tens of thousands of Russians who have fled the country since February and moved to cities across Europe. Pussy Riot first came to prominence in 2012 when five of its members staged a provocative protest in Moscow’s Christ the Saviour Cathedral against Putin and the Kremlin’s close relationship with the Orthodox church. Three of the participants on that day were sentenced to two years in prison, which they spent in a colony far from Moscow. “I think that protest really led to a personal vendetta from the authorities against us,” Shtein said. In many ways Pussy Riot’s protest foreshadowed the growing role the church has come to play in Putin’s third and fourth presidential terms, with the church’s leader, Patriarch Kirill, now one of the main backers of the Ukraine invasion. Shtein’s escape took place just over a month ago, on 31 March, but only now is she able to speak openly about it. She said she had to keep the move a secret because her girlfriend and fellow Pussy Riot activist, Masha Alyokhina, was still in Russia facing criminal charges – and plotting her own getaway. Earlier this month Alyokhina, wearing the same type of food courier outfit, which Shtein had left for her, also fled the country, describing her dramatic attempt to the New York Times. The couple have since been reunited. “It felt liberating to finally take off that electronic ankle tag,” Shtein said, adding that it would take time before she adjusts to her newfound freedoms in Europe. “Out of reflex, I still put on my socks as if the tag is there. And I still get shaken when I hear someone knocking on my door.” Together with other Pussy Riot activists who have left the country, Shtein and Alyokhina have now embarked on a series of performances across Europe to raise funds for Ukrainian refugees. “I will continue my work from outside of the country. I want to be useful in one way or another,” she said.",News/World news,‘It was foolproof’: Pussy Riot activist tells of courier-suit escape from Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/pussy-riot-activist-lucy-shtein-tells-of-courier-suit-escape-from-russia
