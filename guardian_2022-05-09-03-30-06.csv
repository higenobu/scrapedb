5/9/2022,"On a beautiful Sunday in May a spot under the trees in an ancient woodland would seem like an idyllic location for a picnic for residents of the Devon town of Totnes. But when a group of 200 people settled down on the grass to enjoy sandwiches and slices of Victoria sponge next to the publicly funded woodland, they were actually breaking the law. This is because the Duke of Somerset owns much of the area’s woodlands, and they remain largely off-limits to the public because they are used for a large pheasant shoot. The Duke owns 2,800 acres of land in some of the most beautiful areas of Devon, but the vast majority of it is inaccessible to the public. This is despite the fact he has received funds for the woodland the protesters picnicked in under the English Woodland Grant Scheme, which comes from taxpayer money. Today, the Guardian joined protesters as they walked for a few hours in the sunshine and had a quiet – litter-free – picnic in a field next to a conifer plantation. But by doing so, those assembled were falling foul of trespass laws. The group cheered as they passed a sign which said “no right of way”, which indicated that they were officially trespassing on the Duke’s land. This walk in the woods was illegal because there is no right to roam in England’s countryside. In Scotland, visitors have a right to visit green spaces, and it is agreed they should pass through respectfully and not leave a mess. Harry, a young Totnes resident and one of the organisers of the protest, told those assembled: “We’re here for a peaceful demonstration, ready to fight for a right to access the land. This not about a protest or a big march, this is about a peaceful walk in the woods where we should all have access when it’s so important to our health and wellbeing. We want to be careful, we want to be respectful and we will be litter picking.” Those on the protest made a point of picking up litter in the woods, which are used chiefly for pheasant breeding and shooting. Plastic cartridges and piles of pheasant feathers littered the floor, and in a valley visible from the field the protesters picnicked, there was a “pheasant graveyard”, with at least 100 bird carcasses dumped alongside an old washing machine and a pile of wire fence. Sienna, 25, an environment worker from Totnes, said: “It just shows the excess, these people don’t even eat them. They shoot them for fun and disrespectfully dump them.” She moved to Totnes with her partner Ross, 29, two years ago and the pair were here today on their first mass trespass. “There’s a lack of connectedness to nature,” Sienna said, adding: “more children know the names of Pokémon than they do wildlife species. We need to have access to the countryside so we can teach the next generation of environmentalists and have a wilder future.” Ross added: “I think people need to be able to get in amongst the environment to tackle climate change. If they can’t get in it, it will be a lot harder to show people what they need to protect. The Duke of Somerset should open his land, at least when there isn’t a shoot going on, so people can experience nature.” South of the border, the law of trespass stops people from walking freely around the country. Last year, the Treasury commissioned Lord Agnew to lead a review into access to nature, asking respondents for “radical, joined up thinking” to achieve a “quantum shift in how our society supports people to access and engage with the outdoors”. But, as the Guardian recently revealed, this review was quietly shelved and there are currently no plans to reveal the results to the public. Totnesians involved in today’s event asked for more of England’s countryside to be made publicly accessible. Currently, the public have a Right to Roam over just 8% of England; over the other 92%, the law of trepass still applies. Large swathes of private woodlands remain out of bounds to walkers, with estate owners using them instead for releasing and shooting pheasants, a non-native species of game bird. An estimated 50 million pheasants are released into the British countryside every year – equivalent in weight to the total biomass of wild birds in Britain. The Devon locals shouted: “Less room for pheasants! More room for peasants!” as they entered the forbidden territory, which was empty but for a couple of estate managers, who kept a suspicious eye on the protesters. Though they did not want to speak to the Guardian, the estate managers seemed amused by the peaceful group, who were chanting about pheasants as they strolled through the bluebell woods. Guy Shrubsole is an author and one of the leading voices in the right to roam campaign. He lives near Totnes. On today’s march, he said: “Regular access to nature is vital to people’s physical and mental health, yet so much of England’s countryside is shut off behind fences and intimidating signs. “Many woodlands – like those owned by the Duke – are off-limits to the public because they’re brimming with pheasants put there for a few days’ shooting, with hugely detrimental impacts on the environment.” He had invited the Duke to come and join the protesters from the picnic, but he did not reply. Shrubsole added: “We are a very non confrontational event today. We reached out to him at his estate address and his House of Lords address. We wanted to say, if you go down to the woods today you might be a bit surprised by the numbers there. But you’re also very welcome to come and join us for a picnic and have a discussion about perhaps negotiating better access in the future.” The Duke of Somerset did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian. Frankie Gould, another local resident involved in the event, said: “Since our local group started trespassing last year we’ve visited many woods that are off-limits to the public, shut away behind barbed wire fences and Keep Out signs. “Yet the landowners of all the woods we’ve visited have benefited from publicly funded woodland grants. Public money, but no public access – how is that right? “The Forestry Commission and Woodland Trust give the public full access to their woods – why shouldn’t big private landowners do the same?”",News/UK news,‘Access is vital’: picnicking protesters target Duke of Somerset’s woods,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/08/picnic-protesters-duke-of-somerset-woods-right-to-roam-totnes
5/9/2022,"And then there were none. Racing 92’s rock stars may have turned up fashionably late to the party but ultimately they sprinkled more than enough stardust to sink Sale Sharks and ensure there will be no Premiership sides in the Champions Cup semi-finals for the second season running. Finn Russell’s inspired piece of improvisation – twice kicking the ball to the line before dotting down – came soon after a similarly stunning piece of skill from Teddy Thomas and swung the tie in Racing’s favour. They were the standout moments from a side who have yet to utterly convince that this will be their year but who possess an ability to strike that Sale can only dream of. It helps, too, to have a 19-year-old scrum-half who possesses as much class as Nolann Le Garrec. With the Premiership’s salary cap coming down, clubs have had to cut their cloth accordingly and the gulf between English sides and the continental European elite is likely to get wider. Like Leicester on Saturday, Sale cannot be faulted for their efforts but while the Premiership produced four of the five winners of this tournament before this lean spell began, it is hard to predict when their next success will come. For, once Racing had their dander up, Juan Imhoff and Max Spring added scintillating finishes to underline the superior scoring ability at their disposal. Compounding matters for the visitors, Tom Curry, making his first start since suffering a hamstring injury during the Six Nations, limped off after 55 minutes with an ankle problem. Sale, as you’d expect, left everything on the pitch. They defended with a resilience, particularly in a first half, that made you wonder whether they might just claim a first win in the competition on French soil in 11 matches. They took the lead into the interval thanks to an opportune score from Manu Tuilagi and demonstrated unwavering commitment throughout. Unfortunately, it was an all too familiar tale, an eerily similar outcome to last season’s quarter-final exit at the hands of La Rochelle – Racing’s last-four opponents next Sunday in Lens. “We need to get better,” said Sale’s director of rugby Alex Sanderson. “I believe we can and we will get better. We’ve got a taste for it now. The boys like the taste. I’m pretty certain it won’t be the last time we’re into these kinds of occasions. You have to experience it, lose and come back that little bit stronger.” What was, in truth, a pretty dreadful first half came to life in the final minute when a wayward pass from De Klerk went to ground behind Tuilagi, who gathered, spun, spotted a gap left by overzealous Racing defenders and breezed under the posts. Sale deserved their lead given their defensive performance hitherto. De Klerk thundering into Camille Chat and driving him backwards was just one of countless tackles that left their mark and barring the odd dart from Le Garrec, Racing had rarely threatened. Le Garrec had notched two penalties to Rob Du Preez’s one but with Bevan Rodd and Nick Schonert giving Sale ascendancy at the scrum and Tom Curry ensuring the visitors gave as good as they got at the breakdown, Racing could find little of the rhythm that can make them so dangerous. That said, Racing began the second half in a significantly higher gear. Russell’s diagonal grubber was gathered by Thomas, who did superbly well to gather and not breach the right-hand touchline with his foot. He did even better to kick the ball in mid-air and race ahead to score. Le Garrec added another penalty before an overcooked Sale grubber came Russell’s way inside his own half. He hacked skyward on the half-volley, chased his kick and the bounce was desperately cruel on AJ MacGinty, perfect for Russell to kick again before rounding off a score that brought a trademark grin from the Scotland fly-half. He was still wearing it when insisting it was entirely deliberate but players like Russell have a habit of conjuring these moments. To their credit, Sale rallied and came back within a score after a close-range try from Akker Van der Merwe before Imhoff dashed over on the left two more penalties from Le Garrec. Still Sale came again, Ben Curry going over at the back of driving maul, but Spring’s score came with MacGinty in the sin-bin and after Racing had sliced the Sharks open with a ruthlessness that gave the English side a glimpse of just how much more they must improve to triumph in encounters such as these.",Sport/Sport,Finn Russell’s stunner for Racing 92 knocks Sale out of Champions Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/08/finn-russells-stunner-for-racing-92-knocks-sale-out-of-champions-cup
5/9/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has brought shame on Russia and the sacrifices its people made to defeat Nazi Germany in the second world war, leaders of the G7 leading western economies said in a statement on Sunday marking the 77th anniversary of the war’s end. The statement, made after a video conference between the G7 leaders and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was intended as a rallying call by liberal democracies in advance of Russia’s May 9 Victory Day parade in Moscow. The G7 statement said: “Through its invasion of and actions in Ukraine since 2014, Russia has violated the international rules-based order, particularly the UN Charter, conceived after the second world war to spare successive generations from the scourge of war. “President Putin and his regime now chose to invade Ukraine in an unprovoked war of aggression against a sovereign country. His actions bring shame on Russia and the historic sacrifices of its people.” The leaders also accused him of “an attack on feeding the world” if he does not comply with international law end the blockade on Ukrainian food exports. Collectively since the war started the G7 said it had provided Ukraine with $24bn (£19.5) for financial and material support. Separately, in a televised address to the German people, Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, vowed Germany will not be paralysed by fear or allow Russia to dictate the terms of any peace deal in Ukraine. In their joint statement the G7 said they will collectively end their dependence on Russian energy ‘in a timely and orderly way” but no precise timetable was set, reflecting the continued divisions in Europe about the speed with which such a phaseout can be achieved. In a clarification of war aims, the G7 statement said “Ukraine’s ultimate aim is to ensure full withdrawal of Russia’s military forces and equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine and to secure its ability to protect itself in the future”. Talks between diplomats in Brussels continued on Sunday to try to secure EU wide unanimity on a timetable for a phase out of Russian energy, but the discussions were described as hard going. Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic have been offered permission to continue importing Russian oil until the end of 2024, but they also want help securing new sources of oil and retooling their refineries. Budapest wants a five-year period to wean itself off Russian oil and says it will need a new pipeline with Croatia, which has access to the sea. The diplomatic activity came as Joe Biden’s wife, Jill, made a detour from her trip to Slovakia and Romania to visit refugees on an unannounced visit to Ukraine, where she met with the Zelensky’s wife, Olena. On a busy day for VIP visits into Ukraine the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau toured Irpin, a Kyiv suburb and scene of some of the worst early Russia attacks. The president of the German Bundestag, Bärbel Bas, and the Croatian prime minister, Andrej Plenković, also met Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Sunday. In the Kyiv metro, Edge and Bono from the rock band U2 at the invitation of Zelenskiy performed Angel of Harlem alongside a Ukrainian soldier. Bas is the most senior German politician to visit the capital. She took part in commemorative events on the anniversary of the end of the second world war, as well as discussed the vexed issue of German arms exports to Ukraine. It is expected that German foreign minister, Annalea Baerbock, a surprise advocate of arms exports, will go to Ukraine shortly. Irpin’s mayor, Oleksandr Markushyn, posted pictures on an official social media channel with pictures of Trudeau writing that the Canadian prime minister “came to Irpin to see with his own eyes all the horror that the Russian occupiers had done to our city”. Markushyn said Trudeau “saw – not military facilities – but burned and completely destroyed homes of Irpin residents, who until recently enjoyed life and had their own plans for the future”. On Monday Macron will travel to Berlin for talks with Scholz and to make a major address.",News/World news,"Putin’s invasion of Ukraine brings shame on Russia, G7 leaders say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/putins-actions-in-ukraine-bring-shame-on-russia-says-g7
5/9/2022,"Don’t mention the Bernabéu. The travelling Newcastle supporters did so, although it felt as though they might have got away with it. For Manchester City, this was all about trying to move on. The wounds from last Wednesday’s Champions League horror show at Real Madrid, when they surrendered a two-goal aggregate lead in stoppage time before going out, may never entirely heal. It is about learning to live with them, stepping into a new reality and it is one that Pep Guardiola intends to gild with a fourth Premier League title in five seasons. The competition is the truest measure of a team over the course of a season and, if City could pull it off, again, then how could they feel hollow? Right? City had caught a break from the Fates on Saturday night when Liverpool were held to a draw by Tottenham at Anfield. It meant that City had the room for one draw in their run-in but nobody at the club wanted anything other than a victory here over a Newcastle team that has been reinvigorated by Eddie Howe. Inspired by Kevin De Bruyne, they got it. There had been a few nerves at the start but City soon hit their stride, Raheem Sterling scoring the opener and Aymeric Laporte benefitted after a handling error by the Newcastle goalkeeper, Martin Dubravka. The second half would be a procession. Rodri got the third and, with Jack Grealish prominent, City would enhance their goal difference late on, the substitute Phil Foden and Sterling again getting in on the act. City’s players had warmed up in No 10 shirts, “Agueroooo” above the numbers – a nod towards the looming 10-year celebration of the most famous moment in the club’s history. But this was about writing a new chapter. Guardiola had said beforehand that the mood at the club was much better than it had been on Saturday, which was better again than the Friday, although what happened at Anfield was plainly a bigger healer than time. The idea was that Liverpool’s slip would have a liberating effect on City, giving them a needed pocket of breathing space, but what Guardiola’s team had really wanted was an early goal. They got it, although there would be some jitters before that. Laporte snatched at a presentable opportunity on the volley from a De Bruyne corner and João Cancelo did likewise from a similar position when another cross from the Belgian came to him at the far post. And before that, Newcastle ought to have opened the scoring. When Allan Saint-Maximin picked up the ball on the right after a quick counter, he had Joelinton in yards of space in the area, so much that it felt incongruous. He could not work the cross. But he would do moments later and Chris Wood was all alone for the header. He directed it wastefully at Ederson. The City breakthrough came on 19 minutes and it was created by Ilkay Gündogan, whose clipped cross to the far post was made to measure for Cancelo. The full-back headed square and Sterling got there first to nod home. City came to control the first half, with De Bruyne in the mood to impose himself. He drove with the ball at his feet, leaving black-and-white shirts in his wake, while his passing was the classic mix of fizz and precision. Newcastle flickered again in the 24th minute when Jamal Lascelles headed a corner goalwards and watched the ball hit Bruno Guimarães, who was offside. Wood rammed the loose ball past Ederson but the flag would go up against Guimarães. City turned the screw. Sterling beat Matt Targett to usher in Cancelo, who was denied by Dubravka at the near post; De Bruyne picked out Gabriel Jesus, who could not control, and Oleksandr Zinchenko almost connected with Jesus after more prompting from De Bruyne. Jesus would stretch again in first-half stoppage time for a De Bruyne cross but again he could not convert. City’s second was a disaster for Dubravka. He could not hold a Gundogan volley from the edge of the area after a De Bruyne corner and, although it came to him through a crowd, he had to do better. He almost redeemed himself by clawing the loose ball away from Ruben Dias but it broke to Laporte who had a tap-in. Two goals up and in control. What could possibly go wrong? Nothing, as it turned out. City set the tone for the sleeper hold that they put on the second half by gorging on 99% of the possession in the opening eight minutes. They made sure of the result on the hour mark when Rodri timed his run towards the near post to flick in De Bruyne’s corner. It was not a goal that the visitors will enjoy watching back. Amid the blocks and screens inside the area, Rodri was allowed to find the space too easily. Guardiola led the applause for Jesus when he substituted him, urging the crowd to acknowledge the striker, just as he had done in the 33rd minute when Gündogan chased back to crowd out the breaking Saint-Maximin. Howe introduced Callum Wilson and Kieran Trippier after lengthy injury lay-offs and both looked rusty. Wilson missed a one-on-one with Ederson in the 83rd minute and Trippier was easily beaten by Grealish on the fourth City goal. When Grealish pulled back, Zinchenko’s cross-shot was turned home by Foden. City saved the best until last. Grealish again made ground up the left and, after he got a lovely flick back from Foden, he ushered in Sterling, who fired home. Two goals after the 90th minute. This time, City could enjoy them.",Sport/Football,Manchester City back on top after Sterling sparks rout of Newcastle,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/08/manchester-city-newcastle-premier-league-match-report
5/9/2022,"Senator Kirsten Gillibrand on Sunday called the battle over abortion rights in the US the “biggest fight of a generation”. The New York Democrat urged her party to stand up to concerted efforts from Republicans seeking to abolish the constitutional right, and called the news of the draft US supreme court opinion leaked last week revealing a conservative-leaning super-majority support overturning the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision “bone-chilling”. She told CNN’s State of the Union Sunday politics talk show: “This is the biggest fight of a generation … and if America’s women and the men who love them do not fight right now, we will lose the basic right to make decisions, to have bodily autonomy and to decide what our futures look like.” Mississippi long-time Republican governor Tate Reeves praised the draft ruling. His state has the case currently before the court that includes the option not just to severely restrict the procedure further but specifically to overturn the Roe v Wade opinion that made abortion a federal right, which was reaffirmed by the supreme court in 1992. “While this is a great victory for the pro-life movement, it is not the end. In fact, it’s just the beginning,” Reeves said. A ban in Mississippi would not make exceptions for incest or a fetus with severe abnormalities that would stand little chance of surviving after birth. He talked of providing more education for women, to help them get better jobs to support children. Gillibrand called Reeves “paternalistic” and his and the court’s stance outrageous. “It’s taking away women’s right for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, our right to be a full citizen,” she said, adding that women are “half citizens under this ruling and if this is put into law, it changes the foundation of America”. Reeves said Mississippi plans to improve adoption processes and foster care systems, despite the state having a poor record on healthcare for low-wealth women, in particular, and provide more resources for those expecting. Gillibrand said: “I thought he was quite paternalistic towards women. He indicated…that all we need is more education for women. I was pretty offended by his remarks. He doesn’t look at women as full citizens.” Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, a fellow New York Democrat, said on Sunday that a piece of legislation that has been stalled in Congress would be put to the vote by the Senate this week. The Women’s Health Protection Act, which enshrines the rights afforded by Roe into federal legislation, rather than relying on court decisions, has passed the House of Representatives but was struck down in the senate in March, with one Democrat joining Republicans in opposing it. That vote may not change but Democrats are eager to force senators to note on the record whether they would still refuse to protect the right, in light of the likelihood that the supreme court will overturn Roe. The supreme court normally does not issue final decisions on the cases in each term until June, so there is still room for a change in the justices’ opinion, but observers lean towards that being unlikely. Minnesota Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar told ABC’s This Week host Martha Raddatz that there were Democrats in Congress and Democratic candidates who do not support abortion rights. But she said: “You have people who are personally pro-life but believe that that decision should be a woman’s personal choice, even if they might not agree with them. We have people in our party who vote to uphold Roe v Wade who might have different personal opinions, that’s a really important distinction.” “In the wake of the leaked draft, activists on both sides of the debate immediately began mobilizing for a drastic shift in America’s abortion laws.” @MarthaRaddatz sits down with the leaders of two advocacy groups: https://t.co/ECy1oebCRT pic.twitter.com/fU8IVPgdlf She accused the supreme court, which achieved a right-leaning controlling majority after Donald Trump nominated three justices – now having six conservatives and only three liberal-leaning judges on the nine-member bench, of wanting to take America back into ancient history. The draft opinion was written by conservative justice Samuel Alito. “The court is looking at reversing 50 years of women’s rights, and the fall will be swift. Over 20 states have laws [to ban] in place already. Who should make this decision, should it be a woman and her doctor, or a politician? Should it be [conservative Republican Senator] Ted Cruz…or a woman and her family? Justice Alito is literally not just taking us back to the 1950s, he’s taking us back to the 1850s,” Klobuchar said. Pro-abortion rights groups NARAL pro-choice America, Planned Parenthood and Emily’s List plan between the three of them to put more than $150m into campaigns to support abortion rights advocates as political candidates in elections this year. Mini Timmaraju, president of NARAL, told ABC: “As a movement, this has been probably the most devastating year since pre-1973.”",News/US news,Gillibrand calls abortion rights ‘fight of generation’ after ‘bone-chilling’ court draft opinion,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/08/kirsten-gillibrand-democrat-abortion-rights-fight-of-generation

5/9/2022,"Akuch Kuol Anyieth always had in the back of her mind that she would write the story of her life and that of her family and friends. She wanted to record an honest account of refugee life and resettlement in Australia. Her family would cry as she read each draft chapter to them, but she knew her task was important; a form of advocacy for greater understanding of the mental illness suffered by traumatised refugees who have been through war. “In a nutshell, you bring yourself with you,” she says. “We receive them as refugees, yes; we understand they come from countries facing war or political disagreement … we’re very focused on service provision and a material-things level, [but] not on a ‘what-happened-to-you’ level: let’s talk about your history, your journey that made you move to Australia.” Having completed her first master’s degree at 25, Anyieth is researching a PhD on the effect of family violence intervention orders on the South Sudanese community in Australia. “Do they really stop the violence?” she says. “I’m not so sure.” Fleeing at age five with her mother, Mary, and her siblings to a refugee camp while her father fought in the civil war, Anyieth, now 31, escaped tribal conflict. She would encounter more violence in this supposed sanctuary in the form of an older brother. In the camp at Kakuma, in arid, remote north-west Kenya, where she would shelter with her family into her teenage years, this brother, renaming himself Dragon, threatened and assaulted three generations of the family, Anyieth writes with compassion and raw honesty in her memoir Unknown: a refugee’s story. Dragon – struggling with his past trauma, substance abuse and settling in to a foreign land – continued to physically attack his sisters and their mother even after they arrived in Melbourne in 2005. These assaults prompted Victoria Police to issue family violence intervention orders against Dragon. He was imprisoned for breaching the orders, but Anyieth says the family little understood what the orders actually meant. She and her mother would scour parks for Dragon to check on his welfare and bring him food, shocked to find him “looking like he had been homeless for months”, Anyieth writes. One of the most emotionally affecting passages in her memoir occurs after Dragon suffers serious brain injuries when hit by a train, and she and her sister Atong “burst into soundless tears” by his hospital bed. Despite his past attacks, she still loves and can see the good in him. Anyieth writes Dragon is a different man today: happily married, a “wonderful husband” and “hands-on father”, with a good relationship with his mother and sisters. “He is no longer violent to anyone,” she writes. Why are the women in her family so strong and forgiving? “When you grow up in mayhem, you have no choice but to be strong,” says Anyieith, a gold Christian cross hanging around her neck. “Particularly having grown up in Kakuma in the refugee camp, life there is very challenging. The majority of the men would be off in the war, and some of the boys [too] … and when you leave the responsibility of the entire family on one woman, automatically they have to be strong, otherwise the children won’t survive, otherwise the family would just fall apart.” Life in her new country would require such strength. Anyieth writes that she is grateful to have left the “dire situation of despair”, and to come to a better place, but “can’t remember ever feeling truly free in Australia”. “Racism and discrimination still hold us back as a community from fully experiencing freedom and fully becoming Australians.” Anyieth’s memoir takes a deep dive into media portrayals of young African men in Australia, particularly in Melbourne: “No one wants to condone criminal activities, but we’ve all heard that saying, ‘boys will be boys’. Well, the leniency, the forgiveness implicit in that expression was never exercised when it came to the African boys I knew, especially the South Sudanese boys. The saying might as well have been ‘white boys will be white boys’.” Aside from Olympian Peter Bol, we rarely hear about the successful members of the South Sudanese diaspora in Australia who have become lawyers, writers, doctors and engineers, she says. To what extent does Anyieth believe negative media stereotyping of South Sudanese boys and men as “gangs and lawless thugs”, as she writes, contributes to structural racism and racial stereotyping of young African males in Australia? “The role of media in the society is so important,” she says, because “it shapes the community’s thinking and views toward that particular group. The media is partly to be blamed because some of the stories have been very sensationalised. “Though there are sometimes elements of truth to their stories – there is a level of criminal behaviour and offending, yes, among some of the African or South Sudanese community – [but] often with these young people, there are deeper issues that they are going through in their individual lives, their community and within their families.” Anyieth acknowledges Victoria Police have undertaken more cultural awareness training but says the force’s relationship with the South Sudanese community was damaged by “over-policing” and “racial profiling”. There has consequently been “little uptake” by young South Sudanese enter the police force. “We would like to see our young men and our young women join the Victoria police force, but if we don’t rebuild that relationship, then it’s very challenging for young people to put their hand up and say, ‘I want to become a police officer’.” Anyieth writes that traditionally in her culture – the family is Dinka – parental punishment with a “beating” or being “tied to a tree” is not considered abuse, but discipline. Her memoir considers how many South Sudanese fathers feel marginalised that Australian culture removes their authority to instil such discipline. But these parents, she writes with careful measure, fail to “look within themselves, inside their own families, to understand how some of their traditional beliefs and practices were contributing to the breakdowns of their family units”. Meanwhile her mother’s pride in her daughter’s academic achievements and advocacy for the South Sudanese community in Australia is leavened too with a dose of traditional, though gentle, aspiration. Anyieth laughs that her mother prays to God “to provide Akuch a good man, a good husband” before family dinners: “My sister just looks at me like, ‘There we go again, just find the man already so this line can be removed from the prayers’.” Anyieth and Mary recently visited South Sudan for a holiday, 12 years after the country gained independence and more than 25 years after they fled. She saw rapid development in infrastructure, but, “politically, I’m not so sure”. “Hopefully, if there are no other civil wars, then we’re looking at a very bright future for the country to develop and to make sure there are no more displaced people. “Right now, there is so much diversity, in terms of people moving back from the west or from other countries within Africa, and that could be a beautiful thing, because people are bringing different elements of the world and can really contribute to the overall development.” This raises the question of whether Anyieth, who writes that her priorities are “my work in academia, and my activism for non-violent family units, and for community healing from trauma”, feels any desire to return to South Sudan for longer periods to be part of this development. “There’s so much need and demand in South Sudan because it is a very young country,” she says now. “It’s going through a very rapid growth and development and people like myself who have learned something in the West are expected to bring it back home.” Once Anyieth gains her PhD she will consider what is on offer here in Australia employment-wise, or whether there is a journey to the mother country ahead. “South Sudan will always be home, and so is Kenya, so is Australia. I feel incredibly lucky and so fortunate that I get to be a part of three different societies. All three countries will always be home, regardless of which of them I decide to settle in.” Unknown: A Refugee’s Story is published by Text Publishing.",Arts/Books,"Akuch Kuol Anyieth: ‘When you grow up in mayhem, you have no choice but to be strong’",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/09/akuch-kuol-anyieth-when-you-grow-up-in-mayhem-you-have-no-choice-but-to-be-strong
5/9/2022,"A new education campaign pushing for a First Nations voice to parliament is being unrolled by the creators of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. The History is Calling campaign will urge Australians to answer the Uluru Dialogue’s 2017 invitation to legally enshrine First Nations people in the constitution via a referendum as an urgent election issue. Uluru Statement leader Roy Ah-See said First Nations people had been “at the whim” of consecutive governments that had failed to protect their rights and it was “long overdue” for their voice to be constitutionally enshrined. “The data’s there, in terms of overrepresentation in the criminal justice system, health statistics, infant mortality rates; it’s appalling, we’ve gone backward,” he said. “In 1967, I was six months old when … non-Aboriginal citizens of this country gave my mother citizenship. Now it’s time to give my kids a voice in this country and future generations and we can do that through a referendum. “We don’t want a green voice, we don’t want a red voice, we don’t want a blue voice: we want a black voice.” Ah-See said the Uluru Statement was “never for the politicians”, but was a gift to the Australian people, who were best placed to vote on constitutional recognition. “Consecutive governments haven’t had our best interests at heart and legislation isn’t going to cut it,” he said. “The momentum’s there, the mood has shifted. We’ve lost a lot of First Nations people that haven’t seen a voice realised. It’s time.” The Uluru Dialogue co-chair Prof Megan Davis was the first person to read the statement to the nation. Five years on, she said it represented a powerful moment of “all Australians walking together in a movement for a better future”. “Silence never made history and on the occasion of the fifth anniversary … the empowerment of our people is in the hands of the Australian public,” she said. “The referendum mechanism empowers all Australians to work together to change the nation, as they did in 1967.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Uluru statement was delivered on 27 May 2017 following a lengthy consultation process and three days of talks between First Nations delegates from across the nation. It has not been enacted, nor have the Coalition’s plans to legislate for a non-constitutional voice to parliament been tabled. Last month, the Uluru statement leadership put forward two dates Australians could be called to decide by referendum whether to enshrine a voice to parliament in the constitution: 27 May 2023 or 27 January 2024. Labor said it would hold a referendum in its first term if it wins the federal election, indicating to Guardian Australia its preference was for a 2024 date. It has also committed to enacting the Uluru statement in its entirety. The Coalition wouldn’t be drawn on setting a date but the minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said the government remained “committed to getting it right” and it would go to a referendum “once a consensus is reached”.

5/9/2022,"The days of the bull run are over, said John, standing on the street in Redfern as we watched a tepid auction over a terrace not so much unfold, as haltingly and painfully reached some kind of an ending. “The end of 2020 you’d have 400 people go through a house in half an hour before it was auctioned. You’d have 60 registered bidders, it was rapid fire and crazy,” he said. John was filming this auction for a segment on the ABC 7pm news bulletin. And the story? A slowing market. It was the first weekend since the Reserve Bank raised interest rates by 25 basis points and there seemed to be, as they say – a vibe shift. Prices are still stratospheric, of course. But gone was the craziness, the prices climbing quickly until the house was millions over the reserve, the paddles in sweat-soaked paws and the dilated pupils, the weird feeding-frenzy of trying to grab a piece of the hot market that seemed it would surge on forever. I wanted this place to sell almost as much as the auctioneer. The family were inside, holding a bunch of flowers for the new owner – whoever that may be. In 1962 they bought the two-storey terrace for around $30,000, and it was now for sale for $2.5m. One daughter showed me a photo of her father Socrates after he purchased the house in the early 60s. He looked young and strong and was standing balanced on a fence like an acrobat. Now he emerged from a car looking like a Greek Logan Roy and was ushered inside. I’d just come from a dud Newtown auction where the house was passed in at $1.5m, and only a few people loitered outside – including the tenants who said they had expected to be turfed out and had already found somewhere else to live. Afterwards, I had a coffee with my friend Nick, who shook his head and cursed auctions. “It’s a horrible, horrible system – such a stressful process and results in you locking yourself into servitude for decades.” Maybe not so much now. This weekend the Sydney clearance rate was 59% – down from 80% last October. But it had already dropped ahead of the RBA decision – perhaps in anticipation. It was 66% on the last weekend in March, and 56% last weekend. Has the rate rise, small as it is, helped break the fever? On to Redfern and a small crowd was shy. “You need to bid to get it. Holding back is not a great strategy at auction,” said the auctioneer to around 15 people gathered outside. Bids were going up slowly by thousand dollar lots. An old punk walked through the auction expressing his disgust at all of us – “Oh excuse me! Walking past an auction,” he said sarcastically, pointing at the house and saying “Woo hoo, an auction.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Better not put your hand up mate – you’ll be the owner soon,” said some wag in the crowd, breaking the tension and everyone laughed, and even the old punk smiled. The Redfern house (which needed a lot of work) eventually sold for $2.876m. Then on to Parramatta. This one – a three-bedroom house on a large block, in a quiet street at $1.5m would surely attract plenty of bidders. I was willing to stake a $90 Uber trip on it. But the atmosphere was funereal when I arrived. The agents were packing up their boards and flags. There were two registered bidders but neither showed up. The property was passed in. Agent Broderick Wright asked me if I wanted a lift to the station. We hopped into his new model Mercedes and drove past a little gem that he’d just sold that morning for $1.1m – a heritage two-bedroom cottage in central Parramatta. But as to the north Parramatta property that just got passed in? “It was surprising to me because we had two buyers who were registered to buy but they did not register to bid. Plus we have lots of stock on the market in the area.” The owners were mum and dad investors who had once lived in the property but had moved to another part of Sydney. “There were a few other properties around that were at a lower price. Buyers are looking for reasons not to pay us so much.” As for his overall prediction, “whenever we see a slight change in the market [such a rate rise] we find properties that have challenges are the first to feel the pinch”. But Wright was buoyant – yes, some mortgage holders will be affected “if they are already stretched to the limit, but if anything we’ll see a slight softening. We won’t see it fall off a cliff.” Certainly not in Vaucluse – in Sydney’s east, where I went for my fourth, final and most controversial auction of the day. Does the best street in Vaucluse make it the best street in Sydney? The auctioneer certainly thought so as he laughed off an opening bid of $4m for a lovely three bedroom semi, that had a deep wooden verandah and a copy of an Edith Wharton novel on the bedside table. At $4m “I’ll take two bedrooms out and the parking – it’s very ambitious,” he said. There were plenty of registered bidders but in the end it was a three-way competition, including someone taking bids via phone from London. The winning bid was recorded at $6.65m – but there was dissent from the back of the pack. People heard an underbidder put in $6.7m as the hammer dropped, but the chap was wearing a mask – so maybe wasn’t audible? A few us nearby conferred. Yes, we’d heard him bid – but what came first, the hammer or the bid? News Corp, which was also at the auction, reported the man had earlier declared “I’m out”. The auctioneer confessed this scenario hadn’t happened to him before – definitely not in the last ten years. The man who bid at $6.65m was already advancing confidently across the lawn to take the keys. The underbidder didn’t press it – but he was cranky. He took off by foot, in a huff along Sydney’s best street, no doubt cursing the crazy-making schema of auctions.",News/Australia news,Has the interest rate rise broken Australia’s housing market fever?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/09/has-the-interest-rate-rise-broken-australias-housing-market-fever
5/9/2022,"“Would you like to chat with us, or would you prefer us to keep it quiet?” A new client questionnaire introduced publicist Odette Barry to the world of silent salons – hairdressers giving people the option to ditch the chit-chat. Despite being a “bit of a needy extrovert”, her interest was piqued. From then on, she opted in to silence every couple of appointments. “I actually quite liked having the option to be checked in on each time that I came in,” she says. “It also made it more comfortable to bring my laptop and work and not feel like I was being rude.” Hairdresser Ash Boughton runs AB Colour, working out of the beauty co-working space Salon Lane in Sydney’s Surry Hills. She’s experienced a big uptick in clients requesting a silent appointment over the past few months, and says that because of the pandemic, “the need for calmer experiences has become essential”. “The constant talk of the … pandemic really had such a negative effect on salon ambience, and the lack of positivity was draining for both clients and staff,” Boughton tells Guardian Australia. “Some people just don’t want conversation. It’s really their time to zen out.” Boughton explains that while some clients request silence ahead of their appointment, it’s also up to the hairdresser to display emotional intelligence when a client is in the chair. That’s easier when interacting with a longstanding client with whom she already has rapport. She knows how they like their hair cut, or styled, or coloured. They trust her. “They might say something that makes me realise they just want to sit and work, or just close their eyes and be still. Once the initial consultation is done I take my cue from them.” Redmond Cliff, a salon manager for hairdressing group Edwards and Co, agrees: “Hairdressers are very good at reading people’s vibes.” He says while hairdressing is usually a “very chatty industry”, salons are also inclusive spaces, which means some clients want, and should be able, to “stay silent and relax without talking”. In fact, despite her extroversion, staying silent in the salon chair alleviated guilt for Barry. Since a hairdressing appointment doubles as a therapy session for many, she can feel uncomfortable about “unloading everything on a hairdresser, who has to be not just a talented hairdresser but also a counsellor for everyone who comes in”. As Boughton notes, it also gives the stylist the chance to “focus on our art”, because hairdressing is “a craft that needs precision and patience”. She says it isn’t strange at all for hairdressers to dial the small talk up or down as they switch between clients. Sometimes, some peace and quiet is just as beneficial for the hairdresser. “It really works both ways.” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Barry suggests thinking about how you’ll occupy your time if you’re veering away from a chat. For her, it’s podcasts, a book, or work emails. “You have to have something to do to make it not awkward, because just sitting there staring at yourself in the mirror can be a reasonably off-putting experience.” Barry’s husband, who she describes as an introvert, has also experienced a silent haircut. But knowing he could be quiet if he wanted to made him feel more chatty. Boughton said that’s not an uncommon experience. “I find it interesting that some clients say ‘I’m all talked out, I’m really looking forward to some quiet time’ and then proceed to tell you their life story over the next 45 minutes, or every intimate detail of their most recent drama. “We really do hear it all, but a good hairdresser keeps everything in the vault.” The next salon visit, then, is a choice: stay quiet, or divulge secrets, knowing they’ll be kept in the cone of silence too. Take comfort in the request’s popularity: “The language [of a silent experience] is common knowledge within our industry now,” Boughton says. Let your confidence dictate your communication choice: Boughton urges clients not to feel strange about it at all. You can call to book an appointment and ask on the phone, choose silence on a questionnaire, or “send a message to your salon [in advance] if you’re uncomfortable voicing it”. Be honest: Cliff from Edwards and Co makes the point that “it’s not what you ask, it’s how you ask it”. So ask directly, but kindly. Don’t feel guilty: “Don’t feel pressured into random chit-chat if you’re not in the right headspace,” Boughton says. “We all want everyone to have the best experience possible. It might seem unusual to a client asking for the first time, but at times it’s greatly appreciated by us too.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Silent salons: why people are choosing to keep quiet at the hairdresser,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/09/silent-salons-why-people-are-choosing-to-keep-quiet-at-the-hairdresser
5/9/2022,"An Australian soldier alleged by three newspapers to have participated with Ben Roberts-Smith in the “joint criminal enterprise” of murdering an Afghan villager named Ali Jan is set to appear in the federal court this week as a witness for Roberts-Smith in his defamation action against the newspapers. Anonymised before the court as Person 11, the SAS’s soldier evidence will be critical to Roberts-Smith’s case over the events in the village of Darwan on 11 September 2012, when Roberts-Smith is alleged, by the newspapers in their defence, to have kicked a handcuffed Ali Jan off a cliff before ordering him shot. Person 11 is expected to deny all wrongdoing, and to back Roberts-Smith’s account that the man killed in Darwan – purported to be Ali Jan – was an enemy spotter legitimately killed, as the court has heard in previous evidence. Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. The alleged murder of Ali Jan is the most notorious allegation of this sprawling complex defamation case, which has spent nearly a year before the federal court. The newspapers allege as part of their defence the murder was a “joint criminal enterprise” between Roberts-Smith and his subordinate, Person 11. Australian SAS patrols raided the village of Darwan, in Afghanistan’s southern Uruzgan province on 11 September 2012, seeking a rogue Afghan soldier called Hekmatullah, who had killed three Australian soldiers three weeks earlier. Hekmatullah was not in Darwan. At the end of the mission, the newspapers allege that a farmer called Ali Jan – visiting Darwan to buy flour – was taken into custody and handcuffed by the Australian soldiers. After Ali Jan laughed twice at Roberts-Smith while being interrogated, Roberts-Smith is alleged to have marched him outside to the edge of a small cliff where he forced Ali Jan to kneel and then “kicked him hard in the midriff, causing him to fall back over the cliff and land in the dry creek bed below”. “The impact of the fall to the dry creek below was so significant that it knocked Ali Jan’s teeth out of his mouth,” the newspapers’ defence states. Two Afghan witnesses and one Australian soldier have also given evidence they saw Roberts-Smith kick the man off the cliff. One soldier, Person 4, told the court: “I saw the individual smash his face on a rock, and I saw the teeth explode out of his face.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning According to the newspapers’ defence, Ali Jan did not die in the fall, but was then dragged into a cornfield and shot dead. The newspapers allege: “After Ali Jan had fallen the full height of the cliff down to the dry creek bed he was moved by two soldiers … to the other side of the creek bed where there was vegetation. After he had been moved … Ali Jan was shot multiple times in the presence of [Roberts-Smith] and Person 11.” It is alleged Ali Jan was shot by either or both of Roberts-Smith and Person 11 – “a joint criminal enterprise” according to the newspapers’ defence before court. The newspapers also allege that both soldiers knew his death was unlawful, and tried to cover it up by placing a radio on his body to establish a post-facto justification for killing him as a “spotter”. Roberts-Smith has consistently denied this account, telling the court the man purported to be Ali Jan was a spotter – a forward scout who reports soldiers’ movements back to insurgents – who was discovered hiding in a cornfield by another solider, Person 11, who immediately opened fire upon the insurgent. Roberts-Smith said he climbed the embankment to assist Person 11 in the skirmish and also fired at the man, who was about two metres away. The man was killed and, Roberts-Smith said, found to be in possession of a radio. Roberts-Smith said the man killed was clearly an insurgent and a legitimate military target who could be killed within the laws of war. The court has heard evidence on behalf of the newspapers that a photograph of Ali Jan, taken after his death, showed his arm and wrist covered in blood, except for a thin “stripe” of clear skin where there was no blood. This was alleged to be evidence he was in handcuffs when shot. Roberts-Smith denies this. A former SAS regimental sergeant major – Person 100 – will begin giving evidence Monday morning. Several soldiers have told the court they reported concerns about possible war crimes to Person 100 in 2012 and 2013, but that nothing was done to investigate or hold soldiers accountable. Person 11 is scheduled to follow Person 100 in the witness box. It is expected he will be in court for a number of days. Arthur Moses SC, acting for Roberts-Smith, told the court Roberts-Smith himself would not get back in the witness box to give evidence in reply. “The applicant [Roberts-Smith] won’t be giving evidence in reply … that’s the present position,” Moses said. Last year, Roberts-Smith spent 11 days in the witness box giving evidence and being cross-examined.

5/9/2022,"Education department staff being “conscripted” to fill Covid-related vacancies at New South Wales schools have said they are being sent into teaching environments without adequate training, and were just plugging holes in a broader “casual crisis”. One employee, who has never worked with or been specifically trained to care for special needs students, claimed they were sent to teach a class of students with disabilities. “I was just completely out of my depth,” the departmental staff member told Guardian Australia. That same staffer was also one of several who raised concerns with the department that they had been sent to schools that did not have a valid Covid-related vacancy. A Department of Education spokesperson said they had “received a small amount of feedback about a placement not being appropriate”. “These claims have been found to be unsubstantiated,” the spokesperson said. The department announced internally in January that it would call on department staff with valid teaching credentials in term one, as high Omicron case numbers and strict close contact rules exacerbated preexisting teacher shortages. More than 750 departmental staff with current teaching qualifications were signed up for the scheme, which has been extended for another term. But with the department declining to nominate an end date, staff are concerned they will end up covering flu and other sickness absences in the coming months. Flu cases have surged, with 1,024 cases reported last week, and 478 cases the week before, according to the NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant. Almost 1,100 teacher vacancies were filled by department staff, according to an email sent by the department deputy secretary, Murat Dizdar, earlier this month. “I trust you enjoyed getting back on the tools as much as I did,” the senior official who backfilled at least one day of classes said. Dizdar thanked staff who participated in the mandatory program, noting they had covered “thousands of hours of face-to-face learning that would not have been possible” otherwise. But some who took part in weeks of backfilling said they were often doing little more than supervising the students, raising concerns about further hits to education continuity after two years of Covid interruptions. “It’s essentially babysitting – you are just plugging a hole,” one departmental staffer said. “Quality teaching is where you get to know the children, their needs, you respond to them … but none of that is possible when you’re going to a different school every day. “We’re taking away school support services so we can plug the casual crisis.” Other concerns raised by participating staff in communications seen by Guardian Australia included a former early education teacher sent to work at a high school. Some staff claimed they had been working a dual load, clocking full-time teaching and departmental hours every week, and said they were considering leaving the sector over the program. Other staff queried why they were being sent to schools so far away, with one claiming they travelled an extra three hours a day to cover a country class and another noting they were often sent further than the 25km radius limit for metro staff. Staff reported that some of the practices that had been challenging in term one have been improved since the start of term two. The department of education spokesperson denied claims “non-school based teachers” (NSBT) had been placed at schools for reasons other than to support Covid-19 staff absences and said every request for backfilling was validated by staff within the department. “The department’s current priority is the continuity of face-to-face learning,” the spokesperson said. “Managers support staff in managing the current work to accommodate temporary placements of NSBTs in schools.” A decision for the continuation of the scheme past the end of term two has not yet been made. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The NSW Teachers Federation president, Angelo Gavrielatos, said the scheme to use department staff was an insufficient Band-Aid that needed to be replaced with structural change to increase teacher supply. “It’s hardly even a Band-Aid,” he said. “It continues to expose pressure points and stress across the system. “What I’m concerned about is a piecemeal approach that doesn’t even address the substantial issues that we were confronting.” The opposition education spokesperson, Prue Carr, said the scheme was risky, labelling it a “sign of just how serious” the teacher shortage was. “We can’t have a situation where former teachers are put back into classrooms without proper support, especially in schools which cater for students with complex needs,” Carr said. “A comprehensive recruitment effort is needed to train and hire new teachers.”",News/Australia news,NSW education staff say they are being sent to schools without adequate training to ‘plug the casual crisis’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/09/nsw-education-staff-say-they-are-being-sent-to-schools-without-adequate-training-to-plug-the-casual-crisis
5/9/2022,"The very existence of Northern Ireland is rooted in the rejection of Irish nationalism. So Sinn Féin’s emergence in Thursday’s elections as the largest single party in the assembly is rightly described as historic. Sinn Féin is not just opposed to Northern Ireland’s existence; it even refuses to refer to it by that name. Now, the party has won the right to nominate Michelle O’Neill as the next first minister, a post hitherto exclusively held by unionists. That achievement is not simply symbolic. It is also a genuine electoral success. It should be recognised by its rivals as a proper mandate. But nor should it be misread. Under Northern Ireland’s proportional representation system, Sinn Féin won 29% of the first preference votes, the party’s best performance since assembly elections began. Perhaps significantly, this was the first assembly poll since the retirement of Gerry Adams as party president. But Sinn Féin failed to add to its 27 members in the 90-strong assembly. The extent of the breakthrough should not be exaggerated. Sinn Féin’s success nevertheless embodies a new situation in politics on both sides of the Irish border. In the republic, the party leads the two government coalition parties in the polls. Now it is again poised for government in the north. But this latest success owes more to unionism’s internal disunity than to any widespread new embrace of republicanism or Irish unification. The biggest increase in support in these elections was not for Sinn Féin. It was for the non-aligned Alliance party, which more than doubled its tally of seats and is now a genuine centrist third force in Northern Irish politics. The results are above all a devastating verdict on the once mighty Democratic Unionist party. Although its support rallied late in the campaign, at the expense of the Ulster Unionist party, the DUP’s first preference vote collapsed, losing a quarter of its 2017 support. It lost votes both to the Alliance and, less dramatically, to Traditional Unionist Voice, which opposes power-sharing altogether. It has been punished for months of in-fighting, leadership challenges and feuding (which continued right up to polling day). Above all, it is paying the price for the strategic error of backing Brexit in a part of the UK that voted to remain, and for trusting Boris Johnson. Yet the DUP appears to have learned nothing. Its leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, was the big loser on Thursday; yet he continues to impose conditions for a return to government as if he were the winner. He is yet again staking everything on a hard Brexit and Mr Johnson. He wants the UK government to renege on the Northern Ireland protocol in the EU withdrawal agreement in the Queen’s Speech on Tuesday. This would please many unionists. But it would upend the whole Brexit deal and reopen the Irish border controversy. That is emphatically not the message that the majority of voters sent on Thursday. After his own pasting at the polls, Mr Johnson is clearly preparing to play the Brexit card again. It would be another defining act of destructive irresponsibility. The large conclusion from the Northern Ireland election is the opposite one. It is that most people want the parties to form a government and resume power-sharing. That is what the success of Sinn Féin, the rejection of the DUP and the advance of the Alliance are all saying. It should be the British government’s priority too.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Northern Ireland: a mandate to govern | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/08/the-guardian-view-on-northern-ireland-a-mandate-to-govern
5/9/2022,"Arecord number of voters are heading to the polls on 21 May after Australia recorded the biggest single-day enrolment in history on 18 April, described by the electoral commissioner as a “modern-day democratic miracle”. Some 17.2 million Australians are now enrolled to vote, more than 96% of eligible voters. But a Plan International report released on Monday 9 May has found three quarters of young women voting for the first time don’t feel politics is an equal space for women and people of colour. Of more than 1,000 women between 18 and 24 surveyed, 60% didn’t feel parliament had become safer or more equal in the past 12 months, despite multiple reviews into workplace culture. And more than 80% had never aspired to high office. Guardian Australia spoke to a number of newly enrolled young voters. Here’s what heading to the polls for the first time means to them. The devastating Queensland floods are at the top of Tai’s mind. Currently studying international relations while working part-time, she sees the rising cost of living and the climate crisis as inextricably linked. I live in a rental in St Lucia which historically floods. My street flooded, my whole suburb flooded, our unit had a leak and the second bedroom flooded. After two-and-a-half-months we’ve finally got the floor back. The Liberal party represents me 0%. I want to see action on the climate crisis, not just a vague “net zero by 2050 but maybe not if we can wiggle out of it”. Real action on cost of living, transport, shit everyone has to deal with unless you’re wealthy. In my area the Greens are the ones I feel most represent me because [when] there was flooding my local Greens member was on my street helping to get food to people. There’s not going to be a party who dot to dot represent everything I want, but they seem to care a little bit and share some of my interests. The climate crisis is the biggest issue for me, especially given the flooding that happened a couple months ago. Also, better social services like Medicare and Centrelink. I’ve spoken to a lot of people throughout the pandemic really frustrated with how difficult it is to get help. Getting a rental in general is very hard. Getting things repaired now is like pulling teeth. Politics is front of my mind. A lot of the issues we face are directly linked to politics – public transport, fuel prices being expensive so there aren’t Ubers in my area, finding a house, prices are so high … it’s difficult to save and buy, the way landlords are able to do whatever they want. I see it as directly linked to who’s in power and what their ideals are. Jay has already lodged his postal vote. Despite being excited by local politics in his region, he is frustrated by the electoral process. I think there’s a lot of pride we can take from having an independent [running in my electorate]. I do think there are people in our local government who want to make change and are involved for the right reasons. I was super keen on politics throughout high school and as I got older I got completely turned off. I was thinking of becoming a politician … but the way politicians have to operate and the sacrifices you have to make on what you believe in to be successful is pretty cutthroat. You don’t need to be part of a party to have a voice. It is kind of sad when I’m talking to my friends and they say they wouldn’t vote if they didn’t have to because they’re disillusioned. You have these young people that have great ideas but are choosing not to get involved in politics. I want to look on the TV and see someone representing me and young people don’t necessarily have that right now at a national level. Growing up in the Queensland coastal city of Hervey Bay, small business concerns are a key priority in Lily’s region. But trying to navigate the major parties’ electoral policies has made her feel less certain about who to vote for. I’m supposed to be voting in the upcoming election and honestly feel like I shouldn’t be. I’ve tried researching all the parties and their policies and I’m still extremely confused and overwhelmed … it’s hard to differentiate their policies. I did legal studies through my schooling but even then I feel like you weren’t taught enough about different parties. [In my region], a lot of people around me are owners of small businesses and have a focus on the policies regarding that, rather than the other policies governments offer. Everyone around me is voting similarly but at the same time I don’t want to follow everyone, I want to follow a party because I know it’s the good decision. I did a bit of research into the environment and emissions and all the policies seemed quite similar. I’ve also just started university so I’d be interested in education policies as well. I feel like if politicians were displaying their policies on avenues younger people are more connected with – like better explaining on social media in simpler terms – it would assist in me having a more educated vote. I’m honestly still a little unsure [who I’ll vote for], but maybe Liberal at this point in time. Olivia has lived in Sydney’s beachside suburb Coogee all her life. Currently studying a bachelor of arts law, Olivia is fired up about the election. She says of her friends who aren’t interested in politics, they’re still passionate about one thing – climate change. How [do] I feel about Australia’s current politicians, particularly the ones in power? I can’t say I’m a fan to put it simply. I think Australia is in dire need of a shift within our political sphere. I’m concerned for Australia’s short- and long-term future if our current politicians stay in power for much longer. White Australian middle-aged men are overrepresented in parliament. Issues young people are concerned about often get overlooked. Independents will be really interesting to see [in the election] because more than ever a lot of people seem to be unhappy with both Liberal and Labor. Climate change is a no-brainer [issue] particularly for people my age. My friends that don’t know a lot about politics are passionate about climate change. Other than that, I think policies on healthcare and employment and government support are really big. The Centrelink process is really difficult, there’s a lot of blockages and it’s hard to access financial support. I have friends who gave up even trying to get Centrelink because it’s too complicated. And housing – I have a few friends who feel there’s no support in that area and it’s a bit of a grim outlook on the future when you don’t know what’s going to happen.

5/9/2022,"As the election campaign gathers pace before polling day, voters that are unable to reach ballot boxes on 21 May are now able to cast their vote early. From Monday, more than 500 voting centres across the country will begin operation, and anyone unable to vote on election day can walk into a prepolling centre and cast their vote. We answer six common questions about how prepolling works. No, you can walk into any early voting centre. The Australian Electoral Commission has a list of the more than 500 early voting centres. Most centres operate from 8am to 6pm, however some will have extended hours. Several Australian embassies and diplomatic missions are also hosting early voting centres. No. You can cast your vote at any early voting centre (provided you haven’t already voted). In short, you’re the judge of your own eligibility for early voting. The AEC commissioner, Tom Rogers, said Australians should still consider elections as “in-person events”, where “once every three years the country comes together in a transparent and secure environment to have their say”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “If you can vote on election day then that’s what you should do,” Rogers said. “However, if your circumstances might prevent you from doing that then you need to think about the early voting options available, and vote according to your circumstances.” Yes. The AEC will have dedicated hygiene officers to regularly sanitise surfaces and pencils at all AEC early voting centres, and social distancing will be enforced. Queues will also be controlled to ensure safe distancing. According to the AEC website, “voters do not need to be vaccinated to attend a voting centre and campaign activities (including handing out how-to-vote cards) can occur, in line with local health directions and electoral laws”. No. You can apply for postal voting if you’re unable to get to a polling place on election day. The AEC has already been accepting postal voting registrations, and it encourages those hoping to vote by post to apply as soon as possible, especially for overseas voters. Postal voters must complete their ballots on or before election day, and are urged to return it as soon as possible.

5/9/2022,"A Melbourne man convicted of murder more than a decade ago is launching a new appeal, arguing that a co-accused who was acquitted was responsible for the death and has confirmed he was not involved. Khalid Baker’s lawyers will argue this week that fresh and compelling evidence shows he has been the victim of a substantial miscarriage of justice and his conviction must be overturned. In 2005, Baker, 18, was at a party in a converted warehouse when an altercation occurred. During the altercation, a man named Albert Snowball toppled through a window and fell more than five metres to the ground. He died two days later in hospital. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Baker and a co-accused, who was 17 at the time and cannot be named but is known as LM, were alleged to have attacked Snowball, punching and pushing him until he was forced backwards through the window. Baker was convicted of Snowball’s murder in 2008, and sentenced to 17 years in prison, with a non-parole period of 12 years. Subsequent appeals to the Victorian court of appeal and the high court were unsuccessful, as was a petition for mercy to the state attorney general. Baker spent 13 years in prison but was released in 2018. Lawyers for Baker will this week front a new application for leave to appeal in the Victorian court of appeal, arguing that fresh and compelling evidence exists in the case. It is expected the appeal will focus on the evidence of LM and two new witnesses. LM has provided a sworn affidavit clearing Baker of any involvement in the death and confirming he was nowhere near the window when Snowball fell. According to the new witnesses, LM gave them a similar account of the altercation, clearing Baker of any involvement in the death, in the weeks immediately after it occurred. The new witnesses are a father and son who have known LM and Baker for more than two decades. Neither LM nor Baker gave evidence at trial. The only evidence was the eyewitness accounts of other people at the party. Admissions of guilt made by LM prior to the trial were ruled inadmissible, a claim upheld by the high court. Changes to the Evidence Act since this ruling means it is likely they would now be admissible. The crown is expected to oppose Baker’s appeal, arguing that while the evidence is new, it all relates to accounts given by LM, who they claim is unreliable. Media reporting on the case since Baker’s release is expected to feature heavily in the appeal. In 2018, LM told the ABC “it should have been me” who went to jail in relation to Snowball’s death, not Baker. “Do I feel that I murdered him? No, I don’t feel that. Was it an accident? 100%,” LM said. “It was not Khalid that did it; 100% it was not him.” The following year, LM told 60 Minutes: “I feel responsible for it, definitely. I was the last person that was fighting him.” LM also said during the same interview that he had turned to drugs since the death, which the crown is expected to argue goes to his reliability as a witness. Baker, a promising boxer at the time of the death, has since resumed his career, remaining undefeated in eight fights after winning his most recent bout last month. Baker’s application is one of only a handful made under Victorian right to appeal laws, which were introduced in 2019 to provide a further path for convictions to be overturned in cases involving a substantial miscarriage of justice. Under previous laws, once all rights of appeal had been exhausted, a petition for mercy had to be filed to the state’s attorney general.",News/Australia news,Melbourne boxer convicted of 2005 murder launches new appeal,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/09/melbourne-boxer-convicted-of-2005-launches-new-appeal
5/9/2022,"On those rare occasions when things aren’t going Dustin Martin’s way on the football field, he repeats three words to himself: Strong. Aggressive. Unstoppable. It’s staggering, really. He has all the talent, all the medals, and all the money in the world. An entire football club was built around him. An entire competition was unable to lay a glove on him. He had an oaken constitution, and the perfect physique for his sport. Even in the ad breaks, he was swanning about in his underwear, seemingly without a care in the world. Turns out he was like so many of us – riven by anxiety, propping himself up, blocking out the noise. Though it’s hard to imagine two more different men, one is reminded of an old Paul Keating quote. “Underneath it all, I’m really scared. My knees are knocking. I’m like a bowl of warm spaghetti.” Martin began the 2021 season being talked about in the same breath as Matthews, Carey and Ablett. He finished it on the boundary line at the Gabba, in child’s pose, being misdiagnosed by the physicians at Channel 7. If you’ve played footy at any level, it was one of those incidents where you thank Christ you’ve hung up the boots. Kidneys don’t take kindly to laceration. He spent a week in hospital, subsisting on bananas, dates and YouTube clips. He lost about two stone. By year’s end, he was mourning his dad. At 30, there was a very real chance he was lost to football. The gossip columnists licked their chops. But the club, and football fans generally, gave him space. He owed the game nothing. There was nothing more to achieve, or prove. On Saturday however, he was back. As always, he didn’t exactly present like a man whose knees were knocking. As always, there was a certain insouciance, a hint of menace. He looked like he’d spent the last month squatting and scowling. He doesn’t get out of bed to play Gold Coast at the Docklands in front of 9,000 desperados on a weekday night. This was more like it. A red-ball game on a Saturday afternoon. A proper rivalry. A fixture with real weight. The Collingwood coach says his charges are eight dates into a relationship, whilst the Tigers are married with three kids. The Pies have limitations on every line, but they’re an honest side always looking to attack. There’s no dinky, sideways action anymore. Some of kids they’re pinning their future on are a bit like Dusty in his younger, dumber, full-throttled days. Martin himself now possesses an innate sense of when to turn up the wick and when to dial it back; of what moment is important, and what is inconsequential. His game oscillates between the savage and the surgical – a 90-degree pass here, an interventionist’s appearance in a melee there, a martial art shove to the windpipe when required. But every time Collingwood threatened, Dusty stood a little more erect - step out of my way, young upstarts, this is my moment, my arena, my competition. The player of the match was Tom Lynch. But it was Dusty’s day. Following his first goal, after his teammates had finally demobbed, he slapped the black tape on his lower deltoid. Dusty is loathe to let us in. But his talent, and even his grief, were on full display. You have to strain a bit harder to see the doubt. But it’s there, apparently. As hard as it is to believe, when Dusty swaggers down to the goal-square, he’s muttering bromides to himself. It gives hope to the rest us. It’s probably scant consolation for the poor bloke manning him. When the MCG is heaving on a Saturday afternoon, the other fixtures tend to recede. Further up the eastern seaboard, the Swans again succumbed to the Suns, GWS barely gave a yelp in Canberra and the Eagles didn’t have a prayer in Brisbane. But there was a lot at stake at the Docklands. The Bombers spent the best part of the evening doing what they’d done all year – fluffing about, playing polite, short-back-and-sided football, sending their supporters spare. All year, there’s been no spark, no point of difference, no depth, no luck. There’s been the usual schadenfreude, for Essendon is always a polarising club. There’s been immense pressure on the coach. It’s been hard not to feel for Ben Rutten. He’s affable, well paid and highly regarded for his footy smarts. But sometimes you look at coaches under the pump and you think, why would you bother? He has to keep a bloodthirsty media at bay. He has to somehow placate and engage a supporter base that’s at the end of its tether. He has to get his players to defend at a team, and find their inner mongrel. At three-quarter-time, his cause looked hopeless. He had Keating’s spaghetti legs. Team, coach and club were all on their final warning. Half an hour later, he was on the boundary line, laughing his lungs out. Maybe they’d started reciting Dusty’s mantras. Maybe they’d finally learnt how to tackle. Maybe Hawthorn simply wasn’t much chop. The Bombers rattled on seven unanswered goals. The club suddenly had a pulse, and a hell of a weight off its back.",Sport/Sport,Dustin Martin owed AFL nothing but his Richmond return had everything,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/09/dustin-martin-owed-afl-nothing-but-his-richmond-return-had-everything
5/9/2022,"Heavy rain over large swathes of Queensland this week could spark flash flooding, with the same wet weather system bringing less intense but prolonged showers to Sydney for up to five days. The Bureau of Meteorology has said western and inland parts of Queensland, as well as the tropical far north, will receive the most rain. Totals could reach 250mm in some areas and pose a prolonged flood risk for areas of the state that are already on flood watch, particularly in the south. “We’re already seeing some showers in the area, and this will increase on Monday and peak in the middle of the week, with the heaviest falls between Tuesday and Thursday,” Miriam Bradbury, a forecaster at the BoM, said. “Generally the daily falls will be between 50mm to 100mm, but there are also thunderstorms predicted throughout Queensland and because of them we can really quickly see the rainfall totals get much higher,” she said. “It’s the thunderstorms that can exacerbate the risk of flooding, and both flash flooding and riverine flooding are quite possible with this system.” The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the government and agencies would be monitoring the rain event “very carefully”. “It’s very unusual to see this type of situation occurring in far north Queensland, especially this time of year which is usually near the end of the season,” she said on Friday. “We are expecting higher rainfall totals than we’ve seen before in May.” Bradbury said that a trough across parts of Queensland and northern New South Wales, and a high pressure system sitting over the Tasman sea, are interacting to create the prolonged and intense rain. “Between them they’re squeezing all of this moisture down from the tropics and pushing into these parts of Queensland and down into NSW,” she said. “We also have an upper trough in the atmosphere providing a lot of support which has the potential to make the system more intense.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning For Sydney, Bradbury said the weather system will result in “a bit of a showery period”, which would begin with lighter falls on Monday and also peak between Tuesday and Thursday, before becoming drier as the system moves east off the coast over the weekend. She said rainfall totals in Sydney are predicted to be between 15mm to 25mm during the peak of the wet weather. “By and large, the main intense and dangerous rain activity will be inland and in Queensland, but New South Wales will also be wet,” she said. “Things should ease by next weekend as the system moves east, but because of river rises, the flood impact could continue past the weekend.” Bradbury said that for parts of Queensland, “I don’t know how much help an umbrella will be” and that instead, residents should have a flood plan ready.

5/9/2022,"Attack ads targeting Labor are being published without any authorisation or party attribution on the Chinese-language social networking platform, WeChat, raising concerns that misinformation could be circulating without oversight. The advertisements, which include false suggestions Labor’s policies involve a raft of new taxes, appear on the WeChat site of Chinese-language media outlet Australian Financial News, alongside highly flattering articles about the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg. The Commonwealth Electoral Act requires paid electoral advertisements to be authorised, with a breach of the Act attracting a penalty of up to $26,650. But the Australian Electoral Commission said it is “not proactively monitoring WeChat in this election”. Australians of Chinese heritage could play a pivotal role in the outcome of the election, as they have in previous years, especially as Australia’s fraught relationship with China becomes a central talking point of the campaign. As several marginal seats in Sydney and Melbourne with large Chinese-Australian populations hang in the balance, courting the community has become essential. A volunteer-run campaign against Labor conducted on WeChat during the 2016 election is thought to have been instrumental flipping the Labor-held seat of Chisholm to Liberal MP Julia Banks. During the 2019 campaign, Labor complained to WeChat about a high volume of misleading anti-Labor material, some of which could be traced back to Liberal Party members. One doctored tweet, purporting to come from then ALP leader Bill Shorten’s account, said: “Immigration of people from the Middle East is the future Australia needs.” The attack ads that appeared in April are designed in the same style as the Liberal party’s election ads, but without the required authorisation tagline. The ads feature an unflattering picture of opposition leader Anthony Albanese and list in Chinese a range of taxes. “Coal emission tax, traffic tax, retirement taxes, family business taxes and inheritance taxes,” the ads say in Chinese, with big crosses marked next to them. None of these taxes is current ALP policy. There are about 3 million users of WeChat in Australia; Australian Financial News is a mid-tier site, with stories attracting between 10,000 to 20,000 readers. The site also features a video ad supporting Frydenberg’s campaign featuring the treasurer’s dry cleaner, Eddie, who is of Chinese descent, saying how important jobkeeper was to his business during the Covid-19 crisis. This ad carries the required authorisation. Accompanying the ads are highly flattering news stories about Frydenberg, which have appeared on multiple websites. A spokesperson for Frydenberg’s campaign said they had paid for banner advertisements on Australian Financial News promoting the Morrison government’s economic record and plan for a stronger future. They said they had not paid for the soft editorial that accompanied them. “Information on Anthony Albanese’s record of supporting higher taxes on Australians has also been featured through banner advertising,” the spokesperson said, but did not address the lack of authorisation. Authorities and campaigns have been on the lookout for “fake news” circulating on social media emanating from political rivals and state-sponsored actors, but the damage can often be wrought before the parties become aware of it. The ABC has uncovered highly misleading posts recently spreading on WeChat, depicting a shadowy image of a spy figure and claims that eight Chinese figures who support Labor are under investigation for election interference by the “Australian Intelligence Bureau”. There is no such agency in Australia. The post, written in Chinese, was reportedly circulated by a group of Liberal party supporters to more than a dozen closed WeChat groups, reaching thousands of Chinese-speaking voters in marginal seats in Australia’s east coast cities. The AEC said it takes a graduated approach to enforcement, noting that most authorisation matters can be technical in nature. “We monitor a range of social media channels but are not proactively monitoring WeChat this election,” the AEC spokesperson said. “The vast majority of authorisations matters are brought to our attention swiftly by other social media users and political participants (we are not lacking in people who refer content to us to review).” But the real risk is likely to come in the coming weeks, as it did in the 2019 campaign, through “fake news” being spread via private WeChat chat groups, which are difficult to monitor. Fergus Ryan, a senior analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s International Cyber Policy Centre, said the most effective strategy to spread election messaging would be for “supporters and their proxies to use their own personal accounts to feed material into WeChat groups, because that’s where the activity takes place. It’s similar to WhatsApp groups.” Chinese-Australian media have reported a high level of interest in the 2022 campaign among readers after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, stepped up his rhetoric about the importance of protecting Australia’s national security, while his defence minister, Peter Dutton, warned Australia should prepare for war with China. Whether this will translate into a rush towards Labor remains to be seen, but the community will likely play a critical role in a raft of vigorously contested seats: Chisholm, Deakin and Kooyong in Victoria, and Reid, Parramatta, Banks, North Sydney and Bennelong in NSW. Martin Ma is the editor-in-chief of Sydney Today/Melbourne Today, which is among the most popular and influential Chinese-language online publications in Australia. “The [Australia-China] relationship is one of the most important [issues] in the election among the community,” Ma said. “The prevailing view is that we should protect Australian values but that doesn’t mean we have to fight straight against China. Most of our audience are first-generation migrants from mainland China. People love their hometown, they don’t want to see conflicts between Australia and China.” While online polls can be manipulated through multiple voting by people with vested interests, and they do not adjust for demographics who are not regularly online, a recent Sydney Today poll showed that in early voting 77% of respondents were favouring Labor, and nearly half said they would change their vote this time. The poll has been running since 29 April. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Of the respondents, 14% said Australia’s relationship with China was important to their vote, ahead of economic management at 13%. Over 58% wanted to see an Australia-China policy of “seeking common ground while respecting differences to improve bilateral relations”, as opposed to only 10% support for the current stance of “abiding by Australia’s interests”. Sydney Today has been publishing regular stories about the election that it considers relevant to its audience. Many stories are translations of articles from English-language media or compilations of articles. “We stand in the middle and let people hear the voices from different sides. We have been interviewing Chinese-Australians and asking them how they vote,” Ma said. “We did a piece with nine people on the street by random: four supporting Labor, five Liberal. I think this election is going to be a close competition according to the representation of the community – there are different views.”",News/Australia news,Unattributed attack ads targeting Labor on Chinese-language WeChat fuel fears of misinformation,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/09/unattributed-attack-ads-targeting-labor-on-chinese-language-wechat-fuel-fears-of-misinformation
5/9/2022,"Iused to dream of owning a home with a library like the one in Beauty and the Beast. A ladder that glides along the impossibly high shelves filled with more books than you could read in 10 lifetimes. That was before I understood that the idea that you would have one house that you were able to live in for many years (and god forbid, add shelving) would itself be a fairytale.

I do not wish to rid myself of every book, but I no longer wish to keep every book. At some point, I crossed the line from reader to hoarder and I need to go back. These are the books that do not pass the Marie Kondo test. These books spark no joy. If anything, the many bookmarks still stuck less than halfway through them conjure embarrassment. I know I’m never going back to finish them. They know I’m never going back to finish them. It is time to end this charade. But coming to terms with this psychologically is only part of the battle. There’s now a bigger and much more practical question: what do you do with books you don’t want any more? No one has prepared me for this. There doesn’t seem to be an easy answer. The traditional response seems to be offloading them on to a charity shop but that feels gross. Why should they be burdened with my problem? I already know these aren’t good books! All I would be doing is hoping someone else will be fooled the way I was fooled.

5/9/2022,"High-achieving students who want to become teachers will be given at least $10,000 a year to study education under a Labor plan to improve teacher quality. Under the policy, to be announced on Monday, 5,000 students with an Atar of 80 or more will receive the scholarship to study an education degree, with an extra $2,000 bonus a year for those who teach in a regional area. Labor will aim to double the number of high achievers studying to become teachers over the next decade, from about 1,800 to 3,600 a year. The package will cost $146.5m over four years, and includes an extra 1,500 places in high achieving teachers’ programs. That will include 700 places in Teach for Australia and 60 in La Trobe’s Nexus program, effectively doubling a $40m commitment by the Coalition to create that number of places in those courses. Labor is concerned just 3.3% of high achievers with an Atar over 80 choose teaching, down from about 30% three decades ago. Education degrees are already among the cheapest offered at Australian universities, with a maximum cost of $3,985 after the Coalition’s jobs ready graduate reforms slashed $3,000 off the cost to the student. Under the scholarship plan, graduates will be required to teach for at least three years in public schools. The bonus of $2,000 is payable for each year a student does a placement in a regional area. The $10,000 scholarship was proposed by the Grattan Institute in a 2019 report which found that doubling the number of high achievers studying teaching could help the average student gain an extra six to 12 months of learning by year 9. The report also called for performance pay for teachers, with “master” teachers able to earn up to $80,000 more than their peers. Labor’s policy said it would work with states and territories to make sure teachers have a better career path with more opportunities to be “rewarded as experts, and to pass on their skills to other teachers without having to leave classroom teaching”. “This could mean higher pay and more responsibility for elite teachers working as literacy and numeracy specialists or helping coach early career teachers in the classroom,” it said. “We want to make sure our kids get the best education they can,” Anthony Albanese said. “That means we have to make sure they get the best quality teaching.” The shadow education minister, Tanya Plibersek, said: “One of the most important things we can do to stop the slide in students’ results and boost student results is to lift teaching standards.” “I want students competing to get into teaching like they do to get into medicine or law,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning If elected, Labor will design safeguards in consultation with the education department, such as adding the cost of the scholarship to students’ Hecs debts if they choose a different career, with a pro rata reduction for each year they do teach. The 1,500 high achieving teachers program places will allow qualified professionals in other fields, such as mathematicians and scientists, to retrain as teachers by employing them as part-time teachers’ aides while they do an intensive master’s degree in education. Those places are on top of 20,000 extra university places already promised by Labor. Last Wednesday the acting education minister, Stuart Robert, announced the Coalition’s plan to lift teacher quality which included $13.4m to create a one-year graduate diploma of education to help professionals become teachers, $10.8m for phonics and quality teaching programs and $7.2m for professional resources.",News/Australia news,Labor to announce scholarship plan for high-achieving students to become teachers,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/09/labor-to-announce-scholarship-plan-for-high-achieving-students-to-become-teachers
