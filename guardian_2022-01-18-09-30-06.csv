1/18/2022,"The House of Lords has voted to make misogyny a hate crime in England and Wales, in a night of several defeats for the government in the upper chamber. The law change would enable judges to impose stronger penalties if prejudice against women is proved to be the motivation, and would also require the police to record whether crimes were motivated by a hatred of someone’s sex or gender.  In October, Boris Johnson rejected the idea that misogyny should be a hate crime, saying: “If you simply widen the scope of what you ask the police to do, you’ll just increase the problem.” The justice secretary, Dominic Raab, also dismissed the suggestion while appearing confused about the meaning of misogyny, suggesting it could apply to the abuse of women or men. The Home Office minister Lady Williams pointed to a report by the Law Commission last year which concluded that making misogyny a hate crime would not prevent hostility towards women, but the amendment passed anyway on Monday night, thanks to support from Labour and the Liberal Democrats, with 242 peers backing it versus 185 voting against. The vote came during a debate in the House of Lords on the Police Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, in which the government lost 13 divisions, including plans to make people locking themselves on to objects punishable by up to 51 weeks’ imprisonment, suspicion-less stop-and-search and introduction of “serious disruption prevention orders” against protesters. Peers also voted to block proposals to give police new powers to stop noisy and disruptive protests in England and Wales, with Green peer Jenny Jones calling the plans “oppressive” and “plain nasty”. Once the Lords have completed their scrutiny of the bill, which needs the approval of both houses to become law, it will return to the House of Commons. In December, the Law Commission, an independent body that recommends legal changes for England and Wales, decided to reject a proposal to make misogyny a hate crime after it concluded that the move would not solve the “real problem” of hostility or prejudice directed against women because of their sex or gender. Instead, it recommended that the government consider introducing a specific offence to tackle public sexual harassment, which it claimed would be more effective. The drive to amend the bill to make misogyny a hate crime was led by the Conservative peer Lady Newlove, a former victims’ commissioner. Newlove said: “It is perverse that, despite 3 million crimes being committed against women in just three years, our legal and policing systems do not routinely recognise what we all know is blindingly obvious: the deep-rooted hostility towards women that motivates many of these crimes. “As a society we have rightly taken steps to acknowledge the severity of racist or homophobic crimes, but have not yet acted on crimes driven by hatred of women. “Too often when it comes to violence against women, society demands the perfect victim before we act,” she stressed, adding that her amendment was an attempt to “flip the script”. Lady Fox, and independent, argued against the proposal, warning that the collected data would be “almost entirely based on subjective perceptions” of what constituted misogyny. Labour’s Lord Hain called the government’s plan to curb noisy protests via extended police powers “the biggest threat to the right to dissent and the right to protest in my lifetime”. Williams defended the government’s plans, telling peers that the police would only use the powers where “necessary” and “appropriate”, before the amendment won by 261 votes to 166. Adding to a raft of government defeats, peers also supported four other amendments including one aiming to protect Parliament Square as a place to protest, one that would require police officers to tell the truth in public inquiries, and one demanding an inquiry into the prevalence of drink-spiking offences.",News/World news,Government defeated as Lords vote to make misogyny a hate crime,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/18/government-defeated-as-lords-vote-to-make-misogyny-a-hate
1/18/2022,"Perhaps one of the scant benefits of the dearth of A-League Men fixtures being staged at present is that it offers plenty of opportunities for introspection and pontification. Such is in the fluid nature of Australian football the potential topics are legion but, two months into ALM’s latest brave new era and with a nascent sample size to call upon, mayhaps a particular existential question bears examination: just what constitutes a good game of A-Leagues football? And, in determining that, what are the pros and cons of such a lens?  Take, for example, the only two games that were able to be staged across the league in what was nominally round nine of the campaign last week: Melbourne Victory against Adelaide United on Saturday evening and Melbourne City against Western Sydney Wanderers on Sunday afternoon. Inevitably, the revelations from United’s Josh Cavallo – that he was subjected to homophobic abuse during the former – casts an inescapable pall but, before their reveal, initial reaction to the game was positive. Nicholas D’Agostino and Craig Goodwin provided two goal-of-the-season candidates, Isaías’s red card and a disallowed goal added a dash of controversy, and its conclusion was marked by chaotic end-to-end football as two rivals played for the badge. That this apotheosis was preceded by nearly 90 minutes of the footballing equivalent of the Ludovico Technique – D’Agostino’s 84th minute-thunderbolt was the first time either side put a shot on target – felt beside the point. In an age of social media clips, rambunctious headlines and an established football media too small to consistently offer in-depth coverage, a chaotic crescendo was seemingly enough to earn a passing grade. Conversely, in City’s 3-3 draw with the Wanderers, storyline factors served to supplement, not supplant, the action on the pitch and their potential ramifications. With Wanderers coach Carl Robinson confined to a hotel, the external narrative of his tenuous tenure was blunted and, perhaps due to this, the thrust and parry of the contest shone through. Be it Steven Ugarkovic pulling the strings, Marco Tilio’s immediate game-changing introduction off the bench, Keijiro Ogawa giving the Wanderers a new dimension at the top of their attack, or both sides being forced to come from behind, the football was the star of the show at AAMI Park. The late VAR drama surrounding a potential handball on Rostyn Griffiths felt like it came to the detriment of the game, rather than finally providing something by which to remember it. Stepping back, both archetypes took vastly different journeys to produce ‘good’ games. But is one better than the other? Not really. What road one prefers is, at its heart, an ideological preference; a battle of perceived style against perceived substance. And while individual predilection will be governed which side of the spectrum one falls upon, the theatregoer or the footballing intransigent, both the yin and the yang have their place in ALM – even if the former has been disproportionately represented thus far in 2021-22. With more technically sound leagues out there, the majority of ALM observers largely do so out of an emotional connection to the league and/or one of its clubs. In this scenario, the narratives, pride, atmosphere or result are what keep them coming back week in and week out. It is Australia’s league, and despite what follows the protection of this uniqueness is still the most important thing facing the game. But much like the perils of staring into the ‘Peak A-League’ abyss, an unquestioning embrace of the boom crash opera risks coming at the expense of a level of expectation for ALM sides to demonstrate some level of innovation and functionality. At what point does the latest round of recycled, horseshoe possession that develops because a team was denied transition become grating? And at what point does the play of the national team and the grassroots begin to suffer by osmosis from a premier domestic league wherein ‘passion’ takes precedence over function (if it hasn’t already happened)? One cannot legislate an improvement in playing style. To do so is to remove player and coach agency and the essence of what makes football, football. Evolution will likely be delivered by a rise in external expectations forcing those whose job it is to ultimately deliver an improved on-field product – predominantly coaches, football departments and club executives – to rise to the challenge lest they alienate those whose eyeballs they covet. At present,advanced statistics and authoritative language are frequently enough to pass as an expert regardless of the validity of one’s conclusions or underlying logic. But because there is a dearth in demand, it is not an aspect of coverage being flooded with enough options that will allow the cream to rise to the top. Further, the act of actively educating its audience is a difficult and thankless task in a market where football is a subservient code, where the cons often outweigh the benefits. Growing the game and potential audience will help with this but, in a crowded market, be initially driven by narrative and storylines providing a hook to get a critical mass of punters through the door. It is easier said than done, but it is a level of introspection which is important for ALM.",Sport/Football,What constitutes a good game of A-Leagues football | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/18/what-constitutes-a-good-game-of-a-leagues-football
1/18/2022,"Motorists across the whole of London could be charged for every journey from 2024 under plans being drawn up to reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality. The mayor, Sadiq Khan, said London should be a global leader in introducing smart road pricing, as a report found car journeys in the capital needed to be cut by more than a quarter to meet net zero emissions targets by 2030.  Khan said air pollution and the climate emergency were “an issue of social justice across the globe – and in London as well, it’s the poorest Londoners, the least likely to own a car, who suffer the consequences”. He has asked Transport for London (TfL) to explore road pricing that would charge by distance travelled, time and location. However, with technology to operate a scheme unlikely to be ready soon, he has told TfL to consider other options to make drivers pay for polluting before the end of his second term in office in May 2024. Possible options include a daily clean air charge for all car journeys throughout Greater London, or applying the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) £12.50 daily charge to all petrol and diesel cars rather than just older models. TfL will also consider expanding the Ulez as it currently operates throughout all boroughs and introducing a boundary charge to drive into Greater London. Fully electric and other zero-emission cars would be exempt under all options. Khan said he would like to see both the London congestion charge – introduced in 2003 – and the Ulez replaced with road pricing before the end of the decade: “Both schemes are quite blunt and technology has moved on. I want London to be a global leader.” The mayor said he wanted to start “an earnest conversation with Londoners” about ways to reduce car use, ease congestion and cut levels of air pollution – so high last Friday that people were advised not to exercise outdoors. Jemima Hartshorn, of the campaign group Mums for Lungs, said it was “a good day for London’s kids”. However, motoring organisations warned the proposals could “punish” people who relied on their cars and urged the mayor to rethink. The RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said the proposals “would create massive financial challenges for individuals, families and businesses who run a car in London and even for those who visit the fringes of the capital … and will punish those who simply cannot afford an electric car”. Some proposals would require government backing to extend powers and funding, while legislation would be required to enable a boundary charge for drivers entering Greater London. The area covered by the ultra-low emission zone, whose boundary expanded only in October from central London to the north and south circular roads, could be more than doubled. Extending its scope to newer vehicles would also affect far more motorists in the area where it currently applies: about 90% of vehicles in the expanded zone, where 3.8 million live and work, are currently not charged, as most petrol cars less than 15 years old and the newest diesels are exempt. Only 2% of vehicles on London roads are electric. An additional daily charge throughout London – comparable to the price of a single fare on public transport – is another option. Khan said it would be a “nudge” to car owners, “something that make it worthwhile to take a bus rather than jump in a car”. According to TfL, a third of car journeys in the capital can be walked in less than 25 minutes, and two-thirds cycled in less than 20. Achieving net zero by 2030 would need a 27% cut in car journeys – and still require billions to be spent offsetting London’s emissions, according to a report by consultancy Element Energy commissioned by Khan and published on Tuesday. While the ambition to cut London’s emissions will also tackle home insulation and offices, Khan said he was focusing on transport, which had been slow to decarbonise – reducing emissions by just 7% between 2000 and 2018, compared with a 57% reduction from workplaces and 40% from homes. Smart charging could take into account distance travelled, locations, public transport alternatives, the time of day, as well as how polluting a vehicle was, Khan said, with exemptions and discounts for those on low incomes and with disabilities, and support for charities and small businesses. Transport for London is seeking long-term funding support from the government after losing billions in fare revenue as tube journeys in particular fell during the pandemic. Proposals for a boundary charge to raise funds were initially rebuffed by ministers.",News/UK news,Sadiq Khan proposes journey charge for motorists in London,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/18/sadiq-khan-proposes-journey-charge-for-motorists-in-london
1/18/2022,"Social media stars including Jodie Marsh and five ex-Love Islanders including Francesca Allen are to be subjected to a name and shame Instagram campaign by the UK’s advertising watchdog for continuing to flout social media marketing rules. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), which issued a final warning to 122 UK-based Instagram influencers over repeatedly failing to tell followers when they were paid to promote products in posts, has resorted to using the social media platform to highlight their behaviour to users.  The ASA has created personalised ads that name the social influencers – Marsh, Allen, twins Jess and Eve Gale, Belle Hassan and Anna Vakili – stating that they have been sanctioned for not declaring paid posts to followers and pointing to a webpage listing all of those who “break these rules”. On Tuesday, Love Island winner Amber Rose Gill was added to the ASA’s non-compliance webpage, although she is not part of the targeted Instagram ad campaign. “For the minority of influencers that repeatedly fail to disclose their paid-for posts, it’s important their social media followers are told,” said Shahriar Coupal, director of advertising policy and practice at the ASA. “In a new front of enforcement activity, we’re using targeted ads to highlight the breaches of six social media personalities to the very same audience they are seeking to influence.” The ASA, which is running the targeted campaign for an initial two weeks to assess whether the ads have an impact on the behaviour of the influencers, has not ruled out further potential sanctions. “When we see the necessary changes to their disclosure practices, we’ll call off the ads,” said Coupal. “But, where non-compliance persists, we’ll look to more direct forms of enforcement.” Social media influencers who continue to break the non-disclosure rules could be referred to Trading Standards or the Competition and Markets Authority, which has the ability to impose fines. The watchdog has also previously said it could also work with social media companies “to have their content removed”. Under the UK advertising code, promotional posts must clearly indicate they are paid-for endorsements, typically using the hashtag #ad, short for advertising. In 2019, the CMA secured formal commitments from 16 celebrities, including Alexa Chung and Ellie Goulding, to clearly state if they have been paid or receive any gifts when publishing posts on Instagram.",News/Media,Love Islanders to be named and shamed for not declaring paid-for posts,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/18/love-islanders-to-be-named-and-shamed-for-not-declaring-paid-for-posts
1/18/2022,"Thousands of student gambling addicts are spending an average of £30 a week on betting, racking up debts and missing out on university life to fund their habit, research has found. In a survey of 2,000 students, 80% said they gambled, with 35% of those who did admitting using their student loan, bank overdrafts, borrowing from friends or taking out payday loans.  Of those who gambled, 41% said it had led to them missing lectures, assignment deadlines or social activities. There are about 2.5 million students in the UK, indicating that hundreds of thousands are suffering financial or social harm due to gambling. Students reported spending £31.52 on betting in a week on average, while almost 20% admitted to spending more than £50. They were asked how much they spent on gambling, without a distinction being made between deposits and losses. The most popular product was the National Lottery (32%), including casino-style instant win smartphone games, followed by online sports betting (25%) and online bingo (18%). The report, by the YGAM youth gambling charity and Gamstop, the national tool for gamblers who want to bar themselves from online betting and gaming, built on previous research that found that 88,000 students have a problem. Martin Jones’ son, Josh, took his own life in 2015 after becoming addicted to gambling while doing his A-levels and later getting into financial difficulty at university. “He went up to halls of residence and within 10 days he’d blown his first term’s loan, which was about £1,200,” said Jones. Jones and his wife, Kim, ended up having to manage their son’s finances for the duration of his time studying maths at the University of Surrey. He got a job with the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers shortly after leaving university but was unable to escape the gambling addiction. He took his own life aged 23 after running up debts of £30,000. Bray Ash, 29, who is studying mental health nursing at King’s College London, having previously studied at Leeds University, also blew his student loan. “It took over my life – I wasn’t studying, I was just sitting in my halls gambling,” he said. “[During] my second year of university, I ended up gambling away my student loan in the first 24 hours. “It is important that students have access to organisations, such as YGAM, to educate them about gambling and provide support and that they are aware of essential tools such as self-exclusion if they are experiencing problems with their gambling. I know that it would have benefited me when I was at my lowest point.” A spokesperson for the Betting & Gaming Council (BGC) said the majority of gambling among young people was on scratchcards, the lottery and private betting, not with BGC members. “The BGC also funds the £10m Young People’s Gambling Harm Prevention Programme, delivered by leading charities YGAM and GamCare, which is being delivered to every 11- to 19-year-old in the UK, and those working with them,” said a spokesperson.",News/Society,Thousands of student gambling addicts ‘spending £30 a week on habit’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/18/thousands-of-student-gambling-addicts-spending-30-a-week-on-habit
1/18/2022,"A government-backed campaign has stepped up the pressure on plans by Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook Messenger and Instagram apps to introduce end-to-end encryption, warning that millions of cases of child sex abuse could go undetected. The new campaign warns that social media companies are “willingly blindfolding” themselves to abuse if they implement end-to-end encryption for private messaging.  Although the No Place to Hide campaign does not refer directly to plans for end-to-end encryption on Messenger and Instagram, they were strongly criticised by the home secretary, Priti Patel, last year, who described them as “not acceptable”. The campaign has been launched by abuse survivors, child safety campaigners and charities including Barnardo’s and is funded by the Home Office. Safety campaigners warn that strongly encrypted messaging prevents law enforcement, and tech platforms providing the services, from seeing messages by ensuring that only the sender and recipient can view their content – a process known as end-to-end encryption. The new campaign calls on tech bosses to make a public commitment that they will not offer end-to-end encryption until they ensure any changes do not make it easier for child sex abusers to commit crimes. Rhiannon-Faye McDonald, an abuse survivor and subject matter expert at the Marie Collins Foundation, which supports victims of online child sexual abuse and is part of the steering group for the campaign, said: “When people say this is about privacy, I couldn’t agree more. I have a right to privacy as a survivor of child sexual abuse. My abuse was recorded with photos and videos which may be out there now, as I speak. We want an assurance that E2EE [end-to-end encryption] will not enable and make it easier for child sex abusers to harm children either directly by finding and grooming them, or indirectly by circulating child sexual abuse material.” Meta, the owner of Messenger and Instagram, announced in November that it would delay its plans and would finish global delivery of end-to-end encryption “sometime in 2023”. Meta already uses end-to-end encryption on its WhatsApp messaging service and had been planning to extend that to messaging on Messenger and Instagram in 2022. It has already encrypted voice and video calls on Messenger. The No Place to Hide campaign refers to 2020 data from the ​​National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), a US-based organisation, which showed that Meta’s platforms accounted for 20.3m referrals of child sexual abuse material – 94% of the total in that year. According to NCMEC, 70% of referrals by Meta platforms could be lost under end-to-end encryption, the equivalent of 14m reports. Responding to the new campaign, the global head of safety at Meta, Antigone Davis, said the “overwhelming majority of Brits” rely on end-to-end encryption to protect them from fraudsters, hackers and criminals. “We agree on the need for strong safety measures that work with encryption and are building these into our plans. We’re focused on preventing harm by banning suspicious profiles, restricting adults from messaging children they’re not connected with and defaulting under-18s to private or ‘friends only’ accounts. We’re also encouraging people to report harmful messages to us so we can see the contents, respond swiftly and make referrals to the authorities.”",News/Technology,Campaign aims to stop Facebook encryption plans over child abuse fears,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/18/campaign-aims-to-stop-facebook-encryption-plans-over-child-abuse-fears
1/18/2022,"Magistrates in England and Wales will be given more sentencing powers in an attempt to tackle the backlog of cases waiting to be dealt with by criminal courts. In the latest effort to reduce both the number of outstanding cases and the pressure faced by crown courts during the coronavirus pandemic, magistrates will be able to hand out jail terms of up to a year – double the current maximum.  The Ministry of Justice estimates this could free up almost 2,000 extra days of crown court time a year. The move will allow magistrates to sentence more serious cases they hear, such as fraud, theft and assault. At present, crimes warranting a jail term of more than six months have to be sent to a crown court for sentencing. The move was welcomed by magistrates but barristers said it was “distraction politics at its worst” and would “do nothing to unplug the existing massive backlog of trials”. Keeping more cases in magistrates courts, which have been “less severely affected” by Covid, means crown courts can better focus their resources on tackling the backlog, the MoJ said. The changes, which are expected to come into force in the coming months, will only apply to so-called either-way offences, which can be dealt with by magistrates or crown courts. It will mean defendants can still opt to have their case heard by a jury in a crown court if they wish. An amendment to the judicial review and courts bill will enable the government to reverse the change if needed. Bev Higgs, the national chair of the Magistrates Association, which has campaigned for sentencing powers to be extended, said the organisation was delighted with the announcement, adding: “It is absolutely the right time to realign where cases are heard to ensure a safe, effective, and efficient justice system and this demonstrates great confidence in the magistracy. “I know our members and colleagues will take up this new level of responsibility with pride, professionalism, and integrity and will – as always – strive to deliver the highest quality of justice in their courts.” But Jo Sidhu QC, the chair of the Criminal Bar Association, which represents practising criminal barristers in England and Wales, said: “Increasing magistrates’ sentencing powers will do nothing to unplug the existing massive backlog of trials stuck in the crown court pipeline. “This is distraction politics at its worst. The government seems wilfully blind to the stark reality that hundreds of criminal barristers have left the field in despair due to a quarter century of falling real incomes. That is the reason why victims of serious crime are being denied justice in our crown courts.” She added: “Fiddling with magistrates’ sentencing powers is a betrayal of victims of crime. This is a cynical means of depriving those accused of serious crime from being judged by their peers in our long-established jury system. “Keeping back more cases in the magistrates will in any event only trigger more appeals to the crown court, adding to the long list of cases and divert criminal advocates from tackling the existing pile-up of trials.” Mark Fenhalls QC, the chair of the Bar Council, the lead representative body for barristers in England and Wales, said: “We believe that these changes will simply increase the prison population and put further pressure on the Ministry of Justice budget. This will mean less money available to keep the courts running. “It is also quite possible that the changes may prompt more defendants to elect trial in the crown court, increasing the trial backlog. This would damage the interests of complainants and victims and be counterproductive to everything we are trying to achieve to deliver timely and fair justice.” Last year, Whitehall’s spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, said the criminal courts backlog would “remain a problem for many years” after the number of outstanding cases in the crown courts reached record highs of almost 61,000 and more than 364,000 in magistrates courts before beginning to slowly reduce.",News/UK news,Magistrates will get power to give one-year jail sentences to cut backlog,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/18/magistrates-will-get-power-to-give-one-year-jail-sentences-to-cut-backlog
1/18/2022,"The International Olympic Committee’s new transgender framework has come under fire from medical experts who work for multiple sports federations, including World Athletics, World Triathlon and the International Cycling Union, who say it opens the door to unfair competition in female sport.  In a notable intervention, the scientists warn that IOC’s new guidance – which states there is no need for trans women to lower their testosterone to compete against natal women – ignores the science on sex, gender and performance and focuses mostly on inclusion. The new framework, which also applies to athletes with differences of sex development, such as the South African 800m runner Caster Semenya, is due to be rolled out after next month’s Winter Olympics. It comes amid the high-profile cases of the weightlifter Laurel Hubbard, the first open trans women to compete in an Olympics, and the US trans woman Lia Thomas, who recently set a number of collegiate swimming records. However scientists, who are linked with the International Federation of Sports Medicine and European Federation of Sports Medicine Associations, want the IOC to think again. Writing in the British Medical Journal Open Science & Exercise Medicine, they also point out that the IOC’s new position that there should be “no presumption of performance advantage” for trans women “is in stark contrast with the outcome of the 2015 IOC consensus, the scientific evidence, and the subsequent assessment of numerous sports medicine associations/commissions”. The statement, which is signed by 38 authors, including the head of World Athletics’ medical department, the medical director of cycling’s ruling body the UCI and the chair of World Rowing’s medicine commission, also calls on the IOC to set formal standards, based on competitive fairness and the best available science, for sports to follow. One of the authors, Yannis Pitsiladis, told the Guardian: “We believe this position statement is very important because it will force the IOC to open the debate. Yes, the inclusion of human rights is absolutely essential. But equally important is the inclusion of scientific and medical principles in determining a solution. And the IOC framework is not based on medical and scientific principles.” The scientists argue there is a path to allow trans women to compete in female sport by lowering testosterone. According to Pitsiladis, one way to achieve this is to change rules regarding testosterone depending on the sport, with less emphasis on using medication in events like shooting, and more in collision sports. However other scientists insist there is overwhelming evidence to show there is no way to allow trans women into female sport without sacrificing fairness. They point to recent studies showing that trans women maintain significant advantages from undergoing male puberty even when they subsequently lower testosterone. That was a position also taken by the five UK Sports councils in September. They argued that there was no magic solution which balances the inclusion of trans women in female sport while guaranteeing competitive fairness and safety – and, for the first time, told sports across Britain that they would have to choose which to prioritise.",Sport/Sport,IOC’s new transgender guidance criticised as unfair towards female sport,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/17/iocs-new-transgender-guidance-criticised-as-unfair-towards-female-sport
