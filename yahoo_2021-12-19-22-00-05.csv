12/19/2021,"BURLINGTON, VT — One evening in June 2020, a City Council budget meeting in this college town near the Canadian border stretched past midnight after hundreds of locals had logged on to Zoom to speak. Over nine hours, bleary-eyed councilors heard a message that had rippled across the country in the wake of George Floyd’s death. “Enough performing,” said one citizen. “Defund the Burlington police department.” The council would ultimately pass a resolution that upended the way policing was done in the city. Other cities with similar profiles — majority white college towns — “defunded” their police. Norman, Oklahoma, diverted 4 percent of the police budget to community services. Northampton, Massachusetts, cut 10 percent from the police budget. Burlington, however, decided to slash almost 30 percent of its police force by attrition. Since then, city leaders have been forced to reckon with the unintended consequences of that decision, including problems with public safety and quality of life, according to police and residents. Almost a year and a half later, no one, it seems, is happy. Not even the councilor who proposed the resolution. “We’re in a situation that I think nobody wanted us to get to,” said Councilor Zoraya Hightower, a member of the locally dominant Progressive Party. The mayor, who didn’t support cutting the force, agrees. “There’s a lot of damage that has been done in the last 16 months,” said Mayor Miro Weinberger, a Democrat. Burlington, a city of some 44,000 nestled on the shore of Lake Champlain, is the home of the University of Vermont and a beacon of progressive politics. It’s where Sen. Bernie Sanders launched his political career, and City Council divisions are not between Republicans and Democrats, but Democrats and Progressives. Historically, the city’s property crime rate has been slightly higher than the national average, but the violent crime rate has been lower. The overall number of incidents, meaning calls that bring a police response, has decreased each year since 2016 and the number of high-priority incidents, including violent crimes, makes up less than 10 percent of the total. Prior to defunding and Covid, officers spent a little over half their time on quality-of-life issues such as noise complaints and intoxication. By many measures, Burlington is also home to one of the nation’s most forward-thinking police departments. It’s long prioritized community policing and received praise for its approach to the opioid crisis. Its police chiefs implemented reforms ahead of the curve, from mandating body-worn cameras to cutting ties with a federal program that gives military equipment to police departments. About 74 percent of its current force holds bachelor’s or more advanced degrees — about twice the national average, per a 2017 study. Despite the department’s progressive bona fides, by 2019 it had come under increasing scrutiny from activists after a series of controversies — including use of force incidents involving Black men in a city that is less than six percent black. In September 2018, a Burlington police officer responded to a reported altercation at a bar. Body camera footage shows the officer approach the suspect, a Black man named Jeremie Meli, and immediately knock him to the ground. Meli hits his head on a brick wall and appears to lose consciousness. Meli and his family are suing the city and the police department. Meli’s attorney declined to comment. An investigation by independent investigators deemed the officer’s actions unnecessary and he received internal discipline. For Councilor Ali Dieng, a Black man and a political independent, the incident put race into focus. “If we’re saying there is not racism in policing, this was one example, one clear example,” said Dieng. Since 2015, Blacks who are arrested in Burlington have been slightly more likely to be subjected to use of force. A recent study of Vermont traffic stops shows that from 2014 to 2019, Black drivers were 3.6 times more likely to be searched than white drivers. Acting Police Chief Jon Murad agrees the data is troubling. “There are real racial disparities in policing and even in our numbers here in Burlington,” he said. Burlington has made progress in the disparity in traffic stops in recent years. The change was caused, in part, by marijuana legalization, which eliminated some stops, but also by department guidance discouraging certain discretionary stops. Beginning in 2016 searches have decreased overall, and warning rates for white and Black drivers with a valid license have been roughly equal. “While Burlington PD has been an innovator in some areas it has really dropped the ball in several others,” said Jay Diaz, an attorney with the Vermont ACLU. “Namely, disproportionate use of force with people of color and generally how it operates when it comes to working with young people with disabilities.” In 2016, Burlington police officers fatally shot a man in the midst of a mental health crisis. In 2019, a police officer was punched by a man in crisis and struck back, punching him in the face. The man subsequently died. “The police are not the best social service providers and they would be the first to say so,” said Democratic Councilor Joan Shannon. George Floyd died under the knee of Minnesota police officer Derek Chauvin in May 2020. In Burlington, the reaction was swift. Protestors marched through the city and rallied outside the police department, demanding defunding and termination of officers involved in past use-of-force incidents. “We had all these issues leading up to the pandemic, and leading up to the murder of George Floyd,” said Hightower, who is the first Black woman to serve on the Burlington City Council. “For us, it wasn’t just a national problem. It was a problem here at home.” On the one-month anniversary of Floyd’s death, Hightower proposed a resolution called Racial Justice Through Economic and Criminal Justice. She had been elected to the City Council just three months earlier. Her victory helped the Progressive Party achieve a plurality on the council, with six of 12 seats. Several aspects of the resolution Hightower proposed were written not by her, but by an activist group called the Vermont Racial Justice Alliance. The Alliance’s executive director, Mark Hughes, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Requests to current board members were not returned. On June 12, 2020, the Alliance had published a letter to the City Council on its website, demanding an apology and reparations for Burlington’s role in chattel slavery, and a restructuring of public safety, including, among other items, an immediate 30 percent reduction in police officers. Hightower’s resolution included three of the Alliance’s seven suggestions. It also included a modified version of the 30 percent reduction, stating that a decrease from 105 to 74 officers, or a cut of 29.5 percent, should happen through attrition instead of immediately. Officers would be allowed to leave on their own accord over an unspecified period of time. The resolution also ended the school resource officer program and called for the diversion of police funding to social and racial justice initiatives. It said that money saved should be spent on alternative means of providing public safety. It also directed the creation of a committee that would review “how to build a healthy and safe community and what institutions we need to reach that goal,” including an inquiry into the police department. Councilor Dieng proposed an amendment to create a task force to study the appropriate number of police officers. Councilor Shannon supported the amendment. It did not pass. Jane Stromberg, another newly elected Progressive Party councilor and a recent University of Vermont graduate, proposed an amendment cutting the department even more, to 63 officers by 2023. It did not pass. Hightower’s resolution was voted on and approved on June 30, just five days after it was proposed. The vote was 9 to 3, with all nine yes votes acting as cosponsors of the resolution. Both Shannon and Dieng voted against it. For Shannon, the self-described “right-wing” of the council, it felt like “pulling something out of a hat.” “We made this decision with no public process,” she added. “Nothing was sent to committee for discussion. No effort was made to reach out to groups beyond the activists.” Though Dieng wanted police reform, he said he wanted it done with care. “Let’s not be reactive,” Dieng said. “Let’s be proactive.” “I remember telling the people back then that if we do it this way, we will regret it.” The unintended consequences appeared quickly. Slashing the police force through attrition, a process that some councilors assumed would take years, instead took months. Police officers began to leave in droves. Before defunding, Burlington averaged about 95-some effective, or active-duty, police officers. Today the department hovers around 64. There are often only five available to patrol at night, according to Chief Murad. Overtime costs have soared. “The exit interviews have been pretty clear that it was about a lack of support in a political sense,” Murad said. “And a sense of saying, ‘This is not how I want to serve anymore. I don’t feel valued.’” One of those officers, Greg, worked at the department for nearly 10 years and had just been promoted to detective when he resigned nearly a year after the resolution passed. He had earned a master’s degree in counseling. NBC News agreed to withhold his name for privacy. Burlington was his home, he said, and law enforcement a lifetime career. After defunding, Greg said many officers felt blindsided and that changes had been made without input from police officers themselves. It started to feel like the department had become a flashpoint for all of Burlington’s ills. Protestors gathered outside headquarters. Officers’ cars were keyed, and tires slashed. Greg stopped parking his in the department lot. “We’re human beings,” he said. “I would say right after the defund moment, it felt like a very violent place to have to go to work.” As the department grappled with its uncertain future, Greg felt his career prospects dim. He decided he wanted out. He left Vermont and began pursuing a degree in respiratory therapy. Today, he works part-time as a mobile crisis responder for a health provider, helping individuals facing mental health crises. “Because of my police experience, and because of my advanced education in psychology and related fields, I’m actually going to wind up directly doing the work that Burlington said they wanted from their officers,” he said. Chief Murad said it could take years to replace the officers he’s lost, like Greg. It takes about 14 months to hire, train and swear in an officer. Only a few out of hundreds of applicants make it through the police academy. Fewer officers forced the department to remove some specialized positions, including an emergency response officer who managed police responses to complex crises. It removed a street crime team that investigates robberies and drug activity. Emergency calls became prioritized by seriousness, meaning it often took police longer to respond to quality-of-life complaints and nonviolent crimes. “It’s easier to break things than it is to fix them,” Murad said. It’s hard to tell if crime has risen in Burlington as officers have left the force, in part because there are no solid numbers yet. The best year-to-year comparisons would come from FBI data -- which won’t be available until next year. For now, the Burlington Police Department has incident data for 2021. The data shows that the total number of incidents fell 11 percent in the first 11 months of 2021 versus the same period last year. Certain types of incidents did increase, however, including burglary, vehicle thefts and mental health issues and overdoses. It was on Church Street, Burlington’s busy downtown strip, where many of those incidents and the possible impact of defunding seemed most visible. Sharing the street with other residents and tourists are individuals struggling with housing instability, mental health and substance abuse — all issues aggravated by the pandemic. Since the police force shrank, however, officers have had to spend a greater percentage of their time on higher priority issues and less on quality of life. For 20 years, an outreach team from The Howard Center, a mental health provider, has helped connect people to social service programs and de-escalate conflict. Tammy Boudah, who’s been on the Howard Center team for 18 years and led it for the past four, said the pandemic and defunding changed the energy downtown. Boudah said she and her colleagues increasingly had to break up fights and witnessed more use of methamphetamine and other drugs. What’s disturbed her the most is that her clients say they feel unsafe. “Instead of being downtown and just people watching, they’re kind of like at a keg party,” she said. “The unintended consequence is that in defunding the police we’ve left some of the very people that I think they would be wanting to champion in an extremely vulnerable position,” she added. Merchants sent a letter to the city government asking for help. Because of an increase in quality-of-life issues, the city recently contracted a private security firm to patrol the park in front of City Hall, which lies on Church Street. “I don’t see this as a sort of helpful, thoughtful reallocation of resources,” Mayor Weinberger said regarding the $110,000 contract. Mark Bouchett, who owns a homegoods store on Church Street, said defunding hit hard for many independent business owners. Quality-of-life issues stacked up, and he became concerned after several female employees said they felt unsafe walking to their cars at night. He also said many business owners became “terrified” to raise concerns publicly. “If you speak out against defunding the police force, you’re labeled a racist,” he said. “Or at least an idiot that doesn’t understand the problem.” By early 2021, the city had begun trying to find a way to fix the problems that defunding had created. That January, the mayor asked the City Council to raise the officer cap back up to 84. It didn’t pass. But the council did fund new positions at the department to shift certain calls away from the police. It authorized BPD to hire up to 10 community service officers, which are unarmed, non-sworn positions that support basic police operations, like parking enforcement. It also authorized the hiring of three community support liaisons — social workers who work alongside the department to respond to calls related to homelessness, mental health and substance use. The nearly eight-month delay in implementing these positions, coupled with the exodus of officers, meant the city was still playing catch up. ”We can’t defund without refunding, the whole point is to fund something else,” said Hightower. “And we didn’t do anything for a very long time.” Since 2020, nearly a dozen communities across the U.S. have significantly altered their law enforcement budgets. But the movement to defund has faced a backlash — especially in the face of a soaring nationwide murder rate. Some have increased police budgets to pay for reforms, while others have reversed defunding decisions. In Austin, Tex., slashing the police budget by 30 percent created many of the same issues Burlington is dealing with, from an exodus of police officers to intense political clashes. In Minneapolis voters resoundingly rejected a proposal to defund the city’s police. “The big picture message is reality is setting in,” said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit focused on improving policing. “At the end of the day, they want better policing. They don’t want to abolish the police.” Shortly after the original defunding resolution passed in June 2020, the city began the process of hiring an outside firm to conduct an independent analysis of the city’s policing. The independent analysis was released three months ago, in September. It concluded that though BPD has made strides in reform, it’s also grappling with several systemic issues, including an inadequate internal investigation process. It also noted that community engagement and outreach are under-resourced and the department lacks sufficient training in regard to mental health and de-escalation. Fixing those kinds of problems will require more training, and therefore, the opposite of defunding, says Chief Murad. “Good policing is expensive,” Murad said. Reform can’t happen, he added, by “merely saying, ‘We’re just not going to have police anymore.’ I think that that has ultimately proven to be a grand experiment on a national and local level that’s gone awry."" By the time the analysis was released, the City Council had already unanimously approved $400,000 for acute mental health services. The mayor had also taken steps toward creating a team of mental health professionals and clinicians, who will work with police to handle mental health and substance abuse issues. The analysis also recommended the city raise its officer cap. In October, the City Council voted to raise the cap of sworn officers up to 79 — a number within the range recommended in the analysis. The city will also soon be offering $10,000 bonuses to its remaining police officers to prevent any more from quitting. The raised cap passed 8 to 4. Hightower and Stromberg — one of whom had proposed the staffing cut in 2020, the other of whom had tried to make the cut deeper — were the margin of victory. They broke with the other four Progressives on the council and voted to raise the cap. Hightower and Stromberg were joined by all the Democrats and independents, including a new independent member who had won election in March 2021 after blasting the way defunding had been handled. He replaced a retiring Democrat who had voted for the original proposal. Mayor Weinberger thanked Hightower and Stromberg “for recognizing through their votes that our sworn officers are foundational to realizing our shared goals of a transformed, progressive public safety infrastructure in Burlington.” A week after the vote, Murad stood at a lectern and swore in his newest staff: three community service liaisons, two community service officers and one probationary police officer. It was a hopeful moment. “I am very, very proud that you have joined this department at this time, when this city needs it so much,” Murad said, before he shook their hands. “This is a beginning.” Looking back, Councilor Stromberg said, “it would have been probably a little bit better and a little bit smoother of a process to do the assessment, first and foremost. … And it’s a learning experience, I’ll admit, when maybe we didn’t make the right decision.” Hightower said that although the past year had been difficult, change rarely happens from within. “The reason we have a really progressive police department is because we have a lot of activists who have constantly pushed the police department,” she said. Asked if “there was an acknowledgement” the cuts were too deep and too fast, she said, “I think that there’s an acknowledgement that these cuts went too fast for the pace of the alternatives.” When asked whether she wished she and the council could go back and do it differently, she said, “If wishes were fishes, yeah, of course.”",U.S./NBC News,"Burlington, Vermont, decided to cut its police force 30 percent.

He will set out ""what the winter will look like"" for those who ""choose to remain unvaccinated,"" she added. Joe Biden is to address the nation Tuesday to outline extra steps he will take to deal with the Omicron coronavirus variant and deliver a ""stark warning"" to people who remained unvaccinated. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Saturday tweeted the president ""will announce new steps the Administration is taking to help communities in need of assistance, while also issuing a stark warning of what the winter will look like for Americans that choose to remain unvaccinated."" She added: ""We are prepared for the rising case levels, and [the president] will detail how we will respond to this challenge. ""He will remind Americans that they can protect themselves from severe illness from COVID-19 by getting vaccinated and getting their booster shot when they are eligible."" The words signal a shift in messaging from the White House. As of December 16, more than 240 million Americans had had at least one dose of a vaccine — around 73% of the total population. The seven-day average of daily cases was at 127,692 at December 18, up from 85,139 on December 1. The Omicron variant is a growing proportion of US cases, after it drove case surges in other countries. Early data suggests Omicron may be more transmissible but cause less severe illness than other coronavirus strains, Insider's Aria Bendix reported. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts that COVID-19 cases and deaths will increase in the US over the next month, with its latest model projecting more than 40,000 further deaths by January 8. New York reported on Friday 21,027 new COVID-19 cases in a single day, the highest the state has ever recorded. Biden outlined extra measures earlier in December to combat the rise in cases, including boosters for all adults and expanded at-home testing. The announcement he will address the nation Tuesday follows Vice President Kamala Harris saying the administration ""didn't see"" the Delta or Omicron variants coming. She told the Los Angeles Times: ""We didn't see Delta coming. I think most scientists did not — upon whose advice and direction we have relied — didn't see Delta coming. ""We didn't see Omicron coming. And that's the nature of what this, this awful virus has been, which as it turns out, has mutations and variants.""

12/19/2021,"Three retired army generals penned an op-ed in The Washington Post about the risks of another insurrection in 2024. They highlighted that 1 in 10 of those charged in relation to the Capitol riot had a service record. They warned that if 'rogue units' pledged loyalty to the loser of the 2024 election, it could cause a civil war. Three retired US army generals warned of an insurrection or even civil war if the results of the 2024 presidential election were not accepted by some in the military. Former Major Gen. Paul Eaton, former Major Gen. Antonio Taguba, and former Brig. Gen. Steven Anderson made the warnings in an op-ed in The Washington Post on Friday. They wrote that they were ""increasingly concerned"" about the 2024 election and the ""potential for lethal chaos inside our military."" The generals highlighted the ""disturbing number"" of veterans and active-duty members of the military that took part in the January 6 attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters – more than 1 in 10 of those charged had a service record. They outlined a possible situation in which, after the 2024 election, some service members might pledge loyalty to a ""Trumpian loser"" who refuses to concede defeat and tries to lead a shadow government. ""Under such a scenario, it is not outlandish to say a military breakdown could lead to civil war,"" they wrote. Since the last election, the generals warned that even more turmoil and division had emerged in the armed forces. They pointed to recent resistance within the military towards federal vaccine mandates, such as a refusal to comply led by the commander of the Oklahoma National Guard, Brig. Gen. Thomas Mancino. Mancino claimed that while the Oklahoma Guard is not federally mobilized, their commander in chief is the Republican governor of the state and not the president. The generals wrote that they fear if 2024 is a contested election that splits loyalties, there is the ""potential for a total breakdown of the chain of command along partisan lines."" ""The idea of rogue units organizing among themselves to support the 'rightful' commander in chief cannot be dismissed,"" they said. The generals urged that everything must be done to prevent another insurrection, including holding leaders who inspired the last one to be held to account. They said there was also work to be done by the military, such as reviewing how to deal with illegal orders and undertaking intelligence work to identify and remove potential mutineers. The military should also work to identify how misinformation spreads in the ranks. The generals also suggested that the Defense Department ""war-game"" possible post-election scenarios to identify weak spots and put in place ""safeguards.""

12/19/2021,"If you feel like you're seeing that shiny metal ""T"" more on the road, you're not mistaken. Electric vehicles sales are soaring, and Tesla is leading the charge. The number of newly registered electrical vehicles in the U.S. more than doubled in the first half of 2021 compared to the same time last year, says a recent report by Experian. Elon Musk's car company commands a nearly 66% share. But even though many Americans have decided a Tesla is worth the high sticker price, they could be in for a shock when they try to find affordable insurance for these technological and ecological marvels. While you’re going to save about $250 a month on gas, any electric vehicle will generally cost you more to insure. Why is that? Car insurance companies come up with rates based on a whole range of factors. So even if you have a spotless driving record, live in a low-crime area and take advantage of some driving discounts, your rate is still likely to go up compared to your gas-powered car. That’s because electric vehicles cost more outright and are more expensive to repair. The insurance company may deem you low risk to file a claim, but if anything happens to your car, it’s going to mean costly repairs. So your premiums are set high to reflect that risk. If your premium with a gas-powered car is $1,000 a year, you’ll probably pay $1,180 to $1,320 with an electric car, according to ValuePenguin. As a luxury car, Teslas are pricier still. Motortrend has studied how much it would cost each year to insure the various Tesla models available. Among other factors, these averages assume the owner is a single 40-year-old man with a clean record and good credit score: Tesla Model 3: $2,114-$2,351 Tesla Model S: $3,673-$4,143 Tesla Model Y: $2,118-$2,227 Tesla Model X: $3,355-$4,025 And other car companies, including Chevrolet and Ford, are making gains against Tesla in the EV market, so be aware of the potential for higher insurance costs across the brands. Of course, your rates will vary from insurer to insurer — which is why you should always compare quotes from multiple insurers. Most electric cars generally cost more to buy than standard vehicles. And when they’re damaged, you may have a harder time finding a mechanic qualified to repair them — in addition to requiring more expensive and difficult-to-source parts. Damaged batteries can add to your repair costs. If your battery’s leaking, your mechanic will have to take extra precautionary measures, which will be reflected in your bill. There’s also the need for a charging station. You should expect to have to pay somewhere in the range of $200 to $1,000 to install your own charging station before you hit the road. Nevertheless, you can expect your new car to incur lower maintenance expenses overall. Electric cars also don’t need frequent oil changes or replacement radiator hoses, fan belts or gaskets. So even with slightly higher insurance, your car budget shouldn’t have to change drastically. If you do purchase a Tesla or another EV and begin the process of switching over your insurance policy, don’t forget to ask your insurer if there are any promotions or discounts you can take advantage of to lower your costs. You may be able to bundle your other policies, like home insurance or life insurance. Insurance companies often give discounts to safe drivers with clean records. Don’t be afraid to ask in case you’ve missed something in your own research. But your best option to find savings when you’re looking for car insurance is to shop around for rates. The Insurance Information Institute recommends you seek out at least three quotes before settling on an offer. Some studies show shopping around can save you up to $1,100 a year on auto insurance. With that done, you’ll feel all the power of sitting in the driver’s seat even when you’re not behind the wheel. This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.
