2/15/2022,"Hello, Tuesday has arrived as promised, and here is a briefing by way of accompaniment. My name is Warren Murray – welcome along.  Boris Johnson and Joe Biden believe there remains “a crucial window for diplomacy and for Russia to step back from its threats towards Ukraine” after a 40-minute call between the two leaders overnight. Russia is sending thousands more troops to its border with Ukraine in a sign that Vladimir Putin could extend the crisis for weeks, as Johnson warned the situation had become “very, very dangerous”. The US is moving its remaining embassy staff in Ukraine from the capital, Kyiv, to the city of Lviv, further west. A White House spokeswoman said: “We are in the window when an invasion could begin at any time.” The British ambassador has remained in Kyiv, along with a core team. Join us for live coverage of the crisis. A video address from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: “We are told that February 16 will be the day of attack.” In another message he said: “They are trying to frighten us by yet again naming a date for the start of military action … We strive for peace and want to solve all issues exclusively through negotiations.” Putin’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said in a meeting with Putin staged for the cameras: “It seems to me that our possibilities [for negotiation] are far from being exhausted. They certainly should not continue indefinitely. But at this stage I would suggest that they continue and be intensified,” to which Putin assented. At the same time, a senior Russian diplomat told the Guardian that Russia would be within its rights to “counterattack” against a Ukrainian attack on the population in “Donbas or wherever”. Donbas is the region of eastern Ukraine where Russia has armed and funded an insurgency since 2014, and where the Kremlin has handed out hundreds of thousands of Russian passports. US officials have said they believe Russia is preparing a “false flag” incident that could be used as a pretext for an intervention. Western diplomatic efforts have continued. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is due to meet Putin in Moscow today while Johnson is to chair a Cobra emergency meeting. PM answers to Met – Boris Johnson is expected to deny wrongdoing to the police over partygate, arguing his presence at Downing Street gatherings in lockdown was part of the working day. The prime minister has until Friday to answer a questionnaire that may lead to a fixed penalty notice. No 10 said his response to the Metropolitan police would remain private. Scotland Yard will reportedly reveal the number of people fined at each partygate event that is being investigated and explain why the decision was taken, civil servants have been told. Speaking on a visit in Scotland, Johnson said he would have “a lot more in due course” to say on the partygate row once the police investigation was concluded, at which point the full investigation by Sue Gray is expected to be published. Any penalty awarded by the police has the potential to spark fresh expressions of no confidence in Johnson from Tory MPs. Canada emergency – Justin Trudeau has invoked an emergency law giving his Canadian government sweeping, month-long powers to fight a growing number of “illegal and dangerous” blockades. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Alberta announced they had seized a truck full of firearms at a blockade near the US border. The deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, said the Act would bar the use of crowdfunding websites for illegal activities and punish companies whose trucks were being used in the protests. It comes after a hack of the crowdfunding site GiveSendGo revealed substantial financial support from outside Canada, which Freeland called an attack on democracy. Both the city of Ottawa and the province of Ontario had already declared states of emergency before Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act. More help for abuse victims – Domestic abuse survivors would find it easier to move away from perpetrators under proposals unveiled by ministers. The plans, which are being put out to consultation, would scrap the so-called local connection qualification for social housing, which potentially forces victims to remain in the same community as their abuser. Making it easier for victims to remove perpetrators from joint tenancies will also be considered. Further funding for councils will help ensure safe accommodation spaces such as refuges and shelters that can provide healthcare, social workers and benefits, interpreters, immigration advice, drug or alcohol support and other specialist services. ‘Unfortunate editorialising’ – A judge has thrown out Sarah Palin’s lawsuit accusing the New York Times of defaming her by incorrectly linking her to a mass murder. But unusually, the jury has not been told of the judge’s decision and is continuing its deliberations. The judge said he expected Palin to appeal, and the appeals court “would greatly benefit from knowing how the jury would decide it”. Palin, the 2008 Republican vice-presidential candidate, sued over an editorial linking her to a mass shooting that wounded the Democratic congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Judge Jed Rakoff said it was “an example of very unfortunate editorialising” by the paper but “the law here sets a very high standard [for actual malice]. The court finds that that standard has not been met.” The New York Times has not lost a libel case in a US courtroom in more than 50 years. Heart in the whitebait’s place – Scientists at Harvard and Emory universities have engineered an artificial fish whose tail is powered by cells from a human heart. It doesn’t sound all that necessary, but they say the “biohybrid” of paper, plastic, gelatin and two strips of living heart muscle cells marks a hopeful step in the advancement of heart treatments. “The heart is extremely complex and it’s not enough to mimic the anatomy,” said Kit Parker, one of the authors of the study. “One must recreate the biophysics in order to have the robust behaviour required of building engineered hearts for children born with malformed hearts.” The artificial fish swam for more than 100 days, during which the muscle cells even grew stronger. As US intelligence sources warn of an imminent Russian invasion, residents of the Ukrainian capital are refusing to be cowed, reports Shaun Walker.

On day 11 of the Winter Olympics, Russian Kamila Valieva returns to the ice after being cleared to compete again at the Beijing Games despite a positive doping test hanging over her head. The 15-year-old figure skater has been caught in a complicated mess that has been coming for years, writes Sean Ingle, while Bryan Armen Graham argues that the blame lies with the coaches and organisations who have failed her. Meanwhile, the US sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson, who was banned from the summer Olympics for a similar offence, questioned the decision. Eddie Jones is hopeful of unleashing Manu Tuilagi and Courtney Lawes against Wales when England’s Six Nations campaign resumes on Saturday week. Stuart Broad has hit out at his “unjust” omission from England’s Test squad, describing the “five-minute” phone call from Andrew Strauss that delivered the news as a case of being “blindsided”. The FIA has chosen not to disclose the findings of its inquiry into the controversial climax of the Formula One world championship-deciding Abu Dhabi Grand Prix last season. And Ralf Rangnick has turned to his sports psychologist Sascha Lense to try to rebuild Manchester United’s confidence and end their habits of losing leads. It could be another turbulent day on the markets after Asian stocks fell sharply today in line with the big losses in London and Europe yesterday. The FTSE is due to lose about 0.4% at the opening although hopes of more diplomacy in Ukraine could take the edge off investor nerves. Oil has dropped about 1% today while the pound is flat at $1.353 and €1.196. Our economics team look at whether the Bank of England is right to be pushing interest rates higher or whether the denizens of Threadneedle Street are merely laying the groundwork for the next recession. Our Guardian splash headline today says “‘Very, very dangerous’: PM’s warning on Russia build-up”. The i has “Last-ditch efforts to stop war in Europe” while the Mirror’s read is “Final warning from west: Last chance to stop war”. Not the least bit inflammatory is the Express: “Final warning Putin! It’s peace or you’ll pay high price”. “Lavrov’s hint at ‘way forward’ lifts hopes on averting war in Ukraine” – that’s the Financial Times, and the Times and Telegraph have similar headlines but attributed to Boris Johnson and Joe Biden instead. The Metro’s tack is a little different: “PM: just say ‘no’ … ‘Europe hooked on Russian gas supplies’” – Johnson said countries like France and Germany needed to stand up to Putin and “get Nord Stream out of the bloodstream”. There’s a basement strapline for Ukraine in the Mail but its lead is “33 die without justice in post office scandal”, which is about people running post offices being wrongly accused of fraud and theft.

2/15/2022,"The 2021 Australian of the Year, Grace Tame, has once again been dragged into the media cycle, this time for *checks notes* sitting in close proximity to a bong eight years ago. Let’s break down what actually happened, and if this is really a big deal.  Well, the news site Daily Mail Australia on Monday unearthed a photo that appears to imply that when Tame – a dedicated advocate for sexual assault education and a survivor herself – was 19, she hung out with people who possibly smoked weed and may even have partaken herself. The Instagram photo – which, in true 2014 style, has a heavy sepia filter over it – shows a young Tame sitting on a couch with a large weed smoking device, next to a man who appears to be rolling a cigarette with what may or may not be (whispers) marijuana. Some real buzzkills seemed to have spent their time scrolling back far enough in Tame’s Instagram feed, finding the photos and commenting: “Australian of the year?” The photo was deleted shortly afterwards, but not before the Daily Mail grabbed a screenshot and published an article. It really doesn’t seem like it, no. Besides the original commenters quoted in the article, and the editorial team at the Daily Mail who felt this was newsworthy to begin with, the reception to the photo has been surprisingly un-boomers-ish. In fact, dozens of people, including some in public office, have come to Tame’s defence by exposing their own teenage run-ins with the wacky-tobaccy. Despite the Liberal party’s previous stance on drug testing welfare recipients, federal MP Dave Sharma chimed in, stating he felt “this stuff isn’t remotely in the public interest”, and that he was sure there was a “photo of [him] like that”. The deputy mayor of Port Phillip, Tim Baxter, proclaimed himself to be a former bong user. Others, including former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull’s son, Alex Turnbull, were quick to point out that they knew people currently in politics who had dabbled with much more serious substances; understandably, they weren’t as forthcoming with specific names. And of course, some showed their solidarity in a less political and more practical way. Despite deleting the photograph at first, Tame appears to have taken Bong-gate in her stride, using the bizarre situation as an opportunity to poke fun at Scott Morrison for allegedly soiling himself at an Engadine McDonald’s restaurant after the 1997 NRL grand final. (I’m legally obliged to remind you there is no actual evidence to back up this longstanding urban legend sparked by a joke tweet in 2018). “But did she shit herself at Maccas after the ‘97 NRL GF?” one Twitter user asked. “Quite possibly, I would’ve been 2 years old. I shit myself a lot back then,” Tame replied. She later suggested she was actually playing a “cover of April Sun in Cuba. On the oboe,” referencing the prime minister’s widely mocked ukulele rendition on 60 Minutes on Sunday night. Alright, I confess, we were doing a cover of ‘April Sun in Cuba’. On the oboe. pic.twitter.com/MKKsm7EF3y If this whole ordeal shows us anything, it’s that Australian society doesn’t really view cannabis use as a moral crime any more. The Daily Mail has seemingly backpedalled on its bong coverage, publishing articles showing the glowing response Tame received on social media. Even the regular conservative think pieces on the photo have been rather reserved. According to data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 36% of Australians aged 14 and over had used cannabis in their lifetime, 11.6% in the last year. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning And the latest National Drug Strategy Household Survey showed that 41.1% of respondents supported the legalisation of cannabis for personal use in 2019 – a significant rise from 25.5% in 2013, though health experts are wary, warning of the potential risks associated with cannabis use. Cannabis-related arrests have been on the rise, growing by 30% in the last decade according to the Australian Crime Commission’s 2019-2020 report. In the 2019-20 financial year, Australian police made 76,669 weed-related arrests, the third-highest number on record. But with the photo prompting many high-profile figures to publicly engage in discussions about the normality of cannabis use in Australian life, some have suggested this could be the beginning of a larger conversation.",News/Australia news,Grace Tame is back in headlines for an old bong photo – what actually happened?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/15/grace-tame-is-back-in-headlines-for-an-old-bong-photo-what-actually-happened
2/15/2022," The watchable Scottish forensics drama returns for a second season (back on Alibi, after its short transfer to the BBC during the pandemic) and things kick off with a literal bang: the women of the Scottish Institute of Forensic Science and Anatomy get stuck in to finding out who’s behind a Dundee bombing. Meanwhile, Daniel (Martin Compston) prepares for his dad’s murder trial, but is also celebrating some good news (though others think it’s terrible).

2/15/2022,"Scientists at Harvard University have engineered an artificial fish whose flapping tail is powered by cells from a human heart, a groundbreaking project that has ignited hopes for the future of cardiac research. The team of scientists at Harvard, in collaboration with Emory University, built the “biohybrid fish” using paper, plastic, gelatin and two strips of living heart muscle cells, the contractions of which pulled the fish’s tail from side to side and allowed it to swim.  The research team published its findings in the journal Science last week, and video released by Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (Seas) on Twitter shows a small robotic fish flapping its tail and moving about for about 20 seconds. This artificial fish is powered by human heart cells.https://t.co/aioJKFDZft pic.twitter.com/6c5nIbA1sn The study marks a hopeful step in the advancement of heart treatments such as pacemakers. “The benefit of this fish project is that we are still trying to master the craft of using live cells as an engineering substrate,” Kit Parker, one of the authors of the study, told the Guardian on Monday. “The heart is extremely complex and it’s not enough to mimic the anatomy,” added Parker, a Seas professor. “One must recreate the biophysics in order to have the robust behavior required of building engineered hearts for children born with malformed hearts.” Earlier, Parker had told NPR that at first scientists were not sure how long the school of artificial fish would function but they swam for more than 100 days. Parker told the Guardian that the team was pleasantly surprised. “By replicating the biophysics of the heart into this fish, we were activating various processes within these cells that are designed to help them sustain themselves,” he said. “We are hoping that in our next endeavor, we will keep these cells and these tissues alive much longer than even four and a half months.” The muscle cells in the experiment reportedly grew stronger with exercise, a positive indication that this could be implemented in treating heart failures. Parker was also previously part of a Harvard team that in 2016 built a small robotic stingray also powered by heart cells from a rat that contracted when exposed to light. Despite the latest extraordinary development, Parker says a lot more work needs to be done. “We learned what we needed to learn, we have adapted the inventions to our current efforts to understand pediatric disease,” he said, “and now we are moving on to try to build a more complex model of a three-dimensional marine organism using human cardiac cells and human cardiac biophysics.”",News/Science,Scientists build robotic fish powered by human heart cells,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/14/scientists-build-robotic-fish-powered-by-human-heart-cells
2/15/2022,"If you happen to imagine that there’s not much left to discover of Britain’s stone age, or that its relics consist of hard-to-love postholes and scraps of bones, then you need to find your way to Orkney, that scatter of islands off Scotland’s north-east coast. On the archipelago’s Mainland, out towards the windswept west coast with its wave-battered cliffs, you will come to the Ness of Brodgar, an isthmus separating a pair of sparkling lochs, one of saltwater and one of freshwater. Just before the way narrows you’ll see the Stones of Stenness rising up before you. This ancient stone circle’s monoliths were once more numerous, but they remain elegant and imposing. Like a gateway into a liminal world of theatricality and magic, they lead the eye to another, even larger neolithic monument beyond the isthmus, elevated in the landscape as if on a stage. This is the Ring of Brodgar, its sharply individuated stones like giant dancers arrested mid-step – as local legend, indeed, has it.  It’s between these two stone circles that archaeologist Nick Card and his team are excavating a huge settlement of neolithic stone buildings. The earliest date from about 3300BC, their walls and hearths crisply intact, their pots and stone tools in remarkable profusion, the whole bounded by six-metre-wide monumental walls. “You could continue for several lifetimes and not get to the bottom of it,” says the neatly white-bearded, laconic Card as we gaze out over the site, presently covered with tarpaulin to protect it from the winter storms. “Every year it never fails to produce something that astounds us.” After nearly two decades of digging, they have excavated only about 10% of its area, and about 5% of its volume. It goes deep: buildings are stacked on the ruins of older ones; the place was in use for 1,000 years. When summer comes, they’ll dig again. When the coverings come off each July, says Card’s colleague, Anne Mitchell, “down you go and you’re among the ghosts of the past”. Many of the most intriguing finds from the Ness of Brodgar will be on show at the British Museum this month in a new exhibition, the World of Stonehenge, a survey of northern-European prehistory from the era of the hunter-gatherers to the early bronze age, using the long, complex history of Britain’s most celebrated neolithic monument as the story’s spine. The landscape around the ness reminds me of the barrow-studded downs around Stonehenge, in fact – both have the feel of a vast stage, ready to be used for ritual or performance. The earliest buildings here are older than Stonehenge, though. “For neolithic stone architecture, Orkney blows everywhere else out of the water,” says Neil Wilkin, curator of the British Museum show. Elsewhere in Europe – including the settlement at Durrington Walls in Wiltshire, now thought to be where the builders of Stonehenge lived – wood was the favoured construction material for neolithic domestic buildings. But in Orkney the inhabitants also built their houses from stone. (There were perhaps many wooden structures too, but stone architecture around here is so profuse that the search for postholes feels less urgent; there are few trees on Orkney now, but maybe more then, as well as a plentiful supply of driftwood.) It means the whole archipelago is dotted not just with incredibly well preserved neolithic tombs, neatly built out of the local flagstone, but also villages – construction of a scale and quality that would not be repeated until well into the medieval era, 4,000 years later. These include the famous Skara Brae, a coastal settlement revealed when a storm whipped away the great blanket of sand that had hidden it until 1850. But there are other, more ghostly places, too, like the unexcavated village on the eroding coastline of Sanday that Mark Edmonds, local resident and York University archaeology professor emeritus, describes at the start of his book, Orcadia. Orkney was not peripheral or cut off in the stone age; its surrounding waters were not barriers but pathways, to Ireland, to mainland Britain, and beyond. Neolithic axes made of jadeite, quarried in the Italian Alps, have been found in Scotland: the most beautiful example, on loan from the National Museum of Scotland, will be in the World of Stonehenge show. “It’s so simple and so exquisite,” says the exhibition’s assistant curator, Jennifer Wexler, “with a kind of modernist feel to it. And it just sparkles in the light.” Aesthetics were important in this world. The characteristic pottery – “grooved ware” – used by the builders of Stonehenge was first made in Orkney, it is thought. Card and his team have found 100,000 sherds of it so far. Mitchell explains how they tease it out of the middens (ancient refuse heaps) using a cake slice and an aluminium sheet salvaged from an old helicopter. A lot of these sherds are in boxes stacked floor-to-ceiling in their HQ, a bungalow on the site bursting with material. Some of the pottery is rather crumbly – like “digestive biscuits”, says ceramics expert Roy Towers, one of the volunteers on this donations-funded dig. Jan Blatchford, another highly skilled volunteer, shows me how reflectance transformation imaging – a digital photography technique using multiple camera angles – can expose details barely visible to the naked eye. Here is the mark where a plaited mat made its imprint on the base of one newly made, unfired pot; here are the whorls of the maker’s thumbprint on another, bringing the dizzyingly intimate sense of a human hand shaping the vessel 5,000 years ago. It was out of the window of this little house that, washing vegetables at her sink one day in 2003, the former owner saw a plough stutter as a piece of masonry got lodged between its blades. It was worked, neolithic stone. The farmer contacted the local archaeologists. “We’d all been driving past the place for years assuming it was a natural ridge,” says Edmonds – rather than ancient ruins, hiding in plain sight. The immense settlement is an ongoing revelation – and yet, perhaps, not entirely surprising. The islands are teeming with neolithic remains. Edmonds tells me he once interviewed Orcadian families, asking them about the ancient stone axes and other finds they have on their mantelpieces, rich with stories of discovery by this or that great-grandparent. Some of these neolithic finds, like the intricately carved stone balls that turn up here and elsewhere, or the incredible newly discovered Burton Agnes and Folkton “drums”, little stone cylinders found buried with children in North Yorkshire, have no obvious practical purpose, and are decorated with designs that are obscure to our eyes, dense with irrecoverable significance. The same goes for the ancient “cup and ring” marks that exist on naturally occurring outcrops in the British landscape, in great quantity in places like Kilmartin Glen in Argyll. “I like the idea that each is a prayer or a mantra … I think the meaning may be in the making,” muses Wilkin of the patterns.  The buildings of the Ness of Brodgar are also decorated and inscribed, thickly but often subtly, with patterns – lozenges, cross-hatching, sometimes a kind of butterfly shape. At times the marks can be hard to make out. “One building had been exposed for several years and it wasn’t until the sun hit it in a particular way that we began to see it,” Card says. “We find more in August than July, in the raking light,” adds Mitchell. These patterns, these subtle strokes in the stone, have their echoes throughout the British Museum exhibition. Wilkin tells me he wanted to tell a story of influence and connection, of ideas travelling beyond the horizon, of people on the move. That starts with those who trudged across Doggerland when Britain’s east coast was still connected to continental Europe, and continues with those who brought farming to Britain from across the Channel about 6,000 years ago, to the “Beaker people” who arrived from around 2500BC, all but replacing them. The story is almost unimaginably long, told through artefacts from the haunting headdress fashioned by hunter-gatherers from deer antlers 11,000 years ago in Star Carr, Yorkshire, all the way to the outrageously strange conical hats fashioned from gold in France and Germany 10,000 years later. Not to mention the spellbinding teacup-size vessel, shaped from a single lump of amber about 1750BC, that’s a treasure of the Hove Museum and ought to be better known, and what I can’t help thinking of as “the amber spyglass” – a disk of translucent amber set in bronze, made in Denmark around 1200BC, that might once, possibly, have been use to “catch” the sun. Why the peoples of Orkney, and Wiltshire, and many other places in Britain, built vast monuments of stone 5,000 years ago, is a question that can never be definitively answered – and when we try, we almost certainly say more about ourselves than the real intentions of our distant ancestors. When I ask Edmonds what he thinks – we are standing in the little reconstructed neolithic house at Skara Brae at the time, sheltering from a hailstorm with a flask of coffee – he offers one word, albeit with a question mark: “Hubris?” Humans, he argues, seem to build remarkable monuments when they are either establishing power – or feeling under threat or pressure. Maybe these far distant people, their lives so alien and so unreachable, would find something to recognise in us, after all. The World of Stonehenge is at the British Museum, London, 17 February to 17 July.

2/15/2022,"Chevonne Baker does this job because she is good at it, because she cares. She gets a sense of pride when her clients brighten up as she walks into the room. She credits her success as a care worker to her brisk efficiency, tempered with empathy. When a client is difficult, Baker keeps her cool, sometimes stepping outside the room for a few moments to compose herself. She is a master of small talk, keeping up a steady stream of cheerful banalities as she opens curtains, dusts and stacks crockery and attends to personal care. She understands that she may be the only person her elderly clients see all day, so she makes an effort to draw them into conversation. She understands that if they are rude it is because they have no one else at whom they can vent their frustration. She understands that a care worker’s job is about more than personal care. She is a confidante, a support network, a healthcare professional and a companion.  Baker is 23 and has been working for the at-home care provider Right at Home in Basingstoke for two and a half years. With her university degree – Baker studied performing arts at the University of Winchester – she could probably earn more in a different sector. She makes between £11 and £12 an hour, depending on whether she is working weekends, and is reimbursed for her mileage. (Relative to other at-home care providers, Right at Home’s pay is generous. Many firms pay only the minimum wage.) Her responsibilities vary. Sometimes she washes and dresses her clients. She may give them their medication and monitor their mood. Other times she prepares meals, or does housework, or takes them to social clubs, or simply sits with them and talks. She makes tea, endless cups of it – so many that she loses count each day. Baker fell into care work. She had planned to become a primary school teacher, but halfway through her final year of university she realised that she had had enough of academia. She moved to Basingstoke with a group of three friends and found a job working in a cafe, but it went bust. “I’ll be honest,” she says. “I really needed money. I thought: ‘I’ll do anything for now.’” A friend suggested care work. She didn’t expect to like it. “And then I came out of my first week and realised I couldn’t stop smiling,” she says. “So I thought I’d stay for a bit longer – and I never left.” Her parents weren’t thrilled; they thought she could do better. “I spent months convincing them I do actually like my job,” she says. Baker finds the perception that care work is low-skilled frustrating. “It takes a certain kind of person to be able to have the level of compassion, but also the technical skills,” she says. “We have to do a lot of manual handling and you want to make sure you do it safely. We use hoists and we give people medication.” Then there is the emotional labour: no matter how Baker feels, she has to control her emotions to project an attitude of cheery professionalism. “About a year and a half ago, I went through a period when I was not a happy bunny,” she says. “I would wake up feeling really sad every morning and cry in the car. But when I pulled up outside the client’s house, I would put a smile on my face, no matter how fake it might be. And just by going in and saying good morning, I would forget I was upset. Because the client doesn’t deserve to know I am upset. They need to know that I am there for them.” When she was driving between appointments, she let the tears flow freely again. As care workers go, Baker is the best. You would trust her with your mother. But this has not been an easy winter for Britain’s beleaguered social care sector. Baker has required all her wit to navigate the past few months. Late November. The care sector is almost permanently short-staffed, with little capacity in the system for people to be off sick, and this year is no exception. People are coming down with coughs and sniffles and, given the Covid risk, having to self‑isolate as they await PCR results. Almost everyone, Baker included, is being asked to cover extra shifts by their managers. Because Right at Home struggles to recruit care workers, it has to turn away new clients often. An office manager tells Baker that they got a call about a client who was taken into hospital. A condition of her discharge was that she got an extra visit in the evenings, but they didn’t have the care workers to meet this demand and provide continuity of care, meaning the woman had to be moved to a different care company. Right at Home recently increased its pay by 7% to help recruit and retain staff. This is a nationwide problem. Providers simply aren’t able to get the staff they need. A November 2021 survey of providers by the Homecare Association found that 85% said recruitment was “the hardest it had ever been”, while 45% of providers were unable to take on new work. Like many providers, Right at Home has lost EU workers who returned to mainland Europe after Brexit. To make matters worse, demand for their services has never been higher. “Across the board, everyone has seen an increase in demand,” says Dr Jane Townson, the chief executive of the Homecare Association. Since 2020, the number of hours of home care purchased by public bodies has increased by 11%. This is because more older and disabled people are living longer, but also due to the pandemic: because of the NHS backlog, some people with chronic conditions deteriorated as they were waiting for hospital care. “Family members have been propping everyone up, but they are at their wits’ end,” says Townson. When people aren’t able to access the social care they need in the community, they are more likely to “block” hospital beds. “When I was on the board of an NHS trust, 80% of our inpatients were over the age of 80,” says Townson. “When you can’t discharge people out of the back door into social care, you end up with ambulances stacking up at the front door.” In desperation, healthcare bosses in Cornwall have been offering families £1,200 cash grants to take elderly relatives out of hospital to free up bed space. Other NHS trusts are discharging people into so-called “care hotels”, to be looked after by live-in carers. Baker visits one of her regular clients, a woman in her mid-80s. Dora is stylish and kind. She jokes that she doesn’t have the waistline she used to. Normally, Baker would take Dora to a social club at a nearby church, but this week she refuses to go. Dora says it is because she is waiting for a phone call, but Baker suspects that she is worried about Covid. “It’s been hard work – not just with her, but with several other clients – to actually get them out of the house, even now the restrictions have eased,” says Baker. “They’ve had a year of being told not to go out because they’re vulnerable, and now they’re being told that it’s actually OK and they won’t get ill.” Not only is Dora unwilling to go out to her social club, but she doesn’t want her family to come to visit her. “She’s so worried about the virus,” Baker says. She insisted on spending Christmas 2020 alone. “It’s for a selfless reason,” Baker says. “She’s worried about giving them the virus. She doesn’t want to cause any risk at all.” Baker bids goodbye to another of her clients, a woman in her 90s who is being moved into a care home. “She told me that I was a literal angel,” Baker says. “I said: ‘You go to church a lot. Are you in touch with the big guy? Is there something I need to know?’” The client cries as she says goodbye. Baker struggles to stay composed. “I form connections with clients really quickly,” she says. The client tells her what a difference she has made to her life. Baker will probably never see her again. Later in November. The office has been getting phone calls, requesting end-of-life care packages, but it is unable to help: they don’t have the staff. End-of-life services are the most labour-intensive they provide, usually requiring two carers, who spend close to 24 hours a day at the client’s bedside. Baker’s first ever end-of-life call was terrifying. The client was a woman in her 90s who had declined sharply in the space of 24 hours before plateauing again. Although Baker was paired with a more experienced carer, she was frightened that she would get something wrong. Now she doesn’t mind the end-of-life calls. If a doctor has determined one of her clients will soon die, Baker always wants to care for them if she can. Last autumn, when England was deep in its second national lockdown, Baker attended to Harry, who was more than 100. “He was lovely,” she says. “He always wanted to know if I was married.” Harry’s wife, Jill, was in hospital at the time. A relative was staying with them, but they would go out for breaks and leave their dog. Baker would sit with Harry, cuddling the dog. He would be asleep almost all of the time, but she would still talk to him, tell him about her day. “You don’t know if they can hear you, but sometimes knowing you are there can make them feel better,” she says. Towards the end, Harry would ask Baker if he was dying and tell her that he wanted to die. She would tell him that he was getting comfortable. When he died, in January 2021, Baker was relieved. “It sounds horrible to say this, but you just want them to be at peace,” she says. “Especially if they’re in pain.” Early December. Baker has been off sick with a chest infection. Although she is on a zero-hours contract, she got sick pay, which she is grateful for. She spent most of her time at home feeling guilty that she wasn’t working. “There were all these messages on the work chat: ‘Can you cover this shift?’ And I wanted to, but I couldn’t.” She kept reading the clients’ notes on the system, to see how they were doing – her boyfriend would tell her off and take the phone out of her hand. “When you don’t see clients, you worry about them,” she says. Now she is back – and working an extra 12 hours a week to make up for staffing shortages. “When new year comes, everything will calm down,” she says, hopefully. Baker has the boundless energy of a children’s TV presenter, but even she is flagging. Her low mood is compounded by the fact that one of her former clients, Jane, has just died. She had been living in a care home. They used to sing I Could Have Danced All Night, from the musical My Fair Lady, together. “That was our song,” she says. Jane was a joy to care for: vivacious and straight-talking. She would tell Baker she needed to get her roots done and chastised her for laying out outfits with clashing colours. But the lockdown hit Jane hard. She missed her daughter, who was unable to visit due to the restrictions. Baker says: “When she was able to visit, you’d never seen joy like it.” Baker didn’t get the chance to say goodbye to Jane: she was put into the care home at short notice. Mid-December. Baker is back at Dora’s house. One of her relatives recently died and the funeral is being livestreamed. They sit side by side and watch it, holding hands. Dora sings along to the hymn, which Baker finds so unexpectedly touching that it moves her to tears. Afterwards, they watch Catchphrase. Dora would have attended the funeral, but she is anxious about the Covid risk. Baker is also concerned. Omicron cases are rising and there is talk of another lockdown. “Isolation hit our clients really hard,” she says. “The ones with Alzheimer’s couldn’t understand why their families couldn’t visit. You’d explain it to them, but they wouldn’t remember. You’d have to be three different people to them at once: a care worker, a housekeeper and as close to a family member as possible, so they didn’t feel lonely.” Christmas Eve. Omicron is surging across the country, with 102,729 cases reported in England alone that day. Lateral flow tests seem to be unavailable to the general public. There are long queues at PCR testing centres. Baker works a 12-hour shift, from 7am to 7pm. She dresses in a sequined Christmas jumper featuring a dog wearing antlers. Her first client is a woman in her mid-80s who lives alone. The woman is distressed. Her relatives were meant to come to visit, but they can’t, because they have just tested positive for Covid. The woman tries to put on a brave face and tells Baker that it will be nice to have a quiet Christmas. “It breaks my heart,” she says. “I just wanted to scoop her up and bring her with me, as unfeasible as that is. I felt horrific leaving her.” Her second visit is to Jill. This will be her first Christmas without Harry. Baker talks to Jill while she showers, to take away the awkwardness, before rolling on her compression stockings and bringing her tea and toast. The walls of her one-bedroom flat in an assisted‑living facility are covered in black‑and-white photos of her and Harry on their wedding day. There is a framed letter from the Queen to commemorate their diamond anniversary. Baker runs home for a slice of pizza at lunch. She rarely eats lunch out; she can’t afford it on a care worker’s wage. If she must pick up something in between clients, it is a Tesco meal deal, which she eats in her car. Her phone pings constantly with messages from her family about Christmas plans. Baker will work Christmas morning and then drive to her parents’ house in Portsmouth for lunch. Care workers’ clients need them all year round, even on Christmas Day. “It only hits you when you stop,” she says. “Whenever I go to visit my family, I just sleep.” In the first week of January, four members of Baker’s team are off with Covid. Baker gets her booster, but she has a bad reaction. She is hot and can’t move her arm. She calls the office, but they tell her they can’t afford to be another care worker down, as they are so short-staffed. Baker pushes through, surviving on a few bites of food and cups of tea, then gets home and collapses into bed. “It was OK,” she insists, in a tone that suggests it was not. This is characteristic of Baker, who is a relentlessly sunny presence and fond of an archaic turn of phrase, referring to her favourite clients as “crackers” and telling them she will be back in a “tickety-boo”. Her sugary-sweet manner seldom slips; if it does, it is only for a second. (“I said to my boyfriend the other day: ‘I feel like an old lady. All I do is talk about the weather,’” she says.) When pressed, Baker will reluctantly suggest things that could make her life better. “It sounds really superficial, but I want a house and a family, and I don’t think I can do that on a job with an hourly wage,” she says, apologetically. More money would be helpful for lots of reasons, of course. When her car failed its MOT in 2019, her dad had to loan her £2,000 to buy a replacement. She can’t afford to go on foreign holidays and seldom takes time off; because she accrues holiday pay while working, it is too tempting to take the money instead of having a break. In her two and a half years of care work, her longest break has been a six-day camping trip in the UK. It is for this reason that she sometimes considers leaving for a better-paid job. Nursing would be the obvious choice: the care sector routinely loses staff to the NHS. “Because nursing is a regulated profession that requires qualifications, they are able to negotiate for higher pay,” says Prof Adam Gordon, an expert in the care of older people at the University of Nottingham. “There are no specific qualifications required to be a care worker. Historically, they have not unionised and haven’t been able to negotiate better pay.” Another factor, he says, is the makeup of the workforce. “It’s a predominantly female sector that’s been dependent on migrant labour. This type of work is undervalued in our society.” Because the domiciliary care sector is run on low margins, it is difficult for employers to increase pay and maintain profitability. “Conditions in the market are tempered by what local authorities are willing to pay,” explains Gordon. According to the market intelligence firm LaingBuisson, councils typically buy about 70% of home care hours from private providers. These rates are non‑negotiable and set by councils under considerable financial pressure, due to a decade of austerity – amounting to a real-world cut of about 50% to English local authority funding between 2010 and 2017. English councils pay an average of £18.54 an hour for social care. The minimum needed to comply with minimum wage laws and other associated costs is £21.43 an hour, meaning that many providers are making a loss when providing state-funded home care. “This is why employers struggle to increase wages,” says Townson at the Homecare Association. “Many would really love to do that. It’s actually no fun having your workforce leave every five minutes.” Turnover in the sector is chronically high, which creates a negative cycle: new care workers join, become overworked due to staff shortages, then leave almost immediately. “People tend to leave in the first month,” Baker says. “They try it, decide it’s not for them and move on.” Any leavers the NHS doesn’t vacuum up go to work in retail or hospitality, which offers similar pay without the stress and unsociable hours. “When I speak to people who run these agencies, the biggest threat to their employment is an Amazon opening down the road,” says Gordon. “Amazon offers golden handshake incentives of thousands of pounds. Domiciliary care can’t compete with that.” Of course, one way to stop care workers jumping ship would be to increase funding for the sector. But this is impossible without a significant investment from national governments. “Social care is the poor relative of the health service in the UK,” says Gordon. In September 2021, the UK government announced plans to raise the rate of national insurance by 1.25 percentage points, to raise an additional £12bn a year for health and social care. However, only £1.8bn a year of this will go to social care. The Health Foundation estimates that additional funding of between £3bn and £5bn a year is needed simply to stabilise the social care system over the coming years, without increasing pay or meeting future demand. To build resilience into the system and pay care workers a higher wage, £7bn to £9bn a year would be necessary. “That sounds like a big number to you or me,” says Townson. “But to put that into context, the government has spent at least £10bn on Covid [PPE] contracts. It is amazing how they can find the money when they want to.” The problems in the social care sector will only get worse, as our ageing population lives longer due to advances in medical science. “There will be more and more people needing complex care,” says Gordon. “We’re already struggling to recruit the staff we need.” But Baker isn’t planning to jump ship, at least for now. “Nursing seems more stressful and you spend less time with people,” she says. “And there’s more regulation.” She hasn’t ruled out teaching, but the training is expensive and time-consuming. Baker thinks she will stay in the care sector, but try to move into the office, in a salaried position. “I’d miss my clients, though,” she says. Baker bustles into Jill’s house. It is the second week of January and she has been up since 6am, –she had to de-ice the car because it is so cold. “Minus two when I got up this morning,” she bellows. (She has to project her voice, as most of her clients are hard of hearing.) They talk about the news: the lawsuit against Prince Andrew, mostly. Older people love to talk about the royal family. Baker finds it amusing when they say they feel sorry for the Queen, as if they know her personally. Her next visit is with Angie, who can be difficult, says Baker, euphemistically. Angie has dementia. “The last time I was there, she told me to go away. That is the polite way of putting it.” Angie would refuse care and tell Baker that she was an annoying child. Baker would sometimes have to leave the room to compose herself. “I don’t like being shouted at,” she says. “I will just cry.” The office placed a more experienced care worker into the call, to assist – such visits are called “double-ups” – and this helped to calm the situation. Angie’s husband, Jake, answers the door. He is a slim man, dressed neatly in a grey wool jumper. He is devoted to his wife. Angie’s care costs are considerable and the family is meeting them personally, out of her pension; she isn’t eligible for local authority support. The family didn’t want external help, but Angie had a few falls and they realised they had no choice. Even now, Jake rarely leaves her side for more than a few minutes. Sometimes he walks around the block for 30 minutes, when she is being washed by the evening carers. “She has been good to me,” he says, stroking Angie’s face lovingly. “Now it’s my turn to be good to her.” Baker washes and dresses Angie, apologising that her hands are cold. Later, she visits Tom, a 95-year-old second world war veteran who lives with his stepson. Tom is funny, independent and needs very little support. He cycles on his stationary exercise bike every day. Baker makes him lunch and they play rummy in the conservatory. He always insists on making her a cup of tea. Today, they talk about the allegations that Boris Johnson broke the lockdown rules. “I’m guilty, because I voted for him,” says Tom. They talk about the royal family. Tom once saw the Queen Mother stepping out of a Rolls-Royce in Brighton, when he was a child. He went home and told his mother, but she didn’t believe him. These are the moments when Baker truly loves her job. “He is the sweetest man,” she says. “You never see him upset. The whole team loves him. Just seeing him brightens your day.” Sometimes Tom plays Baker the piano. Sometimes they talk about the past. Tom served in the navy. He was on the first ship into Singapore after the atomic bombs. He saw the Australian prisoners of war, who had been held in the notorious Changi jail, lined up along the quay. “Sorry souls,” he says. At times like this, Baker feels that she has her hand in the cooling bathwater of the past. “I get to live through history with them,” she says. Baker knows that it is a privilege to do this job. She wishes that other people would see it the same way.

2/15/2022,"Sandwiched between two huge and populous nations: China to the north and India to the south, the landlocked Kingdom of Bhutan is crossed on its northern edge by the vast Himalayan mountain range. Indeed, its highest point, Gangkhar Puensum, is the highest unclimbed mountain in the world, at 7,570 metres (almost 25,000ft) above sea level. As a result of the country’s topography, where the altitude rises gradually from south to north, Bhutan has three distinct climate zones. In the southern lowlands, near the border with India, the climate is subtropical, with mild winters and temperatures rarely dropping into single figures and very hot summers, peaking from April through to September at about 30C to 32C.  In the hilly centre of the country, winters can be cold, while summers are warm and wet, especially during the summer monsoon; though some sheltered valleys escape the worst of the rains. Finally, at locations above 2,000 metres (6,500ft), such as the country’s largest city and capital, Thimphu, mean temperatures are about 5C in January, but can drop below freezing; but then rise to the low 20Cs in the summer months. Winters can bring snowfalls, while annual rainfall is about 1,400mm (55in) – again, because of the heavy rainfall during the summer monsoon.

Our power and the power of Earth are intrinsically bound in generosity and regeneration, not scarcity and sacrifice. Renewal, abundance, retreat and restoration are the seasons within us. But we forget what real power looks like – because the power of the patriarchy has disguised what hurts us as what we deserve. The assaults on my body are akin to the assaults wounding the body of Earth, but I am human and that alone makes me complicit in the degradation and sacrilege of Nature. Atonement is possible. The story my body wants to tell is that she is tired. She is tired of running on fumes, the same fumes killing the planet by burning coal and oil and gas. The story of my body is exhaustion. Am I listening? She is telling me that the energy I count on is a false energy, a lie sputtering from the flames of sheer will, fear and illusion. The story my body wants to tell is that she is grieving. She is sick from not being heard, or seen, or cared for, while I am taking care of everyone else except my own beloved body, my one and only body – flesh of my flesh called Earth. My body understands I take her for granted, and why wouldn’t I? We are conditioned, as women, to believe there is divine purpose in busyness and distraction – forgetting ourselves, forgetting the soul-needs of our children: the soil, the air, savannas and forests, wetlands and oceans.

She continues to construct my health and wellbeing in the blood and bones of my body, even as my nervous system registers danger and adrenal glands sound the alarm.

Our bodies and the body of Earth are changing quickly, alchemically, through the violence of climate collapse. We are supporting a collective death by suicide.

New rituals tapping the hearts of women worldwide are being born commensurate with this moment. Our ancestors are with us. With our hands on the Earth, we will know what to do. Earth care is self-care. The story my body wants to tell is a story of love. It is time to lay our bodies down on the Mother and defend her creation – we breathe – we breathe ourselves back into the insistence of Beauty. Our tears will fall as rain in the desert, in sorrow and relief. We will rise, drenched in joy, and lead. Our bodies on Earth, of Earth, for Earth will be fearless – keening and singing, chanting and dancing, circling the planet in defiance and prayer, as our stay against extinction, both human and wild.

2/15/2022,"Domestic abuse survivors will find it easier to move away from perpetrators under proposals unveiled by ministers. The plans, which are being put out to consultation, would see the so-called local connection test scrapped. The test can stop victims from applying for social housing if they do not have a connection to a local area, potentially forcing an abuse survivor to live in the same community as their abuser.  A second consultation will consider whether and how to change current rules that make it difficult for victims to remove their perpetrators from joint tenancies, which can mean victims either feel forced to stay in their home or are at risk of being made homeless by their abuser. Commenting on the consultation, Nicole Jacobs, the domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales, said: “It is vital that victims and survivors can access safe housing regardless of their tenure type. That means staying safely in their own home if they want to, as well as being able to access housing in a new area if they are no longer safe where they live.” The consultation was carried out as part of a wider announcement from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, which included further funding for councils to help domestic abuse survivors and their children. The funding will be used to ensure that safe accommodation spaces such as refuges and shelters can provide victims with vital support services including healthcare, social workers and benefits, the department said. Interpreters, immigration advice, drug or alcohol support and other specialist services will also be funded and made available. The funding will be issued as an non-ringfenced grant to councils, which will then be responsible for making decisions on how the funding is spent to benefit those in need. The safeguarding minister, Rachel Maclean, said: “Home is not the safe place it should be for domestic abuse victims and their families. The extra support provided today will provide a vital lifeline for victims as they try to rebuild their lives positively while feeling supported and protected.” The government’s Domestic Abuse Act 2021 placed a legal duty on councils to fund support in safe accommodation for all victims and their families. The money announced today will help pay for these services. In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women’s Aid.

2/15/2022,"Another week, another sewage outflow of corruption into the polluted river of Tory politics. Are voters so profoundly cynical that no political bribery or MPs touting for contracts shocks them? Polling suggests the country is not losing its sense of smell. The time may soon be here to take up John Major’s call in the Guardian to clean up party funding and stop dirty donations from distorting democracy. For that, the public has to swallow what it deplores: state funding for political parties. Every inquiry has concluded there is no alternative.  Here’s the latest filth: the Tories direct their biggest donors to apply for public posts controlled by a Downing Street unit hidden from public scrutiny. The Sunday Times reports “officials offering behind-the-scenes support and directing applicants to a secretive Number 10 unit”. That’s their win-win: collecting cash for the party while trying to pack Tories into appointments to public and arts bodies. This comes on top of openDemocracy revealing that donors giving £3m or more to the Tories are virtually guaranteed to be offered a peerage. The stink surrounding Tory fundraising leaks out in an email from its treasurer’s office telling their big donors: “We thought you may be interested in the latest list of public appointments. It is important Conservatives rebalance the representation at the head of these important public bodies.” The party’s donor club the Leaders’ Group charges a minimum of £50,000 a year for access to ministers. The Tory party co-chairman, Ben Elliot, the Duchess of Cornwall’s nephew, is founder of Quintessentially, a luxury concierge service offering “lifestyle management” for the ultra-wealthy. It boasts it can do anything: they once told me of delivering bongo drums to the bored teenage son of a billionaire on a yacht mid-Pacific; and paying a top Manchester United footballer to play with a plutocrat’s seven-year-old. That’s the world Elliot fishes in while he also guides donors to public appointments. The Times reports that Elliot told senior advisers at No 10 that one major donor would be an “excellent candidate” to oversee emergency Covid-19 loans. His staff lobbied for Mohamed Amersi, the telecoms millionaire and £750,000 Tory donor, to chair the National Lottery Community Fund; he made it to the last round of selection. This week Elliot’s fundraising comes under scrutiny when Amersi takes his feud with the Tory party to the high court in a libel claim against former Tory MP Charlotte Leslie for questioning the origins of his wealth. In all this murk, no one knows a donor’s true influence, but sometimes they break to the surface. Jonathan Leavesley, the chair of the secretive Midlands Industrial Council bankrolling the Tories and the Taxpayers’ Alliance, threatens their cash in the Daily Telegraph: “I have been a party donor through bad times as well as good, but my enthusiasm can ebb and flow.” Castigating the rise in national insurance contributions and corporation tax, Leavesley writes: “Have they never heard of the Laffer curve? It is time for the government to act as a free enterprise champion and act Conservative. Get a grip Boris, or go.” Other donors are on the rampage over Johnson’s failings, but it’s not for them to ordain his fate. Colossal power is wielded by dangerously few donors, says Brunel University’s Prof Justin Fisher, with just 10 people donating a quarter of Tory funds – more than £10m – since Johnson became prime minister. Particularly pernicious is Johnson’s elections bill abolishing the Electoral Commission’s power to prosecute illegal donations. Labour was always over-reliant on power-wielding union leaders. Unite’s leader, Sharon Graham, last week rattled her money bags in a crude threat over a dispute with bin lorry drivers in Labour-run Coventry. “Let me be very clear – the remaining financial support of the Labour party is now under review,” she said. Keir Starmer would have none of it: “The Labour party I lead is not going to be influenced by threats from anybody, whoever they are, and that is just an absolute matter of principle.” Fisher points to the 2019 general election, when Unite donated £4.6m of Labour’s £8.3m; the union has already cut funding after Jeremy Corbyn’s departure. This politicking ignores union members’ interests, since Labour’s strongest policies include fair pay deals in every sector, ending zero hours insecurity and guaranteeing every workplace access to union recruiters. Unlike secret Tory influencers, at least Unite’s attempt at cash-for-influence is rudely transparent. John Major rose to a tremendous philippic against Boris Johnson’s corruptions, though as prime minister he was no Cicero. As ever with former prime ministers, you sigh at their retrospective wisdom, regretting radical reforms they never dared, such as party funding. “The system needs cleansing,” he writes, to stop politics being “the plaything of the rich or of pressure groups”. Limit donations by individuals and unions so donors no longer “sway policy through an open cheque book”. The last review in 2011, by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, called for capped donations, with state funding at 50p a year per voter. But Nick Clegg slaughtered it at birth in the Commons, saying austerity spending couldn’t afford it. Deep public mistrust means politicians fear asking taxpayers to foot the bill, though political parties are essential to a functioning democracy: less than 2% of the electorate ever join a party. The best idea for distributing state cash came from the Power Inquiry, chaired by Helena Kennedy: voters at elections should allocate a £3 state voucher to any party. That too was killed stone dead. Plummeting polls show the limit to how much voters “priced in” corruption with Johnson. Enough is enough, the country hasn’t run out of outrage. Whoever inherits Johnson’s filthy stables can only make a clean break by purging political funding.

2/15/2022,"The Bank of England is facing fierce criticism from both sides over its plans to raise interest rates. For hawkish economists, Threadneedle Street has fallen badly behind the curve, miscalculating the rise of inflationary pressures, and now needs to play catch-up to regain credibility. Others say the Bank is navigating the most dangerous moment for the economy in decades, but now risks a huge policy mistake. They argue that driving up borrowing costs will have little effect on inflation caused by global supply chain disruption, and that it risks engineering the conditions for a recession in an economy still grappling with Covid-19 and struggling for momentum.  Each side fears that a lack of coherent strategy either way will fatally undermine the central bank’s credibility. Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC), said a steady rise in interest rates last year, clearly communicated to financial markets, would have been a sensible reaction to rising prices, and he criticised the Bank for a kneejerk response. “They’ve sent conflicting messages on monetary policy since last November, and they seem to have lurched from being very cautious to being seen to want to act. But it’s still not clear what strategy they’re going to be following in the future.” With inflation poised to hit more than triple the Bank’s 2% target rate come April – rising to about 7% – City investors are betting that the MPC will add several more interest rate rises to one in December and another this month in an attempt to restore its credibility after waiting and watching for too long last year. The Bank governor, Andrew Bailey, was criticised as being out of touch when he urged workers this month not to demand big pay rises. Financial markets expect rates to reach 2% by the end of the year, the highest in more than a decade, since rates sank close to zero during the 2008 financial crisis. Roger Bootle, chairman of the consultancy Capital Economics, told MPs on the Commons Treasury committee last week that the Bank was “way behind the curve”, breeding a mismatch between the degree of tightening of policy and how quickly the inflation danger was picking up. “The Bank has not communicated clearly enough how tough it may need to be,” he said. Official figures are expected to confirm on Wednesday an inflation rate of close to 5.4% in January, the highest level in three decades. The Bank has said the measure for the annual increase in the cost of living could peak at about 7.25% by April as surging energy prices feed through. “Out of the blue, for the first time in 20 years, inflation comes powering ahead, way above what they dreamed of, and they are like: ‘Oh my God,’” Jim O’Neill, the former Treasury minister who sits as a crossbench peer in the House of Lords, told MPs at the same hearing. O’Neill, a former chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said acting too fast could exacerbate the damage. “At this point they have to get out of that dilemma, but they now run the classic risk, for those who have been around long enough, that they might end up going too much in completely the wrong way, just to get their own credibility back,” he said. On the Bank’s own forecasts, it anticipates unemployment rising from the current rate of 4.1% to 5% by early 2025 as the economic outlook deteriorates due to weak real income growth and fading consumer demand. Helped by higher interest rates, inflation is forecast to fall back below target to 1.5%. Despite the risks to the economy, Karen Ward, a former adviser to Philip Hammond when he was chancellor, and now the chief market strategist for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at JP Morgan Asset Management, said Threadneedle Street was still likely to prioritise protecting growth. “They’re walking a tightrope between maintaining their credibility and showing that they will not tolerate such high inflation, but not being so heavy-handed that they short-circuit the recovery. On that balancing act, I feel they’ll err on the side of inflation rather than [damaging] growth” she said. It’s possible to be too critical of policymakers when they are coping with a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, said Neil Shearing, chief economist at the global consultancy Capital Economics. “There is lots of gnashing of teeth about inflation at the moment. And there is an argument that governments and central banks have over-stimulated their economies, triggering higher prices than would have been the case. But in the 2008 financial crash they were rightly criticised for not providing enough stimulus, and that mistake led to a much worse situation in the years that followed.” Dario Perkins, the head of global macroeconomics at the consultancy TS Lombard, said the BoE should not be blamed for the rise in inflation. He believes it was sensible to maintain ultra-low rates last year while the economy recovered from the pandemic. “However, the bank’s credibility is at stake now as it starts to increase interest rates without a good reason for doing so,” he said. Ben Broadbent, the Bank’s deputy governor, has tackled criticism of the Bank head on, saying the economy was weak last year and continued to need low interest rates. He has justified the turnaround since December by arguing that the Bank needs to clamp down on early signs that workers, keen to limit the damage from rising inflation, are demanding higher wages, triggering a wage/price spiral. Perkins, a senior Treasury economist during the 2008 crash, described the concern about spiralling wages variously as “ridiculous”, “spurious” and “fake”. It’s a view that goes to the heart of the Bank’s dilemma. It also potentially undermines the credibility of the central bank’s regional agents, who underpin the Bank’s forecasts of future earnings and have reported that wage increases are already running hot across the country. “I think with every move it makes, the MPC is trying to convince us that despite two years of unexplained policy changes, and despite appearing to embark on a new and undeclared policy of financing government debt, despite an economy showing no sign of above-average wage growth, it remains a credible and independent policymaking body,” said Perkins. “It is when this defensive mindset takes over that policy mistakes are possible.” Rupert Harrison, George Osborne’s chief economic adviser from 2006 to 2015, said all central banks were in danger of making their first major mistake. “[It] really feels like central bankers around the world are making a collective policy mistake – trying to use rapid rate rises to cool inflation that is driven mainly by supply constraints, just as growth momentum is slowing,” he tweeted. “Only in the US can you see anything like the hot labour market that would justify significant tightening – I really struggle to understand the Bank of England’s reasoning today.” Robert Skidelsky, a peer who sits on the Lords economics affairs committee, said the central bank was struggling to maintain a fiction that it was independent from Treasury policymaking. “It is terrified of losing its credibility as an independent central bank, but cannot admit that it has become like an agency of the Treasury. Now it is trying to act independently and yet its dual mission – to bring down inflation while also fostering growth – leaves its policymaking in disarray.” Danny Blanchflower, a former member of theMPC, believes a series of missteps through the pandemic mean the Bank’s credibility is “totally shot”. He said: “Since the time the Bank was made independent [in 1997], I don’t think we’ve seen anything so bad.” Blanchflower said higher unemployment was riskier than above-target inflation. “The danger is they’re going to generate a recession,” he said.",News/Business,Credibility challenge: Bank of England walks a tightrope on interest rates,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/15/credibility-challenge-bank-of-england-walks-a-tightrope-on-interest-rates
2/15/2022,"Health officials have “paid lip service” to racism in the NHS for years, leading black, Asian and minority ethnic doctors have warned as they called for “concrete” action to tackle inequalities exposed by a landmark review. The Guardian revealed how a damning study – the largest of its kind – had found “vast” and “widespread” inequity in every aspect of healthcare it reviewed, and warned that this was harming the health of minority ethnic patients in England.  In response, an NHS spokesperson said the health service was “already taking action” to improve the experiences of patients and access to services and was working “to drive forward” the recommendations made in the report. However, Dr JS Bamrah, a consultant psychiatrist in Greater Manchester and national chairman of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, said he was unsatisfied with the response. “This 166-page review … is a terrible indictment of the current state of the NHS,” he told the Guardian. “As many of us have often said and reported, we don’t need any further reports. It’s action we need, as there are scores of patients who are not getting optimal treatment, and many are being neglected. “It really isn’t good enough for NHS bosses to say that action is being taken and it’s even more disappointing to then not see any concrete proposals on dealing with glaring disparities despite all that we have learnt during the pandemic.” Dr Rajesh Mohan, presidential lead for race and equality at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said it was “time for warm words to end” as he urged NHS leaders to “do everything they can to ensure patients from ethnic minority backgrounds get the care they need”. Dr Subramanian Narayanan, president-elect of the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association, the hospital doctors’ union, said “the blight of institutional racism” was “all too common” in the NHS, adding: “Health leaders have paid lip service to racism for years, but that has got us nowhere.” The review, commissioned by the NHS Race and Health Observatory and led by the University of Manchester, made a series of recommendations to NHS leaders and organisations. They include, for example, improving ethnicity data collection, investing in racial health inequalities research, fostering better links with community organisations and tackling “racist attitudes and behaviours” among healthcare staff. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association, said: “The findings show that people from ethnic minority backgrounds are being failed within the health service across all age groups and clinical areas. As patients receive poorer care on the basis of race the NHS is failing to honour its core value; to treat everyone equally. This can no longer be ignored – there is a moral duty to put this right as matter of urgency.” An NHS spokesperson said: “While our latest equality report shows that progress has been made in some areas of the NHS, we are working with the GMC and NHS Employers to ensure that we are addressing these concerns and have appointed senior leaders to take this work forward and monitor progress. “The NHS has also set out what local health services should be focusing on over the next year so they can also make improvements in their local communities for patients and will work closely with the Race and Health Observatory to drive forward the recommendations set out in this report.”",News/Society,Doctors call for action not words from NHS in response to racial inequality report,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/15/doctors-call-for-action-not-words-from-nhs-in-response-to-racial-inequality-report
2/15/2022,"One of the last remaining countries without Covid-19 - the small Pacific nation of Cook Islands - has reported its first case of the virus. Prime minister Mark Brown said the first case arrived on an international flight from New Zealand on 10 February.  “While she was asymptomatic, she returned a positive result in just a few hours later. The case been issued an Isolation Order. The case is travelling with two others, and they will all remain in isolation until they no longer test positive for Covid-19,” Brown said on Monday. The prime minister warned on the weekend there could be “silent transmission” in the country after another traveller tested positive for Covid-19 upon their return to New Zealand, having travelled through the Cook Islands from 31 January to 8 February. “It is likely that the person who tested positive was infectious while here and further likely that the virus is in our community,” the prime minister said of that case on social media on Saturday. Hundreds of people came forward for testing at drive-through sites on Tuesday in an effort to trace any possible community transmission. Te Marae Ora, the Cook Islands Ministry of Health, confirmed that 31 potential close contacts had tested negative. The Cook Islands – a popular holiday destination with a population of about 18,000 people – has kicked into full precautionary measures which include grounding outer island flights to contain any possible transmission in Rarotonga, the main island. Despite this being the first case, there is no sense of panic, according to Rashneel Kumar, editor of the national newspaper, Cook Islands News. “People are calm and collected. Maybe if this case arrived sooner it would have been different. But people have been prepared and practising social distance, wearing masks and taking precautionary measures. It also helps that vaccination coverage is very high.” The vaccination coverage in the Cook Islands is 96% of the eligible population 12 years and over, according to Te Marae Ora. The positive case comes a week after vaccines for five-11-year-olds were rolled out, and a week after reopening of all schools. Kumar told the Guardian that some parents expressed concern about schools being open, while others were comfortable to keep their children in school while they wait for test results.",News/World news,Cook Islands reports first Covid case amid fears of ‘silent transmission’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/cook-islands-reports-first-covid-case-amid-fears-of-silent-transmission
2/15/2022,"Switzerland’s Mathilde Gremaud soared to gold in the Olympic women’s freeski slopestyle final after holding off another last-gasp charge by Eileen Gu, the American-born emerging superstar representing China who settled for silver by the narrowest of margins but stayed on course for a historic treble at the Beijing Games. The 22-year-old Gremaud, who snuck into the final with the 12th-highest score in qualifying and scored a meagre 1.00 on her first of three runs in Tuesday’s final after losing a ski, roared back with an 86.56 on her second of three runs to leapfrog the gaggle of favourites atop the leaderboard.  Gu was in eighth place after taking a tumble on her second run, but the San Francisco-born freestyler competing for her mother’s home nation of China delivered under pressure once again, putting down a clean, controlled final run for a score of 86.23 – a scant 0.33 points behind Gremaud – to add a silver medal to her big air gold from last week. Kelly Sildaru took home bronze, becoming the first athlete from Estonia to win an Olympic medal in freestyle skiing on a bitterly cold -22C (-7F) morning in the mountain village of Taizicheng roughly 120km northwest of Beijing. The British pair of Kirsty Muir and Katie Summerhayes finished eighth and ninth respectively. “It really came down to the last run again,” Gu said. “I don’t know why I keep doing it to myself. It doesn’t make it easy for myself. It certainly doesn’t make it easy for my coaches and my mom has a heart attack every day. It’s definitely not the easiest but I’m happy that I was able to push through and turn that pressure into fuel and it feels so, so good.” Eleven entrants competed in the three-run final on Tuesday with the best score counting towards their final position, the frigid conditions further complicating their attempts down the 665m course filled with rails and jumps, which featured a carved-out replica of China’s Great Wall designed to protect the runners from strong westerly winds. Gu has flashed her ability to deliver under pressure repeatedly throughout these Olympics. The 18-year-old was in danger of missing the big air final entirely after a ski popped off on her second run but confidently landed her final attempt, then won the gold from third place entering her final run by throwing down a 1620, a four-and-a-half-revolution manoeuvre that she had never even attempted in practice much less in competition. When Monday’s slopestyle qualifying finally took place after a 24-hour postponement, Gu avoided a shock exit after an error-strewn opening attempt with an impressive run to book her place in the final. Then on Tuesday, Gu fell on her second run after over-rotating on the third rail and dropped into eighth. She responded with a standout run featuring a double-cork 900 punctuated by a Buick grab that came within hundreds of catching Gremaud, who took the silver four years ago in Pyeongchang less than 36 hours after suffering a head injury in a training crash. “I think I was feeling a little bit tired mentally after big air,” Gu said. “In my first and second run I wasn’t fully in it. I wasn’t in the zone, I wasn’t feeling that rush, that excitement. I felt almost too calm, which sometimes doesn’t work out the best. I’m one of those people that kind of needs to have the pressure on and I was happy that I was able to put it down.” Gu remains on track to become the first action-sports athlete to capture three medals at a single Winter Olympics. She is a hot favourite in the halfpipe competition, which starts with qualifying on Thursday, having scored a World Cup win in the discipline this season.",Sport/Sport,‘Mentally tired’ Eileen Gu claims silver as Mathilde Gremaud roars back for gold ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/15/mentally-tired-eileen-gu-claims-silver-as-mathilde-gremaud-roars-back-for-gold
