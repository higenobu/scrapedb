3/5/2022,"The rugged west coast is where some of Ibiza’s biggest adventures are to be found. The rocky headlands are covered in forests, occasionally dipping down to stunning beaches, and much of this area is accessible only on foot. The remote Ses Balandres beach is reached via ladders and ropes down an almost sheer cliff, after a long hike. Further along the coast, after another challenging hike, you can discover the deep and alluring sea cave of Na Coloms. It’s possible to climb or jump into a deep turquoise pool, but the only way out is to swim through an underwater tunnel to the foot of the cliffs, before climbing back up the hill. Cala d’Albarca is a rocky cove with lovely clear water. It is a bit of a hike to get to and a steep scramble down, but the path descends through a beautiful forest and past a natural stone bridge, the Puente de Piedra. Travelling inland from here is like stepping back in time. The tiny villages of Santa Agnès de Corona and Santa Mateu have changed little for centuries, their narrow streets of whitewashed cottages opening on to village squares with enormous churches. Much of this area is still given over to farming, the dark red soil rich with orchards and vineyards. Olive groves, carob, fig and almond trees are surrounded by low, drystone walls. The river valley of Es Broll contains an ancient Arabic irrigation system and the old forest trails are a wonder to explore, with surprising waterfalls that appear only after heavy rain. Stay and eat The centre of the island is where most of the best places to stay are located. Centuries-old farmhouses converted into stylish agroturismos, such as Can Pujolet (doubles from €240), offer typical Ibizan charm and style in peace and quiet, while the simple, stylish boutique Hotel Las Mariposas (doubles from €184) sits in quiet countryside but is a short hop from the airport and ferry terminal.Back on the west coast, the headland of Punta Galera juts out from an old stone quarry, offering a prime viewpoint for stunning sunsets. At nearby Cap Negret, Hostal La Torre (doubles from €57) is a boutique hotel with a stylish restaurant and bar, set high on cliffs – another spectacular sunset spot. Cala Gracioneta just south of here is a superb, tiny beach with a stylish chiringuito (beach bar) serving dishes from a wood-fired oven, and amazing cocktails. You can snorkel from here to the slightly larger beach at Cala Gració, enjoying the view of an abundance of fish as you go. Much of the coastline to the north of the Menorcan capital Mahón, or Maó, is uninhabited and can only be reached on foot or by boat, so it’s perfect for a wild adventure. This area is dominated by the S’Albufera des Grau natural park, which is part of a Unesco biosphere reserve. The diverse ecosystem includes a huge lagoon, marshlands, beaches, dune systems, woodland and little islets. Booted eagle, Egyptian vulture, osprey, red kite, wood warbler and red crossbill are among the birdlife. The ancient Camí de Cavalls trail, which runs around the entire coastline, goes right through the park, giving a clear route to most of the beaches, and marked trails lead off to the lagoon, bird hides and stunning viewpoints. Walking the section of the Camí de Cavalls between the lighthouse at Cap de Favàritx and the tiny village of Es Grau takes about three to four hours and passes through some of the island’s most beautiful, remote landscapes. The trail winds through shady woodland with ancient, twisted olive trees and open scrubby land scented by wild rosemary and juniper bushes. It passes beaches such as Cala Tortuga, Es Bol Llarg and Cala Rambles, whose turquoise waters are perfect for a cooling dip, but there are no facilities for many kilometres, so take plenty of water and food. Es Grau is a good spot to start or end your walk, as there is a lovely little chiringuito on the shore, selling cold drinks and simple, local food. The beach is sheltered and very shallow, so perfect for young children. You can hire kayaks or standup paddleboards from a beach shack and paddle out to the uninhabited Illa d’en Colom, or explore one of the fabulous beaches just up the coast. Stay and eat There aren’t many places to stay within the park, but Sa Torre Blanca (doubles from €98) is great option – a 14th-century tower with simple apartments, and the ruins of a megalithic village nearby. The city of Maó is five miles away, with plenty of accommodation. Just to the south of Maó, the tranquil, 400-year-old rural hotel Alcaufar Vell (doubles from €158) has retained the charm of the original farmhouse and has a restaurant in the garden. The hotel has created a three-mile walking or running route around its 250-hectare (620-acre) grounds, where guests can forage for wild mushrooms in season. There are also bikes to borrow. The northern part of Llevant is often compared to the Highlands of Scotland for its wide-open spaces, mountains and crags. This is the Llevant Peninsula natural park, a beautiful, undeveloped wilderness covered in fan palms, holm oak, pine trees and wild grasses, and crisscrossed by goat tracks and old pathways through forests and along vertiginous cliff tops. Here you can climb to dramatic viewpoints then drop down to hidden coves and remote, secret beaches on the wild north coast, such as Cala Torta, Cala Matzoc and Font Celada, which are only accessible on foot, bike or horseback and remain clean and unspoiled. In this haven for wildlife, booted eagles, peregrine falcons and even ospreys can be seen flying high overhead, while tortoises, cat-like genets, pine martens and Algerian hedgehogs take refuge in the dense woods and scrub. In the small town of Arta, the Tuesday market offers home-grown and artisanal produce, strings of multicoloured chillies, olives, cheeses, oils and seasonal fruit and vegetables. On the outskirts of the village is the ancient settlement of Ses Paisses, one of the oldest and best-preserved Talayotic (bronze age) sites in the Balearics, at over 2,000 years old. From the little village of Colónia de Sant Pere, a coastal trail called the Avinguda Colon leads north to the hidden beaches of Cala Na Clara, Cala d’es Torrent and Platja des Calo, with the mountains on one side and the sea on the other. Further west along the coast is the Son Real agricultural estate and old manor house (admission free), with a visitor centre and bike hire. Apart from the museum, and beautifully managed grounds with crops and livestock, there are well-maintained trails around the estate and down to a magnificent coast, where there is an astonishing necropolis right on the shore. It is said to be at least 2,700 years old, and comprises more than 100 grave sites. You can walk all the way to the seaside village of Son Serra from here and hardly see a soul. Natura Cavall is an adventure horse-riding company with rescue horses, which offers treks along this beach, and even swimming with the horses. Stay and eat Down a little side street in Artà is the charming boutique hotel Jardi D’Artà (doubles from €145), with beautiful courtyards and delicious breakfasts. Café Parisien in the town’s central square has a delightful garden and simple, local menu with a French twist. In Son Serra, El Sol is a popular beachside bar/restaurant right on the sand serving delicious, fresh meals with a sea view. The south coast of Mallorca is known for its relaxed atmosphere and long stretches of clear turquoise water. It also offers plenty of exciting caves to explore, and headland lookout points with stunning views. A hike in either direction from the lighthouse of Far des Cap de Ses Salines, the most southerly tip, takes you to some of the island’s most spectacular hidden beaches. A tough, three-mile hike east along the wild headland is sandy Caló des Màrmols, with clear waters and a great cave to swim into. Hike west from the same starting point and you’ll reach Platja des Caragol, the most southerly sandy beach on the island. Flanked by dunes and protected by a natural rock pier, this long, white beach is superbly quiet and wild. Visible on the horizon are the protected islands of the Cabrera archipelago, inhabited only by park rangers. You can get a permit to go ashore and explore this remote, unspoiled nature reserve, and the boat excursion from the port of Colónia de St Jordi provides a chance to spot dolphins and whales, too. Parc Natural Es Trenc, on the west coast of the Migjorn area, is the second-largest wetland area in Mallorca. A wild landscape of perfectly adapted coastal plants, it’s a paradise for the birds that rest and nest here, including flamingos, sea eagles and waders. Behind the sands of Platja d’es Trenc, the longest beach on the island, lies a unique area of protected dunes and 140 salt ponds, which are still harvested today. It is a fabulous spot for watching the bird life and enjoying the sunset over the Tramuntana mountain range. Inland, this largely rural area is dotted with market towns such as Campos, Llucmajor, Santanyí and Felanitx, with dozens of small villages scattered among them – offering rustic cafes, local markets and quiet, authentic charm. Much of the land is cultivated for crops such as beans, coffee, rice, sugar cane and cocoa. There is also a Talayotic site at Capocorb Vell. Stay and eat Finca Es Turó (doubles from €120, just north of the village of Ses Salines, has an infinity pool looking out to the coast from a high viewpoint, and extensive gardens draped with bougainvillea. For weary travellers, Fontsanta Hotel & Spa north-west of Ses Salines (doubles from €223) features the island’s only natural thermal spa, in use since 1869. A converted windmill in the heart of the tiny village of Santanyí is home to a glorious hidden gem: Es Molí, a flower-filled garden restaurant serving typical Mallorcan dishes. S’Embat, near Platja Es Trenc, is a perfect evening venue, with live music, loved by locals, as it serves simple, hearty food at tables on the sand, under canvas festooned with ribbons and fairy lights. The smallest of the main four Balearics, Formentera is around 13 miles long, with no airport. Although regular ferries from Ibiza take only 25-60 minutes, opportunities to hire or bring over cars are very limited. Thankfully, the island is relatively flat, with lots of little country lanes leading to beaches, coves and villages, and there are several car-free cycling and walking “green routes”. A free map of the green routes can be downloaded from formentera.es and bikes and mopeds can be hired from near the ferry terminal from €10 a day. There’s no better way to take in the beauty of the landscape, the tantalising strips of turquoise water and white, powdery sand, the towering cliffs, the whitewashed houses and the dusty tracks. Cap de Barbaria lighthouse lies at the most southerly point of the island, close to what was once known as the Barbary Coast in Algeria, about 65 miles away. The long, straight road to the lighthouse traverses a lunar-like landscape, and passes an almost hidden ancient settlement, the megalithic Cap de Barbaria, At nearly 4,000 years old, these sites are worth a detour. To the right of the lighthouse is Sa Cova Foradada, a hole in the ground with a little ladder leading into a large, dark cave. Walk through the cave and you come right to the cliff face and stunning sea views. The nature reserve of Can Marroig has a visitor centre as well as a picnic and barbecue area in the forest. Explore the headland and the forest trails from here, including Punta de Sa Pedrera, an old quarry site on the coast with tidal pools, caves and interesting rock formations – a perfect, quiet spot for snorkelling and swimming. Es Caló is a beautiful fishing village with a tiny natural harbour surrounded by traditional fishing huts. Wander along the boardwalks that protect the dunes to find a quiet spot for a swim in the silky, turquoise water. Stay and eat For a good central base, the small, stylish, family-run Hotel Es Marès (doubles from €210) is in the old town of St Francesc and has a beautiful spa and rooftop pool. The agrotourism boutique hotel Es Pas (doubles from €120) is on farmland near Es Caló, surrounded by olive and fig trees and with a glorious sea view. Watch the sun go down with a cocktail at the quirky, windmill-topped beach bar high up in the rocks at Chiringuito Cala Saona, or visit Juan y Andrea on the beautiful Playa Illetes, on the northern tip of the island, which has possibly the best beachside location on Formentera and serves amazing paella.This is an extended extract from Wild Guide Balearic Islands by Anna Deacon and Lizzie Graham, published by Wild Things on 1 March, £18.99.

3/5/2022,"On Monday, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that the dangerous impacts of climate breakdown are already being felt and are accelerating rapidly. Has that message been heard? The second of four parts of the IPCC’s sixth assessment report, the latest comprehensive review of our knowledge of the climate crisis, was termed by some scientists “the bleakest warning yet”. Half of the world’s people are “highly vulnerable” to serious impacts from the climate crisis, a billion people in coastal areas face inundation, mass die-offs of species including trees and coral have already begun, and close to a tenth of the world’s farmland is set to become unsuitable for agriculture. By any standards, these are stark and brutal findings. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said: “I have seen many scientific reports in my time, but nothing like this. Today’s IPCC report is an atlas of human suffering, and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership.” But the report has been overshadowed, understandably, by the war in Ukraine, and has received less policymaker and media attention than it deserved. That does not mean the IPCC report will be ignored. Governments are working on their responses to the scientists’ warnings, and later this year at the next UN climate summit, Cop27, they are obliged to lay out their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Cop27 is to be held this November in Egypt, a country that has forged strong diplomatic and economic ties with Russia in the recent past. Any meetings among the G20 major economies will also take place under the shadow of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, insiders point out that the climate negotiations have gone on for 30 years, despite wars and other conflicts among UN nations. Climate diplomats are practised at keeping other geopolitical tensions at least partly at bay. Perhaps of even greater relevance to the climate crisis will be the decisions governments make on energy policy in response to the Ukraine war. This week, the International Energy Agency urged a suite of actions – from households turning down their thermostats by 1C to windfall taxes on energy companies and the rapid construction of new wind and solar power generation – that could reduce the EU’s reliance on Russian gas by a third or more. The other options open to policymakers if Vladimir Putin turns off gas supplies to Europe would include a return to coal-fired power generation, the dirtiest form of fossil fuel. The choices that governments make now, ahead of next winter, will have profound consequences for the climate crisis. One of the key messages of the IPCC working group 2 report is that climate change is already occurring, all over the world. Even if we succeed in limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C, the limit countries agreed to target at Cop26 in Glasgow last November, we will still face more extreme weather, droughts, floods, heatwaves and sea level rises. The IPCC made clear that countries must seek to adapt now to these changes, to stave off the worst damage. Adaptation can mean building seawalls and river barriers, planting trees on hillsides to stop landslips amid floods, conserving or regrowing mangrove swamps to absorb the impact of coastal storm surges, painting roofs white to reflect the sun’s heat, or making buildings and built infrastructure such as telecommunications networks, roads and railways more resilient to extreme weather. Far too little effort has gone into adaptation up to now, the IPCC found. Rich countries promised last year at Cop26 to double their funding for adaptation in the poor world, but nearly all countries are still badly prepared. No. There are “hard limits” to adaptation, the IPCC made clear: the impacts of temperatures rising unchecked would overcome all our efforts to adjust. Flood barriers may hold back a river in spate today, but as the icecaps and glaciers melt, as heatwaves take hold, and as droughts threaten agriculture, we will face too many threats and they will grow too severe for any adaptation effort to allow life to proceed as normal. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions urgently, to stop temperatures rising further, must still be the priority, according to the IPCC. Early next month, the IPCC will release the third part of its four-part assessment, by working group 3, covering “mitigation” – the ways in which countries can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This includes renewable energy generation, energy efficiency, alternatives to fossil fuels such as nuclear power, and novel technologies, such as carbon capture and storage and direct air capture of carbon dioxide. Working group 3 will set out pathways and policy choices governments could take to reach the goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C, including some of the likely costs and economic benefits of those choices. After that, a “synthesis report” drawing together all three parts of the IPCC’s sixth assessment will be published in October, for policymakers to discuss at Cop27.",News/Environment,Q&A: Has the IPCC’s bleak warning of climate breakdown been heard?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/05/qa-has-the-ipccs-bleak-warning-of-climate-breakdown-been-heard
3/5/2022,"The photograph is a study in contrasts. On the left, standing stiffly and staring glumly, is Mitch McConnell, 80, the Republican minority leader in the Senate accused of committing professional fouls when confronting judicial confirmations. On the right, at a slightly awkward distance from McConnell, is Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, 51, chosen by a Democratic president to be the first Black woman on the US supreme court, smiling warmly at the camera, her posture more relaxed than the senator’s. This was one stop for Jackson this week when she began courting senators from both sides of the aisle ahead of nomination hearings that start on 21 March before a vote in the full chamber. For McConnell, who blocked President Barack Obama’s 2016 nominee Merrick Garland then oversaw the confirmation of three conservative justices under President Donald Trump, there are few options this time. Democrats can confirm Jackson without Republicans in a Senate that is divided 50-50 and where Vice-President Kamala Harris wields the tiebreaker vote. Experts predict that Republicans will use the process to score some political points – just as Democrats did in 2020 when they were powerless to block Amy Coney Barrett’s ascent to the court – but ultimately they will not resort entirely to scorched earth tactics. McConnell and colleagues know that Jackson is replacing a fellow liberal, the retiring Stephen Breyer, and so will not change the 6-3 conservative majority on the court. They are also aware that opinion polls suggest a thumping Republican victory in November’s midterm elections and do not want to risk an overreach that might change that trajectory. “It would be difficult for the Republicans to stop it and a very strong, aggressive effort to block her confirmation could be perceived as being racially motivated,” said Edward Fallone, an associate professor at Marquette University Law School. “They’re already in a favorable position for the midterm elections and the last thing they want to do is erode that by getting accused of being racist at this time. So they should just stay out of the way.” But that will not necessarily prevent some Republicans using racist dog whistles to rile up the Trump base, as they have before. At a confirmation hearing last November, for example, the Republican senator John Kennedy told Kazakh-born Saule Omarova, nominee for comptroller of the currency: “I don’t mean any disrespect: I don’t know whether to call you professor or comrade.” She replied: “Senator, I’m not a communist.” Fallone commented: “There are certainly going to be the Republican loose cannons but the question would be whether one of the more mainstream Republicans slips up and makes a comment that’s perceived as racist.” There was an early preview of the potential for bigotry this week when, after Biden championed Jackson in his State of the Union address as “one of our nation’s top legal minds”, Tucker Carlson, an influential host on the conservative Fox News network, remarked: “It might be time for Joe Biden to let us know what Ketanji Brown Jackson’s LSAT score was.” LSAT is the Law School Admission Test. Critics noted that Carlson never made a similar demand for the LSAT scores of white justices appointed by Trump. Jackson has served since last year on the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit after eight years as a federal district judge in Washington and worked earlier as a supreme court clerk for Breyer. She is related by marriage to the former House speaker Paul Ryan, now a board member at the parent company of Fox News. Democrats hope to confirm her before the Easter recess starts on 11 April. She was accompanied this week by Doug Jones, a civil rights lawyer and former senator from Alabama. After a 40-minute meeting, the Democratic majority leader, Chuck Schumer, told reporters: “She deserves support from the other side of the aisle, and I am hopeful that a good number of Republicans will vote for her, given who she is.” But McConnell has raised questions about Jackson’s short record as an appellate judge, which includes only two opinions so far. “I am troubled by the combination of this slim appellate record and the intensity of Judge Jackson’s far-left, dark-money fan club,” the senator from Kentucky said. It was a clue that the days when supreme court justices were confirmed with more than 90 bipartisan votes are long gone and that most Republicans are likely to oppose Jackson, despite her receiving support from the Fraternal Order of Police and former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. Even so, few predict a bareknuckle fight that will dominate national headlines like the confirmation hearing for Brett Kavanaugh, who faced allegations of sexual misconduct from his teenage years. Christopher Kang, co-founder and chief counsel of the progressive pressure group Demand Justice, said: “They have nothing to turn it into a battle over. At the end of the day, Republicans still control a supermajority of the supreme court so the substantive stakes are not there for them. “There’s nothing in Judge Jackson’s record that they could turn into a rallying cry on their side either so I do think that it will be a somewhat muted battle. Or perhaps, as too often seen with women of color who are judicial nominees, unfortunately it may end up devolving into some racist and misogynist attacks. But it won’t be based on her record at all.” Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina were the only Republicans to vote to confirm Jackson to the appeals court last year. While Collins appears open to voting for Jackson again, Murkowski has said her previous vote did not mean she would be supportive this time. Graham had advocated for a different candidate from his home state, federal judge Michelle Childs, and expressed disappointment that she was not Biden’s pick. But, along with rightwing media, some outside advocacy conservative organisations are attacking Jackson’s nomination. The Judicial Crisis Network (JCN) has launched a $2.5m campaign trying to make the case that a “liberal dark money network” helped get Biden elected, pressured Breyer to retire and is now seeking to replace him with “a rubber stamp for their unpopular and far-left political agenda”. Curt Levey, president of the conservative Committee for Justice, said: “The strategy on our side is not to really try to stop her but to try to make some larger points. I think JCN is making a point about dark money groups pressuring Biden to choose the most progressive of the three choices [the other frontrunners were Childs and California supreme court justice Leondra Kruger].” Levey’s own group does not see it as worthwhile to spend money on TV adverts, however. “We can be effective on those larger points but I don’t think there’s any amount of commercials you could run that would stop her from being confirmed.” It is a pragmatic view shared by John Cornyn, a Republican member of the Senate judiciary committee, who is due to meet Jackson on 10 March and does not expect surprises. He told reporters: “She’s not new to us. Given the fact that she’s not going to change the ideological balance on the court … we all have a pretty good idea what the outcome is likely to be.”",News/US news,This time McConnell holds few cards to stop Biden’s supreme court pick,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/05/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-republicans-mitch-mcconnell
3/5/2022,"A decades-long ban on bear hunting in parts of North Carolina has been overturned by the state’s wildlife resources commission, in a move that has sparked outcry from local residents and American animal rights groups. The North Carolina commission voted to allow bear hunting in three bear sanctuaries, encompassing an area of 92,500 acres of mountainous forest in the southern US state. The sanctuaries, established to protect and preserve North Carolina’s black bear population, are set to open to hunters later in 2022, despite thousands of people signing a petition against the move. Bear hunting has been banned in North Carolina’s Panthertown-Bonas Defeat, Standing Indian and Pisgah Bear sanctuaries since 1971. The number of black bears in the state has since grown from fewer than 1,000 to about 25,000, according to the wildlife commission. In a January public hearing, the commission said the US Forest Service, the federal agency that oversees America’s 154 national forests, had requested that hunting be allowed in the three sanctuaries “due to increased human-bear interactions”. The commission voted in favor of the proposal in late February, in defiance of opponents who say hunting will not reduce human-bear encounters. “It will definitely not target the actual bears involved in the original complaint of ‘increased bear-human interactions’,” said Bill Lea, a North Carolina-based nature photographer and retired US Forest Service assistant district ranger. “Instead, the plan will target many of the younger bears who have just started life on their own away from their mothers and who have not yet developed the skills to elude the packs of vicious dogs and hunters. The indiscriminate killing of bears never addresses the problem of individual bear behavior.” The American black bear is native to North America, where it can be found across Canada and in much of the western and eastern US, including North Carolina, California and New York. The bears, which can weigh up to 660lb (300kg), are omnivores who are normally wary of humans, but can develop a taste for food designed for humans if it is left easily accessible. A petition, addressed to the wildlife commission and signed by almost 8,000 people, said it was mostly humans who are to blame for bear encounters. “We as humans need to address and acknowledge that our actions are changing bear behavior and causing conflicts. Managing our habits, understanding how they impact bears, and adjusting our activities will solve bear-human conflicts, not hunting,” the petition said. Friends of Panthertown, a non-profit group which protects and maintains parts of the Panthertown-Bonas Defeat bear sanctuary, said 2,744 people had commented on the North Carolina commission’s bear hunting proposal, with 86% of people opposed to the changes. “Bear hunting has no place in Panthertown,” said Jason Kimenker, executive director of Friends of Panthertown. “This is their natural, wild habitat. These forests are their territory. This is their home. We are the visitors here and we all have a responsibility to continue to protect the bears.” Friends of Panthertown said human-bear interactions had dropped after it installed “bear-proof food storage vaults”. Local groups say they will continue to lobby against bear hunting, but as it stands hunters will be allowed access to the three huge sanctuaries this fall. “I don’t think we would be fully human if we did not feel compassion for bears and other animals as individuals,” Brad Stanback, one of the members of the North Carolina wildlife resources commission, told the Asheville Citizen Times. The commission did not respond to a request for comment. Peta was among the national organizations to criticize the move. “Peta reminds the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission that bears are not living targets for gun nuts, that they can manage their own populations based on available resources, and that there are always humane solutions for dealing with real or perceived conflicts with wildlife,” the group said in a statement. Animal protection groups said proper storage of food and scented items was the way to reduce encounters, along with better education about how hikers and visitors can prevent visits from curious bears. “North Carolina cannot hunt its way out of human-bear conflicts as an excuse for a trophy,” Kitty Block, president and chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States, said. “Black bears are slow to reproduce and susceptible to overkill from both legal hunting and poaching. They provide vast benefits to their ecosystems, and destroying them instead of implementing proper solutions, is a disaster. “If black bears are to survive and thrive, we must learn to adapt and share our world with them.”",News/US news,Outcry as North Carolina overturns bear-hunting ban,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/05/north-carolina-bear-hunting-activists-dismay
3/5/2022,"It wasn’t navigating rocky paths, herding hundreds of animals or the prospect of spending 14 nights in a tent that Emily Garthwaite was thinking about on her first day on the Zagros mountain range. It was where she fitted within Hossein and Jahan’s family. The British-born photojournalist, who has lived in northern Iraq since 2019, was joining the husband and wife, three of their nine children, other relatives, plus donkeys, dogs, sheep, goats and horses, for their biannual Kuch (migration). The nomad family of the Bakhtiari tribe were moving to warmer pastures for the winter months of 2020, a 250km walk. “The hardest part of the initial stages was working out how I could keep a respectful distance and still help out. Staying on the sidelines often makes people more uncomfortable.” Putting up tents, clearing away bread after meals and keeping an eye on the livestock took her focus; Garthwaite didn’t even pick up her camera for the first couple of days. This photograph was taken towards the end, under the midday sun. “I was quite weak, as the day before I’d dinged a rib falling on a rock, and we’d eaten a lot of fat from one of the sheep that had died. My body wasn’t used to it, so I was sick. Heavily boiled mint leaves, piles of sugar and black tea helped. It was a hard day, but not a bad day. I took the photo on my iPhone XR, but I wish I’d taken it on my Leica SL2, as then it could have been printed bigger.” Garthwaite bonded deeply with the family, often walking for hours in the company of Hossein, who she says “brought her in like a daughter”. Just as she invested weeks, and not a few days, in getting to know the family, she has no plans to leave the region anytime soon. “If you want to learn about a country, you can’t just fly in and out. Until you have photographed the same mountainside, olive grove or pomegranate farm in winter, spring, summer and autumn, you can’t truly say you know it,” she says.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘The nomads brought me in like a daughter’: Emily Garthwaite’s best phone picture,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/05/emily-garthwaites-best-phone-picture-nomads
3/5/2022,"Rachael Haynes barely got a look in last time a 50-over Women’s World Cup was played, back in 2017: she was selected for just two of the matches – both times only because Meg Lanning was sitting out with a shoulder injury. One match into Australia’s 2022 campaign and how the tables have turned. On Saturday it was Haynes who led the charge, hitting her maiden World Cup century as she took Australia to a 12-run victory in their opening encounter of the tournament against England. Lanning, meanwhile, joined her for a record-breaking second-wicket stand of 196 (the highest ever partnership against England in an ODI), but was generally content to play second fiddle, falling 14 runs short of a century of her own. It was a day for breaking records. By the time Haynes was dismissed in the penultimate over, holing out to deep midwicket, she had 130 runs to her name – the highest individual score ever made against England in a World Cup. A mini-onslaught from Ellyse Perry (14 not out from five balls), who smashed three boundaries from Sophie Ecclestone’s final over, then took Australia to a total of 310 for three – the highest ever against England in a World Cup. Unassailable? Only just, as it transpired. At 232 for six in the 42nd over, England looked down and out; but where Katherine Brunt is concerned, you should never count them out. Joining fiancée Sciver at the crease, the pair proceeded to smash 64 from 45 balls, taking England within touching distance of victory. Only a stunning one-handed grab from Jess Jonassen, tasked with defending 15 from the last over, could do for Brunt. Sciver, who had brought up a brilliant 79-ball hundred in the 48th over with a sneaky little paddle through fine leg, finished unbeaten on 109, as Australia’s convincing win turned into a nail-biter. Only one match in for the defending champions and it is pretty clear that this World Cup is going to be one wild ride. “In tournament play it’s good to have those tight contests and be pushed – England certainly did that today,” Haynes said. “To walk away with the win is a really positive start to our campaign.” Sciver, too, was keen to take the positives. “It feels frustrating [not to get the win] but also really encouraging,” she said. “From where we were at the end of the Ashes, to be able to turn that around in a couple of weeks is really important. We’ve already seen some high-scoring games in the tournament and it’s important for us to do the same.” England’s run chase had started limply before Sciver’s hundred showed the way to brighter things. The usual suspects did their thing: Lauren Winfield-Hill bagged a four-ball duck, while Amy Jones holed out to midwicket in single figures. In between times, Heather Knight (40) showed intent, striding down the pitch to slam Jonassen’s first ball over long-off for six, while Tammy Beaumont (74) became the fastest woman to reach 3,000 ODI runs. Fittingly, on a day when the cricket world was united in mourning for the untimely death of Shane Warne, it was leg-spinner Alana King (three for 59) who further dented England’s hopes, doing for Sophia Dunkley just when her sixth-wicket partnership with Sciver looked to be gaining momentum. After ripping the ball past Beaumont’s outside edge and having her stumped, King tapped her black armband to acknowledge the debt. Earlier, having been put in to bat by Knight, Australia’s innings had begun with necessary grafting from Lanning and Haynes. “I found it really tricky early, it was slow coming through and England got a bit of swing early,” Haynes said. “They were really disciplined with their lines, it was tough to get going.” It was not until both players had secured their half-centuries in the 31st over that they felt able to accelerate. The fact that the innings ended with a bang, with Haynes and Beth Mooney (27 not out off 19) scoring 59 runs from the final five overs, turned out to be Australia’s salvation.",Sport/Sport,Australia hold off England at Cricket World Cup on a day for records,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/05/australia-hold-off-england-at-cricket-world-cup-on-a-day-for-records
