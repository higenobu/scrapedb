4/13/2022,"By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett needed just two weeks to put together Berkshire Hathaway Inc's $11.6 billion takeover of Alleghany Corp, its largest acquisition in six years, even as he balked at paying the insurer's banking fee, a regulatory filing on Monday shows. Alleghany said its Chief Executive Officer Joseph Brandon met with Buffett for dinner in New York City on March 7, where after some ""casual conversation"" Buffett offered $850 per share in cash for the company, less the fee for bankers at Goldman Sachs. Five days later, Brandon and Alleghany Chairman Jefferson Kirby met Buffett in Omaha, Nebraska, where Kirby asked Buffett to make a higher offer, pay Goldman's $27 million fee, or use Berkshire stock to fund part of the purchase. ""Mr. Buffett reiterated the terms of his original offer, indicating firmly he did not intend to change his position on those points,"" the filing said. Berkshire, which is based in Omaha, ultimately agreed to pay $848.02 per share, with the $1.98 difference from $850 accounting for Goldman's fee. The merger was announced on March 21. Alleghany got 25 days to potentially find a better offer. Goldman has since asked 31 potential bidders about their interest, the filing said. The ""go-shop"" period ends on April 14. Brandon led Berkshire's General Re unit from 2001 to 2008. Buffett, 91, has long objected to the costs of doing business on Wall Street. He rarely uses investment banks at Berkshire, relying on 98-year-old Vice Chairman Charlie Munger for help in major capital decisions. Buffett has praised former Goldman banker Byron Trott, working with him on purchases of food distributor McLane Co from Walmart Inc and a large stake in truck stop operator Pilot Flying J from the family of billionaire Jimmy Haslam. The Alleghany purchase is expected to close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory and Alleghany shareholder approvals. Berkshire's last major acquisition was the $32.1 billion purchase of aircraft and industrial parts maker Precision Castparts in 2016.

4/13/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Jeff Bezos went on 60 Minutes in 2013 and pledged to fill the skies with a fleet of delivery drones that could zip parcels to customers’ homes in 30 minutes. Asked when this future would arrive, the Amazon.com Inc. founder said he expected drone deliveries to commence in the next five years or thereabouts. Most Read from Bloomberg U.S. Pullout of Locked-Down Shanghai Deepens China Tensions Multiple People Shot at Brooklyn’s 36th Street Subway Station Ukraine Update: U.S. Warns India Over Russian Energy Imports Europe Moves to Arm Ukraine as Sanctions Fail to Sway Putin U.S. Inflation Quickens to 8.5%, Ratcheting Up Pressure on Fed Almost a decade later, despite spending more than $2 billion and assembling a team of more than 1,000 people around the world, Amazon is a long way from launching a drone delivery service. A Bloomberg investigation based on internal documents, government reports and interviews with 13 current and former employees reveals a program beset by technical challenges, high turnover and safety concerns. A serious crash in June prompted federal regulators to question the drone’s airworthiness because multiple safety features failed and the machine careened out of control, causing a brush fire. While experimental aircraft are expected to crash during test flights, current and former employees say pressure to get the program back on track has prompted some managers to take unnecessary risks that have put personnel in harm’s way. “With rigorous testing like this, we expect these types of events to occur, and we apply the learnings from each flight towards improving safety,” Amazon spokesman Av Zammit said in an emailed statement. “No one has ever been injured or harmed as a result of these flights, and each test is done in compliance with all applicable regulations.” Amazon plans to ramp up testing in the coming months. Having missed a goal of conducting 2,500 test flights last year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg, the company has set an even loftier target of 12,000 for 2022—although fewer than 200 had been completed as of late February. The company plans to add new testing locations this year in College Station, Texas, about 100 miles northeast of Austin, and Lockeford, California, near Stockton. Amazon also hopes to start testing drones beyond the sight of flight observers, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg, a key step toward proving their ability to fly autonomously. It will be years before the Federal Aviation Administration approves commercial drone deliveries, although the agency is letting companies conduct test flights in increasingly populated areas so long as they don’t pose significant safety risks. But the prospect of replacing human drivers with flying robots appeals to online retailers because 30-minute shipping is expected to become standard for certain deliveries, such as medicine, snacks and baby products. Amazon drones could fan out up to 7 miles (11 km) from a delivery station, breezing above traffic to deliver packages weighing as much as 5 pounds (2.3 kg) within a half-hour of a customer clicking “buy.” The speed would finally make ordering from Amazon as quick as a trip to the store and help offset one of the biggest costs of e-commerce: paying someone to drive packages to homes. The Seattle-based company is under growing pressure to keep up with deep-pocketed rivals. Just last week, Alphabet Inc.’s Google Wing accelerated its own drone testing program by starting to ferry packages to shoppers from Walgreens in a 90-square-mile suburban area north of Dallas. Walmart Inc. and United Parcel Service have their own drone programs in varying stages of development. Even Amazon’s toughest internal critics don’t question the technology’s potential, but current and former employees say the company is doing what it has done so many times before: putting speed before safety in the name of beating the competition. “Someone is going to have to get killed or maimed for them to take these safety issues seriously,” said Cheddi Skeete, a former Amazon drone project manager who says he was fired last month for raising concerns to his managers. “How can we bring these tests to more communities when we know we have problems.” Spokesperson Zammit denied Skeete was terminated for speaking up. The FAA declined to comment on the crashes, but said its testing requirements were designed to protect the public. “Flight testing is a critical part of all aircraft certification projects,” the agency said. “FAA flight-testing approvals contain provisions to ensure it occurs safely, without posing a hazard to people, property or other aircraft.” In 2013, Amazon tapped aviation buff and software engineer Gur Kimchi to run its nascent drone program, now known as Prime Air. Designing delivery drones promised to be a heavy lift—and Amazon made the challenge all the harder by opting to create a completely new machine itself rather than farming out pieces of the design and building of prototypes to other companies. Kimchi favored a D.I.Y approach because doing so gave the team control over the final design, but former and current employees said the decision slowed development. For example, personnel wound copper wire around electric motor magnets themselves when an outside vendor could have done it faster. Even the prototypes were built in-house by hand. The machines Bezos revealed on 60 Minutes resembled something you might see in a local park and simply weren’t up to the task; they could barely fly a mile and got tossed around in wind gusts. Amazon wanted a drone that blended the ability of a plane to fly long distances with the maneuverability of a helicopter that can swiftly change direction to avoid trees and power lines and hover over a back yard during inclement weather. The drones also needed to fly and find their destination with no human intervention. The team went through more than two dozen concepts. The work was tedious and slow. The drones required new software that would allow on-board cameras to recognize and react to obstacles and differentiate between things like swimming pools and driveways. The team ultimately settled on a large 85-pound drone because they wanted it to be capable of carrying a 5-pound parcel—a payload that covers about 85% of the packages Amazon delivers. Extending the range as much as possible was key because every extra mile meant the drone could serve a larger population. Bezos was patient with the team so long as it meant creating a superior machine, according to a senior executive familiar with the program. With six propellers, Amazon’s drone can shift from flying up and down to flying forward, a difficult engineering feat that had already bedeviled the U.S. military’s notoriously over-budget V-22 Osprey aircraft. The drone’s wings encase the propellers, helping it fly more efficiently over long distances and providing an additional layer of protection around the spinning blades. Kimchi took safety seriously and gave his team time to fix defects rather than rushing them, according to people who worked for him. Information was shared freely, and employees were allowed to watch video of crashes to assess what went wrong. “The Prime Air group had a pretty strong safety culture,” said one former employee, who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters without authorization. “I remember even just the software meetings, we always had to open our meetings with someone volunteering a safety tip. They definitely weren’t playing fast and loose.” Yet as the team struggled to get the drone’s various components working seamlessly together, one deadline after another came and went, according to a former employee. Jeff Wilke, who then ran Amazon’s consumer division, wanted to demonstrate the drone at a 2019 tech conference and announce that deliveries would begin by the end of that year. During a meeting with the drone team, he shared the goal to make sure everyone was on the same page. Employees knew the timing was unrealistic but dared not challenge him, according to people who were there. Wilke showed off the drone at a Las Vegas hotel, playing video of it operating and touting the potential upsides for customers. He didn’t provide a date for the start of deliveries, saying they’d begin in “months.” Several employees watching the presentation recall thinking Kimchi wouldn’t be around much longer. The following year, the drone program became part of Amazon’s operations team, another sign executives wanted to move things along, and Kimchi was out as the boss. He left Amazon later that year. “He overpromised and underdelivered,” said one former employee, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal matter. “That said, I think if the guy wasn’t so positive, or overambitious about the timelines, I don’t know if Prime Air would exist.” Kimchi declined to comment. In March 2020, Amazon hired David Carbon to run the drone program. The Boeing Co. veteran arrived with baggage. A New York Times investigation had previously revealed that a Boeing 787 factory that Carbon ran in South Carolina tended to value production over safety. Several employees told the newspaper they’d been retaliated against for raising safety concerns. Though the problems pre-dated Carbon’s arrival, they continued on his watch, the Times reported. Boeing executives defended the plant’s commitment to safety, but a month later Carbon was on his way out. When Amazon announced his hiring internally the following year, an interim director of the drone program told the team not to believe everything they read in the press, according to current and former employees. That didn’t stop them from googling Carbon on their smartphones during the meeting. Still, these people acknowledge that Carbon brought discipline and focus to the program. His long industry experience helped accelerate development and he began farming out some drone production. He closed facilities in England and France and moved some image-recognition work to lower-cost Costa Rica. But current and former employees said it wasn’t long before Carbon began pushing speed over safety. Amazon didn’t make the drone chief available for an interview, but spokesperson Zammit said Carbon “has over 25 years of experience bringing aerospace innovations to scale safely and reliably, and we’re excited that he’s leading the next phase of our mission to bring 30-minute delivery by drones to customers.” Last year, an Amazon team was preparing for a flight at a Crows Landing testing facility in California’s Central Valley about 20 miles south of Modesto. Some of the crew worried they would violate FAA testing guidelines because a farmer was driving a tractor in the flight path. After a debate, according to personnel who were there, a team leader said the test would be safe so long as the drone wasn’t directly above the farmer. They conducted the test without incident, but some employees said the boss had improperly interpreted the FAA rules. “We always clear the test area before beginning each flight test,” Zammit said in the emailed statement. “In this instance, a farm vehicle entered the field after we launched. The crew safely and quickly landed the drone.” David Johnson was a drone flight assistant for about a year, mostly at remote testing facilities in rural Oregon. He said Amazon often conducted tests without a full flight team and inadequate equipment, forcing employees to handle more than one role. For example, he said, someone responsible for a pre-flight drone inspection would quickly pivot to flight observer, which requires watching out for potential obstacles. Johnson said he once warned his bosses that his laptop had a broken keyboard but wasn’t given a replacement in time for a test. He went ahead with an external keyboard that made it difficult to complete a pre-flight inspection in time. Johnson said he was still completing his checklist when the drone took off, earning him a reprimand for taking his eyes off the aircraft. “They give people multiple things to do in a very narrow window of time to try to boost their numbers, and people cut corners,” Johnson said. “They were more concerned about pumping flights out and didn’t want to slow down.” Two former Amazon employees corroborated Johnson’s account that crew members have been assigned multiple roles to keep tests going if the full team isn’t present. Amazon’s Zammit called those claims false. “Crew members are assigned to only one role per flight,” he said. “Before each flight test, crew members are briefed on their individual role. We do not set time limits for completion of any aspect of our flight tests, and our team can take their time to complete their roles safely.” While information flowed freely during the Kimchi era, Carbon put a stop to that, according to current and former employees. They said he was sensitive about language in written documents due to potential liability or regulatory scrutiny and let only select people view video of crashes, a move some employees interpreted as fear that clips would be leaked to the media. During a meeting, according to several people who were there, one employee suggested safety concerns were being “swept under the rug.” Carbon bristled, these people said, and cautioned the employee to be more careful with his choice of words. They said Carbon’s reaction had a chilling effect, discouraging others from speaking out. “The people most worried about safety were the ones conducting flights in hazardous situations and the ones least concerned about safety were the ones sitting behind a desk somewhere,” said one former employee, who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters without authorization. Over a four-month period last year there were five crashes at a testing site in Pendleton, Oregon, a remote agricultural area in the high desert known for its annual rodeo and whiskey festival. Accidents are inevitable in an aviation testing program, where equipment is deliberately pushed to the max to determine breaking points and improve the vehicle’s design. But these were vehicles Amazon was hoping to deploy for public tests. In May, a drone propeller dislodged, causing the vehicle to tumble and crash upside down while its other motors were still running. The machine sustained substantial damage. Amazon employees cleared the wreckage before notifying federal officials so no inspection was conducted. The FAA advised the company not to disrupt crash sites in the future, federal records show. In June, a drone motor conked out while the vehicle was transitioning from a vertical climb to forward motion. The automatic safety feature designed to land the machine in such instances didn’t work. The aircraft flipped upside down, and a stabilizing safety function also failed. “Instead of a controlled descent to a safe landing, [the drone] dropped about 160 feet in an uncontrolled vertical fall and was consumed by fire,” the FAA wrote in a report on the incident. The ensuing blaze scorched 25 acres and was extinguished by the local fire department. Insider previously reported some of the incident’s details and last week published a report on the high costs of Amazon drone delivery. Antoine Deux, who was a senior engineer on the drone program for four years before leaving in 2018, said that after all the years and money invested, he would have thought Amazon would be farther along. Deux also said the company’s drone is too heavy compared with Google’s aircraft, which weighs about 11 pounds. “Every time you increase the weight of the load, the drone gets heavier, needs more batteries,” he said. “It’s a vicious circle.” With crashes proliferating, morale on the team worsened and employees began departing. Some took jobs at Amazon Web Services while others left the company altogether. Some who had trouble meeting the pace their managers demanded were offered severance packages. Departures in 2021, Carbon’s first full year running the department, exceeded 200 people, more than double the previous year, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. Cheddi Skeete had a front-row seat on the department’s turmoil. A former flight attendant, he started as a drone flight assistant and was put in charge of improving morale. Skeete traveled frequently to get to know workers on the front lines and identify problems. In Corvallis, Oregon, he discovered there were no portable toilets on a testing range leased from a local farmer. Female employees had to radio the entire team when they needed a bathroom break, forcing testing to be suspended while they searched for facilities off-site. Skeete said he reported the situation but was told the property owner didn’t want portable toilets on his land. The testing continued, and Skeete said he continued to question the wisdom of assigning people to a job with no restrooms. Amazon said it later installed portable toilets at the testing range. In another instance, Skeete spoke up about plans to keep testing drones just five days after a motor failed and a drone crashed. Those eager to continue tests assured the team they had checked roughly 180 motors on some 30 other drones, Skeete said. But he doubted this because testing each engine is time consuming. Amazon disputed the number of motors requiring checks. Shortly afterward, Skeete told his boss he no longer wanted to work for him. Skeete was advised to seek a different role at Amazon and said he applied for more than 30 positions. After his replacement was hired, Skeete spent weeks on the payroll with nothing to do. He filed an internal ethics complaint laying out his safety concerns but was told no such issues had turned up. Last month Skeete was fired and offered what he deemed a small severance package in exchange for signing a nondisclosure agreement. “I didn’t sign it because I’m someone who speaks up for myself and others,” Skeete said. “So many people before and after me have not been willing to speak up.” —With Alan Levin and Benoit Berthelot Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Five Million Men Are Still Missing From the U.S. Workforce SPAC Trades May Have Made as Much as 888% Profit—Now, Some Are Drawing SEC Scrutiny Building a Future for the Disabled, One Cup of Coffee at a Time The 15-Minute Ultrafast Delivery Craze Slams Into Reality Why Commercial Landlords Will Give You Months of Free Office Rent ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•2 days ago,Amazon Drone Crashes Hit Jeff Bezos' Delivery Dreams,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-drone-crashes-hit-jeff-210004766.html
4/13/2022,"The one good thing about a market downturn? You get lots of opportunities to load up on shares at a discount entry point. And who doesn’t like a discount? With the way the markets have performed so far this year, there are stocks in every segment which could potentially offer plenty of rewards. CNBC’s Jim Cramer thinks there are several names in the retail sector which look particularly enticing right now, ones for which the term “beaten-down” readily applies. Some rallied nicely toward the end of last week, but following the severe market-wide pullback, Cramer notes that it will take “many more days” before multiple names approach “being expensive again.” Taking a look at Cramer’s choices, we ran through the TipRanks database three stocks the Mad Money host thinks will make good additions to investors’ portfolios. This way we can gauge whether Wall Street’s cadre of experts agree with his selections. Let’s take a look at the results. Bath & Body Works (BBWI) Lots of stocks might be on sale right now but the same cannot be said of household goods. Prices are on the up, and macroeconomic worries around consumer spending amid rising inflation have investors feeling shaky in 2022. Shares of Bath & Body Works have suffered from this development and are down by 41% from the peak notched in November. The company is the U.S.’s biggest specialty home fragrance & fragrant body care business, boasting more than 2,000 U.S. and international stores, a meaningful online presence and serving north of 50 million consumers. Last August, the company rebranded from L Brands to its current moniker and spun off its Victoria’s Secret business. Now, its three main revenue generating segments - home fragrance, body care & fragrances and soaps & sanitizers – helped the company deliver revenue of $7.882 billion in 2021 (for the period ending on Jan 31). At the same time, the company raked in record sales in 4Q21, dialing in a set of results which beat Street expectations. Revenue increased by 11.4% year-over-year to reach $3.03 billion, just beating the Street’s $2.96 billion estimate. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.30 also beat Wall Street’s forecast - by $0.03. However, the company’s forecast called for modest earnings declines for Q1 and for the full-year 2022, developments investors did not like, while CEO Andrew Meslow’s departure on health reasons further clouded the outlook. That said, BMO’s Simeon Siegel agrees with Cramer’s assessment that the stock is ripe for the picking at present. The analyst writes: “We believe the challenging environment, a broad lack of investor appetite and expectations of this conservative guide have created extremely compelling long-term entry points and we suggest buying the recent weakness as we see upside to the reset numbers and long-term multiple re-rating.” To this end, Siegel rates BBWI shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), backed by an $83 price target. This makes room for one-year growth of ~80%. (To watch Siegel’s track record, click here) Judging by the consensus breakdown, other analysts are in agreement. 12 Buys and 2 Holds add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. In addition, the $78.93 average price target brings the upside potential to 71%. (See BBWI stock forecast on TipRanks) Signet Jewelers (SIG) For the next Cramer pick, let’s shift gears and move from fragrance to jewelry. Signet is nothing less than the largest diamond jewelry retailer in the world. Operating mostly in the middle market jewelry segment, the company also boasts leading market positions in Canada and the UK specialty jewelry sectors, while also claiming top spot in the mid-tier U.S. jewelry and watch market. This is a sizeable market worth over $90 billion of which Signet claims ~6% share and has set its sights on growing to ~10% over the next few years. Once again, we are talking of a stock that has shed plenty of its value recently. Shares are down by 34% since November’s high as the same set of worries that has plagued others has driven the share price lower – inflation’s impact on discretionary spending and the prospect of a recession. Plus, Signet has already said it will no longer purchase gems from Russia - the world’s largest source of gems. These are things to be concerned about but going by the company’s latest set of quarterly results and outlook, Signet appears to be coping just fine. Non-GAAP EPS of $5.01 hit Street targets and revenue increased by 28.3% year-over-year to reach $2.81 billion, in turn beating the analysts’ $2.41 billion forecast. Even more promisingly, in today’s difficult environment, for 1Q23, the company expects total revenue to come in between $1.78 billion to $1.82 billion. Consensus had that figure at $1.74 billion. That is an impressive feat, says Wells Fargo’s Ike Boruchow, who backs Cramer’s take too. “With QTD remaining very strong (during a key selling period, Valentine's Day) we believe it shows that a weakening low-end consumer doesn't take the SIG bull case off the rails,” the analyst said. “In fact, SIG may be the first company in our space to guide 1Q numbers up. With a war chest of cash on the balance sheet and fundamental momentum, we view the story as one of the best in the space today and SIG remains a 'Top Pick' for us.” Bearing this in mind, Boruchow rates SIG an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $105 price target. Should this target be met, a twelve-month gain of ~50% could be in the cards. (To watch Boruchow's track record, click here) Looking at the consensus breakdown, analysts are split right down the middle when it comes to SIG. 2 Buys and 2 Sells add up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Additionally, the $109.25 average price target implies ~56% upside from current levels. (See SIG stock forecast on TipRanks) Macy’s (M) Smelling fragrant and looking sparkly, it’s time to head out to the department store, to fabled U.S. institution Macy’s. While the company cannot claim anymore to own the world’s largest department store, its flagship New York City spot is still the U.S’s biggest, boasting retail space of 1.25 million square feet. That store is just one of 725 department stores spread out across the U.S. which includes the Macy's, Macy's Backstage, Market by Macy's, Bloomingdale's, and bluemercury brands. Macy’s also has an international presence, with licensed stores in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, and Al Zahra, Kuwait. Department stores suffered badly during the height of the pandemic lock down period of 2020 but staged a big comeback last year. Macy’s fortunes aligned with the overall trend, and the improvement was evident in the company’ latest quarterly financial statement for 4Q21. Revenue increased by ~28% from the same period last year to clock in at $8.67 billion coming in ahead of the Street’s call of $8.45 billion. There was a fine beat on the bottom-line as adj. EPS of $2.45 beat the $1.99 consensus estimate. There was more good news on the outlook. Macy’s guided for 2022 revenue and EPS of $24.46-$24.70 billion and $4.13-$4.52, respectively, which at the mid-point came in 2% and 7% above Street expectations, respectively. So, with shares having adhered to the trend, and down by 36% since November’s yearly high, you can see why Cramer thinks it is time to load up. However, Morgan Stanley’s Kimberly Greenberger begs to differ, and explains why she holds a bearish view on Macy’s prospects. “At first blush the guidance suggests M's performance could be relatively stable against last year's strong consumer environment with 2022 revenue flat to up 1% y/y. However, management's outlook implies outsized 1Q y/y revenue growth followed by revenue declines y/y in 2Q-4Q as the business laps peak consumer demand,” Greenberger explained. “M's best financial performance may be in the rear-view mirror. As such, we remain cautious on L-T revenue & earnings growth potential.” Accordingly, Greenberger rates Macy an Underweight (i.e. Sell) and her $20 price target suggests shares will drift 16% lower over the coming months. (To watch Greenberger’s track record, click here) The Street’s outlook for M stock is a little confusing; on the one hand, based on 4 Holds and 3 Buys and Sells, each, the stock makes do with a Hold consensus rating. However, the average target is resolutely positive; at $31.22, the figure implies gains of 31% could be in store over the one-year timeframe.

Here’s What Analysts Think,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-jim-cramer-stock-picks-011527428.html
4/13/2022,"(Reuters) -Russia will take legal action if the West tries to force it to default on its sovereign debt, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told the pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper on Monday, sharpening Moscow's tone in its financial wrestle with the West. Russia faces its first external sovereign default in more than a century after it made arrangements to make an international bond repayment in roubles last week, even though the payment was due in U.S. dollars. It had been due on April 4 to make a payment of $649 million to holders of two of its sovereign bonds, but the U.S. Treasury blocked the transfer, preventing Russia from using any of its frozen foreign currency reserves to service its debt. ""Of course we will sue, because we have taken all the necessary steps to ensure that investors receive their payments,"" Siluanov told the newspaper in an interview. ""We will present in court our bills confirming our efforts to pay both in foreign currency and in roubles. It will not be an easy process. We will have to very actively prove our case, despite all the difficulties."" Siluanov did not elaborate on Russia's legal options and did not say where any court hearing could happen. The bonds in question were issued under English law, which allows a borrower to defend itself by saying that an external force made it impossible to honour obligations, so the court may postpone the payment, said Mitu Gulati, professor of law at the University of Virginia. ""So I think Russia is going to argue this but ... this is a war ... caused by Russia,"" said Gulati, also an expert on debt restructuring, adding: ""This is not a completely implausible legal argument."" DELIBERATE POLICY Siluanov has said Russia will do everything possible to make sure its creditors are paid. ""Russia tried in good faith to pay off external creditors,"" Siluanov was quoted saying. ""Nevertheless, the deliberate policy of Western countries is to artificially create a man-made default by all means."" Siluanov said Russia's external liabilities amount to about 20% of the total public debt, which stood at about 21 trillion roubles ($262 billion). Of that, about 4.5-4.7 trillion roubles were external liabilities. The finance ministry did not reply to a Reuters for a comment on what specific legal actions Russia may take. Russia has not defaulted on its external debt since the aftermath of its 1917 revolution, but its bonds have now emerged as a flashpoint in its economic tussle with Western countries. The key question is whether Russian assets previously frozen by Western countries, such as nearly a half of Russia's $640 billion in gold and foreign exchange reserves, could be claimed by creditors following the default, said Artur Starikov, a partner with Capital Law Office. A default was unimaginable until recently, with Russia rated as investment grade in the run-up to its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"".
