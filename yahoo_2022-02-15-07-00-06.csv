2/15/2022,"Levi’s brand president Jennifer Sey has quit, and she says it’s because the denim company tried to silence her after she publicly spoke out against school closures during the COVID pandemic. “More than 20 years ago, I joined Levi’s. I quit so I could be free,” Sey tweeted, linking to her essay published on Bari Weiss’s Substack newsletter. In the essay, she detailed her experience working at Levi’s. After the COVID pandemic shut down schools, Sey became an outspoken advocate for keeping them open. She has four children. She claims that Levi’s management urged her to stop speaking out on political issues, but she continued to do so. After she appeared on Fox News, she got questions from the team during a company town hall meeting. Sey says she was told she could be the next CEO of Levi’s if she stopped publicly speaking out against school closures. “Every day, a dossier of my tweets and all of my online interactions were sent to the CEO by the head of corporate communications,” she writes. “At one meeting of the executive leadership team, the CEO made an offhand remark that I was ‘acting like Donald Trump.’ I felt embarrassed and turned my camera off to collect myself.” Sey says she was eventually told she didn’t have a long-term future with Levi’s and walked away from the company’s offer of a $1 million severance package because she would have had to sign a nondisclosure agreement. Levi’s did not immediately return Fortune’s request for comment. Sey, a former Olympic gymnast who competed in Moscow, says she began her career at Levi’s in 1999, starting as an assistant marketing manager and working her way up the ranks before becoming the first woman brand president. The decision about whether or not to keep schools open weighed heavily on educators and politicians during the pandemic. Many teachers unions have spoken out against keeping schools open, citing the dangers to students and teachers. But some prominent economists have spoken out against school closures, saying they do little to stop the spread of COVID while hurting children’s education.

2/15/2022,"The Trump Organization’s trusted outside accounting firm has taken the unprecedented step of ditching its client, explaining that the former president’s family company has a decade of financial statements that can’t be trusted. The bombshell move by Mazars USA—the accounting firm that has long worked with former President Donald Trump’s family and friends—was revealed in court filings in New York on Monday. The decision to drop Trump follows last month’s aggressive move by New York Attorney General Letitia James to publicly file documents detailing accounts of what it called “significant evidence” of financial fraud. The AG’s office is in the midst of two similar investigations of the Trump empire: A civil lawsuit exploring potential bank fraud by the company, and a joint criminal probe with the Manhattan District Attorney into alleged tax dodging and financial fraud. Judge Forces Top Trump Org Lieutenants to Turn Over Key Documents While the criminal case is proceeding quietly before a grand jury in New York City, Monday’s revelations stem from the AG’s civil lawsuit, which seeks to force Trump and two of his adult children to testify about business dealings. In a letter to the Trump Organization on Feb. 9, the U.S. branch of the global accounting firm Mazars told the company that “the statements of financial condition for Donald J. Trump” ranging between 2011 and 2020 “should no longer be relied upon and you should inform any recipients thereof… that those documents should not be relied upon.” The firm explained that the decision was made in light of the AG’s revelations as well as “our own investigation.” The letter goes on to sever all future business ties. “We have also reached the point such that there is a non-waivable conflict of interest with the Trump Organization,” Mazars wrote. “As a result, we are not able to provide any new work product to the Trump Organization.” The AG’s office, which got a hold of the letter, filed it in court to bolster its case that Trump, Ivanka Trump, and Don Jr. should be forced to testify about how so many family real estate development projects and properties had wildly fluctuating values that seemed high whenever they needed loans but low whenever it came time to pay taxes. Trump Organization Indictment May Spell Trouble for Trump Spawn The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The letter also alluded to another matter that criminal investigators reviewed with the Manhattan DA's office: A Trump building apartment in New York City that was provided to Matt Calamari Jr.—a family insider who is now the corporate director of security. Junior, the son of Trump Organization COO Matthew Calamari Sr., received immunity from a criminal prosecution when he testified before the grand jury investigating company benefits—such as corporate apartments—that may have run afoul of taxing laws, according to a source with direct knowledge of his testimony. In the firm's Feb. 9 letter, Mazars general counsel William J. Kelly described how accountants had not yet been able to finish preparing the tax paperwork for the former president and first lady, Melania, because they hadn't answered questions about Calamari Jr.'s fringe benefits. ""We believe the only information left to complete those returns is the information regarding the Matt Calimari Jr. apartment. As you know, Donald Bender has been asking for this information for several months but has not received it,"" Kelly wrote. Donald Bender, a partner at Mazars, has served as the trusted accountant for Trump and his lieutenants for years, a role that has since drawn scrutiny from law enforcement, according to sources with firsthand knowledge of the transactions and current investigations. Mazars has found itself in the spotlight since at least 2016, when Trump successfully ran for president but broke with tradition and refused to disclose his tax returns. The firm successfully protected Trump’s tax returns from seeing the light of day, receiving widespread rebuke in the process. And the precedent-establishing Supreme Court fight that ultimately handed those tax documents to the Manhattan DA—but not Congress—bears the firm’s name. Read more at The Daily Beast.

2/15/2022,"A federal judge on Monday said that he will toss a lawsuit alleging the New York Times and its former top editor defamed Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in a 2017 editorial. Even as jurors continue to deliberate the case—which observers feared might be a significant blow against press freedom—U.S. District Court Judge Jed Rakoff announced that he would dismiss the lawsuit filed against the paper and its former editorial page editor James Bennet, who resigned in June 2020 amid internal backlash to another column. The lawsuit alleges that the Grey Lady intentionally tried to harm Palin in a 2017 piece entitled “America’s Lethal Politics.” “My job is to apply the law,” Rakoff said on Monday. “The law sets a very high standard for actual malice and in this case, the Court finds that standard has not been met.” Since Palin is a public figure, Rakoff noted, the threshold to meet the burden of malice is significantly higher—and the former governor’s team did not successfully prove the standard. Rakoff said he would allow the jury to reach a verdict, as his decision will likely be appealed and the jury’s decision will help inform the appeals court. Despite his ruling, Rakoff was critical of the Times for the column, signed by the newspaper's editorial board, that erroneously linked Palin’s political action committee and its rhetoric to the 2011 Arizona mass shooting that killed six people and severely injured then-Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. “This is an example of very unfortunate editorializing on the part of the Times,” the judge said, adding that he was “not at all happy to make this decision” and rule in the newspaper’s favor. The dismissal does not exactly come as a shock—especially since Rakoff made a similar motion back in 2019 that was ultimately reversed by an appellant court. Even Palin attorney Shane Vogt admitted during opening statements last week that the suit was unlikely to succeed, thanks to decades-old protections for journalists offered in part by a precedent involving the Times: the 1964 New York Times v. Sullivan ruling that established the standard for defaming public figures. Roy Gutterman, a Syracuse University professor and director of the school’s Tully Center for Free Speech, believes Rakoff’s impending dismissal “makes a lot of sense, even if the jury was still deliberating at the same time.” “Because the plaintiff here is a high profile public official and figure, proving that the newspaper’s errors were a lot more than an honest mistake was a high burden she could not meet, ” Gutterman said in a statement to The Daily Beast. “This is the type of case that shows exactly why we have the actual malice standard under the First Amendment. Public officials have to overcome a high burden for a reason.” “An editing mistake, though ‘unfortunate,’ as the judge noted, is not proof of actual malice. This case will likely live on through appeals,” he added. Sarah Palin Lives Out Right-Wing News Media Fantasy in Court Jurors, however, still have decide whether they believe Bennet and the Times acted with “actual malice” when they used the disputed wording in the editorial, meaning that the former editor knew what he had written in the piece was false or that he published the piece with “reckless disregard” for the truth. Palin’s lawyers argued Times editorial staff actively chose not to fact check the column’s claims and deliberately fed a narrative they knew to be false about the Republican. Despite the uphill battle, Palin lawyer Kenneth Turkel insisted to jurors during closing arguments on Friday that the Times was “keen on turning a blind eye” to the truth and did not seem to care about whether their editorial harmed the former Republican governor. Turkel also argued the Times has a history of slamming conservative politicians and did not care about defaming Palin because “she’s one of them.” “All they had to do was care a little bit. All they had to do was dislike my client a little less,” Turkel said. Lawyers for the Times, however, argued that Bennet and the newspaper made an “honest mistake” in erroneously connecting Palin’s PAC to the 2011 shooting. The piece in question was published on June 14, 2017, just hours after Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise was wounded by a man who opened fire on a congressional baseball practice in Washington. The shooter was later identified as a vehement supporter of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. “That's all this was,” lawyer David Axelrod said during closing arguments on Friday. He conceded that no link was ever found between Palin’s map and Jared Lee Loughner, the Arizona shooter who had mental illness and a long-running fixation on Giffords; the Times moved “very quickly” to correct their mistake, he said. It was an “honest mistake that caused James Bennet to stay up all night,” Axelrod stressed to prove that the former editor did not intentionally try to harm Palin in an editorial that was supposed to be about gun policy. The Times corrected the editorial less than 24 hours after it was published, though the mea culpa notably did not mention Palin by name nor did it remove the Republican’s name in the column itself. Axelrod went on to argue that Palin did not suffer any career harm as a result of the Times piece, since she has made a career out of paid speeches and TV appearances, including a 2020 stint on The Masked Singer. Taking the stand on Thursday, Palin stressed to jurors how “powerless” she felt when she saw the editorial and the newspaper’s ultimate decision not to remove her name from the piece. “I knew that… if I wanted to raise my head and try to get the word out, that there were untruths printed once again, I knew that I was up against Goliath…and I was David,” Palin said. A day earlier, Bennet took the stand to discuss errors in the editorial process that led to the published piece, which was originally drafted by now-reporter Elizabeth Williamson—including how he did not personally conduct any research himself. That may have contributed to the piece wrongly suggesting a map circulated by Palin’s PAC in 2010 had placed crosshairs on individual members of Congress, when in fact they were placed on congressional districts. Crucially, the original editorial said “the link to political incitement was clear” between Palin’s political activities and the shooting. “This is my fault right? I am the one who wrote those sentences,” Bennet said on Tuesday, saying that the mistake was born out of rushing to meet a deadline in a move that he has lived to regret.
