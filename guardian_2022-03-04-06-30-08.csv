3/4/2022,"There hasn’t been so much drama on Q+A since an audience member threw a shoe at then prime minister John Howard as he was talking about Australia’s involvement in the war in Iraq 12 years ago. On Thursday night a pro-Putin member of the Q+A audience was dramatically booted out of the ABC studio by the host, Stan Grant, after he asked a question that Grant said “advocated violence” against Ukrainians. The world is watching as Russian troops continue a full-scale invasion of Europe’s second largest country. If you have a question for the panel, submit it via the #QandA website now: https://t.co/BOVpYtQB0j pic.twitter.com/2wqeEm7cJw The young man, Sasha Gillies-Lekakis, had asked a “rogue” question, Grant said, that had not been vetted by producers. It prompted shouts of “lies” from the audience. “As someone who comes from the Russian community here in Australia, I’ve been pretty outraged by the narrative depicted by our media, with Ukraine as the good guy and Russia as the bad guy,” Gillies-Lekakis said. Has Western media lacked nuance in its depiction of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and ignored Russian voices who support Putin? #QandA pic.twitter.com/E4j1oIff3S “Believe it or not, there are a lot of Russians here and around the world that support what Putin’s doing in Ukraine, myself included. Since 2014, the Ukraine has besieged the Russian populations in Donetsk and Luhansk unprovoked, killing an estimated 13,000 people.” An audience member interjected with “That’s a lie” and “Don’t do this, it’s propaganda” and Grant factchecked the assertion that 13,000 Russians had been killed. “The United Nations has listed 13,000 total killed since the conflict, but you’re trying to suggest that is Russians killed by Ukrainians,” Grant said. “The United Nations has pointed out that there’s 13,000 killed since the conflict began.” But Gillies-Lekakis continued: “Where was your concern and outpouring of grief for those thousands of Russians? Do you not see the hypocrisy in your positions by ignoring the terrible violence perpetrated by the Ukraine, which to many Russians seems a perfect justification for Putin to intervene?” After a brief discussion, the program moved on to other issues including the floods in New South Wales and Queensland but a visibly unnerved Grant returned to address the young man later in the show. “Something has been bothering me, I have to admit, since we had Sasha’s question earlier about Russia, and it’s been playing on my mind,” Grant said.

You supported what’s happening, hearing that people are dying. Can I just say – I’m just not comfortable with you being here. Could you please leave?” But Gillies-Lekakis did not want to leave and protested. Grant said: “You can ask a question but we cannot advocate violence. I should have asked you to leave then. It’s been playing on my mind and, I’m sorry, but I have to ask you to leave.” The audience applauded Grant’s stance and, while Gillies-Lekakis initially resisted, he did leave while the camera stayed on Grant. Grant apologised for the disruption but said he “can’t have anyone who is sanctioning, supporting, violence and killing of people” in the studio. “It was not a vetted question. It was a question that was, you know, a rogue question, if you like. It’s not good to exclude people, but we have to take those steps from time to time.”",News/Australia news,Q+A audience member booted from studio after asking pro-Russia ‘rogue’ question,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/04/qa-audience-member-booted-from-studio-after-asking-pro-russia-question-that-advocated-violence
3/4/2022,"Hundreds of people have gathered at a vigil in Clapham Common to commemorate and pay their respects to Sarah Everard, who was abducted and murdered a year ago. A crowd walked through Clapham North to the Clapham Common bandstand, the same monument where hundreds of flowers were laid last year when Everard’s abduction and murder first came to light. Flowers were laid and candles lit at the bandstand on Thursday evening, and poetry was recited and speeches were made regarding the issue of violence against women and girls. The vigil, organised by the community group Urban Angels, ended with a minute’s silence. Talisker Alcobia Cornford, 22, founded Urban Angels in 2021, after being inspired to launch the platform following Everard’s murder. The group of women and non-binary people is made up of 13 smaller Facebook groups across the UK, with its main function to share accounts of incidents of sexual harassment, assault or events that have made members feel unsafe, with the hope of warning others about what may be happening at a specific location in their community. “What initially gave me the idea was from my personal experiences of walking home from nights out, and just being a woman in general walking streets during the day. But the [death of Everard] definitely gave me the spur to create the community straight away,” said Cornford. Everard was kidnapped, raped and killed by Wayne Couzens, then a serving police officer, on 3 March 2020. Cornford does feel there has been some change in attitudes towards violence against women since then. “We’ve been speaking to venues who are keen to have their bouncers trained properly about how to look for spiking, and have been speaking to local councils, and other incredible organisations which have come about in the last year, such as Stamp Out Spiking, Slutsafe and Homesafe.” However, Cornford believes there is still a “very long way to go”. “A significant number of women still feel unsafe walking at night,” she says. “Personally, I do not feel that safe in London especially.” Rachel Strong, 25, a sign language interpreter, was among the thousands who attended the vigil and paid her respects at the Clapham Common bandstand last year. “Something about what happened to her, being a similar age and living in a similar area to me, really impacted me,” she says. “So when I found out about the vigil today, there was no doubt in my mind that I would go.” Mark Hall, who is in his 50s, said he attended the vigil to show his respects, and that he was “shocked, dismayed and traumatised” when thinking about Everard’s murder. “I’m hoping that by lots of people coming out like this, it might mean there will be some changes, which mean it would be less likely to happen to girls and women in the future,” he said. Hall said the UK’s criminal justice system had a lot to answer for in terms of improving actions and attitudes towards violence against women and girls. “I think, given the pathetic percentages of rape allegations that are successfully prosecuted, indicates that a lot more needs to be done.” Martha Cope, a 52-year-old actor, said Everard’s murder affected her as her daily walk during lockdown last year was in almost the exact area where Everard was abducted. “I have a 22-year-old daughter and I don’t think anything has happened, since or before, to make women feel safer,” she said. “I haven’t seen any change in the past year.” In a statement released on Thursday by the Metropolitan police, Everard’s family said they had been overwhelmed by the public’s support. “It is a year since Sarah died and we remember her today, as every day, with all our love,” they said. “Our lives have changed for ever and we live with the sadness of our loss. Sarah was wonderful and we miss her all the time. Over the past year we have been overwhelmed with the kindness shown to us, not just by family and friends, but by the wider public. “Sadly, Sarah is not the only woman to have lost her life recently in violent circumstances and we would like to extend our deepest sympathy to other families who are also grieving.”",News/UK news,Crowds gather to remember Sarah Everard at Clapham Common vigil,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/03/crowds-gather-to-remember-sarah-everard-at-clapham-common-vigil
3/4/2022,"US hopes of hosting men’s and women’s Rugby World Cups in 2029 and 2031 got a boost from Capitol Hill on Thursday, with the introduction of a bipartisan congressional resolution expressing support for the bid. The resolution was introduced by the co-chairs of the Congressional Rugby Caucus, Alex Mooney, a West Virginia Republican, and Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat from Washington DC. Mooney said: “As a former college rugby player at Dartmouth College, I continue to enjoy watching the sport … as co-chairman of the Congressional Rugby Caucus, I am proud to be an advocate for the Rugby World Cup.” Holmes Norton said: “Rugby has made a difference to the youth of the District of Columbia and across the country in terms of health, self-esteem, teamwork and social skills. I am proud to support the US bids to host the men’s and women’s Rugby World Cup tournaments.” Sean Casten, an Illinois Democrat, and two Republicans, Richard Hudson from North Carolina and Paul Gosar from Arizona, also co-sponsored the measure. The US will compete at the next women’s event, in New Zealand this October, a tournament delayed by the Covid pandemic. England is World Rugby’s preferred host for the women’s tournament in 2025 while the US is in exclusive talks for 2029. The next men’s Rugby World Cup will be played in France in 2023. The US will face Chile in a two-legged qualifier this year. Australia has preferred candidate status for 2027 while the US is in “exclusive targeted dialogue” for 2031. In December, USA Rugby chief executive Ross Young told the Guardian: “We’ll either be awarded the World Cup in ’31 in May, or they’ll go back to the drawing board. They’re not going to announce anyone else.” Russia also launched a bid – before the invasion of Ukraine and the political, business and sporting pariah status it brought. The US men’s professional competition, Major League Rugby, is in its fifth season. Some around the world saw a Test between the US Eagles and New Zealand in Maryland last October – won 104-14 by the All Blacks – as a reversal for the US World Cup bid. Young disagreed. He said: “The huge attraction of a World Cup coming here is rugby really starting to unlock, or using this 10-year pathway to unlock, the biggest media market in the world. Or unlock the potential for that media market.” The US bid includes NFL and college football stadiums. On Thursday, the chair of the USA bid, Jim Brown, said: “Today’s resolution demonstrates a clear commitment to growing the game of rugby and advancing the United States’ Rugby World Cup bid – which will have important economic and cultural benefits at both the domestic and international level.” USA Rugby said that “in addition to conveying congressional enthusiasm for the bid”, the resolution “encourages President Joe Biden and relevant federal agencies to support the bid committee in their ongoing efforts. It also pledges that Congress will give full consideration to legislative proposals or other requests to support preparations for these important events”. The governing body also said: “Co-ordination across local, state and federal government agencies is … ongoing. The bid leadership team has been in close contact with officials across all levels of government to discuss the commercial and cultural value of bringing one of the world’s largest sporting events to US soil for the first time.” There is a rugby fan in the White House. Biden has said he played at law school, and spoken fondly of following an All Blacks tour in Ireland when he was a young senator. The administration has not responded to Guardian requests for comment about the president’s playing and touring days. In November, however, Biden both wished Ireland’s men luck before their game against the All Blacks in Dublin and celebrated the stirring victory which followed.",Sport/Sport,USA Rugby World Cup bid attracts bipartisan support in Congress,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/03/usa-rugby-world-cup-bid-congress-resolution
3/4/2022,"Mehdi is free. After nearly nine years held within Australia’s immigration detention system, Mehdi Ali has flown out of the country to be resettled in the US. Mehdi – who this year became the public face of, and a powerful advocate for, the refugees and asylum seekers detained in Melbourne’s Park Hotel – arrived in Australia as a 15-year-old seeking sanctuary. A member of Iran’s routinely persecuted Ahwazi Arab minority, he was sent to Australia by his family, arriving by boat with his cousin, then 16-year-old Adnan Choopani, in 2013. Tonight I am free and leaving Australia to start my life in the United States of America. But I won't be happy until all my friends are get released from detention. It's not freedom until we are all free. Thank you all for your support. Mehdi, who goes by one name, was sent to Australia’s detention centre on Nauru, and experience that was, in his words, “a complete trauma”. He watched, helpless to intercede, as a fellow refugee burn himself to death, he was beaten by guards employed to protect him; and jailed without charge. The school he went to, the one light in a dark existence, was suddenly shuttered. The Nauru Files, internal working documents from the Nauru detention centre published in the Guardian in 2016, revealed widespread abuse of children in detention. Children were sexually assaulted, beaten, abused and suffered catastrophic mental health effects, leading to depression, suicide attempts and the rarely seen resignation syndrome. “In our first year detained in the camp on Nauru, I remember most of the asylum seekers were completely depressed,” Mehdi wrote in the days before he left Australia. “With my own eyes I witnessed the suicide of one soul destroyed by this island. Death by self-immolation was the worst scene I had watched in my life. This was the new reality for us on Nauru. We were there, my cousin and I, for six years.” Late in 2014, Mehdi and Choopani’s claim for refugee protection was formally recognised. They had a “well-founded fear of persecution” in their home country, and could not legally be returned there. Australia was legally obliged to protect them. Mehdi and Choopani were brought to Australia under the short-lived medevac laws in 2019 and spent more than two years in detention, shuttled – sometimes in handcuffs – between Brisbane and Melbourne. The pair was, they were regularly told, in the queue for resettlement in the US, but it was a queue that, for them, never appeared to move, and carried no guarantee it ever would. Mehdi watched as boatmates he arrived in Australia alongside leave detention to begin lives, careers and families in Australia. He watched, too, others succumb to despair and self-harm. He taught himself guitar, he wrote, and he campaigned for the release of all of those detained. Mehdi was told late last month he would be leaving for America. With Choopani, he decided, in his words “to leave quietly”. He had seen other refugees promised resettlement or release pack their belongings and leave for the airport, only to return, devastated a few hours later “The closer I get to the flight, the more scared and anxious I feel, but all of this turns into hope when I imagine calling and telling my family that I am finally free, and seeing their smiling faces,” he told Guardian Australia. “We fought for our lives. We suffered and we endured and we waited and we are still waiting. But the Australian Government’s crimes against refugees over the past decade are unforgivable, and to remain silent in the face of this oppression is unacceptable.” He marked nine birthdays in detention – the crucial, formative years from 15 to 24. His last birthday in detention was notable for the absurdity of sharing his detention hotel with the world’s number one tennis player Novak Djokovic. Djokovic’s handful of days in detention inadvertently exposed the plight of refugees and asylum seekers who had spent years trapped within Australia’s detention regime. “The birthdays,” Mehdi told the Guardian that day, “are the saddest days. They are supposed to be the happiest, but during my time in detention, they are always the heaviest days. I spend the whole day thinking about all the years I’ve lost.” Mehdi begins a new life in America today. He will be one of the last to be resettled under Australia’s refugee swap scheme with the US.

Almost 94,000 people are covered by 69 evacuation orders with a further 287,000 living in areas where evacuation warnings are in place, according to a NSW State Emergency Service spokesperson. Most are in the Sydney region, with residents in an area near Wisemans Ferry on the Hawkesbury-Nepean ordered to move to higher ground on Friday as the river continues to rise towards moderate flood levels, the ABC reported.

3/4/2022,"Two psychologists who devised the CIA’s post-9/11 system of US “enhanced interrogation”, which has been widely denounced as torture, cannot be called to testify in a case in Poland brought by a terrorism suspect subjected to the abuses, the supreme court has ruled. In a 6-3 ruling on Thursday, the court allowed the US government to block the psychologists from giving evidence in a case brought by Abu Zubaydah, a Guantánamo prisoner who was arrested in 2002 and has been held without charge ever since. The majority of the justices granted the government the privilege of “state secrets” – a power that prevents the public disclosure of information deemed harmful to national security. Zubaydah had wanted to call the psychologists, James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, to confirm that he had been unlawfully detained and tortured in a so-called CIA “black site” in Stare Kiejkuty, Poland. It is public knowledge that the prisoner was tortured in a number of black sites in several countries between 2002 and his transfer to Guantánamo four years later. Among the many harrowing torture techniques that were applied against him, he was waterboarded – a form of controlled drowning – 83 times. In Thursday’s ruling, the nine justices of the supreme court divided along unusual lines that crossed the traditional conservative-liberal divide. The majority opinion was written by Stephen Breyer, the court’s senior liberal justice who is retiring at the end of this term. In his opinion, Breyer argued that the government was entitled to assert the “state secrets” privilege even though the critical information in question – in this case the location of a CIA black site in Poland – was already publicly known. Breyer agreed with the CIA that “clandestine” relations between the US and foreign intelligence services were based on trust and had to be protected in the interests of national security. Two justices dissented from the opinion – the liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor and conservative Neil Gorsuch. In a lengthy rebuttal, Gorsuch pointed out that the torture to which Zubaydah was subjected had been extensively chronicled in official reports, books and movies. “Ending this suit may shield the government from some further modest measure of embarrassment. But respectfully, we should not pretend it will safeguard any secret,” he wrote. Elena Kagan, the court’s third liberal justice, stood apart from the majority opinion, arguing that the case should have been allowed to proceed in a lower court. Mark Denbeaux, a lead lawyer for Zubaydah, said that the court’s ruling would have a detrimental impact on public accountability. “More truth can’t come out. Whatever the psychologists would have said can’t come out. It’s just endless secrets.” Denbeaux added that the evocation of the state secrets privilege was entirely in line with the past 20 years in which the CIA had relentlessly labored to keep the details of the torture program from being revealed. “Even before they started to torture him the CIA demanded that if he died he would be cremated immediately and if he did not die he would be held incommunicado forever. And they have got what they wanted.” Though the Zubaydah case ultimately failed to dent the wall of secrecy that has been erected around the CIA’s torture program, it was remarkable in one other regard. When the supreme court heard arguments in the case in October, several of the justices openly referred to the prisoner’s interrogation as a form of torture. Amy Coney Barrett, one of the conservative justices appointed to the court by Donald Trump, talked about “the evidence of how he was treated and his torture”. It was the first time that the nation’s highest court had used the “torture” word with regard to Guantánamo detainees and their treatment in the wake of the terrorist attacks on 9/11.",News/Law,Supreme court blocks men behind CIA’s ‘enhanced interrogation’ from testifying,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/03/supreme-court-cia-enhanced-interrogation-block-testifying

3/4/2022,"We have barely had time to draw breath after the whirlwind anti-romance that was Inventing Anna, the story of super-grifter Anna Sorokin, who parlayed an innate grasp of upper-class manners into a life of plenty among the moneyed elite of New York (until they found out they were the ones funding it). Now we have The Dropout (Disney+), the story of the other great female fraudster of recent years, Elizabeth Holmes, founder of the medical company Theranos. It claimed it had developed technology that would revolutionise blood testing, and with it a massive part of the US healthcare system. In 2015, Forbes named Holmes the youngest self-made female billionaire in the country, after Theranos was valued at $9bn (£6.75bn). Her downfall, once rumours of fraud started circulating, was precipitate. She is now on bail awaiting sentencing for convictions for wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Unlike Inventing Anna, which was a heady, soapy rush that enjoyed the glamour of its protagonist, and wasn’t too bothered by any need to investigate her motivations, The Dropout plays it straight. Possibly too straight – there are times when a little levity as the impossibilities mount would not go amiss – but all in the service of a story that blows your mind quite as comprehensively as Sorokin’s. The storytelling is largely linear (a great relief after Inventing Anna’s back-and-forthing and the general fashion for importing tension via flashbacks and flash-forwards rather than actual writing). And so – brief opening scene of her giving a deposition before trial aside – we first meet Holmes as an 11-year-old child, running so slowly in a race that the rest of the runners have gathered at the finish line to wait, while the teacher begs her to give up. She does not, of course. There we have the essence of our antihero and this eight-hour miniseries. One is determined to succeed, the other determined to make its messages clear every step of the way. See also: mother laboriously depicted as self-centred and cold; father better, but emphatically a vice-president at scandal-hit accountancy firm Enron. It hits every traditional beat: mapping out the origins of Holmes’s particular interest (mother’s fear of needles); a montage of rejections as she tries to get her initial funding; the disaster in the lab as the last potential investor rounds the corner; her mesmerised walk around the room as she arrives in her first luxury hotel suite as CEO (never mind that Holmes was from a wealthy, well-connected family and was, we may safely assume, well-used to hot water and gathered curtains). So The Dropout is a lumbering beast, but saved by two things. The first is that it is simply such a good a story that you would have to deal it actual hammer blows to kill its fascination. Because – I’m sorry, did I not say? Tiny detail, often slipped the inventor’s mind, too – the technology did not work. Not properly. It worked a few times in a small way, just enough to give hope to those involved but, crucially, not on the day they showed it to investors. Holmes faked the results it apparently spewed out in front of them. From there, there was no going back. Its second saviour is the solid cast, led by Amanda Seyfried as Holmes. It’s a hugely skilful performance (even before she has to pull off Holmes’s famous vocal evolution), which manages to keep in balance all the disparate elements of a woman who seems, by all accounts, to have been a very strange admixture. She was demonstrably clever but slow to realise the value of “soft” skills, blunt but charming, hyperfocused but chaotic. Seyfried makes it all work and keeps our attention – even our sympathy – as Holmes’s desperation to make a name for herself and prove that her intelligence and drive are worth something tangible slips further and further into corruption and lies. Along the way, the show touches on issues that may have motivated Holmes to act the way she did – constantly proving herself the equal of the men at Stanford University, having to face down the tech bros of Silicon Valley, getting caught up with a manipulative older man, Sunny Balwani (played Naveen Andrews). But it doesn’t shy away from the fact that there was really only one person who built Theranos – from literally nothing, as it turned out – and who brought all $9bn of it down.",Arts/Television & radio,The Dropout review – another mind-blowing portrait of a great American fraudster,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/03/the-dropout-review-another-mind-blowing-portrait-of-a-great-american-fraudster
3/4/2022,"It was no surprise that, half an hour after the end of training was due, Steve Smith was the last man standing. Two days before Australia’s first Test match in Pakistan since 1998, the centre-wicket practice at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium that had been teeming with players saw their numbers dissipate through that spring afternoon. For a time Smith alternated batting with Usman Khawaja, facing Ashton Agar’s left-arm orthodox. Eventually, inevitably, it was just Smith, and one baseball-mitted coach throwing down ersatz spin. Just Smith in the Australian net, at least. On the far side of the same wicket square, having likewise outlasted his teammates, a couple of toilers bowled to Babar Azam. The symbolism was plain. On either side, shot for shot, each matched the other for assiduousness. The two who lead the batting for their teams, the two carrying most responsibility. Babar is a classical stylist who can play at modernity’s frantic tempo, and has risen to captain the side. He is also a metaphor for cricket’s resurrection in his country: after three years of a record far too modest for his gifts, he peeled off three centuries in consecutive matches as soon as Tests returned to Pakistan. Smith may not be the force he once was, but the defining aspect of his career has been the way he takes on new frontiers. Touring India in 2017, a place where Australia had been bereft of success, he dragged his team along with three centuries, narrowly missing a series win after taking it down to the last match. Touring England in 2019 the same scenario played out to the letter. He has been parlously short of Test cricket since then, but perhaps this tour to somewhere all but brand new could rouse that adventuring spirit again. Certainly his batting obsessiveness has gone nowhere. While sharing the centre, Khawaja would duck under the back of the surrounding netting and lean on his bat when it was Smith’s turn to face. When it was Khawaja’s turn, Smith couldn’t bring himself to leave. He would keep wicket, gather wide balls to return them, appeal at slip, all trussed up in his batting kit. After he got the place to himself, he moved the stumps all the way over to the back leg-side corner of the pitch, taking guard there so the ball could land in the roughest part of the batting footmarks. When it skidded through to bowl him he was unperturbed, honing how to play ugly if conditions did the same. Whether they will do that remains a mystery. Local scribes in the press box suggested the general preparation was off target: “Everyone is practising for spin but Pindi is a pace wicket.” On recent form this is true, with 52 wickets taken by pace compared to 21 by spin in the venue’s three recent matches. But it is also known as a surface that can break up, and even under bright sunshine two days before the match the pitch remained under covers to protect it from the sun. Accordingly, Australia’s selectors and the captain Patrick Cummins will largely be guessing when they choose between two spinners or their standard pace attack. Agar or leg-spinner Mitchell Swepson are the options to partner Nathan Lyon’s off spin. Equally selectors might reason that conditions offering spin can also offer reverse swing. Australia’s fast-bowling template of Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood has been preferred almost any time those three have been fit, so it is every chance to be rolled out again. Pakistan’s pace attack has the opposite situation: isolation for Haris Rauf, injury for Hasan Ali and Faheem Ashraf, and a late call-up for Naseem Shah from outside the original squad. The last time he played Australia, he was a 16-year-old toiling at the Gabba for the reward of dismissing David Warner on 154. The last time he played at Rawalpindi he was a 16-year-old taking a hat-trick. Now he’s all of 19, and will partner the most accomplished 21-year-old bowler in the world in Shaheen Shah Afridi. If Pakistan want a third quick then Mohammad Wasim Jr will have to take the job on little preparation. Spin and deep batting may be the choice, with a raft of all-rounders who twirl. For both sides, there is a fair bit of making this up as they go along. Australia declined a warm-up match in favour of staying longer in a training camp at home. Pakistan’s players have prepared by playing their domestic T20 competition. Demise by apoplexy threatens an entire demographic on reading this paragraph. But in a way, it all fits. Nobody knows how the teams will go. Nobody knows what the tour more broadly will bring. Nobody knows if we’ll get all the way through it. Nobody even knows what is under the cover. The only way to find out is to plunge in.",Sport/Sport,Australia plunge into unknown as cricket’s resurrection in Pakistan continues | Geoff Lemon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/04/australia-plunge-into-unknown-as-crickets-resurrection-in-pakistan-continues
3/4/2022,"The UK has sanctioned two new billionaire allies of Vladimir Putin, amid growing pressure to speed up the crackdown on Russian oligarchs, with delays blamed on legal issues and poor preparation. Amid widespread criticism of the delays to sanctioning more Kremlin allies, the Guardian understands ministers are set to reform “intimidation lawsuits” to crackdown on multimillion legal bills from oligarchs. The oligarchs Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov were added to the UK sanctions list on Thursday night, a week after it was announced there would be a “hitlist” of more than 100 oligarchs. Both will be cut off from their multimillion pound British mansions, with a full asset freeze and travel ban. The telecoms magnate Usmanov owns the £48m palatial Beechwood House in Highgate and the 16th-century Sutton Place estate in Surrey, and has had significant interests in the English football clubs Arsenal and Everton. Shuvalov, the former deputy Russian PM, has assets including two luxury apartments in central London worth an estimated £11m. Both have been sanctioned by the EU. In a coordinated move the US government announced “full blocking sanctions” on eight “Russian elites and their family members who enable Putin”. Those sanctioned include Usmanov and Shuvalov as well as Nikolai Tokarev, chief executive of the energy company Transneft, Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s press spokesperson, and Yevgeniy Prigozhin, a wealthy businessman nicknamed “Putin’s chef”. Whitehall insiders have warned that legal change is needed or the government’s full list could take as long as six months and blamed a lack of preparatory work in the run-up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, announced plans to establish a cross-government oligarch taskforce to help build cases against its targets. Government sources blamed the slow pace on amendments to the 2018 sanctions law, but the crossbench peer Lord Pannick who proposed the changes said they should not mean the UK must act slower than the EU, which has named significantly more individuals linked to Putin. The Guardian also understands the government is preparing to toughen up the long-delayed economic crime bill after pressure from Labour – including cutting the implementation period from 18 months to six for a new register revealing the ultimate owners of UK properties. Labour had called for a cut to 28 days. Government sources said Truss was pursuing changes to limit the amount of damages that could be incurred should those who have their assets frozen and seized for close ties to Putin’s regime challenge them in the courts. Truss has told government lawyers to “find literally any way” to crack down on so-called Slapp suits – the Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation technique – often used by the litigious and mega-wealthy to censor and intimidate journalists and activists by burdening them with huge legal costs they cannot meet. The justice secretary, Dominic Raab, is expected to launch a call for evidence on reforming Slapp cases, but it could take several weeks. Vladimir Ashurkov, a Russian political activist who was executive director of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, said such lawsuits were “acts of hybrid warfare which are used to weaken the UK’s democracy, judicial system and fundamental freedoms”. Meanwhile, there is widespread internal frustration that preparatory work for legal cases against a number of individual oligarchs has only just now begun, after months of warning about a Russian invasion. “It’s a big cross-Whitehall process between the Home Office and the Foreign Office – which should have started months ago – and it’s exposing the system’s weaknesses,” one Whitehall source said. “HMG is weeks behind where it should be.” The source emphatically denied it was a lack of political will and said senior cabinet ministers had been repeatedly raising the issue and asking questions about why the UK appeared behind. Two government sources said that the speed of the UK’s response had been hampered by the Sanctions Act of 2018, passed after Brexit, which makes the procedure legally cumbersome, with overstretched government lawyers now facing a vast caseload. They blamed extra protections brought in after amendments were proposed by Pannick and Lord Judge, the former lord chief justice of England and Wales. Pannick, who has previously represented a Russian individual challenging EU sanctions, said the changes should not mean the UK moved slower than the EU. “The sanctions regime rightly requires ministers to satisfy themselves that the proposed sanctions are ‘appropriate’ in the circumstances of the individual case, and to give reasons for a sanctions order. Any lesser test would be impossible to justify under the rule of law,” he said. “I cannot understand the government’s position. I cannot understand why these conditions should impede sanctions if there is a case for imposing them against an individual. Indeed, under EU law the same basic requirements apply.” Jason Hungerford, a senior corporate sanctions lawyer from Mayer Brown who serves on the Law Society’s money laundering taskforce, said ministers had broad scope since February this year to target oligarchs. “The EU can do it, and the EU moves more slowly than our brand new nimble system is supposed to. Our post-Brexit landscape isn’t a whole lot different than our pre-Brexit sanctions landscape. As far as how it works, it’s more or less the same.” Separately, Boris Johnson has also given his backing to the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, who is understood to be considering plans to toughen up the government’s powers so that sanctioned oligarchs’ properties could be seized without compensation – rather than just frozen. One government aide said that requisitioning individuals’ property “jars” with the UK’s tradition of upholding the rule of law, and offering security to investors – though they denied there was any dissent within government about pressing ahead. “We are going full tonto on this, within the parameters of the rule of law,” the aide said.",News/World news,UK imposes sanctions on Russian billionaire and former deputy PM,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/uk-imposes-sanctions-on-russian-billionaire-and-former-deputy-pm
3/4/2022,"Todd Boehly and Hansjörg Wyss are increasingly confident that their bid to buy Chelsea will be successful and are set to step up negotiations with Roman Abramovich this weekend. Abramovich has confirmed he wants to end his ownership of Chelsea and it is believed that the Russian oligarch wants a sale to go through quickly. A deadline of 15 March has been set for interested parties, with the US bank Raine tasked with making the sale, but Boehly and Wyss have stolen a march on rival bidders and are expected to have made their opening offer by Sunday night. Wyss, a Swiss billionaire, first revealed that he could join a consortium trying to buy Chelsea to the Swiss newspaper Blick. The 86-year-old has partnered with Boehly, who part-owns the LA Dodgers, and the pair are hopeful that an agreement will be reached soon. They have finalised the other partners joining them but the identity of those other figures is not known yet. Boehly reportedly had a £2.2bn bid for Chelsea rejected in 2019 and is the co-founder, chairman and CEO of the US company Eldridge Industries, which invests in sectors including media and sport. Wyss has previously worked with Boehly at Eldridge and has flown from Switzerland to California to work on the proposal with his fellow bidder. The Swiss is the founder and the former president and chairman of Synthes Holding AG, a medical device manufacturer, and a supporter of liberal and environmental causes in the US, where he lived for a number of years. Wyss told Blick that Abramovich’s asking price was too high. It has been reported that Abramovich wants as much as £4bn but financial experts have said he is unlikely to receive much more than £2bn. A problem for Abramovich’s valuation is the size of Stamford Bridge, which has a 41,837 capacity and is difficult to redevelop. Born in Bern, Switzerland, 19 September 1935. He studied engineering, earned an MBA from Harvard, then worked in textiles in Asia and Europe. As a sideline he sold planes – with one sale introducing him to the co-founder of the Swiss medical device manufacturer Synthes. Wyss went on to found Synthes USA in 1977 and, in 2012, he sold it to Johnson & Johnson for $19.7bn (£14.8bn). What is he worth now? A more modest $5.8bn (£4.3bn), having, in 2013, signed the Giving Pledge set up by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, committing to give away most of his fortune. His Wyss Foundation – focused on environmentalism and progressive, anti-Trump politics – holds over $2bn in assets. In 2018 he pledged to donate $1bn (£751m) to environmental causes.  Any controversies? His financial influence on US politics, as a non-US citizen, has drawn criticism – but he remains focused on pushing an anti-populist agenda. Asked about Brexit in 2019, Wyss told Swiss paper Neue Zürcher Zeitung how voters had been “deceived by populist statements... For the British people’s sake, I hope that there will be another vote when all the facts are on the table.”  So why Chelsea? He hasn’t shared his vision, but the 86-year-old Wyoming resident isn’t going it alone, with the part-owner of the LA Dodgers, Todd Boehly, forming part of a consortium. Boehly, an investor, billionaire and fellow philanthropist, had a solo takeover bid for Chelsea rejected in 2019 and has previously been linked with Tottenham. He told Bloomberg at the time: ""One of the great things the Premier League has is that it’s on a Saturday morning in America. So you have an uncongested time slot that is now fully dominated by the Premier League. When I was growing up, Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, but certainly I didn’t know about Manchester United, I didn’t know about Chelsea, I didn’t know about Tottenham. Kids these days are fully aware of what’s the best and the Premier League is the best. I continue to believe there is a global opportunity for the best clubs.” David Hills There is a need for the bid to move swiftly. Abramovich has been under pressure since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and it is unlikely a sale will be permitted if he is sanctioned by the UK government. Abramovich has vehemently denied allegations that he has any links to Vladimir Putin and the Russian state, or that he has done anything to merit being sanctioned. Sources have said at least one other group is preparing to make an offer this week. There have also been suggestions that the Egyptian businessman Loutfy Mansour, who has a Chelsea season ticket, has been considering a bid. Attempts to reach Mansour on Thursday were unsuccessful. A spokesperson for Sir Jim Ratcliffe denied the Ineos chairman would join the bidding. The chief executive of the Premier League, Richard Masters, said Abramovich was right to sell. “The situation escalated incredibly quickly and it was the right solution because the position was unsustainable,” Masters said at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit. “The sooner the sale process completes, the sooner everyone has certainty.” Asked how quickly a sale could happen, Masters said: “The quickest any deal has taken is 10 days. That’s not to say that deal can’t be beaten but it would normally take a number of weeks and it all depends on the complexity of the deal. Provided the information is easily accessible, easily understandable and were given all the right answers it can be done relatively quickly. If the owner is sanctioned by the UK, I don’t think it will work.” Abramovich’s position had been uncertain since he announced plans last Saturday to transfer the stewardship and care of Chelsea to trustees of the club’s charitable foundation. That proposal, which met with resistance from the trustees, is expected to be shelved. It is unlikely the chairman, Bruce Buck, and powerful director Marina Granovskaia will stay under new owners. However sources have indicated Granovskaia could have a future at the club. She is closely linked to Abramovich but is highly respected in football and has a strong relationship with Chelsea’s manager, Thomas Tuchel. The feeling is that Granovskaia could be an asset to Chelsea if she cuts her ties with Abramovich. It is unclear how the prospect of a takeover will affect Chelsea’s football operation. It is thought that talks with players over new contracts could be put on hold. The defenders Antonio Rüdiger, Andreas Christensen and César Azpilicueta are out of contract at the end of the season. Barcelona want Azpilicueta and Christensen, who is also a target for Bayern Munich.",Sport/Football,Wyss and Boehly confident of deal to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/03/hansjorg-wyss-and-todd-boehly-confident-of-deal-to-buy-chelsea-from-roman-abramovich
