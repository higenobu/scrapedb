2/5/2022,"A day after the International Olympic Committee tried to claim these Games should be free of politics, the Chinese Communist Party staged an Opening Ceremony draped in dual-track political messaging for audiences both inside China and out that was as loud and clear as the fireworks that lit up the Beijing sky. It was a sign of both Chinese strength in its ability to use the Olympics to spread its narrative and its hidden terror at the truth actually seeping out. It ended with an affront to the sensibilities and a middle finger to much of the world, whose prominent governments — including the United States, India, Great Britain, Australia and Canada — refused to send diplomats to grant this absurdity any measure of legitimacy. The Olympic cauldron was lit — a symbolic moment of prominence — on Friday in Beijing by two Chinese athletes, including Dinigeer Yilamujiang, a cross country skier, who, according to the state-run media, has Uyghur heritage. That choice, a female Uyghur, was a direct shot at outside groups and governments who have condemned China for its treatment against Muslim ethic minorities who mostly reside in the far northwest part of the country. Numerous governments, including the United States, and numerous human rights organizations — Amnesty International and United Nations experts, among them — have concluded China is waging genocide against the Uyghurs after some members of the ethnic group began demanding a measure of cultural independence in 2014. China has denied the allegation and its response was, perhaps, even more direct than imaginable. In a signature moment of the Olympics, with massive audiences both inside the country and around the globe, it sent a Uyghur woman to essentially declare all is good and what you’ve heard isn’t true. Well, that’s the Chinese story, at least. But if the CCP is going to use Dinigeer Yilamujiang as a prop for its story, then let her also serve as a chance for the rest of the world to learn about her people. There is universal consensus among governments, independent groups and international journalists about what is happening in the Xinjiang province. It was reached despite the enormous risks politically, economically or even for security reasons in taking on China. Slavery. Forced sterilization. The imprisonment of perhaps 1 million Uyghurs. Re-education camps. The erasing of culture. Rapes, beatings, mandated abortions, starvations and every other form of torture imaginable. “The evidence is overwhelming,” Williams Nee of the Chinese Human Rights Defenders and a former analyst for Amnesty International told Yahoo Sports. China denies it, but it has also denied the United Nation’s own high commissioner for human rights access to the area. No matter, there are satellite images of the camps, testimony from Uyghurs who escaped as refugees, and reports from independent groups and journalists who snuck in. Everything is geared to making the Uyghurs comply with the Chinese central government and Han culture, even if that means ensuring fewer Uyghurs exist, both now and in the future. The racism is appalling. Any objectors can be used to work the cotton fields so the government can profit off their instance on basic human dignity. The Uyghurs, among others in the region, “face systematic, state-organized mass imprisonment, torture and persecution amounting to crimes against humanity,” Amnesty International stated in 2021. “It should shock the conscience of humanity that massive numbers of people have been subjected to brainwashing, torture and other degrading treatment in internment camps, while millions more live in fear amid a vast surveillance apparatus,” the report stated. If Chinese president Xi Jinping wants an Olympic torch to say there is nothing to see here, well, let the rest of the world that lives outside of his state-controlled media and internet firewalls take the time to look longer and harder and consider what, in even the smallest of ways, they can do to help. Let this backfire. Let this draw attention to this state-run terrorism. Let this become a global movement. Let this grow so loud that it drowns out the IOC’s pathetic willingness to be used as a propaganda prop this month — an effort complete with a pathetic, humiliating, all but written-by-Beijing-speech from IOC President Thomas Bach, for whom history will forever condemn. “They wanted the IOC to send the message that this wasn’t about politics and then make it all about politics,” Nee said. “They want to show to their own people and the world, especially the Muslim world, an image of ethic unity. But you can’t say everything is fine and not let the United Nations, or anyone else, in to investigate.” Let it extend to other global businesses, organizations and prominent people. Let this be the tipping point. This is why the United States and others engaged in a “diplomatic boycott” of these Games. No U.S. government officials were there to witness, and thus lend credence to, this mass brainwashing. The athletes, who want to be there, will be able to compete. It’s an individual choice, not a government mandate. The fact Dinigeer Yilamujiang lit the cauldron, however, shows that China was stung by the boycott and was angry about the lack of American, British and other dignitaries in Beijing on Friday. It also showed it is concerned about the narrative, its fear about the truth leaking out. A hit dog will bark and China was howling on Friday. It needed, in the biggest way possible, to try to message its own people and those around the world that if they happen to have heard about any trouble with the Uyghurs — if they heard about the rapes and the imprisonments and the torture and the slavery, if the growing noise about these atrocities had reached them — well, it isn’t true. Just look at the happy, healthy, smiling face of Dinigeer Yilamujiang as she fired up that cauldron. Well, the cauldron is lit. Now let the rest of the world follow its glow toward the truth.",World/Yahoo Sports,The 2022 Olympics Opening Ceremony revealed this truth: China has a lot to hide,https://news.yahoo.com/the-2022-olympic-opening-ceremony-revealed-this-truth-china-has-a-lot-to-hide-175017821.html
2/5/2022,"Emails obtained by government watchdog group American Oversight suggest that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has been in regular contact with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. The June 2021 emails, reported by Politico on Friday, were sent by conservative activist Ginni Thomas to someone in the DeSantis administration requesting that the governor join a meeting organized in part by Judicial Watch, a right-wing group that frequently sues public officials.

Ron DeSantis is in regular contact with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. In a June 2021, Ginni Thomas said DeSantis should be familiar with her because “my husband has been in contact with him[.]” pic.twitter.com/R8Sj3thLgC — American Oversight (@weareoversight) February 4, 2022 Ginni Thomas has long been intimately involved with several conservative groups that make no secret about where they stand on Supreme Court decisions. The New Republic noted recently, for example, that in 2000, Thomas, then a staffer at the conservative Heritage Foundation, screened resumes for Bush administration employees while the court had yet to rule on the legality of the Florida recount. (In a 5-4 decision, in which Clarence Thomas participated despite calls to recuse himself, the court put a stop to the recount.) A more recent example, as noted by The New Yorker‘s Jane Mayer, pertains to Ginni Thomas’ role on the advisory board of the conservative group Turning Point USA, which transported busloads of insurrectionists to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6. Last month, the court ruled 8-1 that ex-president Donald Trump must hand over documents to the House Jan. 6 committee. The lone dissenter? Clarence Thomas These are just two of several instances of Ginni Thomas, who worries that America is danger of falling into the hands of “transsexual fascists,” presenting a conflict of interest to the court. As Stephen Gillers, an NYU law professor and a judicial ethicist, told Mayer, “I think Ginni Thomas is behaving horribly, and she’s hurt the Supreme Court and the administration of justice. It’s reprehensible. If you could take a secret poll of the other eight justices, I have no doubt that they are appalled by Virginia Thomas’ behavior. But what can they do?” Friday’s report is sure to raise questions about whether DeSantis communicated with Clarence Thomas about, say, vaccine mandate cases that came before the court last month. The Biden administration’s mandate for health care workers was upheld in a 5-4 ruling, with Thomas dissenting, while the mandate for large businesses was overturned 6-3, with Thomas in the majority. DeSantis opposed both mandates. Helen Aguirre Ferré, the executive director of the Republican Party of Florida, told Politico, “I can’t speak about any private conversations Governor DeSantis may or may not have had with anyone but both he and Justice Thomas believe in the separation of powers and defend individual liberty, the law and the Constitution as written.” DeSantis’ office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Rolling Stone.

2/5/2022,"The Beijing Winter Olympics are officially underway—but, before the Opening Ceremony even finished on Friday, Chinese authorities proved to the world once again that it won’t tolerate any kind of free press. In an extraordinary clip from Dutch broadcaster NOS, one of its reporters who is in Beijing to cover the Games can be seen being manhandled by a security guard sporting a red armband. The reporter, Sjoerd den Daas, attempted to carry on his broadcast while being grabbed and yelled at by the guard, then NOS decided to cut away back to the studio. In a post, NOS wrote: “Our correspondent [den Daas] was pulled away from the camera by security guards at 12:00 pm live in the NOS Journaal. Unfortunately, this is increasingly becoming a daily reality for journalists in China. He is fine and was able to finish his story a few minutes later.” It’s unclear exactly what den Daas did to upset the authorities, but it may have been that he was reporting from a dark street corner rather than from inside the glitzy Bird’s Nest stadium, where the Chinese government was staging an opening ceremony to show off China to the world. The Dutch tabloid Algemeen Dagblad quoted NOS editor-in-chief Marcel Gelauff as saying the clip was “a painful illustration” of how foreign press is treated in China. “Sjoerd has often told and shown that it is difficult as a journalist in China. There is a far-reaching tendency to curtail freedoms, and this may be even stronger because of corona,” said Gelauff. Reporters in Beijing have been subjected to strict pandemic protocols before and during their time in the city, including the mandatory use of a health-monitoring app and daily PCR tests. Some foreign journalists have been told to leave their cell phones at home and use burners to stop Chinese spooks from tracking their activities. A report from the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China released last month found foreign journalists have faced increasing intimidation in the country in recent years, with tactics including social media trolling, assaults, account hacking, visa denials, and vexatious lawsuits. Inside the stadium, the was even more controversy during the opening ceremony when Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to shut his eyes when the team from Ukraine was parading around the track.

Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping received a one-minute standing ovation when he arrived to watch the festivities. Earlier in the day, Putin and Xi co-signed a statement that warned the West to stay away from Ukraine as NATO allies bolster their defenses in Eastern Europe. BBC News reported that the team representing Russia—named the Russian Olympic Committee due to the ban on Russia fielding its national team because of persistent drug cheating—had “the loudest cheer so far” when it entered the stadium.

2/5/2022,"NEW DELHI (AP) — India will not attend Friday's opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics, after one of the torchbearers reportedly chosen by Chinese authorities riled up New Delhi's anger. India's foreign affairs spokesman Arindam Bagchi on Thursday said it was “regrettable that the Chinese side has chosen to politicize an event like the Olympics.” The move followed reports in China's state-owned Global Times that a Chinese military commander, who was involved in deadly clashes with Indian border forces in 2020, had been chosen as one of many torchbearers charged with relaying the Olympics flame to Beijing. The 2020 fighting erupted along the disputed border with China in eastern Ladakh. Chinese troops killed 20 Indian soldiers, while China said it lost four soldiers. The spokesman added that the Indian Embassy in Beijing would also not send a representative to the closing ceremonies. The U.S., along with several countries including Australia, Britain and Canada, have announced a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics, citing China’s human rights violations, while allowing their athletes to compete.

2/5/2022,"By Luc Cohen and Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) -Lawyer Michael Avenatti, who rose to fame for taking on then-U.S. President Donald Trump before a slew of criminal charges ended his legal career, was convicted on Friday of defrauding a former client, porn star Stormy Daniels. Avenatti, who faces up to 22 years behind bars, had pleaded not guilty to charges he embezzled https://www.reuters.com/world/us/michael-avenatti-us-lawyer-who-battled-trump-goes-trial-fraud-case-2022-01-24 nearly $300,000 in book proceeds intended for Daniels. The verdict by a federal jury in Manhattan followed a two-week trial in which the brash, 50-year-old lawyer represented himself. Avenatti, who is based in Los Angeles, agreed that he would surrender himself to U.S. marshals in California on Feb 7. Sentencing was scheduled for May 24. Following the verdict, Avenatti, who was wearing a black mask, looked between the jury and down at the table. Daniels, the prosecution's star witness https://www.reuters.com/world/us/porn-star-stormy-daniels-testifies-against-fallen-lawyer-michael-avenatti-2022-01-27, testified that Avenatti had led her to believe her publisher had not disbursed advance payments totaling $297,500 for her memoir, ""Full Disclosure,"" when she asked in 2018 and early 2019 about the delays. She said she later learned that Avenatti had diverted the money to an account he controlled, without telling her. ""I felt very betrayed and stupid,"" Daniels said. ""Michael had been lying and stealing from me."" Avenatti downplayed the dispute as a disagreement over legal fees. He said his contract with Daniels, 42, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, entitled him to a reasonable share of her book and media proceeds. Avenatti called no witnesses https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/avenatti-does-not-plan-testify-his-defense-stormy-daniels-us-fraud-case-2022-01-31 and did not testify in his own defense. The highlight of the trial was Avenatti's five-hour cross-examination of Daniels, where he sought to undermine his former client's credibility by exposing her interest in paranormal activities https://www.reuters.com/world/us/michael-avenatti-cross-examines-ex-client-stormy-daniels-his-fraud-trial-2022-01-28. Daniels, who is producing a documentary-style ghosthunting TV show called ""Spooky Babes,"" testified that she believed she could speak with the dead. The spectacle of Avenatti questioning Daniels capped a public falling-out for a pair who became cable TV mainstays in 2018 for cases they brought against Trump. Daniels is known for receiving $130,000 in hush money from Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in exchange for remaining quiet ahead of the 2016 election about sexual encounters she says she had with Trump, which he has denied. Avenatti was successful in freeing Daniels from her nondisclosure agreement with Trump. He gained widespread recognition through frequent television appearances that made him a hero to some Trump opponents, prompting him to flirt with running for the White House as a Democrat in 2020 against the Republican president. But Avenatti was hit with dozens of criminal charges in March and April 2019 accusing him of cheating Daniels, defrauding several other clients, trying to extort up to $25 million from Nike Inc, and other crimes. He is appealing his conviction and 2-1/2-year prison sentence in the Nike case. A federal court trial in California over the other alleged client frauds, in which Avenatti also represented himself, ended in a mistrial. The remaining charges have yet to be tried.

No other injuries were reported. “The gun, which belongs to the child’s father, who was not there at the time of the shooting, was left under a seat,” NBC News detailed with insight from the sheriff. “The mother and her friend did not know the weapon was there.” Lopinto also shared the adults involved admitted to using marijuana at the time of the tragic incident, although no weed was recovered from the vehicle. According to the sheriff, the two have remained cooperative throughout the ongoing investigation. “These types of deaths can certainly be prevented,” Lopinto said at a news conference. “I don’t think it was appropriate to make an arrest on this at this point,” he added. “They’ve just lost a child. It certainly wasn’t intentional by any means.” “We shouldn’t ever leave a gun inside of a vehicle for numerous different reasons,” Lopinto said, “This one being the most tragic reason.” RELATED CONTENT: “Louisiana Officer Dies From COVID-19 A Day Before Wedding”",U.S./Madame Noire,4-Year-Old Shoots Himself In Car While Mother Smokes Weed In Front Seat,https://news.yahoo.com/4-old-shoot-himself-car-130708178.html
2/5/2022,"Rudy Giuliani said if Trump had imposed martial law to stay in power, they would end up behind bars, NYT reported. If Trump had taken that step, Giuliani reportedly told an associate, ""we would all end up in prison."" Trump did not impose martial law but envisioned multiple scenarios in which federal agencies seized voting machines. Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani said that if then President Donald Trump had imposed martial law in an effort to overturn the 2020 election results, the former president and many of his aides would have wound up behind bars. That's according to Patrick Byrne, the former head of Overstock, who told The New York Times that Giuliani recently explained to him that he advised Trump against imposing martial law because ""we would all end up in prison."" The Times has previously reported on Giuliani's opposition to instituting martial law. Despite his own endorsement of outlandish conspiracy theories about voter and election fraud, he became alarmed when former national security advisor Michael Flynn and former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell suggested imposing martial law. According to the paper, Flynn, Powell, and Byrne went to the Oval Office on December 18, 2020 and laid out a plan that involved deploying the military to seize voting machines and ballots in key battleground states. Giuliani waited until Flynn and Powell had left the Oval Office and told Trump that their plan would get him impeached, the report said. Giuliani's lawyer did not immediately respond to The Times' request for comment. Trump ultimately heeded Giuliani's advice and did not impose martial law. But he did consider scenarios in which federal agencies like the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense would seize voting machines, the report said. In one case, Trump met with then attorney general William Barr in the Oval Office after the election and asked him to use the Justice Department to take voting machines. But Barr immediately rejected the request. In December, roughly six weeks after Election Day 2020, Trump told Giuliani to ask if the DHS had the legal power to seize voting machines in key battleground states, The Times previously reported. But the department's acting deputy secretary said he didn't have that authority. The House select committee investigating the Capitol riot also recently obtained a draft executive order that directed the Secretary of Defense to ""seize"" voting machines. It's unclear who wrote the draft, and The Times reported that Trump had rejected a request by his outside advisors to use the Pentagon to take control of the machines. Trump ultimately did get impeached a second time after the House of Representatives accused him of inciting the failed insurrection on January 6, 2021. Flynn, meanwhile, repeatedly called on Trump to use the military to stay in power. The same week that he and Powell went to the Oval Office to urge Trump to lay out their proposal, Flynn appeared on the far-right outlet Newsmax and said Trump should deploy the military and hold another election. But those remarks aren't based in reality. Despite Republican claims of fraud and election rigging, nonpartisan officials and election experts confirmed that the 2020 election was the safest and most secure in US history. The president does not have the power to unilaterally cancel, delay, postpone, or change the date of an election, even if he declares martial law. As Business Insider previously reported, that power lies with Congress. Declaring martial law also does not suspend the Constitution, and the military has no role in administering elections. Even if it did, it would not be able to run new elections because the right to vote is not specified in the Constitution or by a federal statute.

2/5/2022,"John Cena has become a prominent Hollywood actor after a long WWE career. Cena says he adopted yoga so he could be better at stunts, by losing weight and getting more flexible. ""I immediately lost 20 pounds, which was very difficult for me. I even fell into a weird depression,"" he said. John Cena's journey from a professional wrestling star to a Hollywood actor involved an emotional reflection on his body and fitness routine, he told GQ. Cena, once the most popular wrestler in the WWE, has followed a career path, similar to Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, from scripted sports into the mainstreams of Hollywood films, and now stars in his own HBO Max series ""The Peacemaker,"" which became one of the most-watched shows in the world in January. But the 44-year-old actor said one of the most important new workouts on his journey into his new industry was yoga which he took up while filming ""Snafu,"" with Jackie Chan, which is slated to release in 2022 in China. The 6-foot-1 Cena weighed 251 lbs during his WWE career, but said he lost 20 lbs when he switched his routine to prioritize yoga. ""They could care less about how strong I was. They just wanted me to kick over my head, which was impossible,"" Cena told GQ. ""I went over there to train with him for about three months and they stretched me like taffy. I immediately lost 20 pounds, which was very difficult for me. I even fell into a weird depression because it was like 'I'm losing everything that I worked on for 30 years!'"" Yoga is an effective workout for weight loss. But losing lots of weight quickly can affect a person's mental health and can be linked to depression. A study at University College London examined 1,979 people in the UK with a BMI classified as overweight or obese. They found that people who lost more than 5% of their bodyweight were 52% more likely to report depression than those who shed pounds but stayed closer to their original weight, via Time Magazine. Cena said doing yoga regularly helped him physically, and over time strengthened the connection between his body and mind — one of the reported benefits of yoga. ""It actually keeps me present and in tune with my body. If I had anything in my mental backpack on the way into the gym, it's gone by the time I leave,"" Cena told GQ. ""I begin to walk taller, begin to have less pain, I was more flexible, and that experience changed my life in many ways, and it taught me the value of making sure your body moves OK."" Yoga is a popular workout among pro athletes in the NFL and NBA, used by stars like LeBron James and Aaron Rodgers, for its reported benefits of improving flexibility, and mobility, and being injury prevention practice. When Cena performed in the WWE, he said his workout routine mostly consisted of heavy weightlifting to build large muscles. But yoga helped Cena take an approach aimed at improving mobility and flexibility. ""In yoga, the concept is that you need to be present because we're going to stretch you farther than you think you can go,"" he told GQ. Cena told Metro that he does most of his own stunts for ""The Peacemaker,"" and yoga could be a big reason why. But the actor said it's also just going to improve his life overall. ""My training has switched a lot because I'm old. I'm going to be 45 this year,"" Cena told GQ. ""Now, I'm trying to be able to lift weights when I'm 80, so I need to take a little bit more care of myself for the long term.""

The hill farmer from Upper Teesdale said he had been forced to take action after he came under attack from a ""strutting and agitated"" shirtless youth, who had refused to move the car from his land. Mr Hooper said he did not call police because he had been burgled eight times and found they were often slow to respond. He went on trial at Durham Crown Court after being charged with dangerous driving and criminal damage. But he was acquitted of all charges after telling the jury: “An Englishman's home is his castle and my castle starts at that front gate."" Michael Rawlinson, his barrister, told the court that the origins of the phrase could be traced back to 1604, when Sir Edward Coke was the attorney general of England. ""This whole case is about an Englishman's home being his castle and his right to lawful self-defence of himself and his property,"" explained Mr Rawlinson. In an early 17th century ruling, known as Semayne's case, Sir Edward stated: “The house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress as well for defence against injury and violence, as for his repose. ""If theeves [sic] come to a man’s house to rob him, or murder, and the owner or his servants kill any of the theeves in defence of himself and his house, it is no felony, and he shall lose nothing."" The case against Mr Hooper also became a town versus country debate, with the farmer and his neighbours railing against people who had used their isolated, rural community as a playground during lockdown. The court heard how Elliott Johnson and Charlie Burn, his passenger, had parked the Vauxhall Corsa on Mr Hooper's land when the vehicle suffered a double blow-out. They were making their way home to Tyneside after spending the day at Low Force waterfall with five friends. Mr Hooper, who had been sillaging and bailing, drove down to speak to the driver to explain the car was blocking access to his field. He told the court: ""I said: 'Now then lads, can we have this car moved, I need to be in and out.' ""Instantly, Burns was right in my face. Throughout Covid we'd been two metres from people and here he was five inches from my nose. He was on edge and agitated and full of himself. ""I asked him politely again: 'Can we have this car moved?' and he said: 'I'm not f—--g moving this car. “With that he punched me in the face, which rather shocked me. I said I was only asking him to move the car. "" Fearful that they might have weapons, Mr Hooper said he then climbed into his telehandler and, using the forks, picked up the back of the car and pushed it onto the road. However, the car clipped a post of the farm gate and flipped over, causing massive damage. A video of the incident was uploaded to social media and quickly went viral.

Who's gonna win this one? pic.twitter.com/NpLbGDuxR7 — Jeremy Vine (@theJeremyVine) June 7, 2021 Mr Hooper said he and his neighbours in Upper Teesdale had been plagued by anti-social behaviour during lockdown, with an influx of tourists. He said: “There has been anti-social behaviour, drug-taking, people lighting fires, knocking walls down and blocking the roads with parking, causing a threat to people as well."" Jacky Meeson, his neighbour, who was also called to give evidence, said: “Our area became very popular because of the rivers and countryside and hordes of people came out who were not used to being in the countryside but wanted some freedom. ""With that came a lack of respect for the countryside and the people who live there. There was a general feeling of being invaded by something we were not used to."" Mr Hooper denied dangerous driving and criminal damage and argued that he had been acting in self-defence. Surrounded by a dozen of his friends and neighbours, Mr Hooper hugged Karen Henderson, his partner of six years, as the verdict was delivered. Speaking outside court, Ms Henderson said: “The support of his local community and also people from afar has kept him going through these last eight months of hell, which have been terrible. ""The whole thing has been such an ordeal for him, he's not someone who likes to be the centre of attention so this has been difficult. ""It's been wonderful to see so many people from the Dales come to support him, that really means a lot."" William Wearmouth, a 66-year-old farmer who was also one of those who made the journey to court from Upper Teesdale, said: “Robert Hooper is a decent, honest man, the hardest working man in the Dale and the jury got it right. ""He did nothing wrong, he was under attack and he did what he had to do to protect himself and his property. ""Since lockdown, the Dale has been deluged by people who visit and don't really understand the country. ""We all understood what he went through because we all saw the way people, young people especially, were behaving and causing disruption to everyone's lives.”",World/The Telegraph,Farmer who flipped car cleared of criminal damage because ‘Englishman’s home is his castle’,https://news.yahoo.com/farmer-flipped-car-cleared-criminal-163539424.html
2/5/2022,"We’ve grown up alongside them, marveled at their skill, their will and their brilliance. We’ve cheered their immeasurable accomplishments, from jointly setting up children’s charities, to each winning the heavyweight title multiple times, to both earning doctorate degrees to one becoming the mayor of Ukraine’s biggest city. Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko can’t be true. They have to be the product of an author’s fertile mind and vivid imagination. You don’t meet guys who are as physically gifted in athletics but who are smarter than they are athletic, and whose devotion to country has proven to be boundless. Boxers put their lives at risk every day they go to work by the very nature of their jobs. These guys put their lives at risk in order to try to improve the everyday lives of their countrymen. But for all the risks they took in combining to win 109 bouts in 117 boxing matches with 94 knockouts and more than 40 wins between them in title bouts, it pales in comparison to what these brothers have taken on for their country. Vitali Klitschko, 50, has been mayor of Kiev since June 5, 2014. He was a leader in the protests against government corruption of 2013 and 2014, in which he was the most visible and upfront figure. Even when the government used violence to quell the protest, Vitali Klitschko was not only the face of the opposition, he was front and center. They face an even more dangerous opponent today. Russian president Vladimir Putin seems to have been planning an invasion of Ukraine, which the Biden Administration has desperately been trying to prevent. Russia has thousands of troops along its border with Ukraine. So what did Wladimir Klitschko do? He joined the Ukraine’s military reserve. Mayor Vitali Klitschko told Reuters a diplomatic solution is preferred, but he wasn’t backing down even though Putin is infinitely more dangerous than anyone who ever stepped into a boxing ring. “If [a diplomatic solution can’t be found], we have to prepare to take weapons in our hands and defend the country,” he said. He’s the living embodiment of the kind of leadership American Gen. George S. Patton spoke of during World War II when he said, “Always do everything you ask of those you command.” Should it come to it, the mayor and his brother could be out there in fatigues, with a helmet on and a gun slung over their shoulders, prepared to stare down the Russian invaders. Fighters often say they’re willing to die in the ring; the Klitschko brothers are proving they’re willing to die for what they believe in. Unless the U.S. gets involved by sending troops, which would be hugely unpopular in an election year, Ukraine would stand very little chance against the powerful Russian military. And as the most public of figures, the Klitschkos would undoubtedly be targets of the Putin regime. We far too often anoint athletes as heroes for their feats on the playing field, and rarely is that honor deserved. These gigantic brothers are every bit the heroes in their everyday lives that they’ve been made to be for their exploits in the ring. They’re far from the only athletes willing to die for their country. On Dec. 9, 1941, two days after President Franklin Delano Roosevelt called Dec. 7, 1941, “a date which will live in infamy,” Cleveland Indians pitcher Bob Feller joined the Navy and earned six campaign ribbons and eight battle stars while rising to the rank of captain. Arizona Cardinals safety Pat Tillman enlisted in the military, leaving a seven-figure NFL contract, only days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Tillman was tragically killed by friendly fire. The great major-league hitter Ted Williams gave up five years of his career to serve both in World War II and the Korean War. He flew 40 combat missions. These are the kinds of people that Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko are following. There's hope that the administration will be able to broker a peaceful solution and that there will be no need for anyone in Ukraine and Russia to bear arms. If the need arises, though, the Klitschko brothers will be there, and not just blending into the crowd.",World/Yahoo Sports,Heroic Klitschko brothers proving they’re willing to die for their country amid Ukraine-Russia crisis,https://news.yahoo.com/heroic-klitschko-brothers-proving-theyre-willing-to-die-for-their-country-amid-ukraine-russia-crisis-170656445.html

 Former President Trump and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) spoke on the phone for 10 minutes the morning of the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol in 2021, two sources told CNN. The two sources reviewed call records the Jan. 6 House committee received from the National Archives last month. Jordan has previously said he spoke to Trump on the day of the Capitol riot, but has been inconsistent about when the two talked or for how long. ""I talked to the president a number of times that day, but I don't remember the times,"" Jordan told CNN on Friday when questioned about the 10-minute call. Jordan said he could ""not recall"" when the two specifically talked, but said he knows ""I talked to him after we left off the floor."" Jordan spoke on the floor around 1:30 p.m. that day to reject Biden's electors from Arizona and again around 10:30 p.m., after legislators returned to the Capitol following the attack, according to CNN. Jordan told CNN he could not remember how long he talked to the president. The committee is also investigating other communications Jordan had leading up to the riot, including with Trump's former chief of staff, Mark Meadows. Jordan and the Jan. 6 panel clashed last month when Jordan said he would no longer voluntarily cooperate with the investigation. ""Mr. Jordan has admitted that he spoke directly to President Trump on January 6th and is thus a material witness. Mr. Jordan's letter to the committee fails to address these facts,"" the committee said in response to Jordan's refusal to cooperate anymore. The committee alleged ""the Trump team has persuaded him to try to hide the facts and circumstances of January 6th,"" but did not provide any evidence for the statement.

Police Service Chief Peter Sloly has called the demonstrators “unlawful” and stressed there will be consequences for their behaviour, with arrests made and more coming. He called the demonstration ""unique and unprecedented"" and said that they are considering asking for help from the Canadian Armed Forces. However, many on Twitter are targeting Ottawa’s police for not doing enough, and are advocating for them to be defunded. Since the weekend, Ottawa downtown core has been inaccessible, with residents being subjected to non-stop honking. Monuments have been desecrated and there have been posts on social media of demonstrators carrying flags associated with fascism and white supremacy, like Swastikas and confederate flags. Some shelters in the area have released statements to speak out about the impact the protests have had on volunteers and people experiencing homelessness. Some users online have pointed out that protests led by Indigenous or Black demonstrators are treated much differently than how the convoy is being dealt with so far.

2/5/2022,"It was a reasonable question. On Thursday, State Department spokesman Ned Price went before reporters and announced the United States has evidence that Russia was planning a ""false flag"" attack by Ukrainians to justify an invasion of Ukraine. Associated Press writer Matt Lee asked the obvious, necessary follow-up question: What's your evidence for that? Things got testy. ""If you doubt the credibility of the U.S. government, of the British government, of other governments and want to, you know, find solace in information that the Russians are putting out, that is for you to do,"" Price ultimately said, after a tense back-and-forth. It was a non-responsive answer — and smacked more than a little bit of McCarthy Era red-baiting. You don't trust what we're saying? Maybe you believe the bad guys, huh? But this kind of thing is becoming routine in the Biden Administration. Also on Thursday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki pushed back on a question about civilian casualties in the U.S. raid that killed ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi. The U.S. alleged al-Qurayashi had detonated a bomb that killed the innocents; a reporter again pressed for evidence of the claim. ""And ISIS is providing accurate information?"" Psaki shot back. This came a few days after she accused Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) of parroting ""Russian talking points"" by opposing NATO membership for Ukraine. Let's be clear: When it comes to matters of war and rumors of war, the U.S. government has very little credibility. The tidal wave of misinformation that led to the Iraq War is the most obvious modern example, but it's far from the only one. Just last fall, military leaders called a Kabul drone strike a ""righteous"" attack on a terrorist — only to later concede a family of 10 had been killed. Former President Donald Trump's rationale for the assassination of an Iranian leader in 2020 ended up looking pretty flimsy, too. This kind of thing happens all the time. No matter which party is running the government, U.S. officials don't get to use the ""trust us"" arguments on matters of life and death, ever. It's also an old, ugly tactic to suggest reporters' sympathies and trust might be more aligned with America's rivals and enemies — a trick that's a step removed, at best, from Trump's much-decried attacks on journalists as ""enemies of the people."" It's easy to lob accusations at critics and questioners rather than answer uncomfortable queries, and it's not better or more defensible when a Democratic administration does it. Even in the best of times, politicians and governments will have prickly relationships with the media. That's fine, and even desirable. But red-baiting from high officials is never acceptable.

Lorena Monroe Cesarini, 34, read some of the messages to the audience during Wednesday night's broadcast of the festival on RAI state television. “They invited you because you are Black,” read one message that said she did not deserve to be there. She quoted another one that read: “Maybe they called you to wash the staircase or water the plants.” Cesarini said it was the first time she had been the target of racism growing up in Italy, and that the messages started as soon as it was reported that she would be a guest of the festival. “Evidently for someone, the color of my skin is a problem,’’ said the actress best known for her role in the Italian serial drama “Suburra."" Cesarini, who was born in Dakar, Senegal, to a Senegalese mother and Italian father, received shouts of support from the live audience, including one who yelled, “You’re Italian,” to which she responded, “Yes, and proud.” She told the audience that she remained perplexed by the messages: “Why do people feel the necessity to write such things on social media? Why do people have a problem with the color of my skin?” Incidents of racism in Italy have drawn more attention in recent years. Both public and private Italian TV have come under fire for the persistent use of racist language and imagery, and the failure to generally represent second-generation Italians of African or Asian descent as integral to society. Black Italian designers have also been pushing for more representation in the fashion world. “Lorena and her monologue are the reason we are doing the work we are doing,’’ said Michele Ngonmo, the head of Afro Fashion Week Milan who has been helping develop a database of Black creatives working in Italy and promoting young designers of color.

2/5/2022,"A lone US hacker is claiming responsibility for crippling North Korea's internet in recent weeks. The hacker was bent on revenge after being targeted by a North Korean cyberattack, Wired reported. Some experts have said the outages may have been caused a distributed denial-of-service attack. North Korea disappeared from the internet at least twice in the past month, with state-run websites becoming inaccessible in what some observers speculated was a distributed denial-of-service attack on the country's servers. In a report published Tuesday, a lone hacker bent on revenge told Wired that he was responsible for crippling the secretive country's internet. The American hacker — who goes by the handle P4x — told Wired he was one of the victims of a cyberattack last year on Western security researchers carried out by North Korean spies. He said he was frustrated that he was a target and that the US appeared to have a lacking response. He said the hackers tried to snatch hacking tools and information on software vulnerabilities but he was able to stop them before they could get anything worthwhile. Nonetheless, there was a feeling of resentment, he told Wired. North Korea fired a ballistic missile from a train for the first time in September. The country plans to expand its railway-borne missile system, which could make it harder for enemies to track and destroy weapons in advance. ""It felt like the right thing to do here,"" P4x told Wired, adding: ""If they don't see we have teeth, it's just going to keep coming. ""I want them to understand that if you come at us, it means some of your infrastructure is going down for a while."" North Korea's mysterious internet outages appeared around the same time the country was conducting record-breaking illegal weapons testing as it fired missile after missile. The timing of these developments led some expert observers to suspect that a state actor, such as the US, might be targeting North Korea, but P4x said that was not the case. Wired reported that P4x provided screen recordings demonstrating his responsibility for the attacks on North Korea's web servers. Insider has not reviewed these. While the hacker was open about claiming responsibility for the attacks, P4x declined to disclose the vulnerabilities in the North Korean system he said he found and exploited to single-handedly take down the entire country's internet on multiple occasions. He did say the attack was largely automated. He told Wired it was ""pretty interesting how easy it was to actually have some effect in there."" P4x also told Wired he was trying to recruit more ""hacktivists"" to join a dark website he launched earlier this week called the FUNK project — which stands for FU North Korea. ""You can make a difference as one person,"" the FUNK website reads, according to the report from Wired.

Some products in our articles are from partners who may provide us with compensation, but this doesn’t change our opinions. If you are not already one of the 200 million Primer members, you may want to join sooner than later to avoid paying 17% more for Amazon Prime in 2022. But act fast: On February 18th, new members to Prime will have to pay $139 to join which is a price jump of $20 more than the current $119 annual membership. Current Prime members will be billed at the higher $139 per year rate after March 25th on their payment renewal date. In addition, Amazon is also raising the price for its month-month which will increase by $2 per month to $14.99 per month, up from the current $12.99 per month price. At $14.99 per month, after March 2022, the new monthly rate works out to $179.88 making the new higher annual membership cost of $139 (which is paid in one lump sum annually) a savings of $40.88. One of our savvy Slickdealers shared this tip on keeping your membership at $119 a year for at least a few more years: Give yourself “the gift of prime” and you can purchase a couple of years worth right now for $119. Buy Amazon Prime for Just $119 (before March 25, 2022) You can then apply your purchases each year to stay a member of Prime at the same $119 price well after the $20 price hike takes effect. For example, if your Prime membership expires this year on May 19th, you need to turn off your Prime auto-renewal and on March 19th or 20th, click on the email that was sent after your purchase to activate a new subscription. Do It Again: Then, do the same thing again next year. While this Slick Tip and hack only saves $20, that can add up to $60 or more over a few years. The past rumor of a 2022 price increase for Prime members came directly from a New York Times article that reported on the financial analysts tasked with following Amazon. According to these experts, 2022 will be the year customers in the United States see a new price for Prime with specifics of an exact date and new higher annual fee are currently unknown at the time. But, today we know the increase is confirmed and will start as soon as February 18 for people joining Prime for the first time. Amazon Prime is one of the few services that doesn’t see membership numbers plummet when membership fees go up. In fact, the analysts mention that many Americans can’t see themselves without Prime regardless of its price tag. Even stranger is the notion that some people increase their use of Amazon as yearly fees increase, likely as a way to justify its higher cost. There’s also the question of viable alternative services. Amazon has seen tremendous growth over the past decade, and few competitors can match the scale, availability and shipping speed offered by Prime. While Amazon has decided to go ahead with another bump up its pricing again for 2022, there are still comparable platforms that offer the same (or similar) perks such as Target and Walmart to name a few that can offer similar services for those looking to finally opt-out of Amazon due to the new higher rate. Amazon Prime has become an integral part of most consumers’ shopping habits, and minor price adjustments haven’t seemed to impact subscription numbers. However, it does seem that some folks have a tipping point. A recent active discussion started on our own Slickdeals Twitter account where we asked “At what price would you cancel your Prime Membership?” The ask elicited almost 200 comments and it seems $150 for Prime is the magic number at which people will quit their Prime service for good. Others in the chat mentioned they had already unsubscribed after the price increase of 2018, noting the service no longer provided enough value for them to justify its cost. On the other end of the spectrum are the avid Prime users, who won’t cancel their subscription unless it topped $200/year. The convenience and speed of shopping with Amazon Prime are more than worth the annual subscription fee to these members. And if you’re JPMorgan (whose professional financial analysts calculated the value of all Prime services and tallied them up), people wouldn’t stop paying until the annual fee topped $785. Price increases are nothing new in the world of subscriptions, and Amazon itself has often found reason to hike its rates. Those reasons often tend to arrive every four years –and in 2022, according to analysts who follow and track Amazon’s business, there is not a single reason standout for the price hike, and higher costs from on everything from shipping and labor to construction are behind the Spring 2022 price hike for Prime. Here’s a quick look back at most recent Amazon Prime price increases, how much and when they happened: February 2022: Prime membership jumps another $20 to $139/year. June 2018: Rates jumped another $20 to its current $119/year cost. March 2014: Membership jumped $20 from $79/year to $99/year. February 2005: Amazon Prime debuts and announced for $79/year. Looking at all of these prices increases, this means joining Prime is now $60 more expensive that is debut at $79 in 2005. Price increases in the past were accompanied by an announcement that rises in costs such as higher rates for shipping and fuel as the main culprit for the new fees. Amazon had also been adding new perks to Prime subscriptions including an enhanced selection of digital content when it launched Amazon Studios (in 2010) which justified their past increases as well. It’s also worth calling out Amazon Prime now offers more than just free and fast 2-day shipping. Prime may have started as a simple e-commerce service, but today it offers these current services and access under Prime: Free same-day shipping, when available Free access to Prime Video catalog Monthly perks for today’s hottest video games Amazon Photos online storage Prime Reading catalog Exclusive deals at Whole Foods Market Access to Prime Day savings Early access to Lightning Deals “Try Before You Buy” option that lets you try out items and only pay for what you keep Free access to streaming music catalog Alexa-enabled easy shopping and delivery notifications This is not even every perk. To many, Amazon Prime isn’t just for shopping – it’s also a primary source of entertainment, allowing them to forgo other monthly fees such as Spotify or Netflix. When you factor in those perks, it’s easy to see why some members are willing to put up with any annual price changes. Technically and legally, anyone can get free shipping from Amazon with a minimum purchase of $25. While it may take a little more time and effort to coordinate your purchases and wait until you have enough to make the $25 minimum, it will give you the benefits of free shipping without the $119 annual cost. Walking away from Amazon Prime can also help people save by helping them avoid all those impulse purchases (of $24 or less) that can arrive as soon as just a few hours, the same or the next day (and without ever leaving home). While this means fewer dopamine hits from instant gratification (it’s Christmas all year) from placing and receiving an order so seamlessly, there could be the benefit of saving hundreds as a result. However, with Amazon Studios currently acting as a true and successful studio in the original programming and movie industry, the success of the studio and the popularity of its offering could be another reason for Amazon to justify its next price hike –and keep people hooked. If you have binged on any of these popular and acclaimed titles below (just a sampling of what came out of Amazon Studios), then any extra hike in prices is probably worth it to major media fans and cord-cutters: Popular Shows from Amazon Studios The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel The Boys Fleabag Bosch Vikings The Wheel of Time Considering we’re now four years out from the last price hike, it seems another one is just around the bend. And if past trends are anything to go by, we can expect to see an annual fee of $139 announced during spring. Amazon Prime might seem like an incredible deal at $119/year, but are you really getting your money’s worth? And at what price would it stop being beneficial to your wallet? While the above perks make it a bit subjective, there’s an easy way to see how much you’re spending (and saving) with Amazon Prime every year. While not the easiest to find on your dashboard, you can use the button and links below to navigate to a page that will allow you run (and export) a very detailed view of what you ordered, how much was each order value and what time and day you ordered. Create an Amazon Order Report Click on the button above or this link. Log in to your account on Amazon. Select the time frame you want to see. Name your report. Select “Request Report” You can also download and export your report to a spreadsheet to analyze your spending in detail. This process will download a spreadsheet with all your purchases for the selected timeframe. While this will give you an exact number for how much you’re spending, determining how much you’re saving in shipping with Amazon Prime is a bit more nebulous. To do this, you’ll need to find all orders under $25.00, as even non-Prime members can qualify for free shipping on most purchases over this threshold. Next, you’ll need to multiple this number by the approximate cost of shipping. Costs of shipping can vary wildly from product to product, with the average cost when ordering from third-party sellers being higher on average than Prime-eligible items. Prime eligible products are closer to $5 in shipping for non-members. So, if you’ve placed 10 Prime-eligible orders under $25.00 within the past year, you’ve may have saved around $50 in shipping fees. Now subtract the yearly Prime fee ($119, using the current rate), and your cost to have a Prime membership that gives you access to all Amazon perks outside of free shipping comes out to $69 per year (an average of $5.75 per month). It’s not a perfect methodology, but Amazon doesn’t give you an easy way to track shipping fees on your orders. If you’re looking for a more accurate number, consider tracking all your would-be shipping fees throughout 2022. If that number ends up larger than your yearly fee, then Prime is a solid investment.

2/5/2022,"By Andrew Osborn and Mark Trevelyan MOSCOW (Reuters) - China and Russia proclaimed a deep strategic partnership on Friday to balance what they portrayed as the malign global influence of the United States as China's President Xi Jinping hosted Russia's Vladimir Putin on the opening day of the Beijing Winter Olympics. In a joint statement, the two countries affirmed that their new relationship was superior to any political or military alliance of the Cold War era. ""Friendship between the two States has no limits, there are no 'forbidden' areas of cooperation,"" they declared, announcing plans to collaborate in a host of areas including space, climate change, artificial intelligence and control of the internet. The agreement marked the most detailed and assertive statement of Russian and Chinese resolve to work together - and against the United States - to build a new international order based on their own interpretations of human rights and democracy. The statement was steeped in ideological discourse and it was not clear whether it would immediately translate into an increase in tangible and practical cooperation - although Putin trumpeted a new gas deal with China on Friday - or was intended as more of a statement of general policy intent. The United States responded coolly. Asked about the meeting between Xi and Putin, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden has his own relationship with China. Referring to a massing of Russian troops near the Ukraine border, she said the U.S. focus is currently on working with partners in case Russia invades Ukraine, adding ""we've also conveyed that destabilizing conflict in Europe would impact China's interests all over the world."" Daniel Russel of the Asia Society think tank, who served as the U.S. State Department's top diplomat for East Asia in the Obama administration, said Xi and Putin were ""announcing their determination to stand together and to stand against the U.S. and the West — ready to withstand sanctions and contest American global leadership"". While not formally allied, the two ""are making common cause as a tactical matter to better defend their respective interests and their authoritarian systems from Western pressure"", he said. Jonathan Eyal of the London-based Royal United Services Institute said the declaration marked a ""frontal rebuttal"" of the U.S. and Western view of the world and a possible building block towards a military alliance. ""They both feel cornered and they feel their moment has arrived to state their vision of the world and promote it aggressively."" MUTUAL SUPPORT The two countries have moved closer together as both have come under pressure from the West on issues including their human rights records and Russia's military build-up near Ukraine. The timing of their announcement was highly symbolic, at a China-hosted that the United States has subjected to a diplomatic boycott. In the lengthy document - nearly 5,400 words in English translation - each went significantly further than before in backing the other on flashpoints of tension with the West. - Russia voiced its support for China's stance that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and opposition to any form of independence for the island. Moscow and Beijing also voiced their opposition to the AUKUS alliance between Australia, Britain and the United States, saying it increased the danger of an arms race in the region. - China joined Russia in calling for an end to NATO enlargement and supported its demand for security guarantees from the West - issues at the heart of Moscow's confrontation with the United States and its allies over Ukraine. The two countries expressed concern about ""the advancement of U.S. plans to develop global missile defence and deploy its elements in various regions of the world, combined with capacity building of high-precision non-nuclear weapons for disarming strikes and other strategic objectives"". Elsewhere, without naming Washington, they criticised attempts by ""certain states"" to establish global hegemony, fan confrontation and impose their own standards of democracy. Scott Kennedy, a China expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that despite the rhetoric, there would be limits to the alliance. ""China is willing to stand with Russia through thin but not thick. This collaboration works as long as it entails few costs. They are expanding their commercial ties, extolling a similar anti-American/pro-authoritarian narrative, and hoping their friendship weakens the West’s military position in Europe and Asia,"" he said, adding, ""If a war breaks out over Ukraine or Taiwan, we can expect this partnership to fracture."" TECH AND ENERGY In the technology arena, Russia and China said they were ready to strengthen cooperation on artificial intelligence and information security. They said they believed that ""any attempts to limit their sovereign right to regulate national segments of the Internet and ensure their security are unacceptable"". Meanwhile Russian state energy giants Gazprom and Rosneft on Friday agreed new gas and oil supply deals with Beijing worth tens of billions of dollars. The deals capitalise on Putin's drive to diversify Russian energy exports away from the West, which started shortly after he came to power in 1999. Since then Russia has become China's top energy supplier and cut its reliance on the West for revenues. The Kremlin said the presidents also discussed the need to broaden trade in national currencies because of unpredictability surrounding the use of the dollar. U.S. President Joe Biden has said Russian companies could be cut off from the ability to trade in dollars as part of sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine. Moscow denies any such intention, but has used a build-up of more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's border to grab the attention of the West and press its demands for security guarantees.
