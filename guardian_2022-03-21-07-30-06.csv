3/21/2022,"For the second successive Test match it was England making all the running on the final day, throwing everything they could muster at West Indies in Bridgetown only to once again find themselves shaking hands on a draw after another defiant vigil from Kraigg Brathwaite. West Indies had been set a target of 282 for victory from a minimum of 65 overs after England had thrashed their way to 185 for six at lunch and a second declaration in the match. The equation was not dissimilar to that witnessed in Antigua last week when the hosts needed 286 from 71 overs, so, too, their early switch to survival mode after the loss of three quick wickets. But come 5.47pm local time the hosts had forced their guests to settle for a 0-0 scoreline going into Thursday’s third Test in Grenada. Brathwaite was simply the hardiest of perennials for England’s bowlers in this match, following his epic 11-hour first innings score of 160 with a further 246 minutes at the crease for an unbeaten 56. Jack Leach claimed three wickets, Saqib Mahmood two, but neither the West Indies captain, nor Joshua Da Silva at the other end on 30, could be dislodged. “Pressure does funny things,” had been Mahmood’s upbeat outlook on the fourth evening, knowing the challenge in front of England’s bowlers would be a stiff one on a surface that had been heartbreaking. After Joe Root called time on the third innings at lunch, the debutant did his best to induce plenty, delivering a searing six-over burst that underlined the 25-year-old’s potential. It was Leach who struck initially for England when he was tossed a hard new ball by Root just five overs in and instantly removed opener John Campbell via a bat-pad catch that needed the latest use of the review system in a series of poor umpiring. The lock picked, Mahmood then raised hopes of a stirring finale with the removals of Shamarh Brooks and Nkrumah Bonner. Gliding in from the Joel Garner End before winding up into his smooth but slingy action, Mahmood struck with his sixth ball when Brooks edged the first catch to the cordon all the match. Root was credited in the scorebook – his 150th catch in Test cricket – but it was Zak Crawley at second slip who made it possible, twice palming the ball upwards before his captain ran round. Root’s 151st was far simpler, at least, Mahmood smashing the ball into the pitch to extract the merest hint of seam away that squared up Bonner and took the edge. From 38 for three in just the 12th over West Indies managed to get through to tea, first innings centurion Jermaine Blackwood joining his captain for an hour and a half of steadfast resistance. West Indies sitting three down going into the final session was another repeat scenario from the first Test but Leach swiftly changed the narrative after a change of ends, breaking 24 overs of resistance when he floated one up to Blackwood, found a smidgeon of turn and Jonny Bairstow – one of two close fielders kneeling down in the cage of catchers – snaffled it. After Jason Holder soon fell for a 24-ball duck, trying to carve one through cover only to fall victim to an excellent diving catch from Dan Lawrence, West Indies went into the final hour five down. The tension was high, the crowd was being rewarded for the patience shown all match and no one could argue that England’s desire to take the contest deep this time was disrespectful. The launchpad for England’s victory push had come in the morning when, in between showers and the now familiar sight of the local sound engineer racing on to rescue his stump microphones, they crashed 145 runs in just shy of 25 overs. Their batters cared little for red ink, losing six wickets along the way as the West Indies outfielders held a succession of superb catches in the deep. Lawrence top scored with 41 from 39 balls, the wristy No 4 repeating his role on the final day in Antigua and completing a strong overall performance following his enterprising 91 on the opening day. He and Jonny Bairstow cleared the ropes a couple of times apiece to the delight of the crowd, while all eight batters were wing-heeled between the wickets with the field spread. This was the first freewheeling session witnessed by the travelling supporters since Ben Stokes lit up the second day with his 128-ball 120, making way for a commendable assault on the West Indies lineup despite two of their frontline bowlers – Chris Woakes and Matthew Fisher – left redundant by conditions. On the rebuild in the Caribbean, England are putting much stock in qualities such as energy and selflessness. Hopes of a first victory of the winter may have disappeared in the gloaming but on these fronts they are meeting the brief.",Sport/Sport,England frustrated by Kraigg Brathwaite again as second Test ends in draw,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/20/england-frustrated-by-kraigg-brathwaite-again-as-second-test-ends-in-draw
3/21/2022,"“I have good memories of playing at the Bernabéu,” Xavi Hernández had said and here was another one for the collection. It may even have given him even more satisfaction than all those other nights, his first visit as Barcelona’s coach, the man entrusted with their revival, seeing his side end a run of five consecutive clásico defeats with an astonishing 4-0 victory at the home of their greatest rivals. Two goals from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and one each from Ronald Araújo and Ferran Torres completed the scoring but not the story. If Xavi had fondly recalled clásicos past where Barcelona “played good football and won, where we felt like we were better than them,” this was much the same, suggesting a seismic shift for his club. With Madrid still 12 points ahead of Barcelona, it is too late for this season – and that fact may have played its part – but maybe not for next year and beyond. After five consecutive clásico defeats, Barcelona produced a performance that suggests they really might be back, enjoying watching this arena emptying early again. It had all been done early, finished before the hour, effectively done before the break. By the end, the only surprise was that the margin wasn’t even greater. It wouldn’t have been unjust. So dominant had Barcelona become by the end of the first half that when the teams walked off the place was almost silent, apart from a chant of “Futbol Club Barcelona” from high in the north-east corner. The 300 or so Barcelona fans up there had been audible for a while, mostly only competing with whistles of frustration from the home fans as time went on. There had been a serenade of Xavi and even “olés” as their team moved the ball around the pitch, no longer in a hurry. Barcelona had a 2-0 lead, and almost complete control, Araújo heading in the second not long before the break. The Uruguayan had been included as a means of protection, Xavi concerned enough about Vinícius to include him at full-back instead of Dani Alves – left out of a league game for the first time since his arrival. Stronger, taller, faster, Araújo was tested after just four minutes when Vinícius was sent dashing up the left to set up Fede Valverde for the first shot of the night, arriving in the area to hit a side-footer low towards the far post, where it was pushed away by Marc-André Ter Stegen. If that was a warning, an even better chance and save followed almost immediately at the other end. Ferran Torres was released up the left by Sergio Busquets. His delivery found Aubameyang inside the six-yard box, sweeping at the ball first time. The contact wasn’t clean and Courtois failed to stop it, De Jong collecting the loose ball and giving it to Dembélé. Again, Courtois was there. Every week there is at least one superb moment from the man with a strong claim to be not just La Liga’s best goalkeeper but its best player; most weeks there are significantly more than that. Again he saved when Aubameyang was slipped into the area by Frenkie de Jong. And nor was that chance the only thing that would have concerned Carlo Ancelotti, his initial plan broken. The absence of Karim Benzema had seen Luka Modric deployed in what could almost be described as a false 9 role behind Vinícius and Rodrygo. If it had been designed to give them more control in the middle, it didn’t really work, Barcelona soon in control. Torres had bent a shot just past the far post. Glorious footwork and a scooped ball from Pedri had given Torres a second chance before Casemiro slid in to block. And then, just before the half hour, Aubameyang headed in Dembélé’s superb cross for his sixth league goal since joining from Arsenal. There was a reminder of Madrid’s threat when they suddenly broke from a corner, Pedri desperately grabbing at Modric’s shirt but unable to prevent the pass that sent Vinicius away. But, faced by Ter Stegen, he fell over the ball and Barcelona soon reimposed themselves. Dembélé turned Nacho and fired off a shot that was blocked. Nacho, like Dani Carvajal on the other side, really was not enjoying this. And when Araújo leapt between David Alaba and Militão to score, this felt over already. Soon, it really was. The second half was only 30 seconds in when Torres was clean through one on one with Courtois. He bent that shot past the post but quickly got another, Barcelona slicing Madrid open. De Jong and Dembélé combined, Aubameyang provided a lovely flick and Torres produced almost the same finish as he had two minutes earlier, except this one went inside the post. Five minutes later it was Aubameyang’s turn, Torres turning Piqué’s long pass into the Gabon striker, who lifted it coolly over the keeper and into the net. Initially ruled out for outside, a long wait for the VAR eventually delivered Barcelona’s fourth, sending subs and staff sprinting on to the pitch in celebration. This was quite something to see, and a manita – a little hand, one goal for each finger – might have followed fast, as might a hat-trick, Aubameyang somehow steering Jordi Alba’s pass wide from close range. It could have arrived when Courtois pushed away another shot from Torres, Madrid finished off well ahead of time. It could have arrived when Dembélé shot wide from six yards too, and when Memphis Depay was denied by Courtois. Four would have to do. It’s certainly a start, Xavi the coach inviting a new generation to feel the way he had.",Sport/Football,Aubameyang leads way for Barcelona with two goals in Real Madrid thrashing,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/20/real-madrid-barcelona-el-clasico-la-liga-match-report
3/21/2022,"It is a damning indictment of England’s inability to find their attacking stride throughout this Six Nations that one of the players who emerges in credit never took to the field. For, in a strange way, this has been a good tournament for Owen Farrell. Certainly Manu Tuilagi’s importance to England has been magnified by his absence, their reliance on him laid bare, but Farrell’s return to the fold is likely at the first available opportunity given the problems Eddie Jones’s side have encountered. It was a similar story against France. Ellis Genge’s running from deep and Freddie Steward’s aerial prowess were strong points but from early on in the contest it was apparent England were swimming against the tide. Steward managed to finish off a period of pressure for England’s eighth try of the tournament – or third in matches not including Italy – and one of those, against Wales, should arguably not have counted. Had England’s attack clicked into gear, produced anything like the kind of rhythm to match the rhetoric coming from Jones and his assistants, the avenues back into the side for Farrell would have seemed fewer. Ben Youngs’s choice of word to describe how the attack has gone in practice – “clunky” – can often be an apt way of describing Farrell’s performances when he is out of form but you sense Jones will waste little time in turning to the Saracen on the tour of Australia this summer. He is not everyone’s cup of tea and whether he is given back the captaincy is a debate for another day but Jones would expect his return to bring clarity because there were several occasions on Saturday night when England players were almost caricatures of cluelessness. Certainly, French pressure and the intensity of the atmosphere played their part but there were times when Youngs, Marcus Smith and Henry Slade seemed overcome by confusion, overwhelmed by indecision. “The improvement in our attack has been very good, the only thing we have not been able to do is to finish,” Jones said in one of his more obvious contradictions. Suffice to say, England’s free, fluid formation has not been mastered. To again sum up the muddled thinking, Genge once more emptied himself but was as a result exhausted and came off second best at the scrum – an area of total English dominance the previous week against Ireland. To further illustrate, just look at how Jones used George Ford, the best kicking fly-half in England by a significant distance, throughout the tournament. Saturday was Smith’s least effective performance in an England jersey. He was evidently instructed to hoist the ball high for Steward to chase and still managed to create a few openings, though there were errors too, as seen with an overcooked cross-field kick for Jamie George. Having hooked Smith early against Scotland, however, Jones was not prepared to do so again when Ford’s kicking, not to mention his familiarity with Steward and Youngs, would have been welcome. Indeed, if Jones was willing to sacrifice Harry Randall’s development temporarily in the interests of pragmatism with a recall for Youngs, why did the head coach not follow through and make a similar decision at fly-half? It seems odd to be criticising England for not playing with enough structure but to return to the free formation that Jones insists is not far away from clicking, there must now be considerable scepticism it ever will. For all that it sounds bold, like the kind of thing supporters want to hear, there is something delusional about it. A bit like trying to recreate the Sistine Chapel before mastering the art of painting by numbers first.“There’s no doubt that at times it hasn’t been as fluid as we’d have liked, it’s been a little clunky,” Youngs said. “Attack is the hardest part of the game – there are so many moving parts, different things. We’ve had a number of different combinations. It needs to be fluid and we haven’t had that. If I were to sum it up I would say that at times it’s been a little bit clunky.” It should also be noted that Warren Gatland had similarly grand designs with Wales before the penny dropped that his players needed structure and instruction from the coaches. There have been times during Jones’s reign that he has appeared to have reached a similar conclusion and even taking into consideration his insistence that the game is changing for the quicker, you have to wonder why he has decided to chase the rainbow now. Equally, you wonder whether it is entirely coincidence that perhaps the player most comfortable with the fluidity Jones seeks is Joe Marchant, the only member of the squad to have played Super Rugby, a brief spell on loan in Auckland. Simon Amor was the fall guy 12 months ago and it remains to be seen whether his replacement as attack coach, Martin Gleeson, suffers a similar fate considering England’s failure to cross the tryline regularly. Judging by the Rugby Football Union’s endorsement of Jones’s projecton Sunday, that seems unlikely. But when the head coach urges fans to have faith, it feels like a big request. Patience is wearing thin, promises of progress increasingly ring hollow and nowhere is that as evident as with England’s attack.",Sport/Sport,Ben Youngs calling attack ‘clunky’ exposes England’s problem | Gerard Meagher,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/20/ben-youngs-calling-attack-clunky-exposes-englands-problem
3/21/2022,"A shock diagnosis, a secret son and a reluctant salute. Here’s your full medical examination of episode four, Sapphire … “I understand you have defeated many enemies, Mr Shelby. Now you have a new one inside you. You cannot defeat it – but you can keep it at bay for a while.” Oh, Tommy. It was a Shakespearean inevitability that our death-dodging antihero would ultimately prove to be his own worst foe. Kudos to commenters who called Tommy’s brain tumour two weeks ago. All episode, he’d been ignoring ominous letters and urgent calls from the hospital. Tommy (Cillian Murphy) could hide no longer when he received a house call from Dr Holford (Aneurin Barnard) and got his devastating news. X-rays showed a shadow at the base of his skull. He had tuberculoma in his brain stem, a growth caused by the same bacteria as the lung disease, doubtless picked up from daughter Ruby (Orla McDonagh). It wasn’t infectious but it was inoperable. The symptoms (seizures, dissociation, hallucinations, sharp cheekbones – I may have added the last one) chimed with Tommy’s. As the tumour grew, his deterioration would accelerate. When Lizzie (Natasha O’Keeffe, again on excellent form) interrupted, it was agonising how Tommy hastily pretended that Holford was his accountant and coded the end of their conversation in financial terms. How long did he have before he’d need round-the-clock care? A year to 18 months. Long enough to get him through the two remaining episodes of this series, but what about the confirmed film sequel? Barring medical miracles, bang go theories that it will leapfrog forward five years to the second world war – unless it’s without Tommy. We left him talking to the spirit of Aunt Polly (Helen McCrory): “I’m not a devil, just an ordinary mortal man … Just give me enough time to do what I have to do.” A terminally ill man committing crimes to ensure his family’s financial security after his death? Welcome to the Brummie Breaking Bad. A sombre opening sequence saw Charlie Strong (Ned Dennehy) open his salvage yard gates for Ruby’s funeral. With its boats and horses, it was the seven-year-old’s favourite place to play. The sight of a child-sized coffin made it all the more poignant. With visual echoes of episode one’s send-off for Polly, the 10-minute scene was beautifully shot by director Anthony Byrne – all bluey-grey filters and eerie morning mist, every frame like a painting. An emotional Tommy asked big bruv Arthur (Paul Anderson) to read the eulogy but he was too bowed and broken. Perhaps no bad thing. Remember series three’s disastrous best man’s speech? “The devils who did this will pay, Ruby,” vowed her father, striding away from his distraught wife, Lizzie (Natasha O’Keeffe, excellent again) on a revenge mission. Cut to him striding into a woodland Gypsy camp, declaring that he was there on behalf of the blue sapphire before coldly gunning down Evadne Barwell (Gwynne McElveen), along with three male campmates. It was Barwell who’d put a hex on Ruby in revenge for the cursed Russian gem killing her own daughter. Would payback make Tommy feel better? Not really. He smashed his rifle against a tree and fell tearfully to his knees. His hitman act hardly endeared him to Lizzie, either. Despite Tommy’s promises about becoming a better man, he dealt with grief by throwing himself into work and firing guns in fury. His horse, Grace’s Secret, provided poor Lizzie with more comfort. It was sister-in-law Esme Shelby-Lee (Aimee-Ffion Edwards) who tracked down the wild Barwell tribe on Tommy’s behalf. When he delivered Esme’s payment, she dropped another bombshell. Tommy slept with a girl called Zelda in May 1914, two months before he left for the Great War, and fathered a son he never knew he had: the nobly named Duke, now in his late teens and a thief (attaboy) who works at fairgrounds. No fairytale reunion here. Tommy was in no fit state and ain’t that type of guy. But we can expect light-fingered Duke Shelby to play a bigger part over the next fortnight. He wants more from life than big wheels and carousels. He could be about to get it. Last week saw power-brokers invited to Tommy’s house to discuss the new world order. Despite it being four days since Ruby’s death, this secret summit went ahead. Oswald Mosley (Sam Claflin) and Diana Mitford (Amber Anderson) were first down the driveway, followed by IRA leader Laura McKee (Charlene McKenna) and finally cigar-puffing Boston mob boss Jack Nelson (James Frecheville). While they waited for Tommy, Diana Mitford boasted about attending a similar gathering in Berlin with Göring, Himmler and Hitler himself – after which the entertainment was to watch Jews being humiliatingly force-fed grass. Despicable Di’s comeuppance can’t arrive quick enough. When Tommy emerged, Mitford made eyes at him once again. The message for Uncle Jack Nelson to relay to President Roosevelt was that Mosley could be a bulwark against communist insurgency. England was on the brink of fascism. McKee said working-class Irish republicans only needed a nudge to turn the same way. But did Labour MP Tommy truly believe in “the cause”? Face like thunder and the words sticking in his throat, he joined Mosley in a “Perish Judah” salute to prove his commitment. Chilling, even in a drama set 90 years ago. It did the trick. Nelson declared Boston open for the export of weapons to the IRA and the import of Tommy’s drugs. The shadowy meeting, with its sidelong looks and spinning cameras, was adjourned. In Westminster, the phone was ringing off the hook. Tommy had spies at the flat that Mosley uses to conduct affairs and they came up trumps. Mosley was enthusiastically in flagrante with Michael’s wife, Gina, (Anya Taylor-Joy). So much for her talk of trust and fidelity. Once Mosley left, Tommy barged in to let Gina know he now had leverage. In return for not telling Jack or Michael, Tommy ordered Gina to be his spy in Berlin when Mosley met senior members of the German government. When he asked Michael’s true intentions towards him, Gina lied that her husband was strictly about the Boston deal. Tommy smiled. Yeah, right. Relieved of stand-in boss duties, sister Ada (Sophie Rundle) was putting daughter Elizabeth to bed when a racist threat came through the window, tied to a brick. She fearlessly confronted fascist thugs outside her Mayfair home, dispersing them with a knee to the groin and the wave of her gun. Safely back inside, she was shocked to realise that teen son Karl (Callum Booth-Ford) was a trainee racist, too. He sneered that his mixed-race baby sister – fathered by Col Ben Younger (Kingsley Ben-Adir) last series before he was blown up in a car bomb – would “get them killed” and be “sent back to Africa”. Ada gave him pleasingly short shrift, reminding Karl that he had Gypsy blood. What’s more, he was half-Jewish. His late father, Freddie Thorne (played by Israel-born actor Iddo Goldberg in series one), was the son of a Jewish tailor who’d westernised his surname. A sobering illustration of the pernicious rise of far-right radicalisation and the lazy ignorance of bigots. Down in Tommy’s cellar, alone in the dark, was Arthur, still struggling with opium withdrawal. When Tommy went down to join his brother-in-arms, it was as if they were tunnellers beneath no man’s land again. The nostalgic mood continued as they exchanged childhood reminiscences, albeit mainly about fighting. The sweet scene between the siblings momentarily looked like it might ease both their troubles. “You’ll change your ways and I’ll change the fucking world,” said Tommy, shaking hands and falling off the wagon with a swig of red wine to seal the deal. Hopes for a clean and serene Arthur renaissance proved equally in vain. He was soon tearing apart Chinatown opium dens, which had been ordered not to sell to him any more, before slumping in an alley with fistfuls of junk. Come back to us, Arthur. Tommy needs you. Viewers need you. Plenty of serious stuff this episode, but there was some welcome light relief. When monstrous Mitford horrified fellow guests with that grim anecdote, Mosley snorted with mirth and indulgently replied: “Oh Diana, you’ve killed the mood.” You can say that again. The most musical episode of the series so far began with a pair of plaintive Sinéad O’Connor ballads, In This Heart and Lullaby For Cain. But tune of the week goes to Irish folk singer Lisa O’Neill’s Blackbird, which segued hauntingly out of Charlene McKenna’s rendition of The Black Velvet Band. We only glimpsed him fleetingly, but new arrival Duke is played by Conrad Khan, who previously appeared in BBC One stablemate Baptiste. His performance in the 2019 film County Lines earned him a Bafta rising star nomination. Always reassuring to see Frances (Pauline Turner), Tommy’s loyal housekeeper for three series now. If she falls, the Shelbys fall. Doctor-and-patient Aneurin Barnard and Cillian Murphy previously appeared together in Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk.

3/21/2022,"Just occasionally in sport the scoreboard becomes a side issue. For everyone in Paris on Saturday night, particularly those from across the Channel, what will really stick in the mind is the overriding post-match mood of genuine Gallic excitement. As France’s euphoric supporters celebrated their team’s deserved grand slam it was hard not to envisage many more champagne moments ahead. It was also a tantalising amuse bouche for what awaits when France host next year’s World Cup. Gazing into the future is never an exact science but Les Bleus appear to have an impressive number of bases covered. A young team, with rare talents such as Virimi Vakatawa, Charles Ollivon, Matthieu Jalibert and Teddy Thomas striving just to make the wider squad, has the potential to achieve special things and the entire country is uniting proudly behind them. Formidable is one word for it, particularly with their imported guru Shaun Edwards on hand to keep everyone grounded. Did you know Edwards has now won more grand slams over the past 15 years than England, Scotland, Ireland and Italy combined? Which is another uncomfortable fact for the Rugby Football Union’s grandees to reflect upon as they rake over the lukewarm leftovers of another dispiriting campaign under Eddie Jones. To say England are on a road to nowhere with Jones in charge is merely to restate the increasingly obvious. To insist otherwise is to be as stubbornly in denial as Jones himself seems. “I’ve never been as excited about this team,” he insisted on Sunday. “I think we’re in a really positive situation.” The only people still buying this low-grade, self-serving fertiliser seem to be certain high-ranking individuals within the RFU whose own judgment is now under scrutiny. Because, for all Jones’s efforts to deflect England’s shortcomings down to third man and look ahead to this July’s three-Test tour to Australia, the reality is starkly different. Have England noticeably kicked on since losing in Ireland to cement fifth place in last year’s final table? No. In some important areas they have significantly regressed, not least in terms of the confidence they engender among their long-suffering supporters. The online message boards certainly seem to have rounded on the Jones project and with good reason. Is kicking the ball skywards and determinedly running after it really the best that England can muster in his seventh year at the helm? England were beating France at Twickenham last March and hustling South Africa in November. In this Six Nations they have scored their fewest number of tries since 2013. In truth France would have scored 40 points on Saturday night had they not butchered at least three clear try-scoring opportunities. Maybe it was nerves but it looked more like overexcitement. Les Bleus knew they had England on French toast and, a couple of dropped balls notwithstanding, looked significantly the better coached side. Once the great Antoine Dupont had carved through to score his side’s decisive third try after 61 minutes there was not even the slightest hint of France losing. Might a couple of injured Englishmen have helped? Of course. But it is not the players who should be under the spotlight here. How are they meant to produce consistent, cohesive performances when those qualities are so often absent in selection? Why did England drag off Marcus Smith in Scotland when they were ahead? What exactly is English rugby’s identity these days? And is there anyone high up at Twickenham prepared to admit that backing Jones for another World Cup cycle was a fingers-crossed punt that is not working out? As things stand the only areas in which the RFU is currently leading the world are mediocrity and half-baked excuses. Jones seems to have increasingly little empathy with the English public, only a hazy knowledge of talent coming through and a lack of awareness of just how much the Six Nations matters perception-wise. When even Italy emerge from the championship on more of an upward curve than England it really is time to take proper stock. The RFU did not hire the talkative Australian to put the “average” into Dame Edna Everage. The entire edifice badly needs a fresh set of eyes, capable of seeing not just the crescent but the whole of the moon. If the Twickenham hierarchy cannot hire Edwards or Andy Farrell and other longer-term alternatives are unavailable they could do a lot worse than fly in Warren Gatland – Red Adair in a red rose tracksuit – to apply some sage wisdom to their predicament. Gatland already knows many of England’s leading players well from British & Irish Lions tours and, having coached Wasps in their trophy-winning heyday, would not be parachuting into entirely alien territory. It would be a costly reshuffle but what is the alternative? To soldier on with a posturing head coach who has lost the faith of virtually everyone in the English game since the 2019 World Cup semi-final? To sit back and watch France and Ireland grow ever stronger and more united while the boos rain down from the Twickenham stands? Doing nothing no longer feels like a viable option. At this rate even Australia, having regrouped under Dave Rennie, will fancy beating whatever version of “new England” washes up down under this summer. Always assuming Jones is still in place for the Last Night of the Poms. As well as being brilliant for the world game, France’s renaissance may yet require English rugby to remove its head from the sand.",Sport/Sport,Sticking with Eddie Jones will leave others to savour champagne moments | Robert Kitson,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/20/eddie-jones-france-ireland-england-six-nations
3/21/2022,"The authors of the Uluru Statement from the Heart are calling on Australians to make constitutional change an election issue, saying the only chance for reform is if voters, not the government, start to demand it. “Look, forget the government,” said Pat Anderson, a Alyawarre woman who co-chaired the Referendum Council, which designed the process that resulted in the Uluru statement. “They are not going to do it, even the people five years ago … we know that they are not going to do it. That’s why we have to appeal to the Australian people now.” The Uluru statement was delivered on 27 May 2017. It has not been enacted, and even plans to legislate for a non-constitutional voice to parliament have not yet eventuated. The statement arose from a lengthy consultation process culminating in three days of talks at Uluru between First Nations delegates from across the country. They produced a joint statement calling for the right for First Nations people to have a voice to the Australian parliament to be enshrined in the constitution. They also called for a Makarata commission, which would undertake a truth-telling process and begin paving the way for a treaty, or many treaties. Anderson called the statement “a beautiful gift to the Australian people” and said it was never directed at the government of the day. It was hoped that Australians would pick up the mantle of change, as they did in the 1967 referendum, and overwhelmingly vote in support of First Nations people. “There was a really strong fundamental belief in the decency of the Australian people,” Anderson said. The government’s response to the Uluru statement – a swift and continued rejection of requirement that a voice to parliament be enshrined in the constitution – was neither unexpected nor unprecedented. The past 233 years of colonisation, Anderson said, had given First Nations people a lot of experience at rejection. So the statement’s authors are now calling on voters to use their power to try to grow support for the reform. “We didn’t really expect the government to say, ‘We’re gonna do this,’” Anderson said. “But if there’s a people’s movement and a real groundswell of support … If politicians are getting stopped everywhere they go by people who want to talk about the Uluru statement, they’re going to come back to Canberra and see their bosses and say, ‘Listen, I can’t get anywhere in my electorate without somebody wanting to stop me and talk to me about the Uluru Statement from the Heart’ … That’s the people’s movement and it’s real old-fashioned activism. “Write to your local member, write to the prime minister, talk to your local member, and say why you support the Uluru Statement from the Heart.” Supporters of the voice have spent the five years since the statement was handed down lobbying governments and businesses, and travelling around the country with the statement to share it with schools and community groups. They have begun meeting with independent candidates in the lead-up to the 2022 federal election. In November the federal Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, said he was close to introducing legislation that would set up a non-constitutional voice to parliament, on the back of a co-design process led by Tom Calma and Marcia Langton. That legislation has not yet been tabled and is unlikely to come before an election. That proposal was criticised by Labor’s Indigenous affairs spokesperson, Linda Burney, who said any attempt to create a voice to parliament which was not enshrined in the constitution would be a “fail”. Labor has pledged to enact the Uluru statement in its entirety if elected. Enshrining the voice in the constitution was a non-negotiable part of the reform, according to Anderson. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Generation after generation of us has tried to negotiate with the government of the day, we’ve set up our own organisations,” she said. “But with a swipe of the pen, the government of the day can just wipe them away. “There has to be fundamental change here. And the only thing we haven’t done, the only thing left standing was the constitution” Anderson said that trying to get recognition, representation and support for First Nations people felt like “running at a brick wall” but she would not give up hope that the Australian people would support the change. “Every generation it’s our turn to run at the brick wall. For God’s sake, eventually it’s got to topple.
