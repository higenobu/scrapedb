3/28/2022,"The ballgown is dead. Long live the simple white shirt. The look that will go down in history from this year’s Oscar ceremony is a crisp white shirt. And not only because both Will Smith and Chris Rock were wearing them during that incident, but because the best dressed on the red carpet passed on the fairytale frocks and chose white shirts instead. Zendaya, star of the six-statuette winning Dune, wore an ivory silk shirt with a deep collar and pearl-buttoned cuffs, cropped mid-ribcage above a sequined silver maxi skirt. The look was custom-made by Valentino Haute Couture for Zendaya, whose longtime stylist Law Roach has become one of Hollywood fashion’s most formidable power players, and who also dressed Venus Williams for the ceremony. Uma Thurman wore a more conventionally proportioned white shirt by Bottega Veneta, teamed with a floor length black satin skirt in a look which referenced the white shirt she wore in her own breakthrough role almost three decades ago as Mia Wallace in Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction. Kristen Stewart wore a sheer white shirt by Chanel – the crystal buttons unbuttoned beneath a fitted mini-tuxedo – with black hotpants. A gown wasn’t even on Stewart’s shortlist, with the last-minute decision coming down to a choice between pairing the shirt and jacket with shorts or with trousers. (“Kristen was like, ‘Let’s do it. Let’s go for shorts’,” Stewart’s stylist Tara Swennen told Harper’s Bazaar.) Stewart’s fiancee, the actor and screenwriter Dylan Meyer, also wore a white shirt on the red carpet, pintucked and untucked. Wanda Sykes, one of the night’s co-hosts, wore a white shirt with rhinestone buttons under a Pamela Roland shawl-collared white tuxedo suit to walk the red carpet with her wife Alex Sykes, who wore a more Oscar-traditional sparkly dress. Lady Gaga, whose award ceremony fashion game has been the stuff of legend ever since she wore a dress made of meat to the 2010 MTV awards, chose a wing tip white shirt with a bow tie and tuxedo to close the ceremony, presenting the best picture award alongside Liza Minnelli. There were some spectacular outfits on the red carpet – Maggie Gyllenhaal in a surreal Schiaparelli gown dotted with gold rosettes which from some angles appeared to grow elephant’s trunks or rabbit’s ears; Kirsten Dunst making the sustainable choice in vintage Christian Lacroix; Billie Eilish in a vast stormcloud of gothic Gucci; Chloe Bailey in a purple beaded gown with a thigh split that reached to her armpit; and Kodi Smit-McPhee in an ice-blue Bottega Veneta tux – but perhaps the only star to steal the limelight from the white shirt wearers was Timothée Chalamet, who must have prompted a global frenzy of teenage fainting when he appeared on the red carpet wearing no shirt at all. The white shirt is an eye-catching pick at the Oscars, where the normal rules of dressing are reversed. Arrive bedecked in sequins or feathers and no one bats an eyelid; wear a plain white shirt, and hear the gasps. But more than that, a white shirt is an effective route for celebrities who want to be at the Oscars while simultaneously distancing themselves from those elements of the Academy Awards backstory which have become toxic. The traditional ballgown, steeped as it is in a patriarchal vision of femininity and redolent of high-society elitism, strikes a tone-deaf note as the Academy Awards continue to grapple with diversity of representation and of celebrating female creative talent. A white shirt on a woman – and its absence on a man, in the case of Chalamet – speaks of a break with the hubris the Oscars are trying to leave behind, and of a more modern attitude to gender. Worth noting, perhaps, that Chalamet picked his suit from the most recent Louis Vuitton womenswear collection, where it was last seen on a catwalk in Paris starring in Louis Vuitton’s show at the Musee d’Orsay earlier this month. The white shirt has been an onscreen classic since Lauren Bacall wore one opposite Humphrey Bogart in 1948’s Key Largo, and more recently has earned a red carpet style pedigree. In 1998, Sharon Stone wore a white cotton shirt from The Gap with a lavender satin Vera Wang skirt, a combination which raised eyebrows at the time but which is now seen as one of her best red carpet moments. Diane Keaton, an iconic white-shirt wearer onscreen as Annie Hall, wore a white shirt with a Ralph Lauren frock coat and bowler hat for the 2004 Oscars, when she was nominated for her role in Something’s Gotta Give. The hottest look on the red carpet is one that most people watching have hanging in their wardrobes already. Maybe the Oscars really have changed.",Lifestyle/Fashion,And the Red Carpet Oscar goes to ... the white shirt (or no shirt),https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/28/oscars-2022-fashion-red-carpet-white-shir
3/28/2022,"Twelve hours after its forces attacked Ukraine last month, Russian government officials and senior soldiers in South Africa gathered at a comfortable residence in the city of Pretoria for a cocktail reception to celebrate Russian Motherland Defenders’ Day. The host was the Russian ambassador, Ilya Rogachev, and his guests included the South African minister of defence as well as the head of the country’s armed forces. Neither saw any reason to shun the gathering as many other nations’ officials did, nor to apologise afterwards. Attendance was “integral to the fulfilment of defence international affairs”, a government spokesperson said. Support from many African leaders and governments for Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine – or at least reluctance to condemn it – has dismayed western officials. At the UN general assembly resolution 17 African nations abstained – almost half all abstentions – and one voted against condemning Russia for its ‘aggression’ and demanding a withdrawal from Ukraine, though a majority of African countries gave it their backing. The resolution passed by 141 to 5. Some observers have raised the possibility of a new strategic split across Africa, similar to that during the cold war. “It harks back to cold war days and the divisions we saw then. But … the objective reality of the international system is so different now this raises a lot of questions about some African countries’ commitment to the post-cold war order and its values,” said Priyal Singh, researcher at Institute for Strategic Studies in Pretoria. Since then, the ambassador’s party – the ruling African National Congress party in South Africa – has doubled down on its refusal to criticise Russia, saying it hopes to remain neutral and encourage dialogue. Others on the continent have followed a similar line, calling for peace but blaming Nato’s eastward expansion for the war, complaining of western “double standards” and resisting all calls to criticise Russia. That the new divide looks like the one which split Africa decades ago is no coincidence. Many countries across the continent are still ruled by parties that were supported by Moscow during their struggles for liberation from colonial or white supremacist rule, analysts say. Though few among their youthful populations experienced the bitter battles of the 1960s, 1970s or 1980s, leaders of ruling parties in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Angola and Mozambique remember how Soviet weapons, cash and advisers helped win freedom. Emmerson Mnangagwa, the president of Zimbabwe, has described both Russia and China as “dependable pillars for many years” which “assisted us in our fight for independence, but equally … to defend our sovereignty against the sustained onslaught by our detractors,” a reference to western sanctions on Zimbabwe, imposed after human rights abuses under the regime of Robert Mugabe. Mozambique also abstained at the UN, arguing like others that it hoped to encourage dialogue to resolve the violence. So too did Algeria, once seen as a “revolutionary” state close to Moscow. In recent years Russia has moved to exploit such historic links, underlining ties in public statements, at big conferences and on repeated trips across Africa by foreign minster Sergei Lavrov. Moscow has also pushed its agenda through covert social media networks which portray Moscow as on the side of Africans against western “imperialists”. Such efforts have focused on unstable parts of Africa, which Moscow sees as a fertile ground for intervention, and have reaped significant rewards in places like Central African Republic and Mali, where resentment of former colonial power France already ran deep. “In the Sahel there is a strong anti-western feeling, an anti-imperialist tendency in public opinion and anti-imperialist means anti-US and the west,” said Pauline Bax, deputy director of the Africa Programme at the International Crisis Group. Mali has recently renewed ties with Moscow after a military takeover there, and the country’s new rulers have called in paramilitary mercenaries linked to the Kremlin to fight Islamic insurgents as French and other western troops withdraw. The Wagner group is run by a businessman who is a close associate of President Putin and is now thought to be present in at least six African countries, including the CAR and Sudan which both abstained at the UN. Boris Johnson announced sanctions against Wagner on Thursday. Sudan has also tilted closer to Moscow in recent months. The country, where a military coup last year derailed a fragile transition to democratic rule, has concluded a big deal offering Russia a port on Africa’s eastern coast for 25 years. Eritrea – the only nation on the continent to vote against the UN motion– is a brutally repressive authoritarian state which Moscow has also wooed. Other Russian ties across the continent are strengthened through investment in mining, financial loans and the sale of agricultural equipment or nuclear technology. Rosatom, the Russian state corporation involved with military and civil use of nuclear energy, has sought to expand in Africa in recent years. Russia was the largest arms exporter to sub-Saharan Africa in 2016–20, supplying almost a third of total sub-Saharan arms imports, up from a quarter in 2011–15, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Western officials have been particularly disappointed by Uganda, which has received huge sums of western aid. A once close relationship with the US and the UK has soured over the crushing of political dissent and western pressure to recognise LGBT rights. Yoweri Museveni, in power since 1986, has accused the west of interfering in domestic affairs. Museveni’s influential son and aspirant successor, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, said on Twitter that “the majority of mankind (that are non-white) support Russia’s stand in Ukraine”. Uganda’s UN representative said Uganda abstained from the vote on the UN resolution to protect its neutrality as the next chair of the Non-Aligned Movement, a cold war-era group of 120 member states that includes almost every African nation. However Museveni has made little effort to hide his sympathies, criticising the west’s “aggression against Africa” and describing Russia as the “centre of gravity” for the Balkans, like China in south-east Asia. Nicholas Sengoba, a columnist with Uganda’s Daily Monitor newspaper, said that many authoritarian African leaders like Museveni were pleased to see Putin “stand up to the big boys in the west.” Analysts say that more recent examples of what is seen as western ‘neo-imperialism” also influences the reaction of many in Africa to the conflict. “The 2011 Libyan crisis and the Nato intervention there, instability in the Sahel and other experiences mean that many countries buy into the wariness of western dominance and believe that we need a global counterpoint … Russia is seen as representative of the former Soviet Union in this regard,” said Singh. Reports that some African students have faced discrimination from security officials and others in Ukraine as they attempt to flee the conflict, magnified by social media, have also prompted anger in Nigeria and elsewhere. But it is unclear how far the positions taken by often elderly leaders reflects broader sentiments, especially among younger populations. The war in Ukraine has laid bare political, social and other divides within countries, as well as among them. In South Africa, the populist leftwing Economic Freedom Fighters praised Moscow’s action to “avert … a patent and clear security threat to Russian territory and people by Nato forces, and particularly the US”, while the centre right Democratic Alliance projected the colours of the Ukrainian flag on to the provincial parliament in Cape Town, a city it runs, and said it joined “the global condemnation of Russia’s attack on Ukrainian civilians, mostly women and children.” The anti-western and anti-Nato stance of some on the continent risks overshadowing the early stance against the invasion of Ukraine taken by the African Union, and the speech made by Kenya’s ambassador to the UN, Martin Kimani, who argued that as Africans had suffered imperialist violence themselves for centuries they should not condone efforts to alter or impose frontiers by force. “It’s important to note that a majority of African nations voted in favour [of the UN resolution] and that regional and continental bodies such as the African Union or the ECOWAS [a West Africa grouping] were quite quick to condemn Moscow,” said Bax. One recent study found that the 27 African countries that voted for the UN resolution were mostly democracies and all western allies, often actively involved in joint military operations. Most of those that abstained or, like Eritrea, voted against the resolution, were authoritarian or hybrid regimes.",News/World news,Cold war echoes as African leaders resist criticising Putin’s war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/28/cold-war-echoes-african-leaders-resist-criticising-putins-war-ukraine
3/28/2022,"Victoria’s transport infrastructure minister, Jacinta Allan, has accused the Morrison government of short-changing the state on infrastructure ahead of a multi-billion package for freight terminals being detailed in Tuesday’s federal budget. Allan also urged the federal government to justify why it was prioritising a freight terminal in Melbourne’s north – at odds with the Andrews government’s location preference – as part of a $3.1bn injection for Melbourne’s intermodal terminal scheme. The budget will outline a national $17.9bn infrastructure package for new and existing road and rail projects, including in key marginal seats, to be spent over the next decade. The Morrison government will back two Victorian freight terminals – one in Melbourne’s north and the other in the western suburbs – in a $3.3bn infrastructure spend for Victoria. The commonwealth said the new freight terminals would take 550 trucks off Melbournes’s roads every day once completed and support jobs growth. Allan on Monday slammed the $3.1bn spend on two freight terminals, saying two-thirds of the package had already been announced. “Now we’re having that $2bn re-heated, put into another package,” she said. “Once again, as we’ve seen on so many occasions under a federal Liberal Nationals governments, we see Victoria being short changed.” The federal government will commit $1.2bn for a freight terminal at Beveridge, north of Melbourne, and $740m toward a freight terminal at Truganina, west of Melbourne. A further $1.2bn will be committed for surrounding road and rail connections. The funding is conditional, requiring financial contributions from the Andrews government. The federal backing of the two locations comes after the Andrews government and commonwealth clashed over the preferred location of a single freight hub. The state government has favoured Truganina while the federal government prefers the Beveridge site. Allan on Monday said there was “logic” behind the Andrews government pushing for the western location and called on the federal government to explain why they were backing the Beveridge site. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The western suburbs of Melbourne is the heart of Australia’s freight and logistics industry,” she said. “It’s the terminal that’s actually going to have the most impact and getting trucks off the roads.” Allan said the Andrews government would continue to “push really strongly” to ensure the Truganina site was “first cab off the rank.” “It’s the site that will not just benefit Victoria, but indeed the nation as a whole.” Victorian opposition leader, Matthew Guy, accused the state government of “treating the federal government like an ATM”. The two terminals are part of the Melbourne Intermodal Terminal scheme – unveiled by the federal government in last year’s budget – that aims to increase efficiency of national freight and maximise the Inland Rail to ensure the state’s infrastructure can accommodate it. The Beveridge location is key for connecting the Melbourne intermodal scheme to the Inland Rail project, which has strong backing from the Nationals. The 1700km freight line will stretch from Melbourne to Brisbane via regional Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. Infrastructure Partnerships Australia chief executive, Adrian Dwyer, said both freight sites would be critical in the future to ensure the nation could operate a “modern and sophistical” freight and supply chain network. But the executive director of the McKell Institute, Ryan Batchelor, said if the federal government was backing two sites, the Truganina site was likely to be the one to eventuate. “I’m not sure where there has been successful delivery of a commonwealth project in Victoria when the state government hasn’t been an active supporter of it,” he said. The commonwealth’s infrastructure injection for Victoria also includes road upgrades. The $3.3bn infrastructure package for Victoria is less than the $3.9bn committed for Queensland, but similar to $3.3bn for NSW. Another $2.8bn has been committed for South Australia. Earlier this month, the Grattan Institute released a report which found there was a “consistent pattern” of successive federal governments spending more money on transport in the election battleground states of New South Wales and Queensland – than in Victoria. Victoria has just over one quarter – 26% – of Australia’s population, but received just 18% of the federal transport funds over the past 15 years. New South Wales received a third of the transport funding, but has less than a third of the country’s population. A spokesperson for federal urban infrastructure minister, Paul Fletcher, said the budget would see Victoria’s share of federal government investment “remain at its population share over the 10-year pipeline”.",News/Australia news,"Freight terminal spending ‘short-changes’ Victoria, state government says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/28/freight-terminal-spending-short-changes-victoria-state-government-says
3/28/2022,"A Morrison government plan to change the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) to allow it to fund a broader range of technologies, including some using fossil fuels, has been blocked after a Liberal-led committee moved a motion against it. The government did not contest the Senate disallowance motion which was moved by the standing committee for the scrutiny of delegated legislation, chaired by the outgoing Liberal Concetta Fierravanti-Wells. The committee had earlier written to the energy minister, Angus Taylor, to warn it believed his proposal to change Arena’s remit without legislation went beyond what the parliament envisaged when it passed laws to create the agency. Taylor had attempted to use regulation to allow Arena to fund programs under the government’s technology investment roadmap, including carbon capture and storage as well as “clean” hydrogen made using gas. It is the second time the government’s proposed changes to Arena had been blocked. It was knocked back by the Senate in June last year after being opposed by Labor, the Greens and crossbench senators Rex Patrick, Stirling Griff and Jacqui Lambie. The government later reintroduced an altered version of the regulation that more tightly defined the technologies that could benefit and introduced a spending cap. The government chose not to contest the disallowance motion on Monday, saying it did not want to call a vote in the Senate out of respect for a condolence motion in the chamber for Labor senator Kimberley Kitching, who died suddenly earlier this month. A spokesperson for Taylor said the government remained committed to the change and would revisit it in the “immediate future”. It is likely a majority of senators, including from Labor, the Greens and several crossbenchers, would have supported Fierravanti-Wells in blocking the Arena changes if a vote had been called. Chris Bowen, the climate spokesperson for Labor, said the disallowance was “just the latest addition to the climate and energy bonfire that started with this government’s election nine years ago”. He said that the motion had been moved by a Liberal-led committee vindicated Labor’s fight to stop Arena from becoming a “slush fund”. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said it showed “Greens in parliament deliver for the climate”. “We helped set up Arena in the 2010 power-sharing parliament, we stopped [former prime minister] Tony Abbott abolishing it and now we’ve stopped the Liberals using the country’s renewable energy agency to funnel public money to coal and gas donors,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a letter to Taylor last year, Fierravanti-Wells noted the objective of the laws governing Arena was “to improve the competitiveness and supply of renewable energy in Australia”. The Liberal senator said there was nothing in the bill’s explanatory memorandum “to suggest that it was contemplated that the Arena would have the ability to foster anything other than renewable energy technologies”. “The committee is concerned that the [change] deals with the significant matter of expanding the jurisdiction of the Arena from investing in renewable energy technologies to programs relating to energy efficiency and low-emissions technology,” Fierravanti-Wells wrote. She said the committee believed the changes were “more appropriate for parliamentary enactment” – in other words, they should be made through legislation. On Monday, Fierravanti-Wells said the standing committee for the scrutiny of delegated legislation was a technical committee that assessed regulations against “a set of scrutiny principles”, and the disallowance motion followed a “unanimous and bipartisan recommendation of the committee” last year. The disallowance went through two days after Fierravanti-Wells was demoted to an unwinnable position on the NSW Coalition senate ticket. The government last year defended the proposed change, saying it would bring “a portfolio of technologies to commercial parity with higher-emitting alternatives so we can reduce emissions across every sector of the economy, while protecting industries and jobs, and creating new ones”. On Monday, a spokesperson for Taylor said it had not changed its position. “The government has withheld calling a division out of respect for the condolence motion for senator Kitching,” they said. “The government remains committed to the regulation and the role it plays in supporting the deployment of low-emissions technology. Expanding Arena’s remit has wide industry support.” Industry group the Smart Energy Council welcomed the disallowance. It said it had planned to launch legal action against the change if it was not disallowed in the Senate. “This is absolutely fantastic news that government money won’t be going to fossil fuel projects,” its chief executive, John Grimes, said. Officials told Senate estimates last year the government had drafted legislation to change Arena, but the minister opted to use regulation instead. Bowen told parliament he believed the government may not have introduced the drafted bill because it was concerned Coalition MPs would attempt to amend it to allow Arena to fund coal projects – as the then backbencher, now deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce did with legislation to change the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.",News/Australia news,Government plan to let renewable agency fund fossil fuels blocked after Liberal-led committee’s motion,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/28/morrison-plan-to-allow-renewable-agency-to-fund-fossil-fuels-blocked-by-liberal-led-committee
3/28/2022,"Leicester City’s 1-0 victory against Southampton at Filbert Street on Saturday 9 September 2000 was a thoroughly unremarkable game. The home side dominated for long periods before the original Harry Maguire prototype, Gerry Taggart, headed them into a deserved lead from a Steve Guppy corner after 66 minutes. Leicester held out for the win, surviving a late penalty appeal from Southampton when James Beattie went down under a challenge from Tim Flowers. While the match may not have lived long in the memory of anyone who saw or played in it, it was a very special occasion for at least one participant. Recently promoted to the Select Group of Premier League referees, a 32-year-old match official from Wirral took charge of the game. It was his first in the top flight and, despite the presence on the pitch of Robbie Savage, a player who was as argumentative as he was combative, it could scarcely have been more straightforward for the novice whistleblower. There were no bookings, no sendings-off and few moments of controversy. Travelling home afterwards to write up his match report, Mike Dean could have been forgiven for thinking he had this refereeing lark sussed. Dean has officiated 552 further Premier League matches in the intervening 22 years and it would be fair to say that not all of them have gone as smoothly for a man who has since become the most recognisable and controversial football referee in the country. Last week it was reported he is to hang up his whistle at the end of the season and he is understood to be in talks with his employers, the Professional Game Match Officials Limited, with a view to taking a senior role among the much-maligned curtain-twitchers in the Stockley Park video room. While the news of his potential new gig has prompted much eye-rolling among the many managers, players, fans and members of the punditocracy who view him as a pompous, overly officious popinjay, the vastly experienced 53‑year‑old might just be the ideal candidate to whip the VAR room into shape. Dean is reviled by many who see him as something of a showman who seems a little too fond of the limelight, but for all his nutmegs, extravagant gestures and no-look yellow cards – not to mention that infamous and ill-advised celebration of one of his own decisions to play an advantage that led to a Tottenham goal against Aston Villa – he is actually very good at what has, in recent years, become an increasingly difficult job. British football currently finds itself in a refereeing crisis, with insufficient numbers of officials willing to subject themselves to the general hassle and occasional violence that taking charge of games at grassroots level regularly entails. Further up the food chain, those who do stick at the job for long enough to become professional and work in front of increasingly large crowds have their every decision subjected to unprecedented and often unfair levels of scrutiny, which only serves to fuel inevitable toxic abuse from those in the stands who remain convinced there is some big conspiracy against their team. Of course referees make high-profile blunders, two of which came from Dean in quick succession a little over a year ago and led to him asking to be stood down after he received online death threats for the heinous crime of being overzealous when it came to brandishing his red card. At this point, it behoves us to mention that Dean has shown a record 114 red cards to various footballing miscreants in the course of his career. It’s a large number, but one that ought to come as no great surprise considering how much more experienced he is than his peers. “I’ve had a lot of grief over the years,” he told Peter “Tubes” Dale of Soccer AM fame during a long interview over a round of golf last year. “Some deserved, some not deserved. It does come with the job, rightly or wrongly. If you do upset one set of fans, you don’t go out there to do it on purpose. You make an honest mistake, put your hands up and move on.” While referees must try to move on, those affronted to the point of apoplexy by their errors often seem to find it far less easy to do so. It was telling that news of the threats levelled at Dean was greeted with the utmost gravitas by assorted British TV and radio networks who seem almost comically unaware that, by devoting large tracts of airtime to often ill-informed analysis of the errors made by match officials, they are fanning the flames of outrage. “Next up, Peter Walton spends 10 uninterrupted minutes poring over the excruciating minutiae of an entirely subjective call made by one of his former colleagues, then after the break we’ll clutch our collective pearls when football’s more paranoid and tribalistic fans get ridiculously upset by that decision we’ve just put under our giant microscope.” VAR remains a particular bone of contention, an innovation that has successfully solved some problems for football officialdom while simultaneously creating an apparently endless stream of new controversies for angry conspiracy theorists to rage and rail against. “It’s not going away so we’ve got to get used to it,” Dean said last year. “I think it will work.” A good communicator who is reported to be popular among his peers and will have 22 seasons of top-flight refereeing experience behind him when he retires from on-field officiating, Dean is as well-placed as anyone in the country to help iron out the kinks that continue to bedevil VAR and its use in English football. If anyone can master the art of no-look video assistance, it surely is him.",Sport/Football,Mike Dean could be the man to fix VAR after his final whistle – if we let him | Barry Glendenning,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/28/mike-dean-could-be-the-man-to-fix-var-after-retiring

3/28/2022,"If you’re looking for narcissism, Rob Drummond offers it fourfold. His adaptation of Roald Dahl’s 1977 short story is a hall of mirrors in which ego is layered upon ego. Our entry point is 14-year-old Mary, played by a bubbly Eve Buglass, whose mission is to break out of single-figure subscribers on her YouTube channel. With an unwavering belief in her own attractiveness, she waits for the likes to come in while listening to an audiobook. That leads us to the tale of egotist number two, the independently wealthy Henry Sugar. Played by a suave and preening David Rankine, Henry is his own biggest fan. He too reads a book, which brings us to egotist three: Rosalind Sydney’s Jane Cartwright, a doctor with a thirst for personal glory. Her subject of scientific interest, Johndeep More’s Imhrat Khan, who claims to be able to see with his eyes closed, may seem more modest, but he too longs to be the centre of attention. These comic grotesques circle each other in a cheery production by Ben Harrison that delights in illusions and mind-reading tricks. Imhrat uses magic to put himself in the spotlight; Henry uses it to win at the casino. Their inspiration helps Mary conjure up online followers and the effects, by magic designer Fergus Dunnet, receive repeated rounds of applause. But for all Drummond’s clever parallels, Harrison’s colour and the actors’ fizzy performances, Dahl’s story lacks jeopardy. The egos might be monstrous but they don’t actually cause much damage. That leaves us with little sense of a problem to be resolved. And although the characters reach some kind of enlightenment, it is because of inner reflection not dramatic conflict.

3/28/2022,"My family adores this chicken any time of year, but especially around Easter as it has the subtle promise of sunnier spring days with the addition of the apricots. They’re not at all overwhelming but add a lovely sweetness to balance out the spices – so much so that even my young children can’t get enough. If you can, make the butter and marinate the chicken a few hours before, or even overnight. You can also roast it up until it is just cooked through and finish the last 10 minutes on the barbecue, if it is an exceptionally warm day – which has happened! It’s a great barbecue dish. However you cook it, serve on the bed of onions, with lots of coriander to finish, and lots of buttery crushed new potatoes, roasted whole carrots and a peppery, lemon-dressed rocket salad. You can ask your butcher to spatchcock the chicken. Alternatively, cut down either side of the chicken’s backbone with a pair of sharp scissors and discard it. Then lay the chicken out flat like a book, skin side up. Press firmly on the breast bone with the palm of your hand to really flatten it out.

Drizzle the onions with the remaining olive oil, then place the chicken on top. When you are ready to cook your chicken, preheat your oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6. Pour the hot stock into the base of the tray and pop in the oven. Cook for 1 hour, then turn the oven up to 200C/gas mark 7 for a further 10 minutes, to get a lovely char on the skin, until just cooked through (pierce the meat in the thigh, and check that the juices run clear. There shouldn’t be any blood). Remove the tray from the oven, and you can leave it to rest as is. But I like to pop the tray directly on the hob for a few more minutes, just enough to reduce the stock a little more until slightly thickened. Spoon the juices and onions onto a large serving platter and top with the charred chicken. Finish by roughly chopping and scattering over the remaining coriander.

3/28/2022,"When it comes to dinner parties, cooking a leg or shoulder of lamb is always a good idea – but for a special occasion, such as Easter Sunday lunch, I like the more refined lamb fillet. It has little fat and is ideal for cooking either whole or cut into thick noisettes. This recipe fulfils my personal fantasy of lamb loins individually wrapped in a flaky, buttery, burnished pastry. The stuffing of lactic feta and mouth-puckering sumac borrows flavours from Greece and Lebanon, tart enough to cut through the richness of the red meat. Serve with new potatoes and wilted spinach. Serves 4boneless lamb loin fillets 4 × 100golive oil 3 tbsp, plus extra for brushingred onions 3, thinly slicedthyme 3 sprigs, leaves pickedsoft brown sugar 1 tspred wine 100mlfeta cheese 150g, well-drained and crumbledsumac 2 tsppine nuts 40gchopped mint a handfulready-rolled all-butter puff pastry 1 x 375g sheetegg yolks 2, lightly beatensea salt and black pepper Brush the lamb fillets with a little olive oil and season with plenty of salt and pepper. Pour 2 tablespoons of the oil into a frying pan over high heat, add the lamb and sear on all sides, including the ends, until the meat has a lovely golden brown crust. Remove from the pan and leave to cool to room temperature. Wipe out the pan and fry the onions in the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat until softened, then add the thyme and sugar and cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are caramelised. Pour in the red wine and let it bubble and reduce until syrupy. Transfer to a bowl and set aside to cool. Stir the feta, sumac, pine nuts and mint into the cooled onions. On a flour-dusted surface, cut the pastry sheet into 4 rectangles, each large enough to enclose a lamb fillet, leaving a 1cm border at each end. Cut lengthways along each loin to make a pocket, being careful not to go all the way through. Divide the onion mixture evenly between the pockets, then pop a stuffed lamb fillet on each pastry rectangle. Brush the edges of the pastry with beaten egg yolk and fold over the pastry to wrap the lamb, pressing the edges of the pastry with the prongs of a fork to seal. Place the lamb wellingtons, seam side down, on a baking sheet lined with baking parchment. Glaze with beaten egg yolk, then use the back of a knife to mark each parcel with long diagonal lines, being careful not to cut into the pastry. Chill for at least 1 hour to firm up. When you’re ready to cook the wellingtons, preheat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6 and bake for 25-30 minutes – the pastry will be crisp and golden, and the meat should be cooked to medium.

3/28/2022,"Don’t feel you need to make all the components of this cake. Unadorned, it makes a satisfying snack – light enough for a lunchbox treat or a morning cup of tea. But with the ganache and pecan brittle, this is a cake worthy of a celebration. The brittle can be made up to two days in advance and stored in an airtight container. The recipe makes rather more of the brittle than you’ll need, but it is an addictive snack and you will undoubtedly be munching on it before it goes on top of the cake.

Preheat the oven to 190C fan/gas mark 6½ and line a small baking tray with baking paper. Combine golden syrup and sugar in a small saucepan, and stir gently over low heat until the sugar is completely dissolved – about 2 minutes. Fold in the pecans and sea salt until combined, then remove from the heat and scrape on to the lined tray. Bake for about 8 minutes until golden and bubbly, then remove from the oven and allow to cool on the tray. When the brittle is completely hard, roughly chop or bash with a rolling pin to break it up into irregular pieces. Store in an airtight container until needed. To make the cake, preheat the oven to 175C fan/gas mark 5½. Grease and line a 30cm x 22cm baking tin with baking paper, then set aside. In a small saucepan swirl the milk gently over medium heat. When small bubbles begin to appear around the edges (just before it starts to boil), remove from the heat and add the cocoa powder, coffee and cinnamon. Whisk to combine, then set aside to cool and to allow the cocoa to “bloom” – about 10 minutes. Mash the bananas to a smooth puree, then add to the cocoa mix with the vanilla essence. Fold to combine, then set aside. Sift the flour, bicarbonate of soda, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl. Place the butter and sugars in the bowl of a cake mixer, and beat with the paddle attachment on medium-high speed until light and creamy. Reduce the speed to low and add the eggs, one at a time, scraping the bowl after each addition. Still on low speed, add the sifted dry ingredients in 3 batches, alternating with the banana and cocoa mixture. Beat until smooth and combined, then scrape the batter into the prepared baking tray. Place in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven and cool completely before turning it out on to a serving plate or board. While the cake is in the oven, make the ganache. Place the chopped chocolate in a medium bowl and heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat. When small bubbles appear at the edges (just before it starts to boil), remove the pan from heat and pour the hot cream over the chocolate. Allow it to sit for 1 minute, then stir to combine. Cool slightly, then press some clingfilm on to the mix and place in the fridge until needed. When ready to serve, use a hand whisk to whip the ganache until it is light and creamy (if it has set very firm, you may find it easier to whip the ganache with the whisk attachment in the cake mixer). Spread the whipped ganache thickly all over the top of the cooled cake, then sprinkle liberally with the pecan brittle.

And before Easter it’s very important to send out letters that have shapes cut out of them and include a number of dots corresponding to the number of letters in the sender’s name.

To temper the chocolate, melt two-thirds of it in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water, making sure the base of the bowl is not touching the water. As soon as it reaches 50C, remove the bowl from the pan and add the remaining chopped chocolate. Mix well until all the chocolate has melted. Gently heat again over the pan of water until it reaches a temperature of 31C (it will have dropped below that when you added the chopped chocolate). Immediately coat the eggs in the tempered chocolate and place on a tray lined with baking parchment. Place the walnuts on some eggs, and the lemon zest on others. Leave the rest plain. Once the chocolate has set, store in an airtight container. If you like, you can add all kinds of flavourings to the marzipan before you cover it in chocolate, like Cognac, orange zest, nuts or spices. I just happen to like mine simple and classic.

3/28/2022,"Unlike chickens, which lay eggs most of the year, ducks tend to lay seasonally, in the spring. The eggs are very beautiful, coming in a range of pale, semi-translucent shades of white and sometimes blue. The texture of the shell is like alabaster – quite different from a chicken’s egg. Inside the shell the egg is different, too: a large yolk equivalent to two chicken yolks and a relatively small white. The flavour is stronger and richer. Duck eggs are also marvellous for baking, with the large yolks adding extra richness and a wonderful yellow colour to a sponge cake.

Meanwhile, snap off the dry, woody base from each asparagus spear. Using a potato peeler, shave the parmesan into thin slivers and crumble them up a little with your fingers. Slice the sage leaves as thinly as you can. Once the water is boiling rapidly, add the asparagus and cook for about 2 minutes, until just tender. Drain through a colander and set aside. Melt half the butter in a frying pan, break in the duck eggs and fry, seasoning with a little salt and pepper as they cook. Quickly heat the remaining butter in a separate frying pan, large enough to hold the asparagus. When it begins to brown, throw in the sage and squeeze in the lemon juice. Add the cooked asparagus, season with a little salt and pepper and toss gently so that the asparagus is well coated in the butter and lemon. Share the asparagus out between 2 warm plates, put the eggs on top and sprinkle with the parmesan. Serve with bread and butter.

3/28/2022,"These might sound more wintry but this time of the year is filled with just as many cold days as warm ones, and these warming, quick little scones are the kind of thing I make when we run out of bread, or if I want to make a bowl of soup look a bit more like a meal. These are hard to mess up, so if bread is a stretch for you these are a better bet. I use swede, as it’s pretty much my favourite root vegetable through the winter: cheap, British and abundant, and its season lasts a little longer than the other roots – into the early spring.

3/28/2022,"Simple springtime vegetable dishes like this have always figured highly in our family. When we were on holiday in Sicily, I used to make a little stew with the long, bendy, green zucca trombetta, which is a kind of cross between a courgette and a pumpkin. I would sauté it with onions and garlic, add some spinach and peas, cover it with white wine and simmer it for 20 minutes or so. Vignarola is simply a celebration of that moment in spring when you have an abundance of beautiful artichokes, and the first of the broad beans and peas. It is so simple, but what makes it special is that the vegetables are cooked one after the other in olive oil and with the tiniest amount of water, so that each one tastes totally of itself. As the season goes on you can take some vegetables away and add others, such as spinach or chard, but keep the essence of the dish by using good frozen broad beans and peas. I like to have any that is left over in the fridge to smash up for a sandwich, with burrata and toasted bread, or warm up alongside some grilled chicken or steak. One morning on holiday in Puglia in the spring, for brunch I made a vignarola quickly with fresh peas and beans I had bought in the market along with some cime di rapa (turnip tops). I toasted some bread, fried a couple of local farm eggs, broke them up and mixed them into the vegetables, which I crushed a little bit, and we ate from bowls, sitting looking out at the sea, and it felt like some of the best food I had made in my life. Serves 6lemon 1artichokes 4 smallolive oil a littlespring onions 5, choppedsea salt and freshly ground black pepperfresh broad beans 200g, poddedfresh peas 200g, poddedfresh mint leaves 10 “Turning” or preparing an artichoke is a little fiddly, but not difficult. The thing to remember is that artichokes discolour very quickly, so once you cut them, they need to go straight into water that has been acidulated with lemon juice. Have ready a big bowl of cold water. Cut a lemon in half, squeeze the juice into the water, then put the halves of lemon in, too. Then as you work, you can either dip the artichoke into the lemon water or just use the halved lemons to rub directly on to the exposed surfaces. Hold the artichoke in one hand, then work your way around it snapping off and discarding the hard outer leaves from the base, until you reach the tender, yellow leaves underneath. Cut off the bottom of the stalk, and with a small paring knife, trim off the stringy outside part all the way around the stalk, back to the core. Trim and scrape away the hard pieces around the base of each artichoke. Finally trim off the spiky tops of each of the leaves that are left using a sharp knife, then slice across the very top of the artichoke – take off about 2cm – enough to remove the spiky tops and reveal the choke inside. Because the artichoke is actually a flower bud, the most important thing for it to do is to put out its seeds, so even when it is cut by its stalk off the plant, the choke – or beard, as I call it – will continue to grow, trying to develop into a flower. If the artichoke has been freshly harvested or is very small, the choke will barely have formed, but the longer it has been cut from the plant, or the older or bigger it is, the more the choke will have developed. So you need to scoop this out with a teaspoon. The easiest way to do this is to slice the artichokes in half lengthways first. As soon as the artichokes are sliced in half and the chokes removed, cut them into quarters and keep them in the acidulated water until you are ready to use them. Heat a little olive oil in a pan, add the spring onions and cook briefly. Drain the artichokes and add to the pan. Season, cover and cook for 2 minutes. Add the broad beans with a couple of tablespoons of water and cook for another 2 minutes, then add the peas, plus another 2 tablespoons of water. Cook for another 2 minutes, adding a little more water if necessary. Each vegetable should now be tender and the water should have been absorbed. Finish with the mint leaves. Eat warm or cold.

3/28/2022,"Concetta Fierravanti-Wells has criticised “the Liberal party sisterhood” for lacking the “gumption” to speak out against toxic parliamentary culture. The Liberal senator, who has recently been relegated to an unwinnable spot on the party’s New South Wales Senate ticket, shared an emotional tribute in parliament to the late Victorian Labor senator, Kimberley Kitching, while unleashing a barrage of criticism about her own colleagues. In a condolence session paying tribute to Kitching’s life and service on Monday, Fierravanti-Wells told parliament she also believed bitter factional in-fighting contributed to the Senator’s sudden death at the age of 52. She said she had established a friendship with Kitching, a Victorian Labor rightwinger, because of their shared concern about “the challenging issue posed by the communist regime in China” and over challenges to their respective preselections. The Liberal senator said that she and Kitching were outspoken and unconstrained by the “prevalent group think within our political parties”, and that they had commiserated with one another about the “slings and arrows” of pitched internal battles. Emotions brimming, Fierravanti-Wells declared both had internal enemies who “desperately wanted to see us defeated and they worked very hard at it”. She said both the major parties were now facing court actions as a consequence of internal rancour about preselection processes. “I’m sorry Kimberley that you were not able to withstand the pressure,” Fierravanti-Wells on Monday. “I have no doubts that the stress of fighting for your political career took its toll and led to your death. “Your death put much into context for me. It made me realise that all the stress associated with factional warfare is not worth the toll it takes on health and family.” As well as battling internal dramas, the Liberal senator alleged she and Kitching had also been treated poorly by their female colleagues. Fierravanti-Wells said: “The concept of mean girls is not confined to one political party.” “Much has been written about the treatment Kimberley received by what the media has described as the mean girls,” she said. “Like Kimberley, I too had experienced the Liberal party sisterhood.” Fierravanti-Wells noted that after she gave an interview to the Four Corner’s “Inside the Canberra Bubble” program in November 2020, supplying “fair, neutral and appropriate comments” none of her female colleagues supported her. She said her female Coalition colleagues – whom she did not name – would “privately whinge and complain” about political culture, but people ultimately lacked the “gumption”, “fortitude” or “appetite” to speak out. “I suspect they were concerned about being summoned for a fireside chat with the threat of demotion for breaching group think,” Fierravanti-Wells said. “I shared my own experiences with Kimberley, so I understood how Kimberley felt having been treated the way she was.” The Liberal senator’s reference to “mean girls” is a reference to a news story in the Australian in the mid-March headlined: “How Labor’s ‘mean girls’ ostracised Kimberley Kitching.” That article suggested Labor frontbenchers Penny Wong, Kristina Keneally and Katy Gallagher had isolated Kitching after a series of disagreements. In his eulogy for Kitching at her memorial service in Melbourne, the late senator’s husband, Andrew Landeryou, told mourners “the unpleasantness” Kitching experienced from a “cantankerous cabal” inside the parliamentary party and outside it “did baffle and hurt her”. Wong, Keneally and Gallagher have flatly denied bullying Kitching. Kitching and Fierravanti-Wells, both rightwingers in their respective political movements, have been significant factional operators during their parliamentary careers. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Keneally told the Senate on Monday that Kitching was a formidable colleague, plain-speaking and comfortable with the use of power. “She was never to be underestimated,” Keneally said. “She made her decisions. She was not manipulated by others in her career, beliefs or passions. “I would never have described her as a shrinking violet. She was never backwards about coming forward. If she had a view, she put it. In many ways I found this refreshing.” Implicitly referencing some of the score-settling and in-fighting that has erupted after Kitching’s death, Keneally told the Senate: “Those who use the grief caused by her death for purposes other than honouring her life and her work will find no friend in me.” Wong, Labor’s Senate leader, noted that much had been “said and written in the days since Senator Kitching’s passing”. “Many are hurting and many are grieving,” Wong told the chamber. “I understand that grief and loss can be so profound that it can provoke anger and blame. “I have made my views very clear outside this place about some of that misplaced anger and blame. “I will not return anger with anger, or blame with blame.”",News/Australia news,Concetta Fierravanti-Wells criticises ‘Liberal sisterhood’ for staying quiet on toxic culture in parliament,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/28/concetta-fierravanti-wells-criticises-sisterhood-for-staying-quiet-on-toxic-culture-in-parliament
3/28/2022,"Onboard a small whale-watching boat making its way across the choppy waters of Faxaflói Bay, off the south-west coast of Iceland, a guide urges tourists not to eat whale meat. “We have a campaign here against whaling,” says Estelle, who has been pointing out whales and dolphins from the boat. “It’s better to meet them in person than to eat them.” Iceland, one of the few countries in the world to hunt whales commercially, announced in February its plan to end the practice from 2024, though it has not officially banned it yet. Falling demand for whale meat, especially since Japan resumed commercial whaling in 2019, has influenced the decision. “There is little proof that there is any economic advantage to this activity,” Svandís Svavarsdóttir, the country’s fisheries minister, wrote in the newspaper Morgunblaðið. But experts also credit a 15-year-long campaign carried out largely by Icelanders and local whale-watching companies. Whaling has been practised around Iceland since the early 1600s, but it wasn’t until the 19th century that steamships and explosive harpoons allowed US and European companies to hunt the animals on a large commercial scale. Iceland stopped commercial whaling in 1985 and scientific whaling four years later under the international moratorium on commercial hunts. But commercial whaling resumed in 2006. Current annual quotas allow for 209 fin whales to be killed in Iceland, to be sent to Japan, along with 217 minke whales, which are eaten domestically. Since the practice restarted, an association of local whale-watching companies, led by the non-profits International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and IceWhale, have fought to end it. Their campaign has aimed to turn the tide on whale hunting in Iceland using the slogan “meet us, don’t eat us”. Contrary to what many visitors believe, whale is not considered a delicacy among Icelanders, says Arni Finnsson, chair of the Iceland Nature Conservation Association, who worked on the campaign. Only 2% of Icelanders say they regularly eat it, according to IFAW. Instead, the biggest eaters of minke whale have been the country’s roughly 2 million annual visitors, many of whom believe it is an Icelandic speciality. “We had tourists who would see whales and then ask where they could go and eat them,” says Megan Whittaker, head naturalist at Elding, a whale-watching organisation. A plan was hatched by IFAW and IceWhale to end the practice. In 2009, IWAF launched one of the country’s most successful petitions, which now has almost 175,000 signatories, asking people to sign a declaration that they would not eat whale meat. From 2011, the campaign sent volunteers into restaurants, asking them to stop serving the animal, and more than 60 restaurants are now labelled as “whale friendly”. The campaign cut whale meat consumption by tourists in Iceland by three-quarters, according to IFAW, which says it does regular tourist surveys. “Meet us, don’t eat us” has had a big influence on the government’s approach to whaling, says Belén García Ovide, founder of Ocean Missions, an Icelandic non-profit not involved in the campaign. “[Politicians] have realised that a whale that’s alive brings more economic benefits than a dead whale,” she says. Whale watching has become a booming business. One in five tourists in Iceland take a whale-watching trip, generating approximately $12m (£9m) annually, according to the Animal Fund. Tour companies have played a large role in the campaign to end whaling. “All of us whale-watching companies have been like propaganda,” says Gísli Ólafsson, owner of Lakitours, which operates in Iceland’s Westfjords. His tour guides have spoken about whaling on every trip for decades, he says. The companies also fought to eject whale hunters from Faxaflói Bay, which was one of the main hunting areas. “We always saw the whaling boats,” Whittaker says. “We saw the [dead] whales being tied to the side of the boat and being dragged. And we told the tourists about it.” In 2017, the fisheries minister announced an expanded “no whaling zone”, forcing hunters further out to sea, where there are fewer whales, making the practice economically unviable. When Japan resumed commercial whaling in 2019, demand for Iceland’s whales declined. Whale meat processing plants were also unable to operate as normal during the pandemic. Conservationists are now exploring ways to make whale tourism sustainable. Whale-watching companies have created a code of conduct, including agreeing not to make sudden noises, as well as to approach animals gradually and to take turns with other boats. But there is no legal requirement to follow this voluntary code, as there is in other whale-watching destinations, such as New Zealand or Canada. Ovide wants politicians to change this. Scientists are exploring whether whales get stressed by tourist boats, by measuring their cortisol levels and monitoring behaviour. The research, by charity Whale Wise in partnership with Edinburgh University and the University of Iceland, could lead to updates to the current code of conduct, says Tom Grove, the co-founder of Whale Wise. “I see whale watching as a fundamentally good thing,” Grove says. “But it’s about making it the best it can be and as sustainable as possible.” There are still some who are against the plan to end whaling. Kristján Loftsson, owner of Hvalur, a family business that has led the hunt of fin whales over the past few decades, told the Guardian he wants to continue as long as it is legal. He has said he will restart whaling for four months this summer for the first time in four years, with up to 150 people expected to be hired to work on whaling ships. Public support for whaling has declined in recent years. But for now, in Reykjavik harbour, boats used to kill whales continue to float alongside boats used for whale-watching trips. “You can see the whaling boats in front of ours,” Estelle says as our small boat pulls into land.
