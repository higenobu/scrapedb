4/26/2022,"As Low walk on stage, there’s the usual air of anticipation from fans, but with it a sense of tentative concern. How is this band of two married Minnesotans and a bassist, on a spacious stage, going to recreate the crushed concentration of an album like Hey What – a continuation of the experimental distortion of sound that surprised fans and critics on its predecessor, 2018’s Double Negative? Beginning with the stop-start staccato of Hey What’s opener White Horses, any such thoughts soon fall away. Dressed in black, guitarist Alan Sparhawk and drummer Mimi Parker, alongside Liz Draper who has replaced the band’s previous bassist Steve Garrington on tour, unleash a sustained, charged ambient cacophony that settles on the reverent crowd. Playing Hey What in almost its entirety, keening riffs and thundering drums recreate the techno distortions of the studio album. Silhouetting the musicians are three pillars of horizontal lights, like tall windows with venetian blinds through which branches, cars and streetlights appear. “I’m awake / Must be another day,” sings Sparhawk on I Can Wait, as a mood of desperation takes hold. Moving into their older albums, the same discomforting spell is held. Sparhawk dedicates No Comprende to a machete-wielding man he met in a Tennessee hotel, an absurd, end-the-world image that feeds into the hot paranoia of the song, as crimson lights soak the band. Across their last two albums, Low have been documenting the emotions of living through social collapse, distilling their anxieties into apocalyptic clouds of abrasive instrumentals. But always piercing through are Sparhawk and Parker’s voices, which, without digital effects, offer an anchor of human warmth. There’s sweetness to the couple’s harmonies and their on stage connection. “If you can’t tell by the body language, I’m being told to calm down,” Sparhawk says as Parker smiles. The gentle strumming guitar of Silver Rider and romantic sincerity of Will the Night close the set: the two older Low songs are a balm after the intensity of the evening. With a gentle “goodnight friends,” from Sparhawk, who begins to shuffle off stage still clutching his guitar, Low’s spell finally breaks. It’s less a triumph and more a gift of solace against the cruelty of the outside world, glimpsed through blinds.",Arts/Music,Low review – human warmth fills music of social collapse,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/26/low-review-the-queens-hall-edinburgh
4/26/2022,"Wales – poor, peripheral, reliably Labour voting – does not really figure in the political imaginations of Britain’s chattering class. To the extent that its politics are noticed at all, it is largely through the prism of expectations generated by developments in other parts of the UK. Most recently, this has led to significant interest in the extent to which the Welsh might eventually come to emulate the Scottish preoccupation with independence. There is indeed ample polling evidence that somewhere between 20 and 25% of Welsh voters would now vote yes in any referendum, with the shift towards independence particularly pronounced among younger, remain-leaning voters. This level of support is broadly adjacent to where things stood in Scotland a year before the independence vote. As such, it is perhaps not surprising that external observers search for signs that the entrenched nationalist-unionist binary that defines politics in what some Welsh speakers still call “yr Hen Ogledd” – the Old North – is about to be recreated in Wales. This kind of thing isn’t new. In the late 1960s and 70s, the extensive civil disobedience that eventually succeeded in ensuring that Wales is a now a visibly a bilingual country was constantly compared to (and often conflated with) Northern Ireland’s troubles. It is only now, in part through Richard King’s remarkable oral history, Brittle with Relics, that the story of this campaign – resolutely nonviolent and with women playing a leading role throughout – is being more widely discussed on its own terms. Yet what remains perhaps the most successful and sustained campaign of civil disobedience since the suffragettes remains remarkably little known in the rest of Britain. It will not do for us Welsh to get too prissy about this. Especially given that, in keeping with their colleagues in the UK government, many of our leading politicians have made good use of ways that expectations of Wales are shaped by perceptions of other parts of the state, to gain traction for their own political priorities. “If you don’t do as we ask, then our ‘nats’ might end up being as scary and powerful as those in the other parts of Celtic fringe” is a well-worn trope. Since the establishment of the Wales Office in Whitehall in 1965, those Labour and Conservative politicians who have taken ministerial roles there would have had even fewer cards to play were it not for the existence of Plaid Cymru. That said, reading across to Wales from Scotland, Northern Ireland or even England – as has often been the case in the context of Brexit – is almost always to miss out on what makes the country’s politics distinct and interesting. Take that unionist-nationalist binary now so deeply entrenched in Scotland. To the bemusement and indeed chagrin of many outsiders, that simply doesn’t apply in Wales. Whatever the differences between Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru, most of their supporters – and indeed elected members – would absolutely choose each other over the Tories. Indeed, the amount of common ground between them in terms of values and beliefs, even up to and including attitudes to Wales’ constitutional future, is genuinely remarkable. It is the Welsh Conservatives that stand out as being different – it is always worth recalling that England’s dominant party last won a general election in Wales in the thoroughly pre-democratic days of 1859. Meanwhile, while it is obviously true that there was a majority in Wales for Brexit at the 2016 referendum, it is a mistake – one which the Tories have continually repeated in the intervening years – to interpret this as a vote to ditch devolution as well as Europe. In fact, data from the 2021 Welsh Election Survey shows that 52% of leave voters in Wales (alongside 88% of remain voters) reject the idea of reducing devolved powers in order to “maximise [the] benefits” of leaving the European Union. If Brexit was indeed a vote for “cakeism”, then there is a Welsh variety that blends Euroscepticism with continuing support for home rule. But while it is possible to make a compelling case for discussing Welsh politics on its own merits, it is also a fact that Wales’ peculiar position within the union means that – as it stands – its political fate is being determined elsewhere. Notwithstanding the growth in support for independence at one end of the spectrum, and an effusion of anti-devolution sentiment at the other, in terms of domestic politics at least, the majority in Wales are relatively satisfied with their constitutional lot. A devolved Wales – perhaps with some additional powers – nested within a UK that is a little more willing to take seriously Welsh concerns: this is still the sweet spot as far as the Welsh are concerned. The problem is, of course, that this version of the British state is also one that requires the agreement of its other constituent units. It is far from certain that this agreement remains forthcoming. It’s not just that around half of Scotland’s electorate and that country’s dominant political party want out of the state altogether. Although, it must be said that the potential implications of Scotland’s departure from the union for Wales is the subject of a great deal of often anguished speculation across Wales’ political class – the Kingdom of England and Wales is not an attractive prospect. More immediately, the UK government is already using Brexit as a pretext for rolling back the powers of the Senedd and Welsh government. Egged on by Welsh Conservatives, in whose fervid imaginations Mark Drakeford stands “second only to Nicola Sturgeon” as a threat to the union, the Johnson administration is busily recentralising power, for example by cutting the Welsh government out from the post-EU economic development agenda. This all the while fetishising a version of parliamentary sovereignty that is very hard to reconcile with any form of devolution. It is impossible to predict the eventual outcome of all these cross-pressures. Welsh electoral politics continues to follow familiar patterns – yes, Labour will do very well in this week’s local elections. But under the surface, the tectonic plates that underpin the wider state continue to shift. The questions remains: if the Welsh aren’t going to be allowed to have what they want, what do they then do about it?

4/26/2022,"The owner of Primark has warned the clothing chain will have to raise prices on its autumn and winter ranges as it is no longer able to offset cost increases with savings. Associated British Foods (ABF) said its food businesses, which include Twinings, Kingsmill and Ryvita, face increasing inflationary pressure in many areas including raw materials, commodities, energy and supply chain costs made worse by the war in Ukraine. “We have not seen such a scale of inflation in our major markets in recent times,” the company said in its half-year statement issued on Tuesday. ABF said it expected profit margins would be hit by more than expected at both Primark and its food businesses over the coming months and it did not expect a recovery until next year. George Weston, the chief executive of ABF, said the group was taking measures to mitigate rising costs across the business but he added: “Looking further ahead, inflationary pressures are such that we are unable to offset them all with cost savings, and so Primark will implement selective price increases across some of the autumn/winter stock. However, we are committed to ensuring our price leadership and everyday affordability, especially in this environment of greater economic uncertainty.” The warning comes after Primark increased sales by 64% year on year to £3.5bn in the six months to 5 March, as it was able to keep nearly all its stores open throughout the period after a series of high street lockdowns around the world during the earlier stage of the pandemic. Primark said it had rung up strong sales of luggage and holiday kit such as swimwear and sandals as its customers began travelling for holidays again. Health and beauty sales also recovered, with false eyelashes and nails performing particularly well from the revival of socialising. However, sales for the period remained 10% below those before the pandemic. Despite rising cost pressures, operating profit margins returned to pre-Covid levels as shoppers flooded back to stores and it benefited from a favourable exchange rate with the dollar, which is used to pay many suppliers.",News/Business,Primark owner blames soaring costs as it warns of price rises,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/26/primark-rising-costs-price-rises-abf
4/26/2022,"Piers Morgan’s talkTV show Uncensored averaged 317,000 viewers during its first episode on Monday, as the television channel, owned by Rupert Murdoch, beat both Sky News and the BBC News channel during the same timeslot. The presenter’s heavily promoted return to television won a 2% share of all television viewing at 8pm, with the audience peaking at 397,000 as curious viewers checked out the new offering but didn’t stay around for the full hour. The new station, aided by an enormous advertising budget, was free of most of the technical issues which plagued last year’s launch of the right-wing GB News. Instead, viewers were treated to a heavily trailed interview with the former US president Donald Trump alongside a series of diatribes about “woke” policies, cancel culture and things you can’t say on television these days. Under the strapline of “straight talking starts here”, talkTV consists of three hours of new programming between 7pm and 10pm: Morgan’s programme, a news and political discussion show hosted by Tom Newton-Dunn, and a panel programme presented by Sharon Osborne. The rest of the station’s output consists of programmes that use the lineup of the former audio-only talkRadio. The initial ratings were marginally ahead of GB News’ launch night last year. Although talkTV’s ratings are likely to settle down over the coming weeks as the initial viewer curiosity wears off, the start suggests that there is an audience for a channel built around Morgan’s programme – which opened with a graphic of an exploding 3D brain with the words “woke insanity”, “snowflake society”, “the world’s gone mad” imposed over the top. Media analysts at Enders Analysis said the finances of the new station were unclear. They said talkTV is “unlikely to achieve the viewing levels required for stand-alone profitability in the midterm” but suggested that its influence on the media could be “disproportionate to its viewing levels”. The analysts said talkTV’s future will be partly shaped by whether clips go viral on social media: “People like to feel part of a broader conversation, and prefer it when that conversation is widely shared and impactful.” The launch of talkTV poses a serious threat to GB News, which has gradually rebuilt itself since a catastrophic launch but now faces being swamped by Murdoch’s slicker, more mainstream rival. Its viewing figures remain well below break-even level, while its television ratings are supported by Nigel Farage’s weekday evening show, which does well to hit 100,000 viewers.",News/Media,Piers Morgan’s talkTV show attracts the curious – who don’t stay the full hour,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/26/piers-morgan-talktv-trump-murdoch
4/26/2022,"For a visitor to this rural part of eastern Nebraska, the crisp air, blue skies and stretch of seemingly endless farm fields appear as unspoiled landscape. But for the people who live here, there is no denying this is an environmental disaster that researchers fear may affect generations to come. It has been just over a year since state regulators stepped in to close down the AltEn LLC ethanol plant on the outskirts of Mead, Nebraska, a small village of about 500 people near Omaha. The plant was found to be the source of huge quantities of toxic, pesticide-laced waste, which was stored in lagoons and piled into hills of a putrid lime-green mash. That waste then was accidentally spilled and intentionally spread throughout the area, including on to farm fields and into waterways that provide drinking water for people and wildlife several miles downstream. A monumental cleanup is under way that could cost perhaps $100m or more, according to Bill Thorson, the village board chairman. “The stench would be so bad your eyes would burn here in town,” Thorson said in a recent interview. “Let’s get this cleaned up.” Signs of the impact on this community are everywhere. A farmhouse has been abandoned by its owners after their young children experienced health problems; a pond once filled with fish and frogs is now empty of all life; university researchers are collecting blood and urine from residents to analyze them for contaminants. A family miles away from the plant said they now only drink water from plastic bottles because tests show chemical contamination of their drinking well. “We want it back to what it was,” resident Stan Keiser told the Guardian. “That shouldn’t be too much to ask.” Crews of environmental engineers are filtering millions of gallons of water through newly constructed treatment units and adopting techniques seen at some US Superfund sites to contain and control the waste. The measures include the use of a helicopter to drop a temporary, protective shell-like coating of cement, fiber and clay over 16 acres of waste piles. Questions about how best to move forward have divided this community of about 500 people. Some are calling for the federal Environmental Protection Agency to declare a Superfund site in Mead, while others say such a move would only add to costs and bureaucracy and depress property values. State regulators plan to hold a public hearing in the Mead high school gymnasium on 27 April as part of an effort to listen to concerns. Regulators are also providing “information and updates” to the community on a designated webpage on the cleanup. The regulators say they are inspecting the site three times a week to try to prevent further escape of toxins. Researchers, however, say it is not clear if or how all the damage can be erased, and the situation underscores how difficult – perhaps impossible – it is to truly escape contamination from pesticides and other chemicals that are becoming pervasive in our environment, and answer questions about the health impacts. “We are using and releasing more chemicals into the environment than ever before, and know very little about long-term effects from exposure,” said Daniel Snow, an environmental chemist and director of the water sciences laboratory at the University of Nebraska. The trouble at AltEn traces back to a strategy that defied normal industry practices. AltEn advised large seed companies that they could rid themselves of unwanted stocks of corn seed and other types of seeds coated with highly concentrated amounts of fungicides and insecticides by “recycling” them for use in AltEn’s production of biofuel. These treated seeds are widely used by farmers to try to protect crops from insects and disease but are seen by environmental advocates as detrimental and unnecessary. The seed coatings on the products disposed of at AltEn contained concentrated amounts of several pesticides that are known as neonicotinoids, or “neonics”, which can have neurotoxic effects on people and animals. Neonicotinoids are used across on an estimated 150m acres of US farmland, and scientific research has shown they are contributing to a decline in important pollinators such as honeybees. While some countries have banned certain neonics, the US government has proposed allowing extended use. So while the strategy gave AltEn supplies for its ethanol, it also left the plant with toxic wastewater and more than 80,000 pounds of a pesticide-laden solid byproduct or “wet cake”, mounded in piles around the plant property. State officials recorded the neonic pesticides in AltEn waste at levels many times higher than what is considered safe. For the neonic known as clothianidin the regulatory benchmark is 11 parts per billion, but AltEn waste contained clothianidin at 427,000 parts per billion, for instance, according to state records. Regulatory documents show that plant operators spread some of the waste materials on area farm fields and more flowed off the AltEn property through a series of events that included heavy rains and a ruptured pipe. Regulators finally closed down the plant in early 2021. AltEn’s former operators, who are also now being sued by the Nebraska attorney general for multiple alleged environmental violations, could not be reached for comment. Lawyers for AltEn also did not respond to a request for comment. Six of the world’s largest seed companies have filed lawsuits against AltEn, alleging plant operators violated contracts and failed to dispose of the chemically treated seeds safely. The companies, which include the Monsanto owner Bayer AG and Chinese-owned Syngenta, are paying for and organizing the cleanup effort through a coalition they call the AltEn Facility Response Group (AFRG). In its lawsuit against AltEn, Syngenta alleges that plant operators left the property with “significant environmental risks” that included “thousands of tons of untreated wet cake on the property in improperly managed and inadequately secured piles” and “lagoons overfilled with wastewater and in risk of failing”. Along with covering the toxin-filled wet cake with the temporary shell, contractors hired by AFRG have constructed a new lined pond system on the AltEn site, treated 14m gallons of wastewater, and have started disposing of the treated water by applying it to area fields, among other measures. They are not yet sure how to dispose of the wet cake, but are analyzing options, according to Don Gunster, a project coordinator with NewFields environmental consulting firm, which is working for the AFRG alongside other engineering and scientific firms specializing in environmental cleanups. “Our efforts are starting to make an important difference at the site,” Gunster said. A top priority is “ensuring the safety of the surrounding community and environment while addressing the site conditions caused by AltEn”, he said. Ray and Emily Loftus abandoned their dream home, only half a mile away from AltEn, after their youngest child started having respiratory problems and they determined the old farmhouse with the big yard was too close to the plant to be safe for their family of four. The property now sits vacant, a child’s ball still resting in the grass near a swing set moved now only by the breeze. A few miles downstream from AltEn, Stan Keiser and his wife drink only bottled water after AltEn contaminants were found in their well, and they are both saddened and infuriated by the flow of toxic wastewater that they say has wiped all signs of life from the four-acre farm pond. Testing of the pond water, sediment and private well all showed evidence of pesticide contamination. Their daughter Amy Whitehead can’t forget the sight of the dead beavers and a small dead fox she found near the water after a burst pipe at AltEn sent foul-smelling foamy wastewater flowing on to the Keiser property. The fish died long before that, just about a year after AltEn started using the pesticide-coated seeds. The farm has been in her family since 1911, and she hopes her children can one day live and play on the land without risk. But she worries that may not be possible any time soon. “I worry about the water,” Whitehead said. “It’s not clean. It just seems dead.” Keiser used to enjoy fishing with his wife and running grandkids around the pond in a paddleboat, but now the couple has dismantled the dock and they keep their distance from the water. In a letter sent to state regulators in February, the Keisers said concerns over the condition of their drinking water persist. They want routine testing of their well water, and a filtration system put in place for their home and livestock water needs. They also want their pond water removed and treated, the sediment removed, and a new liner installed. “We just want to make these people accountable,” Stan Keiser said of AltEn. “They knew what they were doing.” Even as the experts race to detoxify the AltEn wastewater storage lagoons, researchers say contaminated water has already moved far from Mead, potentially even into the aquifer that supplies water for cities and towns throughout the region. More could be leaching into the environment under the unlined piles of wet cake, they fear. Airborne transmission is also a possible culprit as some of the waste was incinerated by AltEn operators before the shutdown. Researchers from the University of Nebraska Medical School are launching a study to try to assess if there are any long-term health impacts from the contamination. They will soon start collecting blood and urine from people in the area looking for pesticide contamination, and they have set up an online human health survey to gather more information. Researchers with the University of Nebraska and Creighton University are also testing animals and taking samples of water, soil and air. To truly understand the impacts on human and environmental health will take several years and up to $8m, they say. “We think that some of the human health consequences of this are not going to show up in a few days, they are going to show up maybe in a few years,” said Eleanor Rogan, interim chair of the department of health promotion, College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Rogan and other researchers said they had run into multiple roadblocks, including opposition from the agricultural industry and many state lawmakers. The research, which underscores the hazards that come with the chemically treated seeds, is being deemed as “anti-business”, according to University of Nebraska research scientist Judy Wu-Smart. The legislature rejected a $10m funding proposal for the university research into AltEn impacts, approving instead $1m. If other funds are not found, the work will have to be curtailed, according to Rogan. Carol Blood, a Democrat in the Nebraska legislature, is one lawmaker who supports the research and wants an investigation into the regulatory handling of AltEn. Blood is now running for governor, promising to put an end to “secrecy” surrounding AltEn issues. “We want to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” said Blood. “We don’t know if someone in grade school now may not be able to have children when they grow up because of this. People may get cancer, people may get sick. We don’t want people to think that Mead is a bad place to live and raise a family. But it’s about having clean air to breathe and clean water to drink.” This story is co-published with The New Lede, a journalism project of the Environmental Working Group",News/Environment,‘We want it back to what it was’: the US village blighted by toxic waste,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/26/pollution-mead-nebraska-pesticide-waste
4/26/2022,"Strangeness is a quality valued and yearned for in so many sorts of movies, but rarely found – yet this really is strange, an experiment in horror form from the trans film-maker Jane Schoenbrun and executive-produced by David Lowery. It draws on a video-art aesthetic, a gamer aesthetic and a lockdown Zoom aesthetic, taking us to a world where liberation goes hand-in-hand with loneliness. It’s very unnerving and a little bit exhausting. Newcomer Anna Cobb plays Casey, a teen who is about to take the World’s Fair Challenge; that is, to take part in an occult horror online game, immerse herself in the fantasy roleplay, and upload videos documenting the supposed changes in herself triggered by the game. This she duly does, along with other players, and it is these disjointed existences and worlds which provide the film’s drama of alienation. The movie begins with a genuinely disturbing extended shot of Casey’s face bathed in an unearthly glow, as it were from the laptop’s POV, as she gazes into the screen, submitting to the game’s mesmeric and unwholesome rituals. She makes contact with a World’s Fair veteran, JLB (Michael J Rogers), who reaches out to Casey, professing admiration for her videos, and offering to decode the game’s mysteries. Is he Virgil to her Dante? Or some sort of predator? There are no in-person dialogue scenes in this film: it shows us an atomised world, everyone alone in a weirdly untenanted universe, like the survivors of some terrible apocalypse or neutron bomb that kills people yet leaves buildings upright and the traffic moving. Who is Casey anyway? Hasn’t she got schoolwork to do? We hear (but don’t see) her dad, who at one point yells at her from outside her bedroom door at 3am for making too much noise.

4/26/2022,"Acertain weariness came over me at the prospect of this adaptation of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World; I’m not much in the mood for dystopian doom and gloom right now. But I was wrong to be chary: this is a book that will keep your bedside light burning long into the night. Fred Fordham’s retelling of Huxley’s 1932 novel is so sleek, owing more to the movies than to its original author’s prose – his subtly futuristic illustrations may bring to mind Fritz Lang or even Steven Spielberg (think Minority Report) – and, thanks to this, two things happen. First, the narrative fairly rips along. Second, the novel’s terrible prescience is pushed to the fore, the parallels between Huxley’s imaginary future and our own present suddenly so close, it’s almost painful at moments. You know the story. “Everybody’s happy now,” insist the citizens of Huxley’s utopian world state – and it’s almost true. In this benumbed realm, physical pain and old age have been eradicated and familial and emotional attachments have disappeared; in place of passion, there is a drug called soma, which promises sexual oblivion. A few human beings, known as Savages, who were born the old-fashioned way, and retain memories of such banned books as the Bible and Shakespeare, are still to be found living in “reservations”, like zoo animals. But everyone else came into being thanks to genetic engineering, bred in bottles and processed into standard adults in uniform batches. The only threat to this sterility is the upper caste, who run things. One member of this caste, Bernard Marx, experiences a restlessness and ennui that threatens to imperil the status quo. Marx goes on holiday to a Savage reservation in New Mexico and returns with two humans: Linda, the long-lost lover of the Director of Hatcheries, and her son, John, born after a regular pregnancy and raised on Shakespeare. They are, of course, considered freaks in London, but this doesn’t mean that John’s rebellion at what he finds there has no effect. The consequences of the horror he sees all around him will have powerful and far-reaching consequences. Fordham, best known to me as the illustrator of Philip Pullman’s first graphic novel, The Adventures of John Blake, has worked miracles here. Lots (too many) of classic novel adaptations come my way these days and they’re almost always disappointing: lumbering beasts that are not half as good as the books on which they’re based. But this one really works. Fordham never loses sight of the central message of Brave New World – if life is to be fully lived, Huxley tells us, it will always involve some pain – but he also knows how comics work and this book is first and foremost a comic. I said that it brought to mind the movies, but if I’m really honest, his faces and his interiors take me straight back to my childhood, when I pretty much lived for my weekly Bunty (I mean this as a compliment, in case you’re wondering). Their retro styling is superbly dynamic: every frame full of adventure or pathos, or both.  Brave New World by Fred Fordham is published by Vintage Classics (£20).

4/26/2022,"Good morning. Russia’s foreign minister has accused Nato of fighting a proxy war by supplying military aid to Ukraine, as defence ministers gathered in Germany for US-hosted talks on supporting Ukraine through what one US general called a “very critical” few weeks. Sergei Lavrov told Russian state media: “Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.” He also warned that the risks of nuclear conflict were now “considerable” – a claim Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said showed Moscow had lost its “last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine”. When asked about the importance of avoiding a third world war, Lavrov said: “I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real. And we must not underestimate it.” Where are the talks happening? The US talks, hosted in Germany by the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, are expected to see more than 40 countries and the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, gather at Ramstein airbase south-west of Frankfurt. What will be discussed? Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said a key goal of the talks was to coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that included heavy weaponry, such as howitzers, as well as armed drones and ammunition. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 62 of the invasion. Elon Musk has reached a $44bn deal to buy Twitter in a takeover that will give the world’s richest man control of a social network with more than 200 million users. The sale will put the Tesla chief executive in charge of a company that he has frequently criticized, claiming it has not lived up to its potential as a platform for “free speech”. The deal yesterday comes after a dramatic few weeks of speculation about Twitter’s future, triggered by Musk’s emergence as the platform’s largest single shareholder on 4 April. He then declared a takeover bid on 14 April, offering to buy all Twitter’s shares for $54.20 each. At first, Twitter’s board seemed opposed, enacting an anti-takeover measure known as a poison pill that could have made a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive. But its initial reluctance to accept a transaction appeared to fade after Musk confirmed a funding package for the deal – including $21bn of his own money, alongside debt funding from Morgan Stanley and other financial institutions – and shareholders warmed to it. What has Musk said? “Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” he said. “Twitter has tremendous potential – I look forward to working with the company and users to unlock it.” What has Twitter’s chief executive, Parag Agrawal, said? “Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world. Deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important,” he said in a tweet. Days before Joe Biden’s presidential inauguration, Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene appeared in a text to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to press for Donald Trump to overturn his 2020 election defeat by invoking martial law, new messages show. The message – one of more than 2,000 texts turned over by Meadows to the House select committee investigating January 6 and first reported by CNN – shows that some of Trump’s most ardent allies on Capitol Hill were pressing for Trump to return himself to office even after the Capitol attack. “In our private chat with only Members several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call Marshall [sic] law,” Greene texted. “I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next.” When was the message sent? The message about Trump potentially invoking martial law was sent on 17 January and came a month after the idea had been raised in a heated Oval Office meeting a month before, where Trump considered ways to overturn the 2020 election.

It has been just over a year since state regulators stepped in to close down the AltEn LLC ethanol plant on the outskirts of Mead, Nebraska. The plant was found to be the source of huge quantities of toxic, pesticide-laced waste, which was accidentally spilled and intentionally spread throughout the area. A monumental cleanup is under way that could cost perhaps $100m or more, according to Bill Thorson, the village board chairman. “The stench would be so bad your eyes would burn here in town,” Thorson said. It is the latest revival from the carefree early 00s to brave the fire-scorched hellscape of the 21st century, writes Zoe Williams. The relationship between Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez, AKA Bennifer, has roared back with a vengeance, with Lopez announcing their re-engagement this month, almost 19 years after they called off their wedding. They aren’t the only ones. Why do some pairings work better the second time around? The number of coal-fired power plants under development around the world fell last year, but far too much coal is still being burned and too many new coal-fired power plants are planned for the world to stay within safe temperature limits and a slowdown in older coal-fired power stations being taken out of service. The authors of the report concluded that “coal’s last gasp is not yet in sight”, despite countries agreeing at the Cop26 UN climate summit last November to a “phasedown” of coal.

4/26/2022,"In his award-winning novels My Cat Yugoslavia and Crossing, Kosovan-born Pajtim Statovci explored love in a homophobic society, fractured identity and exile – his family fled to Finland when he was two. He covers similar ground in his third novel Bolla, deftly translated by David Hackston, although this book feels considerably darker. In 1995 Pristina, Arsim, an Albanian who dreams of becoming a writer, meets and falls for Miloš, a Serbian medical student. Chapters alternate between their two narratives. Arsim is married to Ajshe and deeply resentful of the loveless marriage orchestrated by his father “because a man… is expected to reproduce and continue the family tree”. When Ajshe dutifully becomes pregnant he beats her. By contrast, the two men cannot enjoy an open relationship. According to Arsim: “Our time together is mostly silent and the curtains are always closed. We never go anywhere, not even for a walk, we don’t harbour thoughts of any kind outside this apartment because such a life simply doesn’t exist.” War eventually tears them apart. Arsim and his family are forced into exile, while Miloš enlists as a soldier. Arsim finds it hard to adapt to his new life. When he has sex with a male minor, he is charged with rape, imprisoned for 13 months and afterwards deported back to Pristina. Miloš’s experience is equally unhappy. His fragmented diary entries, dated from January 2000 to April 2002, recall an abusive childhood and war’s “wreckage”, as well as his meeting with Arsim and their brief happiness together. Throughout, Statovci interweaves the story of the Bolla, a mythological beast born from the union between a snake and God’s daughter. The Albanian word also means “alien” and “invisible”. Hiding in its cave, Statovci suggests, the Bolla represents forbidden desire in the eyes of an unforgiving society. By the end, Miloš is so broken that he envies the beast its one day of freedom every year. Bolla is a stark, powerful portrayal of the dehumanising effects of trauma, shame and fear.  Bolla by Pajtim Statovci, translated by David Hackston, is published by Faber (£14.99). To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.

4/26/2022,"A prepublication version of the first Harry Potter book by JK Rowling is expected to fetch at least £20,000 when it is auctioned this week. The galley proof (a publishing term for the printed version of a book before its final proofread) is the only known surviving copy of its kind. A first edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone signed by Rowling is also up for auction and is expected to sell for at least £25,000. The bundle of galley sheets, to be sold by Chiswick Auctions, consists of 109 pages. Accompanying the advance copy of Philosopher’s Stone are letters from 1997, the year of the book’s publication, showing correspondence between Rosamund Walker, then marketing manager at Bloomsbury Children’s Books (now Rosamund de la Hey, co-owner of independent bookshop The Mainstreet Trading Company), and children’s book reviewer Fiona Waters. The lot, which will be part of the auction house’s Fine Books & Works on Paper sale on 28 April, has been estimated at £20,000-£30,000. Dated 26 February 1997, the letter from Walker accompanying the galley sheets – which are laid out as the final version of the book would be – describes the plot of the book, with Walker writing: “The story then develops into an excellent knockabout tale of school capers with goodies and baddies … I simply loved it – pacy, funny, imaginative, clever and the characters are wonderfully vivid.” In a response dated 28 March 1997, Waters wrote: “I just loved this book … There is something about Harry Potter that reminds me of Charlie Bucket in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the put upon nice guy making good.” Waters also said that the team at Bloomsbury had to get the book’s jacket right “if it is going to be picked up”, and asked for a finished copy as she “would like to tell lots of people about it”. Waters’ quote was used on the back of the first edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone. Clive Moss, head of Chiswick Auctions printed books and manuscripts said: “We are delighted to be able to offer such a fascinating insight into what was to become an iconic work in the history of literature. This copy is not mentioned in the definitive bibliography by Philip W Errington, which records all of the activity of the works of JK Rowling. Therefore, these are the only known surviving set of galley sheets that have been seen, or offered for sale on the open market.” Also going on sale at the auction is a signed first edition paperback of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, which is accompanied by a letter of authenticity from Harry Potter specialist Adam Houston. The book is estimated to fetch between £25,000 and £28,000. A set of first editions of all seven UK Harry Potter titles is to be sold by the auction house too, all of which are signed on the title page by Rowling and in excellent condition. The set is accompanied by a note on Rowling-headed paper explaining that this signed set has been donated by Rowling to be used for a fundraising auction in aid of the charity BSF. The set is estimated to sell for between £26,000 and £28,000. The lots have been donated by different people for a “variety of reasons”, said Moss. “Some have realised that they are holding an item of value, some feel the market for them is right, another wants it to help towards a property purchase. Rowling’s Harry Potter novels are a phenomenon that keeps on giving and helping people in many ways”. Also part of the sale will be a complete set of first edition James Bond novels by Ian Fleming, estimated to fetch between £40,000 and £60,000.",Arts/Books,"Rare proof sheets of first Harry Potter book expected to sell for £20,000",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/26/rare-proof-sheets-of-first-harry-potter-book-expected-to-sell-for-20000
4/26/2022,"Finally, we have arrived. We’re on the most cursed timeline, where the man who once paid $20m for a single bad tweet now owns Twitter. Elon Musk has spent $44bn – half of which is his own money – to take over the social media platform where #AmberTurd regularly trends. This news has prompted a mass exodus as believable as that time in 2016 when all American liberals were apparently moving to Canada. But how surprised can we be that the idiot’s favourite smart guy has forked out so much for control over public discourse? This is the man who has repeatedly inveigled his way into pop culture, turning up in everything from South Park to Iron Man 2, in his desperation to reinvent himself as a celebrity. Musk is truly the people’s billionaire, in that he has billions of dollars and he’s not a Russian oligarch no one had ever heard of before February. Celebrity cameos are like soft diplomacy: we’re a Pacific island and Musk is the BBC World Service. Except Musk isn’t a celebrity, even if he shares their fondness for thin women and secret babies: he’s a rich man who has put great amounts of time and energy in confecting his own image. By Musk’s telling, he ‘twas but an ‘umble street urchin with a talent for coding; his father, Errol, who at one point co-owned a Zambian emerald mine, once said: “We had so much money at times we couldn’t even close our safe.” And like a man who might have a complex about having a really full safe and an African emerald mine in the family, Musk has worked for years to make himself the guy who pokes fun at how rich, smart and kind he is. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning “I’ve got an idea for an electric jet,” he tells Tony Stark in his 10-second scene in Iron Man 2, billionaire playboy to billionaire playboy. Director Jon Favreau once praised Musk for letting him film at SpaceX for nothing: as if having superhero film made in your office was pure generosity on Musk’s part, and not an enormous ego boost for a guy who has the energy of both the most divorced man and the most bullied child. (On that note, check out the dedicated Wikipedia page for Donald Trump’s cameos.) In South Park, Musk gives Cartman a tour of SpaceX. In Rick and Morty he plays Elon Tusk, a tech billionaire who – wait for it – has tusks and is from – wait for it – “the Tusk Dimension” and works for – yeah – Tuskla. (The show is much better and smarter than that would have you believe.) In The Big Bang Theory, he’s shown volunteering in a shelter at Thanksgiving. “It feels great to come here and help the less fortunate,” says the man who once offered to end world hunger if the UN tell him “exactly how” his billions would be spent – and then didn’t respond when they did. But perhaps the most fawning example is his Simpsons episode: season 26’s The Musk Who Fell to Earth, which is truly all his, because how else to explain why this episode exists? In it Musk is introduced as “the man who’s revolutionized the car industry.” “Henry Ford!” exclaims Mr Burns. “Good to see you, as healthy and vibrant as Detroit itself!” Musk then goes on to use Burns’ money to – you guessed it – try to save the world. Longtime Simpsons producer Al Jean – who uploaded a photo of himself beaming alongside Musk on Tuesday – said the episode, which Musk helped script, wasn’t “kiss ass” because “Burns tries to kill him, and we reveal Musk’s master password”. That password is MUSKRULZ. Ahoho! Good thing Musk has experience dealing with exploding batteries, how else would he cope with such a blistering burn? But it is all for nothing. Because nothing in a script will be funnier than the time he tried to demonstrate how strong the glass on the Tesla Cybertruck was by having a guy smash right through it in front of a crowd. Or the time he made a April fool’s joke about Tesla going bankrupt and share prices tanked. Elon, you’re a billionaire! We’ll always be fascinated by your various planes and thoughts about pyramids.

4/26/2022,"The Seven Network was paying the legal fees of several SAS witnesses for Ben Roberts-Smith in his defamation trial until one of them revealed the payments in the federal court, contradicting Seven’s claim last week that the former soldier’s evidence about the source of the payments was “not correct”. When the former SAS soldier, known as Person 5, told the court last week that his solicitor and barrister are being paid for by Seven, the network said another arm of the empire owned by Seven West Media chair, Kerry Stokes, was footing the bill. A spokesperson for the Seven Network told Guardian Australia last Thursday “the claim the Seven Network are paying the legal fees is not correct”, but said the fees were being “reimbursed” by another arm of the Stokes empire. “The fees were reimbursed by ACE [Australian Capital Equity], the chair’s private company,” the spokesperson said. “The chairman felt it was unfair that soldiers were being brought before the inquiry without representation.” On Tuesday a spokesperson for Stokes confirmed Seven asked for ACE to repay that expenditure and assume those debts after the evidence was heard in court last week. The Seven Network is owned by Stokes, who is footing the legal bill for Roberts-Smith, who was the general manager of 7Queensland and Seven Brisbane before he stepped down to focus on the trial 12 months ago. Roberts-Smith remains a Seven employee and his legal costs have been covered by a $1.87m loan from Seven, which was repaid by ACE. The court heard on Tuesday that the request for reimbursement was not made to Stokes’s private company until after Seven’s legal financing was revealed in court. Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The court heard last week the Seven Network was billed almost $170,000 for the legal costs of three witnesses who are testifying on behalf of Roberts-Smith over nearly two years. Person 5’s legal bills amounted to more than $65,000, including for the examination and evaluation of photographs of the Whiskey 108 compound. Two other soldier witnesses set to be called by Roberts-Smith, Person 33 and Person 11, have also had their legal bills paid for by Seven. All serving and former soldiers called before this trial are entitled to legal representation paid for by the defence department. Earlier this month Stokes stepped down from his role as chair and member of the council of the Australian War Memorial after 15 years.

4/26/2022,"Yorta Yorta woman Veronica Marie Nelson made repeated calls for assistance in the hours before she was found dead in a maximum security prison cell, a coronial inquest has heard. The 37-year-old, who also has Gunditjmara, Dja Dja Wurrung and Wiradjuri heritage, died at the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre on 2 January 2020, four days after being arrested because she had failed to attend a sentencing hearing for a shoplifting offence. Recordings from the prison intercom system were played in the opening address of a five-week inquest into her death which began in the Melbourne coroner’s court on Tuesday. In the recordings, Nelson can be heard crying in pain and telling prison officers, “I need help, I am cramping something shocking”. In the last recorded call for assistance, she is crying so loudly that the prison officer warns her to be quiet, in case she wakes up other prisoners. Nelson was arrested on 30 December 2019 outside Southern Cross station and denied bail by police. On 31 December she represented herself at a bail hearing at the magistrates court. A duty lawyer for Victorian Legal Aid spoke to her prior to the hearing but did not represent her. The court refused to release Nelson under the state’s strict bail laws, and she was taken to the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre. The council assisting coroner Simon McGregor, Sharon Lacy, said the inquest will examine the state’s bail laws as well as the quality of supervision and medical care Nelson received while in prison. An autopsy listed Nelson’s cause of death as complications of Wilke’s syndrome in a setting of acute opiate withdrawal – a condition which can cause pain, nausea and severe vomiting, which can lead to fatal electrolyte imbalances. “She may have passed of natural causes, but if it could have been avoided, it should have been,” said Lacy. In her opening address Lacy outlined the events leading up to Nelson’s death. Nelson was severely underweight – weighing just 33kg – and had been vomiting regularly since she arrived at Dame Phyllis Frost Centre, on the afternoon of 1 January 2020, Lacy said. Lacy said a nurse who completed her initial health exam said she was “very concerned”. The doctor who saw Nelson at the same time said she “looked generally well”, Lacy said. He gave her a rapid withdrawal pack, which included nausea medication and drugs to assist with opiate withdrawal. Nelson was held in the medical ward overnight where she vomited repeatedly and made numerous requests for help on the intercom to prison officers. She was brought a drink at 7am and began reporting bad cramps at 7.31am. She made 10 more requests between 7.30am and 10.15am, asking for a drink and to see the doctor. The court heard audio of a prison guard telling her at 10.15am: “It’s not an emergency. Stop asking.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning That afternoon she was transferred to the Yarra unit. Her cell was locked down at 7pm. Lacy said Nelson was heard “screaming out in pain” from 9pm until after 4am, when she suddenly stopped. At 1.37am, Lacy said a nurse gave Nelson some paracetamol and a Maxolon tablet, an anti-nausea medication. The nurse later told coronial investigators that she had to prise Nelson’s fingers open to place the tablets in her hand, because “they were cramped into a claw”. Between 2am and 4am, Nelson made repeated calls on the intercom to prison officers saying she was “cramping badly”. On the second last call, at 3.56am, a prison officer suggested she take a shower and said: “Ms Nelson you need to try to stop because you are keeping the other prisoners awake.” On the last call, at 3.58am, the prison officer asks Nelson if she would like to go to the hospital ward. Nelson, who is crying on the call, says: “I want to stay here.” At 7.50am prison officers opened Nelson’s cell door because she had not responded to the morning roll call. She was found naked on the floor, in the foetal position, with her hands “clenched like claws,” Lacy said. The shower was running and the cell was flooded. A code black medical emergency was called, but the prison nurses who responded said it appeared Nelson had been dead “for quite some time”. Nelson’s partner of 20 years, Percy Lovett, told the court that Nelson was a very strong and private person. “She wouldn’t have been crying out like that, especially to the officers, unless something was really wrong,” he said. Lovett said Nelson was “one of a kind,” and losing her had only got harder as the years had gone on. Nelson is one of 505 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to die in custody since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody handed down its final report in 1991. Five of those deaths occurred this year. Lacy said preventing further deaths in custody was a key aim of the inquest. The inquest scope includes the examination of systemic issues, including whether Nelson’s status as an Aboriginal woman and a drug addict affected the way she was treated by the justice system. It will also look at issues of remand and bail, which Lacy said disproportionately affect Aboriginal women. As of 1 June last year, 61.4% of all Aboriginal women in custody in Victoria were on remand, meaning they had not been convicted and sentenced to jail on the offence for which they were in custody. “[Nelson’s] offending had never given rise to a sentence of imprisonment, but she had been held on remand three times,” Lacy said. Nelson’s mother, Aunty Donna Nelson, told the court that while preventing similar deaths must be a priority, her focus was on seeking justice for her “daughter, best friend and sister”. “The lessons learned from this inquest must stop my people from dying in custody,” Aunty Donna Nelson told the court. “But let’s not lose focus. This inquest is first and foremost about Veronica, and how a broken criminal justice system locked my daughter up to die even when she was crying for help over and over.”",News/Australia news,"Veronica Nelson made repeated calls for help before her death in custody, inquest hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/veronica-nelson-made-repeated-calls-for-help-before-her-death-in-custody-inquest-hears
4/26/2022,"Take it from the president at Saint Peter’s himself: Life has not quite returned to normal at the tiny Jersey City university, whose basketball team stunned the sports world in March by becoming the first No 15 seed in history to reach the NCAA tournament’s Elite Eight. “This may sound crazy,” Eugene J Cornacchia tells the Guardian, referring to the student body, “but they seem to be walking with more confidence, more spring in their step.” The most obvious effect was on the players, who went from competing in front of a few hundred fans to being broadcast to millions across America. “We generated a lot of publicity for our school,” Daryl Banks III, the Peacocks’ junior guard who transferred this week to St Bonaventure, said after the loss to North Carolina. “So it’s just going to help the school out in general. Caught the attention of everybody who wants to come here. I think just what we did will have an impact on everybody who knows about the school now.” The unexpected injection of good vibrations was a wonderful aftereffect, of course, but, perhaps more important in the long-term, the school’s coffers have been given a big jolt, too – and not just because Saint Peter’s is selling more $22 Peacocks T-shirts at its online merchandise store. More people are donating money to the school. Cornacchia has a juicy stat: Between 9 and 26 March 2021, a year before Saint Peter’s historic NCAA run, the university received 149 “gifts” totaling $475,000. In the same timeframe this year, as the Peacocks beat college basketball giants such as Kentucky and Purdue, the school received 414 gifts totaling $2.3m. “I wish they could do this every year,” Cornacchia says, laughing. He says, “A lot of people just sent money in – they didn’t designate it for anything.” The Peacocks had to win the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference tournament just to qualify for the NCAA tournament, then were handed the 15th of 16 seeds in the East Regional and a first-round game against the No 2 seed, the eight-time national champions Kentucky (annual basketball budget: $20m). “This is St Peter’s first NCAA tournament appearance since 2011, where it lost to Purdue by 22 points as a No 13 seed,” Yahoo Sports sniffed before the Kentucky game. “Don’t expect a better showing this time around.” Well, the Peacocks beat Kentucky (student body: 30,500) in overtime, then eliminated Murray State (student body: 9,500) and the No 3 seed, Purdue (student body: 50,000), before falling to North Carolina, who went on to reach the tournament final. As a result, the Peacocks won over a lot of fans, and not just locally. According to the university, its licensing partner – which sells school merchandise – reported more than $300,000 in sales in the two weeks after the Peacocks upset Kentucky. In the first eight months of the fiscal year, which started last July, the school’s licensing partner reported $58,813 in sales. Saint Peter’s marked $47,000 in sales on campus from 17-24 March, with $15,000 in merchandise sold on 24 March, the day before the Purdue game, alone. These numbers overwhelm the $20,000 in similar sales on campus during the fall semester, from September to December. During the weekend of 19 March (just after the team shocked Kentucky), Trevco, which sells sports merchandise on Amazon, told the school that Saint Peter’s was its top selling institution with over $40,000 in sales. “Whether people will continue to wear them down the line, I don’t know,” Cornacchia said of the merchandise bonanza. “But I hope so.” Additionally, word about Saint Peter’s has spread. The attention the school received on so-called “free media” was estimated to be worth between $125m and $150m, Cornacchia says. During the week of 12 March, search terms for Saint Peter’s on Amazon were comparable to the biggest college football teams in the run-up to their seasons. A week later they were comparable to Alabama, a football team that generates $95m a year in revenue. Those who just happened to catch a Peacocks’ game tended to like what they saw. Cornacchia tells the story of watching the Peacocks play Murray State in Indianapolis. Some non-Peacocks fans found seats in front of Cornacchia and were soon talking about how impressed they were with Saint Peter’s. Cornacchia introduced himself. A pleasant conversation followed, and one of the fans promised Cornacchia that he would write a check to the school for $2,800. “I have no idea why he came up with that amount,” Cornacchia says. He says Saint Peter’s alumni have “been electrified by this moment.” Despite its location in the New York metropolitan area, the school was not that well known before the tournament, even among high school basketball players who wanted to play in college. Cornacchia says an alumni reception was held recently in Bergen county, about 20 miles north of Jersey City. An event like that usually draws 25 to 30 people, he said. This one drew more than 70. Exactly how all of the fanfare boosts applications and enrollment won’t become clear until a year or two from now, Cornacchia says, although the school’s international graduate business program has attracted additional interest from Japan, Italy and India. “Nothing we can do, barring the Nobel Prize for something amazing medically, gets the attention this does,” he says. Prior to this season, Saint Peter’s with a gift from a major donor had renovated its drab and outdated 3,200-seat gymnasium into a bright facility called the Run Baby Run Arena, named after the 1968 Saint Peter’s team that upset Duke in the National Invitation Tournament. Some donations may be earmarked to update the Yanitelli Center, which surrounds the arena. It is likely donations will also go to non-sports facilities although the school has not broken down its exact spending plans. There have been losses though. To no one’s surprise Shaheen Holloway, the coach who masterminded Saints Peter’s run, left the school a day after the Peacocks lost to North Carolina. Holloway took the head coaching job 11 miles away at Seton Hall, a Big East Conference school (with a larger athletic budget) at which Holloway played and graduated. But Saint Peter’s was on guard. On April 12, the school hired Bashir Mason, a Jersey City native who was coaching at Wagner College on nearby Staten Island, to replace Holloway. Mason is just 38, and he coached Wagner to within one victory of the 2022 NCAA tournament. The tournament has also built unexpected connections. Cornacchia says he received an email from the president of Oral Roberts University, William Wilson, congratulating the school on the run and inviting him to give him a call when the tournament was over. Oral Roberts, a 4,000-student Evangelical institution in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was the Cinderella team in the 2021 NCAA tournament, also entering as a No 15 seed before upsetting No 2 Ohio State and No 7 Florida to make it to the Sweet 16. ORU lost in the Elite Eight to Arkansas – on a basket with three seconds left. The Peacocks would win that round in 2022. “It was interesting,” Cornacchia says of his conversation with Wilson. “His take was that this is a special moment – but don’t lose sight of the fact that it doesn’t last forever – unless you invest in it.” ",Sport/Sport,‘People just sent money in’: What happened after St Peter’s basketball fairytale?,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/26/people-just-sent-money-in-what-happened-after-st-peters-basketball-fairytale
