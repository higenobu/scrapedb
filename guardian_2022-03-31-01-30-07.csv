3/31/2022,"Eight Russian oligarchs on the UK sanctions list over their links to Vladimir Putin were granted “golden visas” to live in Britain. The eight individuals, who Boris Johnson described as having “the blood of the Ukrainian people on their hands”, were granted the right to live in the UK after promising to invest at least £2m under the controversial tier 1 investor visa scheme. Lady Williams of Trafford, a home office minister, said in an answer to a parliamentary question this week that on 18 March, eight of the oligarchs subjected to sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine “had been identified as holding or having held leave as a tier 1 (investor) migrant or as a tier 1 (investor) migrant dependent”. The eight people were not named, and the Home Office declined to provide further details. On 10 March, the UK government said sanctions had been imposed on 18 Russian businesspeople, with a combined worth of £30bn, since the invasion began. Hundreds more have been added to the list since. Those on the list include Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea FC; Alisher Usmanov, the steel and mining magnate described by the EU as one of Putin’s “favourite oligarchs”; and Andrey Guryev Jr, whose family reportedly owns Witanhurst, a mansion in Highgate, north London, that is London’s second-largest home after Buckingham Palace. Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson, said: “For too long the government has rolled out the red carpet for Putin’s cronies. These people should never have been able to buy their way into the UK with ill-gotten wealth. “We now need to know how many others who were given golden visas owe their wealth to Putin’s regime, and why the government hasn’t sanctioned them too. Ministers must stop dragging their feet and finally publish the review into these visas.” The government scrapped the golden visa scheme in February as fears mounted that Russia was preparing to invade Ukraine. Priti Patel, the home secretary, said she was closing the scheme as part of a push to stop “corrupt elites who threaten our national security and push dirty money around our cities”. Launched in 2008, the scheme allowed people with at least £2m in investment funds and a UK bank account to apply for residency rights, along with their family. The speed with which applicants were given indefinite leave to remain was hastened by how much money they planned to invest in the UK: £2m took five years, while £10m shortened the wait to two. The Home Office has issued 2,581 investor visas to Russian citizens since the scheme was introduced in 2008. During a “blind faith period” between 2008 and 2015, 97% of investors were subject to scant checks on the legitimacy of their wealth leading to concerns about undesirable people slipping into the country, says critics. According to an anti-corruption watchdog, 6,312 golden visas – half the number of all those issued – had been reviewed for “possible national security risks”. Dr Susan Hawley, the executive director of Spotlight on Corruption, said: “This illustrates once again just how risky the golden visa regime was to the UK’s national security, and is likely to be just the tip of the iceberg. The government must publish its review of golden visas issued between 2008 and 2015, when minimal checks on applicants’ source of wealth were made, urgently. “We also need to know how many tier 1 visas issued to Russian nationals since 2008 have been found to pose a national security risk, and what steps the government is taking to revoke visas where appropriate.” After the 2018 Salisbury poisonings of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, a former Russian military officer and his daughter, the government launched a review into the investors who were awarded visas from 2008-2015. The review has yet to be published. Meanwhile, new investors continued to take advantage of the visa system. The latest Home Office data shows 798 investor visas were granted in the year to September 2021, of which 82 were awarded to Russians – the highest 12-month total since 2018. The scheme remained open, despite parliament’s joint intelligence and security committee saying in 2020 that it was “welcoming oligarchs with open arms”. “It offered ideal mechanisms by which illicit finance could be recycled through what has been referred to as the London ‘laundromat’,” the committee said. “Russian influence in the UK is ‘the new normal’, and there are a lot of Russians with very close links to Putin who are well integrated into the UK business and social scene, and accepted because of their wealth. “This level of integration – in ‘Londongrad’ in particular – means that any measures now being taken by the government are not preventative but rather constitute damage limitation.”",News/UK news,Russian oligarchs on UK sanctions list were granted ‘golden visas’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/30/russian-oligarchs-on-uk-sanctions-list-were-granted-golden-visas
3/31/2022,"Gareth Southgate called it “an absolute joke”. Declan Rice went with “total embarrassment”. For Jack Grealish it was “ridiculous”, which works on quite a few levels. Given time to reflect, Jordan Henderson was more profoundly existential. “What have we become?” he asked. And it is an excellent question, deserving of a serious answer. By that stage Southgate, who is generally the most sensible person in the room, had also compared the jeers directed at Harry Maguire before kick-off on Tuesday night to the sustained racist abuse of John Barnes by card-carrying neo-Nazis in the 1980s. At which point it is hard not to wonder if this is all really about the thing it’s about. Or if England’s manager and his players are being caught in a sideswipe from somewhere else, a self-fuelling piece of theatre born out of TV noise, punditry blather and the idiot wind of social media. Harry Maguire: anatomy of a booing. This is how news works now. And none of us come out of it looking great. Except the players, perhaps. On the most basic level it is good to see them sticking up for their mate. These are nice people. They do this for each other. And it’s good energy in other ways. Outside pressure can have an adhesive effect. Teams run on this kind of fuel. But it is hard to avoid the feeling of being dragged into some kind of cross-platform media event, a pantomime pile-on that might still do some genuine harm to the only relationship that really matters in all of this. The jeers from the supporters came as Maguire’s name was read out. This is not something that happens. There was a sense of double-take around the press box. But it seemed like there were some more the first time Maguire got the ball, although it was hard to tell if these were actually directed at a foul on Ollie Watkins. And there may have been more after that, although none that were audible from the south side of the stadium. It seemed significant that there were other unexpected noises throughout that first half, from the squeals of excitement whenever Grealish got the ball, to waves of noise that didn’t seem to relate to things in the usual football way. It all had a panto feel at times. The VAR checks brought groans, howls, theatrical countdown stuff. It seems significant that this was a young and restless friendly crowd. There are discounted tickets for these games. Family bundles were being offered. The crowd heading away at the end was more youthful and more mixed in age and sex than is often the case at Premier League games. This is good. New people are good. England football needs this. But it was perhaps a factor in the booing, which didn’t, to a long-term booing observer, feel quite the same as other booing in the past. There was a mischievous kind of theatre to it, a self-awareness, like the kind of booing you might hear from the Saturday evening sofa when some cinematic talent show scoundrel show pops up on screen. Football is a TV show now and TV demands heroes and villains. For the last year the weekly vilification of Maguire and his Manchester United colleagues has been been one of the dominant images of English football: a kind of zingy, salty theatre of pain, club-legend pundits taking it in turns to emote the stickiest, most clippable moments of show-fury. Here we have Roy Keane, sat on his throne like a wronged tribal elder, eyes glistening with ancient noble rage. Here we have another instalment in the ongoing inquiry into the public health disaster, the systemic horrors, the reactor core meltdown of Maguire’s disappointing club season. This is now an established TV trope, hot content, a way of reeling in the eyeballs while also buffing your own own punditry brand. It is also based in a fallacy. Maguire has had a poor season in a poor Manchester United team. But he has at no stage given up, or behaved cynically. The idea that he deserves to be booed is entirely mimetic, imitative, screen-influenced, like chanting your favourite TV catchphrase or yelling at soap opera characters in the street like they’re real people. And in the end none of this seems very real at all; from those diffuse Wembley boos to the rolling aftermath whereby this had by Wednesday morning become the top story on the breakfast bulletin, subject of chin stroking follow-up articles, the newest front in football’s ongoing battle with its own strange furies. Drown out the noise and the suggestion that Maguire doesn’t deserve to be playing for England is also nonsensical. He has a serious body of work here. These have been the Harry-Harry-Razza years, the rump of the team in those glorious twin tournament runs. Maguire has played 14 England games since October 2020, with 12 wins, no defeats, 10 clean sheets and also six (yes really: six) England goals. Really? You want to drop this guy? He played well at Wembley too, always there to be used as a wall or a resting place in possession, and carrying the ball forward to great effect. Maguire with England: this is the best of him. It isn’t hard to see why. Five years of settled selection and tournament training has left England with a more grooved defensive system than the fretful chop and change at United. This England defence moves together, communicates well and knows its positions at every phase. With 20 minutes gone Maguire was caught upfield, but came chugging back dutifully, drifting into position unnoticed as James Ward-Prowse and Tyrone Mings smothered the danger. Compare this with the wild free jazz of the United backline. Maguire and England: this works. Perhaps a more productive form of punditry would be to ask why this is, to critique the structural reasons why so many talented players perform poorly in a United shirt, to examine why the club seems such an essentially unhappy place. Or you know, just go with the cinematic rage. It is worth noting any sense of hostility evaporated almost instantly. England fans generally like and admire Maguire. Throughout the game there were droning trumpet renditions of the Haa-rry Mag-why-er song, intoned to the tune of La Bamba. With 20 minutes gone he shielded a dangerous attack out of play and drew a warm gust of applause from the same western end that had generated those boos. All England eras have a shelf life. It has been six years of Southgate now, and more games than any England manager besides Bobby Robson and Alf Ramsey. England’s players, supporters and their entirely admirable manager have been dragged through some pretty strange places in that time, not least the gruelling tides of the last two years. Little wonder everyone around here might get a little angsty and prickly now and then. But the booing of Maguire feels like a false flag, learned behaviour, TV distraction. Listen to Jack: it’s ridiculous.",Sport/Football,Booing Harry Maguire for England is a ridiculous pantomime pile-on,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/30/booing-harry-maguire-for-england-is-a-ridiculous-pantomime-pile-on
3/31/2022,"Rachel Clarke is spot-on in debunking the myth propagated by Boris Johnson that the NHS was not overwhelmed by Covid (The claim that the NHS ‘coped’ with Covid is not true – it’s drowning and damaged, 23 March). A complete collapse of the NHS was only prevented by policies that included discharging older people untested back to care homes and refusing to admit some of them with severe Covid symptoms. Present deaths from Covid are well below the peaks of earlier waves, but how many people have died and are still dying prematurely through delayed diagnosis and treatment? Freedom day last July has led to health services, including hospitals, being clogged up with Covid patients, hampering the efforts to deal with the massive backlog. But our prime minister has already moved on and consigned to history the many thousands of needless deaths that his policies contributed to.Ron WaltonPenarth, Glamorgan  Simon Jenkins is right to highlight that excess deaths is the one robust indicator that we have to compare different countries’ experience of the pandemic (Two years ago I said I was taking Covid ‘with a pinch of salt’ – perhaps I was wrong, 25 March). During 2020 and 2021, the UK’s excess death rate was about 20% higher than in Belgium and the Netherlands, nearly 90% higher than France and Germany and 120% higher than Sweden. The challenge that the public inquiry faces is to determine the relative contributions to the greater loss of life in the UK that was due to our pre-existing health, the public health policies pursued by the government and the quality of our health services.Nick BlackProfessor of health services research, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine  Simon Jenkins omits to mention serious concerns that the NHS would be overwhelmed by Covid in March 2020 if action had not been taken. Lack of capacity, especially in intensive care, meant a lockdown could not be avoided, given the slow response by the government in January and February. Earlier action to slow the spread of the virus might have reduced deaths and avoided the need for harsher restrictions as announced by the prime minister on 23 March. The forthcoming public inquiry will need to examine the reasons for delay, the UK’s inadequate preparedness for a Sars pandemic, and what now needs to be done to build resilience in the NHS and other public services for the future.Chris HamSolihull, West Midlands  Simon Jenkins has a typical non-mathematicians’ misunderstanding of modelling. When a model produces a range of outcomes – for example, of between 20 and 5,000 events and a most likely outcome of 2,000 – it does not mean that the model is predicting 5,000, because that is the worst-case scenario, contingent on a particularly unfavourable set of circumstances. So to criticise models on this basis is wrong – a bit like chastising weather forecasters who say there is an outside chance of a hurricane when said hurricane doesn’t appear.Dr Richard CarterPutney, London  Thank you for Rachel Clarke’s excellent article.

3/31/2022,"It was with great interest that I read Diane Taylor’s piece about seasonal Ukrainian workers (‘Scandal in plain sight’: charities call for help for Ukrainian seasonal workers, 28 March). I have sponsored the visas of the wives and son of two seasonal workers who are in the UK on short-term visas. So far so good, and I’m expecting them here hopefully next weekend. The wives and little boy will be here under the refugee scheme and it was planned that they would live with me for at least six months. On realising that they would be living 40 minutes away from their husbands who are staying in a hostel, I decided to try find other accommodation for them. Thanks to the magnificent generosity of a local property company, they will now have a house and will be able to live as a family rent-free for up to nine months. This is not down to the government, which stymies the efforts of all, but those most determined to help refugees. There are now more offers of help than there are applicants, and I suspect that is down to the overly complicated bureaucracy put in place by the government that discourages people from even applying. Our government is full of mealy-mouthed, meaningless pronouncements. It is shameful. With a bit of luck, these agricultural workers will be able to apply for refugee status when their work visas end, and then they will be able to stay and work wherever they like for three years.Lowri CoultenKings Lynn, Norfolk  The UK’s visa system is indeed causing great distress to already traumatised Ukrainians (UK visa rule leaving refugees stranded in war-torn Ukraine, say charities, 28 March).

In his attempt to justify it, he went even lower, 28 March), I’m wary of creating role models to inspire disadvantaged groups because, as he says, they are put on a pedestal only to be knocked down. True role models are often unassuming people like our parents, who lead by example, not celebrities. But the concept of inclusivity, as exemplified by the modern Oscars, is predicated on the assumption that successful people will inspire others who look like them. So if you play this game, you must be prepared to accept the sudden change of your hero Will Smith to zero.

3/31/2022,"The equality and human rights commission is supporting Rico Quitongo in a landmark race discrimination claim against his former club, Airdrieonians. An employment tribunal hearing is expected to take place in the coming months, in what marks the EHRC’s first case in Scotland since their setting up of a race discrimination fund in late 2021. Quitongo claims he was the victim of racial harassment and victimisation after an alleged case of racist abuse from one of club’s supporters at a League One game against Queen’s Park last September. In a statement issued the following month, the club said: “Airdrieonians FC has conducted a thorough investigation into the alleged racist remark towards our player Rico Quitongo and have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to take further action.” Quitongo, a 22-year-old defender, was released from his contract in January and subsequently joined Peterhead. A statement issued by EHRC and PFA Scotland said: “The claim follows an alleged incident of racism against Mr Quitongo by a supporter during a match in September 2021, and arises from the way the issue was subsequently handled by Airdrieonians FC.” Lynn Welsh, head of legal and compliance at the EHRC in Scotland, said: “There is no place for racism in football, or any other part of our society. As the equality regulator for Great Britain, the EHRC are pleased to support this case through our race discrimination fund. Every employer should understand their responsibilities, and what the consequences are for not following the law. “As both employers, and as part of their wider community, football clubs have an important role to play in tackling discrimination. That starts with their duty to protect their employees, including the players on the pitch who are too often still subject to racist abuse.” Margaret Gribbon from Bridge Employment Solicitors is representing Rico Quitongo and said: “Rico is strongly committed to pursuing this legal claim in an effort to ensure that no other footballer experiences what he has. “He hopes to effect much needed change, by exposing the gap between anti-racism rhetoric and the realities faced daily by footballers subjected to racist abuse and discrimination. He is extremely grateful to PFA Scotland and the Equality and Human Rights Commission for their support.” Airdrie said on Wednesday: “Airdrieonians Football Club abhors all forms of discrimination and take a zero tolerance approach to racism. Airdrieonians conducted its own investigation and found that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the complaint made from a supporter. “Airdrieonians also reported all matters to Police Scotland who, Airdrieonians understand, investigated and no criminal prosecution resulted. Claims have been made to the Employment Tribunal by Mr Quitongo. Those claims are denied in the entirety. No further comment will be made out of respect for those ongoing legal proceedings.” The Scottish Football Association said: “The Scottish FA has initiated an investigation into race discrimination claims made by Rico Quitongo against his former club, Airdrieonians FC. We are aware that an employment tribunal claim has been raised by the player, supported by PFA Scotland and the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and await the outcome of that tribunal. “The Scottish FA condemns all forms of racist and discriminatory behaviour. Indeed, our Equality Vision states that ‘everybody should have the opportunity to participate in football at all levels, and that no individual should be discriminated against.’” A Scottish Professional Football League spokesman said: “We are not in a position to comment given this is an ongoing legal matter.”",Sport/Football,Rico Quitongo backed by EHRC in discrimination claim against Airdrie,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/30/rico-quitongo-backed-by-ehrc-claim-against-airdrie

3/31/2022,"The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has promoted Ramzan Kadyrov to lieutenant-general for his role in the invasion of Ukraine, which the Chechen leader is using to showcase his loyalty to Moscow and his own impunity. This week Kadyrov claimed that a key ally linked to the 2015 murder of the Russian opposition leader, Boris Nemtsov, was injured fighting in the besieged port city of Mariupol. Rustam Geremeev was pictured in hospital, where Kadyrov visited him. Earlier videos the Chechen leader posted calling Geremeev a “dear brother” claimed to show him on the frontlines in Mariupol, including at the city hall. Nemtsov’s family have long insisted that Geremeev was a mastermind of the murder plot. Five Chechen men were found guilty of the killing in 2017, but the trial was denounced by relatives and allies as a cover-up that failed to bring those behind the assassination to justice. Investigators told the 2017 trial that they visited Geremeev’s property in Chechnya but “no one opened the door”. They also named Geremeev’s driver, Ruslan Mukhudinov, as an organiser of the killing and said he offered the suspects millions of roubles for the murder. Mukhudinov has since fled and investigators said after the verdict that the case against him was ongoing. Geremeev, who is a relative of two Russian MPs, served in the same paramilitary security unit as Zaur Dadaev, a former senior officer convicted of shooting Nemtsov. The unit has close ties to Kadyrov, though he has never been directly linked to the murder. Geremeev’s appearance on the frontlines in Mariupol is a show of both Kadyrov’s strength and his allies’ apparent ability to defy Russian law. However, the multiple videos shared by Kadyrov are not filmed on the frontline, suggesting the Chechens may have a role with as much responsibility for propaganda as for fighting. The presence of Kadyrov’s men, who have a reputation for extreme brutality, is most likely aimed as much at spreading fear as bolstering numbers in battle. They may also take on other tasks, with some reportedly assigned to patrol behind frontline forces and shoot deserters. Others have been assigned to interrogations of civilians in the city – a grim speciality of Kadyrov’s followers, who have a track record of torture and abuse. A senior commander from one of the eastern Russian-backed breakaway regions, Alexander Khodakovsky, said in a video interview that the Chechens had not been expected to fight on the frontlines. Instead they were originally brought in for “clearing” operations in territory Russia seized around Mariupol. He later apologised to Kadyrov for the remarks undermining his fighter’s military prowess. For Kadyrov himself, regardless of the role taken on by his troops, the war has offered a chance to showcase his commitment to Putin, the man on whom his own bloodstained authority relies, by sending troops. To this end he has attempted to mobilise Chechen society behind the war effort, including recruiting at martial arts clubs and recently opening the gates of its prisons to army recruiters, with a group expected to travel to fight in Ukraine with the next rotation, security services said. But he has also used it to try to boost his own profile as a ruthless fighter, with his men emphasising their loyalty to him rather than to the Russian state. He has a troubled relationship with branches of the Russian security services. This week he denounced peace talks even as Russia promised to reduce military activity around the capital, Kyiv. “We need to finish what we started,” Kadyrov said in a statement.",News/World news,Putin promotes Chechen leader with ties to murder of Kremlin critic ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/30/putin-promotes-chechen-leader-with-ties-to-of-kremlin-critic
3/31/2022,"Premier League clubs are to again consider the prospect of allowing five substitutions per team within a match, with the change likely to finally be adopted. Teams have voted against the introduction of five substitutes on three occasions in the past two years, leaving England’s top flight as the only top-level league in Europe where three changes for any team in any give match remains the maximum permitted. Jürgen Klopp has been among the most vocal critics of the lack of change to the status quo and with the International Football Association Board, the sport’s rule-making body, confirming that the one-time emergency rule has now been made permanent, a possible change is to be put before clubs at a Premier League shareholders meeting on Thursday. League sources have confirmed the issue is up for debate and it is believed a change in the law could be agreed in principle at the meeting ahead of full implementation next season. After strong resistance over the past two years there is now also a feeling among clubs that the numbers are finally there to authorise a change, with 14 of 20 votes required to put new rules in place. The row over an expanded subs’ bench cuts to the heart of rivalries among top-flight sides. Klopp, for instance, and has had a habit of contrasting the demands placed on his Liverpool squad with those faced by relegation-threatened Burnley, who are among the clubs thought to have voted against the change. While smaller clubs believe that more substitutes gives bigger clubs with deeper squads an unfair advantage in individual matches, Klopp points to the harmful effect that not moving from three to five subs has on players who not only are key to their clubs but also to their international sides. Before Christmas, Klopp used Sean Dyche’s side as an example of how some clubs play significantly fewer games once international fixtures are taken into consideration and he returned to the same theme prior to the current international break. “You have to recover and rest every second you can do so,” Klopp said. “It is really tough for the boys, not just us but others as well. My first year the team had 63 games in 2015-16. No international games involved in that, just club. “This year it will not be much less but it is tough. We have to think about how we can keep these world class players [fresh]. Sorry to say but during the international break I don’t know how many Burnley players on international duty, I don’t know.” Six players from the Burnley squad were called up for by their respective national teams in this break, with Nick Pope selected in goal for England against Ivory Coast on Tuesday, a fixture in which he faced club teamate, Maxwell Cornet.

3/31/2022,"We’re living in two realities: one in which people have returned to living life as if Covid is over, and the other in which we are approaching record levels of infections, with an estimated 4.26m cases last week. Most of us know people who have Covid, work and education are being disrupted, and the NHS is under severe pressure again due to new patients and sick staff. Admissions with Covid are only 2% below the first Omicron peak two months ago and still rising. While about half are currently admitted primarily for other reasons, numbers are rising in primary Covid admissions too and admissions in over-65s are now 15% higher than their January 2022 peak. The pandemic has changed, but the idea that it is over is false. Omicron represents a major variant, taking over in the UK in a similar way to Delta last summer and Alpha last winter. The ubiquitous narrative that the pandemic is over exists because most people (including the government) now believe at least one of the three big myths of the Omicron age. We need to move past these myths to firstly anticipate the future, and secondly do something to prepare for it. The first myth is that coronavirus is now endemic, and just another disease we have to live with. We do, unfortunately, have to live with Covid. But the word “endemic” is commonly used in epidemiology to describe a disease that does not spread out of control in the absence of public health measures – in some sense, it means a predictable disease. This clearly does not (yet) describe Covid. Globally, we have just experienced by far the highest surge of cases of the pandemic so far with Omicron’s BA.1 variant. Many countries in Europe, including the UK, are experiencing a significant second Omicron (BA.2) wave mere months after the first. Neither were predicted and they are rapidly changing our assessment of the evolution of coronavirus and the implications for protection from vaccination or previous infection. The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, recently warned that new variant waves will come, but we don’t know when or what they will be like. People have declared Covid endemic after every previous wave and there is nothing special about this latest wave – they are still wrong. Covid will probably become endemic – over some unknown timescale - but even then, endemicity certainly does not necessarily mean mild. There is a significant global burden of ill health and death, for instance, from endemic diseases such as TB and Malaria. As it stands, trying to ignore a disease that is still so unpredictable feels a bit like turning your back on a hungry tiger in the undergrowth. Next, we have to debunk the myth that coronavirus is evolving to be milder, and each new variant will be milder than the last until it becomes a common cold. New variants of Covid have arisen rapidly over past two years. Each variant of concern has spawned several offshoots – like our current BA.2 wave – but most gamechanging new waves we’ve seen have come from variants that have evolved completely independently from each other. Omicron did not evolve from Delta and Delta did not evolve from Alpha, Beta or Gamma. Rather, they came from different earlier strains. There has been no progression through successive variants, and no building towards “mildness”. It is also simply not true that viruses always evolve to become milder. What drives evolution is transmission: variants that infect more people will thrive. Because most Covid transmission happens while people have no or few symptoms, severity is not a driver of evolution but instead a byproduct of whichever mutations improve transmission and how they interact with existing levels of immunity. For Alpha and Delta, this led to greater severity and for Omicron (somewhat) less severity, but this was an evolutionary accident. The next variant could easily be more severe again. While many assume that the four other coronaviruses that cause common colds started as epidemics and then eventually became the mild colds of today, we have no idea whether this takes years, decades or centuries, or even if it is inevitable. We simply do not know much about the long-term evolution of new coronaviruses in humans. Finally, there is the pernicious myth that we’ve somehow “finished” our vaccination programme, and there is no point in waiting to return to normal. The UK does have a high level of vaccination, particularly in older, more vulnerable populations, and the initial two dose rollout in adults is largely complete. Unfortunately, immunity from vaccines wanes over a matter of months – mostly against infection, but also against severe disease and death. Boosters help, but also mean it’s more a question of whether you are up to date with vaccination rather than just vaccinated. Most children remain entirely unvaccinated. Around a third of over-12s are yet to receive their booster in the UK, and we’ve only just started another booster round for people who are over 75 or clinically extremely vulnerable. Most children, meanwhile, remain entirely unvaccinated. As the world is increasingly either vaccinated, infected or both, the way the virus will evolve to improve transmission is by becoming better at evading our immune system, like Omicron did. This means that existing vaccines (targeted to old strains) and previous infection will become less able to protect us from new infection, as tens of thousands of people are finding out with their second (or more) Covid infection. As Prof Danny Altmann argues, instead of relying on frequent boosters of the same vaccines, we must develop better and longer lasting ones. We are currently pushing existing vaccines to their limits with high infection levels, but we should instead be supporting them by reducing transmission. Returning to normal behaviour does not return us to normal life. It returns us to a life with more disruption, more sickness and more strain on the NHS. But we can certainly learn to live with Covid better. We need to rediscover our ambition to improve public health as we did in the 18th and 19th centuries. We can introduce serious upgrades to infrastructure: better ventilation, less crowding, increased air purification and sterilisation, more green spaces, changed work practices. We can also tackle inequalities with improved sick pay and housing and population health. All of this is beneficial over and above Covid. We can do it, but we first need to stop believing in these persistent myths.

3/31/2022,"Another series defeat and England have now won one of their past 17 Tests. Whatever decisions are made over the next few weeks I expect this run to continue for a good while yet because, put simply, where you need a nucleus of quality, experienced players at the heart of a Test team they have a vacuum. Particularly in this form of the game, the lack of experience countering different conditions is unquestionably a disadvantage. England has an oversupply of young white-ball talent, players who can come in and play brilliantly from the off. But to succeed at the highest level of the red-ball game there are no short cuts – a batter needs to put in the hours grooving a repeatable technique that can stand up under pressure against the best bowlers in the world. There are not many Alastair Cooks who can come in and make a hundred on debut; that attitude, character and skill needs to be built up over a period of time. If we are to create an experienced core we must keep faith in the best of our young players, which means celebrating their successes and forgiving their failures. There is a lot of scrutiny in red-ball cricket. As a batter you’re expected to make good decisions for long periods of time and there is not a lot of understanding when attention slips and you pay the price. These players’ confidence has to be protected, by making sure they are in supportive environments at their counties and with England, surrounded by people who trust them, who know their games and their personalities. Batters often go through cycles of getting picked, not doing well, getting dropped and eventually getting selected again – and every time the pressure is heightened. That makes it harder still to be clear‑minded and find a simple, repeatable method in the way you bat. Players need to focus, but they also need to be relaxed enough to enjoy the occasion. In saying this I am remembering my own experiences but also thinking about players such as Ollie Pope, who is considered by a lot of people in the game to be a high-class young player, and Haseeb Hameed, who was dropped after the Ashes when I am absolutely convinced he would have been successful in the West Indies, certainly in Antigua and Barbados. I am thinking also of Zak Crawley, who has talent and needs to be supported as he tries to learn quickly from his mistakes, to be more clinical with his execution without losing his aggressive intent, while Dan Lawrence shows promise but still has work to do on his technique. England have three senior batters in the top seven, but one of those is Ben Stokes who is an all-rounder and at times bats like one, and another is Jonny Bairstow, who comes in at six where he is not necessarily setting the tone but reacting to what has gone before. That leaves only Joe Root in the top order and if he goes early it does set the tone and as we saw in Grenada things can fall apart quickly from there. England are lacking top-order players who can bat time and build partnerships and those things are so important. Watching the final Test I was reminded of the match in Antigua in 2019 when West Indies played England on a very difficult, uneven wicket, not dissimilar to the one in Grenada this time. The home side won the toss and elected to field, Root was twice dismissed cheaply and West Indies showed a lot of determination, discipline and resilience, the key qualities of a successful Test side, to post a good first-innings score and win by 10 wickets. I was involved as batting coach and that was one of the few times I spoke to the team after the game. I felt my role was mainly to deal with individuals one on one, but after Trevor Bayliss and Root had said a few things, I spoke up. It seemed to me that as a group they were lacking in those key attributes and that too many times batters showed poor decision-making in the shots they took on. The disappointing thing is here we are now and in Grenada that same fragility was still there. It is not all about experience. The England squad have played far more first-class cricket than their opponents, but West Indies found players with real attitude and character. They are not flashy, butthey got the job done under the examination of Test cricket. We have to give credit to the way they came together as a team and in Nkrumah Bonner and Joshua Da Silva they had individuals without enormous Test experience who showed those qualities of determination, discipline and resilience. In their desperation to reset the ambitions and the results of the red-ball team, I am not sure it would be wise for England to call up more youngsters. Not when there are people in the county game who have shown over a period of time an ability to adapt to different wickets, counter different types of bowling and show good decision-making. I spent some time this week at Merchant Taylors’ School watching Middlesex play Surrey. Rory Burns was there, a bit of a comedown from playing in the Ashes in Australia to a cold school ground in March, and he was out for nought and 10. On the other side, Sam Robson and Mark Stoneman batted extremely well – both have tasted international cricket but have had time to improve as players and mature as people and would go back better for the experience. For me, that red-ball reset has not started yet and will not while there is so much uncertainty at the top – no permanent head coach, no permanent director of cricket, no ECB chair and a lot of speculation about the ECB chief executive leaving his job soon. There are big calls to be made in the coming weeks. I have seen some speculation about potential candidates for the role of director of cricket that have surprised me – my hope is that someone is chosen because they have the right qualifications and experience rather than because they happen to be popular with an influential group of people. There are no Tests in the next couple of months, but this is a massively important period for the future of the England side.",Sport/Sport,England need to work with young batters despite the inevitable failures  | Mark Ramprakash,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/30/england-young-batters-despite-failures-test-level
3/31/2022,"A Russian tech giant mostly owned by western investors is helping websites pushing false claims about the war in Ukraine to make thousands of dollars every day through digital advertising. Yandex is considered Russia’s equivalent to Google, running both a search engine and an extensive digital advertising business. Its deputy CEO, Tigran Khudaverdyan, resigned this month after the European Union imposed sanctions on him. The Bureau for Investigative Journalism has discovered Yandex-delivered ads appearing alongside misinformation and propaganda produced by more than half a dozen Russian-language news sites. These attracted more than 420m visits in February, according to SimilarWeb, suggesting these sites could be making tens of millions of dollars annually from digital ads. Adverts ran alongside false stories about US bioweapons labs in Ukraine, claims that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy is displaying symptoms of drug use, and reports parroting Russian claims that the “special operation” is going entirely to plan. Others detail supposed provocations by Ukraine aimed at Russia’s allies, or refer to the Russian invasion as an “operation to denazify and demilitarise Ukraine”. Any ad revenue would be channelled through a business owned by some of the world’s largest investment firms, most of which are based in the US. “A big part of online disinformation and online propaganda is that it’s quite profitable financially,” said Jane Lytvynenko, a research fellow at the Shorenstein Center at Harvard who specialises in analysing misinformation. “And so cutting off that revenue stream, I think, is very important.” Some of the sites documented by the Bureau have direct links to the Russian state. The Bureau found Yandex serving ads on the website of the state news agency RIA, and two offshoots of the state-owned Sputnik. One of the largest sites, with more than 177m visits in February, was Lenta.Ru. Lenta is part of Rambler, a media group that was bought in 2020 by Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, which is state-owned and under US and UK sanctions. The Bureau confirmed that Lenta.Ru was using Yandex’s video advertising up until at least 10 March. While Yandex is headquartered in Moscow, it is listed on the New York stock market Nasdaq under a company registered in the Netherlands. Analysis by the Bureau shows that the vast majority of its shares are owned by investors based in the west, in particular the US. Among them are some of the world’s largest investment firms, asset managers and banks. As of 16 March, Yandex’s largest single shareholder was Capital Group, an asset management fund with trillions of dollars under management, which owns a 13% stake in the company. The second and fourth largest shareholders were also huge asset management firms: Invesco and Fidelity. Capital Group said it had a longstanding policy not to comment on its holdings, but added: “Our hearts are with the Ukrainian people and all those harmed by this war.” Fidelity said it had decided not to purchase Russian securities in light of recent events, and would consider eliminating its current Russian holdings. Invesco has also been approached for comment. “Investors need to also think through how their money is being used, where that money is being invested, and how they can contribute to isolating Russia and Russian companies,” said Lytvynenko. “Especially as they spread propaganda worldwide.” Among the top 10 shareholders, only two are not big western investment firms: a family trust in the name of the Yandex founder Arkady Volozh, and a former executive at Yandex. More than half are based in the US. The company’s share structure means that Volozh’s trust controls, when combined with a small number of shares held by other directors and employees, more than 50% of the voting power, but only about 11% of the dividend-paying shares. Yandex’s share price has almost halved since the invasion of Ukraine. Grubhub ended a partnership with the company to create food delivery robots, while Uber announced it was accelerating pre-existing plans to cut ties. The company itself has not had sanctions imposed by the UK, despite calls from some MPs. Yandex’s stance is in contrast to many foreign web companies, which have taken action against attempts to justify Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Last week, for instance, Google announced it would bar any website that “exploits, dismisses, or condones” the war from using its advertising tools to earn revenue. Hours later, the Russian internet censor Roskomnadzor blocked Google News, accusing it of sharing “unreliable, publicly significant information” about the “special military operation”.
