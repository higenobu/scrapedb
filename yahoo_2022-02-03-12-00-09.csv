2/3/2022,"Source: Westend61 / Getty An Alabama teacher faces questions from many online users after a compromising video of her has made its way to the Twittersphere. In the clip, the unidentified teacher — whose Zoom name is “BCS Employee” — is lying in bed, backside up, as a shirtless man comes into view, hovering above her and from the rear. From the looks of the video, many online users assumed the two were having sex while the Birmingham City Schools employee was on a work-related Zoom call. As of now, it’s unclear whether the teacher’s assumably accidental and intimate livestream was broadcasted to her students during a virtual learning session, or her colleagues during a “COVID Conversations” Zoom meeting held at the end of January — in which BCS Superintendent Mark Sullivan coincidentally expressed his feeling that virtual school hasn’t been benefiting the city’s students. “God! He is beating her guts out!” someone viewing the teacher’s alleged intimate moment during the Zoom meeting says, adding, “Oh my God!” This is why Birmingham City Schools kids out and virtual! Teachers ain’t teaching. These BMT teachers are not like they use to be. They getting their bykes TAPPED out while kids on zoom. No morals. Just throw the whole school system away. pic.twitter.com/fp6R8bPygg — F*ck_Child_Support (@Fckchildsupport) January 27, 2022 RELATED CONTENT: “Florida Substitute Teacher Charged For Sleeping With Underage Student” Twitter users have had a lot to say as they’ve discussed the clip in the video’s replies. Most believe the woman was having sex as the Zoom call went on, despite the audacity of it all. Along with memes, they tweeted: “Every day I’m reminded why my children will be homeschooled…” “That’s why my parents put me in private school,” “Either she was sleep and buddy was waking her up or the wood ain’t woodin like it’s supposed to,” and, “They knew d*mn well the camera was on… Why would you even risk that?” Others came to the woman’s defense by saying the video could have been taken out of context, and maybe it wasn’t of the lovers being intimate.  “I can see how this could be taken out of context but hear me out… It looks like he noticed she was asleep, kept falling asleep and shook her to wake her up, then checked to see if she woke up or not. I HOPE that’s the case.” Although he may have been trolling, a man who claims to be the woman’s colleague tweeted: “This is my coworker. I’m a teacher at the same school. This was not virtual school, it was a council meeting. She’s a good woman & a good teacher. For ppl to post this with a misleading caption is heartbreaking. I’ve spent plenty of nights with her, trust me, that WASN’T her arch.” Chile… this whole story is a mess, class dismissed!

2/3/2022,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday he will decide soon whether to suspend a major county's sheriff after state investigators found he lied on police applications about killing someone as a teen, his past drug use and his driving record. DeSantis said he will discuss Broward County Sheriff Gregory Tony's future with his aides before deciding what to do next. DeSantis appointed Tony sheriff in January 2019, just days after taking office. He had fired Tony's predecessor, Scott Israel, for his alleged mishandling of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School massacre in February 2018, a decision that was upheld by the Florida Senate. “We are going to review everything, take a look. We saw the initial report. It will be something we will be reviewing in the coming days,” DeSantis said at a Miami press conference. He did not comment further. Under Florida law, the governor can permanently or temporarily suspend any local elected official for malfeasance or other infractions, with the official having the right to appeal the decision to the Senate. A Florida Department of Law Enforcement report issued late Monday said Tony repeatedly lied on his police applications, including failing to disclose that he fatally shot another teenager during a fight when he was 14. Tony was later found to have acted in self-defense and acquitted, but the applications required the disclosure of all arrests no matter the court decision. The FDLE said Tony could not be criminally charged because the false statements happened so long ago the statute of limitations had expired. The agency has turned its report over to the state ethics commission for its consideration. That commission could also recommend DeSantis suspend Tony. A Broward Sheriff's Office spokeswoman on Tuesday directed all questions about Tony to a Miami law firm, which did not immediately respond to an email it requested seeking comment. The FDLE report says Tony declined to be interviewed by investigators. Before becoming sheriff, Tony worked for the Coral Springs Police Department from 2005 until 2016, working his way up to sergeant. He resigned to run a police consulting firm that specialized in active shooter training. DeSantis appointed him on the recommendation of the father of a Stoneman Douglas victim who knew him from the gym where they both worked out. The vetting process was completed in days. The FDLE investigation of Tony, 43, began after a local news website, the Florida Bulldog, revealed in May 2020 that Tony had fatally shot with his father's gun an 18-year-old neighbor during a fight at his Philadelphia home in 1993. He was charged with murder, but was acquitted in juvenile court after arguing he was defending himself and his family. The 20-page FDLE report said Tony lied by answering “no” when asked if he had ever been arrested for a felony when he successfully applied to the police academy in 2004 and again when Coral Springs hired him in 2005. It said he also falsely answered “no” on a Coral Springs background questionnaire when asked “Have you ever injured or caused the death of another person?” and “Were you ever in a fight involving a weapon?” The investigation found that in 2003, Tony answered truthfully that he had once used LSD as a teenager when he applied for a job with the Tallahassee Police Department, his first law enforcement application. After that admission caused his rejection, investigators found that on subsequent police applications Tony answered “no” when asked if he had ever used or handled hallucinogenic drugs. Investigators say Tony also repeatedly lied on police and Florida driver’s license applications by answering “no” when asked if his license was ever suspended. Pennsylvania had suspended his license in 1996 for failing to pay traffic tickets. That last happened in 2019 when he applied for a new license shortly after he became sheriff. In the August 2020 Democratic primary, three months after the Florida Bulldog's revelation, Tony defeated former sheriff Israel, who was trying to get his job back. That November, Tony easily defeated his Republican opponent in the general election to win a four-year term.",U.S./Associated Press,Florida governor considering punishment for Broward sheriff,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-governor-considering-punishment-broward-205653869.html
2/3/2022,"DETROIT (AP) — A maverick judge in Michigan known for ripping into criminal defendants is catching criticism again from a higher court. The Michigan Court of Appeals suggested Jackson County Judge John McBain is ripe for a misconduct investigation for how he handled the sentencing of a woman convicted of killing her boyfriend on Valentine's Day 2015. The court overturned a 30-year minimum prison sentence and said a different judge must handle the case. It was the second time that McBain's work was set aside; the first sentence was a minimum of 35 years. Both were much higher than the guidelines. “If a trial judge is unable to follow the law as determined by a higher appellate court, the trial judge is in the wrong line of work,” the appeals court said in a 3-0 opinion Tuesday. Dawn Marie Dixon-Bey, 49, claimed self-defense and was convicted of second-degree murder in the fatal stabbing of Greg Stack. The appeals court, however, said McBain treated Dixon-Bey as if she were convicted of premeditated first-degree murder. The court noted that the judge grilled her and interrupted her right to speak. “She stabbed the victim in the heart not once, but twice, and murdered him in cold blood. ... She planned it,” McBain said at the hearing in 2020. McBain's conduct ""may warrant investigation by the Judicial Tenure Commission,” said judges Amy Ronayne Krause, Jane Markey and Douglas Shapiro, referring to a watchdog agency. McBain's office declined to comment Wednesday. During argument on Dec. 14, Krause said she had read the transcript from the hearing and found it “hideous.” McBain is known for making sharp remarks: Courtroom excerpts on YouTube have been watched hundreds of thousands of times. In 2015, while sentencing a man who had broken into a police officer's home, the judge said he wished the owner had returned in time. “Because you know what? You might not be going to the Department of Corrections for 10 years,” McBain said. “You might be getting buried in some cemetery.” The judge once took off his robe and helped police restrain a defiant man in his courtroom. ___ Follow Ed White at http://twitter.com/edwritez",U.S./Associated Press,"Court knocks judge, suggests he's in 'wrong line of work'",https://news.yahoo.com/court-knocks-judge-suggests-hes-195932498.html
