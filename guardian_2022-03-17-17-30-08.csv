3/17/2022,"Why, asked the lofty-minded, don’t the movies tackle the big issues of the day? So, what happens when you serve them up a star-studded, sizably budgeted, awards-hungry allegory about climate change? They moan. Don’t Look Up is a self-declared parable devised to edify through comedy. Two astronomers, played by Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio, discover a “planet-killing” comet heading for Earth. They try to save the world, only to encounter opportunism in the White House, frivolity in the media, and commercial greed, incompetence, sexism, apathy and so forth everywhere else, all enacted by luminaries ranging from Meryl Streep and Cate Blanchett to Mark Rylance, Tyler Perry and Ariana Grande. Rightwing wiseacres were pretty much bound to dismiss such an exercise as puerile preaching by jetsetting Hollywood hypocrites; and indeed, the National Review managed to find Don’t Look Up both “moronic” and “brain-injuriously unfunny”, while the Wall Street Journal discerned only “glib nihilism” in a film that “oozes with self-delight”. Surprisingly, however, the progressive camp also found this apparent gift horse wanting. Its advocacy of their favourite cause was too “blunt” (Rolling Stone), too “shrill” (Parade) or too “bombastic” (the Observer). To put it another way, the New York Times, RogerEbert.com and, most pointedly, the Guardian all agreed that the film’s handling of its vital message was just too damn “obvious”. Nonetheless, in the month after it dropped, Netflix subscribers spent 360m hours watching it, making its debut the second most successful in the streamer’s history. Were these untutored couch potatoes just too easy to please? Or might they have sensed accomplishment that their betters had somehow missed? You can see why those with preconceived attitudes to the film’s subject-matter might have felt it parrots the obvious. Familiar villains, from self-seeking politicians to TV airheads and billionaire egomaniacs, perpetrate well-worn enormities. If you’re tired of blaming their ilk for our woes, or bored with seeing them blamed, you might well disengage at the outset. Yet though the film’s situations may be farcical, its characters aren’t the two-dimensional ciphers you might expect. Streep’s Potus is the tale’s pivotal miscreant. To her, the mid-terms loom larger than an extinction-level event. Still, she’s no far-fetched ogre: in fact, she’s more believable than Donald Trump. Her self-interest somehow smacks of innocence rather than sinfulness, and she ends up lovable, rather than abhorrent. When cornered, she shocks with unexpected honesty. That kindness to animals should prove her Achilles’ heel seems tolerably apt. Blanchett’s cable-news host is no less multifaceted, a maestro of banality on air, but elsewhere conveying depths with little more than a flick of an eyebrow. Rylance’s big-tech guru isn’t a plutocrat but a mystic who sees himself as a genius. Meanwhile, DiCaprio and Lawrence’s scientists are no heroic paragons. Thus, the authors of our downfall emerge as engaging, relatable human beings rather than monsters. What’s more, the film’s rogues’ gallery includes one villain who’s all too often left out. It’s us. Ultimately, disaster turns out to require the inattention, triviality, ignorance, idiocy and tribalism of the people, not just the depravity of the privileged few they elect, enrich and idolise. In the end, it’s in the streets that the fate of the world is decided, by ordinary folk who don’t look up. The implication of all this is that what really dooms humanity isn’t the malignity of power-brokers or the rottenness of institutions; it’s the innate qualities that make humanity human. Is that obvious? It may be to some. However, many prefer to blame whatever bogeymen they already happen to anathematise, be they the other side’s politicians, capitalism, wokery or original sin. Perhaps one or other of these whipping boys does indeed bear sole responsibility, but Don’t Look Up invites us all to reappraise our mindset. Before settling on comedy as his vehicle, writer/director Adam McKay considered other ways of addressing his theme. He made the right choice. It’s humour that has given his message its peculiarly knowing edge. The search for gags led him away from dreary polemic and into the human heart. There he found that philosopher’s stone, entertainment that not only truly enlightens, but also enthrals the multitude. This all too rare feat has been achieved on the back of a sparkling script, acting that earns its eye-watering recompense, adroit editing, meticulous design and an inspired score. Still, it’s not the kind of thing that excites the Academy’s voters. Sadly, Don’t Look Up won’t be snagging that Best Picture statuette. But it should.",Arts/Film,Why Don’t Look Up should win the best picture Oscar,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/17/why-dont-look-up-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar
3/17/2022,"The federal government cannot demonstrate it is protecting Australia’s endangered wildlife because it is not monitoring most species, habitats or threats and there is limited evidence conservation plans are implemented, a review by the auditor general has found. In a report on the management of threatened species, tabled on Thursday, the Australian National Audit Office found the federal environment department had been partly effective in its administration of national environmental laws but not efficient. The audit found just 2% of recovery plans since 2013 had been drafted and finalised within the timeframes required under law, with the average time taken being 2,355 days (6.4 years). Once a plan was in place, the audit found progress on the actions required to stop the decline of a species was not being measured or tracked by the department in a coordinated way. Where reviews of plans were available, they typically indicated the objectives had not been fully met. In findings that conservation groups described as “incredibly concerning” the ANAO wrote the conservation status of most Australian species, once listed as threatened, was not monitored. The status of listed ecological communities and threats was not monitored at all. The report’s release comes days after the Morrison government announced there would be new measures in the budget to further streamline the process developments have to go through to receive their environmental approval. Environment groups have called the announcement a step towards an “industry free-for-all”, comments which the environment minister, Sussan Ley, has rejected. Overall, the auditor wrote there was limited evidence that the desired outcomes of Australia’s environmental laws for threatened species were being achieved “due to the department’s lack of monitoring, reporting and support for the implementation of conservation advice, recovery plans and threat abatement plans”. “There is no measurement, monitoring or reporting on progress, or on the contribution of listing assessments, conservation advice, recovery plans and threat abatement plans to their desired outcomes,” the report states. “Available information does not indicate desired outcomes have been achieved.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sophie Power, the national biodiversity policy adviser at the Australian Conservation Foundation, said the audit “starkly reveals how Australia’s key piece of environmental legislation is failing our unique threatened species”. Alexia Wellbelove, of the Humane Society International, said the report was more evidence of the need for stronger environmental protections, as recommended by the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel in his review of national environmental laws. “The failure to monitor the status of most species is incredibly concerning, made even more so by the total failure to monitor the status of ecological communities and key threatening processes,” she said. The report found that the threatened species scientific committee, which advises the government on listings of endangered species, was largely completing its assessments in the timeframes required under law. The average time take for an assessment in 2020-21 was 940 days. Recovery plans, recovery plan reviews, threat abatement plan reviews and changes to the list were not completed by the government within statutory timeframes and the department was unable to demonstrate any improvement over time. Only one of the 55 listed species and habitats with recovery plans due since 1 July 2013 met its statutory due date. Recovery plans must be reviewed within five years but this had not occurred for any of the 77 plans requiring review between July 2016 and June 2021.

The strategy noted that this risked an increase in the number of overdue recovery plans “which was realised”. A plan announced last year to reduce the number of species and habitats requiring recovery plans had been developed in order to bring the government back into compliance with legal timeframes, the report states. In September, the department published for public consultation a list of the first 185 species and habitats the government proposed would no longer have a recovery plan. The audit found that of 6,701 submissions the department received (6,505 of which were part of environmental campaigns) all disagreed with the proposal to scrap the recovery plans. Suzanne Milthorpe, of the Wilderness Society, said the report showed that “the wildlife that is core to Australia’s identity is being put at severe risk by the government’s unwillingness to fix problems they’ve been warned about for decades”. The report also found the government was not effective in identifying threats that should be assessed by the scientific committee for official listing as a key threatening process. No threats had been nominated for listing since 2011 despite the committee having stated there were several causes of environmental decline that were not currently listed as threats. Similar to recovery plans, the audit found most threat abatement plans were not routinely tracked and where a review was available it indicated the goals of the plan had not been fully achieved. Carol Booth, the principal policy analyst at the Invasive Species Council, said the audit showed the government was failing to apply basic processes to tackle threats to nature. She said it was “damning” the audit found there were no processes for determining whether Australia’s threat abatement and recovery efforts were effective. “One major failing identified by the audit … is that the major threats have not even been comprehensively listed under the EPBC Act – including adverse fire regimes, which has been under assessment for almost 14 years,” she said. The report makes six recommendations, including that the department establish an assurance process to monitor the implementation of conservation plans and a framework for the monitoring and reporting of listed species. The department has accepted all of the recommendations and said it “will commence working on their implementation”. “The report will be used to inform continued efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of management of threatened species and ecological communities,” a spokesperson said.

3/17/2022,"Six days after Vladimir Putin ordered his soldiers into Ukraine, Joe Biden gave his first State of the Union address. His focus was inevitable. “While it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake, now everyone sees it clearly,” the US president said. “We see the unity among leaders of nations and a more unified Europe, a more unified west.” In the countdown to the invasion, the Conservative chairman Oliver Dowden flew to Washington to address a thinktank with impeccable links to Donald Trump. “As Margaret Thatcher said to you almost 25 years ago, the task of conservatives is to remake the case for the west,” the cabinet minister told the Heritage Foundation. “She refused to see the decline of the west as our inevitable destiny. And neither should we.” Western values. The free world. The liberal order. Over the three weeks since Putin declared war on ordinary Ukrainians, these phrases have been slung about more regularly, more loudly and more unthinkingly than at any time in almost two decades. Perhaps like me you thought such puffed-chest language and inane categorisation had been buried under the rubble of Iraq. Not any more. Now they slip out of the mouths of political leaders and slide into the columns of major newspapers and barely an eyebrow is raised. The Ukrainians are fighting for “our” freedom, it is declared, in that mode of grand solipsism that defines this era. History is back, chirrup intellectuals who otherwise happily stamp on attempts by black and brown people to factcheck the claims made for American and British history. To hold these positions despite the facts of the very recent past requires vat loads of whitewash. Head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, claims Vladimir Putin has “brought war back to Europe”, as if Yugoslavia and Kosovo had been hallucinations. Condoleezza Rice pops up on Fox to be told by the anchor: “When you invade a sovereign nation, that is a war crime.” With a solemn nod, the former secretary of state to George Bush replies: “It is certainly against every principle of international law and international order.” She maintains a commendably straight face. None of this is to defend Putin’s brutality. When 55 Ukrainian children are made refugees every minute and pregnant women in hospital are shelled mid-labour, there is nothing to defend. But to frame our condemnations as a binary clash of rival value systems is to absolve ourselves of our own alleged war crimes, committed as recently as this century in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is to pretend “our” wars are just and only theirs are evil, to make out that Afghan boys seeking asylum from the Taliban are inevitably liars and cheats while Ukrainian kids fleeing Russian bombs are genuine refugees. It is a giant and morally repugnant lie and yet elements of it already taint our front pages and rolling-news coverage. Those TV reporters marvelling at the devastation being visited on a European country, as if its coordinates on a map are what counts, are just one example. Another is the newspapers that spent the past 20 years cursing eastern Europeans for having the temerity to settle here legally and now congratulating the British on the warmth of their hearts. And then there is the unblushing desire expressed by senior pundits and thinktankers that this might end with “regime change” – toppling Putin and installing in the Kremlin someone more congenial to the US and UK and certainly better house-trained. Spotting the flaw here doesn’t require history, it just needs a working memory. The west has already tried regime change in post-communist Russia: Putin was the end product, the man with whom Bill Clinton declared he could do business, rather than the vodka-soused Boris Yeltsin. Indeed more than that, London and New York are not just guilty of hosting oligarchs – giving them visas, selling on their most valuable real estate and famous businesses – they helped create the oligarchy in Russia. The US and the UK funded, staffed and applauded the programmes meant to “transform” the country’s economy, but which actually handed over the assets of an industrialised and commodity-rich country to a few dozen men with close connections to the Kremlin. In 1993, the New York Times Magazine ran a profile of a Harvard economist it called “Dr Jeffrey Sachs, Shock Therapist”. It followed Sachs as he toured Moscow, orchestrating the privatisation of Russia’s economy and declaring how high unemployment was a price worth paying for a revitalised economy. His expertise didn’t come for free, but was bankrolled by the governments of the US, Sweden and other major multinational institutions. But its highest cost was borne by the Russian people. A study in the British Medical Journal concluded: “An extra 2.5-3 million Russian adults died in middle age in the period 1992-2001 than would have been expected based on 1991 mortality.” Meanwhile, the country’s wealth was handed over to a tiny gang of men, who took whatever they could out of the country to be laundered in the US and the UK. It was one of the grandest and most deadly larcenies of modern times, overseen by Yeltsin and Putin and applauded and financed by the west. The western values that are being touted today helped enthrone the monster who is now shelling Ukrainian women and children. However corrupt and repressive his regime, Putin was tolerated by the west – until he became intolerable. In much the same way, until last month Roman Abramovich was perfectly fit and proper to own Chelsea football club. Now No 10 says he isn’t. There are no values here, not even a serious strategy. Today, Boris Johnson claims Mohammed bin Salman is a valued friend and partner to the UK, and sells him arms to kill Yemenis and pretends not to notice those he has executed.

3/17/2022,"Nope. Yeah, we know the Zags have an amazing record, a glittering statistical profile and a number of players that will go very high in the draft, but where have we heard that before? Gonzaga have landed in arguably the hardest region in the tournament and might be in for a few fights to the death just to reach the Final Four. Tyrell Feaster It may turn out that Gonzaga’s “year” was last year when they went undefeated until their shocking national championship game loss to Baylor. Still, I’m giving this a “qualified yes” because the top overall seed is justifiably the favorite to win the entire tournament. Their road to the Final Four should be a lot tougher this time around, however. Hunter Felt I think so. The single-elimination format is unsparing and their road to New Orleans, which includes potential dates with Memphis (in the second round), Arkansas (in the Sweet 16) and either Duke or Texas Tech (in the Elite Eight), won’t be a cakewalk. But as the only team in the country to rank in the top 10 of both adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency, the Zags are favorites on merit. After falling short in the national title game twice in the past four years, the third time will prove the charm for Mark Few and co. Bryan Armen Graham Gonzaga once again have the No 1 adjusted offense in the country according to kenpom.com with all five starters averaging double figures in scoring. Their free-flowing ball screen offense combined with the fact that you have to close-out playing for the shot and the drive on each player makes them a nightmare for opposing coaches to prepare for. Zags cut down the nets in Nola! Nicholas Levine Purdue’s Jaden Ivey has a chance to lock down his place as the best guard in this year’s draft class and throw away the key. If the hyper-athletic Ivey can string together a few impressive performances, be prepared for scouts and media type alike to spend months calling him the next Ja Morant. TF Gonzaga freshman Chet Holmgren feels like the obvious answer, given he’s one of the most unique potential No 1 picks in recent basketball memory. However, let’s go with Auburn’s Jabari Smith Jr, who is the kind of scoring weapon that can go on a star-making tournament hot streak. HF Chet Holmgren. The industry jargon for Gonzaga’s first-year star is unicorn: a 7ft big with the skill and ball-handling ability of a wing and the size and athleticism to bang away in the paint. The Minneapolis native’s court IQ and versatility made him the No 1 high-school recruit in the country and has him squarely in the mix to be the first overall pick in the NBA draft this June, all but ensuring his college career will be a short one. Catch him while you can. BAG Collin Gillespie. One of those players who it feels like has been on the court for the better part of a decade, Gillespie embodies all that Villanova basketball is about. The best back-to-the-basket point guard in the country, Gillespie is always a scoring and passing threat who cares only about winning – scary thought knowing this is his last go at it. NL Michigan. The Wolverines already had to fight tooth and nail to be one of the last four teams selected for the tournament. And let’s not forget head coach Juwan Howard was suspended for the final five games of the regular season. That combination should create more than enough momentum to spur a surprise tournament run. TF Never count out Loyola Chicago. Is this a sentimental pick? Absolutely. Can the 25-7 Ramblers bust a bracket like nobody else? Also, absolutely. Listen, I can’t predict that Sister Jean is going to somehow inspire them all to sneak their way into the Final Four (again), but I can see them pulling off several upsets before then. Vermont. The 13th-seeded Catamounts are experienced (five seniors in the starting lineup), take a lot of three-pointers (43.1% of all field-goal attempts) and make a ton of them (36.8% in all). If they can dictate their preferred methodical tempo against Arkansas and lock it down on the defensive end, they’ll be stirring up the echoes of Taylor Coppenrath and TJ Sorrentine in Burlington. BAG Saint Mary’s. A typical Randy Bennett team that is tough and connected on both ends of the floor. Point guard Tommy Kuhse is as crafty using the ball screen as any player in the country and he doesn’t lack experience as he is in his sixth year. Look for the Gaels to be a tough out for anyone. NL Baylor. The defending champions may be a great team that plays lockdown defense, but they aren’t completely healthy. Leading scorer LJ Cryor will be out for at least the first week of the tournament and his absence or limited availability may prove too much for the Bears to overcome. TF Arizona. They lost to Tennessee 77-73 in the regular season and are set for a potential rematch along the line. Now, the Vols face a tough draw – and are probably underseeded at No 3 – so it’s not guaranteed that the two teams will meet, but Arizona should be concerned if they do. HF Duke. The Blue Devils sputtered a bit down the stretch with a double-digit loss to archrivals North Carolina in Coach K’s final home game followed by a defeat to Virginia Tech in the ACC tournament. Friday’s tourney opener against Cal State Fullerton should be a straightforward affair, but a second-rounder against Tom Izzo’s Michigan State or Bob McKillop’s Davidson means the second week is hardly a guarantee. BAG Duke. On paper the Blue Devils have arguably the most talented roster in the country. The big question is how will the pressure and emotional drain of the farewell tour for Coach K affect them in March. If the end of the season is a sign then look for Duke to be upset, potentially against Michigan State. NL A No 11 seed is going on a very deep run. Every year a double-digit seed goes on a bracket-busting Cinderella run and Virginia Tech, Michigan and Rutgers all look the part this time around. TF Duke go one and done. We’ve already seen Coach K’s Blue Devils embarrassed and upset by North Carolina in the final home game of the head coach’s career. All that’s left for the Duke haters out there to hope for is one final early tournament exit. For a brief shining moment, No 15 Cal State Fullerton will be the most beloved basketball program in the country. No 14 Colgate take down No 3 Wisconsin. The Red Raiders lead the nation in three-point shooting (40.1%), are eighth in assists per game (17.2), haven’t lost a game since January and nearly sprung upsets of power-conference opponents NC State and Pittsburgh during the regular season. BAG LSU make a deep run. The Tigers, who recently parted ways with head coach Will Wade, will rally around Kevin Nicklebury to play their best ball of the season in March. Similar to when Michigan fired Bill Frieder and Steve Fisher took Glen Rice and co to the promised land in 1989, LSU have the roster and the chip on their shoulder to go far. NL Texas Tech, Kentucky, Arizona, Auburn. TF Gonzaga, Baylor, Tennessee, Kansas. HF Gonzaga, UCLA, Houston, Auburn. BAG Gonzaga, Purdue, Villanova, Kansas. NL Arizona. One of the most dominant teams in college basketball all season, these Wildcats might have more international flavor than any serious national title contender. Eight of Arizona’s 11 scholarship players, including six of eight in the team’s regular rotation – were born outside of the United States. E pluribus unum, indeed. TF Dry your eyes, Adam Morrison. Gonzaga will finally be champions for the first time ever. I get a 2004 Boston Red Sox vibe from this team: last year’s near-unbeaten season should only strengthen their resolve. HF Gonzaga. It’s about time. BAG Few, who has knocked on the national championship door twice in the last four years, will finally climb the ladder to cut down the nets. The depth, experience, confidence and versatility of this Gonzaga team gives it an edge on the rest of the field.

3/17/2022,"An SAS whistleblower who spoke to the media about a war crime allegedly committed by Ben Roberts-Smith has told the federal court he knew he was defying orders in doing so, but felt he couldn’t walk past such an “egregious” allegation. A soldier anonymised as Person 7, a still-serving SAS veteran of multiple deployments to Afghanistan with the SAS, spent a second day under cross-examination in Roberts-Smith’s defamation case on Thursday. He was questioned extensively about his service alongside Roberts-Smith and their fractious relationship. Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross and one of Australia’s most decorated soldiers, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. Person 7 told the federal court he was one of two SAS sources who appeared anonymously on 60 Minutes in 2019 in breach of defence force protocols. He alleged he had been told by another soldier that Roberts-Smith had kicked a bound, unarmed prisoner off a cliff during an SAS mission. Person 7 said that he had initially declined to speak to the media but that he ultimately agreed to because he “wanted to be a voice from within”. Person 7 denied he appeared on the program out of malice and “jealousy” towards Roberts-Smith, saying he was motivated by a desire to hold his former comrade accountable for his actions. “I am a senior [non-commissioned officer] in the army, I was told of an allegation of an egregious nature, I am not walking past that,” he said on Thursday. Person 7 said he raised the allegation with senior command within the SAS as long ago as 2013. Person 7 said he had been told by another soldier, known as Person 4, that Roberts-Smith had kicked an unarmed Afghan prisoner off a cliff during a raid in the village of Darwan in 2012. He said he was told the story on three separate occasions, including details that Person 4 watched the Afghan man’s head hit a rock as he fell, sending his teeth flying out of his head. Person 4 has earlier given evidence in this trial, telling the court he saw Roberts-Smith kick the bound prisoner off the cliff, falling to a dry riverbed below. Person 4 told the court the man was still alive when the soldiers reached the creek bed. He said Roberts-Smith then ordered he and another soldier to drag the badly injured man under a tree where he was shot dead on Roberts-Smith’s orders. Person 4 objected to giving evidence about his actions on other SAS missions in Afghanistan on the grounds of “self-incrimination” and denied suggestions by Roberts-Smiths lawyers that health issues had affected his memory. Roberts-Smith has consistently denied he unlawfully killed anybody on operation at any time, and specifically during the mission in Darwan. In his evidence, he told the court that he and a comrade had encountered the man shot in Darwan in a cornfield. The man had been carrying a radio, refused an order to stop and was lawfully “engaged”, Roberts-Smith said. He said the man was a legitimate target shot dead in accordance with the laws of war. Roberts-Smith maintained he could not have killed the man as alleged because there was no cliff from which to kick him. “There was no cliff … there was no kick,” he told the court. Roberts-Smith’s barrister, Arthur Moses SC, argued Person 7 had no direct knowledge of events at Darwan. Moses put it to Person 7 he had no right to air the allegations from that mission on national television, particularly if he did not have the “courage” to show his face. The soldier replied: “Mr Moses, if I’m told that a war crime has possibly been committed of a man being kicked off a cliff, dragged under a tree … left to wait there in agony and then executed … my responsibility is to make sure that that allegation is heard.” Person 7 conceded some of his comments to journalists about Roberts-Smith were “petty childish gossip”, including a rumour circulated by the regiment padre that a former neighbour had described Roberts-Smith as “a bastard of a kid”. Person 7 fought alongside Roberts-Smith at Tizak in 2010, the battle for which Roberts-Smith was awarded the Victoria Cross. Moses put it to Person 7 he was motivated by malice towards Roberts-Smith and jealousy of his numerous decorations. “You’re consumed with hatred of him because he got the Victoria Cross,” Moses said. “I’m not consumed with hatred Mr Moses,” Person 7 replied. “I don’t like him, but I’m not consumed with hatred.” “You’re obsessed by his awards,” Moses put to him. “I’m not obsessed,” Person 7 replied. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Moses also put it to Person 7 that he was trying to “influence” a formal investigation by the Inspector General of the Australian Defence Force (IGADF) into allegations of Australian war crimes by appearing anonymously on television. “You knew the allegation of kicking a man off a cliff was before the IGADF … Why did you need to repeat it on national TV as an insider?” Moses asked. “To let the Australian public know this was a serious allegation … and there was an aggressive PR campaign with witnesses being intimidated,” Person 7 said. Person 7 said his initial meeting with journalist Chris Masters was sanctioned by the military command, but that his subsequent conversations and interviews with Masters and Nick McKenzie were in breach of defence force policy. “It was a mistake, I know that, because it was against defence policy … I’m not proud of it, however, I can’t say I regret it, no,” Person 7 said. Masters and McKenzie are respondents in this defamation hearing. Person 7 remains in the witness box under cross-examination.

3/17/2022,"Senior human rights officials have repeated calls for a ban on the powerful Israeli spyware Pegasus until safeguards are in place to protect civilians from illegal hacking by governments. Calls for a moratorium on the sale and use of the military-grade spyware were made on Wednesday at a hearing of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) into widespread unlawful surveillance using Pegasus spyware against journalists and activists in El Salvador. “There’s no doubt that malware marketed for complex security threats is being manipulated and used against the media and civil society … which is having a chilling effect on democracy,” said Scott Campbell, senior human rights and technology officer of the UN office of the high commissioner for human rights. “Pegasus malware should stop being marketed and used until there are better global and national safeguards.” The IACHR hearing follows a joint investigation published in January by Access Now and Citizen Lab which confirmed the use of NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware against 35 journalists and human rights defenders in El Salvador. The hacking took place over 18 month from July 2020 to November 2021 and included 22 from the investigative news outlet El Faro. One journalist was hacked 49 times, another almost constantly for 269 days. Amnesty International’s Security Lab peer-reviewed the findings and independently verified forensic evidence showing the military-grade spyware was being operated by a single customer within the country, suggesting the Salvadoran government was the likely operator. “We urge El Salvador to implement an immediate moratorium on the use of spyware technology,” said Likhita Banerji from Amnesty International, which is calling for international standards and domestic legislation to limit surveillance, require greater oversight and transparency about contracts, as well as remedies for victims who are targeted illegally. El Salvador is one of the most deadly countries in the Americas where gangs, extrajudicial violence, corruption and poverty have forced hundreds of thousands to migrate over the past decade. The illegal cyber-surveillance took place amid mounting attacks on independent news outlets and human rights groups following the election of self-proclaimed reformer Nayib Bukele in June 2019, the hearing was told. This included El Faro being banned from government press conferences, ministries withholding information, a surge in online and in-person harassment, and threats and physical violence (including threats of sexual violence) against female journalists. Carlos Dada from El Faro said the hacking coincided with investigations into controversial and potentially embarrassing stories about the president’s negotiation with the street gangs, dealings with Venezuelan officials, government corruption and the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender. “We fear for ourselves, our families and our sources,” said Dada, whose phone was under surveillance for 167 days. The El Salvador cases add to the findings of the Pegasus project, an international consortium of 17 news organizations including the Guardian, on abuses of the spyware by the governments of at least 10 countries including Mexico, Saudi Arabia and India. The project, coordinated by the French non-profit group Forbidden Stories, last year reported on a leaked database containing tens of thousands of phone numbers of activists, lawyers, academics, journalists, political figures, business leaders, priests and dissidents who are believed to have been selected as people of interest by NSO’s government clients. Once infected with Pegasus, operators have total access to the phone, including the ability to intercept calls, read text messages and emails, control the microphone and camera, infiltrate encrypted apps and track an individual’s physical location. In Wednesday’s hearing, the Salvadoran government denied any knowledge of the illegal hacks, arguing that officials had also been targeted by the Pegasus spyware. “An extensive investigation is under way,” said a representative from the attorney general’s office, who accused the victims of stalling the investigation by failing to share information - an accusation vehemently refuted by the journalists. NSO says that it only sells its software to vetted government clients to prevent “terrorism and serious crime”. John Scott Railton, senior researcher at Citizen Lab with years of experience tracking Pegasus, said that it was not uncommon for governments to spy on their own officials, and questioned the government’s so-called extensive investigation. “I am unaware of any contact by the government with my team. IACHR representatives also seemed unconvinced by the government’s investigation. “This was a serious attack on democracy and democratic standards … one doesn’t wish to keep a list but so many rights were violated,” said Margarette May Macaulay, the rapporteur on the rights of persons of African descent and against racial discrimination. “The investigation must be as rigorous as possible and as quickly as possible … [But] there seems to be no urgency from the state.”",News/World news,Human rights officials call for Pegasus spyware ban at El Salvador hearing,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/pegasus-spyware-ban-el-salvador-iachr-hearing
3/17/2022,"The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has urged the world not to forget the humanitarian crisis in Tigray, saying that even amid the war in Ukraine there is “nowhere on Earth” where people are more at risk than the isolated region of northern Ethiopia. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general, is from Tigray and has incurred the wrath of the Ethiopian government in the past after accusing it of placing the region under a de facto blockade. Prime minister Abiy Ahmed’s government has accused him of bias, and of spreading misinformation. At a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday, Tedros implicitly addressed those concerns. He said such was the scale of the crisis, it would be a dereliction of his professional duty not to speak out. “Yes, I’m from Tigray. And this crisis affects me, my family and my friends very personally,” he said. “But as the director general of WHO, I have a duty to protect and promote health wherever it’s under threat. And there is nowhere on earth where the health of millions of people is more under threat than in Tigray.” Alluding to the Russian invasion of its neighbour, he added: “Just as we continue to call on Russia to make peace in Ukraine, so we continue to call on Ethiopia and Eritrea to end the blockade, the siege, and allow safe access for humanitarian supplies and workers to save lives.” The UN has been unable to get emergency food supplies into Tigray since mid-December. And while in recent weeks medical supplies have started to trickle in, after a six-month hiatus, the WHO and doctors on the ground have said the amount arriving is nowhere near enough to meet the needs of the population. Often there is not enough fuel to get supplies to where they need to go. Staff at Tigray’s biggest hospital told the Guardian earlier this month that patients were dying due to a lack of medical supplies. On Wednesday, Tedros said there was no treatment available for 46,000 people with HIV. “And the programme has been abandoned. People with tuberculosis, hypertension, diabetes and cancer are also not being treated, and may have died,” he added. Despite this “catastrophic” plight, he said, a communications blackout meant Tigray was “a forgotten crisis. Out of sight and out of mind.” Earlier this year, the government of Ethiopia sent a letter to the WHO, accusing Tedros of “misconduct”. Ethiopia’s ministry of foreign affairs said: “Through his acts, (Tedros) spread harmful misinformation and compromised WHO’s reputation, independence and credibility.” The government has denied placing Tigray under a de facto blockade, accusing fighters with the Tigray People’s Liberation Front of disrupting aid delivery routes and looting hospitals in areas once under their control.",News/Global development,"‘Nowhere on earth are people more at risk than Tigray,’ says WHO chief",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/17/nowhere-on-earth-are-people-more-at-risk-than-tigray-says-who-chief
3/17/2022,"Charlotte Mendelson’s four previous novels are clever, funny, ferociously observant and unapologetic about their origin in and passion for a particular corner of the bourgeoisie. Mostly set in London and north Oxford, looking towards Hungary in 2013’s brilliant Almost English, her fiction dissects the lives and minds of families who own messy Victorian houses, send children to Oxbridge and manage transgressive romantic lives. In the tradition of novels of middle-class dysfunction – Austen, Flaubert, Woolf and their descendants – the personal is political but politics simmer in the background: Mendelson’s version of England is a safe enough place for her characters to focus on domestic and professional life. The Exhibitionist has been longlisted for the Women’s prize. It opens bravely with Ray Hanrahan, patriarch and painter, who lives in a large house in north London amid the chaos of “books everywhere, wizened tangerines and cold coffee”, declaring that “Tolstoy was an idiot.” “We’re famously happy, aren’t we? Aren’t we? And totally unique.” Ray believes himself unique as an artist and his wife and children unique in their devotion to him. Partly because fiction is almost by definition uninterested in the unique – we read to learn and see patterns – the novel turns on Ray being wrong. His family’s devotion makes him happy, or would if there were ever enough of it, and other people’s happiness doesn’t concern him because he doesn’t believe in other people. Meanwhile, Ray’s wife Lucia, also an artist, is lying on her studio floor, ignoring the phone because it will be her gallerist calling with good news for her, which will upset Ray: “He tends his grudge like a sacred lamp.” Lucia has spent decades sabotaging her own career in order to be “the perfect assistant, honoured to be elected to serve the genius”. Having learned all this in the opening pages, the reader spends the rest of the book wanting her to take that call. (She does. It’s big.) The novel takes place over the weekend on which Ray has summoned his adult children, his brother and family, and an assortment of friends to celebrate the opening of his first exhibition in a decade. He wants to flaunt his career, his ownership and neglect of a big house, his wife’s loyalty and his children’s submission. It rapidly becomes clear that none of these things is as it seems to Ray, but nonetheless he dominates the novel and the thoughts and behaviour of all the characters. Lucia’s submission is willing but imperfect, ambition and desire never fully repressed. As well as her professional achievements she is concealing a new affair with a glamorous politician, Priya (party unspecified, not that kind of book, but there’s a whiff of Toryism). Lucia’s son from a previous relationship, Patrick, who is treated brutally by his stepfather, is patently unwell, living in a disintegrating caravan in the garden, allowing Ray to bully him into rejecting jobs he wants, unable to form relationships of any kind or even to speak much. Lucia and Ray’s oldest child, Leah, is her father’s handmaiden, compared by her more rebellious sister Jess to Dorothea Casaubon. As guests gather and Lucia hides in the garden texting her lover, Leah roams the house, spying and manipulating on her father’s behalf. Jess, who had escaped to Edinburgh, now returns with a partner who seems at least as much in love with Ray as with Jess, privately intent on persuading Jess to move back to her father’s house despite the obvious dangers. Ray is monstrous, and we read partly in the hope that he will get his comeuppance. It’s risky to build a novel around a monster: some readers will be annoyed on behalf of the patriarchy; some lucky folk find wicked parents implausible; stark moralism is difficult in fiction. The Exhibitionist stands or falls on the plausibility of Ray’s family’s enslavement to his delusions of grandeur, and for some readers it will fall. But partly because we see him through the eyes of his lifelong victims and partly because Mendelson is unfailingly excellent at the level of the sentence, Ray is horribly convincing, sitting spider-like at the centre of his web of destruction. The failure of Lucia’s repression makes her likable as well as pitiable and we long for her escape and Jess’s, Patrick and Leah seeming too far gone. This novel is a portrait of the artist as a monster, and for readers undeterred by the grand tradition of middle-class domestic realism, it’s a fine and haunting book.

3/17/2022,"Modern slavery is a violation of human rights, affecting millions of men, women and children across the world and in the UK. People who are vulnerable due to circumstances of poverty, instability or forced migration are taken advantage of and exploited in situations of unfree labour, trafficking and abuse. Women and girls fleeing war are particularly at risk and I am concerned about the possibility of trafficking for migrants as the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine unfolds. Given all of this, you might expect that the UK government and the Home Office were doing all they could to help victims of modern slavery in Britain. You would be wrong. Confirmed victims of human trafficking have no automatic right to stay in the UK. Despite this, Home Office guidance states that they will be automatically considered for temporary leave to remain if they do not already have this. Guidance also makes clear that this is appropriate in exceptional circumstances or for compassionate reasons. However, the number of victims of trafficking granted temporary leave remains extremely low – thanks to a freedom of information request from the children’s rights charity Ecpat, we know just 8% of applications were granted in 2021. One aspect of the government’s nationality and borders bill, which is now making its way through the House of Lords, seeks to codify in law the circumstances in which temporary leave to remain will be granted to assist the person in their recovery, to enable them to seek compensation or to cooperate with the police. Last week, Lord McColl tabled an amendment to make this provision more generous, providing at least 12 months’ support for confirmed victims of modern slavery, which was supported by peers. I hope the government gives this amendment serious consideration, but there is also more work to be done in terms of how the Home Office makes its decisions – an area that concerns me. Take the case of Jane (not her real name), who left Eritrea in the early 2000s with the help of an agent. She travelled with her employer to the UK and other countries. During this time she was abused, controlled, threatened and not paid. She was eventually confirmed to be a victim of trafficking and recognised as being particularly vulnerable. Despite this, temporary leave to remain was not judged necessary to protect and assist in her recovery. I have not seen all the paperwork so cannot comment on whether this decision was right, but I am in a position to comment about the way the decision was made. This is because I’ve seen her rejection letter. Leaving aside that it referred to Jane as a male throughout the correspondence, the letter made use of a US government report on trafficking to justify its decision. The US Department of State Trafficking in Persons report ranks governments’ efforts every year to combat trafficking. The report on Eritrea is pretty damning and places the country in tier 3, the lowest, implying that the government does not meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so. This includes not having adequate victim protection, with no efforts to identify or protect victims reported since 2015. The assessment reports that Eritrea does not provide any services directly to victims and it references the suggestion from an international organisation that returning asylum seekers had a well-founded fear of persecution. However in the Home Office’s hands, the very few positive aspects of the assessment, such as the establishment of a committee, have been cherrypicked and used as evidence that the authorities in Eritrea are willing and able to provide assistance. While the Home Office decision-maker relied on the assessment of the US, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office determined Eritrea to be one of 31 human rights priority countries in a ministerial statement from November 2021. This stated that Eritrea had made no improvements in the human rights situation during the first half of 2021 and that arbitrary detentions, indefinite national service and restrictions on freedom of expression all continued. Should the Home Office be flying victims of human trafficking back to such a country? Ministers have repeatedly provided assurances that decisions on granting leave to remain for survivors of trafficking will be made on a case-by-case basis. But it is hard to have confidence in the system when confronted with this quality of decision making. Lord McColl’s amendment would ensure a more generous approach to vulnerable and traumatised victims of the most serious crimes. Seriously considering it would be the least the government could do.
