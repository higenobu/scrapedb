4/11/2022,"About 30km west of the Belarusian border, the enemy’s tanks were rolling through the pine forests of Lithuania at speed until a makeshift obstacle made of barbed wire blocked their path. Soldiers carrying bolt cutters jumped out of the armoured vehicle at the front to clear the road. Then, a deafening bang. In its rush to victory, the advancing party had neglected to check the sandy terrain underneath the roadblock for mines. Luckily, for them, this was merely a dress rehearsal for a showdown between Russia and the North Atlantic alliance. No live explosives were used in Nato’s “Rising Griffin” manoeuvre at the Pabradė military base in western Lithuania. Instead, referees politely informed the tank commanders that their vehicles would have been ripped to shreds. The Russian enemy was being impersonated by American and Norwegian troops. The western defenders may have notched up a tactical victory against an eastern aggressor on this sunny April morning, yet Nato’s security architecture has never looked more fragile than in the spring of 2022, especially when viewed from Lithuania, a country long considered the alliance’s achilles heel. An independent republic since 1990, the southernmost of the three Baltic states borders both Russia-allied Belarus on its eastern side and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on its western flank. On Russian television, pundits have openly urged the Kremlin to escalate the war in Ukraine by enforcing a military corridor along the “Suwalki gap” – Lithuania’s short border with Poland – thus cutting off the Baltics from other Nato-allied lands. “Until last November, we had the Russian army quite far away from Nato’s borders,” said Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania’s foreign minister. “Now the military activity is very close. To add to that, Lithuania lies between the territory of Belarus and the territory of Kaliningrad. Which puts us in a strategic situation that is, let’s say, interesting.” Since 2016, after Russia’s annexation of Crimea, “enhanced forward presence” battlegroups have been stationed in four member states on Nato’s eastern flank: Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The war in Ukraine has led the alliance to further bolster its presence in the region, with multinational battalions to be dispatched to Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia. The military presence in Lithuania has been increased from approximately 1,200 to roughly 1,600 soldiers and equipped with new hardware, such as the German army’s light and mobile Ozelot anti-aircraft system, which can be used to protect airports from aerial assaults. But the function of these military units remains that of a “tripwire”: a reminder to hardliners in the Kremlin that invading what they may see as renegade breakaway nations of a former Russian empire would automatically trigger a military conflict with other western European states. But in their current state, there is little doubt the enhanced forward presence units would sooner or later be overrun. The scenario being rehearsed in the Rising Griffin exercise was a David v Goliath one, with the attacking force taking the role of the giant. The priority of Nato’s troops in the manoeuvre, said one officer, was to “delay the enemy”, not to hold the line. As Nato members prepare to meet in Madrid in June, Lithuania, along with its Baltic neighbour Estonia, is calling on Nato to urgently adjust its posture in the region from deterrence to what it calls “forward defence”. “What we’re seeing in Russia and Belarus is now a dangerous country with the intention to attack other sovereign states,” Landsbergis told the Guardian. “It’s a double-edged sword: on the one hand Russia has proven in Ukraine that it is a declining regional power. On the other hand, it can still do a lot of damage on its way down, as it seems to have no regard for its own losses. We have to defend the Baltic states, especially those that are geographically interesting to Russia.” In keeping with the “founding act”, a political agreement signed by Nato and Russia in 1997, there are restrictions on how many western allied troops are allowed to be deployed to the Baltics, and how close they can be stationed to the border. The enhanced forward presence in Lithuania, which is made up of seven European nations and led by Germany’s Bundeswehr, has to be rotated every six months at considerable cost and effort, with hundreds of vehicles having to be transported by road, rail or air before each changeover. While countries such as Germany and the UK remain committed to the founding act, Lithuania and other states in the region say the document is no longer viable as a treaty. “We consider it null and void after what Russia has done,” Landsbergis said. “The new reality we have to accept is that the treaties that built the old security environment with Russia are no more. We have to look at this with new eyes. There has to be a permanent military presence with everything needed to defend the skies, defend the seas and defend the land of the Baltic states.” Estonia’s prime minister last week called for the three Baltic states to be handed “war-fighting capabilities”, with divisions of up to 25,000 soldiers per country. “The question we have to ask ourselves is: what will be the new global security architecture of the world after this war?” said Landsbergis. “At the moment, we are merely reacting to what is happening in Ukraine. But that has to change. We have to start thinking in strategic terms.”",News/World news,Nato’s ‘achilles heel’: alliance conducts war games in nervous Lithuania,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/nato-achilles-heel-alliance-conducts-war-games-nervous-lithuania
4/11/2022,"Centrist Emmanuel Macron and the far-right Marine Le Pen are through to the second round of the French presidential election. Who are they and what do they stand for? Macron, 44, came to power in 2017 as France’s youngest president, pledging to redraw the political landscape with a pro-European, pro-business platform described as “neither left nor right”. He loosened strict labour laws and began what was seen as the biggest overhaul of France’s social model and welfare system in modern history, starting with tightening unemployment benefits. Macron, campaigning to become the first French president to win re-election in 20 years, says he has reduced unemployment to its lowest level in 15 years and that he could now bring France to full employment after decades of joblessness. He says that for the first time in 30 years, France is opening more factories that it is closing. He has promised to gradually raise the pension age from 62 to 65, an unpopular measure. Macron argues that it is necessary to keep the pensions system afloat. He has said he would raise minimum pensions to €1,100 (£920) a month and continue cutting taxes for businesses and households, including scrapping the licence fee for public service broadcasting. He would also centralise the benefits system. His promise that unemployed people on certain benefits must undertake 15-20 hours of activity a week has also sparked controversy. Macron began campaigning relatively late, saying he was instead engaged in diplomacy on the war in Ukraine. He is viewed in polls as trustworthy on handing crises. During the Covid pandemic, he turned to state interventionism and vast public spending to protect companies and households, boasting of “nationalising wages”, which the public backed. But although Macron has attempted to highlight his past social measures such as halving class sizes in primary schools in deprived areas or increasing paternity leave, he has struggled to shake off his image as aloof and a “president of the rich” – a label that has stuck to him since his first moves to transform the wealth tax into a property tax and cut corporate taxes. Le Pen, 53, is a far-right member of parliament for part of the Pas-de-Calais, in north-east France. This is her third attempt to become president; she lost to Macron in the final round in 2017. In 2011 Le Pen took over the anti-immigration, far-right Front National from her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen. She set about trying to sanitise its image from the jackbooted overtones of the past, though her political opponents argued that the party remained racist and xenophobic. In 2018 Le Pen renamed the party the National Rally, seeking to get rid of the martial imagery and broaden its appeal. Le Pen has focused her campaign on the cost of living crisis, which is voters’ top concern. She has vowed to lower VAT on fuel and energy from 20% to 5.5%. She would scrap income tax for everyone under the age of 30. She has promised to renationalise motorways, scrap the TV licence fee and privatise public service broadcasting. Le Pen has vowed to ban the Muslim headscarf from all public spaces, including the street, calling it a “uniform of totalitarian ideology”. She said: “People will be given a fine in the same way that it is illegal to not wear your seatbelt. It seems to me that the police are very much able to enforce this measure.” She has promised a referendum on immigration, which she says would lead to a rewrite of the constitution to ensure a “France for the French” – where native French people would be prioritised over non-French people for benefits, housing, jobs and healthcare. She would remove the right of children born in France to foreign parents to obtain French nationality in their teenage years. She has dropped her previous promise to leave the euro and quit the European Union, but has vowed to cut French EU budget contributions and renegotiate treaties in a way that her opponents say would lead to France being isolated or cut out of the bloc.",News/World news,Macron v Le Pen: who are the candidates in the French election runoff?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/macron-v-le-pen-who-are-the-candidates-in-the-french-election-runoff
4/11/2022,"Residents and visitors can enjoy cheaper trips around the far south-west of England after the launch of a cut-price bus fare pilot in Cornwall. Ticket prices across the county have been reduced by between 20% and 40% in an attempt to encourage more people out of their cars and on to public transport. The four-year scheme, which is backed by the government, will measure what impact lower fares have on the number of cars on the road. It is hoped it will make it easier for Cornish people to get around and also tempt visitors to visit the county’s beaches, moors, towns and attractions by bus rather than car. Louis Gardner, the mayor of Newquay, was among those who welcomed the scheme. He said: “The bus fares pilot is a hugely positive step for the people of Cornwall. This will make it easier for young people to access jobs, education and training in towns such as Newquay. “It’s important for rural communities to have access to affordable alternatives to the car. It will also benefit tourists this summer and could encourage them to use public transport, rather than going everywhere by car.” Transport for Cornwall has set a goal of increasing bus usage by 10% and is using a £23.5m grant from the Department for Transport to fund the initiative. The new fares will include: £2.50 a day or £10 a week for adults within Cornish towns. £5 a day or £20 a week for adults for travel across Cornwall. Adult singles from £1.60, and returns from £2.40. Family tickets for £10 a day (up to two adults and unlimited children under 16). The transport minister Charlotte Vere said: “The launch of this excellent scheme across Cornwall is a significant moment in our ambition to level up transport links across the country. We want to place Cornwall at the leading edge of a national bus revolution.” The largest bus operator in Cornwall, Go-Ahead Group, is leading the scheme, but under an initiative called “any ticket, any bus” the cheaper prices will mean benefits for customers of all the main companies. While the scheme is scheduled to last four years, it cannot be guaranteed that the prices will stay at the levels set and they may be tweaked depending on how the services are used. David Sidebottom, the director of the watchdog Transport Focus, said: “Cheaper fares are vital in winning passengers back and attracting new ones. Our research has shown that Cornwall’s bus passengers wanted better value for money fares. These plans should drive up passenger satisfaction and encourage more people to give bus a go. We will monitor the impact this has on passengers.”",News/UK news,Cornish pilot scheme cuts bus fares to encourage use of public transport,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/cornwall-pilot-scheme-cuts-bus-fares-public-transport
