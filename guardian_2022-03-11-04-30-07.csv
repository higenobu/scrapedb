3/11/2022,"Grimes and Elon Musk welcomed a second child, a girl named Exa Dark Sideræl Musk, via surrogate in December, the singer revealed in a wide-ranging interview with Vanity Fair published Thursday. The Canadian singer, born Claire Boucher, was initially reluctant to reveal the couple’s second child, nicknamed “Y”, but during an interview at her home in Austin, Texas, Vanity Fair journalist Devin Gordon overheard a baby crying. When asked if she had a new baby in her life, the futurist pop singer initially said she wasn’t “at liberty to speak on these things” but then confirmed Y joined the family in December, and eventually shared her full name. The on-again, off-again couple – “I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we’re very fluid,” she told Vanity Fair – welcomed their first child, X Æ A-12 (pronounced “X AI Archangel” and nicked “X”), in May 2020. Grimes told Vanity Fair that the name Exa refers to the supercomputing term exaFLOPS, or the ability to perform 1 quintillion floating-point operations a second. Dark, she said, represents “the unknown. People fear it but truly it’s the absence of photons. Dark matter is the beautiful mystery of our universe.” Sideræl is pronounced “sigh-deer-ee-el” and is a “more elven” spelling of sidereal, “the true time of the universe, star time, deep space time, not our relative earth time”. The name also honors her favorite Lord of the Rings character Galadriel, who “chooses to abdicate the ring”. Grimes expressed throughout the interview a desire to keep her daughter’s likeness and details private; following its publication, she tweeted: “I did this to speak abt my work, not ‘reveal all’ haha. Def held back a lot, contrary 2 headline. & didn’t mean for them 2 find out about my daughter so please respect her privacy as I’d love her to be able to live as private of a life as possible.” She also added in a separate tweet that she and Musk, a billionaire who also founded SpaceX and NeuraLink, among other tech companies, had “broken up *again* since the writing of this article haha, but he’s my best friend and the love of my life, and my life and art are forever dedicated to The Mission now, I think Devin wrote that part of the story rly well”.",Arts/Music,Grimes and Elon Musk welcomed second child via surrogate in December,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/10/grimes-elon-musk-second-child-y
3/11/2022,"Just as Russian tanks were starting to roll into Ukraine, Rishi Sunak revealed himself to be a Thatcherite in trainers. His Mais lecture last month was a paean to his heroine’s philosophy. Yet the past decade has shown this creed to have been a failure in the light of its original aims. It has not increased productivity. It has not led to lower inflation. It has not seen the national debt fall. Mr Sunak says the problem is that businesses won’t invest – yet why would they if sales are drying up? Thatcherism’s economic legacy has seen wages stagnate, insecure work increase and the government starved of resources. Rather than rethink, Mr Sunak dug his heels in. In his speech he called for a “new culture of enterprise” and lower taxes to promote growth. But this has been on the song sheet of every chancellor since 1979. Mr Sunak may be reverting to type because of a largely forgotten component of Thatcherism that may prove useful in the years ahead. Margaret Thatcher came to power after a decade of economic problems. In the 1970s, these were captured by the portmanteau “stagflation” to describe what happened when high unemployment and high inflation rates occurred simultaneously. In most nations, the double-digit inflation of the 1970s was caused by oil shocks. Thatcherism’s insight was to shift blame for price rises away from commodity producers to high public spending. Mr Sunak faces a not dissimilar situation as the cost of fuel and food surges. Things are getting more expensive. Either the government or households or companies or some mixture of the three will pick up the tab. The chancellor’s lecture outlines an anti-state, pro-corporate political programme that could be sustained while household finances deteriorate. This may be framed as the price the British public must pay to defeat Vladimir Putin. The Resolution Foundation forecasts that higher than expected inflation will see a typical household’s income drop by £1,000 this year – the biggest real-terms fall in incomes since the mid-1970s. But this is unnecessary suffering. Mr Putin won’t be defeated by such needless pieties. The budget is set for 23 March. Mr Sunak should act before then and set out how he intends to deal with falling living standards. There are plenty of good ideas around. Instead of offering more tax deductions for companies, Mr Sunak ought to take a leaf out of Labour’s book and impose a one-off windfall tax on oil companies to fund lower bills for consumers. He needs to be more generous to help with gas bills in the face of soaring wholesale prices, especially for poorer families. The government should uprate benefits in line with higher inflation costs so that workers and pensioners are protected from a potential £10bn real-terms loss. Ministers could, as suggested by the Institute for Public Policy Research, protect incomes by raising the minimum wage level or paying public sector staff more. Now is not the time for ideological peacocking. There is no place for balanced budgets today. Hiking interest rates will not bring down inflation caused by disruptions to supply. Price rises will end when their sources – found in the post-pandemic disorder and war in Ukraine – subside. The UK needs energy security, not worker insecurity. There are enough onshore wind and solar projects granted planning permission to make up for the shortfall caused by banning Russian energy imports. But ministers have yet to back them. Mr Sunak should adjust his policies in the light of developing circumstances. To ignore what is happening and go on as before might be acceptable if the basic premises upon which his policy is founded were right. But they are wrong and are damaging Britain.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Rishi Sunak’s politics: profits above wages | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/10/the-guardian-view-on-rishi-sunaks-politics-profits-above-wages
3/11/2022,"The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, has withdrawn his letter of no confidence in Boris Johnson, citing the war in Ukraine and saying it was no time for a change of leadership. Ross, who has been an outspoken critic of the prime minister, had criticised him over lockdown parties in Downing Street. Johnson, along with dozens of staff and officials, is under police investigation for the breaches. But on Thursday Ross said he had withdrawn his letter of no confidence sent to the party’s 1922 committee chair Sir Graham Brady. A total of 54 letters are needed to trigger a vote on Johnson’s leadership. Ross’ declaration of no confidence was endorsed by the Conservative group at Holyrood. Signs that relations between Johnson and Ross had begun to thaw began after it was announced the prime minister will attend the Scottish Conservative conference in Aberdeen on 18 and 19 March. Ross told the BBC that “the middle of an international crisis is not the time to be discussing resignations” but signalled there would be a time to return to Johnson’s fitness to be prime minister. He added: “There will be a time and place to debate partygate but, as even Keir Starmer said at the weekend, we should put that on pause while there is war in Europe. “It’s essential that we all fully support what the UK government is doing. In light of Russia’s appalling actions, the government and prime minister need our backing, and they have mine and the whole Scottish Conservative party.” The SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, called it “an utterly humiliating U-turn for Douglas Ross” and said he would now “roll out the carpet for the prime minister at the Scottish Conservative conference and pretend that the no-confidence letter that he submitted with such fanfare never happened”. The Metropolitan police are still examining evidence collected by the Cabinet Office investigation, led by senior civil servant Sue Gray, into lockdown breaches in No 10 and the Cabinet Office. More than 80 questionnaires are understood to have been submitted to potential rule-breakers, including the prime minister. Johnson is said to have attended at least six of the gatherings under investigation and one took place in his own Downing Street flat. Police are not expected to report for several weeks, after which the Cabinet Office has said Gray will release a full copy of her inquiry, which was held back while police investigated.",News/Politics,Scottish Tory leader withdraws letter of no confidence in Boris Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/10/scottish-tory-leader-withdraws-letter-of-no-confidence-in-boris-johnson
3/11/2022,"Culture has long been a proxy in the assertion of power by one people over another. Recent egregious examples include the Chinese government’s attempt to suppress Uyghur religion, literature, music, even food, and Islamic State’s destruction of ancient monuments. In war, culture is a second front. At their most extreme, wars are about eradicating a people’s cultural memory altogether, wiping them from the slate as if they had never been. That Vladimir Putin should have prefaced his invasion with a speech falsely framing Ukraine as essentially Russian is on the one hand a spurious justification for invasion, and on the other an attempt to seize, simplify and own a complex historical narrative about the two intertwined but distinct nations. However, Mr Putin has been outsmarted by his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The former comedian, who had never held office before his 2019 election, has, remarkably, been a persuasive rhetorician and war leader. On the other hand, a career in acting is perhaps exactly what was required for him to step so convincingly into this new role. He is not the only one to make such a leap. A potent symbol of the ploughshares-to-swords shift of Ukraine is the fact that ballet dancers from Kyiv’s national opera house have joined the fight. Elsewhere, symbols of Ukrainian resistance – the sunflower, and the blue and yellow of the national flag – have been deployed internationally to moving effect. And acts of fellowship – making Ukrainian food, for example, as part of the UK-based Cook for Ukraine humanitarian fundraising effort – have their own simple and practical power. “If we lose our culture, we lose our identity,” Lilya Onyshchenko, the head of Lviv’s city council heritage protection office, told the Guardian. Ms Onyshchenko went on to emphasise that the city in western Ukraine had always been multicultural. It is not clear what Mr Putin’s intentions are, precisely, in relation to Ukraine’s assertion of its own identity. But the understandable fear is that Russian expansion seeks to colonise minds as well as places. In some ways, intentions are less important than effects, amid war’s messy reality. A missile strike in Kyiv that reportedly killed five people was seemingly directed at the television tower, but it lies close to Babyn Yar, the site of the massacre of 150,000 people during the second world war, including 30,000 Jews – a great irony given Mr Putin’s stated ambition to “denazify” Ukraine. An attack on the town of Ivankiv, 50 miles north-west of Kyiv, set afire the town’s Historical and Local History Museum, destroying precious works by the 20th-century folk artist Maria Prymachenko. The artist is an important symbol of Ukrainian art – and Ukrainian hope. Three decades ago, war in the former Yugoslavia saw sacred and beautiful places such as Dubrovnik or the Mostar bridge and old town targeted, sometimes with the intention of erasing the evidence that people of another religion or ethnicity had once lived there. Whether or not sites like Babyn Yar and Ivankiv’s museum have been collateral damage rather than actual targets, the cultural front in war is never trivial. This is a conflict, like so many others, that’s not just about controlling territory – but owning narrative.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Ukraine’s cultural heritage: a second front | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/10/the-guardian-view-on-ukraines-cultural-heritage-a-second-front
3/11/2022,"Priti Patel has faced days of public and private opprobrium before the Home Office’s abrupt U-turn to halt Ukrainian visa appointments for passport holders on Thursday. But has the prime minister already lost faith in the home secretary? One cabinet source said Boris Johnson had been perturbed by the volume of negative headlines around the low number of refugees being granted visas – and speculated that Patel’s future would again come under discussion at the summer reshuffle. They pointed in particular to the cover of this week’s Spectator magazine – which Johnson used to edit – which featured a cartoon comparing the UK’s bureaucratic response with that of other EU nations. “Priti is fundamentally opposed to a more liberal system, yes, but the other issue is that she just cannot do effective, fast-paced delivery,” another MP said. Allies of the home secretary say that is deeply unfair, arguing officials are pulling 15-hour days to set up new systems from scratch and respond to changing humanitarian and security pictures. They predict a significant surge in visa numbers by the end of the week to about 5,000. The change Patel announced in response to an urgent question in the Commons on Thursday – to remove the need for visa appointments from Ukrainians with passports – was hastily drafted over the past 24 hours when officials realised the sheer scale of the bottleneck in visa centres that are normally equipped to deal only with a handful of student or work permits. It has been a week of punishing criticism for the home secretary from her own MPs in parliament, including claims that had to be retracted about staffing in Calais and appointment wait times. Distraught families were banging the windows of the Rzeszów visa centre’s windows when staff told them were only able to see to 100 applications in one day. The Tory MP Roger Gale said that her behaviour this week would “have been a resigning matter under any normal administration”. Another, Alec Shelbrooke, told the immigration minister, Kevin Foster, that the operation of the scheme was “a disgrace”. On Tuesday, sources said Patel was given an uncomfortable grilling by cabinet ministers about the UK’s response at their weekly meeting. One cabinet source said it was “not a slanging match but more like an interrogation”. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, cross-examined Patel repeatedly on the details of what was on offer and how support could be accessed. “She floundered a bit,” the source said. Others who have expressed frustration at the management of the scheme are the foreign secretary, Liz Truss; the defence secretary, Ben Wallace; and the health secretary, Sajid Javid. On Wednesday, Javid’s department organised a separate plane to bring about 20 critically ill children to the UK for treatment. Several cabinet ministers have let their frustrations out during on air interviews when they have been repeatedly quizzed on the failures. Shapps told broadcasters that “lessons will be learned” about how the response can be co-ordinated. A Patel ally did not deny there were tensions with the prime minister but said they did not think the home secretary had lost his confidence. “The PM just wakes up and looks at the headlines and then moans about it,” they said. “Generally they have a pretty good relationship compared to almost anyone. “She’ll come speak to him, they see eye-to-eye on a lot. She likes him and she’s taken a lot of blows for him. But of course it’s difficult when there are just volumes of these tragic stories every single day in every paper.” Backbenchers describe feeling as if they have been slamming into a brick wall. Patel was urged internally to hold a video conference to explain the visa system to MPs but decided instead to send a “dear colleague” letter. There were also plans for her to do a her own statement in the chamber, but events have forced announcements to be made at multiple urgent questions in the House of Commons. There is a widespread view among MPs and officials that a wider Home Office culture – beyond Patel – is also at fault. One Whitehall source said the Home Office officials genuinely believed its main issues was communication. “If you’ve got people banging on the doors of the office in Poland, that’s more than a comms problem.” A constant redrafting of the visa conditions has led to officials needing to hold thrice-daily briefings – more than any other situation has merited since Patel took over. One Whitehall source said there was a genuine security concerns, citing discoveries of fake Ukrainian passports on sale. “Over there are these Chechens groups, the Wagner Group mercenaries – her critics just aren’t seeing the stuff she’s seeing,” the source said. Others named a combination of difficult delivery, inflexibility and ideology for the endless negative headlines. “Fundamentally, cutting immigration dominates people’s thinking,” a former official said. “They see their job, from when they wake up in the morning, as stopping people getting into this country. “But actually, that’s not their job. Their job is to enforce our immigration policy – which does include letting some people in. Senior people are in that building now, reading these horrendous stories in the press and they are like, argh, fuck, why is this happening again? But if the general culture is to find ways of keeping people out, it’s not a surprise really.”",News/Politics,Is Priti Patel’s career in trouble after a week of punishing criticism?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/10/priti-patel-career-cabinet-reshuffle-ukraine
3/11/2022,"Emmanuel Macron has led western European leaders in rebuffing appeals from Volodymyr Zelenskiy for fast-track EU membership for Ukraine despite the backing of eastern member states. At a summit in Versailles, the 27 EU countries acknowledged as one the “tectonic shift in European history” caused by Russia’s invasion of its neighbour and vowed to bolster their military might and “strengthen our bonds and deepen our partnership” with Kyiv. But calls from Ukraine’s president, supported by Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, for a special membership process failed to convince France, Germany, Spain or the Netherlands. France’s president said he wanted to “send a strong signal in this period to Ukraine and to the Ukrainians” of solidarity but “at the same time, we must be vigilant”, adding that he did not believe it possible to “open an accession procedure with a country at war”. “Should we close the door and say never, it would be unfair,” he said. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, told reporters there was no prospect of the EU membership for Ukraine in the short term. He said: “All countries in the western part of Europe that I speak to say that you shouldn’t try to have a fast-track procedure or accelerated accession process … “What’s important is that Ukraine has asked to be member of the EU … There is no fast-track procedure to become a member of the EU.” Western European governments opposed to rushing to EU candidacy status are concerned by the widespread corruption in Ukraine, the lack of stability in its institutions, and its parlous economic state. The experience in being unable to act in relation to the democratic deficit in Hungary and Poland has put off a number of capitals from any enlargement before big reforms of the bloc’s decision-making mechanisms. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, suggested that the EU was not ready for enlargement as its decision-making was still rooted in unanimity. There was no immediate response from Kyiv. The EU member states have asked the European Commission to give an assessment of Ukraine’s membership application, which could take up to 18 months to complete. The Latvian prime minister, Krisjanis Karins, whose country shares a border with Russia, said Ukraine should join the Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey in being granted candidate status, although that would be the start of a “long road” to membership. “It is important to show a clear, open door for EU membership for Ukraine, that the path is open for them to take,” he said. The leaders were meeting in France just hours after talks between Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in Turkey ended in stalemate. Macron, who has staged a number of lengthy calls with Putin before and after Russia’s president launched his invasion, told reporters he would continue to talk with Moscow but that he was not hopeful of a breakthrough. He said: “I do not see a diplomatic solution in the next few hours or the next few days, but we will speak again with President Putin in the next few days, try to see if things move on either side, and so we will continue to remain engaged with a lot of strength … “I have to confess that the conditions that he puts on the table aren’t acceptable to anybody, to be honest. “The questions is whether Mr Putin is ready to engage himself and we will work genuinely collectively … When I look at the facts, the facts are the following: Russia decided to launch war; Russia has bombed Ukraine; Russia is bombing civilians; and in parallel you have negotiations, but the negotiations are not ready to be completed.” He described the Russian airstrike on a Mariupol maternity hospital as a “a shameful and amoral act of war”. Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said Putin was engaged in a “crazy war” and was “indiscriminately” shelling civilians and “bombing and destroying a country” as it had done in Syria. The EU’s leaders discussed a variety of ways in which economic and political ties could be strengthened with Ukraine, ranging from a seat for the Ukrainian leadership at some EU meetings to membership of the Erasmus student exchange programme. They also focused on how to reduce the bloc’s dependency on Russian gas and oil. In 2021, the EU imported 155bn cubic metres of natural gas from Russia, accounting for about 45% of its gas imports and close to 40% of the bloc’s total gas consumption. The EU has already imposed unprecedented punitive measures on key parts of the Russian economy and hundreds of politicians, officials and oligarchs. According to a draft summit communique seen by the Guardian, the leaders are expected to warn Moscow that they “are ready to move quickly with further sanctions if needed”. In Moscow, Putin warned that their sanctions against Russia would rebound by raising the price of food and energy. He said: “These sanctions would have been imposed in any case. There are some questions, problems and difficulties, but in the past we have overcome them and we will overcome them now. “In the end, this will all lead to an increase in our independence, self-sufficiency and our sovereignty.”",News/World news,Western Europe leaders rebuff Ukraine fast-track EU membership appeal,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/western-europe-leaders-rebuff-ukraine-fast-track-eu-membership-appeal
3/11/2022,"Cricket is “facing a reckoning” as a result of the Azeem Rafiq affair and needs to take a long look in the mirror when it comes to discrimination, the chair of the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket (ICEC) has said. After launching a call for written evidence for her independent report, which is due to be published this autumn, Cindy Butts said the ICEC had received a “staggering” response to an initial online survey, with more than 4,000 people coming forward to detail their experiences of discrimination on the basis of race, gender and class. Butts stressed she was unable to talk in detail about those findings as the results were still being processed, but said: “What is clear is that all is not well in cricket. Cricket is facing a reckoning. It has to grasp this opportunity to understand and diagnose what the problem is. And then recommend – in an evidence-based way – what the solutions are to its problems. That is abundantly clear. “Cricket needs to really look in the mirror. It has to say: ‘This is what we look like and we are prepared to tackle the issues that are prevalent within the sport in a concerted, serious and considered way.’ We hope that, through our report, we will be able to help the sport to move forward into a much more positive place.” The aim of the commission is to identify the actions the England and Wales Cricket Board will need to take to tackle these issues. However, Butt said Rafiq’s bravery in coming forward had been influential in the first stage of the listening process. “People were spurred on by Azeem Rafiq’s experiences, and issues in relation to race in particular, going on in cricket,” she said. “That gave people the courage to come forward and to speak about their own experiences. It was an indication of people being incredibly concerned about what’s going on – and wanting to contribute to make things better.” The commission, whose formation was announced in November 2020, is now seeking written evidence from people across cricket to focus on issues such as the leadership of the sport, as well as its culture and talent pathways. Those wanting to contribute are being urged to do so by 20 April. “We’re looking at good practices, culture, complaints and obviously governance and leadership, not just in terms of the ECB but the counties too,” Butts said.",Sport/Sport,"Cricket faces discrimination ‘reckoning’, warns independent report chair",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/10/cricket-is-facing-a-reckoning-chair-of-icec-says-major-change-needed
3/11/2022,"Twelve days after witnessing his home in Kharkiv being shelled by Russian forces, Sergei Koletvinov, a London-based van driver, was stopped at the Calais ferry entrance and told he could not take his family into Britain without a visa. He was turned back at 2.30am on Thursday morning, and spent the rest of the night trying to sleep in his car with his wife, Oxana Lubeinoko, their two-and-a-half year old son, Simon, and their five-year-old daughter, Alissa, while parked outside a temporary Home Office advice centre in the port, turning the engine on occasionally to keep warm. They had consulted friends and Facebook sites and were under the impression that because he has permanent residency in the UK, they would have no problem crossing the border. A few metres away in the same car park, Svitlana Apanasenko, from Kyiv, who is eight months pregnant and nervous about going into premature labour, was also trying to get some sleep, squashed inside a minibus with seven other people. Her family had been turned back at the border in the early hours as well, halting an already long and stressful journey to safety. On Thursday, amid international outcry over the UK’s slow and restrictive visa arrangements for Ukrainian refugees, the home secretary, Priti Patel, announced a modest reduction of the red tape involved. From next Tuesday, refugees fleeing the Russian invasion will no longer have to get their fingerprints and photographs done before travelling to the UK, and will be able to complete the application once they have arrived in Britain. The announcement followed an earlier incremental expansion of the Ukraine family visa scheme on Tuesday, extending it from immediate family to cousins, aunts, uncles and in-laws of UK-based relatives. However, these tweaks to an exacting bureaucratic process were criticised by Amnesty International as “too little, too late, and yet more evidence of the Home Office’s corrosively anti-refugee attitude”. “The process is still full of red tape, with desperate and exhausted people still being required to provide birth certificates, proof of relationships and residence, and with everything still needing to be translated into English,” said Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK’s chief executive, as he called for a full visa waiver. Because they will only begin next week, the changes offered little comfort to the hundreds of refugees currently stuck in northern France while they try to get appointments in UK visa application centres in Paris, or across the border in Belgium, before facing a wait of up to five days to see if their application is approved. Throughout Wednesday night and Thursday morning, Ukrainian refugees continued to be turned away at the UK border at the Calais ferry port. By 11am, Koletvinov had been seen by some Home Office staff, and was waiting to be taken by bus to Lille with his family to submit biometric data for the visa at a temporary centre. No one was able to tell him how long the application process might take. The family had eaten nothing since Wednesday except for Kit Kats offered by UK border officials. “This has been the worst time of my life,” he said, grey-faced and trembling from exhaustion, scrolling through messages on his phone, showing images of the ruined buildings near his block of flats, every window blown out. He said he was too tired to feel anger at the unexpected bureaucracy preventing the family from crossing the Channel. Koletvinov, who has been working in the UK for eight years, spending a few weeks a year with his wife and children in Ukraine, was with his family when the Russian attack began; they took just 15 minutes to pack up and leave. He said the uncertainty over when or whether they would be granted visas was hard to process. “We still don’t know what’s happening,” he said. His children busied themselves with colouring books and crayons on the floor of the port building, climbing over and under the waiting room’s metal seats, oblivious to their parents’ unease. He plans to rent a bigger flat in London and find better-paid work to support his family. “We’re not asking for anything; we just want to be safe,” he said. Alla Berliuta, an assistant at a care home in Southampton, had spent the last week driving with her husband, Andrii, an alarm fitter, who like her has permanent residency in the UK, to rescue relatives from a town just outside Kyiv. She collected her heavily pregnant sister, Svitlana Apanasenko, her 15-year-old niece, a sister-in-law, a brother-in-law and a two-year-old nephew, from the border with Moldova, but they were forced to reroute via Romania to visit a UK visa application centre there and be fingerprinted. The hurdles required to secure a UK visa have slowed them down and heightened the stressfulness of the experience. “No one understands the visa system. It’s so new and we were given different advice at different times. My brain feels a bit boiled by everything. I’ve been so worried about my sister because her pregnancy has been very complicated and she needs a caesarean,” Berliuta said. She was also worried that the visa-related delays to the journey would put her care-worker job at risk, although she said that her employers, Allied Healthcare, had been very understanding. Because the family had already visited the visa appointment centre in Romania, Home Office staff were able to finalise their visas, and they were able to board a ferry to the UK early on Thursday afternoon. Elsewhere in Calais, however, other Ukrainian families were still waiting. The French interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, has accused Britain of being “a bit inhumane” and urged ministers to “stop the technocratic nitpicking”, a stance that was echoed by several refugees. “The response has been far too slow and far too complicated,” Taras Bednarchuk said, furious to have been turned away from the Eurotunnel by UK Border Force staff. He and his brother Misha, both of whom are long-term UK residents and work in construction, had driven to Warsaw to collect their 17-year-old brother, who had been studying software engineering in Ternopil in Ukraine before fleeing; they had not realised he would need a visa. Vera Pitchuk, who has been working as a cleaner in London for the past six months, had collected her two sons, five and nine, from Ukraine, where they were being looked after by their grandmother, and brought them to Calais by coach from Poland. Her family and 10 other refugees were taken off the coach at the UK passport control at the ferry port because they had no visas. They had been obliged to travel from Calais back to Paris to submit an application there on Wednesday and were waiting to hear if they would be granted entry; it was not clear whether she was eligible for the family scheme, which does not apply to workers on short-term visas. “I hope everything will be fine. We have already been through a lot,” she said. A new visa application centre will be opened on Friday in Arras, 70 miles east of Calais, the Home Office announced, in order to keep refugees away from the port city. “To support those people in Calais who are eligible for the scheme, we have worked closely with the French to set up a new, larger temporary visa application centre in Arras for referrals only,” a spokesperson said. Officials said that more than 1,000 UK visas had now been granted in centres across Europe.

3/11/2022,"On Monday, Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Calvin Ridley was suspended for a full season for wagering on NFL games. The league’s investigation, which found that Ridley made the bets while he was away from the team to concentrate on his mental health in November, said there was no reason to suggest Ridley had used inside information or influenced the outcome of any games. The NFL also said it was satisfied no other members of the Falcons were involved. What Ridley did is wrong. Yes, the penalty feels harsh: he will lose a year of his athletic prime and $11m in salary over what he said was $1,500 in bets. And the proportionality raises eyebrows given the lesser punishments meted out for cheating scandals, lying about Covid vaccination status, literal child abuse and unspeakable acts of gender-based violence. But you can’t bet on your own sport, much less on your own team, and the NFL clearly needed to set a precedent. Still, there’s something that feels off about making Ridley a splashy example at a time when the NFL is raking in millions of dollars in revenue from gambling, something it regarded as a corrosive element and fought tooth and nail against not that long ago. It is a dramatic pivot to go from a century’s worth of moral policing to, effectively, becoming a sportsbook with a bit of football on the side. For years the NFL adhered to the firewall between American sports and gambling that went up with the 1919 Black Sox scandal, one perhaps informed by the nation’s puritanical roots but implemented in the face of existential crisis. That firewall was only reinforced with each passing generation’s scandal: the CCNY point-shaving imbroglio, Tulane basketball, Pete Rose and Tim Donaghy. The NFL’s resolve to insulate football from sports betting only redoubled in 1963, when Green Bay Packers halfback Paul Hornung and Detroit Lions defensive tackle Alex Karras were suspended indefinitely for wagering on games. Until recently NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, the milquetoast cipher who has earned more than $375m in salary during a decade-and-a-half-long tenure as a human shield for the cadre of billionaire owners he represents, toed the decades-old line and was unequivocal on where pro football stood on the subject even as public attitudes shifted. In 2009, Goodell described even a watered-down version of sports gambling as “an additional threat to the integrity of our league and contrary to the public good”. In 2017, on the day when the league’s owners approved the Raiders’ move from Oakland to Las Vegas, the commissioner left no doubt: “I think we still strongly oppose legalized sports gambling. The integrity of our game is No 1. We will not compromise that.” But these days? Since the 2018 Supreme Court ruling that opened up sports betting around the country, the NFL’s hypocrisy has been laid bare. Turns out all those decades of moralizing didn’t have a thing to do with integrity, upholding the public good or “protecting the shield”: the NFL just wanted their piece of the action. Like most conservative-leaning cultural leviathans the NFL is slow-moving, which has made the raw speed of its about-face on gambling extraordinary. But it comes as no surprise. All sports leagues have gone through some degree of hand-wringing over attracting younger fans as their older core ages out and not even the NFL has been immune. If the end goal is “engagement”, the NFL clearly no longer cares whether your investment is the emotional pull of an allegiance to a team or the financial dopamine hit of an eight-leg parlay. ESPN, one the league’s billion-dollar television partners, began featuring point spreads on its BottomLine ticker. Game broadcasts which rarely mentioned odds or point spreads for decades with anything more than a wink and a nod have since been flooded with advertisements for “risk-free” promos where the first one is free. (It always is.) Goodell said it best on a visit to Las Vegas in 2020: “We think that sports gambling in many ways creates a lot more engagement for our fans. It gives them another opportunity to engage with the game.” It’s also enriched the NFL’s owners by opening the floodgates to new revenue streams of shocking value. Last year the NFL announced five-year contracts worth nearly $1bn combined with DraftKings, FanDuel and Caesars to become the league’s official sports betting partners, in addition to secondary deals with BetMGM, WynnBET, Fox Bet and PointsBet. It’s not hard to see where this is all headed, mainly because it’s right there in black and white in the collective bargaining agreement between the NFL and its players’ union signed during the pandemic. Over the next 10 years, owners and players will share revenues generated “by the operation of gambling-related businesses located in or physically attached to an NFL Stadium”. The language all but assures a future with sportsbooks inside stadiums – less than two decades after the NFL refused to air a commercial from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority promoting the city’s tourism. The NFL’s hypocrisy is barely newsworthy anymore, but the commissioner’s paternalistic letter informing Ridley of his suspension was a groaner even by Goodell standards. “There is nothing more fundamental to the NFL’s success – and to the reputation of everyone associated with our league – than upholding the integrity of the game,” the letter read. “This is the responsibility of every player, coach, owner, game official, and anyone else employed in the league. Your actions put the integrity of the game at risk, threatened to damage public confidence in professional football, and potentially undermined the reputations of your fellow players throughout the NFL.” Which brings us back to Ridley, who deserves to be held accountable for his mistake in judgment. But there’s no question mixed messages are being sent at a time when the NFL is profiting from sports betting in a fashion that would have been unthinkable even five years ago. Even if it makes them complicit in an activity that at best warps minds and at worst ruins lives.",Sport/Sport,The NFL doesn’t want players gambling but is happy to gorge on the proceeds,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/10/calvin-ridley-nfl-atlanta-falcons-gambling-nfl-football-suspension
3/11/2022,"Agreed, Russian gas bad – but George Monbiot’s attack on Germany, Europe’s largest economy, seems deeply misplaced (It’s not too late to free ourselves from this idiotic addiction to Russian gas, 9 March). The German energy transition is all about replacing conventional power plants, fissile as well as fossil fuel, with renewables. Looking at both short- and mid-term energy scenarios, Germany decided that the costs and risks of keeping nuclear outweighed the limited benefits. Meanwhile, worldwide, renewables are exponentially ramping up, and nuclear declining. Global renewable electricity capacity is forecast to increase by over 60% between 2020 and 2026, reaching more than 4,800GW. This is equivalent to the current global power capacity of fossil fuels and nuclear combined. And here’s the killer: Russia produces about 35% of the world’s enriched uranium for nuclear reactors, and the EU’s uranium imports from Russia equal those from Niger, at 2,545 tonnes. The Fukushima disaster made Monbiot pro-nuclear and now military attack on nuclear in Ukraine makes him even more so. Good luck with that.Dr Paul DorfmanAssociate fellow, Science Policy Research Unit, University of Sussex  What on earth does George Monbiot mean when he refers to small modular reactors as “kinder nuclear technologies”? SMRs are still vulnerable to accidents and attack (think of what happened in Ukraine); they still produce more nuclear waste per unit of electricity than conventional reactors; and there is still no safe, long-term solution for radioactive waste. Additionally, these reactors will remain dependent on uranium for fuel – when we know that uranium mining has caused suffering and death to mainly indigenous people across the world.Rae StreetLittleborough, Greater Manchester  George Monbiot makes a convincing argument for “the comprehensive energy transition that should have happened years ago”. He concludes by asking “So what are we waiting for?” We are waiting for another comprehensive transition – from our enslavement to the mysterious deity called “the market”, which also should have happened years ago.John AirsLiverpool  Michael Gove backs a new commission to explore tidal energy (Severn estuary tidal energy plan back on agenda amid Ukraine crisis, 8 March), and reveals a government racked by incompetence.

The government failed to back it in 2018.Roger CritchleyWest Bridgford, Nottinghamshire  Re Larry Elliott’s analysis (West feeling impact of Russia sanctions too as oil and gas prices soar, 7 March), we could reduce consumption of oil, limit our dependency on supplies from Russia and deny revenues to Putin if we reduced speed limits on the roads. When the speed of a petrol-engined car is reduced from 70mph to its optimal speed of 55mph to 60mph, its petrol consumption falls by 17%. Given that demand for road transport fuels in the UK is around 44m litres of petrol and 81m litres of diesel per day, that brings petrol consumption down by 7.5m litres and diesel by 13.8m litres per day. If the Nato allies were to agree such a strategy, they could inflict a sizeable cut in the financial support being provided for Putin’s war.David WalkerSheffield  Regarding your report (Joe Biden bans Russian oil imports in powerful blow to Putin’s war machine, 8 March), imagine if the US had not withdrawn from the Iranian nuclear accord, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA), in 2018. Today, there would be no discussion about oil prices rising to such high levels. Before the withdrawal, Iran was producing 2m to 2.5m barrels a day, with the potential to reach 3.5m to 4m. A return to the JCPOA and the return of Iranian oil to the world markets are vital for a successful grinding down of the Russian economy.Fariborz S FatemiMcLean, Virginia, USA  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/11/2022,"The recent report by the children’s commissioner found that there is little knowledge about children who are not enrolled in state schools, including how many are missing out on their entitlement to formal, full-time education (No one knows how many children in England, says children’s commissioner, 9 March). Our research using anonymised data on 1 million children in English state schools found that non-enrolment particularly affects the most vulnerable children: those who are in care or supported by children’s social care services. One in 10 children who had been in care at any time between the ages of eight and 14 became unenrolled from state school during the GCSE years between 14 and 16 years old. For those who ever received any help from social care, one in 15 were not enrolled. This compares with one in 40 children who were never involved with social care services aged eight to 14. The rates of non-enrolment were even higher for those who had ever received help for special educational needs as well as social care support. In other words, the very children who have been recognised by social care services and schools as being most in need of help are the most likely to fall through the safety net and miss out on education. Much more needs to be done to retain all children inclusively in education, including ensuring that schools have the resources to meet the often complex needs of the vulnerable children they care for.Matthew A JayLouise Mc Grath-LoneUCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Young people need examples of all types of positive, loving relationships, same-sex and otherwise, to help them make informed choices about their own relationships. Restricting access to such information can create a culture of secrecy, fear and confusion. Some members of the Catholic church have relied on such a toxic, closed culture to let them get away with horrific acts of abuse against young people for many years.

3/11/2022,"He is said to be Vladimir Putin’s favourite industrialist, with deep links among the British and Russian establishments. Unlike some of his countrymen, Oleg Deripaska has cultivated influence quietly, preferring to stay out of the spotlight. Yet the metals magnate has found himself at the heart of a string of high-profile political rows, culminating in Thursday’s decision by the UK government to add him to the list of individuals hit with sanctions in response to the war in Ukraine. The British rationale is that Deripaska is “a prominent Russian businessman and pro-Kremlin oligarch” who is “closely associated with the government of Russia and Vladimir Putin”, according to his entry on the sanctions list. “Deripaska is or has been involved in obtaining benefit from or supporting the government of Russia,” it states, by virtue of his interests in the “Russian extractives and energy sectors, sectors of strategic significance to the government of Russia”. The 54-year-old has previously come under scrutiny for his UK political links, too. In 2008, he became embroiled in a bitter row that exposed his ties to two of the most powerful figures in modern British politics: Lord Mandelson and George Osborne. It all began when it emerged that Peter Mandelson, then trade secretary, had cut import duties affecting Deripaska’s aluminium empire, Rusal, after being entertained aboard the oligarch’s “superyacht”, the 73m Queen K, off Corfu. The plot thickened when the financier Nat Rothschild wrote to the Times to say that George Osborne, the Tory shadow chancellor and a fellow alumnus of Oxford’s Bullingdon drinking club, had also met the Russian in Corfu, at the Rothschild family villa. Osborne, he said, “found the opportunity of meeting with Mr Deripaska so good” that he invited the Conservatives’ fundraiser Andrew Feldman to visit Deripaska on his yacht. Rothschild claimed that the idea was floated that Deripaska could donate to the Tories via one of his British companies, avoiding a ban on the foreign funding of political parties. Deripaska was not present during the conversation and Osborne later said that the mention of donations was not a suggestion but a standard explanation of the rules. The Russian’s addition to the sanctions list means he is now bound by a different set of rules entirely, including a freeze on his UK assets and a travel ban that covers private jets and yachts. Yachts were not part of the 54-year-old’s early life. He hails from Krasnodar in southern Russia, where he was raised by grandparents after his widowed mother had to move away to find a job. After graduating from Moscow State university with a degree in physics in 1993, he became a metals trader. Like many oligarchs, Deripaska owes much of his wealth to the tumultuous fall of the Soviet Union. He gained control of vast previously state-owned aluminium assets, which he later consolidated within the Rusal group, in partnership with Roman Abramovich, a fellow sanctions target. Rusal, now part of Deripaska’s En+ Group, raised $1.5bn with a listing on the London Stock Exchange in 2017. But in 2018 the US included the company and Deripaska himself on a list of sanctioned entities and oligarchs, in reponse to “worldwide malign activity” by Russia. That same year, the Belarusian model and escort Anastasia Vashukevich claimed to possess evidence of Deripaska’s involvement in attempts to interfere in US elections, after spending time on another of his yachts, the Elden. She was arrested upon her arrival in Moscow after deportation from Thailand. US sanctions on En+, although not on Deripaska himself, were eventually lifted with the help of the Tory peer Greg Barker, who earned a bonus said to be worth more than £3m for his role in negotiating with the US Treasury. Deripaska agreed to leave the board of En+ and reduce his ownership interest to less than 50% under the agreement. Barker was chair of En+ until he stepped down earlier this week. Deripaska’s British business interests were helped by learning English at the London School of Economics in the 00s. His wife from 2001 to 2018, Polina Yumasheva – the daughter of a senior adviser to the former Russian president Boris Yeltsin – already spoke English well, having been sent to the Somerset public school Millfield as a teenager. While Deripaska has strong ties to the UK, one person familiar with En+ and Deripaska said his view of the west had been “jaundiced” by its apparent rejection of him and that he had become “increasingly anti-American”. “He’s fun, intelligent, articulate, he’s got a sense of humour,” they said. “He likes yoga and he’s extremely fit, a very intelligent guy who studied physics at university. But he’s torn between loving the west and on the other hand underneath it all he’s very much a Russian ideologue.” “I don’t think he’s a particular fan of Putin, but he’s a Russian patriot through and through.” Deripaska’s yachts have now been at the centre of two major political scandals, in the UK and the US. One, the Clio, was sailing up the Suez Canal as of Thursday afternoon. It had previously been identified among five other superyachts moored or sailing near the Maldives, all owned by Russian billionaires.",News/World news,Oleg Deripaska: Putin ‘favourite’ with strong ties to Britain,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/oleg-deripaska-profile-putin-britain
3/11/2022,"Russia has drawn up plans to seize the assets of western companies leaving the country as the Kremlin pushes back against sweeping sanctions and the exodus of international businesses since its invasion of Ukraine. Announcing the move after a string of global firms said they would suspend operations in Russia this week, including McDonald’s, Coca-Cola and Pepsi, the country’s economic ministry said it could take temporary control of departing businesses where foreign ownership exceeds 25%. Speaking in a video link with members of his government on Thursday, Vladimir Putin said the Kremlin could find legally viable ways to seize international firms. The government would push to “introduce external management and then transfer these enterprises to those who actually want to work,” Putin said. “There are enough legal and market instruments for this.” Mikhail Mishustin, the Russian prime minister, said that while most businesses had temporarily suspended operations, the situation would be closely monitored and that steps to “introduce an external administration” could be used. The move comes as western governments seek to impose maximum pressure on Putin after the invasion of Ukraine by announcing drastic restrictions on imports of Russian oil and gas on top of financial sanctions and asset freezes for prominent oligarchs. On top of formal sanctions, major western businesses and high-profile brands have taken steps to either exit the country altogether or suspend operations in response to the invasion, including Starbucks and McDonald’s. Shell has announced plans to withdraw from Russian oil and gas, BP has said it will exit stakes in major projects, while Unilever has said it will stop imports and exports to the country. Burger King announced on Thursday that it would suspend all its corporate support for the Russian market, including operations, marketing and supply chain. The company does not directly operate restaurants in the country, the brand being run instead by local franchise partners. Outlining the Kremlin’s response to its increasing international isolation, Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president, said it was using a “symmetrical response” to the sanctions imposed by the west, “including the seizure of foreign assets and their possible nationalisation”. “The same applies to the refusal of foreign companies to work in our country,” he wrote in a post on the social media website VKontakte, accusing western firms leaving the country of being “moronic for dancing to the tune of Washington and Brussels”. He said Moscow would respond “fundamentally and harshly” to the departures, adding: “Whatever the reasons for the exodus, foreign companies must understand that it will not be easy to return to our market.” Russia announced plans on Thursday designed to exert pressure back on the west through economic sanctions, including through an export ban on timber, electronic and telecoms equipment. Moscow also passed laws to impound $10bn (£7.6bn) of jets leased to Aeroflot and other Russian airlines by western organisations. It comes as Russia heads closer to defaulting on government debt payments, with ratings agencies warning of “imminent” failure in a move that could lead to financial losses for holders of Russian sovereign bonds. The World Bank’s chief economist, Carmen Reinhart, said on Thursday that both Russia and Belarus were “square in default territory” in an interview with Reuters. Fitch downgraded Russia’s sovereign rating further into “junk” status earlier this week, warning that the government was increasingly likely to renege on its payment commitments. Russia is due to make payments worth about $117m on government borrowing denominated in US dollars on Wednesday next week. However, doubts have been raised over whether the coupon payments will be made amid western sanctions on the Russian central bank and commercial lenders, as well as retaliatory steps announced by Moscow. Reinhart said the impact for the global financial system had been limited so far, although she warned that risks could emerge in Europe. Around half of Russia’s international bonds are held by foreign investors. Foreign banks have exposure of more than $121bn in Russia, much of that concentrated among European lenders, according to data from the Bank of International Settlements. “I worry about what I do not see,” Reinhart said. “Financial institutions are well capitalised, but balance sheets are often opaque … There is the issue of Russian private-sector defaults. One cannot be complacent.”",News/World news,Russia plans to seize assets of western companies exiting country,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/russia-plans-to-seize-assets-of-western-companies-exiting-country
