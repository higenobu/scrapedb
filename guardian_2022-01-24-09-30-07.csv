1/24/2022,"Farewell tours often have one eye on the past and the other on the cash register – but if Midnight Oil’s show in Launceston on Sunday was any indication, they’re not coasting to the finish line. The first of four performances for Tasmania’s Mona Foma festival – the band will play in Launceston once more, then on to Hobart – marks the start of a tour billed as the Oils’ last ever live shows.  But it’s not the end: Midnight Oil are about to drop a new album, due 18 February, and may continue writing and recording. “We’ve played intensely physical gigs since our humble beginnings back in 1977, and we never want to take even the slightest risk of compromising that,” guitarist Jim Moginie wrote in a statement. With the death of longtime bassist Bones Hillman in November 2020, he explained, they felt at the “end of a cycle”. The grassy waterside flat where the Esk and Tamar rivers meet makes for a nice, low-key way to start the band’s lap of stadiums and arenas, gently evoking the Sydney Harbour setting of their seminal 1985 concert film Oils on the Water. The band might move a bit more gingerly than in 1985, but tracks like 1982’s Only The Strong still hit like a slap in the face. Moginie’s and Martin Rotsey’s guitars bring a pub rock fury that hasn’t been dulled by time or a pandemic, as the pair stand stoically on each side of the stage bookending the eternally flailing frontman Peter Garrett. Up the back, Rob Hirst pounds the drums with unyielding joy – no one, it seems, has more fun at a Midnight Oil show than him. When Hirst, bassist Adam Ventoura and guest backing singers Leah Flanagan and Liz Stringer add a stack of harmonies to Read About It, Short Memory and US Forces, it’s hard not to be swept up. Midnight Oil have been coming to Tasmania for a long time and have the songs to show for it, from 1981’s chugging environmental anthem Burnie (“It’s a little cleaner now than it was when we were there, when this song was written,” Garret says of the city north of Launceston) to 1993’s Truganini. Garrett says Burnie and Truganini are meant to “commemorate and inspire”, but on newer tracks from the forthcoming album, Resist, his tone is more urgent. A winding acoustic riff opens Tarkine, a tribute to the embattled forest in Tasmania’s north-east and the album’s second single. Its chorus is up there with some of the band’s best belters, but it’s also an opportunity for Garrett to vent – and all the time stuck at home over the past 18 months not mellowed him. “I am so pissed off and angry, I can’t tell you,” he says, pouring disappointed scorn on “parasites, layabouts and magic tongue merchants” who dominate the airwaves and the “highest office in the land”. He then offers a word of caution to his fellow baby boomers, despairing at how, with cruel irony, Australia feels like a less egalitarian nation than when the band started. “This stuff can sneak up on you,” he laments. “Next thing you know, the best parts of it are gone – and the best parts are not nostalgia.” The reunion and farewell tour industry is usually geared towards indulging older, well-off fans, so to hear Garrett remonstrating such generational failure is arresting. It adds a new edge to an anthem like Forgotten Years, but also drives home what they’re hanging up: sung live, there’s a mournful rage to the album’s climate change-inspired single Rising Seas that’s unmatched on the record. Garrett sings with the grief and frustration of a former Gillard government minister who has had to watch a legacy of climate action gleefully unpicked by their successors: Every child, put down your toysAnd come inside to sleepWe have to look you in the eyeAnd say, “We sold you cheap” After two hours, the band have mined most corners of their back catalogue, from the skittish 90s beats of Redneck Wonderland to tracks from last year’s The Marrakata Project. But while Beds Are Burning squeaks in during the encore, a few other key tracks are left unplayed when the hard curfew sets in. There is one big casualty: like Chekhov’s gun, the well-beaten corrugated iron water tank that sits behind Hirst’s kit suggests we’ll be treated to Power and the Passion (and its extended drum solo). But not tonight, and there’s something admirable in the band declining to cut any of the weighty new material, deep cuts or mid-set sermons to cram in more fan favourites. All the same, it’s an awful lot of metal to lug around for naught. Instead, they close with a defiant refrain from 1987’s Diesel and Dust: “Sometimes you’re shaken to the core / Sometimes the face is gonna fall / But you don’t give in”. The band members leave the stage – and don’t look back.  Midnight Oil play Launceston on 25 January and Hobart on 28 and 31 January, as part of Mona Foma festival. Their final tour runs until May, taking in city centres and regions around Australia and New Zealand ",Arts/Music,"‘So pissed off’: Midnight Oil kick off final tour with a searing, urgent set in Launceston",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/24/so-pissed-off-midnight-oil-kick-off-final-tour-with-a-searing-urgent-set-in-launceston
1/24/2022,"NHS trusts in England lost nearly 2m days in staff absences due to long Covid in the first 18 months of the pandemic, according to figures that reveal the hidden burden of ongoing illness in the health service. MPs on the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on coronavirus estimate that more than 1.82m days were lost to healthcare workers with long Covid from March 2020 to September 2021 across England’s 219 NHS trusts.  The estimate is based on data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act from 70 NHS trusts and does not include the impact of the highly transmissible Omicron variant that has fulled record-breaking waves of infection in the UK and globally since it was first detected in November. Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP who chairs the APPG, said the government had paid “almost no attention to long Covid and the severe impact it was having on vital public services” and called for immediate support for those affected. “Thousands of frontline workers are now living with an often debilitating condition after being exposed to the virus while protecting this country,” she said. “They cannot now be abandoned.” The Office for National Statistics estimates that 1.3 million people, or 2% of the population, are living with long Covid, based on people self-reporting symptoms that last more than a month after a Covid infection. More than half a million have had symptoms for at least a year, with ailments ranging from breathlessness, fatigue and a cough to muscle aches and pains, “brain fog”, headaches and palpitations. While the figures are only a rough estimate of the impact long Covid is having on health service staff, the MPs have called on the government to recognise the condition as an occupational disease. The move would help standardise support and care for those affected, and improve data collection on the problem across the country. In a further step, the MPs urged ministers to set up a compensation scheme for key workers who have suffered financially through loss of work. The APPG estimates that long Covid caused thousands of staff to be off work for four weeks or more in any given period of the epidemic up until September 2021. The average trust had more than 100 staff off with long Covid and lost more than 8,000 days in absences over the period examined. Only four NHS trusts provided details on the duration of staff absences due to long Covid. These suggest that on average staff were off for more than 80 days with long-term symptoms. Moran said the government must create a compensation scheme for “any of these key workers who have been unable to return to work” and “as a first step in protecting our public services from the impact of long Covid, they must recognise it as an occupational disease and provide formal guidance to employers.” Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, said while additional funding had been set aside for long Covid services, demand was likely to grow given the large number of people infected in the Omicron wave. “We will need to see more long-term, structural support for treatment of long Covid, as the shorter term horizon of fixed pots of funding make it difficult to develop and train a sustainable workforce,” she said. “This is particularly important for community trusts and primary care services which have been on the frontline of managing long Covid support. “As we start to grapple with the long term effects of Covid, the government will need to look at the wider socio-economic impacts of the disease, including who needs specific support. While this is a decision for government, we know that worklessness and economic deprivation increase demand for mental health services, which are already under incredible strain.”",News/Society,Long Covid: nearly 2m days lost in NHS staff absences in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/24/long-covid-nearly-2m-days-lost-in-nhs-staff-absences-in-england
1/24/2022,"The sharing of some of the most insidious images of child abuse will not be prevented by a new government bill that aims to the make the internet a safer place, MPs have said. The draft online safety bill is not clear or robust enough to tackle some forms of illegal and harmful content, according to a report by the digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) committee. The landmark bill places a duty of care on tech firms to protect users from harmful content or face substantial fines imposed by the communications regulator Ofcom.  “In its current form what should be world-leading, landmark legislation instead represents a missed opportunity,” said Julian Knight, the chair of the DCMS committee. “The online safety bill neither protects freedom of expression, nor is it clear nor robust enough to tackle illegal and harmful online content. Urgency is required to ensure that some of the most pernicious forms of child sexual abuse do not evade detection because of a failure in the online safety law.” The report urges the government to tackle types of content that are technically legal such as “breadcrumbing”, where child abusers leave digital signposts for fellow abusers to find abuse content, and deepfake pornography, which it says are not covered by the bill currently, although creators of deepfake images can be prosecuted for harassment. On child sexual abuse, the committee said the bill should tackle behaviour by predators designed to evade content moderation. “One starting point should be to reframe the definition of illegal content to explicitly add the need to consider context as a factor, and include explicitly definitions of activity like breadcrumbing on the face of the bill,” says the report. As currently drafted, the bill’s duty of care is split into three parts: preventing the proliferation of illegal content and activity such as child pornography, terrorist material and hate crimes; ensuring children are not exposed to harmful or inappropriate content; and, for large tech platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, ensuring that adults are protected from legal but harmful content, a catch-all term covering issues such as cyberbullying. The report recommends that the bill gives a definition of legal but harmful content that includes undermining someone’s reputation, national security or public health. The category should also account for attempts to interfere in elections or deter the public from voting, it says. Legal but harmful content is not strictly defined in the draft bill but it gives the culture secretary a key role in defining it. Reflecting concerns that the legal but harmful category will affect freedom of speech, the report recommends a “must balance” test that weighs whether freedom of speech has been protected sufficiently in decisions on content. The report warns that the bill is “vague” about the definition of illegal content and should be redrafted to state that it applies to existing criminal offences, rather than regulatory or civil offences. It also calls for Ofcom to have the power to conduct audits of tech companies’ systems. The former information commissioner Elizabeth Denham told MPs and peers last year that Ofcom should have the power to “look under the bonnet” of tech firms and scrutinise algorithms that could steer users down dangerous content rabbit holes. It is the second committee report to demand changes to the bill, after a joint committee of MPs and peers urged a wide range of amendments, including criminal sanctions for tech executives who fail to deal with “repeated and systemic” safety failings. However, the DCMS committee report pushes back on calls for a permanent committee to oversee the act, stating that such a move would be a “significant departure from convention” and oversight of the act should be carried out by existing cross-party select committees. The government has already suggested “significant improvements” could be made to the draft bill, with the culture minister Chris Philp telling MPs during a debate in the Commons this month that there were a number of areas where the online safety bill could be “improved substantially”. A DCMS spokesperson rejected the committee’s criticism of the bill, saying it set a “gold standard” for safety. They said: “We do not agree with the criticism of the committee. The bill has been recognised as setting a global gold standard for internet safety. It has strict measures including a duty of care to stamp out child sexual abuse, grooming and illegal and harmful content.” The spokesperson added: “The bill will make the UK the safest place to go online while protecting freedom of speech.”",News/Technology,"Online safety bill ‘a missed opportunity’ to prevent child abuse, MPs warn",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/24/online-safety-bill-missed-opportunity-to-detect-child-abuse
1/24/2022,"Britain’s biggest cities have lost almost a year’s worth of sales during the coronavirus pandemic as lockdowns and a lack of office workers and tourists caused a collapse in consumer spending. As offices have started to reopen following the relaxation of plan B restrictions, the Centre for Cities said Covid-19 had “levelled down” historically more prosperous high street destinations.  London recorded the biggest drop for in-person spending for retail and hospitality, losing as much as 47 weeks’ worth of sales between March 2020 and November 2021 compared with the average value for weekly transactions in 2019 before the crisis hit. According to spending data compiled from anonymous card transactions, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Cardiff also lost nearly a year’s worth of sales as people stayed away from big city centres during the health emergency. In comparison, towns and smaller cities have recorded a smaller drop in retail and hospitality, according to the thinktank’s annual Cities Outlook report for 2022. Burnley had the smallest drop in spending with the loss of just eight weeks of sales. Warrington, Huddersfield and Blackpool also lost relatively few sales compared with 2019. The study of 52 city and town centres showed a sharp increase in the number of commercial units falling vacant during the crisis, rising to 2,426 compared with an increase of 1,374 between 2018 and 2020. However, it showed that high streets in economically weaker places have been less affected by the pandemic, with a smaller increase in vacancy rates than in bigger city centre locations. Andrew Carter, chief executive of the Centre for Cities, said the pandemic had had the effect of pausing the long-term decline of poorer parts of the country in the north and Midlands, helped by emergency economic support from the government. However, he warned that while stronger cities had borne the economic brunt of the pandemic, their higher levels of affluence meant the end of restrictions should mean the return of office workers and a swift recovery. “To help them avoid a wave of high street closures this year, the government must set out how it plans to increase people’s skills and pay to give them the income needed to sustain a thriving high street,” he said. Retail consultancy Springboard said home working had led to the growth of “localism”, with consumers visiting nearby high streets when previously they would have shopped in city centres. The most extreme example was in London: in 2021 footfall in outer London was 27% lower than in 2019, while in central London the drop was 52%. The organisation said in 2022 it expected hybrid working to lead to more and longer visits to retail destinations in the evenings and at weekends, as well as an increase in people combining shopping and dining.",News/Business,UK’s biggest cities lose nearly a year of sales to Covid-related downturn,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/24/uk-biggest-cities-lose-year-sales-to-covid
1/24/2022,"Part of Southwark Playhouse’s Shakespeare for Schools project, this drastically pared-down version of Romeo & Juliet will be shown to 2,000 local young people for free. They certainly won’t be bored: the production is peppered with cheeky ad-libs (“Call a fucking ambulance!”) and whizzes along at just 100 minutes. It has been created in the spirit of good fun, which is lovely in theory but ultimately undercuts the tragedy. When Shakespeare’s star-crossed lovers finally take their own lives, it’s a shock – and not for quite the right reasons. There are lots of good intentions here, but not nearly enough rigour. The framing device is just that – a framework, and little else. Nicky Allpress has relocated Shakespeare’s timeless tragedy to Brixton in the 1980s, and it turns out it isn’t all that timeless after all. There are some projections of riots at the beginning and end and 80s costumes and music are used throughout. Other than that, the loose framing device creates more questions than it answers. Why are two teenagers getting married after knowing each other for just one day? How on earth are they this innocent and why doesn’t someone just pick up a phone?  The frequent ad-libs work pretty well when they’re thrown in separately from the text – but when phrases like “South Laandon” are jammed into the original verse, things get messy. There’s no rhythm and very little sense and some fairly frantic doubling work only makes things more confusing. Joey Ellis has a strong physical presence but he’s landed with playing the Prince, Mercutio and Paris – often in quick succession. Recent graduate Samuel Tracy plays Romeo as a dazzled innocent, jumping into the air with glee when Juliet (Laura Lake Adebisi) suggests marriage. There’s a lovely fizzing hopefulness about their scenes together but it’s the scenes between Juliet and her nurse (Amy Loughton) that have intensity and clarity. Loughton is a talented comic and bustles about the stage, handing out piles of washing to the audience – but she never once loses control of Shakespeare’s verse. When the nurse discovers Juliet’s cold body, it’s a strangely welcome moment of pathos in this lively but patchy production. Romeo & Juliet is at Southwark Playhouse, London, until 5 February.",Arts/Stage,Romeo & Juliet review – speedy 2-Tone adaptation lacks nuance,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/24/romeo-juliet-review-speedy-2-tone-adaptation-lacks-nuance
1/24/2022,"Just after the halfway point of their innings England, poised at a reasonable if not outstanding 64 for two, thrashed 24 runs off an over bowled by the spinner Fabian Allen. Even at the time it felt potentially decisive, but around an hour and a half later West Indies stood at a similar point in their reply, already nine runs and two wickets worse off, and needing a similar acceleration as England tossed the ball to a spinner of their own. Adil Rashid bowled a wicket maiden, Moeen Ali promptly took a couple more, and England were on their way to avenging their humiliating defeat in Saturday’s opener. The contest was to be closer than anyone would at that point have predicted. Just as England’s victory appeared a formality Romario Shepherd and Akeal Hosein set about wrestling West Indies back into contention, bludgeoning nine sixes between them as the home side eventually fell short by a single run having ended their innings in such style that it is perhaps they, despite the defeat, who will go into the third game with greater momentum.  A high-scoring and in the end thrillingly close encounter could hardly have been more different to the first match of the series, surprisingly because at the start it looked almost the same: again West Indies won the toss and put England in while Eoin Morgan resisted the urge to make wholesale changes to a losing team – the substitution of Reece Topley for Tymal Mills was the only change to either side – and sagely noted before the start that “the challenge, similar to yesterday, is going to be adapting to conditions – but better”. The most significant difference from Saturday’s opener was the pitch, just a few metres away but without the flecks of green that perhaps contributed to the tourists’ batting woes. More important still was its location, which left one boundary significantly closer than the other. This increasingly came to dominate West Indies’ thinking as they bowled, leading at one point to Chris Jordan – who made another fine cameo with the bat but whose death bowling was later to be brutally punished – facing Romario Shepherd with his heels on the line of off stump, leaving most of the wicket unguarded as the ball was angled across him. Though England did not exactly explode out of the blocks, with Saturday’s scars still fresh a little circumspection seemed appropriate. West Indies’ own reading of the conditions quickly became clear: there were three overs of spin in the powerplay, during which Jason Holder produced a couple of slow balls that were no faster than some of what Allen and Hosein were producing, one of which completely bewildered Jason Roy. Allen eventually made a double breakthrough in the final over of the powerplay, dismissing both Tom Banton and James Vince. At the other end Jason Roy watched and learned, and it was he who was single-handedly responsible for massacring Allen’s final over shortly after drinks. At the halfway stage of England’s innings Roy had 17 off 23; six deliveries later he was on the verge of a half-century, a mark he failed to meet after slapping Shepherd’s second delivery of the night straight to long-on. West Indies will regret the quality of their fielding, which was at times completely hapless. Most notably Moeen was twice the beneficiary of ghastly drops, though Darren Bravo had the decent excuse of the setting sun glaring straight at him as he stood still and let the ball drop safely nearby. England’s 171 for eight appeared a more than decent total, all the more so when the first three overs of West Indies’ reply went for three, two and one while Reece Topley was responsible for taking two wickets, trapping Brandon King, whose half-century made him the outstanding batter of the opening encounter, with the second ball of the innings and brilliantly running out Shai Hope in his next over. When Bravo, Kieron Pollard and then Odean Smith fell shortly after the halfway stage of the West Indies, leaving them 65 for seven, another comprehensive defeat appeared likely. But that was before Shepherd made his dramatic intervention. Suddenly it was raining sixes, Shepherd hammering Dawson over midwicket and then, three balls later, sending the ball looping over the Garfield Sobers Pavilion. Fabian Allen’s dismissal in the 16th over, pulling to Tom Banton at deep backward square leg, seemed likely to drain the batting side’s momentum, but instead Hosein increased it. In 14 previous T20 internationals his highest score had been six; here he hit a ludicrous 16-ball 44. At the start of Saqib Mahmood’s final over West Indies needed a hilariously improbable 30 runs, but two wides, two fours and three sixes later it was England’s bowling that appeared comic, and the home side had been brilliantly, thrillingly, and very nervously beaten.",Sport/Sport,Jason Roy gives England platform to survive West Indies’ late surge,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/24/jason-roy-gives-england-platform-to-survive-west-indies-late-surge

But pursuing something greater than pleasure involves putting ourselves in the way of pain, difficulty and denial.

Notable quote: When asked about Sky After Dark presenter Chris Kenny’s comment that she is “another green left activist”, Karvelas bristled with irritation. “In the years I worked with him at the Australian newspaper I don’t recall him telling me I was a green left activist.” Investigative journalist Sam Quinones has spent years writing about opioids in the US and Mexico. As synthetic drugs like fentanyl and meth increase in usage, he says: “The opioid epidemic is probably a misnomer by now. It’s actually an epidemic of addiction.” Notable quote: When asked how fentanyl, which is now responsible for 70% of overdoses in the US, is making it into other drugs, Quinones says: “It’s a market expansion tool. When you put fentanyl into cocaine, in fairly short order that user will become a fentanyl addict … Whereas a cocaine user would buy from you every few days or every weekend, this customer has to buy from you every single day. But, of course, you run the risk of killing some of your customers by doing that.” How long will it take me to read? About four minutes.
