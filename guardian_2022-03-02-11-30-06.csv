3/2/2022,"The things that will stay with me about the weather event and subsequent flooding that engulfed Brisbane and south-east Queensland over the weekend was how rapidly it unfolded, its capricious unpredictability and extreme violence. This was not a repeat of the 2011 disaster, which I also lived through, and the captains of hindsight suggesting this – in a simplistic and premature attempt to assign blame – are making a false equivalence. I live on the second floor of a low-lying, poorly drained apartment block in the university suburb of St Lucia, 150 metres as the crow flies from the Brisbane River. In 2011, there was time for the city to prepare. The floods then felt like a train wreck in slow motion. This event began slowly, and for a couple of days in Brisbane early last week the predicted heavy rain did not eventuate. Instead, a trough sat just south of Fraser Island, dumping huge amounts of rain on Gympie and the Sunshine Coast hinterland. But as the week progressed, the developing low-pressure system – to coin a phrase from Clive James’ Unreliable Memoirs – gathered momentum like a piano falling out of a window. There was no comprehending the sound and fury that was about to pulverise us. On Thursday evening, the pall settled over Brisbane, with 64mm falling on the city overnight to 9am. From there, it was as though the atmosphere was trying to outbid the Bureau of Meteorology’s wildest predictions, as a further 225mm hammered down on the Friday. And yet, even as a whopping 228mm more fell through Saturday, only minor flooding was predicted for the Lower Brisbane River. My suburb was not listed as a concern. Talking and listening to others, a theme emerges: no one was prepared for Sunday morning. I wasn’t home that Saturday night as the rain continued to pour. Returning the next day via an increasingly circuitous route – dodging roads that were only just being cut, as the river expanded across the old floodplain of the Jagera people – I had a familiar feeling. Turning down one last hill, I saw the river where it shouldn’t be. Slowly sinking beneath it was my apartment block. Even knowing my unit was above the waterline couldn’t stop the flashbacks to January 2011 as it dawned that I wouldn’t be going home for a while. At that stage, the water was thigh deep and rising with the tide. Emergency services were yet to arrive. With the help of a neighbour and against sound advice, I waded some 100 metres through the dirty water to retrieve my cat and a change of clothes. Getting Priscilla out 😥😿 pic.twitter.com/Oy3LfZKAyq As I retreated, carrying my beloved feline, I knew what it was too late to save: archives in storage downstairs, representing nearly 30 years of work, life and love: everything from juvenilia to draft manuscripts and, most distressing, a box full of my mother’s personal effects. But in a crisis, there is nothing to do but try to control the things that remain within our grasp; such existential trifles pale next to loss of lives and livelihoods. I was lucky to get out early; on Tuesday, the State Emergency Service was still evacuating stranded students and families from their apartments. Still, the rain fell. It was supposed to ease marginally on Sunday. Instead, conditions worsened. The BoM kept revising their forecasts upwards: from 50-100mm, to 150mm, then 200, then up to 300. In the end, 222mm fell: 739mm in four days; nearly 75% of the annual average. And therein lies the nub of this catastrophe: how is anyone supposed to plan for that much rainfall in such a short time? Mount Glorious, to Brisbane’s north-west, had 1,637mm in the same period, which surely should have washed it into Moreton Bay. Some have expressed concerns about controlled releases from the Wivenhoe Dam. When releases began on 11 January 2011, the dam was at 191% capacity and further flows could have risked its structural integrity. Last Thursday, it was at just 58%. Releases began on Friday night in response to heavy inflows. But without releases, the dam couldn’t keep pace with the deluge: by Monday, it was at 185%. It should also be borne in mind that much of the rain fell well south of the dam catchment, directly into the Bremer and Lower Brisbane Rivers and their tributaries. Perhaps the truest parallel to be made between the 2011 and 2022 events is this: both came in La Niña years following periods of prolonged drought. By the Black Summer of 2019–2020, many towns in south-east Queensland had run out of water entirely. On the news, journalists and bewildered interviewees alike spoke of one-in-100-year events. But our subtropical river city went through this just a decade ago. Meteorological records are being smashed so often and by such wide margins they seem to lose all meaning. This is simply what living in a climate emergency looks like. If anyone wants to cast blame, they should direct it at the politicians, their donors and media enablers who sought to distract, deflect and delay action. The overdue bills are piling up.",Opinion/Opinion,There is no comprehending the sound and fury of the flooding that pulverised Brisbane | Andrew Stafford,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/there-is-no-comprehending-the-sound-and-fury-of-the-flooding-that-pulverised-brisbane
3/2/2022,"Texas voters headed to the polls on Tuesday in the first primary contest of the US 2022 midterm elections. Polls closed at 7 pm local time in most of the state. There was relatively low turnout in the contest so far, and voting proceeded on Tuesday with a few hiccups. In Harris county, home of Houston, some voting machines went down Tuesday morning because of glitches. In Tarrant county, home to Fort Worth, more than a dozen polling locations were closed because one of the parties did not have enough election judges present. The state attorney general, Ken Paxton, a staunch Donald Trump ally who has the former president’s endorsement, is seeking the Republican nomination for a third term in office. Paxton, who has been under indictment since 2015 and faces whistleblower accusations of misusing his office, is running against a number of GOP challengers, including George P Bush, the son of Jeb Bush and nephew of George W Bush. Texas governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, notably did not say on Tuesday whether he voted for Paxton. Bush and Paxton’s other challengers are hoping to push him to a runoff election in May. Races go to a runoff in Texas if no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote. Trump has endorsed in 29 races, including Paxton’s. Almost of all of the Republicans he endorsed were expected to win their races, according to the New York Times. Abbott, one of the most conservative Republicans in the country, his party’s nomination for a third term. Democrats are likely to nominate Beto O’Rourke, who narrowly lost a 2018 US Senate bid before his failed presidential campaign in 2020. On the Democratic side, the most closely watched race is between Henry Cuellar, a longtime conservative Democrat in south Texas, and his progressive challenger, Jessica Cisneros, who is backed by Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez. The race is a rematch of 2020, when Cuellar, whose home and office were raided by FBI investigators in January, narrowly defeated Cisneros. When Republicans redrew the district as part of the redistricting process last year, they excised some of the portions where Cisneros performed the most strongly in 2020. The races are being watched as an early signal of the political temperature in the US. Texas is one of the fastest-growing states in the country and 95% of the growth over the last decade has been from people of color. Democrats have not won a statewide election in Texas since 1994, but many see it as increasingly politically competitive. Whichever candidates ultimately prevail in the congressional primaries are highly likely to win in November. When Republicans redrew Texas’s 38 congressional districts last year, they reduced the number of competitive districts from 12 to just one. The single remaining competitive district in the general election is the 15th congressional district, which stretches from outside San Antonio to the border city of McAllen in the southeast. Numerous challenges to the congressional map are pending in court. One of the biggest stories of the primary so far has been the staggering impact of new voting restrictions. The primary is the first in the state in which new sweeping voting restrictions will be in effect. For weeks, election officials have reported widespread problems with implementing the law’s provisions on mail-in ballots. A new requirement that voters note either their state ID or last four digits of their social security number is causing tens of thousands of ballots to be rejected. In El Paso county, at the western end of the Texas-Mexico border, officials have rejected 27% of the 3,855 ballots they received so far, almost all because of problems related to the new state law, according to numbers provided by Lisa Wise, the county elections administrator. In Harris county, the most populous in the state, officials said they had flagged 10,876 ballots – 29% of those returned – for rejection as of Saturday. Leah Shah, a spokesperson for the election office, said the county planned to call voters whose information they had on file to try to get voters to correct any problems with their ballots. The rejection numbers are staggeringly high. In the 2020 election, Texas officials reported rejecting less than 1% of ballots statewide.

3/2/2022,"Clashes erupted between protesters and police at anti-vaccine mandate demonstrations in New Zealand as officers moved to dismantle the movement, while the Māori king and iwi leaders called on those involved to go home and stop abusing the environment, people and sacred sites. The protest, which is in its 23rd day on parliament’s grounds, began as an objection to the government’s temporary vaccine mandates for some parts of the workforce but has since become a vector for a range of disparate complaints including anti-vaccine disinformation, QAnon-style conspiracies, and racist and violent rhetoric. Smaller copy-cat protests have sprouted up across the country, including in Christchurch, Nelson and Auckland. On Wednesday morning, after nearly four weeks of impasse between the protesters and police at parliament, officers in riot gear had gained significant ground, tearing down tents, towing vehicles and making 36 arrests. The police said protesters used fire extinguishers, paint-filled projectiles, homemade plywood shields and pitchforks as weapons and a cord was set up as a trip wire. “In the last week, we have seen a changing mix in the make up of the crowd, in particular we have become concerned that those with good intentions have become outnumbered by those with a willingness to use violence to affect their means,” police commissioner Andrew Coster said. For the first time since the protests began, Māori iwi leaders have come together to publicly denounce the violence exhibited at the occupation site which has included verbal attacks on members of the public; the call for the execution of journalists, politicians and health officials; the release of human waste into the sea and the damage to both public and private property. The spokeperson for the Māori King, Rahui Papa, said while the Kiingitanga movement supports the right to protest, it was time protesters started “heading home and looking after their whānau”. “We do have some sympathy and empathy towards those that have lost their jobs and towards those that are actually feeling the pinch,” Papa said, adding that the Kiingitanga wants all communities to support whānau during these “trying times” to foster unity, as the pandemic evolves. King Tūheitia is a strong advocate of the Covid-19 response, Papa said, and the Kiingitanga movement has not thrown its weight behind the protests, despite some rumours saying otherwise. “Right from the get go, the King put out an unequivocal statement, saying the health and well being of whānau is paramount. We took from the examples of [Princess] Te Puea in the Spanish flu epidemic ….[who said] if vaccines had been prominent in her time, she would have absolutely put out the call for people to be vaccinated.” Wellington’s mana whenua (people of the land), Taranaki Whānui, said the protesters are flagrantly dishonouring tikanga (customs) and the iwi wants a peaceful resolution. “We’ve seen the desecration of our whenua [land], we’ve seen the desecration of our moana [sea], and we’ve seen people come through the back door of our ancestral whare [building], of our marae [sacred site], trying to serve trespass notices on the people who actually manage and work there,” said its chair Kara Puketapu-Dentice. “People have also smashed out windows at our new office and we’ve seen people abuse our elderly people and children who are just going about their daily business in our city.” On Monday morning, a Te Kahu o te Raukura – a cloak or form of cultural protection -was laid in a dawn ceremony at Pipitea Marae, which is a short walk from parliament. The laying of the cloak is to uphold peace, honour and goodwill, which Puketapu-Dentice said has not been displayed in the past few weeks. Puketapu-Dentice understands why so many Māori are at the protest, and attributes this to a long history of grievances against the Crown, and a “deep-seated level of mistrust of government”, but it is time for the protesters to go home, he said. “We’re not going to unify and heal whilst we’re on parliament grounds or blocking the streets of Wellington. The healing needs to happen back at home. The healing needs to happen back in our communities. The healing needs to happen back with our whānau.” In Auckland, Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, said it did not support protest actions against vaccination and mandates and wants the occupation at Auckland’s domain brought to a swift end. “These actions are in direct opposition to the pathway we have chosen as leaders of our people.” Its chair, Marama Royal said: “while we understand very deeply that protest action is sometimes necessary, we do not believe this is the time or place for activity that will only increase the risk of spreading infection and misinformation”.",News/World news,Police move to clear New Zealand protests as Māori king calls for end to occupation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/police-move-to-clear-new-zealand-protests-as-maori-king-calls-for-end-to-occupation
3/2/2022,"Pent-up demand by households freed from Covid lockdowns helped drive Australia’s economy back to growth in the December quarter, although the pace of the rebound fell short of some expectations. Australia’s gross domestic product expanded at a seasonally adjusted 3.4% clip in the December quarter, recovering from a 1.9% contraction in the previous three months when Melbourne and Sydney was under tight Covid restrictions, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. GDP expanded 4.2% compared with the December quarter in 2021, quickening from the 3.4% annual rate in the September quarter. Economists are likely to focus on the relatively weak quarterly pace compared with expectations, and may pare back their forecasts of when the Reserve Bank may move to lift the official case rate. As of yesterday, investors were betting that first move would come in July after the RBA board held its March meeting and warned of fresh uncertainties because of Russia’s attack on Ukraine. The household saving ratio, which measures how much they set aside from income, fell by about one-third during the December quarter to 13.6% from 19.8%, helping to stoke growth.“Domestic demand drove the growth this quarter with high levels of household spending, particularly in the states that emerged from Covid-19 lockdowns,” said Sean Crick, acting head of National Accounts at the ABS. “Household spending in [the locked down jurisdictions of] NSW, Victoria and the ACT rose 9.6% compared to the rest of Australia which rose 1.6.” Household spending recovered from the 4.8% dive in the September and exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the first time, the ABS said. Hotels, cafes and restaurants were prime targets for shoppers, rising almost a quarter during the final three months 0f 2021, while outlays for recreation and culture grew 17.1% and health 7.9%. Even so, limited travel meant overall spending on services remained 3.9% below pre-pandemic levels.Spending on goods, which had held up better amid the Covid restrictions, advanced 6.3% during the quarter and was almost 9% above pre-pandemic outlays. Offsetting households’ splurge was a 1.4% drop in private investment, reflecting ongoing shortages of labour and construction materials, the ABS said. Dwelling investment fell 2.2% in the quarter despite high levels of approvals lately. Government consumption, which had been a ballast for economic activity, made no net contribution to the latest quarter’s growth. Among the banks, Westpac had forecast 3.3% quarterly growth, ANZ 3.6% and the CBA 3.7%. The median forecast was 3.5% The latter has been the most bullish of the big four banks, earlier this year bringing forward to June the timing when its predicts the RBA would lift its cast rate to 0.25%.
