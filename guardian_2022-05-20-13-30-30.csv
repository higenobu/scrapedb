5/20/2022,"As Tucker Carlson asked Hunter Biden for help getting his son into an elite Washington university in 2014, the Fox News host’s wife, Susie, reportedly wrote in an email: “Tucker and I have the greatest respect and admiration for you. Always!” Since the 2020 election, however, Carlson has fueled rightwing attacks on Joe Biden’s son, particularly over business affairs in which he allegedly benefited from his father’s position. The existence of emails about getting Buckley Carlson into Georgetown has been known for some time, thanks to a laptop once owned by Hunter Biden that was obtained by Donald Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and pushed to media in 2020. On Thursday the Washington Post revealed new emails and said analysis by security experts confirmed their authenticity. The emails, the Post said, “reveal the extent to which Carlson was willing to turn on a former associate as he thrives in a hyper-partisan media world in which conservatives have made Biden a prime target for attack.” “They also show how Carlson once sought to benefit from the elite political circles in Washington that he now regularly rails against as the ‘ruling class’.” Carlson told the Post that in 2014, when Joe Biden was vice-president, “Hunter Biden was my neighbor. Our wives were friends. I knew him well. “I talked to him many times about addiction, something I know a lot about. And I’ve said that. I think that Hunter Biden is an addict and that’s why his life is falling apart, and I feel bad for him. I’ve said that many times, and I mean it.” He also said he would not comment on the emails, as they “were described by our [intelligence] community as Russian disinformation. So why would I? And I read that in the Washington Post”. The Post said Carlson was “speaking with apparent irony”. He and others on the right charge that mainstream media willfully overlooked the Biden laptop in 2020, amid reports it could contain disinformation planted by Russia or other malign actors. The Post also said emails showed Carlson helping Biden in 2015, amid reports about the state of Biden’s marriage. Carlson has confirmed doing so. But the Post focused on Carlson’s apparent hypocrisy. Quoting Carlson accusing Hunter Biden of getting “lucrative jobs … because he had an important father”, the Post said the Fox News host did so without “disclosing that he had once enlisted Biden to help get his son into a prestigious private university”. On the same January 2020 show, Carlson said: “In America today, there’s nothing illegal about paying de facto bribes by handing fake jobs to the unqualified family members of powerful people. And since it is perfectly legal, naturally, Hunter Biden isn’t the only one shamelessly cashing in on his family name.” In another email reported by the Post, Susie Carlson wrote: “Tucker and I would be so grateful if you could write a letter or speak to someone in the Georgetown Admission’s [sic] Office about Buckley.” Biden reportedly agreed to write to the university president and said: “I will do anything you would like me to do.” According to the Post, Tucker Carlson wrote: “I can’t thank you enough for writing that letter to Georgetown on Bucky’s behalf. So nice of you. I know it’ll help. Hope you’re great and we can all get dinner soon.” Buckley Carlson went to the University of Virginia. Now communications director for Jim Banks, a House Republican from Indiana, he did not comment on the Post report.Amid reaction online, the author Radley Balko wrote: “The story here is that Tucker Carlson is the living embodiment of the unearned, privileged elitism that Tucker Carlson derides on his show every night. The Hunter Biden part is just gravy.” Rightwing accounts pointed to an NBC report which said Biden’s laptop and other sources showed that between 2013 and 2018, he and his company brought in about $11m from work linked to Ukraine and China.

5/20/2022,"One of Joe Biden’s closest allies is due to arrive in London on Saturday as part of an influential US congressional delegation seeking to calm tensions over Northern Ireland. The nine-strong delegation includes Democratic and Republican delegates from the House of Representatives and Senate including members of the powerful ways and means committee chaired by Richard Neal, who will lead the group. The group was due to land in Brussels early Friday for a series of meetings, including with the European Commission’s vice-president and Brexit commissioner Maroš Šefčovič, to kick off a six-day trip that will also take in Dublin, Kerry and Belfast. They will travel to London for Saturday meetings with the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevalyan, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, and Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow international trade secretary. Neal has also requested a meeting with Boris Johnson and while nothing is scheduled he said he was “hopeful” talks with the prime minister could still be arranged. The delegation’s arrival is being seen as a significant intervention by the US, which is acting as co-guarantor of the 1998 Good Friday agreement. Neal has already made his displeasure known over the government’s plan to draft legislation to remove parts of the Northern Ireland protocol from the Brexit treaty despite warnings it could risk a full trade war with the EU. But he told the Guardian his mission was to defuse tensions and help broker a UK-EU deal. “My purpose is manifold but we really want to reaffirm America’s unwavering commitment to the Good Friday agreement and to remind everybody that on the eve of the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, it has worked splendidly,” he said. “I want to remind everybody in the UK, in Northern Ireland that it should not be treated as a cavalier achievement.” He said it was important to pull back from the brink of unilateral action to breach the Brexit treaty. “They haven’t breached it yet. They’re talking about breaching it, so part of my job is to convince them not to breach it,” he said. He confirmed that Biden has a “high level of interest” in appointing a special envoy to Northern Ireland echoing the move to send Senator George Mitchell, one of the architects of the peace accord, to Belfast in 1995. Shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Kyle, said the US visit should be a welcome interjection given the Democratic Unionist party threats not to return to power-sharing until the new laws on the protocol were enacted. “The UK government is unable to provide the stability or platform for which political differences can be settled, so therefore it falls to another country.” He added: “It is humiliating for our government and our country. We need a third-party country to come in and seek a resolution and to be an honest broker.” Alongside Neal on the trip are Republicans Kevin Brady, Mike Kelly, Vern Buchanan and David Joyce and Democrats Ron Kind, Dan Kildee and Mary Gay Scanlon. After London, the delegation will travel to Dublin to meet the Irish leaders and Belfast to meet Sinn Féin leaders and the DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, whom Neal has met on many occasions. The delegation will also visit Ventry in Kerry, the birthplace of Neal’s maternal family, the Garveys, to meet with an agriculture delegation travelling to the Eastern States Exposition in September. The EU ambassador to the UK rejected Truss’s demand that the Northern Ireland protocol be rewritten, and issued a blunt warning of retaliation if the government passes a law disapplying aspects of the agreement. “We can’t renegotiate the protocol: the ink on the signatures is hardly dry,” said João Vale de Almeida.",News/UK news,US delegation to fly to UK over Northern Ireland tensions,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/20/us-delegation-to-fly-to-uk-over-northern-ireland-tensions
5/20/2022,"Temperatures in parts of southern Spain are forecast to exceed 42C on Saturday as a heatwave of “extraordinary intensity” brings dusty skies, a heightened risk of forest fires and blistering conditions more usually seen in high summer than mid-May. The Spanish government activated its national plan for excess temperatures on Thursday evening after the state meteorological agency, Aemet, warned that Spain was facing “one of the hottest Mays in this country in recent years”. Aemet said a mass of hot, dry air is blowing in from Africa, carrying with it dust from the Sahara and “exceptionally high” daily temperatures that are between 10C and 15C above the seasonal average. “The last updates to the meteorological models confirm the extraordinary intensity of this heatwave,” said Rubén del Campo, a spokesperson for Aemet. “For Spain as a whole, it could be the most intense May heatwave of the past 20 years in terms of both the maximum and minimum temperatures. Friday and Saturday will be the hottest days in general terms and, although there will be an important drop in temperatures on Sunday across the western third of the peninsula, that could be the hottest day in parts of the eastern side of Spain and in the Balearic islands.” The forecaster said temperatures in Andalucía’s Guadalquivir valley could pass 40C on Friday and exceed 42C the next day. Even as the heat subsides elsewhere, he added, there could be temperatures of 40C or above in the north-eastern Ebro valley – “something unheard of in that area in May”. Spain recorded its highest ever temperature last August, when the mercury in the Andalucían town of Montoro reached 47.4C. Del Campo reminded people of the “extreme risk” of forest fires in southern, central and north-eastern areas, and also told them to expect another orange calima dust cloud. “This will be an extreme episode and the risk that comes with the high temperatures will be important in many areas,” he said. “Another thing to be aware of is dust in the air, which could lead to calimas in the south and east of the peninsula, with murky skies and reduced visibility. That concentration of dust in the air could increase on Friday and Saturday across the peninsula and the Balearic islands as air comes in from north Africa carrying the dust from the Sahara. That will again cause a decline in air quality.” The Spanish government advised people to keep hydrated and wear light clothing, adding that a close eye should be kept on children, pregnant women, and older and chronically ill people. The Saharan dust cloud is also due to blow over the UK, which experienced its hottest day of the year so far on Tuesday when temperatures in the south-east peaked at 27.5C. Spring heat records have also been broken in France as the country enters its 38th consecutive day of above-normal temperatures, with parts of the south already exceeding 33C and some models predicting temperatures will rise locally to 37C or even 39C by the end of the week, around 17C hotter than the seasonal average. The southern towns of Albi, Toulouse and Montélimar have all equalled or exceeded their previous records for the month of May, registering 33.7C, 33.4C and 33.8C respectively on Wednesday, while even La Hague in north-western Normandy reached 27C, breaking a record for May dating back to 1922. In Paris, the overnight temperature from Wednesday to Thursday did not fall lower than 20C, the first time that has happened so early in the year in the century and a half since records in the capital began. At 3am, the mercury was still close to 22C. The heatwave is expected to continue in southern France until at least Sunday and possibly Monday, Météo France said, adding: “This is an exceptional period of high temperatures in terms of how early in the year it has occurred, how long it is set to last, and how much of the country it covers.” The state forecaster said it was now “highly likely” that this would be the hottest May on record, with average temperatures forecast at least 3C above normal across the whole month, and locally much more. In 2011, the hottest May on record so far, average temperatures were only 1.8C higher than the norm. François Jobard, a Météo France forecaster, said France had not suffered a May heatwave “since national figures began to be compiled in 1947. The hottest day in May has always remained well below 25.3C. In fact, that temperature has never yet been reached in France before 20 June”. Water use has already been restricted in 16 of France’s départements (regions), with 22 – mainly in the south-east and south-west – reckoned to be “very likely” to suffer serious drought by the end of the summer. Worrying ozone levels were also recorded in the Rhône valley this week, authorities said. Météo France said such episodes of extreme heat are likely to become longer and more severe, start earlier and recur more frequently as global heating advances – although it added that there was no indication this year that the unusually hot spring heralded a record-breaking hot summer. Earlier this week, the UK Met Office said the chances of the record-breaking recent heatwave that has pushed temperatures in parts of India and Pakistan to 51C had been made over 100 times more likely because of the climate crisis.",News/World news,Spain braces for heat wave of ‘extraordinary intensity’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/spain-braces-for-heat-wave-of-extraordinary-intensity
5/20/2022,"A leading figure in the Biden administration has backed a recovery programme for Ukraine in the style of the Marshall plan, which helped rebuild Europe after the second world war. Pete Buttigieg, the US transportation secretary, said there was plenty of political will at home and internationally towards cooperating in long-term reconstruction efforts including to buttress existing infrastructure in Ukraine. “With the memory of the Marshall plan in mind, what we’re talking about is not only about how we fund immediate needs and support their ability to maintain the war effort, but how we support the ability of Ukraine to be economically viable and generate a sustainable future for themselves, even as they’re under attack,” the former presidential candidate said in an interview with the Guardian. Buttigieg admitted that while “the destruction of Ukrainian homes and infrastructure is still under way”, to talk about reconstruction might feel premature “and yet in my encounters with Ukrainian leaders, and particularly my counterpart [Oleksandr Kubrakov], who I speak to regularly, they are already thinking about reconstruction even as they’re thinking about defending their homeland and it’s inspiring to see and it deserves strong and unified support from us.” He said a “major topic of conversation” among transport ministers at the world meeting in Leipzig this week for the International Transport Forum was how they could help to get grain and other produce out of Ukraine, which is stuck because of blocked and destroyed ports and railway lines and is threatening to create a global food shortage. “This is not only something that concerns us, as friends to Ukraine, but also concerns us because the world needs that production, especially on the agricultural side,” he said. “Without access to the Black Sea, it’s always going to be a major disadvantage. We’re committed to helping there in any way we can. “But I really admire in my Ukrainian counterparts that they’re thinking about the short and the long term at the same time – how to shore up infrastructure in the immediate term – the heroic work by the railway workers to restore connections so that goods can be moved from west to east and people from east to west. “But they’re also thinking about very long-term questions and recognising that what they rebuild towards will not simply be a reconstruction of the Soviet-era infrastructure that this generation of Ukrainians has inherited.” Buttigieg was speaking on the sidelines of an event hosted by the German Marshall Fund NGO in Berlin to mark the 50th anniversary of the Marshall plan, a multibillion-dollar recovery programme initiated by the US in 1947 that provided humanitarian and economic assistance to millions of Europeans to ease their recovery after the second world war. The plan was named after George Marshall, the man who was then US secretary of state. Buttigieg, who is in charge of implementing and overseeing a large swathe of projects in the US enabled under the $1tn (£800bn) infrastructure bill that passed six months ago, stressed the relevance to the US as well as Ukraine of Marshall’s insistence about the need to create a “virtuous circle” between the economic security of a nation and its political stability based on its capacity to deliver. He said that decades of disinvestment in the US had turned the virtuous cycle into a vicious one, with political institutions that lacked the resources to deliver well losing their legitimacy, leading to an erosion of trust, “which has given credence to those who would undermine those institutions, further diminishing their capacity to deliver”, he said. The infrastructure fund was intended to break that cycle, he added. “If we can deliver as we’re setting out to do … then citizens will see what it means for them. We’ve got all kinds of things that have scrambled up our political and social life right now, including the information environment, the forms of extremism … and shocks like the pandemic, and economic reverberations from the war in Europe. It’s all the more reason for us to focus on delivering for people.” He said that the stakes included not just comfort and convenience, but “perhaps also the credibility of governance itself”. “In the 1930s, another season when democracy was in doubt, and when it had become fashionable in some circles in Washington to point approvingly to the rise in dictators, some would say by way of praise for fascism that Mussolini makes the trains run on time. “This turns out to not be particularly true, by the way … but how revealing it is that this excuse for autocrats comes on the basis of their supposed prowess in providing transportation.” Regarding Ukraine, Buttigieg said he was interested in President Volodymr Zelenskiy’s calls for reconstruction on a cities and regional level, under a plan apparently gaining traction, by which cities and communities across the world would adopt similar communities in Ukraine to their own ones. “Understanding the needs and different capacities of different parts of the country is going to be very important,” Buttigieg said. Asked if his government’s legitimacy over helping to rebuild a country was to be trusted after its chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, Buttigieg, who served in the country as an officer in the US Navy Reserve, said: “Part of what we were up against in Afghanistan is just how fundamentally different the society, the values, the governance culture and the economics of that country are … it’s very different in Ukraine … one of the things that unites us to Ukraine are some of those core values around democracy. “It’s so early to know what will be at the end of this upheaval. What we know is that the kind of united approach we have that reflects shared values among our partners and with Ukrainians is a very powerful one and will be an important basis of the relationship. “Not just in getting us through this war, whatever the endgame looks like, but in a reconstruction that really does hold the promise of leading to new and innovative things.” He praised the leadership he said Germany had shown since the start of the invasion, contrasting with the criticism the government of Olaf Scholz has received. “I think it’s understood in Washington that the new steps that Germany has taken are major steps in security and energy policy … none of us knows what lies on the other side of this Zeitenwende,” he said, adopting the phrase used by Scholz meaning “turning point”, “but all of us should recognise that the only way for it to lead to a good place is for us to find our way to it together.” Earlier on Thursday, Buttigieg took a tour of Berlin’s Hauptbahnhof or central station, a symbol of German unification, and met a group of Germans and US citizens of Ukrainian origin working as volunteers to receive refugees, about 2,000 of whom are arriving on trains from Ukraine each day. “Just make sure you help us by keeping the narrative alive back home,” one of the volunteers, Natalia, from Minnesota and of Ukrainian descent, told him as Buttigieg thanked the women for their work. Buttigieg, who ran for the US presidency in 2020 but withdrew in favour of supporting Joe Biden, would not be drawn on whether he had plans to run again in 2024. “Right now my ambitions are to be the best secretary of transportation that I can,” he said. “I think there’s never been a better time to have this job.”",News/World news,Pete Buttigieg says US backs new Marshall plan to rebuild Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/pete-buttigieg-says-us-backs-new-marshall-plan-to-rebuild-ukraine
5/20/2022,"In Irish mythology, a púca is a mischievous, shapeshifting spirit that can take the form of a horse and entice unwary travellers on to its back for a wild ride. Aidan Harte knows how that feels. Eighteen months ago the sculptor was commissioned to create a 2-metre tall bronze statue of a púca for the town square in Ennistymon, County Clare. What followed was a headlong gallop into a surreal controversy about the role of public art in Ireland that only now, perhaps, is coming to an end. Along the way Harte found himself trolled on social media, pilloried from the pulpit, championed by celebrities and credited as the unwitting inspiration for a music video featuring a mock execution. “It’s the oddest thing,” said Harte, 43. “The púca is like the English puck that plays tricks. This story kept on getting stranger and stranger until I wondered if there was a bit of his magic.” Clare county council decided in 2020 to spend €30,000 (£25,400) on a sculpture striking enough to attract tourists to Ennistymon, a town near the Atlantic coast. Harte won the tender and in early 2021 started work in his Dublin studio on what was to be The Púca of Ennistymon. For the artist, who had studied in Florence, it was a dream job – bigger in scale and prominence than anything he had done before. Harte sculpted a horse’s head and torso atop human legs. “A lot of public art in Ireland is abstract and corporate – nothing that anyone can get upset about. This was a full-blooded representation of one of the big forgotten characters of Irish folklore,” he said. He sought to convey ambiguity, he said. “The fairies are not good or bad, they’re something in between. The púca is a creature of chaos. It’s that uneasy, unexpected feeling I wanted to give the sculpture.” Harte got an uneasy, unexpected feeling of his own in April 2021 when photographs of the clay mould for the sculpture leaked to townsfolk in Ennistymon and elicited swift excoriation on social media. The sculpture was called ugly, frightening and hideous. The council was so taken aback it told Harte to pause the work. When, from his pulpit, the Ennistymon parish priest, Father Willie Cummins, denounced the sculpture as “sinister”, Irish media seized on the story. “Journalists got on to me. In a moment of weakness I said it was ‘Father Ted stuff’,” said Harte, who compared the row to an episode from the fictional priests on Channel 4’s sitcom. “They never let go of it.” Everyone seemed to have an opinion about the sculpture – “the scare from Clare” – which, without leaving its studio, spawned editorials, essays, tributes and denunciations. One man posted a selfie in which he was dressed as a druid and held a placard saying “down with this sort of thing”, a quote from Father Ted. An artist painted a mural depicting the sculpture along with a howling wolf, a fairy and a UFO. A representative of a tourist attraction in County Monaghan, 150 miles from Clare, lobbied Harte for the sculpture by penning a fictional short story entitled I Púca. A songwriter called Frank Callery composed a song lauding the sculpture but another composer – Enda Haran – wrote a riposte that envisaged blowing it up. “Your ugly horse can kiss my ’orse,” said one line. “It was basically a bit of craic with a serious edge to it in that nobody was consulted,” said Haran. “It had nothing to do with religion or the local priest.” A group calling itself The Burning Pitchforks made a video performing the song, which included a mock execution of someone dressed as a horse. #Ennistymon #mural featuring @HarteAidan’s #puca was painted by Johnny O’Gorman, commissioned by Stephan Unglert of the local bakery as heard @drivetimerte pic.twitter.com/Bdt8NaYsBG Rattled by the controversy, the council hired Connect the Dots, a community engagement firm based in Philadelphia and Dublin, to consult Ennistymon residents. In a poll that attracted 674 responses, 370, or 55%, objected to the púca. The report noted at least 79 mentions of “ugly”, 10 mentions of “scary”, 11 mentions of “hideous” and eight mentions of “eyesore”. Suggestions for alternative locations included “space near Pluto” and “bottom of the ocean”. Of the 291, or 44%, who favoured the sculpture, there was praise for its sense of fun and imagination. “Technically stunning, incredible craft and thematically rich,” said one. “Beautifully encapsulates the essence of the Púca legend – he is not supposed to be a cuddly character,” said another. Celebrities such as Dara Ó Briain, Imelda May and Chris O’Dowd tweeted support. In January the council decided it would not bring the sculpture to Ennistymon. “Have we really got to the stage where even the auld Púca must be cancelled?” lamented Diarmaid Ferriter, a historian, in the Irish Times. Last week however the council announced it had found a home at the Michael Cusack Centre – named after a founder of the Gaelic Athletic Association – in the village of Carron, 13 miles east of Ennistymon. “It took a long time to not go very far,” said Harte. “I’m delighted. It’s important that it goes somewhere that it’s loved.” A documentary maker plans to make a film and a cultural historian is studying the row but Harte wonders if anyone will ever make full sense of it all. The sculpture is being cast in metal and will be assembled and polished before moving to Carron in June. Harte hopes visitors will be bold enough to rub the Púca’s toe.",News/World news,"Why the long face?

5/20/2022,"The traditional owners of Juukan Gorge have signed a preliminary agreement with Rio Tinto to co-manage land that is still being mined for iron ore. The Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people said the mining giant broke their trust with the destruction of the 46,000-year-old Aboriginal heritage site, which was blown up by Rio Tinto in May 2020 in an effort to access more high-grade iron ore at its Brockman 4 mine. The traditional owners have demanded they be given a co-management role in determining the future of mines that fall within their native title area, which covers 10,888 sq km between Onslow and Tom Price in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The chair of the PKKP Aboriginal Corporation, Burchall Hayes, said the signing of a new heads of agreement this week was the first step in rebuilding that relationship. It outlines principles of co-management of Aboriginal heritage sites that fall within Rio’s mining leases on PKKP lands, including greater involvement by the PKKP on mining activities on their land and clear identification of which PKKP people speak for which area. “This agreement provides clear acknowledgment that Rio Tinto accepts that the destruction of the rock shelters should not have happened and makes clear that it is absolutely committed to listening, learning, changing and co-managing country,” Hayes said in a statement on Friday. “While the agreement is non-binding, we believe it is a clear signal of intent from Rio Tinto and one that will ultimately be tested in the co-management agreement that is reached.” Rio Tinto’s iron ore chief executive, Simon Trott, said the company “continues to reflect on the loss and hurt that we caused at Juukan Gorge which was a clear breach of our values”. “The PKKP people have graciously shared their knowledge to help inform our approach to best practice management and protection of cultural heritage as well as how we can deliver better social and economic outcomes on the ground,” Trott said. “Our discussions on these matters continue as we work to create a shared future.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The global investor fallout from destroying the shelters led to Rio placing a moratorium on mining within 10 sq km around the site, the value of which dwarfed that of the eight tonnes of high-grade ore accessed by destroying the heritage site. It also led to the chair of the board standing down and the departure of three senior Rio Tinto executives, including the chief executive. A parliamentary inquiry into the incident criticised the mining company and state and federal governments, finding there had been “failures at every level” in legislation as well as Rio’s own processes. It recommended an overhaul of Western Australian and federal heritage laws. New heritage laws passed by the WA government last year have been roundly criticised by traditional owners and legal experts. The laws are yet to take effect.

5/20/2022,"Pig came out of the deep, a slow-moving mass in search of an answer to the question arresting the mind of the nation: who will emerge from the federal election victorious? The dugong’s performance was precise and assured. A red and blue toy representing each major party were dropped into Pig’s enclosure, and after mere moments consulting his mystic powers, he disappeared below the water’s surface. In one long stride, he passed the blue floaty, diving straight to the sinking red bucket. The dugong’s choice was clear – Labor leader Anthony Albanese is set for victory. “I was expecting him to choose blue,” said Dayna Plater, senior dugong keeper at Sea Life Sydney Aquarium. “All of our uniforms here are blue. “He still chose to follow the red bucket down, and put it on his head and wear it as a hat.” For almost an hour, the lone blue toy floated by on the water’s surface, discarded and forgotten by Pig. The 23-year-old dugong has been at the Sydney Aquarium since being rescued in 2008, and is one of only two dugongs in care in the world. This is Pig’s first political prediction, and Plater has faith in him. But the dugong is not the only animal being consulted for an expert opinion. Speckles the psychic saltwater crocodile was presented with posters of Morrison and Albanese at Crocodylus Park in Darwin this week. Attached to each poster were slabs of meat. Though he took longer to come to his conclusion, Speckles finally landed on Albanese too. Over in the Australian Reptile Park, Hugo the oracle tortoise had a choice between two plates of lettuce, one sporting a picture of Morrison, and the other Albanese. The 71-year-old tortoise has seen 16 prime ministers in his lifetime, and appeared indecisive. He initially made his way towards Morrison before making a sharp turn towards Albanese. The result seemed certain. But in a sudden turn of events, Hugo forgot the fate of the nation. Spotting his girlfriend in the distance, Hugo bypassed both Morrison and Albanese. The Australia Electoral Commission is not impressed, assuring Australian voters that their staff counting ballots will not be so easily blinded by love. This is why Australian elections aren’t decided by lovesick tortoises. Our staff focus on counting every ballot paper and absolutely will not be distracted by Hugo’s girlfriend Estrella. And in an alternate move, Gloomy the octopus has predicted a Liberal win, wrapping its tentacles around a set of blue lego blocks also at Sea Life Sydney Aquarium. As for the accuracy of Pig’s prediction, Plater said: “I think Pig has chosen a clear winner today. “I’m excited to see if Pig is going to be correct.”",News/Australia news,Dugong sees red: Pig the sea cow predicts Labor will win Australian election (sort of),https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/dugong-sees-red-pig-the-sea-cow-predicts-labor-will-win-australian-election-sort-of
5/20/2022,"The Morrison government has been hit by an election-eve leak that cabinet’s national security committee blocked a proposal by the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, to double Australia’s support to the Pacific. Labor said the “extraordinary” pre-election leak, first reported by the Australian newspaper, showed the government was “falling apart”, while Scott Morrison insisted the committee was “extremely tight”. The revelation was expected to trigger renewed debate about the government’s Pacific policy in the wake of China signing a security deal with Solomon Islands. Guardian Australia has confirmed that the proposal advanced by Payne included an approximate doubling of Australia’s total financial support to Pacific island countries over four years. This package included foreign aid but the measures proposed to the national security committee are believed to have been broader. The proposal was partly driven by concerns that if Australia did not ramp up support to its friends and neighbours in the Pacific, the gap would be filled by others, including China. The policy, which was described internally as the next stage of the government’s Pacific step-up program, was being developed late last year and discussions continued into early 2022. It is understood the national security committee did not adopt the entire package although some elements were salvaged. For example, the budget handed down in March by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, included $350m in temporary and targeted support to assist the Pacific with Covid-19 recovery. The national security committee, chaired by Morrison, is responsible for decisions on major issues of strategic significance and its deliberations are usually tightly held. Its deputy chair is Barnaby Joyce and the other members are Frydenberg, Payne, Peter Dutton, Simon Birmingham, Karen Andrews and Michaelia Cash. When a reporter asked Morrison on Friday why members of his government were leaking against him, Morrison said he rejected that accusation “100%”. The prime minister defended his ministerial colleagues. “My national security committee has been extremely tight,” he said. Morrison said such meetings were “not just attended by ministers” but were “also attended by officials” – but he stopped short of saying he would launch a leak investigation. While declining to confirm or deny the substance of the report, he pushed back at the idea that increasing funding would thwart China’s activities in the region. “You’re suggesting if you double funding in the Pacific, somehow the Chinese government doesn’t have any influence or won’t be seeking to coerce or exert its influence,” Morrison told reporters in Perth. “That assumption doesn’t hold.” Labor’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, said the pre-election leak was “extraordinary”. “What this shows again is Mr Morrison dropping the ball,” Wong told ABC Radio National. “They simply did not ensure that they looked at how Australia could make sure we were the partner of choice. “How do we ensure that we secure our region? That’s the key strategic question. And on this Mr Morrison dropped the ball, and Australian security is paying the price.” Birmingham did not deny the substance of the story in the Australian. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “There’s no shortage of willingness from our government to invest,” the finance minister told ABC Radio National on Friday. “I’m just emphasising we have absolutely acted on much advice from Marise and we have increased support in the Pacific.” Birmingham said he would not enter into a public “debate” about the story, and Payne was “not going to debate what does or does not go to cabinet either”. Morrison has repeatedly argued that the government was not blindsided by the emergence of security negotiations between China and Solomon Islands, which led to the signing of a deal in the early stages of the Australian election campaign. After the signing, Morrison said Australia and the US shared the same “red line” when it came to opposing a Chinese military base in Solomon Islands, without specifying what action might be triggered if that line were crossed. Morrison has argued China is exerting “enormous pressure” on Pacific island countries, and has dismissed claims from Labor that the deal represents the biggest Australian foreign policy failure in the Pacific since the second world war. On Thursday he said he wanted to visit Solomon Islands and other Pacific island countries if re-elected on Saturday. Labor’s costings, released on Thursday, included a pledge to add $538m to Australia’s foreign aid budget for the Pacific over the next four years. The Labor policy is part of a broader package of measures aiming to “restore Australia’s place as first partner of choice for our Pacific family”. Dutton has repeatedly argued that China has taken an “aggressive” approach and operates “by very different rules” in seeking to deepen its influence in the region. Some of the rhetoric has angered the prime minister of Solomon Islands, Manasseh Sogavare, who said the country was being treated like kindergarten children. In April the head of the Office of National Intelligence, Andrew Shearer, denied that there had been an Australian intelligence failure, insisting that China had long been interested in expanding its presence across the Indo-Pacific. New Zealand’s foreign affairs minister, Nanaia Mahuta, later characterised it as “a relationship failure” in an interview with the Guardian. On Friday the Australian government said total support to the Pacific was $2.7bn this financial year. That figure included loans, security programs, health and financial support and “a record $1.85bn in official development assistance”. “We are easily the largest bilateral donor to the Pacific,” a government spokesperson said, pointing to the opening of six new diplomatic missions in the Pacific since 2018 and the doubling of the lending capacity of the Australian infrastructure financing facility for the Pacific, from $1.5bn to $3bn.",News/Australia news,"Cabinet committee blocked plan to double Australia’s support to Pacific, election-eve leak reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/cabinet-committee-blocked-plan-to-double-australias-support-to-pacific-election-eve-leak-reveals
5/20/2022,"With the polls tightening in the final days of the election campaign, both major parties are preparing for a tight contest on Saturday. Labor, after carrying the scars of the 2019 loss which it was widely expected to win, is being more cautious about predicting wins from the Liberal party this time round. But Labor is desperately hoping the widespread anti-Morrison sentiment is enough to deliver it government under a “safe change” strategy that has seen the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, adopt a small-target approach and run a low-key campaign. The magic number for majority government is 76 seats in the 151-seat House of Representatives. Labor holds a notional 69 seats, so needs a net gain of seven seats for a majority government, but could form minority government if it wins just five. The Coalition holds only 75 seats after the defection of the United Australia party leader, Craig Kelly, to the crossbench, so also needs to win seats to maintain its majority. The Coalition has thrown the kitchen sink at trying to shore up its position, and believes there remains a narrow path to victory if it can win seats off the Labor party. Everything will need to go right for the Coalition for it to remain in government, and it is hoping that undecided voters will choose to stick with the devil they know when they vote on Saturday. Only one thing is for certain – this election will throw up new quirks and trends that are not yet known, as we emerge from a once-in-a-century pandemic that has seen voters across Australia live very different experiences. So what are the possible scenarios – and seats – that may determine the victor on election night? If the swing is on and voters decide it’s time to boot the Morrison government, then Labor will expect to pick up seats in every state. The seats most likely to fall to Labor in this scenario are Pearce and Swan in Western Australia, Boothby in South Australia, Chisholm and Higgins in Victoria, Reid, Robertson and possibly Bennelong in New South Wales, Bass and Braddon in Tasmania, and Brisbane, Longman and Leichhardt in Queensland. Winning these 13 seats, which would give Labor a comfortable majority of 82, is an optimistic scenario, and both sides say it is unlikely all of these Coalition-held seats will fall. For comparison, it is worth noting that in the 2007 “Ruddslide” election, Labor secured 83 of the House of Representatives’s 150 seats after being comfortably ahead in the polls against John Howard in the run up to polling day. Labor’s primary vote in the election-eve Newspoll in 2007 was 46%, compared with 41% for the Coalition. Ahead of this election, Labor’s primary vote in the Guardian Essential poll is at 35% compared with 36% for the Coalition, making the result much more difficult to predict. A more realistic scenario is that Labor wins some – but not all – of these Coalition-held seats, and is able to win the seven seats needed to govern in its own right. While a narrow Labor majority government is the most likely outcome based on current polling numbers, it is by no means guaranteed. If Labor can hang on to all of its seats, but can only secure five of the above-mentioned seats, it can be confident of forming minority government. The five seats the Labor party is most confident about winning are Pearce, Swan, Boothby, Chisholm and Reid. If it can get across the line in these five key marginals, then it would have a total of 74 seats – two short of the magic number. In this scenario, Labor would be confident of securing support from the Greens MP Adam Bandt and Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie to deliver minority government. While Albanese has ruled out doing any deals with the Greens, Bandt has released his seven key demands for backing a Labor government. Winning five seats and not losing any of those it already holds is the worst Labor can do and still be confident of forming government. If the Coalition can sandbag seats and limit its losses, and pick up seats from Labor elsewhere, then there remains a small chance that the Liberals and Nationals can remain in majority government. Let’s say Labor wins the five seats above – Pearce, Swan, Boothby, Chisholm and Reid – then the Coalition’s numbers have been reduced to 70, compared with Labor’s 74. But the Coalition has been aggressively targeting the Labor-held marginal seats of Gilmore, Corangamite, McEwen, Hunter, Parramatta, Lyons and Lingiari, with a notable focus on outer-suburban and regional areas. It is also expected to win back the seat of Hughes from Kelly. For each of these Labor seats that the Coalition can win – if any – the opposition would need to find another Coalition-held seat further up the pendulum to ensure it could form government. If Labor wins all five of its most likely target seats, but the Coalition can win five of these seven target seats from Labor, the Coalition retains its 76-seat majority (assuming it wins back Hughes). This would be an extraordinary result for the Coalition and while it is a more unlikely scenario it is certainly a possibility. Any combination of the above could also see the Coalition maintain its majority – providing it offsets any losses with the same number of gains elsewhere. This scenario could be helped by the allocation of United Australia and One Nation preferences, which in some marginal seats are being directed to the Coalition. It’s worth noting, though, that minor party preferences only have a limited impact on the result given voters don’t always follow how to vote recommendations, and will only matter in tight contests. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, says he is aiming for a majority government, but this is an unlikely scenario given the pressure the Coalition faces both in marginal seats and so-called teal seats. If Labor falls short of a net gain of five seats, then the Coalition could potentially form a minority government. If Labor wins four seats, it would have more seats than the Coalition on 73, compared with 72 for the Liberals and Nationals (providing the Liberals win back Hughes, but nothing else). While Labor would be confident of winning over Bandt and Wilkie, it is possible that the remaining four MPs on the crossbench could back in the Coalition. Rebekha Sharkie, the MP for the seat of Mayo, has indicated that she would be more likely to back the Coalition in the event of a hung parliament, while Zali Steggall has suggested she would be more likely to support the Liberal party if Morrison was dumped. Bob Katter and Helen Haines have not declared who they would back in the event of a hung parliament, but given they both come from traditionally conservative electorates, they are seen as more likely to back the Coalition. Of course, this scenario is based on the crossbench of the 46th parliament staying the same after the election. Given there are many seats where other independents are seen as a strong chance of success, the crossbench could well look different after Saturday’s poll. There are at least five “teal” independents who have a strong chance of winning seats from the Liberal party, and none of these have indicated who they would support in the event of a hung parliament. The Greens could also pick up another seat from either Labor or the Liberal party, as could regional independents targeting Liberal and National MPs. The more independents elected in place of Liberal MPs, the more difficult it will be for the Coalition to remain in government – either minority or majority – regardless of the traditional political alignment of the seat. If the election is tight, then it is possible we will not know the result on Saturday. The Australian Electoral Commission does not start counting postal votes until Sunday morning, and at this election more than 2.5 million people have requested postal votes from the AEC so far. In the event of a hung parliament, the result may not be known for many days – or even weeks as negotiations with independents take place. In 2010, it took 17 days before crossbench MPs decided to support Julia Gillard as prime minister. Traditionally, the winner waits until receiving a concession call from their opponent before declaring victory on election night. Both Albanese and Morrison will have their phones at the ready.",News/Australia news,Who will win?

5/20/2022,"For the veteran political correspondent Laura Tingle, elections are “stupid and depressing”, and this one has been no different. What with Anthony Albanese “basically just going around and kissing babies” and Scott Morrison avoiding all the places where “voters hate him so much”, it’s been a “strange campaign”, the ABC stalwart told Malcolm Farr on the Judith Neilson Institute’s election podcast. She said press conferences may seem “shouty and aggressive” but the travelling circus was doing its best under difficult circumstances. But on Thursday, Tingle wasn’t so charitable. The 7.30 chief political correspondent lost her patience as the media repeatedly tried to catch Albanese out over his election costings. She called the display “embarrassing” and, once, again the behaviour of the press came under the spotlight. Sorry. But this is embarrassing for my profession pic.twitter.com/Ud7lUo8pxP Tingle also took a swipe at Morrison for avoiding scrutiny during the campaign, including turning down an invitation to address the National Press Club and an ABC debate. “If politicians don’t want to speak to the ABC, that’s fine,” she said. “That’s really fine. But they think that they’re somehow punishing the ABC journalists for that. Whereas my view is they are actually accountable.” It wasn’t only the ABC that was largely ignored by the prime minister, SBS’s Indigenous broadcaster, NITV, was dismissed by Morrison when he was confronted about why no one from the Coalition had accepted an invitation to appear on The Point’s election special. When the SBS political correspondent Shuba Krishnan asked him why no one would appear he continued walking towards his car and said: “We’re investing $30m in connectivity … that’s how you close the gap.” SBS Political Correspondent @ShubaSKrishnan tried to get the Prime Minister on why no one from the Coalition was available for NITV while campaigning in Lingiari (the seat with the highest percentage of Aboriginal voters in the country)Here is the response. 👇🏽 👇🏽👇🏽 pic.twitter.com/B1PCjWu7GE When Labor’s Linda Burney and the Greens’ Lidia Thorpe joined John Paul Janke and Narelda Jacobs for a discussion about key Indigenous issues, there was an empty chair for the Coalition. We asked the prime minister’s office why no one was made available to talk to NITV but it ignored us too. One feature of the campaign has been the Australian’s Sharri Markson’s highly critical pieces on candidates who she says have not been supportive enough of Israel. Anthony Albanese was a vigorous critic of Israel, Markson wrote this week. His position was there in “black and white, for all to see” – and “it’s not pretty”, she said on Sky News. For the record, Albanese has condemned the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement and reaffirmed Labor’s strong support of Israel. Earlier in the campaign Markson revealed that the independent candidate for Goldstein, Zoe Daniel, had signed an open letter last year which referred to Israel as an “apartheid regime” and accused it of launching a “brutal war against the besieged population of Gaza”. Daniel is now on the record saying “the word, ‘Apartheid’, should not be used to describe the situation in Israel” and proclaiming herself “a strong supporter of Israel as a Jewish State, existing within safe and secure borders”. Markson also highlighted in another article that the climate activist Blair Palese, who was linked to the independent candidate for Wentworth, Allegra Spender, had once expressed support for the BDS movement on social media. Spender has said she strongly opposes the BDS movement and also expressed strong support for the Jewish community and Israel. In a revealing interview with the Australian Jewish News, headlined “Sharri Markson’s brilliant career”, the reporter explained her motivation for pursuing candidates over their historic attitudes towards Israel. “The sentiment in the leftwing media to attack Israel is deeply upsetting and it makes me really, really angry – absolutely furious,” she told the AJN. “I’m really worried that if the Labor party gets in in the next federal election there won’t be the same support for Israel that we have seen under the Coalition government.” Scott Morrison won significantly more mentions in the media during the six-week campaign than his opponent, tracking 47,877 mentions to Anthony Albanese’s 39,914, or 55% to 45%, according to Streem data. But it was Albanese who won the dubious prize of the most negative press, in particular in Rupert Murdoch’s newspapers and on Sky News Australia. Just one example of a personal attack came this week from Miranda Devine, who has de-camped to the New York Post but continues to write for the Daily Telegraph. At an Italian club, Albo finally found “a few people who can pronounce his Italian surname correctly”, Devine said. “Not that pronunciation is the opposition leader’s strong suit.” “After a campaign full of ‘deshishions’, ‘lejushlashun’, the ‘conomy’ and the ‘shituashun’ in ‘Straya’, it’s hard to believe Australia might have a prime minister heading to the Quad meeting in Tokyo next week with such a lazy tongue.” She went on to accuse the man who grew up in public housing of being unable to pronounce even his own name. Devine’s nasty piece was in stark contrast to the profile of Jenny Morrison produced by James Massola in the Sydney Morning Herald this week: ‘She’s just lovely’: Jenny Morrison joins Scott Morrison on the campaign trail. “Morrison regularly casts his eye around for a half-second, here and there, mentally locating Jenny; you can hear it in his voice, too, as he calls out ‘c’mon Jen’ as the touring party prepares to dash to the next event and he reaches for his wife’s hand once more,” Massola wrote. Oh, James. Really. Is that what passes for ""Analysis"" now at @smh?‘She’s just lovely’: Jenny Morrison joins Scott Morrison on the campaign trail https://t.co/l8u8B3aR1F “If Jenny Morrison could meet 50.1% of voters, Scott Morrison would be prime minister for life.” According to Streem, the major issues canvassed in the media this campaign have been the cost of living, Covid, employment, housing, budget and climate change, with the PM’s major topic the cost of living while Albanese’s was employment. After November’s debacle at the Kennedy awards when the Australian Financial Review’s Michael Roddan was ejected from the journalism prize night for labelling it the “Bogan Walkleys”, we thought the annual event couldn’t get any weirder. We were wrong. David Ross revealed in the Australian that the Kennedys have received $100,000 from two rightwing Queensland organisations, one of which is reportedly part of a group that has supported challenges to anti-vaccination mandates: the newly formed AJA and TNT Radio. They will now be known as the AJA Kennedy awards. The Australian Journalists’ Association is a new, alternative and unregistered, professional association started by the Red Union, which also formed the Nurses Professional Association of Queensland. The AJA is also the name of the original union for journalists formed in 1912. The name was dropped when it amalgamated with the union for performers to form the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance in 1992. The MEAA, which has sought legal advice over the use of the name and the logo, has accused the Kennedy awards of doing themselves “a disservice” by associating with the new AJA. “MEAA has become aware of another organisation purporting to be a union for journalists in Australia,” the union said after the sponsorship was revealed. “This organisation is not a federally registered union and does not represent journalists. Their operations appear clouded in secrecy. The only evidence of activity seems to indicate some sort of political agenda around opposition to vaccines.” A hub director of the AJA parent group reportedly rejected suggestions by the ACTU that it was a “fake union”, saying: “Whatever. Who cares? Australian journalists, most of whom are smart, will judge us by what we do.” With the networks not rushing to broadcast Clive Palmer’s campaign launch, the United Australia party founder was forced to buy primetime airtime on networks 10 and Seven as well as an afternoon slot on Nine. Palmer has of course already spent millions buying advertising across newspapers, billboards, digital media and TV. pic.twitter.com/bpJaytC0Pe Viewers who happened to land on Channel 10 on Wednesday might have been surprised by the hour-long advertisement for the Palmer party, filmed at his Coolum resort in April. “The following program has been produced and paid for by the United Australia party. Authorised by Clive Palmer for the United Australia party, Brisbane,” they were told. The Paramount Australia and New Zealand boss, Beverley McGarvey, said in a note to staff: “An election campaign doesn’t happen without the ads. If you’re like us you would be sick of seeing them right now, which means our revenue ad sales team have done a sensational job. Well done.” As far as ratings go, The Party Policy Launch was a flop, with 58,000 metro viewers tuning in and 230,000 switching off from 10’s lead-in program. Palmer’s jet has also came in handy for the billionaire who, unlike Morrison and Albanese, doesn’t have the company of the travelling press as he goes about his campaign. The mining billionaire took three journalists along for the ride when he was campaigning in central Queensland this week: Charlie Peel from the Australian, Zach Hope from the Brisbane Times and Tim Arvier from Channel Nine. Guardian Australia and the ABC did not get the invitation. Palmer may have regretted the jaunt, however, as Hope captured the event with style, documenting that Palmer had two lunches and forgot the name of one of the UAP’s local candidates, Tanya Wieden, whom he mistakenly called Tracey. Peel reported that “about 100 party members met Mr Palmer at rallies in Cairns and Gladstone on Tuesday morning”.",News/Media,Laura Tingle laments ‘stupid and depressing’ election campaign as Morrison dodges ABC debate | Weekly Beast,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/20/laura-tingle-laments-stupid-and-depressing-election-campaign-as-morrison-dodges-abc-debate
5/20/2022,"Here is everything you need to know about the voting process in the 2022 Australia election. The 2022 Australian federal election day is Saturday, 21 May. You can find your electorate by entering your address on this page on the AEC website. The results of the 2019 election in each electorate are on the commission’s Tally Room site, but bear in mind that boundaries of some seats in Victoria and Western Australia have changed since then. You can read about what those changes mean on the election blog of the ABC’s Antony Green. If you are unable to cast a ballot in person at a polling station on election day, there are several other ways to vote. At this election extra provision has been made to ensure those affected by the recent floods in Queensland and NSW, and people affected by Covid, are not disenfranchised. At the ballot box, you will be handed two pieces of paper. The smaller is for the House of Representatives, which is elected using preferential voting. You must number every box in order of your preference for your vote to be valid. The larger is for the Senate, which consists of 76 members, 12 for each state, and two for each territory. On the Senate ballot paper, you can vote in one of two ways. First, you can number at least six boxes above the line, indicating the parties or groups you prefer in the order of your choice. Or you can vote below the line, meaning you are voting individually for the candidates nominated by each party or group. In this case you must number at least 12 boxes to cast a valid vote. The AEC has expanded the provision of voting by phone (traditionally used for blind or low-vision Australians) to accommodate people who may be required to isolate because they have Covid or they are a close contact of someone who does. However, it has warned the process may not be entirely flawless. Originally the rules meant that only those who tested positive for Covid after 6pm on Tuesday 17 May would be eligible to vote via phone. However, after legal threats and complaints that the rule would effectively mean over 100,000 people would not be able to vote, the AEC indicated it would change the rules so that anyone who tested positive from 6pm on Friday 13 May can vote via phone. If you can’t make it on the day, you can vote in advance at a pre-polling station. A list of these is published on the AEC website. Mobile polling facilities are also set up in some hospitals, nursing homes, prisons and remote areas in advance of polling day, although at this election that service will be limited by Covid considerations (see below). It is too late to apply for postal voting. In some countries you may be able to access an overseas voting centre – you can find a list here. Otherwise you would have needed to apply for a postal vote, allowing enough time for the papers to be mailed to you. It’s a hallmark of Australia’s democratic process that once you complete your civic duty you are able to get a sausage sizzle or some other snack from one of the stalls at the place you’ve voted. There is now a website you can go to if you want to find the best food available in your electorate. It’ll tell you what is on offer, from sausage sizzles with vegetarian and Halal options, to cake stalls and lollies. It’ll also tell you whether there’s wheelchair accessibility and what hours the booth is open. Some polling places have gone to a lot of trouble with their stalls in the past, so no doubt we will see some more of that on Saturday. Some high effort cake and sausage offerings from elections past. Let us know what you find out there on Saturday! #democracysausage #sausageflashbacks pic.twitter.com/QMXQ3009lf There are 151 members of the House of Representatives, so one party needs to win at least 76 seats to form a majority government. Going into the election, the Liberal-National Coalition holds 76 seats, Labor holds 69 and the six others are held by minor parties and independents. To reach 76, Labor would need to retain their current number of seats and gain another seven. However, picking up an extra four seats from Liberal or Nationals would be enough for them to overtake the Coalition. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It may well be tight. According to analysis by Green: “Labor needs a uniform swing of 3.1% to gain four seats and 3.3% to gain seven. Yet Labor is defending 13 seats on a margin of up to 3%.” If the Coalition loses even one seat, but Labor fails to gain seven, Australia would have a hung parliament. In that case one or other of the major parties would have to secure the support of enough minor party or independent MPs to form government. A new wave of independents is running in Coalition-held seats at this election, which may increase the chances of a hung parliament. In the last week of the campaign, the polls have tightened, but Labor is still ahead. In the latest Guardian Essential poll, Labor has a two-point lead in the poll’s two-party-preferred “plus” measure with the opposition on 48% and the Coalition on 46%.

5/20/2022,"On Thursday finance minister Grant Robertson laid out the fifth budget of his career – and easily his most conservative. It was a remarkable reversal for a politician who, only two years ago, was staring down the early months of a devastating pandemic, releasing billions of dollars in economic stimulus. That stimulus was responsible for securing a record low unemployment rate, achieving a record run of economic growth and – if Robertson’s worst critics are correct – record growth in inflation. And that was the background to Thursday’s announcement. Inflation is running a little shy of 7% and forecasters warn that relief is unlikely in the short term. Petrol prices are over $3 a litre in most centres, food prices only go one way (up) and interest rate rises are certain to occur over the short to medium term, increasing the cost of servicing a mortgage. In a different year, Robertson’s response might have tracked along traditional lines. Drawing on the Labour tradition, he might have drawn down a few billion more to offer universal relief, perhaps in the form of publicly funded dental care or a publicly funded ambulance service. But in this year, as inflation reaches 9% in countries like the UK, the finance minister delivered a budget former conservative National party prime ministers Bill English and John Key might have been proud of. To those on Robertson’s left this is – at worst – heretical. At best, it’s a disappointment. But the economic conditions demand a tightrope act. If the government increases stimulus, inflation could match it, pushing prices higher than ever. If the government refuses to act, withholding support from the most vulnerable and the “squeezed middle”, it risks pushing more and more people into poverty. That’s an intolerable outcome. And so Robertson is releasing a series of targeted measures: $350 in cost-of-living relief for people earning $70,000 or less; extending the half-price subsidy for public transport for two months, and making it permanent for community service card holders; extending the hold on the fuel excise tax, perhaps helping to keep petrol prices at $3; and increasing various discretionary grants. The government is lifting the ceiling for the dental emergency grant, for example, from $300 to $1,000. Taken together, these measures could help more than 2 million New Zealanders offset the worst impacts of inflation. In fact, the cut to the fuel excise tax is helping shave 0.5% off inflation. Robertson’s critics might argue that this conservative, precisely targeted approach is unnecessary. In her budget speech the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, argued that inflation was, for the most part, imported. Supply chain disruptions and the war in Ukraine were responsible for rising prices, rather than government spending and domestic demand. That seems reasonable, and even the orthodox economists acknowledge as much. The price of petrol, for example, is almost entirely a product of the war in Ukraine. Yet its impacts are felt across the domestic economy: everything from the cost of moving freight to the cost of getting to work is increasing. That leaves the government with few policy tools to help shelter New Zealanders from rising prices. This reading of inflation leaves keen observers with one obvious question: if inflation is mostly imported, why not spend more ambitiously? Economists talk about the inflationary thief, an intruder that – when he breaks into the economy – steals the value of wages and savings. As inflation rises, the amount you can buy with your wages decreases. So too does the value of your savings. In the plainest terms, this means the poorest New Zealanders will struggle. Their money won’t go as far as it did even a year ago. With that pressing need it seems remiss, even neglectful, of the government not to increase spending to take – using the prime minister’s words – the “hard edge” off of the cost-of-living crisis. In 2020, when Robertson delivered his third budget, the country was taking its first, tentative steps out of a two-month-long lockdown. Amid that uncertainty, and amid the unprecedented financial stress many people were under, Robertson released billions into the economy to support everything from wage subsidies to rail upgrades. In his fourth budget he dramatically increased benefits helping reverse the savagery of Ruth Richardson’s “mother of all budgets” in 1991. In those budgets – 2020 and 2021 - we saw a tantalising glimpse of a possible “Red Robbo”, committed to offsetting the worst impacts of capitalism. But in 2022 we witness a return to form and a social democrat perhaps more committed to simply offsetting the worst impacts of the business cycle. That’s disillusioning for leftists. But that moderation might be enough to win back the fickle centrists departing to the National party. And in the end, this is perhaps a set piece for winning back those voters and guaranteeing a third term in 2023.

5/20/2022,"Clive Palmer’s United Australia party is burning through its projected $70m election advertising spend, including hour-long television commercials, as a data analyst warns the fringe party could have more backing than polls predict, with some voters embarrassed to voice their support. At 9.45pm on Wednesday – hours before the blackout for election ads on broadcast media came into effect – Channel 10 ran an hour-long UAP ad which marketing analysts believe cost up to $600k but would have been discounted due to the mammoth ad spend by the party. It was the third time the UAP had paid for the hour-long ad, which ran on Channel 9 and 7flix in recent days. Billed as the UAP campaign launch that had happened weeks earlier, the broadcast featured speeches from Palmer – who is running as a Senate candidate for UAP in Queensland – and Craig Kelly – the party’s head who is widely expected to lose his lower house seat of Hughes. The speeches were delivered in front of a raucous, applauding crowd wearing yellow party hats. The speeches were broken up with what appeared to be ad breaks showing short promotions of different UAP policies, such as capping mortgage repayment rates at 3%, permanently freezing the fuel excise, and warning that “mass biometric surveillance” was in use in Australia. The cost of the hour-long TV ads pales in comparison to the eye-watering $70m Palmer had vowed to spend on advertising by election day. On YouTube, the UAP spent $9.58m on ads from the beginning of February until 8 May. The party spent $2.38m in the week ending 8 May, according to the most up-to-date figures available, and this weekly spend is understood to have increased since. Meanwhile, the federal Labor party has spent about $1.9m on YouTube ads since the beginning of the year, while the Liberal party has spent about $750,000. Parties have spent less on Facebook and Instagram, but the UAP and Palmer’s personal pages spent $874,000 in ads between 15 February and 15 May, more than double the Liberal Party’s $402,000 in that period, while Labor has spent $1.73m. On Thursday, Guardian Australia reported that experts have denounced a “misleading” claim perpetuated by the United Australia party, and some government MPs, that the World Health Organization will use a possible pandemic treaty to control Australia’s health system, including to arbitrarily impose lockdowns. Now that the broadcast blackout is in effect, the UAP – like the other parties and candidates – is expected to ramp up its ads on social media and other mediums. However as Palmer and Kelly travelled across the country this week to spruik candidates, the party’s image was dealt a blow with reports detailing how more than 20 of UAP’s 173 candidates across the lower and upper houses have faced court in the past or face ongoing matters. They include offences such as unlawful assault, domestic violence, stalking, burglary, intentional destruction of property, trafficking of a controlled drug and medium range drink-driving. Kelly and a party spokesperson defended the party’s vetting process reportedly saying that the UAP had conducted police checks, social media checks and formal interviews to choose candidates. On Wednesday, the party’s candidate in the Melbourne seat of Higgins was granted bail in time for election day. This election, the UAP is directing voters to preference Liberal and Nationals candidates ahead of Labor in a swathe of key seats. UAP preference flows were viewed as helping the Coalition retain seats and enjoy swings at the 2019 election. When the Guardian visited an early polling centre in the eastern Sydney seat of Wentworth last week, more than a quarter of those exiting saidthey voted in favour of the UAP. Several said they were previously swing voters but were attracted by the anti-vaccine mandate and Covid restriction policies of the party. Data analyst Elisa Choy said she believes most polling companies are not capturing the real level of support for the UAP. Ahead of the election, Choy’s company, Maven Data, has scraped thousands of terabytes of information from social media, search trends, news sites and blogs, in an attempt to gain insights into voter sentiment. Maven then scans the data for emotive language, and applies an artificial intelligence tool to gauge the popularity of different political issues and parties. “What I’m seeing is that we, Australians, are not enamoured with either of the major party leaders,” Choy said. “The hard views I have based on the data is that while we are seeing the rise of teal independents in key seats, the UAP appears to be successful in tapping into the great deal of disillusionment across many seats.” Choy said she believed polling participants often don’t respond truthfully, and don’t talk openly about their views, if they think they’ll be judged. “The silent majority of Australians don’t signal things in person or comment their views on social media, but we can look at what they’re reading or watching and what they’re searching on Google when they feel safe that no one is watching them,” she said. While the number of hardcore anti-vaxxers yet to receive any Covid-19 vaccine is low across the country, Choy said that voters sympathetic to UAP could include a much larger share of Australians who felt nudged into getting vaccinated due to government vaccine rules, while others resented harsh Covid restrictions. Choy said her analysis points to topics such as climate change, integrity, interest rates and the cost of living as being most likely to influence voters.",News/Australia news,"United Australia Party may have more backing than polls suggest, with voters too embarrassed to voice support, analysis shows",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/uap-may-have-more-backing-than-polls-suggest-with-voters-too-embarrassed-to-voice-support-analysis-shows
5/20/2022,"The AFL grand final will stick to its usual afternoon time slot at the MCG as the 2022 premiership flag decider returns to Melbourne for the first time in two years, in a win for traditionalists who were resistant to the idea of shifting the start time by two hours. In an acknowledgment of broad fan sentiment, this year’s showpiece event on 24 September will begin at 2.30pm AEST, after the last two grand finals were forced interstate by the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and played later in the day. Last year’s decider – a twilight start at Perth’s Optus Stadium – was considered a roaring success, while the 2020 game was a night fixture played at the Gabba in Brisbane. But recent polling of fans had indicated a prevailing preference for an afternoon start – an AFL Fans Association survey revealed 79.9% wanted an afternoon start, while 17.3% preferred a twilight game and just 2.8% a night clash. The AFL’s chief executive Gillon McLachlan said the league appreciated the success of last year’s match in Perth, but a return to normality post-Covid restrictions was the deciding factor. “Prior to the start of this season, we emphasised that after two really challenging years, we all yearned to return to the footy rituals and routines that set the rhythms of our lives, to continue to focus on getting back to football and going to football as we know it,” McLachlan said in a statement. “That return-to-rituals principle underpinned our decision making in ratifying a traditional start time – the prestige, nostalgia and atmosphere of the day grand final is something we all know and love. “Our role is to deliver fans the best possible game experience, whether that be at the match or the millions watching the broadcast, and together with our broadcast partner the Seven Network, we remain committed to creating an amazing event, and seeing 100,000 fans return to the MCG on that last Saturday in September.” AFL Fans Association president Cheryl Critchley said the 2.30pm start was part of the game’s unique tradition and thanked the AFL for respecting “the preference of most fans” by returning the game to its usual time slot. “Polls have long shown that most supporters prefer a day game, and this sentiment has strengthened since we had a night grand final in 2020,” Critchley said. “Most fans have made sacrifices throughout the pandemic, including paying good money for memberships they could not use for extended periods. It’s great to see that loyalty rewarded. “Let’s hope this tradition continues.”",Sport/Sport,AFL grand final to return to traditional time slot at MCG in win for fans,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/20/afl-grand-final-to-return-to-traditional-time-slot-at-mcg-in-win-for-fans
5/20/2022,"The US House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has warned that unilateral UK legislation affecting the Northern Ireland protocol could endanger British prospects for a free trade deal with the US. Pelosi’s bluntly worded intervention came two days after the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, confirmed that the government was planning to table legislation that would nullify parts of the protocol by exempting some goods moving between Great Britain and Ireland from EU customs checks. Pelosi made clear that she viewed the protocol as essential to maintaining the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement which minimised border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The Northern Ireland protocol was the outcome of negotiations with the EU on how to keep the frictionless border between the Irelands and maintain EU customs boundaries after Brexit. “As I have stated in my conversations with the prime minister, the foreign secretary and members of the House of Commons, if the United Kingdom chooses to undermine the Good Friday accords, the Congress cannot and will not support a bilateral free trade agreement with the United Kingdom,” the Speaker said in a written statement. The EU has already warned of a potential trade war if the UK moves ahead with its legislation. “It is deeply concerning that the United Kingdom now seeks to unilaterally discard the Northern Ireland protocol, which preserves the important progress and stability forged by the accords. It continues to enjoy strong bipartisan and bicameral support in the United States Congress,” Pelosi added. The warning follows a visit to Washington by the prime minister’s newly appointed special envoy for the Northern Ireland protocol in the US, Conor Burns, to explain the UK position to the Biden administration and to Congress, which is to blame the EU for inflexibility. US officials were irritated however that Burns, having emphasised his close personal relationship with Boris Johnson, had not warned them that Johnson was about to visit Northern Ireland. Burns assured them that no decisions had been made on whether to pursue new legislation, days before Truss made her announcement. “Respectful of the will of the British people and of Brexit, I urge constructive, collaborative and good-faith negotiations to implement an agreement that upholds peace,” Pelosi wrote on Thursday evening. “The children of Northern Ireland, who have never known the bloody conflict and do not want to go back, deserve a future free of the violence where all may reach their fulfillment.”",News/US news,Pelosi warns changes to Northern Ireland protocol could affect US trade deal with Britain,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/20/pelosi-warns-changes-to-northern-ireland-protocol-could-affect-us-trade-deal-with-britain
5/20/2022,"If Labor’s candidate in the south-west Sydney seat of Fowler, Kristina Keneally, is worried that being seen as a blow-in that could cost Labor one of its deep red jewels, it certainly isn’t showing. “I’m energised,” she says. “I love doing this.” She greets people as they arrive at Fairfield Leisure Centre, the largest of the pre-poll places in the electorate on Thursday. Surrounded by an army of people in Labor T-shirts handing out how-to-votes, she’s greeted warmly by voters. As the former premier, she’s well known, even if she has lived until recently outside the electorate. The presenter of Monk TV, in his saffron robes, is shooting a video for YouTube nearby. He asks if she’ll go on camera to explain to people how to fill out all the squares. Keneally happily obliges. But despite having a margin of 14% – making it safe Labor – this multicultural seat has become a fierce battleground where dirty tricks and slurs are par for the course and parts of the News Corp media empire are now propelling a narrative that Keneally could lose to deputy mayor, Dai Le, who is running as an independent. On Monday the Daily Telegraph ran an article by Sky’s Outsiders host, James Morrow who reported that Keneally’s vote was “collapsing”, triggering further stories. Morrow’s story was based on polling by Laidlaw Campaigns of 618 people in Fowler which according to Morrow, found Keneally’s primary vote was collapsing. By Tuesday, the polling had become a major story on Sky News. Despite the lack of detail about the poll questions and no disclosure about who had commissioned it, the Morrow story made news bulletins. One reporter referred to it as “polling commissioned by News Corp” in her report, but this was unable to be confirmed. Soon it was picked up by Sky’s New’s Paul Murray and Peta Credlin in their programs. “She’s a fair dinkum independent, not part of the teal tribe or anything like that,” said Credlin, who has led the charge on unmasking any past political affiliations of independents running in safe Liberal seats. Caroline Di Russo, a SkyNews.com.au contributor, wrote a first-person article online about the importance of being local. The Guardian has not seen the poll, but according to Morrow it was conducted three weeks ago and found that Keneally’s primary vote was down nearly 13 points to 42%. But when poll participants were asked further questions “about the importance of living locally and Keneally’s record as premier”, her primary vote fell further, Morrow reported. This put the independent Le in striking distance. Morrow did not reply to queries nor did the Telegraph’s editor, Ben English. Polling in individual seats is notoriously difficult because of the difficulty of getting an accurate sample reflecting the demographics of the area. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It’s also important to know who commissioned the poll and the questions asked. Andrew Laidlaw, the principal of Laidlaw Campaigns did not respond to Guardian Australia. One of Sky’s most senior reporters took a different tack. Political editor Andrew Clennell got hold of a voice mail from 2019, lodged as part of a formal complaint to the Liberal party, in which Dai Le claimed to “control” the Cabramatta branch of the Liberal party, despite being expelled from the party in 2019. After Le denied saying such things, Clennell played it on air. There is also footage of Le at a branch meeting in 2019 where a brawl erupted over memberships, along with her husband Marcus Lambert, who remains an official in the local Liberal branch. Outside the St John’s Park prepoll station, Le insisted to the Guardian that she was a genuine independent. “I was expelled in 2016 for 10 years,” she said. She denied any Liberal party support saying she had mortgaged her house to run and provide “true local representation”. Le denied any knowledge of the poll or Laidlaw Campaigns. There was clearly a wave of support for Le among the predominantly Vietnamese Australians voting at the St John’s Park prepoll. Le and her supporters were greeted warmly and many took only her how-to-vote card. Those that took Keneally’s how-to-vote were loudly reminded by Le’s offsider, the Fairfield mayor Frank Carbone: “You know she’s from the northern beaches.” A poster war has also erupted in Fowler, with Le’s campaign running posters featuring Keneally sandwiched between disgraced former Labor politicians, Eddie Obeid and Joe Tripodi, both of whom were found to have engaged in corrupt conduct by the NSW integrity body, Icac. A counterpunch poster campaign features Le standing next to Scott Morrison and querying whether she is independent. Whether Le can pull off her challenge remains to be seen. The Laidlaw poll, according to Morrow, has it going down to the wire. Keneally, however, seems relaxed. “Fowler’s just so warm and welcoming. People are excited about a change of government,” she says. “They are voting Labor. “In south-west Sydney, the unemployment rate is double the national average and the cost of housing is the same. Housing overcrowding is a major issue: there are grandparents, parents and children living in the one house, so the help-to-buy plan really matters in south-west Sydney.” Immigration is also a big issue in the heavily multicultural seat and Keneally is happy to remind voters that she’s likely to be minister for home affairs in a Labor government.",News/Australia news,Safe federal seat of Fowler turned battleground: Kristina Keneally and the mystery polling,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/safe-federal-seat-of-fowler-turned-battleground-kristina-keneally-and-the-mystery-polling
5/20/2022,"Australians head to the polls on Saturday with the opposition Labor party, led by Anthony Albanese, hoping to end nine years of conservative rule. The Liberal-National coalition government, headed by Scott Morrison, goes into the election with 75 MPs in the 151-seat House of Representatives, one short of the majority needed to govern without crossbench support. Labor has been ahead in opinion polls since the campaign began, but the lead has narrowed in the final week of the campaign, and the party is haunted by its failure at the last election, in 2019, when the polls wrongly suggested it would win. The six-week election campaign has largely been an attritional slog between two uninspiring leaders, but enlivened by high-profile independent candidates and minor parties challenging the offerings of the government and opposition. Morrison’s Liberal party has come under pressure in formerly safe inner-city seats, which have been targeted by grassroots campaigns backed by millions of dollars in donations from the lobby group Climate 200 and supporting, almost exclusively, female candidates. The independents are running on a platform of stronger action to address the climate crisis, establishing a national anti-corruption body and addressing gender inequality, all areas where Morrison’s government is seen as weak. Despite the push by the independents and the Greens to put global heating on the agenda, neither major party has committed to strong climate action. The coalition committed, after much reluctance from the rural-based National party, to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, but includes new gas projects in its technology-led recovery. Three weeks into the campaign a Nationals senator, Matt Canavan, declared the net zero ambition “all over bar the shouting”. Labor presented a modest plan hinged on building more efficient transmission lines and reducing industrial emissions, which has been supported by the business lobby as at least representing some steps towards a credible policy. Among the seats targeted by independent campaigns is Kooyong, the inner-city Melbourne seat held by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg. Government MPs in target areas, including Frydenberg, have attempted to distance themselves from the unpopular Morrison and instead called in the conservative former prime minister John Howard to campaign extensively in an attempt to keep their seats. If even a few independent candidates are successful it could result in a hung parliament, the first since 2010. In the upper house, where minor parties have a better chance of election and overall majorities are rare, the Greens hope to gain three seats, which would bring the party’s Senate team to 12. Morrison has focused his campaign on electorates in the outer suburbs and regional cities that have traditionally been held by Labor, in what has been described as an emulation of the “red wall” strategy employed by Boris Johnson in the 2019 UK election. He has shaped his pitch for re-election on the government’s record in getting Australia through the Covid-19 pandemic with the economy intact and without significant loss of life in the first two years. This year, however, Australia has experienced one of the highest Covid transmission rates per capita in the world, with 5,633 deaths since the start of 2022, compared with 2,239 in 2020 and 2021 combined. Morrison said in the last week of the campaign that there was no need for further public health measures to reverse this trend. Morrison promised to change the way he governed if re-elected, admitting to being “a bit of a bulldozer”. Albanese has campaigned largely on the platform of not being Scott Morrison. “This government has been there for almost a decade, this prime minister had four years in office, and what he’s saying is ‘if you vote for Scott Morrison, I’ll change’ … well, if you want change, change the government,” Albanese said. The Labor leader, who was the manager of government business in the 2010-13 parliament, the most legislatively productive in Australia’s history despite Labor having no majority, said he was a “builder” to Morrison’s bulldozer. “A bulldozer wrecks things. A bulldozer knocks things over. I’m a builder, that’s what I am. I will build things in this country,” he said. Albanese suffered early from repeated gaffes, including his failure to name the cash rate (the central bank interest rate) or the employment rate on the opening day of the campaign, leading to repeated criticism from Morrison and the Murdoch press, particularly Sky News, that he was not across policy detail. He contracted Covid two weeks into the campaign and spent a week in isolation. Both major parties have focused on the cost of living, as Australia faces a housing affordability crisis, the first rise in the cash rate since 2010, and wages growing at half the inflation rate. Labor has promised to support wage increases for low-paid workers, address the gender wage gap, boost manufacturing, and introduce a $392m housing equity scheme that would allow the government to provide a contribution of up to 40% of the purchase price of a new home. Albanese said he would support a minimum wage increase of 5.1%, in line with inflation, which would amount to about $1 an hour for workers on the minimum wage. Morrison called that “incredibly reckless” and said such a rise “would force small businesses potentially out of business all together”. “Anthony Albanese is a loose unit on the economy,” Morrison said. The coalition then announced its own plan to address the extreme housing affordability crisis, which would allow Australians to access their superannuation to buy their first home, a move experts say would increase house prices and shrink the retirement savings of millions of Australians. Neither party has backed an increase in Australia’s unemployment benefits, which are below the poverty line, and they remain in lockstep on Australia’s hardline policies on asylum seekers.",News/Australia news,Australian election: voters to go to polls in battle of ‘bulldozer’ and ‘builder’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/australian-election-voters-polls-scott-morrison-bulldozer-anthony-albanese-builder
5/20/2022,"One of Melbourne’s Aboriginal heritage councils is facing a race against the clock, in a bid to stop two culturally significant artworks being lost to Australia when they go under the hammer at Sotheby’s New York auction house next week. The two works – an earth pigment and charcoal on paper painting, and a carved hardwood parrying shield – were created by William Barak, a pivotal Wurundjeri ngurungaeta (leader), negotiator and artist in the mid to late 1800s. The Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Cultural Heritage Corporation has launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to buy the works at auction and return them to Australia, having only learned of the artefacts’ impending auction in late April. The auction is scheduled for 25 May. A Wurundjeri elder and Barak descendent, Uncle Ron Jones, told Guardian Australia that the works should be classified as national treasures. “Whether the government’s Liberal or Labor, state or federal, it should be governments’ responsibility, [these works] are part of our history and should be protected,” he said. “We were wholly impacted [by colonisation] in virtually a similar way Tasmania was devastated. Let’s try and preserve some of our history and bring it back home.” The 1897 painting titled Corroboree (Women in possum skin cloaks), has an estimated value of about A$500,000 according to the Sotheby’s online catalogue, while the shield has an estimate of about $35,000. However, the Wurundjeri Corporation chief executive, Gwyneth Elsum said it had been advised as much as $1m might need to be raised to secure successful bids at auction. “We don’t know exactly how much they will both go for, so we’ve just put in our estimate,” she said. “As we get closer to the auction, we will have a better sense of what they’ll actually go for.” Elsum said the corporation wrote to Victoria’s Aboriginal affairs minister, Gabrielle Williams, on 22 April, seeking a meeting to discuss how the state government could assist in bringing the artworks home. A meeting has not been set. In a statement, a spokesperson for the minister said that, under the Aboriginal Heritage Act, Victoria is only responsible for the repatriation of ancestral remains and sacred objects to their rightful owners within the state. “The commonwealth government has responsibility for the protection and repatriation of significant cultural objects from overseas as part of the national heritage of all Australians,” the spokesperson said. Barak is one of the Wurundjeri clan’s most revered historical figures and a key player in negotiations between Indigenous Australians and Europeans in and around Melbourne (Narrm) in the 19th century. As a teenager, he witnessed the meeting between his father, uncles and other Wurundjeri elders that resulted in John Batman acquiring much of the land that became the cities of Melbourne and Geelong. Barak spent much of his life peacefully fighting against this dispossession, employing written petitions, diplomacy and negotiating skills. Th La Trobe University lecturer Nikita Vanderbyl, who completed her PhD thesis on Barak, said the two works were either bought by the Swiss grazier and agriculturalist Baron Frédéric Guillaume de Pury, or offered to the de Pury family by Barak as a gift or form of cultural exchange. The de Pury family had extensive land holdings in the Coranderrk region, where the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung people, part of the larger Kulin nation, had relocated following European encroachment. “The way I would describe the friendship is that it emerged out of almost necessity, because during this period of colonisation nothing was really fixed,” she said. “Barak was bringing his family into [de Pury’s] world as much as they were bringing him into theirs … he was using this friendship as a way to maintain contact with his country. There are strong indications that that friendship resulted in other artworks that are now in the de Pury’s Swiss collection at Neuchatel.” The Australian arm of the de Pury family donated its extensive Barak archives to the Yarra Ranges Regional Museum about a decade ago. Sandra de Pury, who still owns and operates the Yeringberg wine estate in the Yarra Valley her ancestors established, told the Guardian her family was not close to the European-based de Purys, and that they had not made contact about the Barak works. “We would love to see them come back to Australia, but short of donating to GoFundMe, which I fully intend to do, it’s a substantial amount of money,” de Pury said. Jones said his ancestor gave many paintings as gifts to people he respected. “The painting tells the story of his people, his culture and his history,” he said, of Corroboree. “He would have only given it to a special friend … as far as I’m concerned, that family has no right to make hundreds of thousands of dollars from something that was gifted to them.” It was only long after Barak’s death in 1903 that his artistic career was widely recognised. Much of his art now sits in museums and galleries across Australia. An exhibition commemorating his life was staged at the National Gallery of Victoria in 2003. Two years later, the William Barak bridge was constructed in Melbourne, and he was placed on the Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Roll in 2011. This is not the first time the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Cultural Heritage Corporation has resorted to crowdfunding in an attempt to repatriate a Barak work. In 2016, Bonhams sold his painting Ceremony for A$512,400. The corporation did not raise enough funds to outbid the successful buyer, an anonymous private collector. Its whereabouts are now unknown.",Arts/Art and design,‘Bring them home’: Australian crowdfund campaign seeks to buy Wurundjeri art at New York auction,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/20/bring-them-home-australian-crowdfund-campaign-seeks-to-buy-wurundjeri-art-at-new-york-auction
5/20/2022,"You don’t have to look far to find a frustrated Essendon fan in Melbourne/Narrm right now, myself included. Mention the club’s name at the pub and you’re bound to get a reception of either pity, frustration or anguish. Hyped before the season started, the men’s side have had a dismal run of 2022 so far and are now cemented in the bottom four on the ladder, having notched just two wins from nine games. Essendon greats are weighing in. Matthew Lloyd says “they are being walked all over” while Tim Watson claims the players are “on notice”. And it is looking like getting worse before it gets better as the Bombers face top eight opponents Richmond, Carlton and St Kilda in the coming weeks, and then a showdown with a dangerous-looking Port Adelaide currently placed 10th. In this sense, it is a trying time to wear the Dons scarf. Skipper Dyson Heppell confirmed on Monday night when fronting the media to say, “we absolutely [are] hurting inside and disappointed”. As a member, I can tell you the heartbreak and exasperation is real. It’s even now at the point where the ‘Essendon haven’t won a final in how many years?’ jokes from supporters of rival clubs have abated, as many look on with genuine sympathy for the red and black fanbase. However, when I think about Essendon, there is also excitement and hope in my chest. That’s why I dispute the AFL media’s chief correspondent Damian Barrett’s claim this week on AFL Daily that: “I’m not seeing anything positive out of this club at the moment”. Because for the many who have waited their entire lives to see a women’s team run out in the club’s famous red sash at the highest level, something positive is just mere months away from becoming a reality. Each week, news drops of the latest signings for the AFLW team the Bombers are building. It’s all looking very hopeful, as the club pinches fan favourites from rivals, such as Carlton’s Georgia Gee and Maddy Prespakis, Western Bulldog Bonnie Toogood, Fremantle’s Steph Cain and Collingwood’s Sophie Alexander. Adding to this optimism is the current Essendon VFLW team, who are already guaranteed a finals berth and currently sit undefeated at the top of the table with a mammoth percentage of 415.3. These Bombers have been winning games by around 40+ points each week – except for a recent tie with Hawthorn and another with St Kilda earlier in the season – and they thrashed Collingwood by 73 points in the Anzac Day round, the same weekend the men’s team lost by 11 points. Many of the players in this VFLW squad will be part of the Essendon AFLW team, including co-captain Georgia Nanscawen, Joanna Doonan, Danielle Marshall, Jordan Zanchetta and Federica Frew. It’s hard to watch “Freds” bag goal after goal on the weekend and not daydream about what that is going to look like at AFLW level. So it is a strange time to be an Essendon supporter. The heartbreak and disappointment tied to the men’s season mixes with the excitement and anticipation for the women’s team, who are looking like causing a real stir in the competition come August. Within my sports community, fans are every bit as invested in AFLW as much as AFLM. It means many are offering each other a shoulder after a 60-point loss to the men’s team on a Saturday night and then sharing a knowing nod on Sunday morning when the women’s team win by around the same margin. While Twitter is loudly asking, “What’s going on over at The Hangar?” and bemoaning the slump the men have found themselves in again, the same question is being asked about the women’s program, only with a polar opposite tone. This conflict of emotions tied to the same club is something my father can relate to. His Adelaide fandom has seen him sighing loudly watching the men’s team these last few years. And yet whenever he’s asked about the Crows, he proudly boasts they’ve won three out of the five AFLW premierships so far. My mum, a St George supporter in the NRL, has done the same, cheering for the Dragons’ NRLW side as the men in the Red V continue to disappoint, on and off field. I guess that’s what being a true supporter is all about: the highs and lows, even if they’re happening at the same time. So to any disheartened Bombers supporters who just want to see a convincing Essendon win, I recommend heading down to see the VFL women play. When it comes to the football club’s future, there’s something brilliant being built there.",Sport/Sport,These are strange times to follow Essendon but new AFLW team can buoy fans | Marnie Vinall,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/20/these-are-strange-times-to-follow-essendon-but-new-aflw-team-can-buoy-fans
5/20/2022,"Queenslander Jason Kubler is celebrating the perfect birthday present after completing his own personal grand slam. The one-time world No 1 junior, who has been beset by injury woes in the senior ranks, said it felt “unreal” to make the French Open main draw at Roland Garros, thus completing his set of playing in all four majors. On his 29th birthday, getting through the gruelling ordeal of the qualifying tournament on the red clay in Paris was another sign that the former wunderkind is enjoying a late-career renaissance. Kubler defeated Portugal’s Pedro Sousa 7-5, 6-2 in the third round and became the only Australian man to qualify this year. “Feels unreal. This was the last slam where I hadn’t played a main draw,” he said. “Luckily, I got a wildcard into Aussie, and then another into US and then I qualified for Wimby, so it’s nice to have qualified for another one. I guess just this year for me, in general, has been a pretty good one.” It started on a high when he reached the mixed doubles final at the Australian Open with Jaimee Fourlis and continued with a couple of victories in lower-level events in Canberra. He put the lucrative pay day from the Melbourne final to good use. “That really set me up for the year and I could start investing myself with coaching and some sort of support along the road,” he said. “Just the exact same thing with this tournament now, I can really start to plan things, have a lot more people around me. Always makes it a bit easier with all the travel and stuff like that. If anything, it’s just more money now that I can invest in myself.” Getting through to the first round of the main draw will guarantee Kubler at least 62,000 euros ($93,000) to further fund his revival. But he will have to wait until all the other qualifiers have been completed on Friday to learn who his first-round opponent will be. Potential nightmarish opponents first up for him in the draw could be luminaries like Alexander Zverev, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Carlos Alcaraz. “Obviously I’d love to win as many rounds as I could but, to be honest, I just want to play people where I learn things about myself,” he said. “If I play any of the big names, win or lose, I’m going to learn what I need to improve, learn what type of player I am, maybe experience some pretty cool moments.

It is not the economy nor the climate crisis, though these will no doubt matter to many other voters. Aircraft noise has become the defining local political issue for many of those who live under flightpaths since the day Brisbane airport opened its second runway in mid-2020. Anger among those affected is white-hot, well-organised and is leading some rusted-on voters from both major parties to switch their votes to the Greens. The minor party is promising a curfew and cap on flights, as well as changes to flightpaths which would send more planes over Moreton Bay. The LNP also announced it would “rip up and redraw” Brisbane’s flightpaths last month, although Brisbane Flight Path Community Alliance chair, David Diamond, said some held a “natural cynicism” about that promise, given that the government had been brought “kicking and screaming” to the position on the eve of the election. Labor says it will deliver a white paper to address aircraft noise and airport planning, a promise that has failed to salve the burning resentment some residents now hold against both parties. Diamond said some felt “misled” by the way the billion-dollar runway project had been managed. “So there’s an integrity issue now as well,” he said. An IT consultant and small businessman who lives in the riverside suburb of Bulimba in the electorate of Griffith, Alex Proctor, said he would normally be focused on the “big-hitter” issues of health, childcare, housing, education and the environment, and typically voted Labor. But the 43-year-old father of two said his fears of increased aircraft noise meant his “only choice” at this election was to vote Greens. “I’ve never voted Greens in my life,” he said. The LNP, too, seems destined to lose some voters, although toxic online debates mean many do not want to be publicly identified. One who lives in the neighbouring suburb of Balmoral said he was a rusted-on LNP supporter of 50 years. The man, who said he had done “pretty well” out of the resources industry, said the government had done a “reasonable job” nationally, and he didn’t trust Labor with the economy – the issue upon which he would normally vote. “There are a hell of a lot of people out there hurting physically and mentally who are afraid to speak up,” he said. “Voting for the Greens is a private protest of anonymity.” Both these voters live in Griffith, which is held by Labor’s Terri Butler on a margin of 2.9%. In 2019 the LNP’s Olivia Roberts won the highest number of first-preference votes, 40.97%, compared with Butler’s 30.95%, and came second after preferences were distributed. The Greens’ Max Chandler-Mather garnered a swing of 6.67% to win 23.65% last time and is hopeful of snatching the seat. Chandler-Mather has run what the party describes as its largest door-knocking and listening campaign yet. His team picked up on the “huge” significance of aircraft noise early last year. “I would say it’s probably one of, if not the biggest, local issue,” Chandler-Mather said. “In Griffith, it is not an overstatement to say there are thousands of new people voting for the Greens because of flight noise.” Questions to Butler were directed to Labor’s campaign headquarters. A Labor spokesperson accused the Greens of making “empty promises they know they will never have to deliver” and said the LNP had “only discovered noise is an issue 10 minutes before an election”. Roberts was also contacted for comment. The issue has also proved a flashpoint on the other side of the river in the seat of Brisbane, which is held by the LNP’s Trevor Evans on a margin of 4.9%. Brisbane is seen as a three-horse race, with the Greens candidate, Stephen Bates, likely to pick up protest votes because of the flightpath noise. Evans was contacted for comment and responded with a statement that said he talked with constituents affected by “excessive and unreasonable” aircraft noise “every day”, and that the government had “responded decisively to this problem”. Aircraft noise could also prove a factor in Ryan, held by the LNP on a margin of 6%. The Brisbane Airport Corporation said it did not support curfews but backed changing flightpaths over Moreton Bay. Susan Harris Rimmer, who teaches human rights and public policy at Griffith University, also lives in Griffith and said her letterbox was crammed with material about flight noise. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She agreed the issue would “play out best for the Greens” and acknowledged that the noise was distressing for those who lived where planes fly low. But Harris Rimmer said there was a bigger picture that was being lost in the debate, citing a Climate Council report which places both Brisbane and Griffith in the top 10 federal electorates most at risk from climate change by 2030. “If people think that their amenity is affected by [aircraft noise], just wait till they see how their amenity is affected by the climate impacts that are coming,” she said. “That is a serious issues for those suburbs, and who is talking about it?”",News/Australia news,Anger over aircraft noise expected to boost Greens’ election chances in Brisbane,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/anger-over-aircraft-noise-expected-to-boost-greens-election-chances-in-brisbane
5/20/2022,"The fashion designer Alexander McQueen once said: “If you want to know me, just look at my work.” Australians will soon have the opportunity to do just that, with a major exhibition exploring his designs and influences set to open at the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) in December. Sixty garments and accessories will travel from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (Lacma) to Melbourne for Alexander McQueen: Mind, Mythos, Muse, with another 50 designs coming from the NGV’s archive. Katie Somerville, the NGV’s senior curator of fashion and textiles, described the museum’s existing McQueen collection as “a real strength” – so much so, the NGV exhibition will be almost twice the size of what was shown in LA. The NGV first began procuring McQueen designs in 1995, just three years after he founded his eponymous label in London, and its collection also includes pieces from McQueen’s tenure at the French house Givenchy, where he worked between 1996 and 2001. Even after his death in 2010, the gallery has continued to acquire McQueen designs, with the fashion house currently headed by the creative director Sarah Burton. Clarissa Esguerra, the associate curator of costume and textiles at Lacma, said it was an exciting moment “when we first began discussions with our colleagues at the NGV and realised they have donors like ours and could expand the show and make it something really special”. McQueen was known for his intensely dramatic runway shows, often as grotesque as they were beautiful, and for his designs that incorporated natural history, mythology, sex, death and violence. The upcoming exhibition will juxtapose his designs with more than 70 historical artworks from the artistic movements that inspired him. “We can’t know every time if [McQueen] was inspired by the exact works” in the show, Esguerra acknowledged, but said the curators hoped to create “more of a conversation” around his influences. The exhibition will be divided into four themes – mythos, fashioned narratives, evolution and existence, and technical innovation – that reflect who McQueen was as a designer: equal parts creative genius and enfant terrible. McQueen began his career as a student of tailors on Savile Row, where he honed his immense technical skills. At age 20 he moved to Milan, with no money or ability to speak Italian, and apprenticed for Romeo Gigli, before returning to London to attend Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design. He rapidly became one of Britain’s most famous designers, before he killed himself at the age of 40 in 2010, the day before the funeral of his mother, Joyce. His last complete collection, Plato’s Atlantis, was presented at Paris Fashion Week in 2009. McQueen was fascinated by the power of narratives, said Michaela Hansen, the curatorial assistant in costume and textiles at Lacma. This saw him tackle controversial themes and ideas like his fourth runway show, titled Highland Rape Autumn Winter 1995. Intended as a commentary on colonialism and the Highland clearances of Scotland, reviewers criticised his decision to send models down the runway in ripped and bloody clothing as misogynistic. Several pieces from this collection will be displayed at the NGV. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The accusations of misogyny were a misreading of McQueen, Somerville said, adding that he championed women and made them the centre of his personal life and creative world. One was the socialite Isabella Blow, who became his muse and a patron upon seeing his graduate collection from Central Saint Martins and buying every piece. Garments originally owned by Blow and fellow muse Annabelle Neilson will also be on display at the NGV. Somerville credited McQueen as being “able to break rules and fuel your imagination”, and said the NGV exhibition would be “full of challenge and delight and beauty … [a] wonderful opportunity for our audiences to consider his work”.

5/20/2022,"Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the Donbas, where Russia is now concentrating its main effort, has been “completely destroyed”. “There’s hell, and that’s not an exaggeration,” he said in his nightly address. “The bombing and shelling of other cities, the air and missile strikes of the Russian army – all this is not just hostilities during the war.” Russia’s foreign ministry said it would consider opening access to Ukraine’s Black Sea ports only if the removal of sanctions against Russia was also considered. The remarks of the Russian deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, came after the UN food chief, David Beasley, pleaded with president Vladimir Putin, saying millions would die around the world because of the Russian blockade of the ports. The US Congress has approved $40bn in military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, with both parties eagerly backing the latest effort to support an ally under Russian assault. Final passage came as Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, said the US had authorised shipping Ukraine another $100m worth of weapons and equipment from Pentagon stocks. Mykhailo Podolyak, Ukraine’s top presidential adviser and a member of the negotiating team, said a ceasefire with Russia was “impossible without total Russian troops withdrawal”. Podolyak said Kyiv was not interested in a new “Minsk”, referring to the 2015 Minsk agreement, brokered by France and Germany, which attempted to secure a ceasefire between the Ukrainian government and Russia-backed separatists in the east of Ukraine. Russia has said a further 771 Ukrainian troops have “surrendered” at Mariupol’s besieged Azovstal steelworks, bringing the total number to 1,730 this week, while the International Committee of the Red Cross said it had started registering the Ukrainian prisoners of war who left the plant. It is not clear how many remain at the plant. Putin’s youngest daughter, Katerina Tikhonova, flew to Munich, Germany, “more than 50 times” between 2017 and 2019, travelling on chartered flights with full state support, according to an investigation by Germany’s Spiegel magazine and independent Russian media outlet iStories. Her enthusiasm for Europe appears to match that of the oligarch “scum and traitors” Putin has decried since the start of the war. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old tank commander, asked a Ukrainian widow to forgive him for the murder of her husband after pleading guilty on Wednesday to killing an unarmed 62-year-old civilian in the north-east Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka on 28 February. Russia’s promise to use lasers to shoot down drones in Ukraine has prompted widespread scepticism that the novel and possibly nuclear-powered weaponry could be deployed on the battlefield or have any significant impact on the war. Zelenskiy described it as a “wunderwaffe” – a nonexistent “wonder weapon” that was originally a propaganda invention of the Nazis. The US president, Joe Biden, said Finland and Sweden “meet every Nato requirement and then some” to join the alliance and have the “full, complete backing” of the US. Speaking at a joint press conference at the White House with Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, and Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, he also said he was confident Turkey’s concerns regarding their membership could be addressed. The former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder will lose some of his post-office privileges after failing to cut his links with Russian energy companies over the Ukraine war, the Bundestag’s budgetary committee has decided. Schröder – chancellor from 1998 to 2005 – will be stripped of his office and staff, which cost about €419,000 ($443,000) in taxpayers’ money in 2021. G7 financial leaders have agreed on $18.4bn aid to help Ukraine and said they were ready to stand by Kyiv and “do more as needed”, according to a draft communique seen by Reuters. Finance ministers and central bank governors of the US, Japan, Canada, Britain, Germany, France and Italy are holding talks as Ukraine is running out of cash. McDonald’s has reached a deal to sell all its restaurants in Russia to one of its licensees in the country, the businessman Alexander Govor, who will operate them under a new name. More than a million Ukrainian refugees have already returned home, according to the country’s ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko.

5/20/2022,"The major parties are often dismissed as being too similar, but if you’re wondering how to decide who to vote for in the 2022 Australian election, here are seven key issues where there are real policy differences between the two major political parties in Australia. Labor has promised registered nurses will be on site 24/7 in every residential aged care facility in the country. It will also mandate that every resident receives an average of 215 minutes of care per day, as recommended by the damning aged care royal commission. Labor has also pledged to back aged care workers’ case for a 25% pay rise in the Fair Work Commission and has promised to fund the outcome of the case. It has promised to improve the food delivered to residents of aged care facilities by developing and implementing mandatory nutrition standards, and will push for greater transparency and accountability in the sector by making providers report publicly what they are spending government money on. Since the royal commission, the Coalition has announced a five-year $19.1bn aged care plan, which includes a major boost to home care of 40,000 new home care packages. The package also includes a boost to respite services, 7,000 new personal care workers, and 48,000 new training places. Like Labor, it has pledged to support aged care workers in their bid for higher pay, but has stopped short of committing to fund the pay rise. The Coalition is also delivering bonuses of up to $800 for aged care staff and is spending $345m to embed pharmacy services in aged care facilities. The Coalition has already broken a 2019 promise to establish a federal anti-corruption commission. The model it proposed was widely condemned as weak, toothless and an effective shield for politicians. It allows no public hearings for government corruption, cannot take public tip-offs, has a widely criticised definition of corruption, is not retrospective, and cannot make findings of corruption. It requires suspicion that a criminal offence has occurred before commencing an investigation, a threshold which critics say is hugely prohibitive. The Coalition released an exposure draft but never tabled its legislation in parliament, blaming a lack of support from Labor. Labor, meanwhile, has promised to establish an integrity commission by the end of the year. It has not released a detailed blueprint of how its model would work, but its two-page statement of principles indicates it would have the “independence, resources and powers of a standing royal commission”. Labor’s model would be able to hold public hearings, take public tip-offs, investigate MPs and ministers with broad discretion, act retrospectively, and make findings of corruption. The Coalition’s childcare policy leans primarily on past action. In the 2021 budget, the government increased the subsidy for the second and subsequent children in care, and removed the annual cap that limited the subsidy a family earning over $190,000 could receive. These restrictions had acted as a disincentive for many women to return to work. The changes took effect in March this year. Analysts say the changes reduce, but don’t remove, those workforce disincentives. Labor’s policy goes further, increasing the maximum subsidies for the first and subsequent children in care and softening the income taper so households can earn more while receiving higher subsidies. The party also pledges to get the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to work out a way to regulate childcare prices, and the Productivity Commission to review the sector “with the aim of implementing a universal 90% subsidy for all families”. According to Grattan Institute analysis, the high cost to the commonwealth for the Labor scheme would likely be more than offset by the broadly increased workforce participation. Despite significant pressure, the Coalition has not increased the 2030 emissions reduction target (26-28% compared with 2005 levels) it set in 2015. It opposes requiring anyone to cut emissions. Instead, it says it will spend $22bn on low-emissions technology by 2030, focusing on six priority areas. More than half this funding just tops up the budgets of existing clean energy agencies. Budget papers suggested the annual allocation of climate spending is expected to decrease over the next four years and the $22bn includes support for gas, a fossil fuel. The Coalition has promised to reach net zero emissions by 2050, but the plan does not explain how the goal will be reached. It assumes new technology will become commercial at some point after 2030 and be adopted. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor has a 2030 plan and a more ambitious emissions target for that date – a 43% cut. Scientists say it is significantly better than the Coalition, but less than what is needed. The ALP says it would create a $20bn “rewiring the nation corporation” to accelerate the roll out of major transmission links – poles and wires, in simple terms – to connect new solar and wind farms and batteries to the grid. Its modelling suggests 82% of grid electricity would be from renewables by 2030. It is promising to work with industry to gradually reduce its emissions using an existing Coalition policy known as the safeguard mechanism. It says it would exempt electric vehicles from some taxes, spend more on EV charging stations than the Coalition and attempt to help build global action by bidding to co-host the annual UN climate summit with Pacific countries in 2024. Both parties would allow fossil fuel exports to continue while there is a market for Australian coal and gas. The Coalition left it until late in the campaign to drop its main housing policy, which appears to offer one of the bigger differences with Labor. Buyers would be able to tap their superannuation for as much as $50,000, or 40%, to assist with the purchase of a first home, provided they later repay their retirement fund. Over-55s would also be able to access a scheme now open to 65s-plus to tip as much as $600,000 into their super to encourage downsizing and add market supply.Critics, though, note younger buyers typically have little super and extra demand would nudge prices higher. Few people had taken up the downsizing plan that’s been in place since 2018. By contrast, Labor’s schemes are means-tested and include the “help to buy” plan that would see the government chip in as much as 40% of the price for a new home (30% for existing ones) for buyers with at least a 2% deposit. To the extent it pushes up prices, the policy has a sting, but with the program capped at 10,000 a year (compared with about 100,000 first homers entering the market) the issue may be its limited scope. A separate plan to create a $10bn Housing Australia Future Fund sounds grand but the 30,000 new social and affordable housing properties over five years is also modest. Senior Coalition MPs, including the prime minister, have said they do not support the key reform proposed in the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which is to enshrine a voice to parliament in the constitution. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, has been attempting to develop a consensus position that could be progressed toward referendum, but any deviation from enshrining a voice has been roundly criticised by those supportive of the Uluru statement. He’s also attempted to progress a version of the voice under ordinary legislation, which has also been criticised as not conforming to the central demands of the Uluru dialogues. There are some outliers within the party. Labor has committed to implement the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full, including progressing a referendum to enshrine a voice to parliament in the constitution. It has also committed to establishing a Makarrata Commission, which it says will develop a national framework for treaty-making and support and fund local truth-telling efforts, in partnership with First Nations groups and local communities. There isn’t a lot of detail around this model but it may look to Victoria’s Yoorrook Justice Commission. Few significant reforms to health have been announced by either of the major parties, despite rising out-of-pocket health costs and pressure on emergency services and hospitals. Anthony Albanese has said he is prepared to sit down and work “constructively” with state premiers on the need for more hospital funding, but has ruled out making any grand funding promises before the election. Labor will fund 50 bulk-billed urgent care clinics, but some experts say this is too few and a short-term fix to a struggling health system. Ahead of the final week of the election campaign, Labor revealed the most significant health commitment made by either party to date; promising a $970m investment in primary health and a boost for infrastructure upgrades in GP practices. The Coalition announced a package to boost regional, rural and remote health, since matched by the opposition. Both parties will reduce the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme co-payment to bring down the cost of medicines. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners president, Dr Karen Price, said until the opposition’s announcement, “we had not seen a commitment by either major party to meaningfully invest in general practice patient care”. But she said the Medicare rebate issue was still pressing. The health economist Prof Stephen Duckett said the health election policies of both parties had failed to mention “the elephant in the room – the continuing Covid pandemic”, saying funding for the pandemic’s ongoing impact was lacking.",News/Australia news,Who should I vote for?

5/20/2022,"While the main focus of the election campaign has been on the House of Representatives, the makeup of the new Senate will be crucial to the success of the next government. If Labor forms government it will be hoping for a more sympathetic Senate than the current numbers, which lean to the right. The Coalition and One Nation until recently held half the 76 Senate seats between them. Three seats are held by Jacqui Lambie, Rex Patrick and Stirling Griff, with the remaining 35 held by Labor or the Greens. Each state has 12 senators but at most federal polls, including this one, only half are up for election (as well as two from each of the territories). The voting system means the six places on offer almost always split as three for parties of the left and three for parties of the right – although a few senators and candidates defy a simple left-right classification. It’s typically very difficult for the left or right to win four out of six, so when a 4-2 split is achieved, that makes a big difference to the balance of the Senate. The left currently holds just four out of 12 senators in Queensland, and the Greens have a good chance of gaining a seat from the right. There is also a good chance for the Greens to gain a seat from one of the independents in South Australia. Gains for the left beyond those two are harder to see, but if Labor has a very good night, they could create a 4-2 split in Western Australia or Tasmania. The Coalition is defending three seats in most states, and in many of those states that third seat is vulnerable; either to Labor, the Greens or a rightwing minor party. Three Coalition, two Labor and one Greens were elected in 2019. Labor is defending three seats, but it seems highly likely they will lose their third to the Greens. The Coalition vote seems to be holding up reasonably well, but if the Liberal/National vote drops far enough they could lose a seat to One Nation or the United Australia party. Whatever the result, this state will return another 3-3 split, which won’t shift the midpoint of the Senate. Victoria elected three Coalition senators in 2019, alongside two Labor and one Greens, and the parties are defending the same number of seats in 2022. It seems most likely that this split will be maintained. Labor appears to be making relatively modest gains in Victoria, so there is little prospect of gaining a seat from the right. But if the Coalition’s vote drops significantly it might endanger their third seat, which could be won by a minor rightwing party or an independent such as Derryn Hinch. The Liberal National party is defending three seats, alongside One Nation’s Pauline Hanson and two Labor senators. The vote for both Labor and the Greens appears to be up significantly in Queensland, which would mean there is a good chance of electing three senators from the left: two Labor and one Greens. In that case there would be only three seats left in play for the right. The LNP should retain their first two seats, but a swing against the party will make it hard for them to defend their third candidate, Amanda Stoker. Hanson is the favourite to take that seat, but is also being challenged by the UAP founder, Clive Palmer, and the former Queensland premier Campbell Newman, running for the Liberal Democrats. Western Australia elected three Liberals, two Labor and one Green in 2019, and the senators up for election have the same split. There is some polling evidence that suggests a large swing from the Liberals to Labor, which opens up the possibility of Labor gaining a third seat without defeating the Greens senator, producing a 4-2 split in favour of the left. South Australia elected three Liberals, two Labor and one Green in 2019, but the cohort up for election in 2022 are quite different. It includes Stirling Griff and Rex Patrick, who both hold seats originally won by the Nick Xenophon Team in 2016. Xenophon himself is running again and would be a good chance to regain his seat. It seems unlikely his ticket can retain both of those seats, freeing up one seat for another party. Even if Labor is on track to win the election, it seems more likely the Greens will gain the other seat, producing a 3-2-1 split in favour of the left. Jacqui Lambie regained her seat at the 2019 election, alongside two Liberals, two Labor and one Green. This year’s cohort up for election are three Liberals, two Labor and one Greens. The Jacqui Lambie Network candidate, Tammy Tyrrell, appears to have a real chance of defeating the third Liberal candidate, Eric Abetz. It’s also possible that Labor could win a third seat from the Liberals, as happened in 2007 and 2010. The Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory each have two senators, who serve a three year term. Labor and the Coalition have split each territory 1-1 at every election since these seats were created. There is no prospect of a change in the Northern Territory, where the Country Liberal party will regain the seat they lost when CLP senator Sam McMahon left the party earlier this year. A number of independents are challenging the minister Zed Seselja for his Senate seat, with polls suggesting former Wallaby David Pocock, backed by the Climate 200 group, is the leading challenger. Pocock seems to have a real shot at winning – to pull it off, he needs to enough Labor and Greens voters, and a few Liberals, to give him their first preference.",News/Australia news,Federal election 2022: what are the chances for each party in the Senate and who will win?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/federal-election-2022-senate-parties-who-will-win-prediction-cross-bench-labor-coalition-greens-independents
5/20/2022,"Frank Lampard described Everton’s dramatic Premier League survival as the one of the greatest moments of his career after Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s 85th minute winner completed a stunning comeback against Crystal Palace. Everton trailed Patrick Vieira’s team 2-0 at half-time and looked destined for a fraught relegation fight at Arsenal on the final day. But a stirring second-half recovery, capped by the England international’s late diving header, preserved the club’s 68-year top-flight residence in remarkable style. The victory sparked a huge pitch invasion at Goodison Park. The celebrations were largely peaceful, certainly in comparison to the ugly scenes at Nottingham Forest and Port Vale, but Vieira appeared to kick out at an Everton fan who goaded him after the final whistle. The Palace manager declined to comment on the incident afterwards. Lampard, however, ended the night celebrating in front of jubilant Evertonians while stood on the roof of an executive box. “It is one of the greatest moments of my footballing life and career,” the Everton manager said. “I have been very fortunate to have amazing times, especially at Chelsea as a player and a coach. But when you feel the feelings and desperation of what relegation brings to the table, it is different. You need to dig in. You lose games, you fight to do something and then you lose another game. People think you should fly up the table and it is never that way. “Coming in here three and a half months ago with my amazing staff, positive people who work so hard, and trying to affect things and getting a reaction from the players, from the fans and feeling unity when it looked split. This club is special and I am proud to be manager of Everton on this night. “I am full of thanks tonight; thanks to the fans for taking me on board, to the board for taking me on at a difficult time when we appeared to be going in the wrong direction, and to the players. That was down to the players.” Lampard’s half-time introduction of Dele Alli helped turn the game in Everton’s favour. The nature of the comeback, and the stakes involved, produced an emotional outpouring on the final whistle. The Everton manager added: “I thought I might cry [at full time], I thought I might jump out of my body. Nobody can question the celebrations at the end. “It is easy to say: ‘But you haven’t won anything.’ You know what, come and work at this club for a few months and see the difficulties and what it means to people to stay in this league. “See us 2-0 down at half-time, playing poorly, ridiculous second goal and then see the character they showed. See the fans on the pitch in good heart and spirit. They have pulled us over the line, they have been more than a 12th man. “But the players also deserve huge credit. An amazing night. Dele was brilliant when he came on. He changed the game individually. We had already changed the system but it was to give a little bit of information. “It was nothing to do with a system change to change the game, it was always going to be the players, their character and desire to engage the crowd and make something happen. “I can’t take too much credit. I didn’t come up with some new magical tactics. We went direct, but no problem in this position. But we relied on the players.” On the pitch invasion itself Lampard said: “It was pure elation of fans who have come on the pitch after avoiding relegation. If it is done in the right way let them stay on the pitch, let them have their moment. As long as they behave, no problem.” Vieira was deeply unhappy with Palace’s second half display, their having silenced the Goodison crowd to lead through Jean-Philippe Mateta and Jordan Ayew after 45 minutes. “All that changed was that we didn’t respect the game as well as we did in the first half,” the Palace manager said. “We were inviting too much pressure and we didn’t move the ball quick enough and allowed them to build that momentum and confidence. It is about managing the game when winning 2-0 and we didn’t do that well enough in the second half. We gave them hope and when we invited pressure they scored one goal, two goals, three goals – when we conceded that first goal it made it difficult for us.”",Sport/Football,‘One of the greatest moments of my life’: Lampard revels in Everton survival,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/20/one-of-the-greatest-moments-of-my-life-lampard-revels-in-everton-survival
5/20/2022,"Hundreds of thousands of people struggling to sleep are to be offered treatment via an app instead of sleeping pills in the biggest shake-up of guidelines for insomnia in decades. Until now, people with insomnia have typically been given advice about sleep hygiene or prescribed sleeping pills. Now they could be offered a £45 app-based treatment programme on the NHS instead of pills, under new guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice). Nice is recommending Sleepio as an effective alternative for the first time, saving the NHS cash and reducing prescriptions of drugs which can be addictive. An analysis found healthcare costs were lower when using Sleepio, mostly because of fewer GP appointments and sleeping pills prescribed, Nice said. The app uses an artificial intelligence algorithm to provide people with tailored digital cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). As many as 800,000 people could benefit from the new guidelines in England. “Until now people with insomnia have been offered sleeping pills and taught about sleep hygiene, so our committee’s recommendation of Sleepio provides GPs and their patients with a new treatment option,” said Jeanette Kusel, the acting director for MedTech and digital at Nice. “Our rigorous, transparent and evidence-based analysis has found that Sleepio is cost saving for the NHS compared with usual treatments in primary care. It will also reduce people with insomnia’s reliance on dependence-forming drugs such as zolpidem and zopiclone. “This is a good example of where a digital health technology can help the NHS. The evidence has shown using Sleepio reduces the number of GP appointments people with insomnia need and will also cut the number of prescriptions for sleeping pills delivered by pharmacists.” The app offers a digital six-week self-help programme involving a sleep test, weekly interactive CBT-I sessions and keeping a diary about their sleeping patterns. The sessions focus on identifying thoughts, feelings and behaviours that contribute to the symptoms of insomnia. Cognitive interventions aim to improve how a patient thinks about sleep, and behavioural interventions aim to promote a healthy sleep routine. The programme is designed to be completed in six weeks, but under the new guidelines people will have full access to it for 12 months from registration. This will allow NHS patients to complete the sessions at their own pace and revisit sessions, Nice said. Participants can also access electronic library articles, online tools and join the online Sleepio user community for support. A daily sleep diary helps users track their progress and the programme tailors advice to individuals. Users can fill in the diary manually or the data can be automatically uploaded from a compatible wearable tracking device, like an Apple watch or Fitbit. Clinical evidence presented to Nice’s medical technologies advisory committee from 12 randomised controlled trials showed that Sleepio is more effective at reducing insomnia than sleep hygiene and sleeping pills. The cost of Sleepio is £45 per person and will also save the NHS money, Nice said. This is based on an analysis of primary care resource use data before and after Sleepio was introduced in nine GP practices.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Insomniacs in England to be offered app treatment instead of sleeping pills ,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/20/insomniacs-in-england-to-be-offered-app-treatment-instead-of-sleeping-pills
5/20/2022,"Consumer confidence in the UK has fallen to the lowest level since records began in 1974 amid growing concern over the cost of living crisis. Stoking fears that Britain is heading for a recession caused by the squeeze on family budgets, the latest monthly snapshot showed consumers are now gloomier about their prospects than they were during the 2008 financial crisis. Almost all confidence measures tracked by the polling firm GfK fell in May, continuing a steep decline from April when households were hit by record increases in energy bills after the rise in the Ofgem price cap. The headline UK consumer confidence index, a measure of how people view their personal finances and the wider economic outlook, dropped by two percentage points to -40 in May, surpassing the previous record low of -39 set in July 2008 when the global banking system was imploding. Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, said: “This means consumer confidence is now weaker than in the darkest days of the global banking crisis, the impact of Brexit on the economy, or the Covid shutdown.” Economists warned in April when the index dropped to -38 that such a low reading was consistent with Britain’s economy falling into recession, because it had closely tracked UK GDP over the past five decades. “That correlation has been robust to many economic regimes and shocks, from 1970s stagflation to the great moderation and the financial crisis,” said Robert Wood, UK economist at the Bank of America. “Consumer confidence matters because it gives an early, reliable, signal.” UK inflation rose to 9% in April, the highest level since the early 1980s, as hard-pressed families come under mounting pressure from soaring energy bills, record petrol prices and the rising cost of the weekly shop. It comes as the impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine ripples through global oil and gas markets, exacerbating a post-lockdown surge in prices. Economists expect the historic hit to living standards to lead to consumers tightening their belts as soaring prices for essentials such as food, fuel and energy force them to cut back on other purchases. Official figures show retail sales fell by more than expected in March, while industry data suggests the spending slump continued in April as households grappled with the record 54% rise in gas and electricity bills. The Bank of England warned earlier this month that Britain’s economy runs a heightened risk of recession as inflation heads towards 10%. GfK said its index measure based on asking consumers about their plans for big-ticket purchases had decreased for each of the past six months. Consumer pessimism was most evident in people’s views on the general economy, with an index score of -63 for the past year and -56 for the coming year. Figures from the Office for National Statistics published on Thursday showed a six percentage point weekly fall in UK credit and debit card spending last week, as well as a 10 point drop in the number of seated diners in restaurants. However, the figures come after the early May bank holiday weekend, when sales rose sharply. The ONS said the rising cost of materials and energy were the top concern for UK companies. As many as 26% of businesses said rising costs were their main concern this month, up from 24% in April 2022, followed by 20% who said soaring energy prices were the biggest worry. Joe Staton, from GfK, added: “Even the Bank of England is pessimistic, with governor Andrew Bailey this week offering no hope of tackling inflation. The outlook for consumer confidence is gloomy, and nothing on the economic horizon shows a reason for optimism any time soon.”",News/Business,UK consumer confidence falls to lowest level since 1974,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/20/uk-consumer-confidence-falls-to-lowest-level-since-1974
5/20/2022,"Eligibility for telephone voting will be expanded to allow Covid-positive Australians to vote in Saturday’s election. On Thursday the Australian Electoral Commission admitted that more than 100,000 people had been caught by an anomaly that could have prevented them voting: they tested positive after the cutoff to apply for a postal ballot but too soon to qualify for telephone voting. But on Friday morning the AEC said it had recommended problem be fixed to allow anyone who tested positive after 6pm last Friday to use telephone voting. The fix follows strong criticism from Australians prevented from having their say in the election and a legal threat from the independent candidate for Kooyong, Monique Ryan. Ryan, who is challenging the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, had announced she would bring an urgent federal court case against the special minister of state, Ben Morton, to fix the issue. Scott Morrison confirmed eligibility had been expanded to prevent disenfranchisement of Covid-positive people. Asked on Friday if he agreed all Australians should be able to vote, Morrison told 6PR Radio: “Yeah I do.” “What we’ve been waiting on is for the electoral commissioner, the special minister of state he’s been working with the commissioner in recent days, and we’ve been waiting for [his] advice on how he believes this can be fixed,” he said. “We’ve received that advice now, and they’ll be expanding eligibility to people who tested positive after 6pm last Friday, that’s the recommendation of the electoral commissioner. “He’s worked through the logistics of all of that, what that means, on the call centres and all of those sorts of things, the practical issues that he has to be satisfied of.” The government is now consulting with the opposition to get bipartisan approval to make new regulations expanding the eligibility for telephone voting. Morton said the government had “immediately acted on advice provided by the AEC this morning”. “Any voter who has tested positive for Covid-19 after 6pm Friday 13th May will be able to access the secure telephone voting service,” he said. “It is important that every Australian who is enrolled and entitled to vote, be able to exercise their democratic right and this change ensures that.” Earlier Morrison said: “We want to make sure Australians have as much opportunity as they should in a democracy to vote.” He told ABC News Breakfast: “We will take [the commissioner’s] advice. It is not something for politicians to interfere in. We have an independent process, but we are ensuring the commissioner has every support that he can conduct the election in the best possible way.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Australian electoral commissioner, Tom Rogers, said: “The telephone voting service was legislated by Parliament as an emergency measure for individuals who had no other voting option once postal vote applications closed at 6pm on Wednesday.” Rogers said the AEC “cannot change the eligibility criteria but have certainly heard the concerns expressed by members of the public who tested positive to Covid-19 prior to 6pm on Tuesday and had not cast an early vote or applied for a postal vote”. “We have analysed the service’s take-up so far, our staffing levels and forecasts for use, and are in urgent discussions with Government about the concerns expressed by members of the public,” he said. “This morning I have signed a brief recommending for the eligibility for the service be expanded.”",News/Australia news,Telephone voting rules changed to allow Australians with Covid to vote in federal election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/telephone-voting-rules-changed-to-allow-australians-with-covid-to-vote-in-federal-election
5/20/2022,"Respiratory syncytial virus is killing 100,000 children under the age of five every year worldwide, new figures reveal as experts say the global easing of coronavirus restrictions is causing a surge in cases. RSV is the most common cause of acute lower respiratory infection in young children. It spreads easily via coughing and sneezing. There is no vaccine or specific treatment. RSV-attributable acute lower respiratory infections led to more than 100,000 deaths of children under five in 2019, according to figures published in the Lancet. Of those, more than 45,000 were under six months old, the first-of-its-kind study found. More children are likely to be affected by RSV in the future, experts believe, because masks and lockdowns have robbed children of natural immunity against a range of common viruses, including RSV. “RSV is the predominant cause of acute lower respiratory infection in young children and our updated estimates reveal that children six months and younger are particularly vulnerable, especially with cases surging as Covid-19 restrictions are easing around the world,” said the study’s co-author, Harish Nair of the University of Edinburgh. “The majority of the young children born in the last two years have never been exposed to RSV (and therefore have no immunity against this virus).” The figures in the Lancet include data from 113 studies. Around the globe in 2019, there were 33m RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infections in children aged under five, leading to 3.6m hospital admissions, 26,300 in-hospital deaths, and 101,400 RSV-attributable deaths. This accounts for about one in 50 – or 2% – of annual deaths from any cause in this age range. For infants under six months old, there were 6.6m RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection episodes globally in 2019. There were 1.4m hospital admissions, 13,300 hospital deaths, and 45,700 overall deaths attributable to RSV. Overall, 97% of RSV deaths in children under five occurred in low- and middle-income countries. Earlier this year a UK charity warned parents of young children to be on the alert for signs of RSV after a sharp rise in cases. The British Lung Foundation said an estimated 1,000 children had needed hospital care for the condition in England alone in just three months. In some cases, RSV can lead to bronchiolitis, an inflammatory infection that can make it hard to breathe. The early symptoms are similar to those of a common cold but can develop over a few days into a high temperature, a dry and persistent cough, difficulty feeding, and wheezing.",News/Society,"Respiratory syncytial virus kills 100,000 under-fives every year",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/19/respiratory-syncytial-virus-under-fives-respiratory-infection-covid
5/20/2022,"Canada says it will ban Huawei and ZTE from the country’s 5G network, a move that puts it in line with intelligence-sharing allies, but risks further chilling relations with China. The federal government made the announcement on Thursday afternoon after signalling for months it intended to block China’s flagship telecommunications companies from accessing 5G networks in Canada. “We’ll take any actions necessary to safeguard our telecommunications infrastructure,” said the innovation minister, François-Philippe Champagne. Telecoms providers who already have equipment from the firms must remove it – and Champagne said there would be no compensation provided by the federal government. Canadian telecom companies have spent nearly had C$700m (US$546m) on Huawei equipment over the years, largely on 4G or LTE equipment. The rest of the Five Eyes network – the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand – have already banned Huawei equipment. The public safety minister, Marco Mendicino, called the move a “necessary step” amid growing scepticism of Beijing’s trustworthiness. For years, Canada has faced growing pressure from allies, most notably the United States, to ban Huawei’s 5G equipment over fears it could compromise national security. In 2018, Canada said it would review any possible concerns posed by adopting the technology. But any decision was delayed after Huawei’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Canada on a US warrant. In a move widely seen as retaliatory, China arrested two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, later charging the men with espionage. The long-running dispute came to an end after a British Columbia court ordered Meng released. China freed the two Canadians hours later. As the standoff dragged on, relations between the two countries soured. While China recently lifted a ban on Canadian canola imports which had last for years, a sign of thawing relations, it is unclear how Thursday’s decision will affect ties between the two nations. Chinese government officials had previously warned a ban on telecoms infrastructure could prompt retaliatory measures.",News/World news,"Canada to ban Huawei and ZTE from 5G network, risking China tensions",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/canada-ban-huawei-zte-5g-network-china
5/20/2022,"Good morning. The federal election campaign finish line is approaching and the Australian Greens believe they are in a position to gain up to three seats in the Senate. Israel will not launch a criminal investigation into the killing of a US-Palestinian journalist. And Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers have ordered all female TV presenters to cover their faces on air. Australians go to the polls tomorrow but not everyone will be able to have their say due to an AEC anomaly preventing thousands of Covid-positive people from voting. A high-profile independent, Monique Ryan, who is running against the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, in Kooyong, is planning a federal court challenge over the issue. On the final day of the campaign, Labor is pledging to establish an independent environment protection agency to enforce national conservation laws and collect data on the plight of the country’s wildlife. Despite the independents taking media attention away from the Greens, the minor party is in a position to gain up to three seats in the Senate, with a potential, though unlikely, addition of another lower house seat in Brisbane. And the United Australia party may have more support than we realise, analysts say, with people too embarrassed to publicly admit they will vote for them. Australia had the highest levels of greenhouse gas pollution from coal per person than any other developed country in 2021, according to new data. But it shows per-capita greenhouse gas emissions from coal fell sharply last year, with a surge in solar and wind energy seeing rates drop well below the average of the previous five years. Australia is the second most coal-dependant country for power generation in the OECD, behind Poland, according to the data compiled by UK-based thinktank Ember. Israel will not launch a criminal investigation into the killing of the US-Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Aqleh, which Palestinian officials and witnesses have blamed on Israeli soldiers. The Israel defense forces claimed that because Abu Aqleh was killed in an “active combat situation”, an immediate criminal investigation would not be launched, although an “operational inquiry” would continue. According to a report in the Haaretz, the Israeli military police branch has accepted the assurances of Israeli troops that they were not aware she was in a village adjacent to the Jenin refugee camp when she was killed on 11 May. The Biden administration and the UN security council have called for a transparent investigation. National disability insurance scheme participants are spending months longer than needed in hospital as they await funding packages from the agency that runs the scheme, a new report shows. The aged care sector has urged the government to reinstate Covid prevention funding as it grapples with outbreaks in almost 30% of the nation’s residential facilities. The call comes as aged care workers in South Australia and Queensland prepare to walk off the job over unfair pay and conditions. Chinese Australian community leaders are warning that the Coalition’s use of hardline rhetoric against China is turning voters off – and that it could potentially cost the government in the seat of Bennelong. With the cost of living rising and wages stagnating, Anthony Albanese supports lifting the minimum wage by 5.1%. But Scott Morrison says this will make inflation worse. Is he right? Antoun Issa checks the facts. We asked Guardian Australia readers about the local issues that matter most to them this election. Broadband speeds, regional public transport, support for children with cleft palates and pollution topped voters’ lists of concerns. We put their questions to candidates. Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers have ordered all female TV presenters to cover their faces on air, the country’s biggest media outlet has said. The order came in a statement from the Taliban’s virtue and vice ministry, as well as from the information and culture ministry, the Tolo news channel tweeted on Thursday. The statement called the order “final and non-negotiable”, the channel said. The US House of Representatives has passed legislation that would bolster federal resources to prevent domestic terrorism in response to the racist mass shooting in Buffalo, New York – but the bill faces the increasingly familiar burden of an uphill climb to pass the Senate. Students at a school in Bremerhaven, northern Germany, used chairs and tables to barricade themselves in their classrooms after several shots were fired at the building, seriously injuring an adult woman. Police say an armed attacker used an unidentified weapon to injure a female employee at the Lloyd Gymnasium secondary school yesterday morning. In 2018, after a bruising divorce, the British singer Sarah Brown was “broke, financially, emotionally and spiritually – I had nothing to live for”. At her lowest ebb, she turned to a voice that had given her crucial guidance and succour when she was a child: Mahalia Jackson, the pre-eminent gospel star of the 20th century. “Pop music was banned in my home growing up,” Brown says. “But my father owned records by Jim Reeves, Aretha Franklin and Mahalia Jackson. And Mahalia’s voice opened my spirit up. I grew up in a volatile home – my father beat my mum, he beat my older brother. I was seven years old, living in fear.” But in Jackson’s volcanic, resonant, impassioned voice, Brown found much-needed shelter and catharsis. “I was able to scream along with her, and release that fear. Mahalia helped release me.” Emmanuel Carrère was no stranger to depression but it was late in life that a major episode led to him being hospitalised and diagnosed as bipolar. In some ways it made sense of his problems, but in the midst of it, everything was broken. “It’s disturbing, at almost 60 years of age, to be diagnosed with an illness that you’ve suffered from your whole life without it ever being named,” writes Carrère. “Your first reaction is to protest.” This weekend Australians head to the polls.

5/20/2022,"This season cannot finish quickly enough as far as Chelsea are concerned. They have secured third place but this is a club crying out for a fresh start. Everything feels messy. There are gaps in Thomas Tuchel’s defence, his attack remains infuriating and the worry is that nothing can move until Todd Boehly’s consortium has finally ushered in the end of the Roman Abramovich era. Time is of the essence. Stamford Bridge will not be full again until Abramovich is gone and it was easy to see why Chelsea are lagging so far behind Manchester City and Liverpool during this draw with Leicester, who earned a point mainly because their opponents are so blunt in front of goal. The numbers were damning. Tuchel’s side had 20 shots but only seven on target. No wonder they have won one of their last six home games. The issue, as Tuchel pointed out, is Chelsea keep inconveniencing themselves. It feels as if every defensive mistake invites disaster – Leicester’s goal was a case in point, Marcos Alonso dozing off when James Maddison opened the scoring – and nobody typified the lack of edge more than Christian Pulisic, who missed a glaring chance to win the points for Chelsea during the second half. It was that kind of night. There was a weariness to Chelsea as they looked to move on from their defeat to Liverpool in the FA Cup final. They had spent the day celebrating the 10th anniversary of their first Champions League triumph but only so much comfort can be found in the past. The present is uncertain and when the cameras picked out Boehly in the directors’ box it seemed the American was seeing why Tuchel believes Chelsea will struggle to catch City and Liverpool next season. That much was clear when Leicester scored after six minutes. The laxness, epitomised by Alonso allowing a clearance from Kasper Schmeichel to reach Timothy Castagne on the right flank, was appalling. There was still no reaction when Antonio Rüdiger cut out Castagne’s cross, nobody smelling danger when the ball ran to Maddison. Where was the cover? Thiago Silva stepped up but the centre-back seemed off the pace after playing on with an injury against Liverpool. Maddison swept past the 37-year-old and his thumping finish from 20 yards gave Édouard Mendy no chance. While Tuchel seethed Brendan Rodgers applauded Schmeichel’s distribution. There may be doubts over the Dane’s future but his value to Leicester cannot be underestimated. He was soon involved again, denying Trevoh Chalobah an instant equaliser. Chelsea grew frantic. Alonso, who could join Barcelona this summer, was irritating the crowd and there were howls when Romelu Lukaku hesitated when he was through on goal, allowing Daniel Amartey to recover. However Jamie Vardy and Kelechi Iheanacho were isolated up front for Leicester and the equaliser arrived when Reece James cleverly picked out Alonso. The Spaniard’s volley was a reminder of the stronger side of his game. Chelsea took control. Leicester offered nothing during the second half. Chalobah shackled Vardy and Rüdiger was commanding. Chelsea will miss the German when he joins Real Madrid. The rebuild of the defence will be hard. Andreas Christensen, who again was not involved, is heading to Barça, who also want César Azpilicueta. This is not a settled squad. N’Golo Kanté was a driving presence in midfield but his contract expires next year and injuries are a concern. “He is our key player and if he only plays 40% of the games then it is maybe a miracle we arrive in third place,” Tuchel said of the 31-year-old. “He is our Salah, our De Bruyne, our Neymar, our Mbappé. It’s hard to live with. He starts getting rhythm and then is out again.” Frustration lingered. Lukaku headed wide after an hour and Pulisic scuffed wide from six yards. Chelsea, who were fortunate not to have Rüdiger sent off for a lunge on Wesley Fofana, fizzled out. Leicester, drifting in mid-table, held out. Chelsea could only look to the future.",Sport/Football,James Maddison strikes as Leicester earn draw to further frustrate Chelsea ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/19/chelsea-leicester-premier-league-match-report
5/20/2022,"They would not go. Not the fans who invaded the Goodison Park pitch and sang with raw emotion for 30 minutes after the final whistle. Not the players who joined the choir from the other side of a police cordon. Not Frank Lampard, who disappeared in the throng and re-emerged on the roof of the executive boxes to soak up the acclaim. And not Everton. Their Premier League life was ebbing away after 45 desperate minutes against Crystal Palace. They would not go. Five minutes of normal time remained of a fraught but unforgettable encounter. Five minutes for Everton to preserve their top-flight status for a 69th year and avoid having to fight against a first relegation since 1951 on the final day at Arsenal. Dominic Calvert-Lewin timed his impact on Everton’s year to perfection. Throwing himself to meet Demarai Gray’s free-kick, the centre-forward who has missed so much of the season through injury launched himself into Goodison Park folklore with a diving header past Jack Butland. Lampard’s team had been 2-0 down at the interval; chaotic, uncertain and free-falling towards the Championship. Now, galvanised by the half-time introduction of Dele Alli and reprieved by goals from Michael Keane, Richarlison and Calvert-Lewin, they had a comeback to compare with the final day escape against Wimbledon in 1994. The fightback sparked a first, foolish pitch invasion that led to seven minutes of stoppage time. When it was over, however, it was a fightback that will never be forgotten in these parts. Lampard had got the job done. The consequences of relegation were vast for a club in Everton’s financial position and with a new stadium under construction at Bramley Moore dock. Survival allows for a rebuild and, in these circumstances, an understandable celebration. Evertonians could not have done more to push their beloved club over the line. For the third home game in succession the Everton coach was greeted by an impassioned mass of supporters on Goodison Road, but in far greater numbers and with far more blue smoke bombs than preceded Chelsea and Brentford. Repeated appeals over the tannoy for supporters to make room “to allow players access to the stadium” gave a sense of the backing, and desperation, for one final victory in a torturous season. It felt more like the prelude to a cup final than a relegation scrap. The desperation of the crowd seeped into the team’s performance in the first half. The hosts were frantic, nervous and overly reliant on the long punt towards an isolated Calvert-Lewin. The rudimental approach played perfectly into the hands of a composed and confident Palace team. Patrick Vieira dropped two of his most influential midfielders to the bench in Conor Gallagher and Cheikhou Kouyaté but the visitors dominated possession regardless. The guile and intent shown by Eberechi Eze, Wilfried Zaha and Jeffrey Schlupp was in stark contrast to the wastefulness of André Gomes and Abdoulaye Doucouré. The Goodison mood was punctured after Gomes and Doucouré were penalised for fouling Tyrick Mitchell deep in the Everton half. Eze swept a dangerous free-kick to the far post where Jean-Philippe Mateta easily escaped the weak attentions of Doucouré and Vitalii Mykolenko to guide a textbook header beyond Jordan Pickford at close range. Goodison was in uproar again when Anthony Gordon was scissored by a dangerous challenge from Jordan Ayew. The Palace forward went over the top but escaped with a yellow card. Two minutes later he compounded Everton’s torment by doubling the visitors’ lead. It was a calamitous goal to concede, starting when Séamus Coleman was dispossessed by Mateta who darted down the left before crossing. Five blue shirts had chased back but Pickford chose to punch clear and scuffed his clearance to Zaha. The winger’s shot bounced off the ground, Pickford flicked away a save, but only as far as Ayew who scrambled the ball past Mykolenko and Doucouré on the goalline. Everton created next to nothing in the first half. Something had to change and Lampard introduced the lesser-spotted Alli for the badly out-of-sorts Gomes and switched to 4-3-3. It was the former Tottenham playmaker’s first appearance since 1 May and his introduction helped ignite an immediate improvement, taking Everton higher up the pitch and offering more time on the ball. The home side needed an early response. It arrived when Mykolenko delivered a deep free-kick from the left and Mason Holgate headed back to Keane, who controlled with his left thigh before drilling past Butland with his right. Everton’s relentless search for an equaliser left them exposed to the counterattack and Pickford saved well from Mateta. Keane was booked for scything down Eze, Calvert-Lewin was fortunate not to follow suit for a foul on Nathaniel Clyne, but just as Everton appeared to be losing their cool they found a way back. Alli was heavily involved, taking down Coleman’s cross on his chest and volleying low across goal. A Palace touch cleared only as far as Richarlison who miscontrolled with his first touch but managed to release a shot with his second. The ball struck Gallagher, who had replaced Schlupp a minute earlier, and looped beyond Butland. Goodison erupted, and there was more to come.",Sport/Football,Everton safe after Calvert-Lewin completes epic revival against Palace,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/19/everton-crystal-pakace-premier-league-match-report
5/20/2022,"And then there were two. Burnley picked up a precious point at Aston Villa to head into the final day outside the relegation zone and, crucially, with the upper hand on Leeds, who must better Burnley’s result on Sunday to avoid dropping into the Championship. As this game rolled into the sixth of what started as four nervy minutes of second-half stoppage time, Burnley’s supporters celebrated a free-kick on halfway like they did Ashley Barnes’s cool first-half penalty. Even the straight red card shown to the Burnley substitute Matt Lowton could not taint a fine evening. If Burnley do end up securing safety by virtue of their far superior goal difference then they will surely reflect on Nick Pope’s superb showing as a significant chapter in an impressive escape mission. Pope made a trio of fine stops, saving the best until last to deny Bertrand Traoré glancing in, but Burnley will equally wonder how Tyrone Mings prevented the substitute Wout Weghorst from tucking in a winner five minutes from time after Emiliano Martínez instinctively saved from Connor Roberts. Burnley earned one win from their first 21 league games this season but their resurgence since the surprise sacking of Sean Dyche continued here, despite Emi Buendía’s equaliser forcing a draw. Burnley can finish on a high at home to Newcastle on the final day, when Leeds, with whom they are level on points, visit Brentford. In the buildup to this game Burnley’s caretaker manager, Mike Jackson, told how several of his players had pledged to play their part even if not 100% fit and James Tarkowski, who is out of contract next month, impressed after returning to the heart of defence following a hamstring injury sustained in the reverse fixture less than a fortnight ago, which Villa won 3-1 at Turf Moor. Ashley Westwood, who is recovering from a broken ankle, has been mucking in with opposition analysis and Matej Vydra recently paid the squad a visit on crutches after knee surgery. Ben Mee, Tarkowski’s usual sidekick and Burnley’s club captain, recently returned to training but remained on the sidelines in a club tracksuit here, instead helping Jackson with the warm-up and instructing from the away dugout. Burnley created little before they were gifted a chance to open the scoring when Buendía, seconds after barging Tarkowski in the box, upended Maxwel Cornet as the winger chopped inside. The referee, Paul Tierney, pointed to the spot. Buendía looked to the skies and shook his head. Some Burnley fans turned their backs, too nervous to look. They need not have worried, with Barnes coolly sending Martínez the wrong way in front of the Holte End to register his first goal for 15 months. Steven Gerrard was adamant Barnes should not have been on the pitch by then after striking Mings with a stray elbow with five minutes gone. “I think we should have been playing against 10 men from a very early stage,” the Villa manager said. “The PGMOL said there was not enough force for it to be a red card. I heard it and I was 60 yards away. He’s pulled his elbow back and smashed him in the face. Have you got to break someone’s cheek or make someone go off the pitch to be a red card? Everyone knows that’s a red card.” Villa’s equaliser was achingly poor from Burnley’s perspective. Buendía wandered freely into the box to meet a floated John McGinn pass and the unmarked Argentina midfielder smacked in on the volley from a central position, beating Roberts to the punch and exposing Pope in the Burnley goal. Pope equally may feel he should have done better. On 71 minutes it was time for Villa to survive a scare, when Lucas Digne was deemed not to have handled inside the box. The former Burnley forward Danny Ings arrived from the bench in place of Ollie Watkins and went close to finding a winner with his first touch, smacking a shot narrowly wide after reading McGinn’s layoff. The drama increased as the game went on. Pope diverted Traoré’s deft header down to his right and then Villa survived a hairy episode when Martínez and Mings came to their rescue. Pope denied Matty Cash before four minutes of stoppage time, during which the former Villa defender Lowton was given a straight red card for a wholehearted challenge on Calum Chambers. “It’s been a difficult season,” Tarkowski said. “To put ourselves in this position from where we were is a big achievement.”",Sport/Football,Burnley climb out of bottom three with precious point at Aston Villa,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/19/aston-villa-burnley-premier-league-match-report
5/20/2022,"The average price of gas in California has surpassed $6 a gallon for the first time ever as fuel costs across the US reach record highs. Drivers in the Golden state are paying more for a gallon of fuel than anywhere else in the country at an average of $6.06, an all-time high for California and the US, according to AAA. The national average is nearly $4.59 a gallon, also a record, increasing 10 cents since Monday. Meanwhile, in some rural regions of California prices are even higher – fuel costs more than $7 a gallon in Mono county in the state’s east. Prices are surging due to rising demand and tighter supply, according to AAA, and consumers will continue to pay more at the pumps amid the switch to summer blends of fuel, which can add as much as 10 cents a gallon. “The high cost of oil, the key ingredient in gasoline, is driving these high pump prices for consumers,” Andrew Gross, AAA spokesperson, said in a statement this week. “Even the annual seasonal demand dip for gasoline during the lull between spring break and Memorial Day, which would normally help lower prices, is having no effect this year.” With pandemic-induced inflation and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, fuel prices in California have remained high in recent months, even as they fell in other states. Those costs have hit Californians hard, particularly gig workers for whom fuel makes up a large part of their daily costs. The record-breaking costs come as inflation, which is at a nearly 40-year high, has sent the prices of basic necessities soaring. In California, the governor has proposed an $18.1bn relief package to ease the pain of inflation. The plan includes $11.5bn earmarked for $400 checks that would be sent to eligible registered vehicle owners, more than $4bn for emergency rental assistance and past due utility bills, and millions to allow for free public transit for three months and waiving the diesel sales tax. Meanwhile, the state’s minimum wage could reach $15.50 an hour in January due to a law that requires an accelerated increase when inflation rises above 7%. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has faced growing criticism, particularly from conservative lawmakers, that he is not doing enough to combat high fuel costs in the state. Republican lawmakers have advocated for suspending the state’s gas tax, which is the second-highest in the country at 51 cents a gallon, a proposal that is now gaining support from some Democrats. But Democratic leaders have generally been skeptical about pausing the tax as they worry oil companies would not pass the savings along to drivers. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, argues oil companies are to blame for high fuel prices and said his party should target them. “The reality is that every American is sacrificing at this time – paying five bucks, six bucks in my district – at the pump, and they’re seeing big oil making record profits at the same time because of the war in Ukraine,” he told Time earlier this month. “That’s not fair.” Residents in Mono county, which has some of the most expensive gas in the state, echoed Khanna’s criticisms. “Here we are struggling to even work enough to get enough gas even go to work,” Linda Dore told USAToday. “I mean it’s definitely, how many billions do they need?”",News/Business,Average price of gas surpasses $6 a gallon for first time in California,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/california-gas-average-6-gallon-record-high
5/20/2022,"Since the start of his military campaign against Ukraine, Vladimir Putin has railed aggressively against pro-western Russians, whose appetite for European cuisine and climates meant “their mentality is there, not here, with our people”. Yet his own daughter’s enthusiasm for sojourns to western Europe at least matches that of the oligarch “scum and traitors” he has decried, a joint investigation by independent Russian media outlet iStories and German magazine Der Spiegel suggests. According to flight records obtained by the two publications, Putin’s youngest daughter, Katerina Tikhonova, flew to Munich in southern Germany “more than 50 times” between 2017 and 2019, travelling on chartered flights with full state support and in the company of employees of Putin’s own presidential security service. Among the leaked cache of documents relating to a series of flights between Moscow and Munich in spring 2020 are the passports of a then two-year-old girl – apparently a previously unknown granddaughter of the Russian president – and Igor Zelensky, the former director of the Munich state ballet. The report said it is likely that Zelensky is Tikhonova’s partner and the father of her child. Unrelated to the Ukrainian president of the same surname, 52-year-old Igor Zelensky was an internationally feted dancer before he became artistic director of the Bayerisches Staatsballet in 2016. He stepped down from his role on 4 April citing “private family reasons”, having failed to react to calls to condemn Putin’s war of aggression in Ukraine. Zelensky still has a job on the supervisory board of Russia’s National Cultural Heritage Foundation, which is building a cultural centre in Crimea and is understood to be close to Putin. An anonymous source at the Bavarian state ballet told Der Spiegel that Zelensky was “most likely a partner of Putin’s daughter”, before journalists had specifically asked about his family ties. Tikhonova, 35, herself a former acrobatic rock’n’roll dancer, was previously married to Kirill Shamalov, once Russia’s youngest billionaire, though the couple were reported as having separated in 2018. While iStories and Der Spiegel did not disclose the name of the 2017-born child, the outlets wrote that the girl’s patronymic was Igorevna, which would correspond to former ballet director Igor Zelensky. Tikhonova did not respond to a request by Der Spiegel. Her and Zelensky’s current whereabouts are unknown.",News/World news,"Putin’s daughter flew to Munich ‘more than 50 times’, investigation suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/putins-daughter-flew-to-munich-more-than-50-times-investigation-suggests
5/20/2022,"A senior police chief has admitted officers are consulting with counter-terrorism experts about threats from the far right at a military base in North Yorkshire where the Home Office is planning to house 1,500 asylum seekers. On Thursday night a meeting of residents in the small village of Linton-on-Ouse was told that the first people were due to move in in less than two weeks. The chief inspector for Hambleton and Richmondshire, David Hunter, also acknowledged at the meeting that police were being assisted with advice from Counter-Terrorism North East to prepare for the threat of far-right activity which could put the asylum seekers at risk. Home Office officials, along with their sub-contractors Serco who will be managing the accommodation, attended the meeting of Linton Parish council to answer questions about the plans from concerned villagers and campaigners. Approximately 10 far-right protesters gathered outside but were barred from entry by police. Asylum seekers held at other military barracks such as Penally in Wales, which has now closed, and Napier in Kent have experienced harassment from far-right demonstrators. The Home Office is planning to move 1,500 asylum seekers into the military base, a former RAF station which closed in 2020,in the village which has just 700 residents. The first 60 people are due to move in on 31 May. Villagers and activists who oppose the plans have launched a campaign against the Home Office using the slogan “wrong plan, wrong place”. On Wednesday evening Conservative-controlled North Yorkshire county council passed a vote of no confidence in the Home Office “due to the lack of consultation of local communities and stakeholders”. At the parish council meeting on Thursday evening residents were told that there would be guards on the gates at the base and an increased police presence in the village between 8.30am and midnight seven days a week. Home Office officials who attended the meeting said there would be multi-agency forums and sub-groups for local people to raise concerns. The home secretary, Priti Patel, is also to visit to hear their concerns, the meeting was told. Hunter said in response to a question about whether police are prepared for far-right activity at the site: “Counter-Terrorism North East are assisting us and advising us.” Nicola David, chair of Ripon City of Sanctuary and a member of the Linton-on-Ouse action group, said to Home Office officials at the meeting: “You treat asylum seekers like animals, like pawns in your political game.”",News/UK news,Far-right threat feared at huge base for asylum seekers in North Yorkshire village,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/counter-terror-experts-assisting-with-far-right-threat-to-asylum-housing

Ocasio-Cortez, 32, confirmed to Insider on Thursday that she and Roberts, who met while both were at Boston University, got engaged last month while visiting her parents’ home town in Puerto Rico. She then wrote on Twitter: “It’s true! Thank you all for the well wishes.” According to Insider, the pair were quiet about their relationship even before Ocasio-Cortez became a popular political voice, and their friends at university did not always know they were together. Roberts has also been one of her greatest support systems throughout her career, according to a biography published earlier this year, People magazine reported. “What we do know about Roberts doesn’t fit the stereotype of a politician’s partner,” writes Josh Gondelman in an essay in Take Up Space: The Unprecedented AOC by the editors of New York magazine. “He doesn’t seem focus-grouped or media-trained for state dinners and press conferences. We know he’s supportive and encouraging in private,” Gondelman writes. “And his expertise, as far as his public image goes, is his elusiveness and restraint.” The few times Roberts, a marketing professional, has popped up in media it has been with the couple’s dog, Deco, or in the 2018 documentary Knock Down the House.

5/20/2022,"An agent working for MI5 with a background in rightwing extremism abused his former partner and used his connection with the domestic intelligence agency to threaten her further, according to an investigation by the BBC. The man – known only as X for legal reasons – is said to have terrorised the woman and at one point attacked her with a machete and threatened to kill her, as shown in a video captured on her mobile phone. “There was so much psychological terror from him to me, that ultimately culminated in me having a breakdown,” the woman said. The BBC was only able to tell her story after winning a high court battle with the government. Suella Braverman, the attorney general, had applied for an injunction preventing X from being identified, while the BBC argued it was in the public interest to name a man who allegedly poses an ongoing threat to women. In the end the BBC was blocked from identifying the man, a foreign national who worked as a paid informant for MI5 infiltrating extremists networks in the UK. But it was able to broadcast a film about him, released on Thursday. MI5 has a policy of never confirming the identity of its agents or paid informants, although Braverman’s case was mounted on the “hypothetical assumption” that X was an agent. He has reportedly left the UK, and went on to work for a foreign intelligence agency. His former partner, a Briton who the BBC has called Beth to protect her identity, said X told her she would not be able to report his abusive behaviour because of his work for MI5. “It meant that I couldn’t speak out about any of his behaviour towards me, any of the violence I went through, sexual or physical, because he had men in high places who always had his back, who would intervene and who would actively kill me, if I spoke out,” Beth said. During their time together, Beth said she was aware that X was having meetings with contacts, receiving payment and being given surveillance equipment. Although X was paid to inform on networks of rightwing extremists, Beth said he appeared to share their beliefs. The informant praised white supremacist mass murderers and even said that he wanted to commit a similar act of violence. Police did investigate the machete attack, during which X allegedly said he would kill Beth, but the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped the case as it came to court. Beth said the police did not take a full statement from or obtain the mobile video of the violent incident, where X tried to attack her with both the large knife and his fists. The police force and the CPS said the case was discontinued for lack of evidence. X returned to their home and Beth said he continued to threaten her, claiming the security services would support him and that she was “nothing”. But gradually their relationship collapsed. X became subject of another police investigation, which drew in counter-terrorism officers, after it emerged that he had had a private diary in which he allegedly wrote about killing Jews and kept Nazi materials. However, X left the country before the inquiry concluded. A second woman, who had a relationship with X in the same foreign country before he came to the UK, also told the BBC that X was violent to her. The woman, who was given the alias Ruth, said: “He said he would be able to kill me and my daughter, too, and then put our bodies somewhere and no one would ever know who I am.” Ruth had not met or been aware of Beth. She eventually fled to a refuge to escape X and said she was “psychologically broken” by their relationship. During their time together she remembered X kept a book contained lurid fantasies involving “eating children’s flesh”. The BBC said it had established X worked for MI5 as a paid informant for years using various false names. “This is the story of a dangerous MI5 agent, which the government tried to keep secret,” it added. In high court rulings, Mr Justice Chamberlain had said that alleging that X was an undercover informant would put his life at risk. He said the “experience and expertise” of the corporation meant it could make decisions about which details risked identifying X.",News/UK news,"MI5 agent ‘abused and threatened’ ex-partner, BBC investigation reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/mi5-agent-abused-and-threatened-ex-partner-bbc-investigation-reveals
5/20/2022,"Tiger Woods was suffering enough without being afforded front-row viewing as Rory McIlroy raced into the lead at the 104th staging of the US PGA Championship. As McIlroy was rolling back the years – a 65 is the Northern Irishman’s finest start to a major since the 2011 US Open, which he won easily – Woods provided a grim reminder of the scale of his ongoing physical struggles. Woods, playing in just his second event since his right leg was shattered in a car crash in February last year, actually opened brightly at Southern Hills. He birdied the 10th hole, his 1st, and sat two under par after five. Yet by the time Woods limped heavily towards post-round media duties, he had signed for a 74 and was in obvious pain. “My leg is not feeling as good as I would like it to be,” he said. “We’ll start the recovery process and get after it tomorrow. I just can’t load it. Loading hurts, pressing off it hurts, walking hurts and twisting hurts. It’s just golf. If I don’t play that, then I’m all right.” Which, given Woods is so intrinsically linked to this sport, seems like a pretty big problem. This is early in Woods’s latest comeback process but there may be a time in the not-so-distant future when he questions whether his body can withstand golf at the highest level. The 15-time major champion added: “I did not hit a lot of good iron shots. I drove it well but my iron shots were not very good. I didn’t get the ball very close. I got off to a great start and didn’t keep it going. I really didn’t give myself any looks for birdie. I was struggling trying to get the ball on the green and I missed quite a few iron shots both ways. It was a frustrating day.” There was a time when McIlroy would have been intimidated by a major partnership with his idol. On a gusty first round in Tulsa, McIlroy took everything in his stride. He had reached six under par through 14 holes. Bogeys at McIlroy’s 15th and 17th threatened to switch the appearance of a terrific round. The winner of this tournament in 2012 and 2014 converted from 19ft at the last to ensure a five-under-par day’s work. This felt significant; McIlroy now has the fast start in a major he has been chasing for so long. He leads the Americans Will Zalatoris and Tom Hoge by one. Matt Kuchar and Mexico’s Abraham Ancer sit at minus three. So, too, does Justin Thomas after a strong afternoon from the 2017 champion. “It is a great start but I’m not getting ahead of myself,” said McIlroy. “I could easily have shot 68 or 69 today and not led but if I had played the same golf I still would have been as positive about it as I am now. “I hit some great tee shots, some great iron shots and holed some nice putts. I did pretty much everything you need to do out there today. I’m going to have to keep doing that over the next three days if I’m going to have a chance to win.” The third member of the event’s marquee group, Jordan Spieth, looked out of sorts when en route to a 72. His dreams of completing a career grand slam here remain alive but only just. The 1991 winner of this tournament, John Daly, using a cart, was prominent on the leaderboard at two under but bogeyed four of the last five holes to post 72. The 56-year-old was not of a mind to discuss his round. Cameron Smith’s 68 was impressive given it included a double bogey and three bogeys. “My game felt really good, the scorecard just said otherwise at times,” the Australian said. The Scot Robert MacIntyre, seeking to make it nine cuts out of nine in majors, began with a 70. The world No1 and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler is one adrift of MacIntyre. Lee Westwood’s 75 was overshadowed by reports that his long-time sponsor, UPS, has ended its association with the Englishman because of his desire to be part of the Saudi Arabian-backed LIV Golf Series. Sean Bratches, LIV’s chief commercial officer, is believed to have resigned his post.

5/20/2022,"Oklahoma’s Republican-led legislature passed the nation’s strictest abortion ban on Thursday. The bill, if signed into law, would allows citizens to sue anyone, anywhere who “aids or abets” a patient in terminating a pregnancy. The bill bans abortion from conception, even before an egg implants in the uterus, and would go into effect immediately if signed by Republican governor, Kevin Stitt. Abortion providers expect he will do so before the coming week. Like a six-week abortion ban in Texas, Oklahoma’s bill would be enforced by citizens. It would allow anyone, anywhere to sue for $10,000 and “emotional distress”, even if they do not have a relationship to the patient in question. Oklahoma’s bill, “is not one more ban, it is not another ban – it is a first,” said Emily Wales, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which serves patients in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. The law, “encourages bounty hunters to sue their neighbors”, and is a “reversal of history happening before our eyes”. The bill is part of an aggressive push in Republican-led states across the country to scale back abortion rights. “It’s outrageous, and it’s just the latest in a series of extreme laws from around the country,” Vice-President Kamala Harris said in reaction to the law. She said the new bans were designed to “punish and control women”. It comes on the heels of an unprecedented leaked draft opinion from the supreme court, which suggested a majority of conservative justices support a total reversal of Roe v Wade. The landmark decision legalized abortion nearly 50 years ago and invalidated dozens of state abortion bans. A final ruling in a key case from Mississippi, called Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, is expected next month. If the final decision does not change substantially from the leaked draft, the court would in effect return the issue of legal abortion to the states. At least 26 states would be certain or likely to ban abortion. The leaked opinion sparked uproar from Americans who support abortion access, a roughly two-thirds majority according to polls, and human rights leaders. The Oklahoma bill promoted by Collinsville Republican representative Wendi Stearman would prohibit all abortions in the state, except to save the life of a pregnant woman or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest that has been reported to law enforcement. “Is our goal to defend the right to life or isn’t it?” Stearman asked her colleagues before the bill passed on a 73-16 vote mostly along party lines. At least one lawmaker suggested the bill did not go far enough, and suggested also banning treatment for ectopic pregnancies, a life-threatening medical condition in which an embryo implants inside the fallopian tubes. An ectopic pregnancy is never viable. “These people have no idea what they’re talking about, and they are making laws controlling our medical practice and people’s basic rights,” said Dr Iman Alsaden, medical director of Planned Parenthood Great Plains. The bill is one of at least three abortion bans sent to Stitt this year. The other laws include a six-week abortion ban and a criminal abortion ban, though the way the laws will interact is not yet known. The criminal abortion ban, set to take effect this summer if Roe falls, would make it a felony to perform an abortion punishable by up to 10 years in prison, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The lead attorney on challenges to Oklahoma’s various abortion bans, Rabia Muqaddam from the Center for Reproductive Rights, called the legislature “extraordinarily sloppy”. “My understanding is the most restrictive law that takes effect latest controls, but it is extraordinarily bizarre,” said Muqaddam. “We’re challenging everything as it comes.” The laws passed by Oklahoma also have an outsized effect on women in Texas, the state which pioneered civil enforcement of abortion bans. Oklahoma was briefly a haven state for Texan patients, after the supreme court allowed Texas to ban abortion at six weeks in 2021 September. “At this point, we are preparing for the most restrictive environment politicians can create: a complete ban on abortion with likely no exceptions,” said Wales. “It’s the worst-case scenario for abortion care in the state of Oklahoma,” she added.",News/US news,Oklahoma Republican-led legislature passes nation’s strictest abortion ban ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/19/oklahoma-abortion-ban-strictest
5/20/2022,"The abrupt resignation of Alberta’s premier has shocked the western province and raised questions about the ideological direction of Canada’s conservative movement amid a surge in far-right and populist influences. Jason Kenney announced late on Wednesday that he was leaving the province’s top job after barely surviving a leadership review. A slim majority of party members – 51.4% – had voted in favour of keeping him in power but Kenney said that support wasn’t enough to justify remaining head of the governing United Conservatives. “The result is not what I hoped for or frankly what I expected,” Kenney told supporters. The premier had previously said he would view any result above 50% as a win. “He had seemed so doggedly determined to remain on his leader … with even a single vote more than those who voted against him,” said Lori Williams, a professor of political science at Calgary’s Mount Royal University. “So his decision was very much a surprise.” Once a star cabinet minister under former prime minister Stephen Harper, Kenney returned to Alberta to unite warring conservative factions and oust the governing leftwing New Democratic Party. He won a strong majority in 2019, but his tenure was marred by party infighting and threats of mutiny. His pugilistic brand of politics won him allies but also created a growing list of enemies and disaffected party members. “It takes a truly extraordinary leader to try to persuade people who may dislike and disrespect one another to work together for the sake of governance,” said Williams, pointing out the only Canada politician able to effectively take on this challenge was Harper. Kenney’s popularity cratered during the coronavirus pandemic as he fought off criticism from within his own party amid fierce debates over public health measures. Rightwing elements were angered by restrictions on businesses and movement, but more moderate party members feared an overwhelmed health care system. At one point during the pandemic, Alberta had one of the highest coronavirus infection rates in North America. As the debate intensified over who should speak for the party, the premier warned in March that conservative movement was being overrun by far-right “lunatics … trying to take over the asylum”. But turning on his own party probably accelerated challenges to his leadership, say former supporters. Rick Bell, political columnist at the Calgary Sun and longtime advocate of the outgoing premier, wrote that the fall of Kenney was “stunning” but expected. “He never listened. Never. He was right. We all were wrong. Until we were right,” wrote Bell. Even though the province has lifted its public health restrictions and significant revenue from oil and gas is flowing into the provincial treasury, voters seem unwilling to forgive Kenney. Kenney joins a growing list of conservative premiers unable to finish out their term: since 2004, Alberta has seen seven premiers. Only one – New Democrat Rachel Notley – served a full term. But Kenney’s departure amid bitter infighting over the ideological direction of the party, will loom over the current race for a federal Conservative leader. The national party has already turfed two of their leaders in recent years, Erin O’Toole and Andrew Scheer, both of whom campaigned to the right and then tried to woo centrist voters in a general election. “There’s almost competing imperatives facing a leader of a coalition Conservative party. One is to win the support of their own caucus – and the other is to win an election by appealing to a broader range of electors,” said Williams. “But neither really seems compatible.” A federal Liberal from Alberta called the recent resignations a “disturbing trend” among his political rivals. “The conservative movement in this country is heading to a dark place. And I find that very troubling,” Randy Boissonnault told reporters on Thursday. As conservatives in Alberta grapple with their party’s future, Williams sees a difficult and unenviable task for the eventual leader. “You really have to wonder who would want to take this on. Who would want to risk their reputation and their political future on the challenges we’re seeing boiling up within this party?”",News/World news,Canadian premier abruptly quits amid surge in far-right influences,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/alberta-premier-jason-kenney-conservatives-far-right-populism
5/20/2022,"It’s no real surprise that someone was prepped to poke fun at Hollywood’s increasingly aggressive remaking, rebooting and remixing of dust-caked IP, but it’s perhaps more of a surprise to find the joke coming from inside the house. Not just any house either but the House of Mouse, arguably the most egregious offender of all. But the unending sift of studios trawling though their back catalogues (this year promises new spins on Gremlins, Three Men and a Baby, Father of the Bride, Frasier, Scooby Doo, Night at the Museum, Hellraiser, Matilda and many, many others), has resulted in an unusual satire, made even more unusual given the unlikely packaging. The relatively un-hyped release of a live-action-animation-hybrid movie based on late 80s series Chip ’n Dale: Rescue Rangers, offloaded on to Disney+, seemed at first glance to be more of the same. But inside the Trojan horse of a lazily inevitable kids adventure is a surprisingly sharp and detailed comedy. It’s not quite on par with Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, the film it undoubtedly wants to be likened to, but it’s infinitely better than it had any right to be. The original series, which lasted for three seasons on the Disney Channel, was based on one of those strange fever-dream set-ups that kids accepted with unquestioning immediacy. Two semi-clothed chipmunks ran a detective agency with two mice – one Australian, cheese-obsessed, and one blond, object of numerous crushes – and a housefly. In the world of the movie, the characters were all just actors, living and working in a society where humans and cartoons co-exist. Chip (voiced by John Mulaney) and Dale (voiced by Andy Samberg) were childhood best friends who fell out after Hollywood greed and ambition drove them apart and years later, they both live very different, yet very lonely, lives. Chip works in insurance and dotes on his pet dog while Dale desperately clings on to his old fame, haunting fan conventions, waiting for a reboot. When their old friend and co-worker Monterey Jack goes missing, the pair are reunited and uncover a horrifying plot that sees well-known animated characters kidnapped, redrawn and bootlegged to be sold overseas and forced into terrible off-brand movies (The Little Mermaid becomes The Small Fish Lady, Beauty and the Beast becomes Beauty and the Cursed Dog Man etc). What’s most surprising about a mostly rather surprising film is just how intricate the world-building is, director Akiva Schaffer, of Lonely Island fame, and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend writers Dan Gregor and Doug Mand, putting far more thought and effort into the specifics of one scene that most mainstream film-makers would put into their entire movie. It’s stuffed to the edges with pop culture references, sight gags and sly jabs at the industry but falls short of the brain-dead overload that’s tanked adjacent examples. Last year’s one-two gut-punch of Free Guy and Space Jam 2 showed two studios chucking everything they had into a blender, both needlessly packed with often bizarre references to other films and shows also available on Disney and Warner’s respective streamers. It reached parody-level (did one of Ken Russell’s nuns from The Devils really need to be watching LeBron James play basketball with Bugs Bunny?) and the team behind Chip ’n Dale seem highly aware of this, lightly ribbing the headache-inducing state of entertainment (posters for Meryl Streep as Mr Doubtfire and Fast and Furious Babies litter background billboards). There’s also a great deal of fun to be had at the expense of animated progress with Dale undergoing surgery to look more CGI, an amusing trip to the “uncanny valley” where the pair encounter ghoulish motion capture characters from the 2000s and a scene-stealing cameo from Ugly Sonic, AKA the grotesque, fan-loathed version of the character from the recent film’s original trailer. It’s all very much aimed at a savvy thirtysomething audience, while remaining kid-friendly and while younger viewers might find it all a little incomprehensible at times, the many Disney cameos and the frantic pace should ensure at least some interest. Despite the stacked cast of comedians and comedic actors (as well as Mulaney and Samberg, there are voice roles for Seth Rogen, Tim Robinson, Keegan Michael-Key and Will Arnett) the script feels a few punch-ups away from being quite as funny as it could have been. It’s more likely to produce some “oh yeah that’s smart” smiles than genuine laughter, still a little hemmed in by the Disney+-ness of it all. But what Gregor and Mand do manage is a neat balance of tone, the knowing satire never falling into self-referential smugness thanks to a healthy dose of both earnestness and a genuine affection for the source material. Consider those low expectations truly rescued.
