3/28/2022,"Argentina’s last home game before the World Cup turned into an unexpected love-in at La Bombonera on Friday. The penultimate qualifier for the already qualified nation (they play Ecuador away in their last fixture) became the emotional send-off that is usually organised with that specific purpose but which the new calendar means will be impossible at a later point in the year. Asked after the game about his future with the national team post-Qatar, Lionel Messi replied with a “who knows”, so potentially this was his last appearance on Argentinian soil wearing the oversized Argentinian strip, which ironically feels too small for him, at least in official competition. It’s been a long road and ahead of featuring at his fifth World Cup, it was fitting Messi was embraced by the man who gave him his first call-up to the national team – José Pekerman, now manager of Venezuela. The pair hugged as they emerged from the tunnel and it was almost father-son in nature. Venezuela, already eliminated, put up some fight , especially during the first 20 minutes, during which Messi’s deployment as a false No 9 had some nerves on edge. But the team soon adjusted and the Paris Saint-Germain player flourished in a more creative role. The Boca stadium, known as La Bombonera or the Chocolate Box because of its steep terraces, has a pretty unique atmosphere, and that was the case again on Friday. Filled to capacity, the crowd chanting in crescendo, a considerable number of women and children included among the maskless grinning faces, it exuded warmth and joy. The first goal was an explosion of ecstatic hugs, on the pitch as well as in the stands. By the time the third goal arrived, the entire ground was one single, delirious, sparkling feast, phone lights like stars peppering the night sky. It was also emotional. One father who had taken his sons to an Argentina game for the first time afterwards reflected that there is a younger generation who have always had an intense connection with this particular squad. “They have no pending issues, they love them,” he said. Older followers who do have unresolved baggage emerged blissfully nostalgic, perhaps recognising those cherished sensations proffered by simultaneously experiencing hope and the satisfaction of enjoying the moment. It was at once a loving send-off and the beginning of the World Cup dream. Boca fans familiar with the stadium wore their goose-pimples with pride, rival fans gracefully acknowledged the magic of the blue and yellow concrete surrounds, and those who weren’t there shared the moment with poetic gratitude. “This Argentina side is the new Unicorn,” tweeted the writer Roberto Martínez. “It grows, enjoys, desires, are ambitious and everything they try, works”. Some French journalists contrasted Messi’s demeanour with his attitude at PSG – remarkable, really, when one looks back to a time when playing in front of the Argentina crowd seemed to be an unbearable burden, when he got booed playing at home and it seemed he could only muster his magic when featuring for Barcelona. Now the shift is visible to anyone paying attention: he is clearly relishing being the veteran orchestrator of the national side. The World Cup may or may not be a trophy Messi finally gets to lift later this year but the joy of playing for Argentina has undeniably returned for him. Against Venezuela, his range of skills and supernatural capacity to shift rhythm was there for all to see for the entire 90 minutes. He was explosive, fast, skilful, and detailed in his precision. He left opponents spinning, turned, flicked and then burst into speed again. Slouched shoulders and baggy long shorts, he stood clocking the entire field one minute and then executed what he had thought up at the speed of light the next. He initiated Nico González’s opening goal, aideby scoring the third goal himself which was almost a misstep, seemingly laughing at himself while doing so. The road to Qatar has been bumpy at times, but a generation of Pekerman boys are now the men in charge and have delivered Argentina’s longest undefeated run in decades. Manager Lionel Scaloni, assistants Pablo Aimar and Walter Samuel, youth team manager Javier Mascherano, all at the helm and all, like Messi, exchanged warm greetings with their former manager on Friday. It was a collective show of respect and dignity, the symbolic passing of the torch from master to pupils and a literal display of how the game lives and moves on, tradition forging in real time. Life in Argentina is tough, economically and socially. As is the case elsewhere, Covid has taken its toll. And so football has once again become the thing the nation turns to for joy, for a release. And nothing encapsulates that better than the sight of Messi in national team colours with a ball at feet and, once again, a smile on his face.",Sport/Football,Lionel Messi and Argentina look in harmony with World Cup dream alive,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/28/lionel-messi-and-argentina-look-in-harmony-with-world-cup-dream-alive
3/28/2022,"Author Bernadine Evaristo is among the public figures to have condemned Will Smith for hitting Chris Rock at the Oscars, saying the actor “resorted to violence instead of utilising the power of words”. In what quickly became the bombshell moment of the ceremony, Smith struck Rock in the face after the comic made a joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. “Jada, can’t wait for GI Jane 2,” Rock said in an apparent reference to her shaved hair, which is a result of the hair loss condition alopecia. Smith walked on stage and hit Rock before returning to his seat and shouting: “Keep my wife’s name out of your fucking mouth.” Evaristo, the Man Booker prize-winning writer, tweeted: “What a thing to wake up to. Only the fifth black man in nearly 100 years to win an Oscar for male lead, and the first in 16 years, resorts to violence instead of utilising the power of words to slay Chris Rock. Then he claims God and love made him do it.” The four other black men who have won an Oscar for best actor are Denzel Washington, Sidney Poitier, Jamie Foxx and Forest Whitaker. Shortly after the incident, Smith won the Oscar for best actor for his portrayal of Richard Williams in King Richard, and used his speech to make a tearful apology, saying he wanted to be “a vessel for love”. “I want to apologise to the Academy. I want to apologise to all my fellow nominees,” he said. “Art imitates life. I look like the crazy father, just like they said about Richard Williams. But love will make you do crazy things.” The moment has since spawned a frenzy of responses, from delighted memes to anger and concern. The Last Samurai producer, Marshall Herskovitz, called on the Academy to take disciplinary action against Smith, while actor Mia Farrow tweeted: “It was just a joke.” “The ‘vessels of love’ I have known or admired never acted violently against another human being…” tweeted the actor Cary Elwes. In the UK, Keir Starmer said Smith’s actions at the Oscars fell on the “wrong side of the line”. The Labour leader said: “Of course there are circumstances and anybody who insults family members excites something quite emotional in all of us. But, on the other hand, to go up and hit someone in that way is wrong, I’m afraid … It was the Oscars, it’s got all the cameras there, millions of people watching.” “Let me tell you something: it’s a very bad practice to walk up on stage and physically assault a comedian,” tweeted Kathy Griffin. “Now we all have to worry about who wants to be the next Will Smith in comedy clubs and theaters.” While many were appalled by Smith’s behaviour, seeing it as an example of the normalisation of violence, they also said Rock’s comments went too far, especially after a previous gag he made about Pinkett Smith during the 2016 Oscars. “Violence isn’t OK. Assault is never the answer,” tweeted actor Sophia Bush. “Also? This is the 2nd time that Chris has made fun of Jada on the Oscars stage and tonight he went after her alopecia. Punching down at someone’s autoimmune disease is wrong. Doing so on purpose is cruel. They both need a breather.” Nadhim Zahawi said Rock was “mistaken” to make a joke about Pinkett Smith. “Violence is never the answer to any problem-solving, as Will Smith admitted in that tearful, heart-wrenching apology,” the education secretary said. “I think we should also remember – and I’m the education secretary – that actually sometimes even a joke can be below the belt. When a joke is about somebody’s wife and her illness – she has alopecia – it is wrong.” Dying at this photo from the Vanity Fair #Oscars viewing party…. pic.twitter.com/YAvcr2KN6O US Representative Ayanna Pressley, who has also been open about stigma faced with alopecia, tweeted and deleted a defence of Smith. “Alopecia nation stand up! Thank you Will Smith. Shout out to all the husbands who defend their wives living with alopecia in the face of daily ignorance and insults,” the deleted tweet read. Smith’s 23-year-old son Jaden Smith tweeted: “And that’s how we do it.” The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the Oscars, tweeted that it “does not condone violence of any form,” while the Los Angeles police department told Variety that Rock had “declined to file a police report”.",Arts/Film,Celebrities react to Will Smith hitting Chris Rock at the Oscars,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/celebrities-react-will-smith-hitting-chris-rock-the-oscars
3/28/2022,"A Republican senator and reputed presidential hopeful found himself in a tough spot when he claimed tax rises contained in his own “11 point plan to rescue America” were “Democratic talking points” instead. “No, no, it’s in the plan!” his interviewer exclaimed, on Fox News Sunday. “It’s in the plan!” Rick Scott, from Florida, is a former healthcare chief executive whose company admitted 14 felonies related to fraudulent practices. As the South Florida Sun-Sentinel put it, “most happened under Scott’s leadership”. As the Guardian reported, when Scott was governor of Florida “his administration presided over the effective blocking of $70m in federal funds available for fighting the state’s HIV crisis”. Scott beat an incumbent Democrat for a Senate seat in 2018 and is now chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) as the party eyes a Senate takeover in the midterm elections. Last month, Scott released an “11 Point Plan to Rescue America”. It proposes that more Americans pay federal income tax and says Congress could “sunset” social security and Medicare within five years, meaning allow them to lapse. The plan immediately came under fire. The non-partisan Institution on Taxation and Economic Policy (Itep) said Scott’s plan “would increase taxes by more than $1,000 on average for the poorest 40% of Americans”. Itep also noted the effect Scott’s plan would have on Republican heartlands, saying the states most affected, “where more than 40% of residents would face tax increases, are … Mississippi, West Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Georgia, New Mexico, South Carolina and … Florida”. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, disowned the plan, saying: “We will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people and sunsets social security and Medicare within five years.” Dana Milbank, a Washington Post columnist, said Scott had given Democrats a much-needed election-year gift. “All Democrats need do,” he wrote, regarding a plan which would also cut trade with China and slash tax-gathering resources, “is repeat Scott’s own words.” The Fox News Sunday host John Roberts asked Scott: “Why would you propose something like that in an election year?” Scott said Roberts was repeating “Democrat talking points”. “No, no, it’s in the plan!” Roberts said. “It’s in the plan!” Scott said: “But here’s the thing about reality for a second.” Roberts said: “But, Senator, hang on. It’s not a Democratic talking point! It’s in the plan!” Scott defended his plan, saying, “We ought to every year talk about exactly how we are going to fix Medicare and social security” but “no one that I know of wants to sunset” either. “Here’s what’s unfair,” he added, of his tax plan. “We have people that … could go to work and have figured out how to have government pay their way. That’s not right. They ought to have some skin in the game. I don’t care if it’s a dollar. We ought to all be in this together.” Scott is reportedly Donald Trump’s choice to replace McConnell as Senate leader – an effort which shows no sign of succeeding. Scott was asked if, with a Wall Street Journal column entitled “Why I’m Defying Beltway Cowardice”, he was calling McConnell a coward. He dodged the question, saying he wanted “to get something done”. Complaining about “the woke left” and Democratic policy on immigration and energy, he said: “We’ve got to change this. You don’t change it without having a plan.”",News/US news,Republican senator says tax rises in own plan are ‘Democratic talking points’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/28/rick-scott-republican-senator-tax-rises-plan

3/28/2022,"Chelsea meant business at the King Power Stadium on Sunday, scoring nine times and securing their 12th clean sheet of the season against Lydia Bedford’s Leicester. The last time these two met it was a nippy February evening in the FA Cup where Chelsea racked up a similar tally of goals (seven). A repeat performance from Leicester’s leaky defence wasn’t going to go unpunished. Guro Reiten kicked off the scoring with a beautiful free-kick that curled past Demi Lambourne. Ten minutes later, Sam Kerr, Aniek Nouwen and Bethany England had added to the count. At 5-0, things were already looking fairly bleak for the hosts; they were pegged back another four times before the final whistle was blown. The result puts Chelsea at the summit of the WSL for the first time this season with five games left to play. MN The decision of Manchester United to host struggling Everton at Old Trafford was a shrewd one. Often, clubs have hosted their biggest derby rivals or closest competitors at their main stadia in order to help draw a crowd. That can backfire though, as suffering a disappointing defeat could, unfortunately, put people off coming back or making the trip to Leigh Sports Village where the team play week-in week-out. Against Everton it had looked like United would do just that as Claire Emslie’s fourth-minute goal gave the visiting team the lead but United turned the game on its head, earning a 3-1 win to remain unbeaten in two games at the Theatre of Dreams. In the quest to make the team feel at home on the big stage, winning goes a long way, and United have begun the process of making Old Trafford a second home, not an alien one. SW Sign up to our new women’s football newsletter The postponement of Arsenal’s showpiece game against Tottenham at the Emirates because of a Covid outbreak among the visiting team was disappointing. Not least because, should Arsenal beat Wolfsburg next week to progress in the Champions League, finding a space in the calendar for the game to be played will be difficult. With only 5,018 fans in attendance for Wednesday’s home game against the Bundesliga leaders, there was confidence that Saturday’s north London derby would boast a far more impressive attendance in the midday sun. Now, Arsenal women don’t just have to contend with their own crowded calendar but also have to navigate the men’s programme if the rescheduled fixture is to be played at the Emirates. SW Aston Villa ended their run of 10 successive defeats in the league this weekend, coming from behind to earn a point against Reading thanks to an outstanding piece of combination play from Laura Blindkilde and Ramona Petzelberger. The hosts went a goal down in the 69th minute when Justine Vanhaevermaet converted from the penalty spot; and at that moment all evidence suggested an 11th consecutive loss was on its way. Seven minutes later, however, Blindkilde made a gutsy run down the Villa right-flank. Dribbling to the byline, the midfielder crossed the ball towards the far-post. The result was a flying header from Petzelberger that zipped past Grace Moloney’s reach, into the goal. The draw spells more trouble for Reading whose poor form continues. They now have claimed only two points out of 18 in their last six games. For Villa this could potentially be something to build on. MN Manchester City were on a seven-game winning run across all competitions heading into round 18 of the Women’s Super League but their match against Birmingham City was postponed after a Covid outbreak in the Blues’ squad. The question comes now if this disruption will impact their flow as Gareth Taylor’s side. City were back to their best, with their winning run including a Continental Cup title, after a disastrous start to the season. It’s easy to forget how precarious the opening rounds were for City. It was their worst start to a WSL season and many fans were calling for Taylor’s sacking. The manager remained in his post and he’s brought the team back to the high standard we know them to have but this postponement could knock the wind out of their sails. If their form isn’t impacted, what will be influenced is their workload as they will have to fit in this rescheduled fixture. SR West Ham were the architects of their own downfall as a defensive howler in their 2-0 loss to Brighton took the game out of reach for the home side. Hawa Cissoko passed the ball back to her own goal in an attempt to control the pressure from the visitors. However, a miscommunication between goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold and defender Grace Fisk saw neither run to take it initially. They then realised Inessa Kaagman could pounce and both came to claim it. This meant the ball was bungled out of their possession into Kaagman’s path. She struck to score in an open goal and Fisk didn’t even attempt to run to clear it off the line. She looked defeated from the team’s blunder which put the match firmly in Brighton’s hands.

3/28/2022,"France elects its next president in two rounds of voting on 10 and 24 April that will determine the course of western Europe’s second-largest country for the next five years. Twelve candidates – eight men and four women – qualified for inclusion on the first round ballot paper by gathering the necessary 500 endorsements from elected officials. Only a handful, however, have any chance of progressing to the second round run-off, including the favourites Emmanuel Macron, the outgoing president, and Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally. Polls suggest three others will secure more than 10% of the vote: the hard-left veteran Jean-Luc Mélenchon; Le Pen’s far-right rival, the anti-immigrant polemicist Éric Zemmour; and Valérie Pécresse of the rightwing Les Républicains party. While the split in the far-right vote and Russia’s war on Ukraine favour Macron, the result is far from a foregone conclusion: 40% of voters are still undecided, and the president’s team are particularly worried about the possibility of a low turnout. The election’s outcome will have an impact beyond France, to the rest of European Union (France is the EU’s second largest economy) and beyond. Since Angela Merkel left office, the liberal, centrist Macron has become the bloc’s most visible leader, a believer in greater “European sovereignty” and an outspoken defender of western values with a clear desire to shape world events. A Le Pen victory would deal a heavy symbolic blow to the EU and be widely seen as a further populist, nation-first threat to the bloc’s drive for greater integration. To qualify for the first round, each candidate had to secure the backing of at least 500 of more than 40,000 MPs, MEPs, senators, regional councillors and mayors from at least 30 different départements and overseas territories by 4 March. Assuming – as is virtually certain – that none wins a majority in the first round, the two highest scorers will then face off against each other two weeks later. The winner of that second round needs to score more than 50% of the vote. The two-round system, also used in parliamentary, local and regional polls, was introduced in 1962 by Charles de Gaulle and has thus far proved effective at keeping extremists from power: the French say you vote first with your heart, then your head. Macron’s victory in 2017 at the head of a centrist political startup blew up France’s political landscape in spectacular fashion, plunging the combined score of traditional left and right parties of government to a historic low. The Socialist party (PS), which in 2012 controlled the Élysée, parliament and most of France’s regions, was shattered. Its presidential candidate came fifth on 6.4% of the vote, a worst-ever score, and in parliamentary elections it lost 250 of its 280 MPs. According to polls, the French left, including the Green party (EELV), should attract about 27% of the vote – more than enough to reach the second round if it was cast for a single candidate. However, the vote will be divided between six candidates. These include Mélenchon, the leader of La France Insoumise (Unbowed France) and the only leftwing candidate forecast to reach double figures; the Socialist candidate, the Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo; the Greens’ Yannick Jadot; and the Communist Fabien Roussel. Christiane Taubira, a former Socialist justice minister, won a “popular primary” intended to unify the left but Mélenchon, Jadot and Hidalgo refused to recognise it. She withdrew her candidacy in early March after failing to win 500 endorsements. The conservative Les Républicains (LR) were also hit by the arrival of Macron and his La République En Marche (LaREM), failing in 2017 to make the second round for the first time since 1981. In a France that polls suggest has shifted rightwards, LR is still a potent force: it came back strongly in regional elections last year. But squeezed on one side by Macron, whose centre-right economic policies appeal to moderate conservatives, and on the other by Le Pen and Zemmour, vying for more traditionalist and sovereignist voters, it has little room to manoeuvre. On the far right, the battle between the two rivals is fierce. Le Pen’s efforts to “detoxify” her 50-year-old nationalist party left her exposed to Zemmour’s more virulent xenophobic rhetoric, leading to defections from the National Rally ranks – including by Le Pen’s popular, more socially conservative niece, Marion Maréchal . Observers believe Zemmour’s longer-term aim is the demise of the National Rally and the foundation of a new national-sovereignist movement uniting the far right with the more traditionalist right who cannot bring themselves to vote for Le Pen. Emmanuel MacronFrance’s president, a former merchant banker and economy minister under his Socialist predecessor, François Hollande, is an economically liberal, pro-business reformist, but a progressive on most social issues. Despite his promise to be “neither right nor left”, in office he is widely perceived as having drifted rightwards. He has also suffered from a reputation for arrogance and aloofness that he has tried to temper. A “rally round the flag” effect at the start of the war in Ukraine led to a polling boost that is fading, but Macron remains favourite. Marine Le PenThe leader of the National Rally wants to end immigration, slash crime, eradicate Islamism and save France from globalisation, but has rowed back on plans to pull it out of the EU. Her “economic nationalism” would favour French business, while “France-first” social policies in housing, health, education and employment would favour French people. Her place in the polls suggests her long drive to sanitise the party founded by her father, Jean-Marie, in 1972 has largely succeeded in softening its image and normalising its policies, while past statements expressing admiration for the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, do not appear to have done significant electoral damage. Jean-Luc MélenchonThe outspoken leader of La France Insoumise party was a junior Socialist minister from 2000 to 2002 and has campaigned for a shorter working week, lower retirement age, higher minimum wage, benefits and top tax rate, and the end of the presidential regime of the Fifth Republic. A talented orator, he has been climbing in the polls for the past several weeks, but analysts believe he may struggle to match his performance in the 2017 campaign, when he polled almost 20%. Eric ZemmourA far-right TV polemicist who has convictions for inciting racial hatred and promotes the “great replacement” theory that Muslim immigrants will “replace” the populations of European countries, Zemmour has won a following for his violent diatribes against immigration. His book on the supposed decline of France has been a bestseller. Despite some large and enthusiastic rallies, Zemmour’s support has, however, faded in recent weeks and in particular since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Valérie PécresseThe president of the greater Paris Île-de-France region, the candidate of the rightwing Les Républicains is a former budget minister and has described herself as “two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher”. Socially conservative (she was heavily involved in anti-gay marriage protests, although has since said she will not revisit the issue), she has tacked towards the hard right on immigration but remains relatively centrist by LR standards on the economy. The need to represent all factions of her party, however, has led to some confused messaging and a campaign that has so far failed to take off. Yannick JadotThe choice of Europe Ecologie Les Verts (EELV), France’s Green party, Jadot withdrew in 2017 to boost the flagging chances of the doomed Socialist candidate but is now aiming to transfer the success his party enjoyed in 2020’s local elections, when it picked up several big city halls, to the national level. He is campaigning for what he has called “concrete ecology in action”: green solutions for commuting, housing, food, rebuilding local economies. Anne HidalgoThe first female mayor of Paris has highlighted her working-class, Spanish-immigrant roots and promised to improve salaries, particularly for teachers. Although her green, car-free policies were popular enough to win her a second mayoral term, she may struggle to shed her image as “too Parisian” for the rest of France, and her flagging campaign is suffering from deep divisions in the Socialist camp. Polls show Macron winning the first round by a margin of nine or 10 points over Le Pen. Mélenchon is four or five points behind, followed by Zemmour and Pécresse. In the second round, Macron is predicted to beat Le Pen by more than a dozen percentage points. A lot, however, can still change. French presidential election campaigns have a history of throwing up unexpected events that have sometimes dramatically influenced results. France holds legislative elections, also over two rounds, on 12 and 19 June – and without a majority in parliament a French president’s powers are limited. Even if Macron is favourite for the presidential poll, his LaREM party has failed to build grassroots support and polled disappointingly in regional, local and European elections. Many analysts foresee a splintered parliament possibly requiring complex negotiations and alliance-building to secure a majority.",News/World news,French elections 2022: what could happen when country heads to polls?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/french-election-2022-polls-macron-le-pen-pecresse
3/28/2022,"Philip Jeck, the experimental British composer who deployed sampling and DJing to highly imaginative ends, has died aged 69 after a short illness. The founders of Touch, the record label that released his music, announced the news, writing that Jeck was “a remarkable man and a wonderful artist,” and that “he has been one of the kingpins of our work for 30 years. But with Philip it was never just the work, more the love, the spirit and the dedication. He touched so many with his wit, his zest for life and his wisdom.” Jeck was acclaimed across the global underground music scene for a career that encompassed 12 albums and a number of other works, using dilapidated vinyl records and players salvaged from junk shops, in tandem with instrumentation and electronic effects, to create haunting ambient music of great poignancy. After studies at Dartington College of Arts and an inspirational trip to New York where he became enthralled by the record mixing of dance music DJs such as Walter Gibbons and Larry Levan, Jeck began a long collaboration with dancer and choreographer Laurie Booth, providing music for his performances. Breakthrough success came with the 1993 art installation Vinyl Requiem which used 180 turntables alongside film projections, in a collaboration with Lol Sargent – it won a Time Out award that year. Jeck began his recording career with the album Loopholes in 1995 and, alongside his solo work, collaborated with musicians including Gavin Bryars, Jaki Liebezeit and Jah Wobble. His work was hailed by theorist Mark Fisher as being part of the “hauntology” movement of artists who drew on recorded musical history as part of their practise. Jeck also performed live in semi-improvised performances that drew on his vast collection of discarded vinyl, which then formed the basis of his album recordings. “I’ve got so many records that, in a way, I’m drawing on pretty well the whole history of music, which is very overwhelming,” he once said.",Arts/Music,"Philip Jeck, acclaimed British experimental composer, dies aged 69",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/28/philip-jeck-acclaimed-british-experimental-composer-dies-aged-69
