1/22/2022,"In the aftermath of the deadly attack on the US Capitol last year, the rightwing Fox News host Sean Hannity pleaded with a top aide to Donald Trump that there should be “no more stolen election talk” and “no more crazy people” should be admitted to the president’s orbit.  Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, agreed – but to little effect. More than a year after the riot, around which seven people died as Trump supporters sought to stop certification of electoral college results, Trump continues to lie that the 2020 election was stolen by Joe Biden. He also continues to keep company with far-right conspiracy theorists including Mike Lindell, the MyPillow founder who in a lawsuit this week was accused of being “crazy like a fox”. Hannity has also long been close to Trump, as an informal adviser and sometime rally guest. Though he has been revealed to have been shaken by the attack on the Capitol, he has spent the year since the riot supporting Trump’s version of events. The House committee investigating January 6 has asked for Hannity’s cooperation, a request a lawyer for the host said raises “first amendment concerns regarding freedom of the press”. Hannity has previously said he does not claim to be a journalist. Excerpts of his messages to McEnany on 7 January 2021 were included in a letter from the January 6 committee to Ivanka Trump, the former president’s daughter and adviser whom the panel also wishes to question. “First,” the letter said, “on 7 January, Mr Hannity texted Ms McEnany, laying out a five-point approach for conversations with President Trump. Items one and two of that plan read as follows: “1 – No more stolen election talk. “2 – Yes, impeachment and 25th amendment are real, and many people will quit… ” McEnany, the letter said, responded: “Love that. Thank you. That is the playbook. I will help reinforce… ” If McEnany did follow Hannity’s playbook, it did not produce a touchdown or even a reasonable punt. It has been widely reported that invoking the 25th amendment, which provides for the removal of a president deemed incapable of carrying out his or her duties, was seriously discussed among cabinet and White House officials. That came to nothing but Trump was impeached a second time. He was acquitted when enough Senate Republicans stayed loyal. On Friday, Politico published the text of a draft executive order for the seizure of voting machines and the text of a speech in which Trump would have condemned the Capitol rioters – but which he never gave. According to the January 6 committee, Hannity also told McEnany: “Key now. No more crazy people.” McEnany said: “Yes. 100%.” A footnote to the letter says Katrina Pierson, another rightwing commentator, “also uses the term ‘crazies’ in her text messages, apparently to describe a number of the president’s supporters”. Lindell continues to insist he has evidence the 2020 election was stolen, recently claiming his work could lead to the imprisonment for life of “300 and some million people”. That prompted the Washington Post to ask: “Are you one of the one in 11 Americans Mike Lindell doesn’t want to arrest?” In remarks at a Trump rally in Arizona last weekend, Lindell took aim at Hannity’s employer. “When was the last time you saw anyone on Fox talk about the 2020 election?” he asked. Fox News has continued to stoke conspiracy theories about the Capitol riot but Fox Corporation faces lawsuits regarding claims of a stolen election. This week, Lindell joined Fox in being sued by Smartmatic, a maker of election machines. In the suit, the company accused Lindell of knowing what he was doing – namely, trying to sell pillows – when spreading election lies. He was, the company said, “crazy like a fox”.",News/US news,Texts show Fox News host Hannity’s pleas to Trump aide after Capitol attack,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/21/fox-news-hannity-texts-trump-mcenany-capitol-attack-6-january-committee

1/22/2022,"In the heady days between Donald Trump’s defeat in November 2020 and the 6 January insurrection at the US Capitol, an executive order was prepared. It commanded the defense secretary to seize voting machines in battleground states, as part of Trump’s “big lie” that the vote was rigged.  The draft executive order, obtained and published by Politico, was never sent and its author is unknown. It was part of a cache of documents handed over to the House committee investigating the 6 January violence, after the supreme court ruled this week that Trump could not shield himself from oversight on grounds of executive privilege. The disclosure of the draft order adds to evidence of the lengths to which Trump and his close advisers were prepared to go to keep him in the White House, against the will of the American people. Under the draft order, the defense secretary would have been required to carry out an assessment of the voting machines “no later than 60 days from commencement of operations”. That would have pushed the chaos that Trump assiduously attempted to sow around Joe Biden’s legitimate victory well beyond the handover of power at the inauguration on 20 January. The publication of the document will provoke intense speculation as to who wrote it. Politico pointed out that at the time the draft order was dated, 16 December 2020, the idea of seizing voting machines in key states was being vigorously promoted by Sidney Powell, a controversial lawyer who had Trump’s ear at the time. The document outlines the seizure of voting machines by the Pentagon under federal emergency powers. That would in itself have been incendiary, as it would have amounted to a dramatic display of federal over state power of the sort normally fiercely resisted by Republicans. The author of the draft order seeks to justify such a contentious move by regurgitating conspiracy theories. For example, pointing to voting machines, the document says there is “evidence of international and foreign interference in the November 3, 2020, election”. It names Dominion Voting Systems, a leading provider of voting machines that has become the target of rightwing conspiracy theorists and big lie merchants. Dominion has sued several purveyors of false claims that its products were used to swing the election from Trump to Biden. “Dominion Voting Systems and related companies are owned or heavily controlled and influenced by foreign agents, countries, and interests,” the draft order falsely claims. The draft also singles out Antrim county, Michigan. Claims that voting machines in that county were compromised have been thoroughly rebutted, including by state election authorities. A second document was also leaked to Politico from the new mountain of paperwork received by the 6 January committee. Titled Remarks on National Healing, it appears to be the text of a speech Trump never delivered. The tone of the speech is striking because it stands in stark contrast to the approach Trump actually adopted in the wake of the Capitol violence. Still president for two weeks, he attempted to belittle the significance of the day. Had this alternative speech been given, Trump would have sent out a very different message. It describes 6 January as a “heinous attack” that left him “outraged and sickened by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem”. The text added: “The Demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol have defiled the seat of American democracy.”",News/US news,Draft Trump order told defense chief to seize swing-state voting machines,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/21/donald-trump-voting-machines-draft-executive-order
1/22/2022,"The terrible conversation in the hospital consulting room – everyone’s final rite of passage – is the starting point for this deeply felt, beautifully acted movie from screenwriter Kazuo Ishiguro and director Oliver Hermanus: a remake of Akira Kurosawa’s 1953 film Ikiru, or To Live. A buttoned-up civil servant works joylessly in the town planning department; he is a lonely widower estranged from his grasping son and daughter-in-law. In the original, he was Mr Watanabe, played by Takashi Shimura. Now he is Mr Williams, played by Bill Nighy.  Approaching retirement, his supposed reward for a life of pointless tedium, Mr Williams receives a stomach-cancer diagnosis with one year to live. And now he realises that he has been dead until this moment. After a mad and undignified attempt at boozy debauchery in the company of a louche writer (Tom Burke), Mr Williams realises there is one thing he might still achieve: forcing the city authorities to build the modest little children’s playground for which local mothers have been desperately petitioning and which he and his colleagues have been smugly preventing with their bureaucratic inertia. Through sheer force of will, and astonishing his co-workers with his deeply unbecoming new urgency and baffling desire to help people, Mr Williams is determined to get the playground built before death closes in. When Kurosawa’s film came out, it was set in the present day: a fiercely contemporary work about modern Japan and very different from his period dramas. Hermanus and Ishiguro have taken the decision to set it in 1953 as well, and so ingeniously recasting it as a historical piece: Nighy’s melancholy functionary works in the postwar London county council. He is ramrod straight in his pinstripe suit and bowler, an English gentleman through and through, whereas Shimura’s Mr Watanabe in Tokyo was doubled over with the pain of stomach cancer, in a parodic and deepening bow of Japanese respect. Nighy is heartbreakingly shy and sensitive, his refined, almost birdlike profile presented to the camera in occasional stark and enigmatic closeups. This is a man who has had to suppress a natural wit and affectionate raillery all his life in the service of a dull job which meant nothing. His poignantly damaged rebirth has been caused by his diagnosis, and also his platonic yet nonetheless scandalous infatuation with a female junior: the innocently flirtatious Margaret (Aimee Lou Wood), who entrances him, perhaps chiefly because she is quitting this dull office and trying something new. Meanwhile, a young man just starting there, played by Alex Sharp, intuits Mr Williams’s pain and sees how he himself might wind up the same way, out of unexamined loyalty to this older generation’s self-sacrificial woes. Ishiguro has jettisoned the enigmatic, almost Capraesque voiceover from Kurosawa’s film, lost also the local gangsters that Watanabe faces down with his new, reckless courage of cancer. Maybe they seemed too Greeneian in 50s Britain. He has found a sweeter, more positive interpretation of the film’s final scenes, and a redemptive love affair among the younger generation, but kept the central structural coup in Ikiru, positioning the moment of the civil servant’s death so that we see all the besuited functionaries bickering and posturing after Mr Williams is gone, like Ivan Ilych’s colleagues in Tolstoy’s story or the people divvying up Scrooge’s bed linen in A Christmas Carol. I was sorry that Ishiguro removed my favourite moment from Ikiru, when the civil servant, in a flash of existential panic, realises that he cannot think of any specific thing that has happened in his 30 years’ employment. It has all passed like a swift, featureless dream. But Ishiguro makes an inspired adjustment to the children’s playground itself – with Mr Williams noting that though some children are badly behaved and tantrum-prone when they are called away by their mothers, that is better than being one of those children who just hopelessly wait for playtime to end. In Living, the playground is not simply the widow’s-mite gift the civil servant has poignantly handed over to the community before his death. With its humble little swing set and roundabout, it is a symbol of everyone’s brief attempt at living. This is a film which resonated in my mind, with its perennial question: isn’t it possible to achieve Mr Williams’s passionate dedication without the terminal diagnosis? After all, haven’t we all got that diagnosis? Or is the terrible paradox that you need to be told what you know already but were trying not to think about? A gentle, exquisitely sad film.

1/22/2022,"It was interesting this week to see the fascination on social media with close-up clips of the celebrations after Tottenham’s 3-2 win at Leicester. This stuff is very popular right now. The digital eye has detected a hunger out there, a shared sweet spot for footage of unbound emotion, feelings-porn: players and fans lost in the moment, Antonio Conte baying and leaping and glowering like a bear startled by a hornets’ nest.  In a more professional guise I should probably be talking here about how worrying this is, what a red flag it is to see people piling over the advert boards, uncontrolled “intruders” and so on. But that would be a lie, because it didn’t feel worrying. It felt great. Feed me more of this. Stick that spike in my arm and juice me up with Lucas Moura leaping on the back of a steward and waving at the crowd. These are feelings. And feelings are the good thing. It seems as though something has clarified around this recently. There has for some time been a vague fear that this will stop happening, that this shared spectacle will become instead cold visual product, managed entertainment, that the feelings, which are essentially what we have left, will just stop happening. Little wonder when it goes off like that the reaction is visceral and moreish. This is a roundabout way of getting on to the week’s most sensational story, the delicious prospect of Wayne Rooney becoming the next Everton manager. Rooney is currently the favourite for the job, which is in itself odd because all the hard evidence suggests this would be at best a leap in the dark, at worst a disaster in the making. Shall we do the reality first? Most obviously Rooney is not really qualified. His only experience, a year and a bit in the bizarro world, the exposed reactor core of Derby County has no relationship to the very specific demands of leading one of the richest clubs in Europe and facing off against the best tacticians in world football. This is not to downplay what Rooney has done with Derby. It has been a majestic piece of work, with a level of care and a soulfulness that suggests his second footballing life has a long way to run from here. But nobody, not even Rooney, knows what kind of coach he is yet. Other than, in this case, another chance to play out the fallacy of the DNA Appointment. These generally fail, mainly because the notion of club DNA as a workable plan dissolves into a laughable simplicial in the cold light of elite competition. This is football’s version of medieval medicine, the idea that you treat a cold by singeing the flesh with fire, that a lack of passion can be cured with a poultice of ground Rooney flakes inserted under the fingernails. In reality Premier League clubs have done best when they junk their own past. Jürgen Klopp, Arsène Wenger and Alex Ferguson all succeeded by ripping out what they found and imposing their own fully-realised version of the present. The problem at Everton isn’t hiring non-Everton managers. It’s hiring the wrong manager with no coherent plan in place. Wheeling out Rooney in succession to Rafa Benítez would be part of that same process of wild and panicky oscillation. And yet. Having said that. And with all due respect. Somehow it is also a brilliant and hugely seductive idea. The supporters would love it (and yes, this is actually the main thing). Neutrals would devour that product. And for all its shades of nostalgia this would also be a very current thing, an appointment based in the power of vibes, the sense that Rooney will “get Goodison rocking”, that there will be feelings, that authentic emotions will happen. The death of feeling, or at least its dilution, isn’t just an existential issue in football. It’s a commercial and practical one too. This is the basic point of sport, the reason it endures and succeeds. But it is also the part that has been taken for granted, stretched out, hammered thin. Is it endlessly elastic? Could we actually, you know, kill it? Derby have received a bid of about £28m from US-based Adam and Colin Binnie, the first formal offer for the Championship club since they entered administration in September.  Derby's administrator, Quantuma, is in a race against time to seal a deal after being asked by the English Football League to provide proof of funds, thought to be about £5m, for the remainder of the season by 1 February with the club at risk of liquidation.  The Binnies, founders of the private investment company Carlisle Capital, are based in New England.The Binnies are aware of potential additional liabilities that the club could face, which hinge on whether Middlesbrough or Wycombe are successful in their combined claims for about £50m in compensation.  Both clubs believe they lost out on revenue because Derby, who have been docked a total of 21 points this season, breached financial rules last season. The bid does not cover Derby's stadium, which is owned by the former club chairman Mel Morris, and it remains to be seen if other interested parties, such as the former Newcastle owner Mike Ashley, now come to the table.  Derby's manager, Wayne Rooney, reiterated that time is of the essence. ""The reality is we need someone in quick,"" he said. ""There are a few organisations interested in taking over."" Ben Fisher Hence the current obsession with “culture” at Manchester United, with whether the players actually care; the minute study of facial expression and body language, the pressing stats reeled off like forgotten birthday presents. See also the fetishising of Roy Keane in the TV pundit’s chair, where he acts as a kind of feelings-bludgeon, an avatar of ancient corrective rage, constructing a persona that brings to mind the kind of mass murderer who gets deluged with marriage proposals from strangers while he’s serving 200 years in a high-security prison because, you know, he seems so real. Say “bluffers” again, Roy. Say it. This is where the elite-level football product finds itself, shot through with a craving for something authentic, but menaced also by all those questions that seem increasingly hard to answer. What is the point, really, of trying to succeed as Everton Football Club? What is the point of a league where monied stasis is the goal of almost all of its members? How can I feel that deep connection to a diffuse global company sponsored by an unlicensed betting portal that secretly dreams of relocating to the metaverse? Perhaps this is why there is so much free-floating rage out there, the hunger to see bias and conspiracies, the obsession with trivia and celebrity, the skittish collectivism of the online herd. These are essentially ghost-feelings, reflexes, emotional muscle memory, like a dog kicking its legs in its sleep. And little wonder the market is so keen to plug this emotional void. Broadcasters love the heritage appointment, a legacy product that can be recycled and re-monetised. Stevie G goes to Old Trafford. Wow! Rooney versus Lampard. Imagine! And so football becomes a little more like the bit at the start of WWE where they talk for ages about how jazzed up they are, about how much this all means, and then a pointless, pre-scripted sporting contest happens. So yes, Rooney to Everton would be brilliant in so many ways. He has the basic goods for it. With any luck he might turn out to be that truly rare thing, a high-grade modern football manager in exactly the right role. In the meantime bring it on. Show me a bellowing face, a raised fist, an echo of something real. Give us all one last priapic spasm before the feelings go.",Sport/Football,Wayne Rooney to Everton may not make sense but it sounds seductively real | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/21/wayne-rooney-to-everton-may-not-make-sense-but-it-sounds-seductively-real
