2/22/2022,"Donald Trump is still trying to blame anyone but himself for his longtime accounting firm’s decision last week to sever ties with the Trump Organization. He insisted Sunday that the firm Mazars USA was “broken” by “Radical leftist racist prosecutors.” Trump offers no evidence for his accusations that the prosecutors are racist. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and state Attorney General Letitia James — who are both investigating Trump Organization business practices — are Black. Trump quoted Mazars’ statement that it “performed its work in accordance with professional standards.” But Mazars didn’t say the same about the Trump Organization. Mazars terminated its relationship, it explained in a letter that was part of a court document filed last week, because 10 years of financial statements it had prepared with records provided by the Trump Organization could no longer be considered reliable. It ducked out of its relationship with Trump as the attorney general investigates whether Trump inflated asset values to obtain bank loans and entice investors, and reduced values to lower tax bills Trump also claimed in his first, lengthy statement about Mazars’ defection last Tuesday that the company had been “threatened” and “intimidated” by James’ office to back away from his business. He went on at length to discuss his own company’s finances and financial practices. The statement complicated legal issues for him. Just the day before, his attorneys had argued that Trump knows virtually nothing about the financial details of his own company, and therefore, could hardly be held accountable for practices being investigated by James. James quickly fired off a letter to the judge presiding over her investigation about Trump’s first Mazars statement, noting that it flatly contradicted claims by his own attorneys. Clearly, Trump knows “exactly what OAG is investigating,” she wrote, referencing the Office of the Attorney General. Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron last Thursday ordered Trump and his children Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. to sit for depositions to answer questions under oath concerning the Trump Organization and James’ probe.

2/22/2022,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China is concerned about the ""worsening"" situation in Ukraine, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday, repeating his call for all parties to show restraint and resolve differences through dialogue. The legitimate security concerns of any country should be respected, Wang, who is also a Chinese state councillor, told U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on a phone call, according to a Chinese foreign ministry statement. Accelerating a crisis the West fears could spark a war, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday ordered the deployment of troops to two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine after recognising them as independent. Russia denies any plan to attack Ukraine but has threatened unspecified ""military-technical"" action unless it receives sweeping security guarantees including a promise that its neighbour will never join NATO. ""The situation in Ukraine is worsening,"" Wang told Blinken. ""China once again calls on all parties to exercise restraint."" China will continue to stay in touch with all parties, Wang said. On the call, Blinken underscored the need to preserve Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity amid Russia's ""aggression"", said Ned Price, a spokesperson at the U.S. State Department. Blinken also spoke with Wang about developments in North Korea, Price said in a brief statement. China calls for direct dialogue between the United States and North Korea, and will, as always, seek to play a constructive role in promoting the resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, Wang said. TAIWAN The United States should not include Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, in America's Indo-Pacific strategy, Wang told Blinken. Earlier this month, the United States said it would commit more diplomatic and security resources to the Indo-Pacific. Washington also said it would work with partners inside and outside the region to maintain peace and stability in the strait dividing Taiwan from China. The attempt to include Taiwan in the strategy to contain China is sending all the ""wrong signals"", Wang told Blinken on the call, according to the Chinese foreign ministry statement. Still, China is willing to manage its differences with the United States and stabilise bilateral ties, Wang said.
