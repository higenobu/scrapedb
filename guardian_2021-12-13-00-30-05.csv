12/13/2021,"Michael Cullen is nearing the end of his 2,000-mile Giving Back Tour to support groups that have helped him over the years. Better known as Speedo Mick because he wears only a pair of swimming trunks, Cullen is walking around the UK and Ireland to raise money for causes close to his heart such as homelessness, disadvantaged children and mental health. The weather has not been kind in recent weeks. He has had to battle storms Arwen and Barra in his journey across the north of England, and was almost swept out to sea in Morecambe.  “I’ve been in the Outer Hebrides, I’ve been in Scotland in -6C, and none of it beat me to put my clothes on – but it was Morecambe that put all the doubts in my mind,” Cullen said. “I nearly got blown off the seafront at Morecambe – me and [a statue of] Eric Morecambe nearly got blown away, it was that powerful and strong.” On Friday’s walk a rainbow, to match his multi-coloured scarf, provided a metaphor of hope for the lifelong Everton supporter, who has previously struggled with addiction, spent time on the streets and had mental health issues. His swimming cap has been replaced by a deerstalker and he runs to ensure he keeps warm in the worst conditions. Cullen has been spurred on by people who join him for legs of the walk and well-wishers at the side of the road, in addition to messages of support from the likes of Wayne Rooney. “A big funeral procession is going past and they all have their windows open, all beeping, all smiling, on a day when they are going to bury a loved one,” Cullen said as he walked near Chorley on Friday. “This is the power of these knickers. I know it sounds bizarre but it gives people relief, just a few moments to stop thinking about any worries. The best part of this is to see the smiles and laughing in the cars – it fills my world with joy.” The tour, which has taken Cullen from Stornoway in Scotland to Portsmouth via Donegal, will conclude in his home city of Liverpool next week. Cullen is well known for his fundraising, previously walking from Liverpool to Lyon, among other efforts. He has raised £126,760 during his current walk and given out £193,000 to 83 small charities across the UK and Ireland along the way from money previously donated. “I’ve been homeless, I’ve struggled with my mental health and addiction. I got the support I needed over 19 years ago. I am 19 years clean and sober, I’ve got my self-respect and dignity back … well I don’t know about my dignity,” Cullen said. “I’ve got my family and a roof over my head, I’ve got my life back and I am able to do this stuff. This is a dream come true. “I am trying to let people know that there is a way out. You can find the door. I couldn’t find the door … and I tried to take my life a couple times in those 20 years of addiction. I never had any hope. This is what the story is about, it’s about hope. Hope lives in the darkest places; you don’t think it’s there but it is.”",News/Society,‘Power of these knickers’: Speedo Mick nears last leg of UK charity walk,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/12/power-of-these-knickers-speedo-mick-nears-last-leg-of-uk-charity-walk
12/13/2021,"The Japanese composer Ichiko Aoba’s seventh record, the first to be released outside her country, offers a timely hidden door to another, quieter world. Drawing on her experience as a soundtracker of theatre productions and video games such as The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening, Windswept Adan finds Aoba moving beyond the simple voice-and-guitar arrangements of her previous releases to create, in collaboration with Taro Umebayashi, AKA Milk, a psych-folk sci-fi story set on Adan, a fictional island based on the Ryukyu archipelago. From Prologue, with its deep drone, wash of waves and circling, priestessly choral voices to the closing Adan no Shima no Tanjyosai and its sparsely plucked guitar and elegiac strings and flute, the album casts a still, soothing spell. Anyone charmed by the deep delicacy of Nick Drake, Joanna Newsom or Isobel Campbell’s the Gentle Waves will find many byways to wander, from the graceful Easter Lily, in which slow kalimba and guitar arpeggios build twinkling layers that shift subtly, revealing shadows, to Hagupit, an eerier, ghostlier thing with a keening melody. It’s a remarkable feat of musical world-building that will pull you back to Adan’s shores again and again.

12/13/2021,"Two weeks out from the Christmas break, and across the US the annual note from school PTAs reaches parents: it is time to recognise this year’s efforts by teachers through contributions to the holiday fund. It’s a solicitation that goes out every year, but this year the wording is particular. The past 12 months have been terrible, period, but particularly terrible for those working in schools. Please dig deep, we are advised; these are uniquely difficult times. It’s not only a whip-round but an invitation for thanks and praise that, in these endless, waning days of the pandemic, seems to belong to an earlier time. If we were frightened in 2020, there was also a sense of readjustment, much discussed, about what we owed to one another. There was a warm glow of mutual responsibility. Those taken for granted were lauded and rewarded. In New York, food delivery apps introduced a button for a 40% tip, and teachers and doctors were heroes. Nothing lasts, of course, but the collective sense of a near-death experience meant that – as many thought in the heat of the moment – some version of this gratitude would.  It didn’t, obviously. Over the past year, gratuities winnowed back to 20% and griping about school schedules resurfaced. What’s curious, perhaps, isn’t the return to business as usual, but a decisive swing from valorising certain groups to effectively demonising them. Last month, in some school districts in the US, school closures were announced not as responses to rising Covid numbers, but to accommodate teacher burnout. Detroit public schools decided that, until the end of the year, they would close their classrooms every Friday and revert to online learning. In Florida, the school holidays were extended. Seemingly on a dime, the mantra “teachers are great” flipped to “teachers don’t want to work”. People were furious. Part of this dynamic is just basic energy flow. It’s a feature of burnout that while one’s own is deeply felt and definitely real, other people are mostly faking it. The state of burnout erodes tolerance. To nurse one’s own bruised system relies on everyone else’s being up and running. No one has the bandwidth to accommodate the needs of others, particularly if they make one’s own life more difficult. There’s a question of association, too, perhaps. For a lot of people, school functionality is the single biggest barometer of where we are in the pandemic. Part-closures, teacher burnout, even solicitations for gratitude interfere with the sense that we are on the other side of this thing. No one wants to be reminded of the awful days of 2020, when our kids sat frozen for hours on Zoom. At every stage of the pandemic, there has been a second world war analogy waiting unhappily in the wings, and in this case it’s Churchill being voted out of office in 1945. According to the teaching unions in the US, reverting to a partly remote learning schedule is an effort to keep teachers from resigning. “What you hear from teachers is that it’s been too much,” Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, told the New York Times. “And they’re trying the best that they can.” It’s an appeal to reason that will get precisely nowhere with parents forced to scramble for childcare if their kids’ school suddenly shuts every Friday. Even without the practical implications of partial school closures – or indefinite mask mandates when all school-age kids in the US are vaccine-eligible – there is an emotional need served by pivoting to trashing those one latterly admired. A friend referred to it as “the pendulum of hate”, and I suppose if nothing else it’s a swing that falsely implies movement where there might actually be none. These people, once great, have now become tiresome, clinging to how things were when the rest of us have moved on. It’s not the pandemic itself holding us back, but the more absorbable problem of truculent teachers and inflexible unions – a question of perception, not reality. At this point, all that stands between us and the world as it was in 2019 is apparently a large dose of common sense and the exhortation to buck up. To think otherwise – to consider that we’re all in the same boat, burnt out, fed up and incapable of returning to anything – is simply too dismal a possibility to allow.

12/13/2021,"France has quietly dropped its threat of a trade war over post-Brexit access to fishing waters after the UK and Channel Islands governments agreed to issue 83 more operating licences before an EU deadline. The offer did not fully meet the demands of Emmanuel Macron’s government but Brussels and Paris signalled their satisfaction after a period of increasingly bellicose rhetoric.  It remains to be seen, however, whether French fishing communities will accept the decisions, with threats issued in recent days of a pre-Christmas blockade of UK goods entering Calais. On Sunday, the EU commissioner for fishing, Virginijus Sinkevičius, thanked the UK for “respecting” the 10 December deadline by which Paris had demanded additional licences to small boats seeking to fish in the coastal waters of the UK and Jersey and Guernsey, British Crown dependencies. He said: “I think it was a very important step achieved last night and I’m thankful to the UK that they respected a deadline that we set by 10 December “The two weeks were very intensive, we’ve managed to bring over 80 additional licences now. The [European] Commission together with the French authorities, we will examine every single application to see if there is sufficient sufficient data provided to gain licences. The UK always stated that they keep the doors open. So if there is a case, of course, the commission together with the French authorities will examine those possibilities.” Annick Girardin, the French ministers for the seas, said her government would seek to assist those fishers who had not been successful. A range of threats had been made by the French government in over an alleged failure to respect the trade agreement by providing sufficient small boats with fishing licences for the waters around the UK, Jersey and Guernsey. Downing Street had insisted that sufficient evidence proving that applicants had previously fished in the coastal waters had not been met. But Macron demanded a “gesture of goodwill” by midnight on 10 December. French ministers spoke of cutting energy supplies to Jersey and applying tariffs on UK trade. The latest threat had been to start the dispute process in the EU-UK trade agreement although there was a distinct lack of enthusiasm shown by the other key member states with fishing interests. The latest round of wrangling over individual licences went on past the French deadline but both sides appeared satisfied by the end of the talks. Following the provision of further evidence in recent days by French fishers, the UK issued 18 licences on Saturday for new vessels replacing boats that had previously operated in UK territorial waters, with a further seven expected to be given access on Monday. Five vessels previously issued temporary licences were also given permanent licences for Jersey’s waters An estimated 81 licence requests have not been granted but the UK has said it was willing to examine any new evidence. The commission has previously accepted that some applications had been “poor”.",News/Environment,France drops threat of trade war over post-Brexit fishing rights,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/12/france-drops-threat-of-trade-war-over-post-brexit-fishing-rights
12/13/2021,"Joe Biden has asked the US environmental protection agency (EPA) to investigate what role the climate crisis might have played in the deadly tornadoes that killed scores in Kentucky and several other states this weekend. Experts have said that tornadoes with such intensity are rare later in the year during colder seasonal weather, and that Friday night’s storms, which included one tornado tearing a path of more than 225 miles across Kentucky, appeared to be an anomaly.  In remarks on Saturday addressing the devastation, Biden said he wanted to know to what degree climate change might have been a contributory factor. “The specific impact on these specific storms, I can’t say at this point. I’m going to be asking the EPA and others to take a look at that,” the president said in an afternoon briefing in his home town of Wilmington, Delaware. “But the fact is that we know everything is more intense when the climate is warming. And obviously it has some impact here.” Climate analysts have long studied links between a rise in global temperatures and the increasing intensity of unseasonal severe weather events around the world, including more powerful hurricanes over longer seasonal spans, heatwaves and stronger and more widespread flooding and wildfires. In September, Richard Allan, a professor of climate science at University of Reading, and lead author of an alarming report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC), the world’s leading authority on climate science, warned that each fraction of a degree of warming was crucial. “You are promoting moderate extreme weather events to the premier league of extreme events [with further temperature rises],” he said. Experts in the US agree. Friday’s storm was: “One word: remarkable. Unbelievable would be another [word],” according to Victor Gensini, meteorology professor at Northern Illinois university. “It was really a late spring type of setup in the middle of December.” The Associated Press contributed reporting.",News/US news,Biden calls on EPA to investigate role of climate crisis in deadly tornadoes,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/12/kentucky-tornadoes-biden-epa-climate-crisis-role
12/13/2021,"Max Verstappen secured his first Formula One world championship with victory at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. After a tense and highly controversial season decider at Yas Marina he beat his title rival Lewis Hamilton into second on the very last lap of the season after the pair had gone into the race level on points. It was once more a straight head-to-head battle between the two at the front but where Verstappen and Red Bull proved to have the edge at the very death, leaving their rivals furious.  Verstappen’s first title comes in his seventh season in F1, although he is still only 24 years old. He is the first Dutchman to have won the F1 world championship. Having become the youngest driver in the history of the sport on his debut aged 17 in 2015, Verstappen has the potential to go on and win many more. He is a more mature, complete driver now, his youthful excesses largely curbed and his judgment more circumspect although he remains an aggressively confrontational driver, uncompromising with his elbows as Hamilton discovered this season. This year he has taken 10 wins, delivering some relentlessly confident and controlled drives for some dominant victories. That he did so on the first time he has been in a championship fight is hugely impressive. He was unbowed and unintimidated going up against the seven-time champion Hamilton, supremely confident in his own ability to do so. His appetite to race, to compete, is fierce and he will be expectant of adding more titles to his tally. Victory this year, his greatest achievement, was made all the moreremarkable such has been the level of competition from Hamilton who was competing at the top of his game in what has been his toughest fight of his career. Verstappen has had to weather a rollercoaster to bring it home. He lost a 32-point lead in the space of two races in Britain and Hungary but has fought back with relentless determination. Their relationship, initially one of mutual respect, has deteriorated as the intensity has grown and the accusations between teams have flown, growing increasingly fractious and has ended on similar notes in Abu Dhabi. This was a conflict fought on may fronts, a maelstrom with the two drivers locked in a battle of wills at its heart. Hamilton made an explosive start from second on the grid, grabbing the lead into turn one, despite being on the slower medium tyres. It was a mighty start but Verstappen immediately came back at him at the turn-six chicane and dived up the inside. Hamilton was squeezed off by the move and retained the lead by cutting the chicane to avoid contact. Verstappen believed he should give the place back, Hamilton was inevitably convinced he had been forced wide. It was the season’s turbulent battles in microcosm but the stewards decided no investigation was necessary, deeming Verstappen had forced Hamilton off and that Hamilton then backed off the lead he had gained. Red Bull were aggrieved and the move did seem a reasonable and bold attempt to pass. The issue being that consistency over similar decisions from the stewards has been lacking in recent races but racing continued. Hamilton opened up a two-second gap by lap eight as they settled into a rhythm leaving the rest of the field behind. Verstappen was struggling with his tyres and Hamilton took a 5sec lead on his more durable rubber. The Dutchman pitted on lap 14 to take the hard rubber and Mercedes matched the stop to avoid the undercut a lap later, also taking the hard tyres and he emerged still 5sec clear. Hamilton caught the leader, Red Bull’s Sergio Pérez who had yet to pit, on lap 20. Red Bull hoped the Mexican would hold him up and Pérez defended brilliantly through a series of corners, refusing to yield and coming back on Hamilton each time he passed. It was bravura, nail-biting stuff and Hamilton could not find a way through for over a lap. Finally he made it stick at turn six but Pérez had done the job as Verstappen closed to within 2sec of the leader. Yet the Mercedes race pace was formidable and Hamilton began once more eking out a lead of almost 4sec up by lap 27. Red Bull could not make an impression on the Mercedes with Hamilton comfortable out front. The virtual safety car was called on lap 35 and a lap later and Red Bull faced with making no inroads had to take the chance of pitting their man. Mercedes left Hamilton out to maintain track position, leaving the Dutchman with fresh tyres to attack for 20 laps. When racing resumed Hamilton had a lead of 17sec with Verstappen out to hunt him down after both teams had taken their final roll of the dice. Verstappen pushed hard and took some time out but Hamilton was able to maintain good pace despite his used rubber. The gap came down to 14sec by lap 43 but he was not clawing enough back. Yet in season marked by high drama there was one final twist. A late crash for Williams’s Nicholas Latifi brought the safety car out on lap 53. Red Bull immediately pitted Verstappen for fresh tyres but Mercedes left Hamilton out to once more maintain track position. Hamilton’s reaction was a stream of invective at his bad luck. Then with the FIA having announced lapped cars could not overtake to move them out of the way, they gave the cars between Hamilton and Verstappen permission to do so – a very controversial decision. It left one lap of racing on the restart, a sudden-death single-lap shootout between the pair and Verstappen’s fresh tyres paid off as he passed for the lead at turn five to take the place and the win. Hamilton tried to come back at him but was left disconsolate with his team feeling they had been hard done by.",Sport/Sport,Max Verstappen beats Lewis Hamilton to F1 world title on last lap in Abu Dhabi,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/12/f1-max-verstappen-wins-abu-dhabi-gp-lewis-hamilton
12/13/2021,"Introducing criminal sanctions for tech executives in the online safety bill could be copied by non-democratic regimes, the industry has claimed before an influential report this week. A joint committee of MPs and peers scrutinising the bill will publish its findings on Tuesday after the culture secretary promised to accelerate provisions for criminal liability for senior managers.  Nadine Dorries said it was “nonsense” that tech firms would be given a two-year grace period before criminal accountability is introduced. Instead, liability would be brought in within three to six months of the bill becoming law, she said. In an example of the industry counter-offensive, the British trade body techUK said criminal sanctions could provide a “pretext” for non-democratic regimes to introduce punitive measures based on the legislation. Antony Walker, the deputy chief executive of techUK, said: “There are examples around the world in non-democratic regimes where threats to senior executives have been used as a way to force companies in a way that suits a particular government. The UK has an opportunity to set an example whereby we don’t provide those pretexts for other regimes to simply say: ‘Well if the UK does it, that’s the gold standard. We’re going to do it too but then apply a somewhat different standard.’” Twitter has issued a similar warning. Speaking to the joint committee in October, the social media company’s director of public policy strategy, Nick Pickles, said “hostage laws” – so called because they could be used to get at companies by pressuring staff members – could be adopted by illiberal regimes. In its submission to the committee, Google said the criminal sanctions threat would encourage directors to remove content “at scale” rather than risk falling foul of the act. Dorries told the committee that failure to tackle harmful algorithms – which tailor an internet user’s experience and could steer them down content “rabbit holes” – could result in charges being brought against executives. “Remove your harmful algorithms today and you will not be subjected – named individuals – to criminal liability and prosecution.” Under the bill, senior managers face a fine or up to two years in jail if they fail to comply with “information requests” from Ofcom, the communications watchdog that will oversee it. According to the draft bill, a criminal offence will be committed if an executive fails to comply with an information request from Ofcom, or if the response is materially false or encrypted. Supporters of the bill believe the clauses are broad enough to force tech companies to follow the act closely. However, lawyers at Harbottle & Lewis said the government memo on the deferred powers was focused on information offences and they did not “see anything in the memo that suggests liability could extend to other breaches of the act”. Dorries has said she will look at the committee’s recommendations “very seriously”, with several issues under debate including bringing fraudulent adverts under the scope of the bill and introducing tougher child protection measures such as stringent age verification. The online safety bill applies to companies that host user-generated content, covering services from social media networks to video sharing sites. It places a duty of care on those companies to protect users from harmful content, or face substantial fines levied by Ofcom. The duty of care is split into three parts: preventing the proliferation of illegal content and activity such as child abuse images, terrorist material and hate crimes such as racial abuse; ensuring children are not exposed to harmful or inappropriate content; and, for tech firms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, ensuring adults are protected from legal but harmful content. The latter content category is to be defined by the culture secretary, after consultation with Ofcom, and then scrutinised by parliament before being enacted in secondary legislation.
