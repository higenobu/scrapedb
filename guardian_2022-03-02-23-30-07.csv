3/2/2022,"Thousands of Ukrainians have volunteered to defend their country and to fight Russia’s invasion, with recruits including IT workers and builders taking part in basic training before setting off for battle. The volunteer centre in Lviv was packed on Wednesday with new soldiers who had signed up to join territorial defence units. Some were in military uniform. Others wore civilian clothes and baseball hats and carried shiny backpacks. They lined up for the first time in a street on Taras Shevchenko Avenue, named after Ukraine’s national poet. “Raise your hand if you have a car,” their new commander barked. The recruits divided into groups and introduced themselves. Around them snow fell. “History is happening right now. I don’t want to be on the sidelines,” Vitali, the 35-year-old boss of a Lviv startup said, speaking an assembly point. “I want to make history. Finally the world should know what is evil and what is good. We have the whole world’s support.” He added: “The main reason we are going to win is because of people.” What was his message for Vladimir Putin? “I don’t negotiate with terrorists,” he said. “He is going to die soon. His regime will fall into dust.” Vitali said he and his company’s 15 employees had begun weapons training five days before Russia’s attack. He had volunteered the day of the invasion. The recruits were going to learn combat first aid and other skills at an undisclosed location outside the city, he said. With Kharkiv and Kyiv under brutal bombardment and the Ukrainian army encircled in the city of Mariupol, volunteers from western Ukraine are being brought in as reinforcements. Some fought in 2014 against Russian-armed separatists in the eastern Donbas region, when Putin annexed Crimea. Others were still at school at the time. “There are 17- and 18-year-olds today ready to lay down their lives for Ukraine. They say: ‘We will die for Lviv’,” Bogdan Matsuk, 22, said. “I’m fighting for my home. I was born here … I think all Russians will be killed,” he added. Matsuk was one of several volunteers with international connections. He spent his childhood in Texas before returning to Lviv aged 14. Were his parents – who are in the US – worried? “No. They are happy for me. They are saying: ‘It’s your decision’”, he replied. He added: “Putin thought Ukraine was weak. He speaks dumb shit”. Across Ukraine, citizens have aided the war effort in multifarious ways. Grandmothers are cooking borscht and giving it to refugees fleeing west to Poland, creatives are making molotov cocktails in Lviv basements and chill lounges, and affluent businessmen are buying up drones and kevlar vests. Alex Riabchyn, a former deputy in Ukraine’s parliament and an adviser to the CEO of the state gas firm Naftogaz, said volunteers were playing a crucial part in the struggle for the nation’s survival. “We have a series of strong horizontal links. We are good at self-organisation,” he explained. He continued: “Russia has vertical links and strong institutions. Putin says something; Russians obey. In Ukraine institutions are weak. We are not used to obeying. The state killed people in the Holocaust and the gulags. People here rely on their family and friends.” Riabychin said civil society was enjoying an unprecedented moment, with collaborative networks formed on Telegram and WhatsApp. The spirit and “fellowship” of the Maidan – the 2014 uprising against Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine’s corrupt pro-Russian president – had spread across the country, he said. “We are a huge amount of ants,” he added, saying Ukrainians were united like never before. “Previously we had differences. There are no divisions,” he said. The country’s president, Volodymr Zelenskiy, made the same point about unity in a video address on Wednesday. But could Ukraine prevail against a ruthless foe? “We are prepared for a long siege. It’s impossible to surrender. You can decapitate the government or president but you can’t defeat the nation. Russia has miscalculated.” The volunteers’ commander made a rousing speech mentioning anti-tank missiles and stingers, supplied by the UK, US and other western countries. He referred to the enemy as Moskali – a derogatory Ukrainian term for Russians. “Glory to Ukraine!” he shouted. “To the heroes, glory!,” the recruits roared back. They clambered into cars and set off in convoy to a secret destination. Vitali’s Nissan SUV had a wooden pole sticking out of the front right window adorned with a blue and yellow Ukrainian flag. One person left behind at volunteer HQ was Alex, a 24-year-old builder. Some soldiers had to stay in the city, Ukraine’s sixth biggest, he said, in case the Russians tried to do a sneak attack. Alex said he had spent six years working and living in Wrocław in western Poland. He came back as soon as the Russian onslaught began. “We are a strong country. And we have outside help. Putin has united us,” he said, adding that expatriate Ukrainians were returning in droves to defend their home. His senior officer beckoned him away. Could the officer talk? “Sorry, no time,” he replied.",News/World news,‘We are a huge amount of ants’: the united front of Ukrainian volunteers,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/ukrainian-volunteers-united-front-against-russia-invasion
3/2/2022,"San Francisco has long been a creative incubator and cultural melting pot – a catalyst for social change, technological innovation and good times. It’s also a must-visit for anyone considering a Californian road trip, or indeed any great American road trip – after all, it was repeatedly visited by Sal Paradise in Jack Kerouac’s seminal On the Road. This ravishingly beautiful bay city was home to the beat generation of writers that Kerouac spearheaded in the 1950s, the birthplace of the counterculture and hippie movement of the late 1960s and 1970s, and fertile ground for the jazz, rock and experimental music scenes, in the bars of Haight-Ashbury. And despite the city’s countless historic charms, including the Golden Gate Bridge, crooked and colourful Victorian-era homes, and cable cars tracing the slopes of some of the city’s 48 hills, this fiercely progressive and fun-loving city continues to innovate and inspire, with a groundbreaking farm-to-table restaurant scene, vibrant street art and palpable progressive vibe. Top: City Lights bookstore. Below: manager Elaine Katzenberger 1 City Lights bookstoreHead to the North Beach neighbourhood to check out City Lights bookstore and neighbouring Vesuvio Cafe. The area has been a hub of bohemian and artistic creativity since the beat writers made it their home in the 1950s. Poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti founded City Lights in 1953 as a literary meeting-place, paperback bookstore and publishing house. Thirty years ago, Elaine Katzenberger was working in Vesuvio Cafe when she was offered a job at the bookstore across the way, and she describes her first day at City Lights as “like stepping into just the right temperature bath water”. Today, Katzenberger runs the three-storey bookstore and oversees the publishing wing, the imprint that first published Allen Ginsberg’s Howl and Other Poems. To her mind, books and bookstores are more important than ever now. “Social change happens when people are inspired and motivated to act, and when they feel connected to one another,” she says. “A bookstore is where people come to intentionally share space with books and with each other, and to me bookstores are akin to a place of worship, providing a sense of home, inspiration, motivation, and a sense of being part of a community of like-minded souls, even for just an afternoon.” The Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory. 2 Golden Gate Fortune Cookie FactoryFirst-time visitors arrive in San Francisco knowing about the bridge and the bay, but they leave knowing the city as a cluster of communities, each neighbourhood with its own distinct flavour and heritage. San Francisco’s Chinatown is the largest Chinatown outside Asia, and the oldest Chinatown in North America. And since 1962, the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory has been making custom cookies by hand, and offering visitors tours of the factory; today they hand-bake 10,000 fortune cookies a day, on a cast iron rotating griddle wheel. “You can’t visit San Francisco without coming to Chinatown,” says owner Kevin Chan. “And a visit to the fortune cookie factory is a really uplifting experience, because fortune cookies are all about joy, hope and sharing experiences with friends and family. There is a real appetite for this right now. The pandemic has been tough on all hospitality businesses, but San Francisco is resilient, and it’s been good to see travellers return, and businesses come back to life. We’re really happy to be back to doing what we do best, baking cookies for local restaurants, customers and visitors from all over the world.” The GLBT Historical Society Muesum 3 The GLBT Historical Society Museum and ArchivesFriendly, fabulous and full of historical clout, the Castro District is one of the liveliest neighbourhoods in San Francisco, a welcoming gay neighbourhood where indie galleries, high-energy gay bars and top-notch organic restaurants line the streets. It’s impossible to really understand San Francisco’s progressive spirit without visiting this progressive yet party-loving neighbourhood, where rainbow flags fly proudly, spontaneous street celebrations regularly erupt outside iconic gay bars such as the Twin Peaks Tavern, and the GLBT Historical Society covers more than 100 years of the Bay Area’s queer heritage, as the US’s first dedicated museum to LGBTQ+ history. “The museum represents our collective history while emphasising the multifaceted, yet wonderfully mundane stories about LGBTQ people, places and legendary moments that are often untold or intentionally left out of history, and urgently need to be shared and celebrated,” says Nalini Elias, director of exhibitions and museum experience. There are a lot of stories to be told; the Castro is where one of San Francisco’s most cherished icons, Harvey Milk, was elected as city supervisor in 1977, making him the first openly gay elected official in California. Milk’s assassination in 1978 alongside the mayor of San Francisco, George Moscone, made him a martyr in the gay community, and his political legacy, centring on the importance of neighbourhoods, small businesses and gay liberation, is still keenly felt today. “The GLBT museum is truly a must-see if you want to be immersed in San Francisco’s history, and of course LGBTQ history and culture,” says Elias. Haight-Ashbury 4 Haight-AshburyIn the 1960s, the Haight district, a colourful but dilapidated cluster of Victorian townhouses known as Painted Ladies, was a melting pot of beat poets who’d been unceremoniously priced out of North Beach, members of the LGBTQ+ community spreading over from the Castro District, politically impassioned Berkeley students and other magnificent misfits – including musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead. The history of the 1960s counterculture movement is so densely concentrated in these streets that a walking tour by San Francisco City Guides is a useful way to get a handle on this colourful chapter of San Francisco’s history, and get the rock’n’roll gossip on the fetching pink property that once housed Janis Joplin, and the Grateful Dead House at 710 Ashbury. Today, bookstores such as The Booksmith, Magnolia Brewing (formerly the Drugstore Cafe, an original hippie hangout) and Amoeba Music carry on waving the counterculture flag. Top: The Ferry Building. Below: Alex Mart of Stonehouse Olive Oil 5 Ferry Building MarketplaceLongtime San Francisco residents joke that the best thing to come out of the 1989 earthquake was the repurposing of the Ferry Building, a grandiose but disused transit hub. The ferries were reintroduced, the 1892 beaux-arts building was restored, and the ground floor was filled with some 50 restaurants, vendors and shops, all with a focus on local and sustainable independent businesses. The twice-weekly farmers’ markets on Wednesdays and Saturdays keep things produce-based amid hot-ticket eateries such as the Vietnamese Slanted Door, but there is always a community feel at the Ferry Building. “We love being here because the Ferry Building is a beautiful long-standing piece of San Francisco history, alive with what this city is all about – fabulous food, small businesses and picturesque views,” says Alex Mart of Stonehouse Olive Oil, an award-winning female-owned business with a focus on sustainability and regenerative farming. “You can grab a world-famous croissant or empanada with an artisan coffee, sit by the water with an epic vista of the Bay Bridge and Treasure Island, with a new book from an independent bookstore. Then you can hop on a ferry, and swing back after a day of sightseeing for a dinner of fresh seafood and to score some locally made olive oil, ceramics or other souvenirs.” Book your San Francisco trip with British Airways",What if ... in California,If you’re going to San Francisco … be sure to visit these five not-to-be-missed sights,https://www.theguardian.com/what-if-in-california/2022/mar/02/if-youre-going-to-san-francisco-be-sure-to-visit-these-five-not-to-be-missed-sights
3/2/2022,"Police have said it was an “absolute miracle” that a 15-year-old girl survived after she was shot in a hail of bullets at a bus stop in Liverpool. The teenager is in a serious but stable condition in hospital following the “cowardly” drive-by shooting in the Toxteth area of the city on Tuesday, detectives said. The girl had finished school and is believed to have been standing at a bus stop on Upper Warwick Street when she was struck in the upper body shortly after 5pm. A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. A second man, in his 60s, has been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. Detectives on Wednesday urged motorists in the area to come forward with any dashcam footage potentially showing men in dark clothing riding electric bikes. The offenders are believed to have been wearing balaclavas or masks. Det Ch Supt Mark Kameen said the teenager suffered a gunshot wound to her upper body and was taken to hospital in a critical condition. He said it was an “absolute miracle and a credit to the NHS” that she survived. In a press conference at Merseyside police headquarters, detectives said they believed more than one offender was involved and that about four electric bikes may have been in use at the time. They said the attackers, who fired multiple shots, made off towards North Hill Street and the Princes Road area. Upper Warwick street, where the shooting took place, is a busy road with shops, businesses, residential addresses and a large youth centre. The bus stop is overlooked by a three-floor block of flats and opposite a community hub. A short time after police were called to the Toxteth shooting, a 21-year-old man arrived at hospital with a gunshot wound to his hand. Detectives said they believed that the two incidents were connected, but were keeping an open mind. Kameen said: “It is still, and I have to reassure everyone, very early days in this investigation, however we are working incredibly hard, late into the night and from the early hours of the morning to ensure that this investigation has the absolute traction that it definitely requires.” Police were making house-to-house inquiries and CCTV was being checked, the force said in a statement.

3/2/2022,"German chancellor Olaf Scholz ambushed his own party and coalition partners when he announced a historic 180 degree policy turn on defence spending and exporting lethal weapons, but for now he seems to be riding a wave of broad public support. In a speech in front of the Bundestag on Sunday, Scholz crossed several red lines held by his own party within under half an hour, when he announced that Germany would send missiles and anti-tank weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression and set up a special €100bn fund to modernise its own forces. “A turning point in the history of our continent” called for an appropriate response, he said. While the size of the one-off “special fund” for Germany’s military was brokered with his finance minister, Christian Lindner, of the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), sources quoted in German media say Scholz left his Green Party coalition partners in the dark as to the amount of the defence budget boost. Scholz’s allies, meanwhile, are briefing that Green ministers were informed of the exact amount but preferred to feign ignorance, in an attempt to save face as an environmental party borne out of a protest movement against the cold war arms race. But the chancellor’s announcement also took by surprise ministers from his own centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), which still campaigned against increasing military spending and meeting Nato’s 2% spending target as recently as 2017. In a TV interview on Tuesday night, interior minister Nancy Faeser could not confirm she had been informed of the size of the new fund beforehand. “There was very little consultation”, she said. According to Der Spiegel, a manuscript of Scholz’s speech was handed out to parliamentary leaders of all parties apart from the far-right AfD only shortly before the start of the special session in the Bundestag, allowing some politicians to adjust their speeches but not inform all their delegates. What may have amounted to a betrayal and a government crisis at other points in history has been largely smoothed over by the three coalition partners in Germany’s “traffic light” coalition, however, as the urgency of the war in Ukraine has pushed the government to show a united front. Green foreign minister Annalena Baerbock backed up Scholz’s rhetoric of an epochal change in German foreign policy when she spoke in front of the UN on Tuesday night: “When our peaceful order is being attacked, we need to face up to this new reality”, she said. For now, Scholz’s call to rethink Germany’s reluctance on military matters also appears to enjoy the support of society at large. A survey by pollster Forsa showed 78% of respondents in favour of both exporting lethal weapons to Ukraine and boosting the Bundeswehr with a new fund. So far, only the Greens’ youth group and a group of backbenchers in Scholz’s own party have indicated their resistance to the government’s military spending plans. The co-leader of the Green Youth movement said the volte face had taken place “without any political or social debate”, while a paper by the SPD’s Forum Democratic Left group cited by Der Spiegel objected to the spending plans on the grounds that Germany’s military was not under-funded but mismanaged. “The Bundeswehr has to be reformed, not geared up”, the paper said. In 2021, Germany recorded a defence budget of €53bn, the seventh highest in the world and a national record high. Supporters of the new fund say it is vital to allow for long-term procurement projects that are prone to delays and are impossible to facilitate through annual budgets alone. In his speech on Sunday, Scholz indicated that a large part of the new fund would be allocated towards building a successor to the German military’s outmoded Tornado fighter jets, as well as new transport helicopters and munitions.",News/World news,Germany unites behind chancellor’s U-turn on arming Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/germany-unites-behind-chancellor-olaf-scholz-u-turn-on-arming-ukraine-russia
3/2/2022,"The prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague announced this week that he would launch an investigation into possible war crimes or crimes against humanity in Ukraine. How likely are Putin or other Russian political or military leaders to be brought to justice and what are the obstacles that must be overcome for that to happen? There are four offences that the ICC prosecutes: war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and the crime of aggression. The ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said there was a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity had been committed in Ukraine. War crimes include wilful killing, wilfully causing great suffering, extensive destruction, and appropriation of property, as well as intentionally targeting civilian population or objects. Crimes against humanity include murder “committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population”. Khan said that as Ukraine was not a party to the Rome statute that established the ICC, it could not refer the alleged crimes itself, but it had twice previously accepted the court’s jurisdiction, including when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, and on the second occasion it had accepted jurisdiction “on an open-ended basis”. So Ukraine cannot refer the alleged crimes itself but the ICC does have jurisdiction over crimes committed on its territory. Russia withdrew from the ICC in 2016 after the court published a report classifying the Russian annexation of Crimea as an occupation. On the face of it, proving Russia has committed the crime of aggression would appear straightforward. The definition includes invasion of another state, bombardment and blockade of ports. However, if a state is not a party to the ICC, its individuals cannot be prosecuted by the court for this specific offence. The only exception is that the UN security council can refer a non-party to the ICC for the crime of aggression, but Russia, as a permanent member of the council, holds a veto, so this will not happen. But there is no similar bar that would prevent charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide being brought against a non-signatory such as Russia. It is much more difficult to link a political leader directly to offences committed by armed forces on the grounds – as required for these two offences – than it is to do so for the more overarching offence of crime of aggression. Even if Putin were charged, he would have to be arrested in a state that – unlike Russia – accepts the jurisdiction of the court. National courts can prosecute individuals irrespective of their nationality and where an offence has been committed if they have in place so-called universal jurisdiction laws. For example, in January a German court sentenced a Syrian former intelligence officer to life in prison for crimes against humanity committed in the Middle Eastern country’s civil war. In 2015, again in Germany, two Rwandan men accused of leading a rebel group in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo were jailed for war crimes. Even Russia has universal jurisdiction laws. However, even if there was an attempt to invoke universal jurisdiction for another head of state, there would still the sizeable obstacle of arresting Putin and bringing him to trial. This would probably require him to be removed from office and then extradited by a new Russian regime with more cordial relations with the international community. Prof Philippe Sands QC, the director of the UCL Project on International Courts and Tribunals, has called for the creation of a dedicated international criminal tribunal to investigate Putin and his acolytes for the crime of aggression, which he believes is the offence most befitting Russia’s acts in Ukraine. Ukraine has also taken Russia to the international court of justice (ICJ) for having launched an invasion on the pretext of false claims of genocide perpetrated against the country’s Russian speakers, although this has been described as a symbolic move owing to doubts about its jurisdiction.",News/World news,Could the international criminal court bring Putin to justice over Ukraine?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/could-international-criminal-court-bring-putin-to-justice-over-ukraine
3/2/2022,"A book of unpalatable truths about Britain’s slave trade has become a UK bestseller, almost 80 years after author Eric Williams was told by a British publisher: “I would never publish such a book, for it would be contrary to the British tradition.” Capitalism and Slavery was first published in the US in 1944, and although it was briefly printed in the UK 20 years later by André Deutsch, it has remained largely out of print here ever since. Published in a mass-market edition for the first time in the UK by Penguin Random House this week, it has sold what the publisher calls an “astonishing” almost 3,000 copies in its first few days and will appear at No 5 in the Sunday Times paperback non-fiction chart this weekend. The contentious core of the book by Williams – who was the first prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago for 25 years until his death in 1981 – was that the abolition of the slave trade was not born out of humanitarian wishes but of economic necessity. His thesis was that slavery just became economically unviable, and that the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 was driven more by the Industrial Revolution changing the way that Britain did business rather than any moral desire to stop the practice of slavery in its colonies. Britain’s role in the slave trade has come under fresh scrutiny in the last couple of years, with organisations such as the National Trust publishing reports into the links between many of the historic properties and stately homes it manages and profits made on the back of slavery in the Caribbean. And a new generation of activism has seen events such as the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol being toppled by protesters in 2020. Chloe Currens, the UK editor of Williams’s book for Penguin, said on Wednesday: “The publication of Capitalism and Slavery represented a watershed moment in the historiography of empire; it has proven to be a true classic among historians. We’re so excited to see its vital, urgent analysis reach a new generation of readers almost 60 years after it was first released in the UK.” Although virtually unknown in the UK, Capitalism and Slavery has never been out of print in the US since its first publication by the University of North Carolina Press. It is now on its third edition and between that and the second edition, just a few years ago, has sold 40,000 copies. While studying at Oxford, Williams, who was born in Trinidad and Tobago in 1911, wrote his thesis on the subject. That formed the basis of Capitalism and Slavery. He took it to Fredric Warburg, a leading publisher of revolutionary texts who had put out all of Stalin’s and Trotsky’s works. Warburg categorically refused. “Mr. Williams,” he said, “are you trying to tell me that the slave trade and slavery were abolished for economic and not for humanitarian reasons? I would never publish such a book, for it would be contrary to the British tradition.” For Williams’ daughter, Erica Williams Connell, the British publication of Capitalism and Slavery is an “incredible” moment. Williams Connell is the founding curator of the Eric Williams Memorial Collection Research Library, Archives and Museum at the University of the West Indies in Trinidad and Tobago. Speaking from her home in Miami, Florida, she said, “To think that almost 80 years after it was published, Britain is finally discovering Capitalism and Slavery is amazing to me. “Everyone who has heard about the book finally being re-published in the UK has said the same thing to me: well, it’s about time!” There have been many rebuttals and affirmations of what has become known the Williams Thesis since it was first published in 1944, and in answer to these, Williams Connell quoted from the foreword of the recent third edition, by William Darity of Duke University in North Carolina, who wrote: “Although scholars of the British Industrial Revolution generally have ignored Williams’s proposition, they only can continue to do so by placing their own intellectual integrity at peril.” While prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, Williams was the only head of state of the British former colonies that gained independence after 1950 to refuse the UK’s “golden handshake” of money – which could only be spent on British-made goods – which Williams said was insufficient reparation and the strings-attached deal insulting. He said in a speech to the London School of Economics in 1962: “The West Indies are in the position of an orange. The British have sucked it dry and their sole concern today is that they should not slip and get damaged on the peel … The offer is quite unacceptable and we would prefer not to have it … it amounted to aid to Britain rather than to Trinidad … I do not propose to accept any concept of the Commonwealth which means common wealth for Britain and common poverty for us.” His daughter described how a letter he wrote to that effect “dropped like a bomb in 10 Downing Street”. Williams Connell added: “The battle lasted a full year, and he eventually capitulated, but not without becoming a giant thorn in the British backside!”  Capital and Slavery by Eric Williams is published by Penguin Modern Classics (£9.99).

3/2/2022,"West Ham could be prevented from paying CSKA Moscow the next instalment of their transfer fee for Nikola Vlasic as a result of the UK government imposing sanctions against Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. CSKA sold Vlasic to West Ham for £25.7m last summer and the next instalment on the fee is due in August. However West Ham are unsure whether they will be allowed to make the next payment because sanctions could stop English clubs from dealing with Russian sides. Transfer fees are routinely spread out over 24 months rather than paid in one lump sum, but the economic action taken against Russia will have an effect on football. It is unclear how CSKA would react in the event of a non-payment. In normal circumstances a club who did not receive a scheduled payment would report the issue to Fifa. The Football Association regards the non-payment of transfer fees as primarily for Fifa and expects clubs to comply with government-imposed sanctions. Fifa has been approached for comment.

3/2/2022,"Keir Starmer has questioned why Roman Abramovich has not faced UK sanctions over the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as Boris Johnson appeared to accept a Labour offer to strengthen a new bill cracking down on illicit assets. At a prime minister’s questions that began with the rare sight of MPs standing in unison to applaud the Ukrainian ambassador, Vadym Prystaiko, who was watching from the public gallery, Starmer repeatedly called for tougher action against Russian oligarchs. He began by citing comments made to the Commons last week by the Labour MP Chris Bryant, who referred to what he said was a leaked Home Office document that accused Abramovich, the Chelsea football club owner, of having links to the Russian state as well as to “corrupt activity and practices”. The Labour leader said: “Last week the prime minister said that Abramovich was facing sanctions. He later corrected the record to say that he isn’t. Well, why on earth isn’t he?” After Johnson said he could not comment on individual cases, Starmer also called for action against Igor Shuvalov, formerly Vladimir Putin’s deputy prime minister, describing him as being among a group to have “dipped their hands in the blood of Putin’s war”. Noting that Shuvalov owns two flats in London through a company, Starmer said the only reason the real owner was known was because it was revealed by Alexei Navalny, the detained Russian dissident. “Transparency is essential to rooting out corruption,” Starmer said. “It should be built into our law, but it’s not. And I’m ashamed that we only know about Shuvalov’s Westminster flats because a dissident risked his life. Is the prime minister?” He called for tougher measures to be added to the government’s economic crimes bill, to be debated on Monday, and queried why a new register of property ownership would not apply to existing owners for 18 months. “Why are we giving Putin’s cronies 18 months to quietly launder their money out of the UK property market and into another safe haven?” Starmer asked. He also called for the bill to speed up previously mooted changes to tighten companies’ records: “Will the prime minister work with us to amend the bill, on Monday, to include the most basic reforms, like identity checks for directors?” Johnson defended what the government had done so far in terms of sanctions against Russia and those associated with it, saying: “The squeeze is growing and will continue to grow.” He said: “The whole house should be proud of what we have done. We have led the way on Swift, we have led the way on Aeroflot, we have led the way on freezing assets of banks.” He hinted he was willing to work with Starmer to help “whip aside the veil of anonymity” over who owned assets in the UK. “I’m delighted by the support that the right honourable gentleman is offering,” Johnson said. “If we can work together to make sure that we strengthen and accelerate the package, all the better.” Starmer said he would table relevant amendments for Monday, adding: “I am very pleased we can show that unity with the ambassador here watching us.” The prime minister said the government was preparing to publish “a full list of all those associated with the Putin regime”. However, speaking afterwards, Johnson’s official spokesperson was unable to give details of when such a list might be published. “Where possible we will publish further details so the public can see where we believe there are individuals who are benefiting from the regime.” He said a “significant proportion” of those on the list would probably end up facing sanctions.",News/World news,Starmer questions why Roman Abramovich is not facing UK sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/keir-starmer-questions-why-roman-abramovich-not-facing-uk-sanctions-russia-ukraine
3/2/2022,"Before meeting the investigative journalists behind the New York Times podcast The Trojan Horse Affair, I had dinner with some friends. “Trojan Horse?” asked one. “Wasn’t that the thing about the Islamist plot in schools?” He was partly right. In late 2013 (the same year as the horrific murder of Lee Rigby, when Islamic State was on the march), a mysterious letter was sent to Birmingham city council alleging a plot to infiltrate ordinary state schools and run them along Islamist lines. The government responded swiftly. Led by Michael Gove, the education secretary at the time, it launched an investigation, which was followed by an avalanche of allegations, resignations and disciplinary procedures, including lifetime professional bans for some teachers. For most people, the story ended there. Some readers, however, may recall that the original letter was widely believed to be a hoax. For one journalism student, Hamza Syed, a British Muslim from nearby Dudley, that mattered. “The story has always been told in a way where the letter matters because of the stuff that came afterwards,” says Syed over a video call from New York. “I was struggling with that.” The Trojan Horse Affair (which was co-produced by the true-crime hit maker Serial) aims to reveal who wrote the letter and why. Syed and the US journalist Brian Reed quickly land on a suspect – and a surprising motive – and suggest the letter that sparked such uproar and policy shifts may have not just been a hoax, but have had its roots in an internal dispute at one school. It is clever storytelling: dense, in terms of the sheer volume of information, and gripping, with Netflix-like cliffhangers. I got through the first six episodes in a day. The rest of the series focuses on whether there really was an Islamist plot to take over schools in Birmingham. It questions whether the issues that were eventually uncovered – genuine problems that urgently needed review – justified the scale and nature of the political response (one investigation was run by a former police lead on counter-terrorism) and tries to answer whether the response spoke to a wider prejudice and bias against Muslims. It looks at how many Muslims in Birmingham felt their community had been tarnished, despite some of the most sensational allegations – including that extremist propaganda videos were being shown in schools – turning out to be false. In one significant part of the podcast, former pupils tell of their fear of guilt by association, and that listing their school will negatively affect their university applications. It is not the only reporting to question the mainstream narrative about the scandal (including in this newspaper), but it feels a necessary counterpoint to the ocean of sensationalist headlines that cemented the affair in the public consciousness as “the Islamist plot in schools”. The first time I speak to Reed and Syed, the podcast has been out for only a day, but has already shot to the top of the US Apple podcast charts (it is still at No 3). For Reed, this is familiar territory. His previous podcast, S-Town, flew in at No 1 when it was released in 2017. Like S-Town – which started as an investigation into corruption in an Alabama town and finished as a touching portrait of smalltown America – The Trojan Horse Affair begins as a whodunnit and ends elsewhere. It paints a troubling (if contested) portrait of British Islamophobia, in which Muslim communities are seen by the government and much of the press primarily through a security lens – so much so that a frankly bananas-sounding fake letter could spark nationwide panic. But, says Reed, making the two podcasts could not have been more different. “S-Town was an embarrassment of riches in terms of people talking,” says Reed. “They were unabashed, openly telling their stories. This is more like traditional investigative journalism, where people don’t want to talk and where we’re relying on documents to tell the story.” One document in particular – an audit report that suggests government officials knew the letter was fake – took well over a year to track down, despite numerous freedom of information requests. “It’s been a really eye-opening experience, reporting from Britain,” says Reed. “I did not realise how much I’d miss the first amendment.” The podcast starts with the student journalist Syed meeting by chance the veteran Reed and telling him about the Trojan Horse letter. Did Syed pick a US reporter because he wanted a fresh pair of eyes? Or, as some have said on social media, because he feared the British press were too biased? Neither, says Syed. His plan was just to do the story for his graduate project; he was asking Reed for tips on whom to speak to first. “But before I even got to that question, he’d already jumped in and said it’s a really good story and he might want to look into this with me,” he says. Reed says that if S-Town had a genre, it was “southern gothic”, while The Trojan Horse Affair would be “detective”. But it could also be a buddy movie. With no heroes in the podcast, the listener becomes invested instead in Syed and Reed’s burgeoning closeness. We listen in as the two talk, work, challenge each other and joke – and smoke shishas together. “A friend of mine asked me: ‘How do you feel now the podcast is over, because now you and Brian can just be friends?’” recalls Syed. “And I thought: ‘We’ve been friends for a while.’” Reed says: “When we started, we were strangers, so we have a recording of our friendship development.” Reed guides and occasionally chastises Syed, who has good instincts, but a bit of a temper. We also hear Syed’s anguish at how many Muslims who were in no way involved in Trojan Horse felt their lives had been changed by it. At the time of the Trojan Horse affair, I was working in a school in a predominantly BAME, low-income area, helping to organise staff training. After the scandal, the schools regulator Ofsted was tasked with assessing how well schools taught the broad and vague-sounding subject of “British values”. I remember hearing how the (mostly white) teachers worried about the implications of this – would it alienate pupils and make them feel attacked, as though their Britishness was invalid? Could it jeopardise important and otherwise productive relationships of trust? After the scandal, there was also a sweeping change in the controversial counter-terrorism strategy Prevent, bringing in a statutory duty for teachers and other public service workers to spot and report signs of nonviolent extremism. This is alleged to have led to the racial profiling of Muslims, including children. For example, there is the allegation, mentioned in the podcast, that a nursery threatened to report a child for drawing a picture of his father with a “cooker bomb”. (It turned out to be the four-year-old’s mispronunciation of “cucumber”.) Syed’s passionate response to the way the scandal affected British Muslims is a central and compelling part of the podcast. At one point, he writes a letter to a potential interviewee saying he has never believed the received narrative around the case – or many of the people involved in the investigations around it. This is the moment Reed gets angry at Syed – but it is also a turning point in the podcast’s buddy-movie narrative. The pair discuss the true meaning of journalistic objectivity and Syed learns his lesson, emerging as a better journalist. But critics have been less understanding. In the week after our interview, the podcast is the subject of numerous articles, some accusing Syed of one-sidedness and even of demonstrating the very bias against which he is fighting. When I follow up with Reed and Syed on the phone about such controversies, they sound different: tired and annoyed. “If I was a healthcare reporter, my medical background would be seen as an advantage,” says Syed. “But as a Muslim, to report on a situation involving Muslims, somehow I am disqualified? Or somehow I have to make excuses for my presence? It’s not some great reveal that I’m a Muslim; I say [that I am] throughout the podcast.” Reed, too, has come under fire for his interview approach. Reed can certainly be intense, and I have a brief glimpse of this during our first interview. After I mention a legal notice sent around by the Department for Education (DfE) in advance of the release of the podcast – a reminder that anonymity orders had been granted to some witnesses involved in the affair – Reed pulls out his phone and begins recording me, ready to document any evidence of manoeuvring by the government that I may reveal. This week, Humanists UK released a lengthy statement arguing that Syed and Reed had misrepresented the views of Richy Thompson, its director of public affairs and policy, editing the content to make him sound bad and exploiting his unpreparedness. It says he was not aware it would be such an in-depth interview. In return, the New York Times sends me a statement saying the complaints were reviewed by the paper’s standards department, which found they lacked merit, bar one correction that runs on their site and has resulted in a re-record of that section of the podcast. “We’re reporters,” Reed says, exasperated. “We were acting professionally and ethically. And we were not treating people with kid gloves.” What about the accusations that they minimised or omitted testimony about the culture of misogyny at the school, including a now-infamous WhatsApp chat group in which male Muslim teachers described gay people as “animals”? The pair confirmed that they did interview one of the teachers involved, Razwan Faraz, who has publicly apologised for his comments and outlined his journey to educate himself. Of course, even six hours of podcast cannot cover every part of the story; the Trojan Horse scandal involved 21 schools, and there were many allegations that weren’t in the letter but that did appear in the press at the time. For example, it was claimed a schoolgirl had had her phone hacked into by teachers and then been suspended after they found a photo of her posing with a boy. However, the school says she was not hacked; that the photo was shown voluntarily; that it was of a lewd nature; and that, because she was underage, the police were informed. Reed and Syed say they prioritised inconsistencies and unresolved matters relating specifically to the letter, even if it meant cutting fascinating interviews. Another aspect that the podcast couldn’t cover was a mention in the Trojan Horse letter of a school where the headteacher is being pushed out. This is written in the present tense – but Reed says that the headteacher had left the school 15 years earlier. “We interviewed a governor from the school at that time – a British Pakistani guy – and asked him about that part of the letter, asking: ‘Even though the letter says it’s happening now, was it actually happening then?’ The guy was so outraged he was being accused of being in this plot. He was like: ‘I don’t even believe in religion. I’m a secular guy. The headteacher misrepresented herself on her CV and that’s why she was sacked.’ And then he goes: ‘But the rest of the letter is true, I think.’” Reed laughs, incredulously. “I was sad we couldn’t use that.” When, in our second interview, I return to the subject of omitting testimony, in particular around Tahir Alam, I can hear their frustration. Alam was a school governor who was banned from working in education after the scandal. He returned to headlines recently, supporting Birmingham parents’ protests in favour of banning LGBTQ+ lessons in school. “In our reporting, we acknowledge his views very clearly. And we acknowledged that row,” says Reed. “But we acknowledged those protests and that debate, which happened during our reporting, were not part of the Trojan Horse affair. “We report on specific instances of homophobia in some detail. We lay all that out very clearly. And we report specifically about comments that were made in that WhatsApp group.” Syed jumps in: “But the point that we make – and if anyone has an opposing view I would be intrigued to read it – is that those are legitimate issues that need to be addressed, but what Britain decided to do with it is turn it into an extremism issue.” Reed says: “What this series is, is a story about misinformation, about a conspiracy theory.” While rumours fly about their “true” intention for the podcast, they are resolute. What they want is more news, more investigation, for the story to be picked up again and investigated again. “Anybody. Just one reporter, local, national, someone from the council. Someone should just go and ask some questions,” says Syed. He says that one of the reasons the podcast took so long to produce was because many people – particularly from the Muslim community in Birmingham – had lost faith in society, its institutions and the press. Indeed, trying to convince them that telling their story could make a difference was half the battle. “Honestly, I’m dispirited,” says Reed. “We should be talking about the letter, and about the way the council dealt with the letter, and what Michael Gove did with the letter. And the fact that the council took a letter that they knew was bogus and submitted it as evidence in a tribunal.” He is referring to episode seven’s findings that Birmingham city council lawyers submitted the Trojan Horse letter to a tribunal as evidence of a plot, even though council officers had determined internally that the letter was not credible. “They may not be my officials, but I don’t think they should be doing that!” But doesn’t the city of Birmingham want to move on? I can almost hear Syed shaking his head. “The first night I was reporting on this, I went to an event [for Muslims] discussing what happened. It was in the aftermath of the [collapse of] misconduct cases brought against some of the teachers. It did not sound to me like people had moved on. Far from it! People were still extremely worried about what happened in 2014, and about what continued to be happening to the schools since. “This eagerness to put it behind, and put it in the past – I could understand that from authorities, I could understand that from Birmingham city council, or the DfE,” says Syed. “But I don’t understand that from journalists. You call it opening old wounds, I call it investigative journalism. And long may there be more of that, my friend.”",Arts/Television & radio,‘People have not moved on.
