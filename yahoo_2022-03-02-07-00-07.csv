The White House warned Saturday it could seize the yachts of sanctioned Russian oligarchs. The Maldives doesn't have an extradition treaty with the US. A super-yacht owned by a US-sanctioned Russian billionaire has arrived in the Maldives, AFP reported Tuesday. It's one of several Russian-owned pleasure craft believed to be headed to the sunny island nation, which doesn't have an extradition treaty with the US. The yacht, Clio, is owned by Oleg Deripaska, founder of Russian aluminum group Rusal, who was sanctioned by the US in 2018. Clio dropped anchor off Mala, capital of the Maldives, on Monday, AFP said, citing port officials. At least two other super-yachts owned by Russian billionaires set sail for the Maldives shortly after Western nations threatened to seize assets from sanctioned oligarchs, according to data from Marine Traffic, reported by CNBC. In a tweet Saturday, the White House said: ""This coming week, we will launch a multilateral Transatlantic task force to identify, hunt down, and freeze the assets of sanctioned Russian companies and oligarchs — their yachts, their mansions, and any other ill-gotten gains that we can find and freeze under the law."" Deripaska's 73-meter Clio ""was designed for long voyages around the world and self-sufficient living for several months at a time,"" according to its maker Lurssen. Deripaska was one of two Russian billionaires who spoke out on Sunday against Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying in a Telegram post that ""peace is very important."" The Biden administration recently targeted 10 Russian oligarchs as part of a sweeping package of sanctions against Russia. The sanctions aim to financially cripple the country's wealthiest members in retaliation for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Insider's Avery Hartman reported on Monday that Russian billionaires are still criss-crossing the globe on private jets and yachts despite the sanctions.

3/2/2022,"The Russian parallel of SWIFT will be the Financial Message Transfer System of the Bank of Russia (SPFS). This network will be open to mostly Belarusian banks. The SPFS network already has over 399 users, and Russia is in negotiations with China to join the SPFS. Russia decided to counter SWIFT with its SPFS following its SWIFT ban due to its invasion of Ukraine. The Financial Message Transfer System of the Bank of Russia (SPFS), which already has over 399 users, will now become the international payment settlement network. With every major power in the world condemning Vladimir Putin and his recent actions against Ukraine, the strain is falling on the economy of Russia. The myriad of sanctions placed on them is already looking brutal. To add to that, the worldwide payment settlement service provider SWIFT also excluded Russian banks recently. Thus to ensure that the Russian financial infrastructure does not collapse, the country launched the SPFS. While initially developed as an internal financial structure, the SPFS will also be extended for international payments. The head of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, announced that SPFS is open to participants from abroad. She also stated that the cards of international payment systems would continue to work as usual. Although the SPFS has existed for over six years now, it was restricted to domestic bank users. However, in April, over 20 Belarusian banks, the Armenian Arshidbank, and the Kyrgyz Bank of Asia joined it. Currently, the network has 399 users. The SPFS also boasts of conducting over 2 million messages monthly in 2020, which would place it 20.6% ahead of SWIFT. The only problem is that not many countries’ banks would want to join SPFS for multiple reasons. Firstly, the possibility of getting kicked off SWIFT would handicap their reach. Secondly, SPFS doesn’t have a lot of mainstream international banks. Even its supporter China is yet to join SPFS. Thus this limitation would also limit their capabilities. Besides, if the SPFS system fails, the Russian economy would collapse. As it is, the USD/RUB pair skyrocketed to 104.60 Rubles after yesterday. And with more sanctions, bans to foreign reserves access, blocking crypto access to Russians, the situation will only worsen. Many major crypto exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, and KuCoin previously outright rejected the appeal of banning accounts. The White House and The United States Treasury Department are now officially asking these exchanges to block crypto access. The ongoing peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine are yet to conclude. And if that fails to happen, the Russian people will be the ones to suffer.

3/2/2022,"By Joel Schectman, Christopher Bing and James Pearson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Ukrainian cyber guerrilla warfare group plans to launch digital sabotage attacks against critical Russian infrastructure such as railways and the electricity grid, to strike back at Moscow over its invasion, a hacker team coordinator told Reuters. Officials from Ukraine's defense ministry last week approached Ukrainian businessman and local cybersecurity expert Yegor Aushev to help organize a unit of hackers to defend against Russia, Reuters previously reported. On Monday, Aushev said he planned to organize hacking attacks that would disrupt any infrastructure that helps bring Russian troops and weapons to his country. ""Everything that might stop war,"" he told Reuters. ""The goal is to make it impossible to bring these weapons to our country."" Aushev said his group has already downed or defaced dozens of Russian government and banking websites, sometimes replacing content with violent images from the war. He declined to provide specific examples, saying it would make tracking his group easier for the Russians. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbor's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. A Ukrainian defense attache in Washington declined to comment on Aushev's group or its relationship with the defense ministry. Aushev said his group has so far grown to more than 1,000 Ukrainian and foreign volunteers. The group has already coordinated with a foreign hacktivist organization that carried out an attack on a railway system. After word spread of the formation of Aushev's team, the Belarusian Cyber Partisans, a Belarus-focused hacking team, volunteered to attack Belarusian Railways because they said it was used to transport Russian soldiers. The Cyber Partisans disabled the railway's traffic systems and brought down its ticketing website, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday. On Monday, a Cyber Partisans spokeswoman told Reuters the group carried out those attacks and confirmed her organization was now working with Aushev's group. The spokeswoman said because her group had brought down the reservation system, passengers could only travel by purchasing paper tickets in person. She sent Reuters a photo of a paper, handwritten ticket issued on Monday. ""We fully side with Ukrainians,"" she said. ""They are now fighting for not only their own freedom but ours too. Without an independent Ukraine, Belarus doesn’t stand a chance."" Reuters could not confirm attacks against the Belarus railway's traffic system. The company's reservation website was down on Tuesday afternoon. A railway spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Officials at the Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told a Russian news outlet on Tuesday that Russian embassies were under cyberattack by ""cyber terrorists from Ukraine."" Beyond striking back at Moscow, Aushev said his team would help Ukraine's military hunt down undercover Russian units invading cities and towns. He said his group had discovered a way to use cellphone tracking technology to identify and locate undercover Russian military units moving through the country, but declined to provide details. Russian troops are reportedly using commercial cell phones in Ukraine to communicate, multiple media outlets reported. Over the last week, numerous Russian government websites have been publicly interrupted by reported distributed denial of service (DDoS) style attacks, including one for the office of President Vladimir Putin.
