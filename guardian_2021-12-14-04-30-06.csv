12/14/2021,"The removal of a Canadian teacher for wearing a hijab in the classroom has sparked widespread condemnation of a controversial law in the province of Quebec, which critics say unfairly targets ethnic minorities under the pretext of secularism. Fatemeh Anvari, a third-grade teacher in the town of Chelsea, was told earlier this month that she would no longer be allowed to continue in the role because her headwear ran afoul of Bill 21, a law passed in 2019.  Under the measure, public servants in “positions of authority” – including police officers, lawyers, judges, bus drivers, doctors, social workers and teachers – are barred from wearing religious symbols such as turbans, kippahs and hijabs. But the law has an outsized impact on Muslim women and in schools in the province, where 74.5% of teachers are women. “This is not about my article of clothing. This is a bigger issue … I don’t want this to be a personal thing because that won’t do any good to anyone,” Anvari told CTV News. “I want this to be something in which we all think about how big decisions affect other lives.” Anvari’s dismissal has prompted protests at her school, where students and staff put up green ribbons and posters in support of her. The decision to remove Anvari from the classroom, and to reassign her to a literacy project on diversity and inclusion, has also led to frustration from federal politicians. On Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said no one should lose their job because of their religion – but refused to intervene, saying he didn’t want to create a fight between Quebec and the federal government. Trudeau said it was important “to ensure that it is Quebecers themselves who deeply disagree with the fact that someone can lose their job because of their religion”. New Democratic party leader Jagmeet Singh said Anvari’s abilities as a teacher were never in doubt, but “because of the way she looked and they way she dressed, she’s no longer able to teach these kids. That is everything that is wrong with this bill.” Conservative MP Kyle Seeback described Anvari’s dismissal as “an absolute disgrace”. While Conservative leader Erin O’Toole said he disagrees with the law, he told reporters he respects provincial jurisdiction and believes Bill 21 is “an issue that is best left for Quebecers to decide”. Federal leaders have been wary of angering voters in Quebec by taking too strong a stand against the law. In Quebec, where the measure has popular support, political leaders defended Bill 21. “The reason this teacher doesn’t have a job is because she didn’t respect the law,” said Pascal Bérubé, the Parti Québécois’s critic on secularism. “The law is for everyone. She tried to make a statement wearing a hijab.” Premier Francois Legault called Bill 21 “a reasonable law” adding that Anvari should not have been hired in the first place. Workers hired before March 2019 are still permitted to wear religious symbols at work. But because Anvari became a substitute teaching last spring and signed a new contract in October, she is barred from wearing a hijab in the classroom. Trudeau has said federal intervention would be unlikely to have much effect, given Quebec’s ability to invoke a constitutional override power known as the “notwithstanding clause” which protects the province from claims that its violates rights protected by Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms. English-language schools in the province have fought the law and recently lost a court challenge preventing the bill from going into effect.",News/World news,Outrage as Quebec teacher removed from classroom for wearing hijab under controversial law,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/canada-quebec-teacher-removed-classroom-hijab
12/14/2021,"Mainland China has reported its first case of the highly transmissible Omicron variant in the northern city of Tianjin, posing what could be the biggest threat to date to the country’s zero-Covid strategy. The Chinese authorities reported on Monday that the Omicron case was detected on 9 December from an overseas returnee, who showed no symptoms on arrival. The patient is being quarantined and treated in a designated hospital.  At the same time, the eastern province of Zhejiang has been battling a rise in new infections of the Delta variant in recent weeks. Cases of Omicron – first detected in South Africa and labelled a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organization – have now been reported in more than 50 countries. At least one person in the UK has died with Omicron, Boris Johnson said on Monday. Experts say that if not properly controlled, the variant could upend Beijing’s strategy to fully contain the pandemic. Since last year, the method has guaranteed Chinese citizens a largely virus-free life, but it has also been met with criticism by some medical professionals, who argued for an alternative plan to coexist with the virus with a sufficient vaccination rate. The first Omicron case in Tianjin comes as nearby Beijing gears up for the Winter Olympics, which are to be held in February. The Guardian understands the patient has no association with the Games. The arrival of the Omicron variant also coincided with Zhejiang – a province of 65 million people – battling against its first domestic cluster outbreak this year. Among the 80 new locally transmitted cases with symptoms in mainland China on 12 December, 74 were identified in Zhejiang. In October, the province reported just one local case. The outbreak in Zhejiang, a manufacturing hub and home to the e-commerce company Alibaba, led more than a dozen publicly listed companies to halt production on Monday. Their shares fell sharply as a result. The companies said they would comply with the virus control measures imposed by the local government, which will decide when production can resume. Among the worst affected cities in Zhejiang province is Shaoxing. Since 5 December, 123 of the 192 cases detected in the province were from the city of 5 million. A mass testing programme is under way. Early this month, the Chinese region of Hong Kong – which runs a separate health system from the mainland – reported its first cases of Omicron. On Monday, the territory reported two additional cases of the variant, bringing the total to seven. Hong Kong’s health authorities said that both cases were imported from the UK, where the health secretary, Sajid Javid, told MPs on Monday that Omicron now represents 20% of Covid cases in England.",News/World news,Mainland China reports first case of Omicron coronavirus variant,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/mainland-china-reports-first-case-of-omicron-coronavirus-variant
12/14/2021,"Although Britain’s Covid-19 death numbers are nowhere near their peak, it is sobering to note that the first person has died with the new Omicron variant. Daily infections have reached the highest level since January. Omicron is spreading like wildfire. It also seems to have unusual capacity for reinfection – leading some to conclude, in haste, that its symptoms are milder. Vaccines seem less effective against this new variant. There will almost certainly be needless deaths, possibly tens of thousands of lives lost in months, if nothing is done. That is why the government needs to face the facts and take serious action. It has so far failed to do so. History is not made in a vacuum. The country has the worst possible prime minister, leading the worst possible party of the worst possible persuasion at the worst possible time. Boris Johnson’s lack of moral probity, grasp of detail and competence has caught up with him in the polls – draining the authority he needs in a pandemic. Opportunists, minimal statists and troublemakers in the Conservative party sense an opening to bring Mr Johnson to heel and regard the inadequate restrictions announced as going too far to vote for. In favour of greater caution are the government’s own scientists, the Labour party and the public, but it’s Tory MPs who increasingly call the shots.  Mr Johnson hankers for a “magic bullet”. The government does not recognise that the social factors determining health are politically determined, and political action may be needed to improve them. The prime minister won’t acknowledge the roles poverty and inequality play in the risk of infection, the course of the disease and in fatality rates. Instead he places his faith in vaccines and home testing so Britons can “live with the virus”. Even here the government has been too slow to act. Children have already faced disruption to their schooling, yet the UK government has been tardy in vaccinating teenagers and has yet to approve a roll out for younger pupils. Boosters will help, but they won’t banish the threat of the Omicron pathogen. What is needed are interventions to stop the viral spread. If Covid again runs riot then there will be no alternative to reimposing a stringent lockdown with physical distancing rules and revived employment support schemes. The protection of hospitality workers with some form of vaccine identification raises the hackles of Tory MPs who have no problem that visitors to places where yellow fever is endemic have to prove vaccination with a “yellow card”. Ministers have yet to approve the mandatory wearing of effective masks, proper ventilation of classrooms and offices and sufficient sick pay. The shambles is such that when news leaked that the privatised and ineffective test and trace system was being wound down, local public health directors warned that they risked being handed more responsibility for Covid without new funding. Omicron has exposed the Little Britain mentality at the heart of government. The low vaccination rates in poorer nations have been cited as a key reason for the emergence of more dangerous coronavirus variants. Only 6% of people in low-income countries have received at least one dose. But the UK has refused to back a vaccine patent waiver and has cut foreign aid. So developing nations can’t manufacture their own cheap medicines and won’t have the resources to distribute them. The pandemic has been a poor advert for unrestrained market forces. Rudolf Virchow, the 19th-century German physician who first made the link between the typhus epidemic and poverty, once said that “medicine is social science and politics nothing but medicine on a grand scale”. That view has stood the test of time, as Britain – under Mr Johnson – is finding to its cost.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Boris Johnson: pandemic authority draining away | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/13/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnson-pandemic-authority-draining-away
12/14/2021,"Premiership clubs are facing tighter Covid-19 restrictions in light of the spread of the Omicron variant with new measures expected to be finalised this week. As of September, clubs have been permitted to relax restrictions and effectively abandon social-distancing measures during training and on matchdays provided they meet the 85% threshold of players and staff having received two vaccinations.  It is understood, however, that the Professional Game Board is expected to implement updated measures after the health secretary, Sajid Javid, revealed on Monday that the Omicron variant already makes up 20% of all Covid-19 cases in England. That in turn raises the possibility of Eddie Jones’s England squad facing tighter measures when they convene next month for the 2022 Six Nations. Bubble fatigue was cited by numerous players as a key reason for England’s dismal fifth-place finish. It was also referenced in the Rugby Football Union’s subsequent review. “The necessary stringent protocols, in some cases greater than other unions, had a significant impact on coaching and support staff as well as the playing squad cohesion,” read the union’s statement last April. In the shorter term the hope will be to avoid a repeat of last season, when 10 Premiership matches were cancelled because of Covid outbreaks and a two-week “circuit-breaker” was introduced in January after two rounds of European fixtures were wiped out. The second round of the Champions Cup is this weekend but a number of clubs are already dealing with outbreaks. Wasps lost their opening match against Munster – who were also badly affected by the pandemic – having been forced to make wholesale changes to their side following a number of positive tests last week. After the match the Wasps director of rugby, Lee Blackett, who is also without a raft of players because of injury, conceded he did not know whether the fixture against Toulouse on Sunday would go ahead with the results of this week’s Covid tests set to prove decisive. In addition, Leinster opted on Monday to postpone training after they were hit with an outbreak on Friday, 24 hours before their comfortable win against Bath. To compound matters for the tournament organisers, who have already seen the Scarlets forfeit their trip to Bristol last Saturday, Montpellier – Leinster’s opponents on Friday – have also registered a handful of positive cases. Clermont, La Rochelle, Northampton and Cardiff have all also been affected.",Sport/Sport,Premiership Rugby clubs face tighter Covid restrictions amid Omicron surge,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/13/premiership-clubs-face-tighter-covid-19-restrictions-omicron
12/14/2021,"An independent review has uncovered evidence of structural racism at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and found the institution’s colonial legacy continues to have a negative impact on students and staff of colour. Though the LSHTM has a higher proportion of staff of colour than the UK sector average, they are under-represented at senior levels, have less success at promotions, and are more likely to be on short-term and fixed-term contracts than their white peers, the review found.  Over the past two years the LSHTM has enjoyed a high-profile role in the global battle against the Covid pandemic. Among its many notable alumni is Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England. The damning review, published on Monday, found however that the culture and practices at the university “still too often disadvantage people of colour”, that the curriculum is Eurocentric, and that the leadership has been too slow to act on issues of colonialism and racism. It found staff and students of colour feel “unsupported” when experiencing or trying to address racist behaviours and “do not have equitable experiences or opportunities to progress at LSHTM”. It also said “behaviours” by senior staff had gone unaddressed because of their “influence” in the institution. The university council commissioned the review last year to look into racism and inequality at the university in response to the Black Lives Matter movement and concerns raised by the institution’s own students and staff. The report highlighted the LSHTM’s well-documented colonial history. It was founded by the UK government’s colonial office and its current success as a leader in global health and research, the report said, can be attributed in part to its role in British colonialism. “Many staff have dedicated their lives to advancing public health globally and LSHTM’s world-leading research has benefited a great many people worldwide, but the colonial attitudes inherent in LSHTM’s historical mission negatively impact students and staff of colour today,” the report said. The university has made a series of recommendations aimed at strengthening leadership, changing culture and behaviours, improving outcomes and experiences for staff and students of colour and improving the complaints and reporting processes. Liam Smeeth, who took over as LSHTM director in August, said: “This independent review found evidence of racism and inequalities which point to deeper, more structural problems within LSHTM that have negatively impacted the experiences of those within our organisation. “We understand that these experiences have had very real and painful human consequences. We deeply regret this and apologise sincerely to everyone affected. While the conclusions of the review are difficult to confront, facing up to them is an essential step towards creating an environment where everyone’s contributions and perspectives are valued. We are determined to do better. “We are committed to LSHTM being a place of anti-racist education, employment, research and partnerships. Racism has no place in our school or society, and will not be tolerated at LSHTM.” Dr Mishal Khan, associate professor of health policy and systems research and a member of the governing body that commissioned the review, added: “The report makes for painful reading, but I see it as a positive that LSHTM’s governing council had the foresight to commission such an independent review and unanimously accept the findings. There is a lot of work to do.”",News/Education,"Structural racism at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, finds report",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/13/structural-racism-at-london-school-of-hygiene-tropical-medicine-finds-report
12/14/2021,"At about 1pm in Paternoster Square on Monday, four placid, Christmassy eyes gazed at the trickle of workers emerging from the London Stock Exchange in search of lunch. “PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH THE REINDEER,” a sign on the enclosure said. “THIS IS TO PREVENT THE TRANSMISSION OF CORONAVIRUS.” “I remember when you could stroke them,” said a passing trader. “It’s so depressing. I wish I’d stayed at home now.”  Although a small crowd had gathered around the main attraction of the square’s Christmas market, the vast majority of workers in the area were at home on Monday, in line with the new official advice: “Work from home if you can.” That phrasing sounds softer than last year’s instruction that “everyone must work from home unless they are unable to do so” – leading some banks and brokerages to take a less stringent line than they have in the past. Many say workers can come in if they wish to. PwC, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, and KPMG were among those reported last week to be keeping their offices open. Even so, the City still felt roughly as sleepy as those reindeer. That would appear to be in line with data from Transport for London, which said passenger journeys during the morning peak were down by just under 20% on the previous week – and still drastically down on pre-pandemic levels, at about 46% of the old normal. Harry, who is on a placement at Bank of America, said that his nearby office was much quieter than usual – four people on his floor as opposed to “a couple of dozen” last Monday – and staff had been told they were to decide whether they would prefer to work from home or the office. “My manager and I decided we still wanted to be coming in,” said Harry – who, like many of the junior City workers approached by the Guardian, asked to use a pseudonym. “At the start of my placement I was working from home full-time and, while it was nice, I definitely didn’t get to make the kind of connections you need.” Cautious about the risk of bringing the virus with him if he were to leave London at Christmas, he is sacrificing his usual trip home this year. “You just want to be careful,” he said. Paul Chapman, a managing director at Tysers insurance brokers, said his company was “desperate to do the right thing”. He added: “We’re very keen not to ruin anybody’s Christmas.” He said that approach was typical across the City. At the same time, Chapman said, he saw inconsistencies in the government’s advice. “I went to the theatre, and it was absolutely rammed. I was in the Ned [a hotel and members’ club] last night and it was absolutely rammed. And yet the train is empty, and the City was empty this morning.” In Canary Wharf, most lunch stalls said they had seen a significant drop-off, with several saying they were at about 20% of their usual trade. “Normally by 1pm we’d have about £500,” said Catarina Ferreira, working at Rudie’s Jerk Shack. “Today it’s £98. It’s easily the worst day for three months.” David, vaping outside Citibank in the rain, said his office was “a good bit quieter”. He said the company’s advice had been “basically, keep going as you are – if you want to work from home you can do that, if you need to work from the office or you want to because it helps with your mental health, you can do that”. Citibank confirmed that was its approach, noting that it required staff to take a lateral flow test three times a week. Asked whether he felt the advice from the government had been sufficiently clear, David said firmly: “I don’t think I need clarity from the government about what I should be doing. I think I’m an adult.” That robust view – perhaps representative of a wider and unsurprising distaste for state intervention among the City’s enthusiastic capitalists – was echoed by Nila, on her way back to HSBC. “I’m so tired of politicians telling us what we should be doing,” she said. Others took a more critical view of the government’s approach, arguing that official advice without help for small businesses that were affected by the loss of commuter footfall was unfair. “I find it sad,” said Nicola Bowyer, who works at a printing company near the Bank of England. “I just feel for the sandwich bars and restaurants. They get no support. It’s crap, isn’t it?” Her enthusiasm for any further imposition of new rules would be significantly dampened by the messengers, she added. “I’m so over it,” she said. “I just think, I’m sorry, but why should we listen to what these idiots tell us? I shall be doing what I want to. Within reason.”",News/World news,‘So depressing’: Covid empties City of London of pre-Christmas cheer,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/so-depressing-covid-empties-city-of-london-of-pre-christmas-cheer
12/14/2021,"The first episode of Squid Game, the South Korean dystopian drama that became not only the year’s biggest TV show but Netflix’s most popular series of all time, has plenty of hooks: an underdog protagonist, an intriguing high-stakes mystery, the thrill of watching a widely recognizable childhood game rendered a matter of life and death. But the real kick of the series arrives in the second episode: the players, each facing financial ruin for various reasons, vote to quit the eponymous game and return to their lives, only to find the allure of a gamble preferable to the crushing weight of debt. By the end of the second episode, everyone has chosen to return to Squid Game, with a money pot of 45.6 billion won ($40m) literally hung from the ceiling.  It’s an incredibly bleak message – that people find the odds of surviving a sadistic game more favorable than achieving financial stability outside it – that struck a chord with millions living through our bleak, highly inequitable times. Squid Game’s unsparing brutality was a good match for a year in which the 745 wealthiest Americans alone made enough money to fund more than half of Biden’s beleaguered social spending plan, in which billionaires took their dick-swinging contest to space, and in which Fox News spun an attempted coup into Republican orthodoxy (and profit). Though the bloodiest, Squid Game is not the only popular show this year to present a dire reflection of our economic system: The White Lotus, HBO’s breakout summer hit about a week at a decadent and morally decaying resort in Hawaii, sent up wealth privilege and its attendant self-delusion with sharp teeth and lush visuals; the third season of HBO’s Succession, arguably the buzziest drama on TV right now, found its media mogul family (loosely based on the Murdochs, owner of Fox News) once again being miserable, ruining each other with malice and American democracy without a thought, and always evading accountability. Strip all three of these shows of their incisive barbs or sexual tension or meticulous set-dressing, and you’ll find the same molten black core: an economic system so stratified and broken as to be inescapable, invincible (in the timeline of these stories), and toxic from top to bottom. In each, emotional misery is a given, and ultimately preferable to ceding any privilege. The American dream and much of American media has long idealized the pursuit of money and the whims of the rich, but there is absolutely nothing enviable or aspirational about the wealthy in these shows. Dark parables or portraits of capitalism are, of course, not unique to 2021 – in western media, see: The Hunger Games series, the popularity of Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite, or the loony satire of Sorry to Bother You. Nor is the idea that money cannot buy happiness new to television – HBO has practically created a sub-genre for rich white people being miserable and/or terrible, from Big Little Lies to The Undoing. But what’s striking about this year’s crop of shows is just how little redemption they offer, just how few comforts they find in the capitalist status quo. The contestants in Squid Game scrap and form loyalties and betray each other – the foibles of human morality under pressure – for (minor spoiler) the sport of ultra-wealthy Americans, no one character able to stop the crushing wheel of the game. The White Lotus loops through a merry-go-round of emotional exploitation that doesn’t spare even the most sympathetic characters, and ends more or less where it started: a new round of expectant guests arrives as the former depart, combustions and revelations having made little difference. It’s easier to fixate on the perceived slight of a barely smaller hotel suite, or cover infidelity with $70,000 bracelets, or to stay in a clearly terrible new marriage, than to change. Succession’s somewhat frustrating third season has wheel-spun through the same dynamics of emotional abuse it has honed since its first season, but wealth remains the trump card. Nothing sticks to Waystar Royco – not a scandal over coverups of sexual assault in its cruise division, not the threat of a hostile takeover by their main rival, not a federal investigation over corporate malfeasance, not even political headwinds. The justice department comes for Waystar, and even that’s not enough – patriarch Logan Roy directs his channel, a stand-in for Fox News, to pressure the Republican president, a former ally referred to derisively as “The Raisin,” forcing him to abandon plans for a second term. The characters on Succession are each sad and pathetic in their own way, but the world is set up so the Roys, and especially Logan, never take a true loss. These shows aren’t so much anti-capitalist (they’re on Netflix and HBO after all, and none imagine a different way, though that’s admittedly a lot to ask of entertainment) as fiercely down on the present, which appears not to be working for anyone – not the resort staff and vacationers bound in an awkward compact, not the billionaire media heirs whose wealth isolates them from human emotion, and certainly not the ordinary debtors who would prefer to try their odds in a perverse tournament than face the struggle of scraping by in the real world. To be clear, I loved each of these shows for their own reasons, laughed more at their sharp writing than at many comedies. But sometimes I wonder if we’ve reached the bottom of the barrel with television bleakness. It can be gloriously refreshing to watch television that dares to acknowledge things are very, very bad, and in 2021, some of the best shows dressed this black pit of late-stage capitalism with deliciously deranged dialogue, edge of your seat suspense, gorgeous Hawaiian vistas, Halloween costume– worthy outfits, a Jennifer Coolidge performance for the ages. But they’re still staring the pit down, sparing no one the poison. Hope, collectivism, the imagination of a different way? Maybe that’s for 2022.",Arts/Television & radio,Money problems: how wealth on television became miserable this year,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/13/money-problems-wealth-television-miserable-this-year
12/14/2021,"An Instagram user with the handle @metaverse last month found herself blocked from her account, which featured a decade of her life and work – after parent company Facebook changed its corporate name to Meta. On 28 October, Facebook, which owns Instagram, kept the social media platform Facebook so named but changed its umbrella corporate name to Meta – signaling an effort to reflect the virtual world that the tech giant considers the future of the internet.  On 2 November, Thea-Mai Baumann, an Australian artist and technologist, suddenly found her account disabled, the New York Times first reported. A message flashed on her screen: “Your account has been blocked for pretending to be someone else.” Baumann said she tried to verify her identity with Instagram over the next few weeks but received no response. “This account is a decade of my life and work. I didn’t want my contribution to the metaverse to be wiped from the internet,” Baumann told the outlet. “That happens to women in tech, to women of color in tech, all the time,” the artist, who is of Vietnamese descent, added. Baumann started her Instagram account in 2012 to document her life as an arts student in Brisbane and the augmented reality company that she went on to create, called Metaverse Makeovers. According to its website, describing wearable “appcessories”, the company’s Metaverse Nails offering “is the only product in the world that allows you to adorn your digital and physical self with customisable holograms. It’s glam wearable tech.” A month after Baumann first appealed to Instagram to get her account restored, the New York Times contacted Meta on 2 December to ask why Baumann’s account had been shut down. According to an Instagram spokesperson, the account had been “incorrectly removed for impersonation” and would be restored, which it was, two days later. “We’re sorry this error occurred,” the company added. Despite getting her account back, Baumann remains worried about the future of the metaverse, a still-mostly-hypothetical virtual world accessed by special virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technology. “Because I have been working in the metaverse space for so long, 10 years, I just feel worried.” She is afraid that its culture could be “corrupted by the kind of Silicon Valley tech bros who I feel lack vision and integrity”, she said.",News/Technology,Instagram disabled artist’s @metaverse handle after Facebook rebranded to Meta,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/13/metaverse-facebook-instagram-handle-disabled-artist
