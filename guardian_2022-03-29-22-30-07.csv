3/29/2022,"An Irish journalist killed alongside a Ukrainian colleague when their Fox News team came under fire near Kyiv paid “a terrible price” for his love of “truth telling”, the congregation at his funeral mass has heard. Pierre Zakrzewski, 55, a cameraman and Oleksandra “Sasha” Kuvshynova, 24, died in gunfire earlier this month in Horenka, on the north-west outskirts of the Ukrainian capital, along with the British correspondent Benjamin Hall, who was injured in the attack. Ireland’s foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, and aides-de-camp representing the president, Michael Higgins, and the taoiseach, Micheál Martin, attended the mass as did diplomats representing the US, Ukrainian, Polish and French embassies. “Truth-telling is a work of love, and love always comes at a price, and what a terrible price,” Father Kieran Dunne told the congregation in Dublin on Tuesday. Zakrzewski is one of 12 journalists killed since the Russian invasion began, with 10 others injured, according to Iryna Venediktova, Ukraine’s prosecutor general. “Revealing the truth about Putin’s aggression is getting increasingly risky and dangerous,” she said. Several speakers paid tribute to Zakrzewski’s colleague Kuvshynova. Zakrzewski’s cousin Krzys said: “Lord, we pray that you protect media personnel and journalists who stand up for the truth by speaking the truth. Enable them to be the voice of the voiceless and give a face to the faceless,” said Zakrzewski’s cousin, Krzys. Tim Santhouse, a Fox News producer, said Zakrzewski was “one of the main reasons” he had joined the broadcaster, impressed by his steely determination to get through customs with his large pack of camera equipment and give voice to the voiceless, bringing news from Afghanistan and other war zones to a worldwide audience. “He appreciated the life others lead and considered things from their point of view, especially those who were in his viewfinder,” he said. As a war photographer, Zakrzewski covered conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria for Fox, according to a memo sent to employees by Suzanne Scott, the chief executive of Fox News Media, after his death. His brother Stas told how “Pierre had refused to be constrained by a traditional education and instead chose to teach himself about the world and politics through travel” to Europe in his teens, and then beyond, to Afghanistan, Pakistan and India where his photography interests dovetailed into journalism. He was “highly inspirational to his friends and family” and taught people “to think outside the boundaries”, his brother said.",News/World news,Tributes paid at funeral to ‘inspirational’ Irish journalist killed in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/tributes-funeral-irish-journalist-pierre-zakrzewski-ukraine
3/29/2022,"The Democratic speaker of the US House, Nancy Pelosi, said she “fears for democracy” if Republicans retake the chamber in November. “It is absolutely essential for our democracy that we win,” Pelosi said in an interview during the 2022 Toner Prizes for political journalism on Monday night. “I fear for our democracy if the Republicans were ever to get the gavel. We can’t let that happen. Democracy is on the ballot in November.” Parties that control the White House usually receive a rebuke from voters in the first midterms after a presidential election. With Joe Biden’s poll numbers in the gutter and his administration facing strong economic headwinds and grappling with the crisis in Ukraine, Republicans are widely favored to win back the House and perhaps the Senate this year. Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, told Punchbowl News last week: “We’re going to win the majority, and it’s not going to be a five-seat majority.” In the Senate, Ron Johnson, from Wisconsin, has indicated how Republicans are looking forward to controlling committees and wielding subpoena power. The GOP, Johnson said, will be “like a mosquito in a nudist colony, it’s a target-rich environment”. Johnson indicated a desire to investigate the federal coronavirus response and the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the president’s son. Most observers expect House Republicans to scrap the committee investigating Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn his election defeat and the Capitol attack that followed. But Pelosi said: “I don’t have any intention of the Democrats losing the Congress in November.” Rejecting “so-called conventional wisdom” about midterm elections, the speaker said: “There’s nothing conventional anymore, because of the way people communicate with social media and how they receive their information, how they are called to action, how they’re called to meetings and the rest is quite different. So any past assumptions about elections are obsolete.” “We do have a plan,” she added. “We have a vision of the victory. We will plan to get it done and we’re going to own the ground.” Pelosi also cast doubt on the accuracy of polling about Biden’s favourability and said redistricting, a process widely thought to favour Republicans, who control more state governments, would not necessarily leave Democrats at a disadvantage. “Everybody said redistricting was going to be horrible for the Democrats,” Pelosi said. “Remember that? Not so. Not so. If anything, we’ll pick up seats rather than lose 10 to 15, which conventional wisdom said that we would. There’s nothing conventional anymore, and it certainly ain’t wisdom. “And nobody’s going to be rejecting the president.”",News/US news,Pelosi says she ‘fears for democracy’ if Republicans retake Congress,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/29/nancy-pelosi-democracy-republicans-congress
3/29/2022,"It was the slap that launched a thousand hot takes. Here’s what Will Smith hitting Chris Rock at the Oscars tells us about the actor’s early childhood. Here’s what Smith’s violent outburst can teach us about the war in Ukraine. Here’s why the whole thing felt staged. Here’s the history of public slapping in 10 gifs. Here’s why the Academy is hypocritical for saying it doesn’t condone violence, when Michael Moore got booed during the 2003 Oscars for criticising the Iraq war – and you don’t get any more violent than war, do you? Look, you’ve probably had enough of people talking smackgate by now. I’m sure you’re over this whole thing. I get it. The sensible little voice in my head is telling me: “Arwa, don’t get involved. You don’t need to wade into this sordid story and turn a celebrity fracas into a lesson about life, the universe, and everything.” Alas, like Will Smith, I’m afraid I just can’t control myself. Just as he couldn’t repress his urge to slap, I can’t repress my urge to pundit. So I’d like to take a minute; just sit right there, and I’ll tell you why Chris Rock should never have made that stupid joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith’s, hair. First things first, though: let me get the Violence Is Very Bad and Never the Answer disclaimer out of the way. I’m not trying to victim blame here; it doesn’t matter what Rock said, he obviously didn’t deserve to be assaulted. Smith was very much in the wrong. But we can recognise that, while also acknowledging how cruel Rock’s comments were. Pinkett Smith revealed a few years ago that she has alopecia; laughing about how she resembles GI Jane was in extremely bad taste. I’m firmly of the opinion that you should be able to joke about anything – but if you’re going to wade into sensitive territory, then you’d better be clever about it. “Ha ha, she’s bald and looks like GI Jane, ha ha ha,” is the sort of comment a toddler makes. It’s not funny, it’s just mean. If you’ve never lost your hair, it might be hard to wrap your head around how traumatising the experience can be. It might be hard to understand how a throwaway gag like Rock’s can cut you to the core. I’ve never experienced alopecia but, when I was 14, my hair started falling out because of my anorexia; I’d pull big chunks of it out in the shower. Considering all the other ways starvation was hurting my body, losing a bit of ornamental dead matter from my scalp shouldn’t really have been so distressing. But hair isn’t just ornamental, is it? Like it or not, hair is tangled up in deeply rooted ideas about gender, identity and self-worth. Involuntarily losing your hair feels like losing part of yourself. And you don’t just feel lacking on the inside; the outside world treats you differently. Hair is a hell of a lot more than dead matter; it has a massive impact on your self-confidence. And Black women’s hair, of course, is even more loaded with cultural meaning. It’s not like Rock doesn’t know any of this: he’s the guy, after all, who made a documentary in 2009 called Good Hair, which examined Black women’s relationship with their hair, after his three-year-old daughter asked him why she didn’t have “good hair”. That was the most frustrating thing about his gag: he knows better; he knows a lot better. Anyway, now that I’ve got my take in, and Smith has issued an official apology, I think we can all consider the matter closed and move on. Here’s hoping next year’s Oscars will be violence-free.",Opinion/Opinion,Jada Pinkett Smith wasn’t the only one furious at Chris Rock’s Oscars gag. I know how traumatic hair loss is,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/29/jada-pinkett-smith-wasnt-the-only-one-furious-at-chris-rocks-oscars-gag-i-know-how-traumatic-hair-loss-is
