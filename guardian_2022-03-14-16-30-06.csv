3/14/2022,"When she was 17, Magi Sque – who then went by the name of Rosie – had the beginnings of a dream. On Saturdays she worked in the Calypso clothing boutique in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, and after each shift she handed her £5 wage to her mother. She was saving for her passage to England, where she hoped to become a nurse. But handling all those rich prints and sateen cottons “sparked an interest” for Sque, now 74. “My family would tell you I have always said: ‘When I can, I’m going to have my own clothing brand.’” But for five decades she instead practised, studied and taught nursing, eventually becoming an emeritus professor at Wolverhampton University, all the while nudging her sartorial dreams further into the future. But as she approached her 70th birthday, she began to think: “Oh no, not another thesis to read, not another essay to correct.” And then she heard herself say: “It’s time to move on.” She enrolled on a weekend course for startups and, in 2019, days before she turned 72, Sque launched Magi Rose – “distinctive, fun to wear, for downtime and holidays”. She flicks the pages of her sketchbook. And then she happens upon a photo of herself in Calypso all those years ago. Sque sailed to England at 18 for an interview at Guy’s hospital, London. She was one of three passengers – she didn’t know the other two – in “a banana boat … You could see the waves above you.” In her suitcase she had a red velour hoodie she had bought at Calypso and a gold watch shaped like a beetle – a gift from her father, “a very, very good man”, who gave neighbours financial help and donated to hospitals. “You squeezed the wings to open [the watch]. He said: ‘I’m giving you this beetle so you don’t bring one home.’” Sque qualified at Guy’s, and she did “bring home a Beatle” – a husband. “Long hair. From Liverpool. Looked like John Lennon.” After eight years, the marriage ended and Sque moved to Canada with her young daughter. In Toronto, many of the nurses had master’s certificates. Sque admired “their knowledge and decision-making skills”. She thought: “That’s what I want.’” Around this time, a friend gave her a copy of The Other Wise Man, the story of a fourth magus who was bringing a pouch of jewels to Bethlehem but didn’t get there because he kept stopping to help others, donating a jewel each time. Maybe because of her father’s philanthropy, the story struck a chord. “It was a period in my life when I wanted a change,” she says. As she considered academia, she thought: “The magi were wise men. That’s a nice association.” Although she had always been known as Rosie, her parents had named her Margaret Rose, after Princess Margaret, and now she switched to Magi. It was as Magi that she met her second husband, when he asked her for the time in the foyer of a cinema in Toronto. She clocked his English accent, they got talking and arranged to meet after their films. “I didn’t expect to see him again, but there he was, waiting for me.” When Michael’s holiday ended, he returned to England but stayed in touch; last January they celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary. Sque completed a degree in nursing at Surrey University, then cast around for a subject for a PhD. At a talk on organ donation, she had “a sort of epiphany”. Maybe the idea chimed with the story of the fourth magi (“Organ donors can save the lives of up to eight people,” she says). “It was like something came down and said: ‘This is what you’ve got to do.’” She became an expert, developing a theory of “dissonant loss” – the need for donor families to resolve the dissonance between a loved one being clinically brain dead and looking normal before they can agree to donation. Sque even addressed the House of Lords. So is her clothing line a calling, too? She looks around her home in New Milton, Hampshire. “There is nothing material I need … The intention with Magi Rose was to get a successful business so I can be philanthropic,” she says. Her dream is to donate to hospitals in Jamaica. “But first I have to get this business up and running.” Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",Lifestyle/Life and style,A new start after 60: ‘I always wanted my own clothing brand – at 71 I got it’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/14/a-new-start-after-60-i-always-wanted-my-own-clothing-brand-at-71-i-got-it
3/14/2022,"With the Galaxy S22 Ultra superphone, Samsung has brought back its popular Note line in all but name, equipping it with a built-in stylus and the competition-beating camera with both 3x and 10x optical zoom from last year’s S21 Ultra. Costing £1,149 ($1,200/A$1,849) it is one of the most expensive non-folding phones you can buy but it offers features you simply can’t get on other phones and will receive at least five years of software updates – longer than any other Android. The S22 Ultra looks nothing like the S22+ or other models in the “S-line”. Instead, the new superphone updates the design of the Note 20 Ultra from 2020 complete with an “S Pen” stylus that neatly slots into the bottom for storage and charging. The top and bottom are flat metal, while the glass back and front curve at the sides to meet an aluminium band. It is a really big and imposing phone but one that is relatively easy to hold and use. I can just about wield it one-handed without an an accessory but would likely resort to a Popsocket or similar on the back for the long term. The 6.8in screen is stunning: sharp, smooth with up to a 120Hz refresh rate, and with an extremely high peak brightness of 1,750nits (a standard measure of screen brightness), which makes it easier to read in direct sunlight than rivals. Main screen: 6.8in QHD+ Dynamic Amoled 2X (500ppi) 120Hz Processor: Samsung Exynos 2200 (EU) or Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 (US) RAM: 8 or 12GB of RAM Storage: 128, 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: One UI 4.1 based on Android 12 Camera: Quad rear camera: 108MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide, 10MP 3x and 10x telephoto; 40MP front-facing Connectivity: 5G, USB-C, wifi 6E, NFC, Bluetooth 5.2, UWB and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 mins) Dimensions: 163.3 x 77.9 x 8.9mm Weight: 228g In the US the S22 Ultra has the standard top Android chip for 2022 from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, while in the EU it has a Samsung Exynos 2200. General performance was excellent – it handled multiple apps on screen at any one time with no slowdown, although it was not perceptibly faster than the already snappy models of last year. Gaming performance of the Exynos 2200 was more variable than rivals fitted with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. The battery life is great. The S22 Ultra lasts in excess of 40 hours between charges, including three hours on 5G, with the screen set to FHD+ resolution and actively used for more than 6.5 hours with a variety of chap apps, the camera, Chrome, Spotify, 2.5 hours of Netflix and a light bit of gaming. Increasing the resolution of the display to its maximum QHD+ reduced the screen-on time by about an hour. The phone should easily make it through the heaviest of days, or two if used more frugally, which is longer than most rivals except the 48-hour-plus iPhone 13 Pro Max. Samsung does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery. Those in similar devices typically maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for at least 500 full charge cycles. The phone is generally repairable. Screen repairs cost £229, while the battery is replaceable by authorised service centres. But the phone only scores a three out of 10 on iFixit’s repairability ranking. Several internal components are made from 20% recycled nylon or plastic. Samsung offers trade-in and recycling schemes for old devices. The company publishes annual sustainability reports but not impact assessments for individual products. The S22 Ultra ships with OneUI 4.1, which is based on the latest version of Android 12 and receives prompt updates unlike some competitors. The Ultra has several customisations to the software to accommodate the S Pen stylus. These include handwriting recognition, various screen-writing and screenshot tools, translation and gesture support, including using the S Pen as a remote or magic wand to perform actions. For quickly jotting down notes, marking up documents or screenshots, or doodles, the S Pen is unrivalled. The S22 Ultra will receive at least five years of software updates from release, including four major Android version updates and monthly security patches, making it one of the longest-lasting Android devices available and just behind Apple’s six-year-plus support for its iPhones. The S22 Ultra has the same quad-camera set up as 2021’s S21 Ultra with not one but two optical zoom cameras producing equally impressive results. The main 108MP camera produces 12MP images by default and is one of the best available, shooting highly detailed, well-balanced images, with improved low light performance over last year’s model, although sometimes faces can be overly brightened at night. The 12MP ultra-wide is good, too, with better low light performance and generally improved image clarity. The 3x and 10x 12MP cameras are still the stars of the show. They are both better on detail, producing clearer and sharper images with less obvious image processing than last year. The 3x zoom is great for shooting people or nearby objects, while the 10x zoom provides meaningful magnification for closing the distance on things you can’t physically move toward. Planes in the sky, boats at sea or distant landmarks are now all within reach. You can continue with digital zoom on top of the 10x optical zoom. Shots up to 30x are very good with less grain and better colour than last year, while up to 100x zoom has improved detail and more accurate outlines of objects. It still looks like an oil painting but you’d be able to make out a car numberplate at maximum zoom during the day if you’re steady enough. The macro mode for closeup photography works well, while the selfie camera is one of the best in the business, producing excellent shots in a range of light levels. Some rival cameras are better at individual things but as a package there’s no other phone that can beat the adaptability and killer zoom of the S22 Ultra’s camera system. The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra costs from £1,149 ($1,199.99/A$1,849) with 128GB of storage. For comparison, the Galaxy S22 costs £769, the S22+ costs £949, the Z Flip 3 costs £949, the Z Fold 3 costs £1,599, the Google Pixel 6 Pro costs £849 and the iPhone 13 Pro Max costs £1,049 The S22 Ultra should really be called a Galaxy Note. It’s a giant phone for power users, offering unrivalled features, from the fantastic camera with more optical zoom than any other to the long battery life, stunning display and powerful built-in S Pen stylus. However, it is the stylus that may render the phone a bit of a niche product. Samsung’s most devoted fans were Note buyers who will be very happy, as the S22 Ultra provides a best-in-class writing and drawing experience. But many people will probably never remove the stylus from its dock. It is really good to see Samsung using recycled material in a phone for the first time, and providing at least five years of software updates from release, making it the longest-lasting Android available. It is not quite as exciting as some of the new breed of folding phones. But the S22 Ultra is the best Android superphone money can buy and will take some beating this year. Pros: huge 120Hz screen, fantastic and flexible camera with 3x and 10x optical zoom, One UI, S Pen stylus, good performance, long battery, five years of software support, contains recycled materials. Cons: huge, heavy, very expensive, S Pen may be superfluous feature for many, gaming performance variable for EU model.

3/14/2022,"At some point in the stretch of days between the start of the pandemic’s third year and the launch of world war three, a new phrase entered the zeitgeist, a mysterious harbinger of an age to come: people were going “goblin mode”. The term embraces the comforts of depravity: spending the day in bed watching 90 Day Fiancé on mute while scrolling endlessly through social media, pouring the end of a bag of chips in your mouth; downing Eggo toaster oven waffles with hot sauce over the sink because you can’t be bothered to put them on a plate. Leaving the house in your pajamas and socks only to get a single Diet Coke from the bodega. Inherent to the phrase is the idea that it can be switched on and off, said Dave McNamee, a self-described “real-life goblin” whose tweet about goblin mode recently went viral. Goblin mode is not a permanent identity, he said, but a frame of mind. “Goblin mode is like when you wake up at 2am and shuffle into the kitchen wearing nothing but a long t-shirt to make a weird snack, like melted cheese on saltines,” he said. “It’s about a complete lack of aesthetic. Because why would a goblin care what they look like? Why would a goblin care about presentation?” First appearing on Twitter as early as 2009, “goblin mode” has also been linked by some to a viral Reddit post from a user claiming to secretly walk around their house “like a goblin,” collecting trinkets and “making goblin noises”. But according to Google Trends it started to rise in popularity in early February and spiked after a doctored headline attributed a quote with the phrase to Kanye West muse and it-girl of the moment Julia Fox. “Just for the record. I have never used the term ‘goblin mode’,” Fox later clarified in an Instagram story. The Twitter user who made up the Fox quote as a joke said that while the headline was fake, she believes goblin mode is a very real phenomenon. “Goblin mode is kind of the opposite of trying to better yourself,” says Juniper, who declined to share her last name. “I think that’s the kind of energy that we’re giving going into 2022 – everyone’s just kind of wild and insane right now.” On TikTok, #GoblinMode is affixed to videos of everything from “smoking weed alone and getting scared”, to “not taking your meds”, and “hoarding weird shit just in case you run out”. In other videos, it is associated with women wearing no makeup and mismatched sweat suits, speaking confessional-style into the camera. The trend represents a direct departure from the hyper-curated “cottagecore” influence of early pandemic days, a standout trend of 2020 that included pastel colors, bucolic scenery, and the showcasing of wholesome homemaking skills such as baking and embroidery. Cottagecore thrived under the wistful ethos of making the best of what many people assumed would be only a few boring weeks at home in 2020. But as the pandemic wears on endlessly, and the chaos of current events worsens, people feel cheated by the system and have rejected such goals. Peter Hayes, a Bay Area tech worker who says he and his friends have jokingly called themselves goblins , said the term has taken off as the pandemic eliminated the need to keep up appearances. “At home there’s no social pressure to follow norms, so you sort of lose the habit,” he says. “There’s also a feeling that we’re all fucked, so why bother?” On TikTok, #goblinmode is often accompanied by the adjacent phrase #feralgirlsummer. That hashtag has 366,000 views and features videos of users proclaiming to be the opposite of “that girl” – a highly-curated aesthetic popular on TikTok in recent years. There are nearly 3bn views on videos using #thatgirl, many of them show influencers organizing pristine refrigerators full of freshly cut vegetables, making organic breakfasts, and doing elaborate skincare routines. “You have to start romanticizing your life,” they tell us as they make green tea lattes at home. The trend “sets an unrealistic standard for girls to think that if they aren’t waking up early to exercise, their lives are not put together”, one blog indictment of “that girl” culture reads. “I have absolutely no interest in being ‘that girl’,” one video with 160,000 views says. “I will never wake up at 5 am and drink green juices and be hyper-organized. I will instead be in 4am Reddit holes, Diet Coke first thing in the morning, [and] fistfuls of raw pasta as a snack.” Though they do not explicitly use the term “goblin mode”, videos expressing similar ideologies have been rising in popularity. “My body is a garbage can with an expiration date and I got no time for healthy shit,” one with 90,000 views says. “I love barely holding onto my sanity and making awful selfish choices and participating in unhealthy habits and coping mechanisms,” said another with 325,000 views. The goblin mode umbrella can encapsulate many kinds of aesthetics and behaviors, says Cat Marnell, an author who has been tweeting extensively in recent weeks about entering goblin mode herself. Although many people tweeting about goblin mode have characterized it as an almost spiritual-level embrace of our most debased tendencies, Marnell says there is “healthy goblin mode and destructive goblin mode”. For her, it embodies a certain air of harmless mischief. “The power of goblin mode is that it takes over your body,” she says. “It is a scrambling of the brain. It’s when you act crazy, and you enter a very mythological space – you want to jump on the back of a salamander and make trouble.” Call it a vibe shift or a logical progression into nihilism after years of pandemic induced disappointment, but goblin mode is here to stay. And why shouldn’t it? Who were we trying to impress, anyway? As one #goblinmode audio says: “If you can’t handle me in goblin mode, you don’t deserve me at my slay.” “It is cool to be a goblin,” Marnell says. “Everyone is so perfect all the time online, it is good to get in touch with the strange little creature that lives inside you.”",News/Technology,Slobbing out and giving up: why are so many people going ‘goblin mode’?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/14/slobbing-out-and-giving-up-why-are-so-many-people-going-goblin-mode
3/14/2022,"The worn wooden panels squeak under Rafael Molina’s heavy steps as he paces the saloon. Outside, the sound of a few loose galloping horses resonates from afar, breaking the silence of the surrounding desert. The town’s empty shops and abandoned storehouses look as if they have been ransacked by a band of cowboy bandits. “When I was a kid I could only dream about all this,” says the 68-year-old with undisguised pride. “At that time, my only aspiration was to see a film set first-hand. Today I am the owner of one of the most famous ones in the history of western movies.” Rafael Molina, 68, a former stuntman and actor, now the owner of Fort Bravo A former actor and stuntman, Molina bought Fort Bravo at the end of the 70s. Nowadays this western film set is one of the busiest in the world, one of three located around the small town of Tabernas and its homonymous desert, in the Spanish province of Almería. In past decades, these rugged mountains, arid plains and dry canyons have served as shooting ground for more than 170 westerns, including masterpieces such as the The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West. Molina started his cinema career in the mid-70s, when he showed up uninvited on the set of Take a Hard Ride, hoping for a job. The movie was being shot in the Canary Islands, but Molina’s fascination with westerns was such that he burned all his savings for a plane ticket to get there. “I did all sorts of jobs on the set: labourer, painter, bricklayer, and finally horseman,” he remembers fondly. “At the end of the shooting I stayed in the Canary Islands for six more months, working menial jobs to gather enough money for the return ticket.” A horsewoman training a young Andalusian horse in the streets of Oasys Mini Hollywood, a western-styled movie set Molina belongs to a small, fascinating community of local cowboys and stuntmen who have constantly been featured in movies and shows since the advent of the first productions in the 50s. Among the world’s best in their profession, they can perform anything from fistfights to horse drags and high-level falls. Most of them prefer to pass on their knowledge and skills from father to son, to keep the tricks of the trade within their family. Imbued in the classics of the European westerns’ golden era, they personify the values of their movie heroes: pride, bravado, freedom and a symbiotic relationship with horses. Ricardo Cruz Fernández (left) and Rafael Aparicio García are two professional stuntmen who have featured in several movies and music videos; they regularly work for Fort Bravo sets “I’ve always liked horses and the far west,” says Ricardo Cruz Fernández, 29, a stuntman and cowboy who has appeared in recent productions such as Game of Thrones, Ridley Scott’s Exodus: Gods and Kings and The Sisters Brothers, a 2018 Franco-American western starring Joaquin Phoenix. Fernández started his career as a cowboy after completing a stuntman course 10 years ago. Between productions, he performs daily shows at Fort Bravo for the thousands of western aficionados who visit the set every year. “I prefer to play the bad guy, because it gives me a wider range of possibilities. The good guy only has to keep things in order,” laughs Cruz Fernández. Stuntman Ricardo Cruz Fernández, 29, in the main street in Fort Bravo Cruz Fernández’s romance with the wild west started as a kid, after he fell in love with the Dollars trilogy – A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly – by the Italian director Sergio Leone, starring a young and still unknown Clint Eastwood as The Man with No Name. The films were all shot in the province of Almería. “Leone’s movies didn’t need many dialogues or intricate plots. The actors’ gestures, the music and the little details are enough to give you goosebumps,” explains Cruz Fernández. Thanks to its innovative shooting style and skilful balance of images and captivating soundtrack, the trilogy was at the forefront of “spaghetti westerns”, a broad sub-genre that became extremely popular in the 60s and 70s. Most of its directors were Italians, while producers and especially actors were an intricate blend of Italians, Spaniards and Americans, all acting in their own language. The ruins of the movie set of El Condor, a western movie shot in the 70s Snubbed by American critics at first, spaghetti westerns nonetheless became hugely successful thanks to the foreign, disenchanted vision they brought to a genre that had almost disappeared in America at that time. The wild west they depicted was a far cry from the epic of white conquest portrayed in the American classics. Their main characters were not champions of the defenceless, but amoral bounty hunters moved by personal profit, greed and vengeance. Actions and violence ruled, and the good rarely triumphed. Panoramic view of the Tabernas desert, where the western movie sets are located Although Almería had already been used as a shooting venue for a few renowned movies – among them Lawrence of Arabia and Cleopatra – it was Leone, and the ensuing flurry of European westerns, that finally brought the province’s stunning light and natural sets into the international spotlight. Since then, Almería has hosted more than 500 film productions, including blockbusters, and renowned TV series, from Patton to Terminator: Dark Fate and Doctor Who. “Our landscapes are very convenient. We have sea, desert and snow mountains all within a short distance,” says local producer Plácido Martínez. “We can serve as Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California and endless other natural settings.” Horses running wild in Fort Bravo When foreign western productions discovered Almería in the 60s, the province was one of the poorest in Spain, plagued by high unemployment and emigration. Despite its remoteness, production costs were extremely low and its inhabitants were skilled horsemen. Mostly dark-skinned, they were ideal stuntmen and extras for spaghetti westerns set on the border between the US and Mexico. “I was earning more money in one day than my father in one week of hard labour in the goldmine,” remembers Manuel Hernández Montoya, a 61-year-old hotel owner who worked as extra in several westerns when he was a child. Manuel Hernández Montoya, a 61-year-old former actor who played in spaghetti westerns in his childhood, stands on the ruins of Cortijo del Fraile, used in several famous films In the years that followed the success of A Fistful of Dollars, two open-air western sets – currently named Oasys Mini Hollywood and Western Leone – were built around Tabernas. The region hardly had any paved road at that time, and the cinema industry was instrumental in building Almería’s airport and first hotels. In just a few years, the city turned from a backwater to a European version of Hollywood, with celebrities such as Claudia Cardinale, Alain Delon and Charles Bronson sipping drinks by the Grand Hotel pool between shootings. Professional stuntman preparing a pile of hay before the show starts at Oasys Mini Hollywood A stuntman carrying hay on his back at the end of the working day The movie industry also boosted the international image of Francisco Franco, the dictator ruling Spain at that time. “The regime was very happy to welcome celebrities such as Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra or John Wayne,” says Evaristo Martínez, an Almería-based journalist and cinema expert. “Franco would facilitate international productions in any way, even those whose movies were censored locally.” Three professional stuntmen walk around Fort Bravo with their horses – all have appeared in several international movie productions The spaghetti western genre declined in the second half of the 70s due to overproduction, a sustained dip in quality and shifting interest from the public. The setback was a heavy blow for the local cinema industry. Thousands of jobs were lost and the western decors fell into disrepair. Abandoned by their owners, they were kept functioning by a few stuntmen, who started offering western shows for tourists in order to make ends meet. When Molina bought Fort Bravo for just $6,000, the decor was in ruins. It took him months of hard labour to bring it back to its former splendour. After hosting a few big productions in the 80s – including Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Conan the Barbarian, the movie that launched Arnold Schwarzenegger’s international career – Almería’s cinema industry picked up again in the following decade. Westerns would never regain the prominence of the golden years, but locals still feel deeply bound to them. “Western movies have definitely changed the fate of our province, from the 50s up until now,” continues Martínez, the producer. “In the past eight years they have enjoyed a huge revival all over the world.” A French can-can show performed at the saloon in Oasys Mini Hollywood Every year, Tabernas holds a western festival that attracts thousands of visitors from every corner of the world. Specialised tour agencies guide visitors through the remote canyons and mountains where their favourite movies were shot. “I once had a tourist who came all the way from Japan just to take selfies in every location of the trilogy wearing Clint Eastwood’s poncho,” remembers Cristina Serena Seguí, manager of the Malcamino’s agency. Nowhere is the connection between westerns and Almería more striking than on the sets’ dusty roads. To stand amid these old wooden houses, discoloured by the burning sun and beaten by mountain winds, is a unique experience. It brings us into a timeless past, back to the adventurous cowboys’ world we all dreamed about when we were kids. Despite its roughness, the wild west’s image of a free and simple society is an alluring alternative to our hyper-regulated modern world, made of countless rules and limitations. “Western movies are so successful because everyone can understand them. You kill me, I kill you,” says Molina. “There are no politics, no systemic injustice involved, and those who do something bad must pay. That’s very different from those movies about Wall Street millionaire gangsters operating within the law. What message do they send to society?” Stuntmen playing a western movie scene at Oasys Mini Hollywood set Western movies’ simplicity and universal values are one of the reasons why they will never go out of fashion. Quentin Tarantino’s movies are filled with references to the genre, and two of his more recent films, Django Unchained and The Hateful Eight, can be considered modern spaghetti westerns. “Western movies tell the creation of a country and a society from scratch. They represent the history of mankind,” adds Martínez, the producer. Discovered by a bunch of visionary directors and dirty, dusty cowboys, Almería underwent the same metamorphosis described in those films, becoming a modern, real-life homage to the wild west. Although Almería’s fame as a shooting destination has gone well beyond westerns – Black Mirror, Blade Runner 2049 and Wonder Woman 1984 were all shot here recently – its western sets still host dozens of productions every year. “I don’t think I will ever be able to retire,” says Molina, laughing. “That’s OK to me, because it would mean giving up my happiness.” Molina ended acting long ago, after an almost fatal accident forced him to choose between his family and his beloved career. Yet he reckons he will never be able to quit Fort Bravo. A manly and passionate dreamer, he blends perfectly in the suspended atmosphere of this imaginary frontier town, where man and wild nature are one. “I used to spend my summer nights here, right at the centre of the Mexican square,” he concludes with wet eyes. “I would lay down on my back and watch the sky. There are so many stars it is impossible to count them all.”",Arts/Film,The other wild west in the Spanish desert – photo essay,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/14/the-other-wild-west-in-the-spanish-desert-photo-essay
3/14/2022,"The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has warned that government plans to address labour market abuses by umbrella companies are inadequate, amid signs that thousands of temporary workers may be being denied pay and basic rights. As many as 600,000 temporary workers in the UK are thought to be employed by umbrella companies – used by recruitment agencies and companies to cut temporary payroll costs, which are usually charged as fees to the workers instead. The problem costs workers and the government as much as £4.5bn in fraud and misappropriation, according to estimates recognised by the government. The government is working on new rules for the temporary labour market as evidence has mounted of unscrupulous umbrella companies taking advantage of workers. In a response to a government consultation the TUC has said the business department’s Employment Agencies Standards Inspectorate (EASI), which may be tasked with enforcing the new regulations, has less than a fifth of the officers needed under UN standards. Under current proposals, independent contractors who are not classed as “agency workers” could still fall outside the scope of regulation, despite being forced to use umbrellas, the TUC said. The use of umbrella companies has increased significantly, including in the NHS and the education system, since the government changed tax rules for contractors. The Guardian last year found evidence of possible umbrella company tax dodging in the test-and-trace programme. The union body, which repeated its call for a ban on umbrellas, cited abuses such as a locum physiotherapist in London who did not receive pay for five weeks of work from his umbrella company employer. The worker had been forced by the NHS trust to sign up to the umbrella, but neither the trust, the recruitment agency or the umbrella will take responsibility for the loss of wages, the TUC said. Other workers have said how they were denied holiday pay by umbrella companies that did not inform them of their rights until it was too late. Frances O’Grady, the TUC’s general secretary, said: “It has long been clear that our lack of regulation lets dodgy umbrella companies off the hook – allowing them to act with impunity and treat workers appallingly. “But the government’s proposals fall far short of what’s needed. Hundreds of thousands of workers using umbrella arrangements might miss out on protection because they aren’t agency workers. And there aren’t enough inspectors to make sure companies stick to the rules. “Tinkering around the edges won’t cut it. It’s time for a ban on umbrella companies.” Rebecca Seeley Harris, a tax expert and former senior adviser to the Treasury, said umbrella companies “need to be regulated and sooner rather than later” but said she did not believe they should be banned, to allow businesses flexibility. “In an ideal world, maybe umbrella companies would not be needed but, such is the complexity of hiring someone off-payroll, umbrella companies have found a place in the labour supply chain,” Seeley Harris said. “Unfortunately, the government has failed to take notice of this market despite being warned of the need to regulate and now bad practices have been allowed to develop.”",News/Law,"Government plans let ‘dodgy umbrella companies off the hook’, warns TUC",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/14/government-plans-let-dodgy-umbrella-companies-off-the-hook-warns-tuc
3/14/2022,"On my road trip, taking in cities and villages waiting for the Russian onslaught, I meet Oleksandr Senkevych, the mayor of the industrial city of Mykolaiv, near the Black Sea in southern Ukraine. We first met some years ago at a fancy business school. “Our city could be like Hamburg. That’s our role model,” he said then, explaining his strategy to reinvigorate the famous port. The pre-Dreadnought battleship Potemkin – known for the crew rebellion in 1905, in the lead-up to the Russian revolution – was built in the local shipyards.Senkevych was a businessman elected in a suit in 2015 after the Euromaidan revolution; the youngest mayor in Ukraine, praised for fighting corruption. Now, with more than 1,500 Russian units of military equipment brought from the occupied Crimea surrounding the town from the east and north, he is a war leader. The Russians have already occupied some of the villages 20km away. Only the Pivdennyi Buh river that divides Mykolaiv saves it from blockade, but the Russians may soon build a pontoon bridge to the north to close the circle.It is key to Moscow’s aspirations, for by controlling Mykolaiv, Moscow would be able to approach Odesa, 80 miles to its west, and then the Ukrainian land border up to Transnistria – the breakaway republic of Moldova. “The only road from Mykolaiv is to Odesa – it is our lifeline, that’s how we’re evacuating people,” he tells me. “There are 250,000 out of 500,000 left. The task is to move another 50,000 – the rest won’t agree to be relocated.” He greets me, wearing a bulletproof vest and holding a gun, in the city council building. The exterior is designed to resemble Buckingham Palace.An estimated 27 civilians have already died in this area, killed by shelling. Hundreds of houses have been damaged, some fully destroyed. The administration’s task now is to fix the electricity and water supply, but just as important is the race to stockpile provisions, medicine and water for at least a few months of a possible blockade. Kherson, the bigger town on the east, is already occupied by Russian forces. The population there gathers on a daily basis for peaceful demonstrations with their Ukrainian flags. In Mykolaiv, meanwhile, they are preparing for guerrilla street war if the invading Russians make it there.We are all people of war now. Before the war, the mayor’s press official was, like the president, a successful standup comedian, but now the Kalashnikov automatic rifle on his shoulder doesn’t look unnatural. The last time we met was four months ago, in a spacious art gallery in Mykolaiv on the riverbank. Needs must. Another city council member carries his gun in a tennis racket case. In his prewar life, he also chaired a regional Olympic committee.As I put on my flak jacket, he notes that I am handling it “as if I had experience”. This might be seen as a compliment, but I have seen wars abroad and reported on the conflict in eastern Ukraine. It is the politicians-turned-wartime leaders who are having to learn new skills.But then so many people are having to see things differently. Until recently, Russia controlled 7% of Ukrainian territory. A million people were internally displaced, 14,000 were killed, but it was still possible for the majority not to know where the battlefield was.It was we who covered the war, helped civilians, fled the region or fought the battles, who sometimes felt at odds with that everyday reality of peaceful towns. We wondered how ordinary people saw us. Did they think us neurotic? Did we have PTSD? Should we refrain from discussing the war with the rest of a country that just wanted to get on with living?But the distinction is being shot to pieces. Many now understand the real ugliness of war, a fact that only becomes truly clear when you hear the airstrike yourself or need to flee to safety.“I was sitting in my house and saw two black planes. I was paralysed: what should I do?” Nadia said, sitting near the debris of her house in Balabanovka in Mykolaiv’s suburbs. Her neighbour’s building was hit. Her husband, a man in his 60s, relates it all and cries. They are the only ones left in the area now. Up to a dozen houses around them have been destroyed.Moving on to Odesa’s train station, I see a few hundred women and children from Mykolaiv and its outskirts waiting for the trains to western Ukraine, to Romania, to Slovakia and Poland – to anywhere the trains might go. The Ukrainian railway moved more than 6,000 of the most vulnerable residents of Mykolaiv this week.How they are coping matters, because in the minds of many Ukrainians, Mykolaiv is a symbol of resistance. First because of its successful defence of airports and airfields, and for the bravery of the local military commander. But also because of the local governor, Vitaliy Kim. A half-Korean Russian speaker and a successful developer before war enveloped everything, he has been bolstering people’s morale with cheerful video diaries that are popular on the internet. When Kim calls residents to bring tyres to the city streets to block the path of Russian tanks and promises that “the smoke of rubber will hinder the enemy”, the next day the town is littered with tyres.We need to hit the road again, to leave Mykolaiv while the drawbridge on the way to Odesa is still open, and to get there before the curfew. The mayor and his team advise me to get out. They do not know what the next night will bring. It feels like a betrayal to leave, but leave they say we must. As for them, “We would fight. We are ready,” they say.I have been taught that when interviewing in a conflict zone, it is a kindness to try to end an interview on a positive note and ask about the future. But it’s hard to be optimistic when you think about what may come soon. The Russian advance has been slowing, but that could merely mean that the terrorising of the population from the skies with deadly shells could last for a while. Attacks from the air and on the ground; a sense of siege.“So how about Mykolaiv becoming Hamburg after the war,” I ask the mayor. “I do not think so any more,” he says. “We were promised the Marshall plan for Ukraine after the war. But I am not sure anything on that scale is coming. We’ll rebuild what we can. But what we need now is more bulletproof vests and helmets. Pass the message.”We “people of war” were a minority for so long. Now there are more than 40 million of us. Our focus now is on how we can stop this advance.

3/14/2022,"You can put up to £20,000 in an investment Isa before 6 April and you won’t pay tax on the profits. Choosing a fund rather than individual stocks and shares means you can invest in dozens of companies and spread your risk, while targeting inflation-beating returns. The stock market may be your only chance of keeping pace with the rising cost of living, if you can hold your nerve when markets face a bumpy ride. But as a general rule of thumb, the sooner you need your money, the less risk you should take, as you won’t have as much time to ride out the highs and lows of the market. Laura Suter, the head of personal finance at AJ Bell, says: “Someone’s pension that they don’t plan to touch for 30 years will have different funds from an investment pot that’ll go towards a new car in five years’ time.” There are plenty of ways to assess a fund’s risk. It may be gauged, for example, by how sharply its performance moves up and down, shown on a graph on the investment provider’s website. If you’re happy taking a relatively high level of risk, you can choose a fund solely invested in shares. But if you want to reduce risk, a fund invested in a variety of assets, including corporate and government bonds and some cash, may be more suitable. Investment Isas are available from high street banks and investment providers, but with thousands of funds to choose from, knowing where to start can be daunting. However, there are lots of experts who follow performance and their guidance can help you narrow down your choices. You can find lists of expert fund picks on a variety of websites, alongside a variety of research tools if you want to dig any deeper into a particular fund. For example, check out Interactive Investor’s Super 60, Hargreaves Lansdown’s Wealth Shortlist, Fidelity’s Tom’s Picks and AJ Bell’s Favourite Funds. The funds highlighted on these sites often consistently outperform, and are generally considered a solid choice for any investor. You can also check a fund’s rating on the Morningstar and Trustnet websites. For example, Morningstar awards ratings based on past performance, and analysts’ gold, silver, bronze, neutral or negative ratings that give an idea of how well they expect the fund to perform in future. A multi-asset fund that holds companies from around the world is a good option if you want to keep things simple and just invest in one fund. “If you choose a broad global fund invested in lots of different countries and types of companies, it will be more diversified and so less likely to react extremely negatively to bad news or one market falling,” says Suter. These are essentially a diversified investment portfolio within a single fund. Interactive Investor’s Quick-start funds include three of Vanguard’s LifeStrategy funds and BMO Sustainable funds, with options for cautious and more adventurous investors. Emma Wall, head of investment analysis and research at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: “For one-stop-shop funds, we like … Troy Trojan which hold stocks, bonds, cash and gold, and Schroder Managed Balanced which alongside stocks and bonds also invests in property and alternatives.” You may have a particular sector that you want to invest in, such as renewable energy providers or smaller companies, or you may want to invest in a fund focused in a specific region. But remember that these types of funds are generally best as part of a portfolio, with other investments that aren’t focused on the same thing. “Investing all your cash into a UK smaller companies fund means that when the sector falls out of favour, you’re up against it, however talented the fund manager,” says Wall. Many investors start with a multi-asset fund, or an index tracker that follows the performance of a particular market, such as the MSCI World, or FTSE 100, and add other funds to this over time. You can find the objectives of a fund on its fund factsheet, available from investment websites, from Trustnet.com or from the company selling the fund. This will show the top 10 companies the fund invests in and enable you to gauge how it has performed. How much you pay for your fund can make a huge difference to your returns over time. Trackers are the cheapest option because no one has to make a decision about the investments. As active funds come with a manager who chooses which shares to buy, with the aim of beating the market, they’re more expensive. Average charges on active funds are about 0.75% a year (although they can be as high as 1.5%), but you can pay as a little as 0.1% for an index tracker. Remember you’ll also pay a fee to the investment provider you buy the fund from, but how much you pay often depends on the range of investment choice. Vanguard is one of the cheapest, at just 0.15% a year, but offers limited choice. Fidelity usually charges 0.35% a year, and you can choose from a wide range of funds. If you’re lucky enough to have some cash to invest, make sure you do so before 6 April - if you don’t use your Isa allowance by the end of the tax year you lose it. Myron Jobson, a senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor, says: “Your money will also be in the market longer if it’s put to work sooner, and while markets will have good years and bad, over the long term this increases your potential for profits.” If you’re nervous of investing your Isa allowance in the market because this money will be tied up for some time, and the cost of living is rising, that’s not necessarily a reason to delay. You can start small by investing just £25 a month into your chosen fund. This way, you buy more shares when the stock market is performing badly, and fewer when their value rises, which can help to even out performance over time, too. Should you choose to open an Isa and set up a regular payment like this, you will only be making a small contribution in this tax year. Future monthly payments into it will come out of the allowance for the tax year they are made in. At any point in the tax year you can move money from a cash Isa into a stocks and shares version, or vice versa – as long as the new provider takes transfers.",Lifestyle/Money,Stocks and shares Isas: how to choose where to invest,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/14/stocks-and-shares-isas-invest-funds
3/14/2022,"Q Our question is a simple one: should we pay off our mortgage or use our savings to improve the house? We recently sold a separate property that I used for work and cannot decide what to do with the proceeds of the sale. Our home would certainly benefit from some improvements (we live in a wet and windy rural location). However, with the increase in costs of construction and supplies, we are concerned that this is not the time to undertake such work. In light of the expected increase in interest rates and continued rise in the cost of living, what do you think is the best choice? The savings from clearing the mortgage are minimal and it would take us many years to build up such a nest egg again. My wife and I are going back and forth with this almost daily.DT A If your house is in need of essential repairs to make it weatherproof, now most definitely is the right time to get on with the work, whatever the price. The main reason for this is that under your buildings insurance you have a responsibility to keep your property in a good state of repair. If you don’t and something happens to your house – the roof is blown off in a storm because you have not kept it in good condition, for example – your insurance won’t cover you for the costs of repairing it. Keeping your property up to scratch also makes it a more comfortable place to live and can reduce what you have to spend on heating. However, if the home improvements are more desirable than essential, I would be tempted to get a quote for the work before making a decision. It may well be that the proceeds from selling your work premises can go towards both home improvements and reducing your mortgage. On a more serious note, you may need to put some of the proceeds towards paying any capital gains tax due, which needs to happen within 60 days of selling the property. You’ll need to set up a capital gains tax account on the HM Revenue and Customs website.  Want expert help finding your new mortgage?

3/14/2022,"Immigration lawyer Samantha Murozoki did not plan to be still cooking for her neighbourhood two years after she first gave out some spare sadza porridge to hungry children in her street. Murozoki made headlines at the start of the Covid pandemic when the number of people queueing outside her small home kitchen in Chitungwiza, a town on the outskirts of Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare, quickly reached the thousands. Now, even though the number of people struggling to find food each day has eased in line with Zimbabwe’s lockdown measures, which have allowed people to return to work, Murozoki, 34, continues to feed nearly 800 people daily. “I feel like I cannot just start something like this and close the doors,” she says. “I do not know how I am still going on after so many days.” After an initial rush of small donations from well-wishers, providing a plate of sadza (Zimbabwe’s porridge-like staple made from boiled maize flour, also known as mealie meal) and beans to everyone in need every day has not been easy, and Murozoki has used her own and her mother’s money to feed people. “People have donated and have done their part, now they wait on us to do something bigger,” she says. “Last month, we had two consecutive days when we did not serve because we didn’t have mealie meal. We also have days where we have to cut the number of people we serve based on what we have. “Right now the only help that I get is from regular citizens from Zimbabwe and in other countries. It might not be on a regular basis but whenever they can, they bring something through. “We have a few companies that come and donate food. When we do not have anything to give, my mum and I make the financial input to make sure there is something. Whenever we do not have it completely, we close our doors and do not serve.” Sign up for Her Stage to hear directly from incredible women in the developing world on the issues that matter to them, delivered to your inbox monthly: Last year more than 2 million Zimbabweans in cities struggled to buy enough to eat as food prices rose and businesses closed. As the effects of the pandemic continue to be felt, many families still rely on food aid. Zimbabwe’s president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, has now partially opened up the manufacturing and mining sectors, but millions of informal workers face restricted business hours. While feeding the hungry in Chitungwiza has made an impact, Murozoki wants to do more for the community where she was born. “I need for us to graduate to the next level. I want to say I fed people and ended up empowering those people. I do not want this memory to end after serving two meals a day, but I want to be able to give people an education and empower them,” she says. It is 1pm on a Tuesday in Chitungwiza and Murozoki is supervising volunteers making lunch. An elderly woman is stirring sadza in a big pot helped by 17-year-old Martin, who pours in the grain. Martin dropped out of school in grade seven when his parents split up. He wants to become a driver and Murozoki has offered to fund his return to school. Martin is one of 19 young people who came under Murozoki’s care via the relief kitchen, she says, and now she is appealing, through the organisation she set up, the Kuchengetana Trust, for land to build a place to house abandoned children. “Someone needs to buy into the vision of how I want to remodel Kuchengetana Trust. The relief kitchen should stand as an emergency plan. We want to deal with recurring cases of poverty,” she says. “The reason I want a piece of land is for our piggery and fish project so they can raise funds to build a home for children that I am taking care of. I want them to stay under one roof so that I can help them effectively. From these 19 children will grow a new crop of Zimbabwean, someone who is enterprising. “But we do not have a ladder to move to that point. All we want is [to be] self-sustaining,” she says. Murozoki has had Covid twice. “The second time was quite bad. I thought it would be mild but it hit me pretty hard so I was out for about three weeks because of it but luckily my mum is always here. She made sure that people had something to eat. I lost quite a number of donations too.” Taking time out to rest was tricky; her mother is old and the number of volunteers is falling. “We have had a huge drop in the number of volunteers due to lack of incentives. People want to go out there and get something in their pockets.” She misses spending more time with her two sons. “I struggle to balance my personal life and the trust. I don’t have a social life. If I’m not here, I will be out there looking for donations. This has affected the time that I spend with my children. I feel bad, for example if my child gets sick, for committing to nursing them, it will be difficult to ignore the work,” she says.",News/Global development,‘I don’t know how I’m still going’: what’s next for the woman who fed thousands in Zimbabwe’s lockdown?,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/14/samantha-murozoki-whats-next-for-the-woman-who-fed-thousands-in-zimbabwe-lockdown
3/14/2022,"My partner and I bought two pairs of Chore walking boots from the Original Muck Boot Company, but soon after we started wearing them we noticed they were breaking up. The inside heel is wearing away on both pairs, and the seal around the foot has come away so water bubbles in when we’re walking through wet fields. They were expensive so we were very disappointed. I contacted Muck Boot and supplied photographic evidence. It agreed to refund both pairs, but it did not want the boots returned. Instead, it asked us to cut a large slit through them to render them unwearable. Although hesitant due to the apparent disregard for waste, I cut both pairs, and sent photos, to enable the refund. Since then, I have sent emails chasing, but I haven’t heard anything back. I am concerned the company is shirking its responsibility after agreeing to a refund, and now I am sat with two pairs of destroyed boots, and over £200 worse off. RF, by email Muck Boot’s products are expensive but they generally get good reviews online and have loyal fans among the dog-walking fraternity. I asked the company to investigate, and it swiftly moved to put things right.

3/14/2022,"The pandemic locked us down, but at the same time freed many workers from the confines of the office. A new breed of digital nomads emerged – people who took their laptops, jumped on planes and set up shop in some of the most beautiful parts of the world. And with them have come schemes to make it easier for them to stay for months on end. Barbados was one of the first countries to formalise arrangements with its “welcome stamp”, launched in June 2020. To qualify, workers must earn more than US$50,000 (£37,000) during the 12 months they are in the country and pay $2,000 for the application. They will not be subject to income tax while they are there. In June last year, Malta launched a nomad residence permit, with which workers can live in the country once they earn €2,700 (£2,230) a month. Applicants pay €300 each, plus the same for each dependant. Iceland has operated a long-term visa for remote workers since October 2020, and Bermuda has a new “work from Bermuda” certificate. Spain and Sri Lanka have plans to follow suit. The schemes all run in a fairly similar fashion: workers pay to apply and get the right to stay in the country while working for an employer based elsewhere. The visas typically last a year, which can usually be extended once the time is up. Once you have one in place, you can rent a property and travel in and out of the country. However, there are things to bear in mind before you pack your bag. “Being a digital nomad can be made to work. However, it is seldom as straightforward as people sometimes think,” says Lee McIntyre-Hamilton of Keystone Law, who specialises in global mobility. “Obtaining a visa is just the start of the process.” Alex Lilburn, a software developer, moved from the UK to Barbados in January 2021 after making his application for the welcome stamp. “I saw a piece on the BBC headlined something like: Working remotely? You could be working from paradise,” he says. The article mentioned Barbados, so he started looking into the practicalities. “I worked from home before, but suddenly there was no expectation from clients that we would turn up once a month,” he says. “I spoke to my employer . They were very supportive and said if there were no tax implications, they would help make it happen.” If you are employed, you may be contractually obliged to work where your employer says, and being overseas might not be an option. Moving away could trigger obligations for your company, says McIntyre-Hamilton, such as the payment of social security contributions in the new country. “For example, if a UK citizen and employee of a UK company went to live and work in Spain indefinitely, they would immediately trigger an obligation for their UK employer to register as a foreign employer and operate a payroll there,” he says. Your presence may also prompt a corporate presence for the company overseas and, with it, demands for corporate tax. So this is not something you can do without consulting with your employer. It’s more straightforward if you are self-employed, but you should talk to your clients, says McIntyre-Hamilton, as in some cases contractors – especially when they only have one client – could be considered an employee under different rules in the new country. Barbados offers a zero income tax rate for those on its welcome stamp, but you will pay VAT on goods and services. Lilburn is paid by his employer in the UK, and it takes out income tax and national insurance as if he was still working at home. In general, tax rules around residency are complicated, especially if you are travelling for a short period and may make trips back to the UK. Whether or not you pay tax in the UK depends on whether you are a UK tax resident. Broadly, HM Revenue & Customs says that if you are in the UK for 183 days or more in a tax year, you are resident. But residency is complicated and travellers should go through the statutory residence test for clarity. “If an individual remains a UK resident when they are living and working overseas, HMRC will continue to tax any income that the individual earns while they are living and working overseas,” says McIntyre-Hamilton. You may also be subject to taxes in the country you are staying in – leading to the possibility of being taxed twice, although there are exemptions where there is a double tax treaty with the UK. Even if you are not resident in the UK, any money sourced there – such as bank interest, dividends or rental income – will typically be subject to UK income tax. “I have seen some evidence of digital nomads moving from country to country in the expectation that this will avoid triggering issues in any one country. Generally, this assumption is incorrect,” says McIntyre-Hamilton. Lilburn has no intention of moving. It’s great work-wise, he says: the time difference is currently four hours, and he has meetings in the morning when his UK colleagues are at their desks, then does his coding work in the afternoon. He recently renewed his welcome stamp for another year, which was slightly cheaper than the original application, at $1,500, and says he can see no reason why he won’t do the same again next year. “I came to Barbados for the scenery and weather, but I’m staying for the people – whether it’s the other people on the visa, who are similar people at the same life stage, or the Bajans I’ve met who have been so friendly,” he says. “It’s amazing, it really is.” Lauren Anders Brown is a documentary maker who was visiting her partner in Bermuda in March 2020 when the pandemic hit. She ended up staying, and that summer, applied for the island’s digital nomad visa. “It costs $285 to apply but it was simple,” she says. “You have to prove your overseas company pays you into a bank account, that you are paying your taxes, and that you have health insurance.” She’s self-employed with Collaborate: ideas & images, in the UK. She earns into accounts in the UK and the US, where she is originally from, and uses accountants to make sure she has paid the right tax. Her partner is a doctor, and applied for a traditional working visa. “It was a hell of a lot easier for me to stay than him,” she says, “because the digital nomad visa is a new kind of immigration law.” Non-residents are not allowed to drive, but under the scheme she is. She was also able to rent a place to live while he was still getting his visa approved. Bermuda’s only downside is it is expensive. The visa lasts a year and she has renewed it. “There’s blue water, it’s dog-friendly – it really suits us,” she says.",Lifestyle/Money,Blue-sky thinking: new rules allow digital nomads to work in the sun,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/14/blue-sky-thinking-new-rules-allow-digital-nomads-to-work-in-the-sun
3/14/2022,"In early 2019, an 18-year-old Saudi woman, Rahaf Mohammed, snuck out of her family hotel room in Kuwait and bought a plane ticket to Bangkok, beginning the most extraordinary journey of her young life. The welcome she received, however, met her deepest fears. With her father and brother in hot pursuit, and Thai airport authorities, working in collaboration with the Saudi embassy, all determined to send her back, Mohammed barricaded herself in an airport hotel room, took a deep breath and decided to tell her story to the world. Using the smartphone that had been her only respite from a windowless, repressive existence in the conservative heartland of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed detailed her plight in a series of posts on Twitter. If she was forcibly returned, she would disappear or be killed, she wrote. She needed immediate help to apply for asylum. The maelstrom that followed involved the governments of five countries as well as the UN, drawing the attention of the world’s media to a vulnerable woman at a stark impasse in a faraway land. In the weeks and months that followed, her ordeal also cast a spotlight on her homeland: a place where “rebels” such as her are still the source of immense shame and young women remain barely seen or heard. In regional Saudi Arabia, the cultural reforms announced over the past five years are yet to cut through. Archaic traditions that have kept women as chattels remain steadfast beliefs among Rahaf’s family. Her brothers in the city of Ha’il played with friends on the streets, made their own decisions and monitored her phones. Rahaf, meanwhile, couldn’t sit on a balcony, go to the mall without a male guardian, or even speak in the GP’s clinic. From the age of nine, she was fully covered in a shapeless black abaya and niqab, anonymous to the rest of the world, and condemned to a small, ambitionless life, the course of which she had little role in shaping. When she cut her hair short, spoke back in class and was caught kissing girls, all her mother’s fears were realised. Slapped, abused, dragged from school and hidden away, Rahaf was treated as a family curse. Her father, meanwhile, took a second wife, then a third, both much younger than their anguished mother, who seemed to wreak her wrath on her rebellious daughter. In a debut book, aptly titled Rebel, Mohammed details a confused and often painful childhood that had no place for a free spirit such as hers. Indoctrinated into Wahabist beliefs that offered no room for critical thinking and viewed emancipation as a subversion punishable by stoning or death, she was miserable from an early age. And even more so when she caught glimpses of how other girls lived: on trips to Turkey and Dubai, she saw foreigners, the curves of women wearing dresses, and found music and laughter. She dared to dream that the same freedoms could be hers. As a teenager, she began to test her boundaries at home in Saudi Arabia. More beatings from her brothers followed. She was ostracised; and further tormented by her own blooming sexuality. Then one night, on a taxi ride home, she was raped. The driver rapist drove off knowing he would face no consequences. If her ordeal was known, she would be blamed for travelling without a guardian and possibly cursed by a family already out of patience with her. Soon afterwards, Rahaf made the decision to leave. The small screen that acted as her lifeline to the world helped to connect her with others who had escaped, a few Saudi girls who had managed to break the shackles and start independent lives abroad. Rahaf began making plans, and the next family holiday – to Kuwait – was the time to put them in motion. In nearly 300 pages of simple but effective prose, Rahaf Mohammed turns her journey into one that vast numbers of women in Saudi Arabia will relate to. There is nothing pretentious about her writing, and nor does there need to be. Lifting the veil on the repression of women – even in upper-middle-class families such as hers – is rare in the kingdom, a place in which dissent, towards the state and family structures, is not tolerated. Mohammed brings alive her austere classrooms, the rages of her domineering brothers, the desires of girls like her and the sorrow of such oppression. Her story is that of many more without a voice who cannot rise above their circumstances. She speaks for them in a dignified, raw manner. From a new home in Canada, disowned by her Saudi family, Mohammed is living the life she more or less wants. She misses her family, though, and cannot return to the kingdom. The threats she fled from remain real now. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, for all its talk of female empowerment and rule of law, still has a long way to go. This book may help things along.

Time to hand over the toddler and have a go myself, as our archery instructor, Lucas, shows me how it’s done. This is one of many family activities at the uber-chic Hof van Saksen family resort, in the Drenthe province of the Netherlands. Holiday resorts and their well-established brand of organised fun have never really been my thing – I much prefer a cottage or villa off the beaten track, with a small village nearby for provisions, and a local beach. But when we arrive at Hof van Saksen – one of the most luxurious options on offer from Landal GreenParks – I am ready to be converted. The first impressions are so warm that I almost ask our host, Ingrid Poppinger, if she wants to take care of our children for a week, too. But then I would miss out on all the fun. From the minute we arrive to the moment we regrettably have to leave, we exist in a glossy magazine advert. Bickering, nagging, tiredness, work worries … gone! They’re all lost in a flurry of waterslides, archaeology digs, beach games, archery challenges, outdoor cinema and woodwork sessions. Our farmhouse-style property has a thatched roof and inside is all cool greys and whites. The gorgeously furnished children’s bedrooms come complete with a box of toys and a beautiful wooden draughts set – and there’s a cute little shed for our bikes, which panders to my husband’s need for order. Yes, it is achingly stylish and perfect Instagram fodder. But it is also exceptionally practical, and the traditional games keep our children occupied for hours. This is now their world. My husband and I become semi-useful guests, providing sustenance. Other properties on the site, set around a sand-fringed lake and village greens, are mostly occupied by Dutch, German and Belgian families with one thing in common, according to Poppinger: “These are families that expect a little bit more from their holidays!” Laura Riley, who runs Little Clogs Holidays, an online travel company which specialises in child-friendly holidays to the Netherlands and Belgium, says Landal GreenParks resorts generally feel “less commercialised and more laid-back” than other, similar resorts. Other points of difference are that many activities are included in the price, and that the accommodation is less uniform and more adapted to its natural environment. We easily overfill our days signing up for activities at the academies scattered around the plattegrond (resort plan), including cookery, paddleboarding and canoeing, along with raft-building, bouncing, crafting and climbing. There is an app to keep track of activities each day, but popular activities need booking in advance. We also make good use of the resort’s lakeside beach, with its free loungers and deckchairs. A wooden educational play area fascinates Seb and Jemima as they try to build a dam, and an enormous inflatable bouncing mat keeps us all entertained. On some afternoons there is an opportunity for me to have quality one-on-one time with Seb, including at the archaeology academy. On arrival we are handed a trowel, small brush and kneeling mat with strict instructions to note down all our discoveries in our archaeology passport. Buried in our sand-covered plot are the remnants of existing and prehistoric animals. Budding palaeontologist Seb could not beam any more brightly when his bison bones are showcased in the resort’s own archaeology museum. Apart from timetabled activities, there is a soft play centre for rainy days, a bowling alley, mini golf, exercise classes for adults, and of course the pool, with its variety of age- and height-appropriate water slides. For parents, there is also a spa and wellbeing area, with a Finnish sauna. One day, we decide to give ourselves a break from self-catering and sample an on-site restaurant in the Havezate (main building). We opt for the Italian Gusto over the slightly pricier self-service Al Fresco restaurant. Once the kids have finished, they are occupied by a giant, wall-mounted Lego board while we relax over our meal in surroundings not dissimilar to a city centre restaurant. Enormous detail has gone in to perfecting the family holiday experience, from the stunning art on the walls and the sculptures dotted across the gardens (all for sale, should you wish to part with thousands of euros) to the child-height banisters and the foot-golf course running across the grassed areas between houses. So the absence of British people at the resort remains a bit of a mystery. “These resorts are so close by and easy to get to without needing to fly,” says Riley. “But people just haven’t really heard of them. I think it goes hand in hand with the Netherlands not yet being such an obvious family holiday destination.” Riley started Little Clogs with her friend Jane Grove in 2018. The two are mothers of, respectively, half-Belgian and half-Dutch children, and realised there was more to those countries than city breaks. “A lot of the family holidays available tend to be in Mediterranean destinations, which are more difficult to get to, and temperatures can often be too hot when you have young children. So the Netherlands is perfect in many ways – for such a small country it is rich in diversity, with some of the most stunning beaches in Europe, beautiful woodlands and dunes, and the temperatures are appealing,” she says. This was the second time we’d holidayed in the Netherlands – this time in our own car, via an overnight P&O Ferry from Hull to Rotterdam. It made a much more sustainable, exciting and relaxing way to travel. My husband, a fellow journalist and fan of listicles, occasionally asks our son to name the top five days of his life. Christmas Day is second on that list; his sixth birthday a close third. First, every time and without hesitation, is the day he went on the water rapids ride eight times in a row at Hof van Saksen. Hof van Saksen can be booked via Little Clogs Holidays, where a week’s stay costs from €712.60 including tourist taxes, based on two adults, a child and a baby.
