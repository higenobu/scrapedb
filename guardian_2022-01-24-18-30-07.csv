1/24/2022,"With just over a week’s worth of unedifying wrangling left to go in the current transfer window, the coming days promise to be punctuated with no end of rumours and counter-rumours as the last-ditch horse-trading ramps up. Now in Saudi Arabia for warm weather training, team bonding and other quite specific football reasons, Newcastle’s already long shopping list got a little longer during Saturday’s hard-fought win over Leeds, as first Joelinton, then Jamaal Lascelles and finally Paul Dummett limped off with various injuries that could keep them sidelined for the coming weeks. Unwanted by Tottenham, where his decline over the past two seasons has been little short of remarkable, Dele Alli’s “people” are reported to have opened talks with Newcastle on the subject of a loan or permanent move to St James‘ Park. The Magpies remain confident of securing central defender Diego Carlos from Sevilla, who are all too aware of the Premier League club’s desperation for new recruits and are holding out for far more than the £30m currently being offered presumably in the hope of getting far more when the inevitable panic sets in.  Having already bought Chris Wood from Burnley, Newcastle are now giving James Tarkowski the glad eye and also hope to measure up Brighton midfielder Yves Bissouma for a club blazer in the coming days. Unsettled Arsenal reserve goalkeeper Bernd Leno remains on their radar but may prefer a move to Inter, who are also interested in securing his services. And in the last of today’s news pertaining to Newcastle, the names of Bayer Leverkusen left-back Mitchel Bakker and Atalanta striker Duvan Zapata continue to be mentioned in conjunction with potential moves to the north east. West Ham are rumoured to be lining up a “shock” £60m bid for England striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, in a prospective deal that seems unlikely considering it would further enrage already extremely disgruntled Everton fans and almost certainly lead to scenes of outright mutiny in the stands of Goodison Park. The Hammers had been keen on signing Adama Traoré from Wolves but have cooled their interest now he looks certain to sign for Spurs. Meanwhile at the Emirates, Arsenal have upped their bid for Dusan Vlahovic to just shy of £60m but the Fiorentina striker is reported to be holding out for a move to Manchester City, even though Juventus are also interested in getting him on board. Chelsea’s ongoing search for a left-back to fill in for the injured Ben Chilwell continues and Stuttgart’s Borna Sosa is the latest to be linked with a move to Stamford Bridge. No relation to Kaiser from The Usual Suspects, the 24-year-old Croatian would cost them £25m. Currently deputising for Chilwell, Marcos Alonso is wanted by Atlético Madrid and may fancy playing out his twilight years in the Spanish capital – where he grew up – in the unlikely event that Chelsea are willing to let him go. Connor Goldson looks set to leave Ibrox when he becomes a free agent next summer, with Nottingham Forest and West Brom both interested in taking him south of the border. The Rangers defender is free to discuss his future with interested parties outside Scotland this month and has shown no inclination to sign a new deal with his current employers. And finally, Everton have interviewed Vítor Pereira for their vacant manager’s job, with the Portuguese a free agent following his dismissal from Fenerbahce last month. A winner of league titles in Portugal, Greece and China, the 53-year-old is reported to have previously rejected overtures from the Goodison Park hierarchy back in 2019 while managing Shanghai.",Sport/Football,Football transfer rumours: Dele Alli and Yves Bissouma to Newcastle?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/24/football-transfer-rumours-dele-alli-and-yves-bissouma-to-newcastle
1/24/2022,"Awriter does not need to smile – on the page, words can do the smiling. This is something you are aware of throughout American playwright Sarah Ruhl’s extraordinary tale of being struck with Bell’s palsy a day after giving birth to twins. The first sign something is awry is when a lactation consultant casually observes that one of her eyes looks droopy. And when she gets up to look at herself in the bathroom mirror, she finds that the left side of her face has “fallen down. Eyebrow, fallen; eyelid, fallen; lip, fallen, frozen, immovable.” The smile she has, all her life, taken for granted is gone. She explains that, before seeing her reflection in the mirror, she was one person. Now she is another. But she is not self-pitying. Her prose is smart, quipping, pacy. It has the quicksilver mobility her face lacks.  She was unlucky: for many people, Bell’s palsy passes quickly. Hers proved depressingly tenacious. Ruhl describes a decade of paralysis but begins with her pregnancy (her second – she has a daughter at pre-school). Her account brought back memories (having had twins myself) of an in-body experience that at times seems almost an out-of-body experience, a physical overachievement that doubles as a hitch, a risk, an extravagant burden. She writes vividly about the marathon of early days after birth: “The sleep deprivation when breastfeeding twins can feel like a form of psychosis”, yet she does not neglect to celebrate her children, their joyous existence. Charmingly named after the intersection where she and her husband Tony (a child psychiatrist) met in Providence, Rhode Island - “Williams Street and Hope Street” - their twins are called William and Hope. But it is the Bell’s palsy that fascinates most. Ruhl’s face fell just at the point her career was doing the opposite: she had a play transferring to Broadway and had been nominated for a Tony. Disconcerting, you might concede, not to be able to smile on the red carpet. And yet you might also feel (Ruhl tries to tell herself this) that her paralysis is, after all, not life-threatening – a small affliction in the general scheme of things. That misgiving does not last: Ruhl’s achievement is in making one see how many questions her condition raises about how we – women in particular – interact with the world and try to appease it with a smile. “Women have been told by men to smile from time immemorial,” she writes. She is oppressed by the smile’s place in American (and worldwide) culture, resisting “horrid gleaming white teeth, gloating symmetries”. Above all, she shows how the absence of a smile meddles with the sense of self. Fortunately, she has always been more comfortable observing than being observed (as befits a playwright) and remarks that by maintaining a demure stillness, she has been partly able to disguise her problem. But there is a terrible (and obvious) downside to acting in a withdrawn manner: it makes her withdrawn. Ruhl uses the Bell’s palsy narrative as a cradle within which to rock other subjects, from her postpartum depression to “bed rest” as a historically male-imposed and often undesirable prescription for women, to a moving portrait of her courageous Australian mother-in-law, Elizabeth, who died of cancer a year after the babies were born. And she recounts her meetings with varied medics (some helpful, some shockingly out of order) in search of a cure. At no point does this seem a vanity project. It is, more often, a practical investigation that explores how, when half your face goes on strike, new ways have to be found to do a smile’s work. As the book progresses, Ruhl’s chin-up narrative becomes more distressing as one understands more of what has been involved in staying upbeat. Sometimes, she opts to explain the palsy to people she has not met before. At other times, she relies more on positive sound effects: offering approving murmurs to the students she teaches at Yale’s drama school. And throughout, she is driven by a contradictory purpose: to make peace with her face and to fight on to the point where the left side is able to embark on its uncertain upwards trajectory into a smile.

1/24/2022,"The movement of troops round the Ukrainian border now clearly heralds a crisis. Russia’s level of provocation is grotesque, but nothing on the ground poses any strategic threat to Britain or any other western government, or even to Europe’s security as a whole. Ukraine’s relations with Russia have been fraught since the toppling of the pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych in a coup in 2014. The country is split. When Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine rebelled, it was aided by Russia. Moscow seized Crimea. The longstanding ties with Russia were one reason why Nato left Ukraine out of its reckless post-Soviet rush to advance its security boundary as near as it could to the Russian border during the 1990s.  All evidence suggests that Vladimir Putin wants a regime in Kyiv favourable to Russian interests, much as Soviet leaders wanted in Hungary in 1956 and in Czechoslovakia in 1968. The west wisely did not argue or intervene on either of those occasions. Russia’s motives today seem much the same. Putin is determined to oppose the emergence of possible liberal, western-oriented societies in Belarus and Ukraine. He watched the other states in eastern Europe crumble and defect from the Warsaw Pact in 1990. He does not want to be the Russian leader who lost these two great territories to his immediate west. The concept of spheres of interest, regions where the interests of one nation are more important than the interests of another, has always been controversial in diplomacy. There is no UN doctrine of such spheres, but they are potent and all too real. They are relics of ancient empires and modern paranoias. The US regarded Moscow’s placing of missiles in Cuba in 1962, and support for Central American states as an intolerable threat. Likewise, Moscow is not prepared to tolerate US missiles in Ukraine or US troops rolling in to support an anti-Russian regime in Kyiv. Strategists of spheres of influence are left with the facts of geography and of crude balances of power. China has clearly been extending its reach into south-east Asia and the South China Sea. The US can object, but it is hard to see what gains are achieved by the current buildup of military machismo in the western Pacific, including Britain’s ludicrous decision to deploy an aircraft carrier in the South China Sea. The reality is that the west took a calculated gamble in expanding Nato in the 1990s. There was no suggestion of imitating Finland’s careful and pragmatic neutrality towards its Baltic neighbours that lie in Russia’s sphere of influence. Nato had post-Soviet Russia on the floor and simply could not resist the opportunity of kicking the country when it was already down. The way Nato treated Russia almost guaranteed there would be a chauvinist reflex. Moscow’s initial feelers from Boris Yeltsin that it might associate with Nato were rebuffed. Mooted associations with the EU were ridiculed. Everything was done to rub Russia’s nose in its shame. Putin and his present antics were the predictable result. The Russian president has now indicated that he wants the 2015 Minsk II settlement implemented. That settlement is sound. It requires autonomy for Russian-speaking Donbas, an end to Nato expansionism, Russian withdrawal and a reinstatement of Ukraine’s border. Samantha Power, US ambassador to the United Nations at the time of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, remarked that Minsk was the “only viable way out of this deadly conflict”. Subsequent US administrations have supported that position. Yet no one has applied sufficient diplomatic effort to put it in place. Any reasonable observer would see Minsk as a practical and fair way out of this crisis. It has largely been blocked by a Kyiv regime that has long feared Donbas’s pro-Russian sentiment and resisted its “home rule”. Recognise the autonomy of the Donbas region, Putin says, and he will withdraw. He cannot want to keep 100,000 troops mobilised on the Donbas border indefinitely, any more than he can seriously fear a western army storming east across Ukraine. At that point, the realpolitik of power comes on stage. It is inconceivable that Nato, in the shape of the US and Britain, would confront Russian battle lines in Donbas. Germany and France would have no part in it. Nor do the US and Britain have the necessary troops. They have the threat of missile barrages, but without logistical support these merely sow destruction. Moreover, Britain has no obligation to defend Ukraine. Nor does it have an obligation to deter or confront what appears to be an imminent Russian attack. The country has no alliance with Ukraine. Ukraine is not a member of Nato. And Britain has no significant means of influencing the outcome of a battle on the ground. For these reasons, it should stay well out of the situation. Putin’s current show of strength is that of a thin-skinned dictator flexing before his people and the world such muscle as he can still muster. If he goes ahead and invades Donbas, the world will descend on his head with massive damnation, as well as savage but pointless economic sanctions. We saw that over Crimea. The root of peace in these crises lies in strength, strength to keep everything in proportion and to see a way through. The risk is always that curse of history: when hostilities turn to crisis, war can seem the simplest, most glorious way forward.

1/24/2022,"A groundbreaking scheme overseen by UNHCR to process women’s asylum claims in the community rather than by locking up the applicants in detention has led to only one being granted leave to remain in the UK, according to a report. The aim of the pilot scheme was not to boost granted rates of asylum claims but to demonstrate that the asylum process could be successfully managed in the community without the need to lock women up, something the United Nations refugee agency said it had succeeded in doing in the report published on Monday.  However, participants hoped that the support and access to legal advice the project offered would help them secure the right to remain in the UK. The sample size of the pilot was small, with initial plans to recruit 50 women reduced to just 20 taking part in the two-year experiment, due to the pandemic. The women involved had all had initial asylum claims refused and had it not been for the pilot scheme would have found themselves detained in Home Office detention centres. They received accommodation, £38 a week, access to legal advice and support from Action Foundation, a refugee charity that worked with the Home Office to administer the pilot scheme. UNHCR was involved in discussions about the design of the scheme and oversaw its monitoring and evaluation. At the end of the scheme four women agreed to return voluntarily to their home countries, eight were told there were no options for them to remain in the UK, five left the pilot before their asylum claims were resolved and two left the pilot without informing Action Foundation. Just weeks before the publication of the evaluation of the pilot scheme into alternatives to detaining women the Home Office started to detain women at a new women-only immigration detention centre – Derwentside in County Durham. It is the first new women’s detention centre since Yarl’s Wood in Bedfordshire was opened two decades ago. The Guardian has received reports that so far only a handful of women have been detained there. The numbers of men and women detained has declined sharply in recent years but human rights campaigners fear the Home Office is going to start increasing the numbers locked up. In the evaluation report Home Office officials said that, along with the newly opened Derwentside, the department will continue to maintain spaces at three other detention centres, including Yarl’s Wood, to hold female detainees, ensuring that the Home Office has “the geographical footprint and resilience to meet future need”. Women for Refugee Women, which advocates for women in immigration detention, has started legal action against the Home Office over Derwentside about its compliance with equality laws. Gemma Lousley, policy and research coordinator at Women for Refugee Women, said: “We urge the Home Office to build on the alternative to detention scheme evaluated by this report by ending the use of detention for women immediately and resolving their cases in the community instead.” The evaluation report, which UNHCR commissioned from NatCen, found that the women involved experienced more stability and better health and wellbeing outcomes as a result of being in the community rather than in detention centres and that there was no decrease in compliance with the immigration system. However, there was a misapprehension among the women that joining the pilot scheme would boost their chances of getting a positive decision on their asylum claim. UNHCR urged the Home Office to only use detention as a measure of last resort and to strengthen alternatives to detention. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The public rightly expects us to remove those who have abused our hospitality and do not have the right to be here. Immigration detention is essential to enable this. Derwentside IRC will accommodate those who have been to found to have no right to remain in the UK and foreign national offenders while we prepare to remove them.”",News/UK news,Scheme not to detain women seeking asylum leads to only one staying in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/24/scheme-not-to-detain-women-seeking-asylum-leads-to-only-one-staying-in-uk
1/24/2022,"Former Conservative Cabinet minister David Davis has called for the planned tax rise hitting national insurance contributions to be scrapped as a cost-of-living crisis looms, adding further pressure on the government. National insurance contributions, which are paid by employers and workers, are scheduled to rise by 1.25 percentage points at the start of the new tax year in April, in a manifesto-breaking move to raise £12bn to increase NHS funding by Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson.  However, the Conservative leadership is under intense pressure as it awaits the findings of an investigation into parties held at 10 Downing Street during national lockdowns, as well as the new allegations of Islamophobia levelled against the party by the former transport minister Nusrat Ghani. Davis, who last week called in parliament for Johnson to resign, said the government should not follow through on the tax increase because of the financial pressure already facing households amid inflationary cost increases and the imminent increase in the energy price cap. “It was a judgment made on, frankly, quite a lot of wrong data,” Davis said, speaking on Monday on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “They didn’t know at the time that by April we would have the highest inflation rate in 30 years, they didn’t know that interest rates would be going up, council tax would be going up, the fuel price is about to jump by £700 a year for the average family. Therefore they didn’t know quite what pressure there would be on ordinary people.” Davis last week told Johnson that he should “in the name of God, go” because of the allegations about his attendance at parties – a reference to words said to Neville Chamberlain after a series of failures at the start of the second world war. However, Davis’s comments on Monday reflected a more typical unease among Tory MPs for raising taxes. Davis argued that the tax increase might have a negative effect on growth and public finances if it diminished demand – but also acknowledged that cancelling the increase would be in “our own political interests as well as the national interest”. Sunak has reportedly tried to distance himself from the tax increase, with the Mail on Sunday reporting that the chancellor referred to the national insurance rise as “the prime minister’s tax”. The Treasury, under the chancellor, has direct oversight of all tax increases. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the report suggested a “whole new definition of tax dodging” while criticising her counterpart on Twitter. “The entire cabinet would get behind stopping the planned national insurance rise,” she wrote. “But the chancellor and the prime minister remain adamant about their plan to heap the biggest tax burden in 70 years on working people.”",Lifestyle/Money,"Scrap national insurance rise, says ex-minister David Davis",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/24/national-insurance-david-davis-boris-johnson-covid
