3/12/2022,"If you are an average investor, a cheaper stock price for Amazon (AMZN) could be just the moment you need to get into a growth company with major potential catalysts, analysts say. This week Amazon revealed a 20-for-1 stock split announcement. The company also uncorked a massive $10 billion stock buyback plan. Amazon's stock split is the fourth one in its history. The last split came in September 1999. If shareholders approve of the split, it will begin trading on the new basis on June 6. ""The stock split is important. It increases the accessibility to a broader array of investors and it does allow for inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). Academically, does it change the stock price? No, but it makes it more accessible and if you are included in the Dow index-based funds will have to own you. That creates demand for shares,"" said Wells Fargo tech analyst Brian Fitzgerald on Yahoo Finance Live. Shares of the e-commerce giant gained 5% on Thursday as traders cheered Amazon's stock split and new buyback. The stock tacked on another 1% in Friday's session. The stock has been among the top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance platform the past 24-hours. Fitzgerald adds investors shouldn't overlook Amazon's buyback announcement either as it sends important clues on future profits. ""We think that the buyback is just further evidence of a sharper focus on profitability. Amazon undertook a significant investment cycle over the last two years to support the rapid expansion that happened during COVID. We believe that the investment intensity is downshifting to a more single digit basis,"" Fitzgerald said. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

3/12/2022,"Money can’t buy happiness directly, but it seems like paying a financial advisor sure can help. A new survey found people with more than $1.2 million in household assets report higher levels of happiness when working with a financial advisor compared to those who don’t have an advisor. The finding is part of Herbers & Company’s inaugural Consumer Financial Behaviors Study, which polled 1,000 consumers across the U.S. A financial advisor can help you manage assets and plan for retirement. Find a trusted advisor today. “As individuals move past $1.2 million of assets, those who work with financial advisors rapidly increase in happiness, while those without advisors rapidly become less happy,” wrote Sonya Lutter, the certified financial planner (CFP) and licensed therapist who authored the study. Herbers & Company is a consultancy firm that specializes in helping independent financial advisory firms grow their businesses. To quantify a respondent’s level of happiness, the survey presented each consumer with a list of 43 questions concerning his or her daily behaviors and interactions. The survey also pinpointed four core principles of happiness – fulfillment, intention, impact and gratefulness – and gauged how much respondents identify with each. All participants in the survey have at least $250,000 in household assets. The survey found that 66% of respondents who work with a financial advisor reported heightened levels of all four core factors of happiness. Only 34% of people without an advisor identified with those four principles in the same way. The results of the study also suggest that those with financial advisors experience greater satisfaction outside of their relationship with money. “People who have financial advisors are not only happier with their finances, but they are also far happier about their personal relationships and their communication with their partners,” wrote Lutter, a former administrator of applied human sciences at Kansas State University. “While it’s possible that happy couples might be more likely to hire financial advisors, it’s also possible that working with a financial advisor gives couples an opportunity to talk about financial goals, and thereby gives them a happiness boost.” Then again, the more money a person has, the happier they'll be, right? Not exactly. Respondents with $1.2 million in household assets reported the same level of happiness, whether they work with a financial advisor or not. Those above that threshold who work with an advisor reported significantly higher levels of happiness than those without advisors. The largest disparity in happiness was observed among the richest respondents to the survey. Of high-net worth individuals with $6 million or more in assets, those with a financial advisor reported the highest levels of happiness across the study. Meanwhile, those without a financial advisor reported the highest levels of unhappiness in the study, despite owning $6 million or more in assets. “For those who make it to the top 5% of wealth in the U.S., working with an advisor can mean the difference between being happy with financial success or allowing money to decrease happiness,” Lutter wrote. “It appears that a financial advisor is needed to increase happiness levels above the $1.2 million threshold.” The old axiom is true, money can’t buy happiness. Then again, a recent Herbers & Co. survey found that people with the most money are happiest when working with a financial advisor. However, those with over $6 million in household assets but no advisor reported the highest levels of unhappiness in the study. The survey shows happiness levels fluctuate among people with fewer household assets, regardless of working with an advisor or not. But once individuals surpass the $1.2 million mark, those who work with a financial advisor report much higher levels of happiness than those who go it alone. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors in your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now. When looking to hire a financial advisor, it’s important to do your due diligence and interview at least three possible candidates. Ask about their account minimums, fee structures, investing philosophies and any special certifications they hold, like the CFP designation. You’ll want to take all of these factors into account when choosing an advisor. If you want to take a closer look at an advisor and/or their firm, search for them on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure database. This tool allows members of the public to access an advisor’s Form ADV, which contains important information about their business and displays any legal or regulatory disclosures on their record.

3/12/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- A Morgan Stanley trader is leaving the firm after racking up tens of millions of dollars in losses as a bout of market turmoil makes and breaks trading books across Wall Street. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: Kuleba Says Russian Talks Fruitless So Far Russia Devises Plan to Seize Firms Abandoned in Foreigner Exodus Ukraine Update: Russia Targeting Airfields in Western Ukraine Russia Bans Export of 200 Products After Suffering Sanctions Hit Tech Walls Off Russia Like Never Before, Posing New Risks for U.S. Hamza El Hassani, who traded dividends in the New York-based bank’s equities division, will be departing after transactions he oversaw went awry, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The losses tied to him were less than $50 million, one of the people said. El Hassani didn’t respond to a message seeking comment, and a representative for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has rocked global markets and spiraled across asset classes, catching some traders off guard and testing their hedges. An onslaught of international sanctions has severed correlations between a number of products that normally move in sync, derailing bets that were otherwise seen as safe. Heavy losses aren’t unusual in such trading conditions and they don’t always prompt separations from firms. Trading dividends is a niche of Wall Street financial engineering that lets investors bet on the dividend flows from a basket of shares or even single companies. Market uncertainty in recent weeks has hit dividend books across the street, opening up those trading desks to unexpected losses, one person said. The bank’s equity-derivatives unit sits within its equities business that also deals in common stocks and provides services to hedge funds. At Morgan Stanley, that business is normally seen as a market leader but fell behind Goldman Sachs Sachs Group Inc. in the final tally last year due to losses tied to Bill Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management. El Hassani had been with Morgan Stanley since 2017, according to brokerage industry records. He previously worked at Deutsche Bank AG and Societe Generale SA. Morgan Stanley is separately facing heightened public attention in another area of its operations: its handling of large stock transactions known as block trades. The bank acknowledged in a regulatory filing late last month that U.S. authorities are investigating various aspects of that business. It hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing.

3/12/2022,"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) is trading higher by 5% in Thursday’s pre-market after announcing a 20-for-1 stock split, effective on June 6th. The retail juggernaut also increased buyback share authorization by $5 billion, doubling the current $5 billion program, even though it’s repurchased just $2.12 billion of those shares so far. The stock rallied above the psychological 3,000 level after the news but drifted lower overnight, failing to mount a single resistance level. The announcement raises two questions about an otherwise bullish decision. First, the House Judiciary Committee referred Amazon to the Department of Justice earlier in the day to examine potential criminal conduct by “senior executives”. The referral alleges the company engaged in a “pattern and practice of misleading conduct that appeared designed to influence, obstruct, or impede the Committee’s 16-month investigation into competition in digital markets”. There’s little doubt that CEO Jeff Bezos will be a prime target in this investigation. Second, why did Amazon pick this moment to announce a split when investors have been begging for cheaper shares for years? For starters, the company has been pummeled by inflation and Ukraine so far in 2022, dropping to a 20-month low on Wednesday, and executives may feel a split is the only way to prop up price. It’s also sleight of hand because it adds nothing to valuation, especially in a fintech-driven market in which small investors can buy exposure by the dollar, not share. Wall Street consensus remains euphoric despite more than a year of sub-par performance, yielding a ‘Buy’ rating based upon 42 ‘Buy’, 7 ‘Overweight’, and 3 ‘Hold’ recommendations. Price targets currently range from a low of $3,472 to a Street-high $5,000 while the stock is set to open Thursday’s session more than $500 below the low target. This dismal placement signals a major disconnect with skeptical Main Street investors, who see a wall of headwinds dead ahead for the retailer. Amazon broke out above 2018 resistance above 2,000 in April 2020 and entered a powerful uptrend that stalled at 3,550 in September 2020. Five breakout attempts failed into November 2021, ahead of a major decline that fractured range support near 3,200 in January 2022. It tested new resistance and sold off in February, adding to losses that have now relinquished 23% of the stock’s value. Long-term support around 2,500 still hasn’t come into play but bearish momentum is likely to pick up when split enthusiasts run out of buying power.

3/12/2022,"Russia is facing effective bankruptcy as soon as Wednesday after the World Bank warned that crippling sanctions have left the Kremlin “mighty close” to a default on its foreign debts. Carmen Reinhart, chief economist at the World Bank, said that Russia and Belarus are now in “square default territory”, with payments on about $40bn of Moscow’s external bonds at risk. Analysts fear the country will fail to make a $117m (£89m) coupon payment on a sovereign eurobond next week. It will have a 30-day grace period to pay up, but may be deemed to have defaulted if it attempts to pay in roubles. Foreign investors hold about half of Russia’s currency-linked bonds, leaving banks that bought debt from Moscow potentially exposed to multi-billion-dollar losses as a result. France is most at risk, with $4.5bn of Russian government bonds held by the country's lenders. It came as Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said that Russia is facing a ""deep recession"" from sanctions which have cut access to its central bank reserves, reduced living standards and sparked an exodus of Western businesses. A large-scale default would be Russia’s first since the aftermath of the Bolshevik revolution in 1917. The ratings agency Fitch has cut Russia’s sovereign debt rating to “C”, deep in junk territory, warning a default is “imminent” as Moscow is increasingly frozen out of the global financial system. Ms Reinhart said: “They're not rated by the agencies as a selective default yet, but mighty close."" Althea Spinozzi, a fixed rates strategist at Saxo Bank, said Russia might default “as soon as next week”. Defaulting would mean Moscow is ostracised on global debt markets, leaving it unable to tap Western investors for money. But president Vladimir Putin’s ""Fortress Russia"" strategy may leave the nation resilient to this, and sanctions rule out such borrowing in the near term in any case. The fate of tens of billions more in corporate debt is also at stake. Alastair George, chief investment strategist at investment research firm Edison Group, said it was difficult to gauge the Kremlin’s “end game”. He added: “The typical stick that bondholders would use is to say: ‘Okay, if you default on this debt, you'll trash your reputation, and you won't be able to raise capital on international financial markets'. “But Russia could turn around and say: ‘Well, we're not gonna be able to do that, anyway’.” Sanctions are expected to send the Russian economy into a steep contraction. The rouble has collapsed in value since the invasion and its stock market remains shut. Speaking to journalists on Thursday evening, Ms Georgieva, of the IMF, said: ""Unprecedented sanctions have led to abrupt contraction of the Russian economy, moving into a deep recession. ""We are mindful that massive currency depreciation is driving inflation up. It is denting severely the purchasing power and standard of living for a vast majority of the Russian population. She added that global growth forecasts are likely to be cut next month as a result of the crisis. Read the latest on the Russia-Ukraine conflict in our live blog Russian foreign minister Anton Siluanov said on Thursday that Russia would make debt payments to “unfriendly” nations – including the UK, US, Japan and EU – in roubles, even though they are due in dollars, in line with orders from Mr Putin. The payments would only be converted to foreign currency if the West ends a freeze on the Kremlin’s $640bn foreign exchange warchest, Mr Siluanov said. Rouble payment may prove unpalatable to western investors, who typically expect to be compensated in the same currency they used to buy the bonds, and could constitute a default. Trading on credit-default swaps (CDS), which pay out on an event of default, implies a 71pc chance of a Russian default within the next 12 months, and 81pc in the next five years. The Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee, which makes decisions on CDS rules, has held a series of crisis meetings to determine whether repayment in roubles would represent a failure to meet currency rules. It will meet again on Friday as officials struggle to reach a decision. Patrick Ghali, co-founder of hedge fund advisory firm Sussex Partners, said that trying to capitalise on the “messy” situation was difficult. ""As the dust settles, I'm sure that there are going to be some people that are going to make money. There are going to be some opportunities to get something very, very cheap,"" he said.",World/The Telegraph•2 days ago,Russia at risk of default within days,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russia-risk-default-within-days-111141632.html
