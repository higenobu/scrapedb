2/27/2022,"South-east Queensland has faced several days of intense rain, with flooding expected to continue and move into northern New South Wales on Sunday. Here’s a summary of events so far: Six people have died in Queensland. A 37-year-old Brisbane man died on Sunday morning in Indooroopilly after his car was submerged in floodwaters. It was the second death in Brisbane after a man was killed in Stones Corner on Friday night. There have been two deaths in Gympie, one in the Sunshine Coast hinterland, and an SES worker who died while trying to rescue a family at Coolana, west of Ipswich. A 54-year-old man also died in flood waters on the NSW central coast on Friday night, taking the total toll to seven. Gympie has recorded its highest flood in a century. The Mary River had hit 22.91 metres by Sunday morning, exceeding the 1999 floods (21.95 metres), as well as subsequent floods in 2011 and 2013, and the highest level recorded since 1898. Hundreds of people were evacuated from the town on Saturday afternoon with water levels expected to continue to rise on Sunday. Thousands of homeowners are on alert in Brisbane. On Saturday night, the Brisbane lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, warned that council modelling forecast thousands of Brisbane properties in dozens of suburbs were at risk of flooding on Sunday morning. High tide was expected at 7.30am on Sunday (8.30am AEDT). Ipswich residents in low-lying areas were also warned to evacuate. Flood warnings were current for many Queensland rivers on Sunday morning. This included major warnings for the Mary, Logan, Bremer, Mooloolah, Noosa and Maroochy rivers, and Warrill and Coochin creeks. Northern NSW is also facing flood warnings on Sunday, with six-hour rainfalls of 250mm possible. With the weather system tracking south, there were warnings in place for flooding at locations including Lismore, Grafton, Coffs Harbour, Tenterfield, Murwillumbah, Yamba, Maclean, Woolgoolga, Sawtell and Dorrigo. More than 300mm of rain were recorded in areas on Saturday. Beerburrum on the Sunshine Coast recorded 321mm in the 24 hours to 9am Sunday, Brisbane recorded 214mm, Gympie 206mm, and Redcliffe 253mm. Hundreds of roads are closed, including major highways. Queensland’s transport minister, Mark Bailey, revealed on Saturday there were approximately 1000 roads closed across the region, including the Bruce Highway between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, and the Warrego Highway between Brisbane and Toowoomba. Train services between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast were also not running. Disaster assistance has been activated for 10 Queensland councils. The funds will go to clean-up efforts in the Fraser Coast, Gold Coast, Gympie, Ipswich, Lockyer Valley, Logan, Noosa, North Burnett, Sunshine Coast and Toowoomba LGAs, and will be jointly funded by the federal and state governments. Late on Saturday, the Insurance Council of Australia declared an insurance catastrophe. Water was being released from Brisbane’s Wivenhoe Dam on Sunday morning. While the dam had reached 100% of its drinking water capacity, there was still 2m megalitres of flood capacity, according to Seqwater. In 2011, releases from Wivenhoe contributed to flooding in Brisbane and Ipswich. Flood releases were also occurring from Somerset and North Pine dams, while 20 ungated dams were overflowing on Sunday morning.",News/Australia news,South-east Queensland floods: what’s happened and which areas could be hit next?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/27/south-east-queensland-floods-whats-happened-and-which-areas-could-be-hit-next
2/27/2022,"Eddie Jones insisted England were due the rub of the green from the referee in their narrow win over Wales amid frustrations from their opponents that Alex Dombrandt’s crucial try stood. The Wales head coach, Wayne Pivac, was aggrieved England’s solitary try was allowed to stand but Jones expressed little sympathy, highlighting perceived injustices in Cardiff last year. England kept their Six Nations title hopes alive with a 23-19 victory but had led 17-0, only for Wales to come roaring back with tries from Josh Adams, Nick Tompkins and Kieran Hardy. England managed only one try through Dombrandt but Pivac claimed Adam Beard was illegally impeded by Maro Itoje at the lineout in the buildup. Beard appeared unable to get up to compete for Ryan Elias’s throw as the ball sailed over both sets of lineout forwards and into Dombrandt’s welcoming arms. Asked about the incident, however, Jones pointed to last year’s 40-24 defeat at the Principality Stadium in which Adams and Liam Williams scored controversial tries – the first from a cross-field kick from Dan Biggar when England were not defensively set, the second after what appeared to be an obvious knock-on from Louis Rees-Zammit. “I don’t comment on the referee,” insisted Jones. “We take the good with the bad. We took 14 points last year in a Six Nations game where they allowed a play where the ball wasn’t alive and then a blatant knock-on. There’s the rub of the green here, sometimes you get it and sometimes you don’t. So if we got it today, that’s well and good, we’re not going to complain about it, just as we didn’t complain last year when we didn’t get the rub of the green.” Pivac, however, believes the referee, Mike Adamson of Scotland, should have reviewed the lineout in question and that if he had, Dombrandt’s try would not have been awarded. “Adam Beard was pushed out, he was chased out of the lineout and bumped,” said Pivac. “Unfortunately that wasn’t picked up and the try stands. Certainly from the replay we’ve seen there was an offence there, we think anyway. I’m disappointed with [it]. If we had an opportunity to review that try, it probably wouldn’t have been given.” England’s victory means they will welcome Ireland to Twickenham after the championship’s second fallow week still in the hunt for top spot. Luke Cowan-Dickie is expected to be unavailable after limping off with a serious-looking knee injury but Jones was hopeful Tom Curry, who went off at half-time because of a head injury, will be available. The manner of France’s comprehensive victory over Scotland earlier in the day compared with England’s jittery finish, however, suggests there are significant improvements to be made if Jones’s side are to be considered serious contenders. “It was a very good win for us,” Jones said. “There was plenty of resilience, plenty of toughness. We got ourselves in a lot of good attacking positions and we’re able to convert that to points. But for a young team we need to find a way to be more ruthless once we get in the opposition’s 22.” Ben Youngs became England’s most capped men’s player of all-time when he came off the bench after 61 minutes, eclipsing Jason Leonard’s previous record of 114. Leonard was in the stands to see his record broken but Youngs said the celebratory drink with the former prop would have to wait. “Oh God, not yet, I want to be able to play in two weeks’ time. Today highlighted what an incredible player he was as well – to get 114 as a prop. I look forward to having a beer with Jason next time I see him, he kindly messaged me today and I look forward to that very much. [The reception] was incredible, I am very thankful for the rugby community and how they have responded this week and the support I have been given.”",Sport/Sport,‘I don’t comment on the referee’: Jones rejects Wales complaint over try,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/26/i-dont-comment-on-the-referee-jones-rejects-wales-complaint-over-try
2/27/2022,"Marcelo Bielsa is set to leave Leeds after Saturday’s 4-0 home defeat by Tottenham, with the club close to appointing the former RB Leipzig manager Jesse Marsch as his replacement. Lawyers are in talks over the departure of Bielsa, who has overseen a run of four straight Premier League defeats in which Leeds have conceded 17 goals. The club are firmly in a relegation battle, two points ahead of third-bottom Burnley having played two games more. Marsch, a former United States midfielder, left Leipzig by mutual consent last December five months after taking charge. He was previously at Red Bull Salzburg, where he won two Austrian league titles and two domestic cups. Bielsa earned hero status at Leeds by taking the club into the Premier League as champions in 2020, after 16 years away, with an attractive brand of football and enhanced that with a ninth-placed finish last season. But this campaign has been markedly less successful, hampered by injuries to key players such as Patrick Bamford and Kalvin Phillips. Bielsa, appointed in June 2018, has stuck unwaveringly with the philosophy that has defined his coaching but has been unable to spark an upturn and the team have been worryingly open. The four goals conceded against Tottenham followed six being let in at Liverpool. It had been widely expected that a parting of ways would come in the summer but that process is being accelerated. The Argentinian had said before the Spurs game that he was “very worried” by results and acknowledged the shortcomings after the match. “No team that goes through the results we have has confidence in the coach,” he said. “I feel backed up by the team in the effort they are giving me. We had a distinctive style, with speed in transitions, and we could defend as a unit. Not now. When we lose the ball we are making it easy for our opponents.” Marsch started his managerial career with Montreal Impact in 2011 and had a spell at New York Red Bulls before coming to Europe. After working as Ralf Rangnick’s assistant at Leipzig he moved within the Red Bull stable to Salzburg before returning to Leipzig to succeed Julian Nagelsmann. His short tenure ended with the club 11th in the Bundesliga and out of the Champions League.",Sport/Football,Marcelo Bielsa set to leave Leeds with Jesse Marsch in line to replace him,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/26/marcelo-bielsa-to-leave-leeds-jesse-marsch
2/27/2022,"In the end, Ben Youngs’s big moment got a little lost in all the excitement. The match was an hour old, and just beginning to slip from England’s grip, when he finally came on for his 115th cap and beat the record set by Jason Leonard back in 2004. England had been 17-0 up not so very long ago, but Wales, who, for all their flaws, absolutely did not stop coming, had scored two tries, and 12 points, in the last seven minutes. Twickenham was rocking, and England were reeling. The crowd cheered as he walked onto the field, but the sound was quickly swallowed up in the hubbub as England launched their restart downfield. His teammates had other things on their minds, too. They had only just broken from a huddle under the posts, where they’d been busy plotting the way back into the match, you wondered, in that moment, if they were going to blow it. England have failed in these moments before, they did it at Murrayfield against Scotland just three weeks back, but this time, they clawed their way back into the match, and closed it out. You would think Youngs has just about seen it all in the 12 years he’s been playing Test rugby, but this situation must have felt a little unfamiliar all the same. He’s usually the one coming off the pitch at this point, not coming on. He did it against Italy in the last round of matches,when England were winning at a canter, but the last time before that was two years previously, when Jones started Willi Heinz in a Calcutta Cup match in Edinburgh. Youngs took it in his stride. And the change worked. He provided a cool head, steady hand, and sure boot, as England worked their way back downfield and chiselled out a couple of penalties. “Ben has matured into a great team man,” said Eddie Jones afterwards, “there’s no better team man than him, he always wants to be starting but he’s accepted for this game his role was as a finisher.” England are lucky to have him, Jones said, “his kicking, his organisation, his communication, were first class”. Youngs may have to get used to the new role. Harry Randall played well in the hour he had. It’s always foolish business trying to second guess Jones’ thinking, he will surely want to stick with his burgeoning partnership between Randall and Marcus Smith. Randall, like every rugby-loving kid, must have dreamed of playing in these games back when he was young. We will maybe have to wait till he’s retired before we get a straight answer about which colour shirt he imagined he would be wearing. He was born in Slough, and has English parents, but the family moved to Wales when he was four, and he grew up playing for Llandovery College, and then the Scarlets. He was the captain of Wales Under-16s, and even turned in a man-of-the-match display for them when they beat England in 2013. He switched to the England Under-18s after he moved back to study at Hartpury two years later. Randall’s old coach at Llandovery, Iestyn Thomas, says that at the Scarlets they thought he was too small, and his pass was too slow, to make a go of it in the professional game. Thomas was so incensed that he jury-rigged a speedometer to prove them wrong. If Randall’s pass really was lacking back then, it’s sharp enough now. It is startlingly quick compared to Youngs’ slow and deliberate delivery. In fact, there were a couple of occasions when Smith had to snatch twice at the ball because it came at him with so much pace on it. Randall brings a little urgency to it all, he hurry-scrurries from ruck to ruck and snaps the ball this way and that, pop, pop, pop, to the forwards lumbering up outside him. He has quick hands and quick feet too. He made one break when he sold Nick Tompkins a dummy and stepped inside Tomos Williams, and almost scored himself when he came scuttling in after Kyle Sinckler and took a quick skip through a little sliver of a gap in the Welsh defence. He put Max Malins through with a cute chip too, that sent the ball tumbling end-over-end into the 22, where Liam Williams gathered it and was bundled into touch. He and Smith made plenty of chances, but England weren’t ruthless enough to take them. They let too many chances go begging, which is what made the second-half of the game so nerve-shredding. That wasn’t Randall’s fault. But Jones was right to take him off when he did. Wales scored again in the 80th minute, and it was good to have Youngs there for those excruciatingly tense final moments, as Wales tried to find a route back to the try-line. In the end, England won a turnover, and it was Youngs who was there right behind him, barking orders at the forwards. He waited till everything settled, then scooped the ball up and belted it out sideways into touch.",Sport/Sport,Youngs breaks Leonard’s record but keeps barking out instructions | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/26/youngs-breaks-leonards-record-but-keeps-barking-out-instructions
