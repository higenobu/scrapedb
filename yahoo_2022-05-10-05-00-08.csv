Vicky White provided Casey White with extra food and privileges, police said. Last week, authorities issued an arrest warrant for Vicky White. Singleton said the former corrections officer ""participated"" in Casey White's escape. Surveillance footage released by authorities on May 3 showed Casey White, who was donning shackles and handcuffs, being escorted by Vicky White out of the Lauderdale County Detention Center and into her patrol vehicle. Singleton said Vicky White was escorting the inmate to a courthouse appointment that didn't actually exist. Casey White was serving a 75-year prison sentence for kidnapping and attempted murder charges when he escaped. While in custody, he also confessed to a 2015 killing. The U.S. Marshals Service is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the capture of Casey White and a $5,000 reward for the capture of Vicky White.
