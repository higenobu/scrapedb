1/6/2022,"Booming electric car sales were a bright spot in a tough car market last year amid disruption to global supply chains hitting manufacturers, according to fresh data. In its annual sales snapshot for 2021, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said carmakers sold 190,000 battery electric cars across the country last year, accounting for about 11.6% of total sales.  Reflecting growing appetite for greener vehicles, sales rose from 108,000 in 2020, when battery-powered cars accounted for just 6.6% of new cars bought in Britain. In December 2021 alone, electric cars made up 26% of sales, a record for a single month when physical dealerships were allowed to open during the Covid pandemic. Against a backdrop of global supply chain disruption and shortages of crucial semiconductor chips, overall UK car industry sales for the year were up just 1% from 2020 levels to 1.65m, and remained almost a third below total sales in 2019. However, sales of battery electric vehicles were a bright spot for the industry, the SMMT said, as Britons bought more electric cars in 2021 than in the previous five years combined. Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said thelack of microchips used in everything from windscreen wipers to in-car entertainment systems would continue to serve as a drag on the car industry during 2022. “[It] will undermine the market for the rest of the year,” he said. “We think demand is still there, demand is still strong,” Hawes told reporters. “The challenge is how to supply to customers.” Some manufacturers have managed to cope with the disruption better than others. Tesla was the standout electric performer, with its Model 3 becoming the first electric car to rank among the top 10 marques for overall sales. After reporting record deliveries this week, Tesla’s market value has surged in recent days to $1.2tn (£883bn) – more than the next 10 carmakers combined, according to data company Sentieo. The Model 3 was beaten to the UK top spot by Vauxhall’s Corsa, which also meant that Ford’s Fiesta lost its title as the bestseller for the first time in 12 years. Hawes said the rise of the electric car share meant that there was a “significant reduction” in the average emissions of cars sold in the UK for the second year in a row, following three years of rising emissions associated with bulky sports utility vehicles (SUVs). Although the industry lobby group has not yet completed analysis of the sales data, Hawes suggested it may be in the order of 10% or more. Reflecting the fallout from the pandemic, overall UK sales in 2020 and 2021 were the lowest since 1992. The industry is hoping for a recovery in the coming months given signs of elevated demand such as used cars costing more than newer models. Before the emergence of the Omicron variant, the SMMT forecast that car companies would recover to sell 1.96m cars in 2022. However, Hawes said the industry remained worried by signals from the UK government as ministers push for electric cars to go from one in every 100 on Britain’s roads to one in three by 2030, when sales of new cars with traditional internal combustion engines will be banned. He criticised two cuts to grants for electric cars during 2021, patchy investment in on-street chargers, and a delay on plans to force car parks to install a charger first revealed by the Guardian. “It’s a confusing message,” Hawes said. “If you’re going to achieve this it’s a massive ambition to get the entire market to move to net zero by 2030/2035, so you need to use every lever at your disposal and have a clear message to the consumer that this is the right thing to do and something that will work for the consumer. “Anything that brings into doubt that commitment doesn’t help the consumer that might be wavering.” Top 10 cars overall Vauxhall Corsa Tesla Model 3 Mini Mini Mercedes-Benz A-class Volkswagen Polo Volkswagen Golf Nissan Qashqai Ford Puma Kia Sportage Toyota Yaris Top 10 battery electric vehicles Tesla Model 3 Kia Niro Volkswagen ID3 Nissan Leaf Audi e-tron Hyundai Kona Mini Mini Renault Zoe Vauxhall Corsa MG ZS",News/Environment,Carmakers report booming UK sales of electric vehicles,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/06/uk-carmakers-report-booming-sales-of-electric-vehicles
1/6/2022,"Stronger safeguards are needed to protect the millions of UK shoppers who use “buy now, pay later” deals because many people do not realise they are taking on debt, a consumer body has warned. Buy now, pay later (BNPL) lets shoppers delay payment for an item with no interest or charges – unless you fail to pay it back on time, at which point some firms impose late fees.  The three main BNPL firms are Klarna, Clearpay and Laybuy, and this form of unregulated interest-free credit has enjoyed explosive growth during the coronavirus pandemic, particularly among the under-30s and those with tight finances. In response to concerns, the government announced last February that BNPL would be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, though the rules are unlikely to take effect until later this year or in 2023. A Treasury consultation, which closes on Thursday (6 January), will be followed by an FCA consultation. In the meantime, stronger safeguards – such as affordability checks and making small print more accessible – are needed now, according to the consumer organisation Which? It said many of the BNPL users it had interviewed did not think of these deals as a form of credit – instead, they described them as a “way to pay” or a “money management tool”. This meant they could unwittingly be exposing themselves to a range of potential problems if they failed to pay back on time, such as late fees, black marks on their credit report or having their case referred to a debt collector. Though BNPL is a form of credit, it works differently to more traditional methods of borrowing such as credit cards. For example, not all BNPL schemes run “hard” credit checks, whereby a full search of someone’s credit report is carried out. Rocio Concha, the director of policy and advocacy at Which?, said: “BNPL schemes can offer speed and convenience at the checkout, but our research shows that many users do not realise they are taking on debt or consider the prospect of missing payments.” The consumer body said that, “given the immediate risk,” BNPL firms should make their terms and conditions more accessible now. It added that affordability assessments should be carried out for all transactions before regulation is introduced.",Lifestyle/Money,"Buy now, pay later customers unaware of debt risks, warns Which?",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/06/buy-now-pay-later-customers-unaware-of-debt-risks-warns-which
1/6/2022,"Bedroom-pop singer, songwriter and producer PinkPantheress has topped the BBC’s annual Sound of … poll for hotly tipped new musical talent. The 20-year-old from Bath, who moved to London to study film, first built buzz on TikTok, where she now has 1.1m followers, uploading tracks that span UK garage, jungle and pop. Her tracks Pain and Just for Me – the latter was covered by Coldplay – broke into the UK Top 40 in 2020. Her debut full-length project, the mixtape To Hell With It, reached No 20.  “Music has been the same for so long. It’s like: please, can we get something else?” she told the Guardian in an October interview, explaining her genre-mixing approach. “I hope people start to feel more free to break the boundaries of what is acceptable, or the most sonically appealing to everyone.” Runners-up in the poll, voted on by a panel of dozens of industry figures and musicians including Billie Eilish and Ed Sheeran, are Isle of Wight indie duo Wet Leg, whose debut single Chaise Longue became a cult hit in 2020. Rounding out the Top 5 are emotive pop balladeer Mimi Webb, who reached the Top 10 with single Good Without; Lola Young, who broke through to a wider audience by appearing on John Lewis’s Christmas advert with a cover of Together in Electric Dreams, and Central Cee, the drill rapper whose stardom is already well established with two Top 10 hits and three nominations at this year’s Brit awards. Previous winners of the poll include Adele, Michael Kiwanuka and Sam Smith. Last year’s winner was Coventry rapper Pa Salieu; 2020 winner Celeste went on to have a No 1 album with her debut Not Your Muse.",Arts/Music,PinkPantheress tops stardom-predicting BBC Sound of … poll,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/06/pinkpantheress-tops-stardom-predicting-bbc-sound-of-poll
1/6/2022,"Antonio Conte acknowledged Chelsea were “much stronger” than Tottenham Hotspur after watching his side get outclassed at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night.  “There’s an important gap, an important difference, there’s a big job to do to retrieve the situation,” said Tottenham’s manager following Chelsea’s 2-0 Carabao Cup semi-final, first leg win. It was not the first return to his former club Conte would have desired in the wake of his sacking by Chelsea in 2018 but, after seeing his team sunk by Kai Havertz’s opener and a comedic Ben Davies own goal, the Italian was in no mood to sugar-coat Tottenham’s situation. Stressing the superiority of Thomas Tuchel’s side, he suggested there would be no quick fixes. “Last season Chelsea won the Champions League and this is enough to explain the difference between us and them,” said Conte who took charge of Spurs in November. “We need time, so much time, to retrieve the situation. You cannot do this in only six months or one year. They were much stronger than us. I do not see a solution in this transfer window. “It was a difficult game, difficult from the start, Chelsea were much better but we are talking about one of the best teams in Europe, in the world. If you compare the two teams there is not a comparison. “I know the situation, it is very clear in this moment there is an important gap. If we think we are close [to Chelsea] we are not in the right way.” Although Tuchel cautioned the tie is “not yet decided”, Chelsea’s manager looked suitably delighted at the end of an evening on which he recalled Romelu Lukaku. “It seems like a deserved win, an excellent result,” he said. “It reflects the game. We could have scored more but it is hard to score against Tottenham. We did create a lot, some huge chances. We never lost the focus, never lost the commitment; it was impressive. The team was very focused, very open-minded.” Tuchel, who revealed Havertz broke a finger in the first half, expressed satisfaction with Lukaku following the striker’s re-admittance to the first team fold in the wake of his apology following a well-documented, and controversial, Italian interview. Having, perhaps generously, described Lukaku’s often underwhelming display as “good”, Tuchel said he was “absolutely happy” with the Belgian. “Romelu can handle pressure and adversity. It was a good performance, he contributed a lot to our defensive set up and had chances. I liked how he played.”",Sport/Football,‘An important gap’: Conte admits Chelsea are much stronger than Spurs,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/05/antonio-conte-admits-there-is-no-comparison-between-chelsea-and-spurs
