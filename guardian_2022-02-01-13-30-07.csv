2/1/2022,"Aged care workers have described comments by the health minister, Greg Hunt, on Covid deaths in the sector as “astonishing” and “disrespectful”, and say the significance of those deaths is being downplayed by politicians. On Monday, Hunt addressed a growing number of deaths in aged care, with 473 Covid-related aged-care deaths recorded in January alone.  “The latest advice that I have is that approximately 60% of those that have agonisingly passed have been in palliative care,” Hunt said. He added: “… the definition is that they have passed with Covid, and they are absolutely rightly counted as a national loss. But approximately 60% of those that have passed were in palliative care.” The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation federal secretary, Annie Butler, said the comments were “astonishing”. “How much more disrespectful to elderly Australians can this government be,” Butler asked. “To turn around and say basically, ‘you were just going to die anyway,’ rather than acknowledging that they died faster and in difficult conditions because the government didn’t look after them well enough. “The comments are just outrageous because elderly people can be in palliative care for a week, for two weeks, or even years, and the aim is to make sure the person has the best life they can have in that time. Letting Covid rip through homes and these people become infected is hardly delivering people the best quality of life that they can have.” Some of the homes with high numbers of deaths contacted by Guardian Australia said most who died had serious underlying health conditions, and that Covid-19 was not considered to be the primary cause of death. But Butler said residents with the virus would be put into isolation, potentially unable to be with their family in their final days. “So the fact that they are palliative or have other conditions is irrelevant, aside from asking, how much did Covid hasten their death.” Butler said it is not the first time politicians have mentioned that many of those dying of Covid in aged care are palliative. In August, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, responding to the aged care crisis exacerbated by Covid, said: “For those of us who have had to make decisions about putting our own family, our own parents, into aged care, we have known that when we’ve done that we are putting them into pre-palliative care. We know it won’t be long in many cases …”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Butler said: “There’s no such thing as pre-palliative care. All I can say is comments like these show the largest level of disrespect you could show to elderly Australians.” The Aged and Community Services Australia CEO, Paul Sadler, said every resident of an aged care facility is entitled to the best possible care including protection against Covid and other infections. “The government must prioritise the health and wellbeing of older people, and this can be done by ensuring that the services and care they depend on is run by a safe, fully staffed, and fully supported workforce,” he said.

2/1/2022,"It happened at 4pm on the first Wednesday in our new house: an unexpected gift on my doorstep. Tucked in a brown paper bag was a pumpkin salad, a serve of tiramisu and a can of soft drink. It wasn’t something I’d normally order, or had ordered, but I accepted it on the grounds that it was for “Sam”, my partner’s name. Sam wasn’t home, but there was a chance he’d surprised me between mealtimes with this very specific order for one. As a hungry, sleep-tortured new parent I was willing to suspend my disbelief – and the fact I don’t eat pumpkin. I don’t dislike pumpkin. I simply don’t cook it, order it in restaurants or think about it at all. Nevertheless, I carried my serendipitous meal inside.  It says it’s for “Sam”, drawled the devil on my burp cloth. I was reaching for a fork when there was a hard knock at the door. It was Sam. Not my partner Sam. “Did you just take my food?” they asked, unpleasantly. “Oh, hi! Sorry!” I was already bustling down the hallway to retrieve my ostensibly honest mistake, returning with the unopened bag. “It’s just that … my partner’s name is Sam!” “Sure,” Sam said. “It really is.” “OK.” It was worse than I thought. Not only did this person believe I’d stolen their food, they thought I’d go so far as to give my partner a fake name to cover my tracks. According to them I was a stone-cold psychopath. This from a grown human who drank Sunkist. “Thanks,” Sam said, snatching the bag and storming the 12.5 metres between my door and theirs. Mine and my new neighbour’s houses were separated by a nose-height fence that revealed a forehead-up view of one another’s lives. We were particularly exposed in our kitchens, where we quickly took to avoiding each other’s eyes at our facing sinks, a silent agreement to lend the other this one small dignity. Unfortunately, we had less avoidable senses at our disposal. My neighbour heard every babble and demonic scream from my place, and I heard every exasperated conversation from theirs. Once they imitated my two-year-old’s tantrum after a particularly harrowing afternoon during lockdown. I retaliated by feeding the kid spoonfuls of Nutella before bedtime and leaving the windows open wide. Late one night, my neighbour was entertaining guests in their living room, directly opposite my baby’s room. They were playing my favourite Hole album, appropriately titled Live Through This, and screaming to Courtney Love’s pearly vitriol. My baby was screaming, too. I tried texting and knocking in my pyjamas. When both tactics failed to get a response, I resorted to throwing six drink coasters at their window, first one, then two at once, then three. The window flung open. “Are you right?!” Sam said, in a tone one might adopt when addressing a stone-cold psychopath. No. You’re playing an album that I’d forgotten about because I’ve disappeared into a life that doesn’t feel like mine and I’m profoundly lonely. Can we at least be friendly? “I’ve got a crying baby,” I said, in the tone of someone supremely confident in their choices. “Can you please turn it down?” The drink coasters appeared in my letterbox the following day, bound together with a disturbing amount of sticky tape. Months later, when our frisbee went sailing over the fence, my neighbour claimed not to have it. I imagined they had big plans to cut it up and mail it back to us, piece by piece. We had a lot in common, my neighbour and I, like the fact neither of us valued our privacy enough to attach a basic extension to the fence. Instead, we chose to peripherally hate-watch each other like an early-aughts, surveillance-style reality show like Britney and Kevin: Chaotic or Big Brother Australia, the season it got axed. There was a cosiness there, too. As the pandemic settled in and the world outside got less familiar, I knew my neighbour Sam’s life would be playing in the background. I knew they quit smoking whenever they were dating someone. They knew I almost got divorced over a fight about the laundry basket. Not the laundry. Just the basket. One New Year’s Eve, I sat in my backyard with a glass of wine. Cigarette smoke curled into the air from the other side of the fence. “Hey, Sam,” I said. “Hey, Ashe.” “Happy New Year.” “You, too.” “Can I bum a ciggie?” Sam laughed, pleasantly. “You’re a scumbag.” I laughed. “Look who’s talking.” The air crackled with the spark of something new. Me: “In another life we’d be friends.” Sam: “Maybe in a parallel universe, we already are.”  Ashe Davenport is a writer and author",Opinion/Opinion,"Amid the noise complaints and stolen food delivery, my neighbour and I became good frenemies | Ashe Davenport",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/01/amid-the-noise-complaints-and-stolen-food-delivery-my-neighbour-and-i-become-good-frenemies
2/1/2022,"Sue Gray’s highly anticipated report into alleged lockdown-busting parties at Downing Street dominates the headlines in today’s newspapers.
