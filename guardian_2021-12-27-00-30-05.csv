12/27/2021,"Libya’s political crisis has taken on an increasingly international dimension after the UK was accused of defending corruption and interfering in internal processes by calling for the interim government to remain in power pending the rescheduling of delayed elections. The country’s first presidential elections, scheduled for 24 December, were indefinitely postponed at the last minute, largely because fierce disagreements over who should be allowed to stand had not been resolved.  On the day the vote should have taken place, the UK in Libya Twitter account published a message saying it continued to recognise the interim government of national unity “as the authority tasked with leading Libya to elections and does not endorse the establishment of parallel governments or institutions”. In response the foreign affairs committee of the House of Representatives, Libya’s parliament, accused the UK ambassador, Caroline Hurndall, of violating diplomatic norms and unwarranted interference. The committee said only the House of Representatives – which has been accused of seeking to delay and even disrupt any elections – could decide on the role of the interim government. Some tribes went further, calling for Hurndall to be expelled. Fathi Bashagha, a presidential candidate and former interior minister, said: “Corruption is leading Libya to bankruptcy. We want to ask Britain a question: why does the British government apply the best anticorruption standards in its country, and want to protect corruption in Libya? Why is Britain defending the government and financial institutions in Libya?” The vote was intended to mark a fresh start for the oil-rich country, a year after a landmark ceasefire and more than a decade after its 2011 revolt that toppled and killed the dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Libya’s parliament is to meet on Monday to debate a new timeline and discuss the mandate of the current interim government, which was meant to end on Friday with the elections. Various factions and international powers are jockeying for position, amid concerns the political vacuum will lead to the resumption of fighting. The Tripoli-based unity administration is headed by Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, a tycoon who wants to run for president even though he pledged not to when he took up his current post. Analysts have suggested his rivals may wish to exploit the delay in order to put him out of the picture. Two other would-be candidates are particularly controversial: Gaddafi’s son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, a divisive symbol of the old regime who is wanted by the international criminal court over war crimes allegations, and the warlord Khalifa Haftar, whose eastern-based forces staged a 16-month siege of Tripoli before last year’s ceasefire. The dispute over candidates’ eligibility reflects a deeper east-west disunity that has not been resolved. Haftar has been credited at various times with the support of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates and has been opposed by Turkey, which has backed militias from the west defending Tripoli with fighters and arms. It was not clear why the UK was singled out for such strong criticism given that a joint statement issued by the UK, France, Germany, Italy, and the US also called for the current interim government to remain in power pending swiftly reorganised elections. In an apparent reference to Dbeibah, the statement said: “To avoid conflicts of interests and to promote a level playing field, candidates holding roles in public institutions should also continue vacating them until the announcement of the electoral results.” The western powers said they also backed the UN’s “call for disagreements on emerging political or military matters to be resolved without resorting to violence. We stand ready to hold to account those who threaten the stability or undermine the political and electoral process in Libya.” Najla El-Mangoush, the interim government’s foreign minister, appeared to slow the drive to elections by saying national unity was a precondition. “At this crucial moment in the history of Libya, we, Libyans and the international community, must realise that elections are a tool to achieve stability and not a specific goal,” she tweeted. “The elections should be based on the principle of reconciliation, a constitutional basis, and the unification of institutions.” Some observers have long doubted whether free elections are feasible in a country in which as many as 20,000 foreign forces including mercenaries are on the loose. Referencing protests over the postponement, Fadel Lamen, another presidential candidate, tweeted: “The demonstrations in Benghazi and Tripoli on Saturday are a real testimony to the will of the people and their insistence to have their voices heard and their votes counted. They voted with their feet to make sure that nobody domestic or intentional can deprive them.”",News/World news,UK accused of defending corruption in Libya with election tweet,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/26/uk-accused-defending-corruption-libya-election-tweet
12/27/2021,"Throughout 2021, I have accepted some important truths: I sometimes feel loneliness like an anvil on my chest; exercising really does, annoyingly, make me feel better; I am lost without a murder drama series on the go. This has been the year of the re-watch – Happy Valley, The Bridge, Unforgotten and The Killing. These shows are richly different and should not be reduced to basic tropes, but they do all share a strong-but-flawed female detective in whom you can invest emotionally. And do I. In a year stained by uncertainty, loss, health issues and boredom, spending my evenings absorbing the lives of fictional female police officers has been medicinal. That murder is a balm is perhaps something for a therapy session, but the determination and bruised souls of Sarah Lancashire’s Catherine Cawood, Nicola Walker’s Cassie Stuart , Sofia Helin’s Saga Norén and Sofie Gråbøl’s Sarah Lund have held my attention like nothing else – even the second or third time around.  I watched The Killing for the third time as summer petered out and felt particularly captivated by Lund: the forensic gaze, the abruptness, the walking out of rooms when she’s had enough of someone, the lovely face that wears remorse for which she can rarely find words. Lund isn’t real, but my experience of her is; watching a woman use her brilliant brain when mine felt like mushroom soup was just right. I envied her drive, though her inability to sustain relationships broke my heart. She moved me, when not much else did. I explain all this to Gråbøl over Zoom. When she pops up, I have the feeling of seeing an old friend. “What you’re saying is very touching,” she says. “I felt so at home in this character, which is a paradox because she wasn’t a pleasant person to inhabit. She has a strong connection to what feels right, yet there was something very lonely about her.” While filming The Killing, Gråbøl was “in another world”. When they stopped, “it was like when you’re a kid and creating a world while playing, then your parent opens the door and says: ‘It’s dinner time!’ A bubble burst.” We discuss the power of art in giving us other worlds to inhabit – something many of us have needed this year. “At the root of the human experience is a need to be mirrored, to have different languages for what we go through,” she says. I tell Gråbøl that my friend and I, watching The Killing simultaneously, kept sending each other a screenshot of Lund with slightly wild hair as an investigation becomes all-consuming. Her vague unkemptness spoke to us in our less-vague detachment from personal grooming as the ennui of the pandemic rumbled on. Gråbøl laughs into her cup of tea: “I don’t know whether to take that as a compliment or an insult!” It has been “a massive year-and-a-half” for Gråbøl. She bought a house for the first time. “I’ve always been frightened of tying myself financially like that because my work life is so uncertain,” she says. “An anxiety of uncertainty is rooted in me and has been since I was a child, before I had the language for it. But I had longed for a little garden, so I just went for it.” As well as working on the film Rose with The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo’s director, Niels Arden Oplev, in which she plays a woman with schizophrenia, Gråbøl filmed The Shift, a new series directed by Lone Scherfig (An Education), playing the midwife Ella, in a maternity ward at a Danish hospital. In July, Gråbøl had a two-week break. During this time, her mother, who had been having cancer treatment, became very ill. “It has always been my big fear that someone close to me would fall ill because, in my line of work, you can’t just say: ‘I’m leaving now,’” she explains. Those two weeks were her mother’s last. “It allowed me to be there every day, and, at the end, sleep with her in the hospice. I washed her and prepared her for the funeral, following her the whole way, really. It was beautiful. I feel privileged that my mother’s death was like a masterclass in how to die.” I am struck by her elegance in describing such a significant loss. While researching her role in The Shift, Gråbøl helped to deliver a baby in a real maternity ward. “I have given birth to two children, but: wow,” she smiles, wide-eyed. “Witnessing a birth is something else. I had never seen a birth or a death, but experienced both within the same month. Birth and death are bubbles of their own; the outside world becomes almost fictional. There is nothing else.” Understandably, Gråbøl feels like the “tectonic plates” of her being have shifted. “We are cleaning out my mother’s apartment and my son is going to move in. So many huge changes have happened and the pandemic being the background to it all has felt quite appropriate,” she says. “The landscape has shifted, but now I will start learning how to move around in it. I have the sense that the collective shock we’ve gone through with the pandemic means we all have to do this, to an extent.” As the light fades in our respective homes and we say goodbye, I think: “You’re right.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,The person who got me through 2021: Sofie Gråbøl as Sarah Lund felt like a brilliant old friend,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/26/the-person-who-got-me-through-2021-sofie-grabl-as-sarah-lund-felt-like-a-brilliant-old-friend
12/27/2021,"Publishers of the Mail on Sunday have agreed to pay “financial remedies” to the Duchess of Sussex, three years after she began a protracted privacy battle over a handwritten letter to her estranged father. On Sunday, the newspaper printed a statement at the bottom of its front page telling its readers that the duchess had won her legal case for copyright infringement against Associated Newspapers for articles published in the Mail on Sunday and posted on Mail Online.  On page three it ran a 64-word news story stating it had infringed copyright and that “financial remedies have been agreed.” The story was also published on the Mail Online website at 11.58pm on Christmas Day with links to judgments made by courts. The duchess sued Associated Newspapers over five articles reproducing extracts from a “personal and private” letter to Thomas Markle in August 2018. She won her case earlier this year when the high court judge Lord Justice Warby gave summary judgment in her favour without the need for a trial. Associated Newspapers appealed on the grounds that the case should have gone to trial. That appeal was dismissed earlier this month by court of appeal judges Sir Geoffrey Vos, Dame Victoria Sharp and Lord Justice Bean. They ruled that the duchess had a “reasonable expectation” of privacy regarding the contents of the letter. “Those contents were personal, private and not matters of legitimate public interest,” Vos said. Afterwards the duchess called for a reshaping of the tabloid industry and spoke of how she had been patient in the face of “deception, intimidation, and calculated attacks”. In her statement she said: “This is a victory not just for me, but for anyone who has ever felt scared to stand up for what’s right. While this win is precedent-setting, what matters most is that we are now collectively brave enough to reshape a tabloid industry that conditions people to be cruel, and profits from the lies and pain that they create. “From day one, I have treated this lawsuit as an important measure of right versus wrong. The defendant has treated it as a game with no rules. The longer they dragged it out, the more they could twist facts and manipulate the public (even during the appeal itself), making a straightforward case extraordinarily convoluted in order to generate more headlines and sell more newspapers – a model that rewards chaos above truth. “In the nearly three years since this began, I have been patient in the face of deception, intimidation, and calculated attacks. Today, the courts ruled in my favour – again – cementing that the Mail on Sunday, owned by Lord Jonathan Rothermere, has broken the law. The courts have held the defendant to account, and my hope is that we all begin to do the same. Because as far removed as it may seem from your personal life, it’s not. “Tomorrow it could be you. These harmful practices don’t happen once in a blue moon – they are a daily fail that divide us, and we all deserve better.” Associated Newspapers said at the time that it was “very disappointed” by the ruling and an appeal to the supreme court was being considered. The duchess’s costs had been estimated at £1.5m before the appeal, but that figure will have increased with the appeal. The Mail on Sunday and Mail Online statement publication had been ordered by Lord Justice Warby earlier this year. In March he agreed the font size could be smaller than that asked for by the duchess. Representatives of Associated Newspapers and the Duchess of Sussex have been approached for comment.",News/Media,Mail on Sunday publishers to pay ‘financial remedies’ to Duchess of Sussex,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/dec/26/mail-on-sunday-publishers-to-pay-financial-remedies-to-duchess-of-sussex
