5/19/2022,"Can you put a dollar amount on what it means to be wealthy in the U.S.? An annual survey asks Americans to do just that, and this year, $2.2 million is the magic number. That's according to the annual Modern Wealth Survey from Charles Schwab, which also finds people believe that an average net worth of $774,000 is what it takes to be financially comfortable. The report, which surveyed 1,000 Americans ages 21 to 75 in February 2022, asked respondents a range of questions about their personal finances, including the factors influencing their savings and investment decisions. The average net worth needed to be considered wealthy and to be financially comfortable both rose from last year's survey. In 2021, Americans said they needed $624,000 in net assets to live comfortably, while it would take $1.9 million to be rich. That said, the averages are still lower than they were before the COVID-19 pandemic, likely because many people are focusing less on hitting a specific number and more on their overall goals, financial and otherwise, says Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning, retirement income, and wealth management at Charles Schwab. ""People are concerned about other things besides the balance in their portfolio and in their investment account,"" says Williams, including their physical health and overall stability. The average net worth of U.S. households actually isn't so far off from Schwab's survey: It stood at $748,800 in 2019, according to the most recent Survey of Consumer Finances by the Federal Reserve. But that's skewed by the richest households. The median net worth for U.S. households is $121,700, per the Fed. And as other reports have found, many U.S. households have very little or no savings at all. With little saved for emergencies or retirement, a number like $2.2 million—or even $774,000—might seem like an impossible benchmark to reach. But Williams says this doesn't have to be the case. Ultimately, each household should calculate their own wealth target and make an individualized savings plan. What one person or family needs isn't the same as another. ""A plan is really just saying, this is what’s important to me, this is what I need to save and invest for next year, in five years, 10 years from now,"" says Williams. Once you have some idea of a target, the most important thing you can do is start saving—no matter how much or how little you can put away. Five dollars is better than nothing, even if it doesn't seem like it will add up to much at first. Putting even a little bit of money away consistently is especially important when building a retirement account, as most Americans will be on their own to fund their golden years, says Williams. ""No matter how much money you have, get started and stay disciplined,"" he says. ""You’ll look back and say, Goodness, those small steps really built up over time. You’ll find yourself in a position where you can make a lot more choices than you could before."" Once you start saving, make it an automatic ritual. Oftentimes, watching your savings accrue will provide the momentum to keep saving more and more, even if you're just starting out or well below your target number, says Williams. Keeping the long game in mind is critical, especially in a rocky market like we're seeing right now. Building wealth, for most people, takes decades of dedicated investments. Though investing money in assets that are on a losing streak can seem self-defeating, a down market is ""an opportunity to be saving and investing more,"" says Williams — and getting more for your money. ""If you’re investing for net worth, it takes time to get there,"" he says. ""It's good to be aspirational, but get started and don’t get overwhelmed by trying to get to a certain number in a day or a week.""

5/19/2022,"By Josh Smith and Hyonhee Shin SEOUL (Reuters) - Despite battling a wave of suspected COVID-19 infections, North Korea appears to be preparing to test an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) ahead of U.S. President Joe Biden's first trip to South Korea, South Korean and U.S. officials said. An ICBM test appeared imminent, Deputy National Security Adviser Kim Tae-hyo told a briefing in Seoul. ""If there is a small or large North Korean provocation during the summit period, we have prepared Plan B,"" he said. That plan would secure the combined U.S. and South Korea military forces' defence posture and command and control systems, even if it requires changing the summit schedule, Kim said. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the latest intelligence showed North Korea could carry out an ICBM test as soon as Thursday or Friday. Biden is expected to arrive in South Korea on Friday and hold talks with his South Korean counterparts over several days before visiting Japan. The White House said last week Biden was considering a trip to the Demilitarized Zone on the border with North Korea, but Kim said that seemed unlikely. A weapons test could overshadow Biden's broader focus on China, trade, and other regional issues, and underscore the lack of progress in denuclearisation talks despite his administration's vow to break the stalemate with practical approaches. It could also complicate international efforts to offer Pyongyang aid as it battles its first confirmed COVID outbreak. The trip is Biden's first to the region as president, and will be the first summit with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, who took office on May 10. Yoon has vowed to take a harder line against North Korean ""provocations,"" and is expected to seek greater assurances from Biden that the United States will strengthen its ""extended deterrence"" against the North. The Yoon administration has asked the United States to station more nuclear-capable ""strategic assets"" such as long-range bombers, submarines, and aircraft carriers in the region. The chances of North Korea conducting a nuclear test this weekend appear low, but if the North stages any major provocation, such assets are ready to be mobilised, Kim said. U.S. officials had warned that the North could test a nuclear weapon around the visit, and the State Department said on Tuesday there is no expectation that the COVID outbreak would change Pyongyang's determination to eventually resume nuclear testing, paused since 2017. ""Even as (North Korea) continues to refuse the donation of ... apparently much-needed COVID vaccines, they continue to invest untold sums in ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes that do nothing to alleviate the humanitarian plight of the North Korean people,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price told a briefing. A new report by the U.S.-based Center for International and Strategic Studies (CSIS) said commercial satellite imagery shows work continuing at the nuclear site, whose underground testing tunnels were shuttered in 2018 after leader Kim Jong Un declared a moratorium on nuclear and ICBM tests. He has since said that the country is no longer bound by that moratorium because of a lack of progress in talks with the United States. The North resumed testing ICBMs in March. ""The timing of this test rests solely within the hands of Kim Jong Un,"" the CSIS report on the nuclear site said. North Korea has also resumed construction at a long-dormant nuclear reactor that would increase its production of plutonium for nuclear weapons by a factor of 10, researchers at the U.S.-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) reported last week, citing satellite imagery. Analysts say that even if North Korea tests a weapon, South Korea and the United States should offer unconditional COVID aid. North Korea sent aircraft to China to pick up medical supplies days after it confirmed its first COVID-19 outbreak, media reported on Tuesday, but Pyongyang has yet to respond to offers of aid from South Korea. Washington says that it supports providing assistance to North Korea, but that there were no current plans to provide vaccines.
