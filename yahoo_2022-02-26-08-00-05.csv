2/26/2022,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un the significance of cooperation between the two countries, North Korea's state media KCNA reported on Saturday. In a message to Kim, Xi said China is ready to work, together with the Korean side, to steadily develop the China-DPRK relations of friendship and cooperation ... ""under a new situation"", KCNA said. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is North Korea's official name. KCNA did not further elaborate on the nature of ""a new situation."" Xi made the remarks in response to Kim's congratulatory message for the Beijing Winter Olympics Games and a verbal message of congratulation soon after the successful closing of the games, according to KCNA. Earlier this week, Kim, in a verbal message to Xi, vowed to strengthen cooperation with China and together ""frustrate"" threats and hostile policies from the United States and its allies. North Korea did not participate in the Games, which ended on Sunday. In a previous letter from sports authorities in January, North Korea blamed ""hostile forces"" and COVID-19 risks for not being able to attend. North Korean athletes were not eligible to compete under their national flag after the country failed to send a team to the Tokyo Summer Olympics last year, citing COVID-19 concerns. China has been North Korea's only major ally since the two signed a treaty in 1961.

2/26/2022,"Louisiana Republican U.S. Sens. John Kennedy and Bill Cassidy both said they're reserving judgement on Democratic President Joe Biden's nomination of U.S. Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. If Jackson is confirmed by the U.S. Senate she will be the first Black woman to serve on the nation's highest court. Biden announced Friday his intent to nominate Jackson. Kennedy serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee that will hold hearings on Jackson's nomination.

Cassidy said he will similarly vet Jackson and her credentials. “Potential Supreme Court justices must be committed to strictly upholding the rule of law, applying the law as written, and respecting Americans’ Constitutional rights, especially individual freedoms,"" Cassidy said in a statement. ""I look forward to meeting with Judge Jackson in person and will thoroughly review her record.” If confirmed Jackson will replace retiring Associate Justice Stephen Breyer, who is considered a liberal on the conservative-majority court.
