2/3/2022,"Morning everyone. This is Martin Farrer bringing you the top stories this morning.  A hastily assembled package of measures to ameliorate the impact of the cost of living crisis, including money off energy bills and more help for the poorest households, could be announced by ministers as early as today. With the Bank of England widely expected to increase interest rates again today to curb inflation, No 10 and the Treasury are under mounting pressure from Tory MPs to act as millions of households brace for a sustained assault on their budgets. A record increase in energy bills is set to kick in from April, and the likely rise in borrowing costs will see variable-rate mortgage holders paying more on their home loan every month. With the Conservatives sliding in the polls and Boris Johnson under fire over parties in No 10 during lockdown, the prime minister and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, met yesterday to stitch together a multibillion-pound package to address the cost of living crisis. Downing Street refused to comment on reports that the measures could include a £200 discount on energy bills, backed by a £5.4bn plan to make loans available to energy suppliers. There were also reports last night that Sunak was planning a council tax cut for the poorest households. With energy bills the chief concern, Ofgem is set to reveal the how much more people will have to pay. Much focus will also be on Threadneedle from midday when most City economists say the majority of members on the Bank’s rate-setting committee will increase the base rate from 0.25% to 0.5%. They expect at least two more increases will follow this year. Met crisis – A Metropolitan police officer disciplined after an inquiry into misogynistic and racist messages has since been promoted, the Guardian has learned, as Cressida Dick was warned she could lose the confidence of the mayor of London. Misconduct was proven against the unnamed officer after an inquiry into messages about hitting and raping women. The officer was promoted from constable to sergeant despite being sanctioned. Sadiq Khan had a 90-minute meeting with Dick yesterday described as “frank” and a source close to the mayor said he would consider withdrawing confidence in her if she cannot prove she is the right person to stop the rot in the country’s largest police force. PM pressure – A fresh wave of Conservative MPs have submitted letters of no confidence in Boris Johnson, breaking cover to criticise the prime minister as the fallout from the Downing Street parties scandal continued to imperil his premiership. In a sign that Johnson’s position is still under threat despite No 10’s desperate attempts to move on from the crisis, MPs Tobias Ellwood, Anthony Mangnall and Gary Streeter publicly called on him to resign. Seven MPs have now submitted no-confidence letters. Dementia clue – Having two or more chronic health problems in middle age more than doubles the risk of dementia, according to a study that researchers say underscores the importance of good health earlier in life. Work in the UK and France found that the risk of dementia was greater when conditions such as heart disease developed at a younger age (mid-50s) rather than later in life. For every five years younger a person was when multimorbidity occurred up to the age of 70 the risk of dementia went up by 18%. And another study suggests more exposure to bright daylight and dimming the lights in the evening could help to improve blood sugar control in people with pre-diabetes. Ukraine tensions – The US decision to deploy more than 3,000 US troops in Germany, Poland and Romania is a “destructive step” that makes it harder to reach a compromise over Ukraine, Russia’s deputy foreign minister said last night, as Moscow continues to build up its forces. In the latest round of diplomatic efforts to prevent a conflict, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will fly to Kyiv today to offer himself again in the role of mediator. It follows a phone call between Boris Johnson and Vladimir Putin yesterday in which the prime minister told the Russian president that invading his neighbour would be a “tragic miscalculation”, while French president Emmanuel Macron will talk to Putin and Biden in the coming days, and German leader Olaf Scholz will visit Moscow “soon”. Ship fight – A dispute has erupted over HMS Endeavour, the ship on which James Cook made his voyage to Australia, after the Australian National Maritime Museum announced it had been identified in waters off the US east coast. Despite the museum’s boss declaring he was “convinced it’s the Endeavour”, local experts denounced his comments as “premature” and driven by “Australian emotions or politics”. The Endeavour was scuttled off Rhode Island in 1778 and has been the subject of extensive exploration for decades. After a year in which the Met lurched from one crisis to another, we look at the challenges faced by the leader of the force, Cressida Dick.

The star of Atonement and X-Men talks to Arifa Akbar about partygate, snout size – and tackling Lear when he hits 100. Ashley Giles has become the first casualty from England’s horror tour of Australia after being sacked as director of men’s cricket and replaced by Andrew Strauss on an interim basis. In the latest instalment of the women’s Ashes, England have made a decent start in the one-day international round in Canberra. Great Britain’s curlers Bruce Mouat and Jennifer Dodds have continued their good start at the Winter Olympics in Beijing with an important win over fellow favourites Canada. Tom Curry is being tipped to captain England in the Calcutta Cup Six Nations opener at Murrayfield on Saturday after both Owen Farrell and Courtney Lawes succumbed to injury. The round-ball game provided all the drama north of the border last night though when Celtic beat Rangers 3-0 to go top of the Premiership thanks to two goals from the Hoops’ Japanese import, Reo Hatate. In the African Cup of Nations, Sadio Mané sealed Senegal’s progress to the final with a 3-1 win over Burkina Faso last night. And Roy Keane could be set for a surprise return to management and Wearside after it emerged that Sunderland want him as their replacement for Lee Johnson, who was sacked this week with the club third in League One. Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, became the latest tech company to suffer a dramatic share price slump last night as it reported higher costs and slowing growth. Meta’s share price dropped 20% in after-hours trading, a fall that would represent $175bn in value if it holds when trading starts again today. At home, the boss of the CBI will warn ministers today that Britain risks a cycle of low growth without massive investment to raise skills, cut red tape and exploit the opportunities of the green economy. The FTSE100 is heading for a slight dip this morning and on the foreign exchanges the pound is on $1.356 and €1.200. The government’s response to the cost of living crisis is the lead for many papers with the Mirror saying “D-Day on prices agony”, and the Mail splashing on “Energy bills to soar by £650 – now the heat is on Rishi”. The Times says “Millions of families to get cuts in council tax” and the Telegraph’s lead is “Sunak splashes out to ease bills crisis”. The FT reckons “Sunak and BoE work in tandem to head off ‘cost of living catastrophe’”. The Guardian’s main story is “Pressure on PM as more Tory MPs call for him to go”, while the i reports “No more funding to ‘level up’ UK” and the Scotsman says “Gove calls for ‘Team UK’ to support levelling up plans”.

2/3/2022,"Media outlets are supposed to report the news not become it. On Wednesday CNN found itself coming afoul of that rule when Jeff Zucker abruptly resigned from his position as network president amid lurid circumstances. In a memo sent to colleagues, Zucker explained he was stepping down after failing to disclose a “consensual relationship” with a close colleague. While Zucker didn’t name the colleague directly, Allison Gollust, CNN’s executive vice-president and chief marketing officer, has confirmed her involvement in a memo to employees. Hang on a minute. Is a powerful man really resigning from a big job because he had a consensual relationship with a colleague? That’s not the usual way of things; many men have been accused of far worse transgressions and still managed to cling to power. Well here’s some context: Gollust happens to be the former communications director for disgraced former New York governor Andrew Cuomo. And Zucker’s relationship with Gollust came up during an internal investigation into former anchor Chris Cuomo, who was fired from CNN in December after using his job to help his brother, Andrew, combat sexual harassment allegations (leading some commentators to dub CNN the “Cuomo Nepotism Network”.)  Zucker stood by Chris Cuomo for months when his conflict-of-interest scandal first hit but eventually fired him a few days after the anchor was accused of sexual misconduct by a junior colleague at another network. Like his brother, it seems Chris holds a grudge. Two sources told Politico that it was Cuomo’s legal team, which is still negotiating his exit from the network, who flagged the relationship between Zucker and Gollust. A reporter from media startup Puck News has also claimed that CNN received a letter from Cuomo’s lawyers asking for all communications between Zucker, Gollust and Cuomo to be preserved. While Zucker may not be having a very good week, Donald Trump (whose views on CNN are common knowledge) is having a ball. “Jeff Zucker, a world-class sleazebag who has headed ratings and real-news-challenged CNN for far too long, has been terminated for numerous reasons, but predominantly because CNN has lost its way with viewers,” Trump wrote in a statement. I hate to say it, but Trump has a point. You don’t have to be a cynic to reckon that CNN’s dismal ratings may factor into Zucker’s sudden departure: CNN had record ratings during the Trump years but has seen viewership plummet recently. The Cuomo scandal certainly hasn’t helped the network’s credibility: during the early days of the pandemic Chris Cuomo repeatedly interviewed his brother on air and it was largely treated like hilarious banter instead of a clear conflict of interest. And that’s hardly been the only embarrassment the network has suffered: last year Jeffrey Toobin, CNN’s chief legal analyst exposed himself on a Zoom call with colleagues. While the New Yorker fired Toobin from his staff writer position, CNN gave him a little tap on the wrist and put him back on the air. There are lots of brilliant, hard-working, journalists at CNN. However, Zucker has a storied history in reality TV (he green-lit The Apprentice during his time at NBC) and, under his stewardship, CNN has treated politics like entertainment. There have been several instances where the most basic journalistic principles have gone out of the window because “good TV” was more important. In 2016, for example, CNN hired Corey Lewandowski to be a political commentator shortly after he’d been fired as Trump’s campaign manager. They hired Lewandowski to talk about politics when the man was still collecting severance pay from Trump and had signed a contract prohibiting him from disparaging Trump. And it gets worse: in 2019, after being accused of sexual assault and boasting that he has “no obligation to be honest with the media”, CNN invited him back on air.Trust in media has declined dramatically and the media can’t just blame that on people like Trump shouting “fake news”. There is a revolving door between high-profile jobs in cable news and big jobs in government: the idea that journalists and politicians are part of an overlapping “elite” with aligned interests isn’t entirely misplaced. Take Zucker’s public “feud” with Trump, for example. Rather than being sworn enemies, the two have always had a symbiotic relationship. Back in 2016 Michael Cohen, Trump’s former fixer, secretly recorded conversations between the two in which Zucker can be heard lavishing praise on Trump, who he refers to as “the boss”. “I have all these proposals for [Trump],” Zucker says at one point in the tapes. “Like, I want to do a weekly show with him and all this stuff.” Now that Zucker and Trump are both out of jobs, perhaps they’ll finally put that weekly show together. In the meantime the fallout at CNN should be a wakeup call for everyone in media. Trust is hard to win and very easy to lose.",Opinion/Opinion,Why is trust in media plummeting? Just look at what’s happening at CNN | Arwa Mahdawi,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/03/why-is-trust-in-media-plummeting-just-look-at-whats-happening-at-cnn
2/3/2022,"Meeting then-Israeli president Reuven Rivlin in Jerusalem in May 2017, Donald Trump stunned advisers by criticising the then-prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, for being unwilling to seek peace while Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian leader, was “desperate” for a deal. The comment “knocked everyone off their chairs”, David Friedman, Trump’s ambassador to Israel, writes in a new book.  “Although the meeting was private and off the record, we all envisioned a headline tomorrow that Trump had praised Abbas and criticised Netanyahu – the worst possible dynamic for the president’s popularity or for the prospects of the peace process. “Fortunately, and incredibly, the event wasn’t leaked.” Friedman now describes the incident, and how he says he changed Trump’s mind, in Sledgehammer: How Breaking with the Past Brought Peace to the Middle East, a memoir which will be published next week by Broadside Books, a conservative imprint of HarperCollins. The Guardian obtained a copy. Trump’s bankruptcy lawyer was a hugely controversial choice for ambassador. As well as being a hardline pro-settler rightwinger, during the 2016 campaign he called Barack Obama an antisemite and J Street, a liberal US Jewish group, “worse than kapos”, Jewish prisoners who worked as guards in Nazi concentration camps. He was confirmed as ambassador by a 52-46 Senate vote. US ambassadors to Israel are usually confirmed unanimously. In his book, he says the “worse than kapos” remark was not a political or policy mistake but a tactical one, as it gave ammunition to critics in the Senate. Describing four “murder boards”, sessions in which nominees are grilled over potential problems, he says he first said he used the controversial phrase “because I felt that J Street had betrayed the Jewish people”. That, he writes, caused a “firestorm of reaction” and he was told he could not speak that way. His settled-on answer was: “In the heat of a political campaign I allowed my rhetoric to get the best of me. I regret these comments and assure you that if confirmed, my remarks will be measured and diplomatic.” Describing his confirmation process, Friedman reproduces private conversations with Democratic senators including Kirsten Gillibrand of New York (a “bad joke”), Cory Booker of New Jersey (“delightful” in person, only, Friedman writes, to turn on him in hearings), and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader. Friedman says he had donated to Schumer and the two New Yorkers spoke amicably before Friedman made a pitch for his vote, which he said would send “a strong message of bipartisanship on Israel, which you have advocated on numerous occasions”. Schumer, he says, smiled and answered: “I’m not giving Trump the win. Sorry.” Friedman also recounts an angry meeting with Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont, who he accuses of “siding with terrorists over one of America’s strongest allies”. But his description of the meeting between Trump and Rivlin and how Friedman says he turned his president round makes for more surprising reading, not least in how it appears to show how eager Trump was for a deal. Friedman describes how during Trump’s next meeting, with Netanyahu, he manoeuvred all present into viewing a “two-minute collection of Abbas’s speeches that I thought was worth watching”. The tape contained “two minutes of Abbas honouring terrorists, extolling violence, and vowing never to accept anything less than Israel’s total defeat”. “After the tape ended,” Friedman writes, “the president said, ‘Wow, is that the same guy I met in Washington last month? He seemed like such a sweet, peaceful guy.’ “The tape had clearly made an impact.” Friedman writes that he was rebuked by Rex Tillerson, Trump’s first secretary of state, and HR McMaster, Trump’s second national security adviser. “They thought it was a cheap propaganda trick,” he writes. He told them, he writes, “I work for the president, and nobody else … I am going to make sure that he is well informed so that he gets Israel policy right.” Friedman emphasises his role in such policy, prominently including closeness to Netanyahu; support for Israeli settlers on Palestinian land; cutting aid to Palestinians; recognising Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and moving the US embassy there; and diplomacy that led to the Abraham Accords, the normalisation of Israeli relations with four Arab countries. Aides to Trump, Steve Bannon famously among them, have often suffered from being seen to claim too much credit for his successes. Friedman is sure to repeatedly praise Trump, while bragging of how close to “the boss” he became. Nonetheless, his description of Trump’s private meeting with Rivlin – behaviour Friedman says would have been embarrassing had it been leaked – could prove embarrassing itself. Trump has been repeatedly burned by books on his time in power, even those written by loyalists like Friedman. In December, the Guardian was first to report that Mark Meadows, Trump’s last chief of staff, described how the president tested positive for Covid-19 before his first debate with Joe Biden – and how the result was covered up.",Arts/Books,"Trump risked disaster with Abbas praise in key Israel meeting, ambassador says",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/03/donald-trump-israel-david-friedman-book-abbas-netanyahu-peace
2/3/2022,"Thousands of children are falling through the cracks in youth addiction services owing to Covid, staff shortages and funding cuts, psychiatrists have said, as figures suggest the number able to get help has fallen to the lowest on record. Analysis of data from the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System (NDTMS) found that 11,013 under-18s were in treatment for drug and alcohol dependency in England in 2020-21, which was 3,278 fewer (23% less) than in 2019-20. It was the sharpest annual fall since records began, and means 13,481 fewer children were being treated than at a peak in 2008-09.  The vast majority of children in treatment (89%, or 9,832) had a problem with cannabis and 41% (4,459) had a problem with alcohol. About 12% (1,333) were struggling with ecstasy use and 9% (976) reported a problem with powder cocaine. The Royal College of Psychiatrists, which analysed the data, said the pandemic, together with “drastic” historical funding cuts, was preventing young people from accessing the drug and alcohol treatment they need, potentially condemning them to a life of addiction. It said spending on youth addiction services in England had been cut by 41% in real terms since 2013-14, to £43.19m in 2020-21, with two regions cutting spending by 60% or more. Every region in England had made real-terms funding cuts since 2013-14, ranging from 8% in Yorkshire and Humber to 61% in the West Midlands, it said. Dr Emily Finch, the vice-chair of the addictions faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “Children and their families up and down the country are having their lives blighted by drug and alcohol use due to drastic cuts, workforce shortages and the impact of the pandemic. “Addiction is a treatable health condition. Intervening early will mean many kids won’t go on to have an addiction in their adulthood, keeping them out of the criminal justice system and helping them to live full lives. It’s now time for the government to act on their promise and deliver the multimillion-pound investment into drug services.” The Department of Health and Social Care said it recognised the impact the pandemic had had on children and young people and it was committed to supporting those suffering from drug and alcohol misuse. A spokesperson said: “We are taking action through our landmark 10-year drug strategy, backed by a record £780m for treatment – this includes £533m over three years to rebuild substance misuse treatment services in England to ensure those misusing drugs and alcohol get the support they need to recover. “This is on top of our mental health recovery action plan, which includes an additional £79m funding that will be used to expand children’s mental health services in 2021-22.”",News/Society,Fewest under-18s on record getting addiction help in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/03/fewest-under-18s-on-record-getting-addiction-help-in-england
2/3/2022,"In the beginning it felt like a particularly overzealous PR campaign. When the actor Julia Fox posted a picture of her and her new partner in matching leather outfits on her Instagram story last week captioned “Juliye”, it felt less like the confirmation of a relationship and more like an asset in a film release schedule. “You’re either born a muse, or you’re not,” stated Julia Fox in her latest, apparently bi-weekly column about the new relationship in Interview Magazine. “I’ve always been someone’s muse.”  Fox is the latest muse, and also girlfriend, of Kanye West – or Ye as he now prefers to be called. But the line between relationship and art project has been consistently blurred since the pair met on New Year’s Eve in Miami, where they had an “instant connection”. Fox is technically an interview subject in these Interview Magazine columns, yet it is clear that she’s the one calling the shots. “I’ll send pictures, I’ll tell you stories. And you’ll publish them … let’s call it 'This Week in Fox News,” she tells an unnamed Interview journalist. The resulting column, indeed titled Fox News, feels like a merchandisable asset of their burgeoning relationship. Fox is Ye’s first girlfriend since separating from Kim Kardashian last year. The new couple have been photographed in a series of high-profile, staged photoshoots. One saw them canoodling and trying on clothes in a hotel suite surrounded by assistants, another saw Fox dressed in an all-black custom leather outfit with echoes of her past as a professional dominatrix as she lay across a dinner table while Kanye pretends he is about to tuck in to her with a knife and fork. They have since been photographed wearing increasingly outlandish matching outfits everywhere from New York to LA to Paris Fashion week, where they made their red carpet debut at Kenzo in coordinated denim ensembles, accessorized with black gloves, and Julia’s trademark Black Swan-extra eye makeup, which looks as though she went to a child’s summer fete and asked for “a Batman”, but is actually applied by Ye himself. What to make of this whirlwind romance, one month on from when the pair first met? Is it a genuine and unexpected intimate collaboration, or is the whole thing a performance art piece about celebrity divorce sponsored by Balenciaga and Interview Magazine? Julia Fox’s first major brush with mainstream fame came in 2009 when she was cast in her debut film, Uncut Gems, by the sibling directors Benny and Josh Safdie, who she had met nearly a decade prior at SoHo cafe Jack’s Wife Freda. The film, a high-stress rollercoaster following a charismatic jeweler and gambling addict played by Adam Sandler, and set in New York’s Diamond District, saw Julia playing a version of herself, a magnetic go-getter with an unwavering trust in her erratic partner that borders on the devotional. “Being independent, resilient, being a hustler, having a ride-or-die mentality, and overall just being really cute,” she responded in a 2020 interview when asked what qualities she shared with her on-screen character. Her arrival on screen as Adam Sandler’s mistress was an explosion of a first performance, and earned her a nomination for the breakthrough actor award at the 2019 Gotham awards. But before that, Fox had already lived many lives: as a teenage dominatrix, a glamorous downtown party girl and club kid, successful knitwear designer, model, exhibiting painter and photographer. Fox told Office magazine this month that “people don’t take you seriously if you’re a creative and also a sex worker” and believes that until now she has missed out on opportunities and endorsements. Friends of Fox often describe her as having a magnetic personality. Josh Safdie told the New York Times about casting Fox in Uncut Gems, “I remember stumbling into her universe through a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend … and at first, you couldn’t quite figure out the type of person that she was, and it was very, very alluring. It was exciting. She was constantly redefining who you thought you were talking to.” The author Cat Marnell, told the Cut that Fox was “a legitimate sorceress. She’s the Michael Jordan of vixens … she’s devastating, like a hurricane.” Fox, who is now sober, also struggled with heroin and pill addiction during her teenage years, and mined her tumultuous experiences to create and self-publish two art books about abuse, addiction and sex work. In 2017, she held a funeral for herself to celebrate the end of a chapter in her impossibly varied life – in the form of an art exhibition titled RIP Julia Fox that featured silk canvases painted in her own blood. When asked if it was difficult to reinvent herself as an auteur, Fox responded: “I hadn’t planned on it at all. It just kind of happened organically,” echoing the words she would use five years later to describe dating her famous boyfriend. She also has her Spotify podcast Forbidden Fruits – co-hosted by veteran LA party girl Niki Takesh – where once again the main topic of discussion is Julia herself (as well as “the issues that the world is too afraid to touch”) with help from guests that can include anyone from Real Housewives stars to former cult members. She has also used the platform to candidly discuss her blossoming relationship with Ye on her own terms. “It’s really such a Gemini/Aquarius connection. It’s very inspirational … what’s really exciting about him is that any idea can become a reality, anything is possible, any dream is possible and I love that.” Although, pushed on what some of these ideas and realities are, their excitingness is debatable. She says she has decided that her “latest vibe” is “canceling cancel culture and putting an end to this black-and-white thinking” because “people shouldn’t be defined by their darkest moment” – which sounds like a noble cause until you realize the column is running alongside photos of Fox with Marilyn Manson, whose “darkest moments” include allegations of psychological, physical and sexual abuse against more than 16 women. Although many were initially confused at the “left field” pairing of Ye and the relatively unknown Fox, it seems the two have more in common than first thought: a penchant for dressing up in ridiculous clothes, the narcissistic mindset necessary to become famous in the first place, and no qualms about partying with convicted abusers. They also seem to share an interest in life as performance art, presenting their own daily undertakings as entertainment and blurring the line between reality and reality TV. On her podcast she declared: “All the people that [West and I] have in common have texted me and been like, ‘Oh my God, this makes so much sense.’”",Arts/Music,From dominatrix to debutante: who is the real Julia Fox?,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/03/julia-fox-who-is-kanye-west-girlfriend
2/3/2022,"Severe floods and other extreme weather have cost Europe about half a trillion euros in the past four decades, with Germany, France and Italy the worst-hit countries. Between 90,000 and 142,000 deaths were attributed to weather and climate-related events over the period 1980 to 2020, the overwhelming majority of them from heatwaves.  The data, published by the European Environment Agency on Thursday, does not show a clear trend of increase in losses over the decades from the impact of the climate crisis. This is because the economic impacts tend to be concentrated in a few major events – more than 60% of the economic losses came from just 3% of the weather events over the period – and these can strike anywhere and cause vastly different results. Wouter Vanneuville, of the EEA, one of the lead authors of the study, said: “There is no clear pattern for the most extreme events – they are still random, to a large extent. But adaptation is ongoing and is having an impact.” He said the fact that losses were not clearly increasing should not make people complacent, but underlined the importance of adapting infrastructure and making preparations for extreme weather, which is likely to become more frequent and intense as the climate crisis progresses and temperatures increase. “The reason we don’t see a trend is not that climate change is not real, but because a lot of actions are going on against climate change. More and more countries are implementing adaptation strategies,” he said. Countries should invest further in adaptation, he said, as progress on protecting against the effects of the climate crisis varied widely across Europe. “Even if we reach net zero emissions before 2050, adaptation will still be needed to keep the impacts limited,” he said. The UK has opted out of membership of the EEA, Europe’s environmental watchdog, since Brexit, though other non-EU states such as Norway and Switzerland are members, and the EEA data covers 32 countries of which five are non-EU. However, the UK was a member for the period studied, and its losses were calculated at about €57bn over the period, equivalent to close to €1,000 per person, with 3,500 deaths. About 70% of the economic losses were insured, the highest value of any of the countries. The worst economic damage was caused by “hydrological” events – largely floods – which accounted for up to 44% of the losses, closely followed by damage from “meteorological” events – mainly storms – which amounted to up to 39%, depending on the dataset used. The EEA collated the data on economic losses from insurers and other commercial sources which had slightly different methodologies, giving a spread of estimates for the losses over the period of between €450bn and €520bn depending on the datasets used. Just under a quarter (23%) of losses over the period were insured, though these rates varied widely among countries, with more than half of losses insured in Denmark and the Netherlands, and only about 1% in Lithuania and Romania. Switzerland, Slovenia and France had the highest losses per capita over the period, and the highest losses relative to area were in Switzerland, Germany and Italy.",News/World news,Extreme weather has cost Europe about €500bn over 40 years,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/extreme-weather-has-cost-europe-about-500bn-over-40-years
2/3/2022,"LBC’s left-leaning mid-morning presenter James O’Brien now has more listeners than breakfast show host Nick Ferrari, in the latest indication that British radio listening habits have changed substantially during the pandemic. For decades the breakfast show slot has been the highest-profile programme on almost every radio station, usually garnering the most listeners. Audiences traditionally increased as people turned on the radio when they got up in the morning and continued listening if they drove to work in a car, only to fall away after 8am as they turned up at work.  Yet the substantial increase in working from home during the pandemic, increased listening on the move via smartphones and the popularity of presenters with particularly strong personal followings are now upending this longstanding industry rule – with audiences peaking much later in the morning. The change is particularly symbolic at LBC, which over the last decade has transformed itself from a London-only station known for phone-in shows into a national speech radio station with consistently rising ratings. Official RAJAR listener figures, released on Thursday, show that Ferrari, the longstanding breakfast show host known for hisbruising tabloid style, now reaches 1.295m listeners for his 7am-10am programme. By comparison, O’Brien has edged narrowly ahead with 1.307m listeners for his lengthy critiques of Boris Johnson’s government during his 10am to 1pm slot. Elsewhere, the listening figures for the final three months of 2021 show the audiences for major national BBC radio stations remained largely flat. Radio 2 remains the most popular station in the country with almost 15m listeners a week, while Zoë Ball has slightly rebuilt the audience for her Radio 2 breakfast show to 7.5m listeners – still the most popular programme in the country but some way down on the highs hit by her predecessor Chris Evans. Yet commercial radio stations continue to gain ground on the BBC, with advertising-supported outlets already substantially outperforming the public broadcaster among listeners aged under 45. At the same time, the number of younger listeners using streaming apps on their phones to listen to radio has continued to increase rapidly. As a result, the BBC is increasingly trying to future-proof its audience by pushing audio listeners towards its BBC Sounds app, and is putting episodes of popular shows such as Desert Islands Discs online before they are broadcast on Radio 4. Rupert Murdoch’s TimesRadio, the upmarket speech radio station launched last summer, was one of the biggest losers as it shed a fifth of its audience since the previous quarter and dipped to 502,000 listeners a week. It was overtaken by its more bellicose sister station talkRadio, which now attracts a record audience, aided by debates about whether it is possible to grow concrete. In commercial music radio, Heart remained the biggest brand with 10.2m listeners across its stations, while the Chris Moyles-fronted Radio X grew its audience substantially to 2.1m listeners a week. The national Hits network, formed by merging a number of previously independent local radio stations and largely replacing their distinct identities with national programming, lost 8% of its audience to reach 5.6m listeners. Radio audience research was suspended for most of the pandemic due to lockdown restrictions, meaning there are no comparable year-on-year figures. Most of the listening figures are collected by members of the public keeping diaries of their listening, although some data is now collected through a mobile phone app that monitors background noise and checks if it is a radio station.",News/Media,LBC’s James O’Brien overtakes Nick Ferrari as radio audiences tune in later,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/03/lbcs-james-obrien-overtakes-nick-ferrari-as-radio-audiences-tune-in-later
2/3/2022,"Britons are braced for the Bank of England to increase interest rates on Thursday as the central bank seeks to tackle price pressures that have pushed annual inflation to a 30-year high of 5.4%. Most City economists said the majority of members on the Bank’s rate-setting committee would increase the base rate from 0.25% to 0.5%, with the likelihood that at least two more increases would follow during 2022.  On the eve of the Bank’s decision, 29 economists from 45 respondents to a survey by Reuters predicted that the monetary policy committee (MPC) would go ahead with a rise, while 16 forecast that rates were likely to remain on hold. High-street lenders are expected to increase the cost of variable-rate mortgages immediately after the vote, adding to the cost of living crisis facing many of those borrowing to buy a home. Rents are also likely to increase as landlords pass on the cost of borrowing to tenants, though savers will enjoy a long-awaited rise in the interest paid on deposit accounts. A separate survey by the data compiler IHS Markit found that 49% of households – a record high – believe that Threadneedle Street policymakers will impose at least one rate rise in the next three months. IHS Markit said it was clear that the MPC’s surprise vote in December to increase the base rate from 0.1% to 0.25%, and to signal three rate rises to 1% this year, had filtered through to the public. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: “UK households have grown increasingly certain of the Bank of England hiking interest rates for a second meeting in succession, with expectations of tighter policy having spiked higher since last October as inflation worries took hold.” He said recent surveys of business activity had shown the economy was “displaying encouraging resilience in the face of the Omicron [coronavirus] wave”, while employment agencies had reported that wage growth rose sharply as employers competed to attract staff amid widespread labour shortages. “With the Omicron wave already ebbing and virus containment measures eased, there’s a good chance that the pace of economic growth will accelerate in coming months, which will likely add to speculation that further rate hikes are on the table as we head into spring,” said Williamson. Pressure on the Bank has grown after a surge in the price of energy, secondhand cars, food and household goods that pushed the consumer prices index (CPI) to 5.4% in December and the retail prices index (RPI), which is used for wage bargaining, to 7%. The Bank aims to keep inflation at 2% over a two- to three-year period. High demand for goods during a succession of lockdowns, combined with shortages caused by Covid-related delays made worse by hold-ups at UK ports due to Brexit, has pushed up prices. Grocery prices rose 3.8% over the four weeks to 23 January compared with the same period last year, according to the market research company Kantar. It said prices were rising fastest for fresh beef and poultry, savoury snacks, crisps, skincare and cat food, offset by falls in the price of fresh bacon, vitamins and beer. Industry figures showed that a broader measure of shop price inflation almost doubled in January to the highest level for nearly a decade, pushed up by the spiralling cost of furniture and flooring. Annual inflation of goods bought from retailers rose to 1.5% last month from 0.8% in December, according to the latest data from the British Retail Consortium trade body and the market research company NielsenIQ, which is the highest level since December 2012. The energy regulator is expected to increase the price cap on gas and electricity by more than 50% to reach almost £2,000 a year on Thursday, up from an average of £1,277 this winter, to reflect record high gas prices caused by a global crisis in supply.",News/Business,UK interest rate rise predicted as cost of living crisis deepens,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/03/uk-interest-rate-rise-predicted-as-cost-of-living-crisis-deepens

2/3/2022,"In the first months of the UK’s spring 2020 lockdown, Jennifer Doyle, a teacher and single mother, was at a low point. “I was in a bit of a hole, struggling to cope on my own and focusing only on the negatives of my life,” says the 39-year-old. “Then – during a Zoom quiz, of course – my friend said I should look into manifestation to help. I did – and my energy totally shifted. I started thinking about what I wanted from life, rather than what was wrong with it.” Doyle was not alone. In early July 2020, Google Trends reported a peak in searches for “manifestation”, which is often described as a way of willing your goals into existence. In the past 22 months, the website Life Coach Directory has seen a 450% rise in potential clients searching for manifestation techniques. On TikTok, the hashtag #manifestation has 13.9bn views. It is part of the huge wellness market, which is worth about £1.1bn.  I too spent the past two years raking up existential questions in response to the world’s chaos (and my impending 30th birthday). What am I doing with my life? When will I next be able to afford a holiday? Faced with another year of broken resolutions, impending deadlines and chasing late invoices, I decided to investigate manifestation further, to see if I could find some answers – and perhaps attract some good stuff to myself. A life of wealth and leisure is the first thing that springs to mind to manifest, but how manageable is that? “Manifestation can be a slippery fish to work with,” says the psychotherapist Dr Denise Fournier. “In pragmatic terms, it is the practice of translating something from thought and idea into a tangible reality. It is a nuanced way of using intention to create an image of a goal you want to achieve and then cultivating discipline and actions that keep you oriented towards that goal.” This loose definition means manifestation can align with any number of life coaching and sports psychology principles, from visualisation and intention to self-control and self-belief. No wonder those of us stuck at home and faced with the uncertainty of the Covid world were attracted to its methods of self-improvement. “Life is always happening, but when you add intention the result is more likely to happen in your favour,” Fournier says. “It’s positive thinking,” agrees Doyle. “I always had impostor syndrome, but manifestation has helped me believe more in my life and its possibility. I break my goals down and put action into them until I start to notice things popping up.” Each morning, she writes down 10 things for which she is grateful, before spending time visualising her goals, then writing her next steps in her journal. Idecide to narrow my goal of “wealth and leisure” into something more achievable, so that I can visualise it. One of my long-held dreams is to become an author. I finished writing a novel last year, but have been dithering about sending it to agents and publishers. Now, I decide to take a leaf out of Doyle’s book and make a daily visualisation practice to become a published author. I start setting myself “actionable steps”, or tasks: editing the text, selecting agents, sending out emails. I find myself beginning each morning picturing myself wearing tweed jackets and grandly declining an OBE for services to literature, while my days are surrounded by sheets of paper and scraps of notes for edits and pitches. This is starting to feel a lot like work and a lot less like magical thinking. The popular idea of manifestation – a way of dreaming something into reality – stems largely from the 2006 book and film The Secret by the TV executive Rhonda Byrne. In it, Byrne outlines her “law of attraction” – that if you ask the universe for something and believe in its reality, you will receive it. Positive thinking attracts positive results, claims Byrne as she suggests historical figures such as Winston Churchill, Albert Einstein and even Jesus Christ used these principles in their lives. The book has sold more than 35m copies and attracted a legion of celebrity fans. Jim Carrey believes he manifested a $10m payday, Oprah Winfrey her role in The Color Purple. The Secret also has its share of detractors. In her 2009 book, Bright-Sided, Barbara Ehrenreich wrote that The Secret was part of a wellness trend that had led the US public to become self-interested and detached from political reality. The scientists Christopher F Chabris and Daniel J Simons argued in a 2010 essay that The Secret used jargon and selective history to produce an “illusion of knowledge”. The writer Mark Manson has called it “a playbook for entitlement and self-absorption”. Today’s manifesters, however, have moved away from spiritual energy. Doyle started manifesting with The Manifestation Collective, a UK-based online community run by Victoria Jackson. “The Secret is what first got me interested in manifestation, when I was working as a magazine editor,” she says. “But it can lead you into thinking that if you are having a bad year, you will manifest only bad things into your life, which I don’t think is true.” Rather, she says, “manifesting is about changing your thoughts, which in turn will affect your actions and then become habits and behaviours. It’s about letting go of the limiting belief that we can’t achieve certain things.” Raised in a working-class household in Leeds, Jackson believes manifestation helped her overcome messages that she had internalised concerning what she could achieve in her work and life. “I manifested leaving my job to set up my own business and being able to work while travelling the world,” she says. “It’s about focusing on what feels good, rather than what looks good, then being incredibly specific about your goals. We’re trying to keep them at the forefront of your mind to always work towards.” Amman Ahmed, a 34-year-old entrepreneur, also believes manifesting helped him transcend his limiting beliefs. “I grew up in an environment where working in a call centre was the norm,” he says. “In 2008, I got an internship at HP [Hewlett-Packard] and I thought I had made it, but when I discovered manifestation I realised I could do so much more than just be on the corporate ladder; I could build my life the way I wanted to.” Ahmed has since founded a multimillion-pound company, Relax My Dog, which produces music and videos for pets. “When I walked to work each morning, I was always visualising my goals,” he says. “I used to joke that I was a millionaire, but temporarily broke. You really have to live in the 3D reality of what you want to achieve and change how you think. It made me realise I wanted a certain lifestyle first and then I worked backwards on how to get there.” But doesn’t constantly focusing on your own gain breed a materialistic worldview or even narcissism? “Success can become an addiction and you have to question when it serves you and when it doesn’t,” Ahmed says. He is now reading up on meditation and ways to maintain his contentment. “Manifestation can be like therapy – consciously doing an inventory of yourself and always asking: “Why?” when it comes to behavioural patterns,” he says. “Sometimes you might have searched enough.” This constant self-assessment sounds difficult. Fournier says it can be. “It can get prickly drilling down into people’s learned behaviours, and often the things they wanted to manifest initially change,” she says. I ask her how I might help along my own manifesting. “You need to look at how you are standing in the way of your fulfilment, then explore that.” She says my goals are likely to come to fruition if I connect with my vision and “show up in my own life” – in other words, put the work in. Her response hits a nerve. Soon I am sweating and sifting through my subconscious. Am I too scared of rejection and failure to commit to trying for what I want? If my book doesn’t get published, does that mean manifesting doesn’t work – or that I am a bad writer? “If you think whatever you do is miraculously manifested, it sets us up to be disappointed when we don’t get what we want,” Fournier says. “It can also mean that we judge others who aren’t manifesting and we can ignore systemic global and contextual problems. For instance, it’s really myopic and dangerous to think people who are in poverty aren’t manifesting themselves out of it. Manifesting is merely setting intentions for your life. It’s not about placing value judgments on yourself if you don’t succeed.” Is there any science to back up the idea? In her 2019 book The Source, the neuroscientist Tara Swart wrote about neuroplasticity – the brain’s capacity to be shaped by its environment. “If we don’t take responsibility for this, then our brains are moulded by outside experiences, which can be good or bad,” Swart says. “If we focus attention on what we want to change, deliberately practise new desired behaviours and are held accountable, we can change behaviour patterns.” Alongside the manifestation company To Be Magnetic, Swart has created a method of “neural manifestation” that purports to reprogram subconscious limiting beliefs using “neuroscience, psychology, epigenetics and energetics”. If merely thinking about how I was standing in my own way made me sweat, the idea of reprogramming my subconscious sounds cultish. But another neuroscientist offers a note of caution about the use of scientific terminology. “There is a danger to using terms like epigenetics – the science of cell development, turning genes on and off to create a cellular memory,” says Dr Kevin Mitchell, an associate professor of genetics and neuroscience at Trinity College Dublin. It lends an aura of respectability to something that he describes as “woo-woo”. “The idea of a cellular memory can be conflated with psychological memory – and neuroplasticity can be broadened to encompass any changes in behaviour. Genes only influence our personality, rather than determine it,” he says. “The only positives of manifestation I see are in becoming more aware of our behaviours and paying attention to them, like in mindfulness. Habits can change, but it takes effort and determination – there is no magic of the universe at play.” Dr Caroline Hexdall, a psychologist who specialises in mindfulness, agrees. “Manifestation is attractive because it feels like something you can do to bring about happiness and success, but it’s when we accept the struggle that things change,” she says. It seems manifestation can mean anything to anyone – a euphemistic term for the daunting process of self-awareness and accountability. “Some people prefer the language of spirituality and others positive psychology,” says Alana Leggett, a life coach at the Life Coach Directory. “Since it’s such a broad term, you can mould manifestation to fit the person and their belief system so that it works with them. It mainly builds self-confidence and focus, since it’s really hard to be accountable and consistent in making changes – just look at how many people make and break their new year resolutions.” This makes sense: during the fortnight I have been manifesting, I have felt my confidence about my creativity grow. Just setting the intention to work on my book has led to a renewed sense of enthusiasm that has nudged away fear at its possible failure. The boost in confidence and focus has also worked for Doyle. She spent the past 18 months writing and self-publishing a children’s book and has met a new partner. “I wasn’t open to meeting a boyfriend, but manifesting helped me believe that there would be someone out there for me,” she says. “We soon met online and now we’re having a baby in August. It’s perfect.” Whether her recent gains have been down to luck, manifestation or a combination of both, Doyle sees no downsides to continuing to envisage a better future for her new family. “If something makes you feel happier and you’re not harming others, why not continue?” she says. “Since I’ve been manifesting, my life has completely turned around and I don’t think I’ll stop.” I have not been so successful; I have received no responses to my flurry of book emails. Visualising has been fun and helped me to realise that I can hope for more from my life (as well as realising that tweed is not my look), but I can’t help feel uneasy at a practice that appears so insular and self-centred. I worry that if I continue with this laser-like focus, I will lose sight of the other, more fleeting, joys of life: laughing with loved ones, dancing drunkenly, reading for its own sake and simply living. Perhaps we can be happy with these things, rather than always chasing our own goals. Only time will tell if my manifestation bears fruit – and I am not ready to give up completely.

2/3/2022,"Companies handed a combined £1.3bn in controversial fast-track Covid contracts with minimal scrutiny also claimed at least £1m in furlough grants, it can be revealed. Analysis of the accounts of companies that won lucrative emergency contracts to supply personal protective equipment (PPE) to the NHS during the height of the pandemic shows 12 also claimed funds to put staff on furlough at taxpayers’ expense.  Many had no prior history of supplying PPE but received huge boosts in revenue after securing deals to supply items ranging from gowns to masks. Overall the scramble to obtain PPE resulted in the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spending £9bn on personal protective equipment that was either substandard, defective, past its use-by date or dramatically overpriced. These furlough claims were legal under the terms of the £70bn job preservation scheme, but the revelations raise questions about the ethics of claiming taxpayer support while reaping windfall gains from lucrative state contracts. All 12 companies that claimed furlough grants had won PPE contracts via a so-called VIP lane, where approvals were fast-tracked often after a recommendation by ministers and government officials. The government spent £5bn on VIP lane contracts with 47 companies, but its use of the lane was found unlawful by the high court in last month. The London-based fashion brand Skinnydip, which built its reputation selling designer mobile phone cases, secured a £13m contract to supply PPE in May 2020 after a referral by the former Conservative party chairman Lord Feldman. That pushed it from a £1m loss in 2019 to a year of “record profitability” in 2020. It posted profits of £4.5m from revenues of £38m, more than double the previous year’s turnover, according to its annual report. The company, which had 15 retail stores as of 2019, also claimed at least £500,000 in furlough grants in 2020 to ensure “that our retail colleagues, whose place of work was closed for much of the year, continued to receive a monthly income, albeit at 80% of normal salary”. HMRC records show that Skinnydip’s furlough claims continued until at least last August. Other companies received contracts in 2020 that were worth several times their revenue for the whole of the previous year. Monarch Acoustics, a small, family-run furniture company based in Nottingham, claimed more than £200,000 in furlough grants. It won a PPE contract worth £29m – almost three times its total revenue in 2019 – after the former health secretary Matt Hancock referred it into the VIP fast lane. The result was a 4,700% jump in pre-tax profits, from less than £300,000 to £12.6m in 2020. The company continued to make furlough claims into 2021, receiving a further £25,000 to £70,000 between January and March. It is not possible to give the exact amount of furlough payments because they are reported in ranges by HMRC. Some of the companies that received both contracts and grants employ just a handful of people. Aventis Solutions is a Manchester-based recruitment firm that furloughed one of its three employees after winning an £18.5m contract to supply PPE via the high-priority channel. The firm’s director, Jamie Farrell, said the employee was a recruiter whose job was no longer needed after the pandemic shut down the recruitment side of the business, which had previously supplied non-clinical staff to the NHS, among others. He said: “Aventis Solutions Ltd has been a trusted supplier of the NHS for nine years and, during that time, has supplied PPE and other safety equipment on many occasions prior to the contract awarded by the Department of Health and Social Care. “At a time of unprecedented global demand and when the NHS was critically short of vital PPE equipment, our company was able to provide medical-grade masks from trusted suppliers and deliver within 14 days. “This was done at substantial financial risk to us, both as a business and personally to our company directors. There was no downpayment required from the DHSC, and at our own cost Aventis Solutions procured additional testing of all products, by an independent testing house, before delivery. “We are proud to have assisted the NHS in this way, and to have played this small part in the UK’s response to the Covid crisis.” Farrell added that Aventis’s prior PPE and safety equipment contracts, which numbered at least 20, had been with NHS hospital trusts, NHS provider organisations and clinical commissioning groups. Margaret Hodge, Labour MP and a former chair of the public accounts committee, said: “On top of the scandalous way in which our taxes were spent to give contracts to chums and allies, it is astonishing that companies that had benefited from this rigged system had the gall to claim more of our money through the furlough scheme. “The whole point of the furlough scheme was to rescue companies from bankruptcy and protect jobs, not to protect companies who had already profited massively at the taxpayer’s expense. “This whole saga demonstrates the absurdity of Boris Johnson’s claim that he successfully managed the pandemic.” A government spokesperson said: “Furlough provided a lifeline to more than a million businesses across the UK and protected nearly 12 million jobs – with businesses passing all the money they received from the scheme on to employees. “We also took swift and decisive action to secure PPE to protect health and social care staff. All contracts underwent rigorous financial, commercial, legal and policy assessment.” For some furlough-claiming companies, assessing the impact of Covid contracts on their finances is complicated by opaque corporate structures. Unispace Global Limited, a UK subsidiary of the Australian office designer Unispace, was identified by the National Audit Office as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the government’s emergency Covid scheme, having received £680m in PPE contracts after referral to the VIP lane. The company went on to claim up to £20,000 in furlough grants in March and April 2021. However, despite DHSC contracts that show Unispace Global’s address and company number, the £680m has not appeared in the company’s revenue figures, which declined from £88m in 2019 to £64m in 2020. A spokesperson for Unispace Global referred the Guardian to another company, Santé Group (formerly Unispace Health), saying: “Unispace cannot comment on this matter, as ownership has changed and the firm is no longer affiliated with Unispace Health in any way. Unispace, not including Unispace Health or Santé, was acquired by the private equity firm PAG in February 2021.” Santé Group is a network of at least four companies belonging to the brothers Gareth and James Hales, the founders and former majority shareholders of Unispace. All were incorporated after the start of the pandemic. Skinnydip, Monarch and Santé did not respond to requests for comment. A government spokesperson said: “The government contracted with Unispace Global Ltd for the procurement of PPE and all products ordered were delivered.”",News/UK news,Firms handed £1.3bn in Covid contracts claimed £1bn in furlough grants,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/03/dozen-uk-companies-given-vip-covid-ppe-contracts-also-claimed-furlough-grants
2/3/2022,"Rooks and jackdaws come and go with the night, rising and falling in black skeins over the house. They arrive at dusk, with a rush of wings beating the air, and leave before dawn, clattering and cawing. They roost during darkness in the crest of a nearby wood. Numbers have slowly increased since November and there must be nearly 1,000 birds there now. It’s easy to tell the two species apart by both appearance and sound. Adult rooks have a bald, greyish-white patch at the base of their large bills, which makes them look like medieval plague doctors wearing beaked masks. Jackdaws are smaller and have a distinctive silvery sheen over the back of their heads and necks, as if wearing a scarf. Close up, you can see their pearly eyes: unsettlingly pale with stark, seed-black pupils. Their calls are different: Jackdaws make a sharp “tchak”, like woodblocks being struck smartly together, while rooks have a salty-soft rasping cry.  During the day, they split into foraging parties and spread out over the vale, picking over the fields for insects or the first green blades of corn. The jackdaws have an exasperating tendency to pull straw off thatched roofs in search of hibernating beetles. As evening falls, raucous gangs gather in the big oaks beside the road. When the trees are full, the birds take flight to the wood, leaving their perches free for the next incoming group. This process of aggregation lasts about 40 minutes, although there are always some latecomers who skip the tree collections and fly low and fast direct to the roost. Once in the wood, they will rise up in a cloud and swirl above the trees, voices clamouring, before the final settling. The mixed roost is a winter arrangement and there are already signs that it is beginning to break up. Jackdaw pairs are already investigating nest sites away from the wood and the rooks are drifting back to the rookery trees. The rooks will lay their eggs this month and the jackdaws towards the end of March. They won’t start congregating this way again until the dark nights return in the autumn.
