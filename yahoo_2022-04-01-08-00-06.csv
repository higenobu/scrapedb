4/1/2022,"By Oleksandr Kozhukhar LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) -Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday said the situation in the south and the Donbas region remained extremely difficult and reiterated that Russia was building up forces near the besieged city of Mariupol. And in a rare sign of internal dissent, Zelenskiy also said in a video address that he had sacked two senior members of the national security service on the grounds they were traitors. Zelenskiy, who often uses colourful imagery, said the Russians were so evil and so keen on destruction that they seemed to be from another world, ""monsters who burn and plunder, who attack and are bent on murder"". Russia says it is carrying out a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbour. Moscow also denies Kyiv's accusations that Russian forces are targeting civilians. Zelenskiy said Ukrainian forces had pushed back the Russians from Kyiv and Chernihiv - two cities Moscow had announced would no longer be the focus of attacks as they seek to secure the separatist Donbas and Luhansk regions in the south-east. ""There will be battles ahead. We still need to go down a very difficult path to get everything we want,"" he said. ""The situation in the south and in the Donbas remains extremely difficult."" Zelenskiy also said he had fired two top officials at the national security service - the overall head of internal security as well as the head of the agency's branch in the Kherson region. ""I do not have time to deal with all the traitors, but they will gradually all be punished,"" he said, adding that the two men had betrayed their oath to defend Ukraine. He did not give specific details. The occasion marked the first time Zelenskiy has announced high-profile sackings of those involved in Ukraine's defence.

4/1/2022,"""Blue Zones"" are places in the world where people live the longest, healthiest lives. People in those regions tend to have similar diets, with few processed foods or added sugars. Experts suggest there are health benefits to limiting foods like red meat, refined grains, and sweets. To live a long, healthy life, it may be worth cutting back on foods like processed meat, sweets, and soda, evidence suggests. These foods are limited in so-called Blue Zones, regions where residents tend to live longer and have fewer health problems as they age, researchers discovered. Blue Zones vary geographically and by cuisine, spanning Greece and Italy as well as Costa Rica and Japan, but share common patterns of eating. Whole, plant-based foods like leafy veggies, fruits, beans, and grains are pervasive in Blue Zones. In contrast, the regional diets tend to avoid processed foods, refined grains, sweet drinks, and added sugar, and incorporate red meat and animal fats like butter sparingly, if at all. Limiting these foods may be linked to longevity and lower risk of chronic illnesses like heart disease, cancer, and more. Processed foods, from snacks to pre-packaged meals, take a back seat to whole foods From Costa Rica to Japan, one unifying trait of Blue Zones diets is that they rely primarily on whole, unprocessed foods. Staples like rice, beans, and veggies take precedence over pre-made and convenience foods, which are full of added fat, salt, sugar, and preservatives. Ultra-processed foods like pizza, chips, and the like have been linked to increased risk of early death from illnesses like heart disease or cancer. It can be challenging to eliminate all processed foods from your diet, since they include everything from condiments and sauces to flavored yogurt and granola bars. If you can't cut back completely, aim for healthier processed foods with nutrients like fiber and protein, according to experts. Added sugars, in everything from snacks to sauces, are limited One of the dietary culprits sabotaging longevity is too much sugar, evidence suggests. Sugar is ubiquitous in processed foods. While you'd expect foods like cookies, candy, and ice cream to be sugary, condiments and other pre-packaged meal ingredients are surprising sources of sugar. Too much of the sweet stuff can lead to weight gain, mood problems, skin conditions, and higher risk of diabetes, liver disease, and heart disease. Instead of sugary treats, Blue Zones residents tend to snack on foods like nuts, packed with fiber and healthy fats, or reach for nutritious fruits for some natural sweetness. Refined grains like white bread, pasta, and pastries are avoided in favor of high-fiber whole grains Blue Zones diets are famously high in carbohydrates, but with an important caveat: they favor whole grains over the refined, white, floury counterparts popular in the standard American diet. When a grain is processed, nutrients like fiber, vitamins, and minerals are stripped out to create a fluffier texture and a longer shelf life. Often, additives like fats and sugar are mixed in to improve flavor, too. As a result, foods like white bread, pasta, pizza dough, and pastries provide calories but few other nutritional benefits, and may be detrimental to heart health. The lack of fiber in refined grains also makes them less satiating than whole grains, making you more likely to overindulge and/or experience spikes in blood sugar. Red meat, especially processed meats like sausage, are eaten in moderation. Blue Zones diets are almost entirely plant-based, according to researcher Dan Buettner, which may in part explain their longevity benefits. Studies have shown people who eat more meat tend to have higher rates of heart disease and other chronic illnesses. The link between meat and health risks is observational, which means the research doesn't directly show eating more meat leads to worse health. And red meat may be a healthier alternative to processed meat, which is more closely linked to cancer, some evidence suggests However, many experts and studies still suggest eating red meat in moderation, if at all. Instead of meat, Blue Zones tend to incorporate high-protein foods like beans, seeds, fish, some dairy, and eggs into their diet in moderation. Sweetened beverages, including diet drinks, aren't as popular as water, coffee, and tea Sugary beverages like soda, juice, energy drinks, and the like are one of the most prevalent sources of added sugar in the standard American diet. High consumption is linked to greater risk of cancer and other illness. While some people have switched to diet sodas to avoid added sugar, and artificial sweeteners like aspartame have become more popular, experts say these alternatives aren't much better for your health. Some evidence has linked the sweeteners to higher risk of cancer and heart disease, as well as stronger cravings and less sensitivity to sweet tastes. People who live in Blue Zones' stick to water, or other unsweetened beverages. Coffee and tea have additional health benefits thanks to a wealth of antioxidants, micronutrients linked to lower risk of disease. For a little indulgence, some Blue Zones diets include red wine with meals, small amounts of which have minimal risks and potential benefits. Animal fats are often swapped out for olive oil Since Blue Zone diets are mostly plant-based, they tend to rely heavily on olive oil and similar sources of fat. There's good evidence these unsaturated fats can help lower cholesterol and improve heart health, compared to saturated fats from animal products. Some research has found swapping out butter for olive oil may stave off a range of health issues, including cancer, heart disease, and neurodegenerative disease. However, evidence also suggests butter is likely harmless in small amounts, so you may not need to cut out butter entirely — experts say it's fine to include it and other saturated fat sources in moderation, particularly from high-quality sources.

4/1/2022,"Police carrying out a welfare check on a home in east Texas were horrified to find skeletal remains being kept casually in the kitchen of a home owned by David McMichael. McMichael, 67, said the remains were those of his son Jason, who had died some four earlier in May 2018. Police did not say how old the son would have been when he died, if in fact the remains are proven to be his. Police say they were carrying out the check after a neighbor expressed concern for the son. In a press release, they say when they asked the elder McMichael if he knew why they were there, he said it was because of the corpse. “He was asked by officers on the scene if he knew why they were there,” the press release says. “Mr. McMichael advised them it was because he had a body in his kitchen.” McMichael was booked on charges of abusing a corpse. The remains were taken to the Southwestern Institute of Forensic Sciences in Dallas to determine if the person, identified so far only as a male, had been murdered or died of some other unfortunate incident. New Boston police, who are leading the investigation, say they are now interviewing relatives about the matter and that they do not have a missing-persons report about the man’s son.

4/1/2022,"(Reuters) - The head of France's military intelligence agency has quit over a failure to predict the war in Ukraine, several media outlets reported on Thursday, citing unidentified sources and an internal email announcing his departure. The Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Eric Vidaud had led the military intelligence agency for seven months but sources told the l'Opinion newspaper and other media that the army had judged his briefings ""insufficient"" and he lacked ""mastery of the subjects"". The chief of staff of France's armed forces, Thierry Burkhard, had told Le Monde this month that French intelligence had, unlike their U.S. counterpart, failed to predict Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""The Americans said the Russians were going to attack, they were right. Our services rather thought that invading Ukraine would have a monstrous cost and that the Russians had other options,"" Burkhard told Le Monde https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2022/03/06/guerre-en-ukraine-le-rouleau-compresseur-russe-risque-de-finir-par-passer-selon-le-chef-d-etat-major-des-armees_6116336_3210.html. L'Opinion said Vidaud was told on Tuesday that he would have to leave his post in the summer because of the misses over Ukraine and that he decided to step down immediately.
