1/6/2022,"Laura Ingraham’s latest bombastic attack on President Joe Biden prompted the same one-word reply from many Twitter users; projection. On Wednesday night, the Fox News personality suggested Biden’s presidency was in the pocket of rival network MSNBC. “This isn’t the Biden administration, though. Is it really? It’s the MSNBC administration,” she declared. Critics thought Ingraham’s claim was especially rich given the Donald Trump White House’s close ties to her widely watched conservative network. Only last month, it emerged Ingraham and fellow prime-timer Sean Hannity texted with then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows during the deadly U.S. Capitol riot, urging him to get Trump to call off his supporters who’d stormed the building. Fox personalities frequently defended Trump’s indefensible actions on the air throughout his presidency, with Hannity even joining the one-term POTUS on stage at a rally. Multiple Trump allies have since joined the network, among them former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

1/6/2022,"Like many Americans his age, 23-year-old Chandler Halderson spent the past year or so living at home with his parents. His father, Bart Halderson, and his mother, Krista Halderson, believed he was working remotely for a Wisconsin insurance company while finishing up his community college coursework from his room, according to authorities. His life appeared poised to head in a more promising direction, especially after Halderson announced in June 2021 that he’d been hired by Elon Musk’s SpaceX and would be moving to Florida later that month. His girlfriend planned to go with him. He told her he’d already rented an apartment and bought a car. The problem, authorities say, is none of it was true. According to prosecutors, Halderson was hanging out in his room playing video games all day, waking up early for meetings that didn’t exist so that his accountant father — who was also working remotely during the Covid-19 pandemic — would not suspect the ruse. Then, when Bart discovered the truth about his son’s fake life, prosecutors say Halderson shot him to death, and killed his mother when she arrived home a few hours later. He then dismembered their bodies, scattered their remains around Southern Wisconsin, and reported them missing almost a week later. Halderson is now on trial in Dane County for his parents’ murders, as well as charges of mutilating a corpse, hiding a corpse, and providing false information about a missing person.

The defense says he didn’t do it, and described him in their opening statement as “a normal kid” who enjoyed video games, playing with his dogs, and spending time with his girlfriend. Public Defender Catherine Dorl seemed to confirm that Halderson lied about his jobs and schooling, but suggested the deception was not a motive for murder. “​​You’re also gonna not know how Bart and Krista would’ve reacted to these lies,” she said, referring to the state’s case. “That’s never going to be explained to you, how lying turns into murder.” She also said it was even possible that Halderson will be convicted of some of the lesser charges he faces. “But what evidence do you have of murder?” she said. In the prosecution’s opening statements on Tuesday, Dane County Deputy District Attorney William Brown said Halderson “spun an amazing web of lies” trying to prop up his claims that he was holding down a job and studying renewable energy engineering, when in truth he’d flunked out after about one semester. He fabricated dozens of email exchanges between himself and college administrators and even posed as an adviser on a call with his dad, using a burner phone he’d purchased. When his accountant father would ask him why he wasn’t getting paid by his employer of almost a year, he made up excuses about errors in his salary and direct deposit information, eventually creating a fake paper trail of emails with HR to show his dad.  With pressure mounting from his father to pay rent, Brown said Halderson doubled down on his lie. “The best way out of your pretend job is an even more pretend job,” Brown said. “He’s gonna be an astronaut.” He told his family and his girlfriend he’d been hired by Space X. He and his girlfriend made plans to move to Florida together.  Then, Brown claimed, lacking a current or future job, a pending degree, or any money to make the move to Florida, Halderson stalled. Prosecutors allege he faked a head injury, saying he’d fallen down the stairs and suffered a terrible concussion — which Brown said a doctor will refute on the stand — along with spinal damage and nerve damage that put him in a neck brace and rendered him unable to travel.  Around the same time, Halderson’s dad Bart allegedly finally placed a call to Madison Area Technical College asking questions about his son’s transcript and discovered that none of the administrators Halderson had supposedly been emailing existed. “That’ll be it then,” Bart said on the recorded customer service call. Brown said Bart’s calendar showed that on Jul. 1, 2021, he and Halderson were scheduled to go MATC for a meeting, a meeting the prosecution contends must have been fake. That afternoon, Bart texted Halderson, “I’m ready whenever you are.” It was Bart’s last recorded communication. Brown claimed that rather than going to the college for the nonexistent meeting, Halderson had shot his father with a rifle, and killed his mother a short while later when she returned home, dismembered their bodies, tried to burn them in their home fireplace, and then scattered their remains on public land, farms, along rivers, in ditches, and in trash cans.  Brown previewed some of the evidence that he said will prove Halderson’s involvement. Investigators found remains of a human skull in the Haldersons’ fireplace. The owner of Halderson’s girlfriend’s family farm said he’d come by acting strangely after Jul. 1: he asked if he could swim in their pool, but they soon spotted him out in their field with the hatch of his car open. That’s where police later discovered Bart’s torso, along with saw blades, scissors, tree loppers, and a tarp covered with Bart’s and Krista’s blood. Brown also said cops found the murder weapon, an SKS rifle given to Halderson by one of his online friends, in the barn on the property. The morning after Halderson allegedly killed his parents, he told his girlfriend he was doing chores, but she captured a screenshot of his location in a wooded area by the Wisconsin River, thinking it was unusual. Police went there and found Krista’s disembodied legs. In the early evening of Jul. 1, after allegedly murdering his parents, Halderson wrote a list using the Notes app on his phone. It included hydrogen peroxide, lemon, and the directives: “clean floor” and “get a job.” Best of Rolling Stone 5 Festivals That Ended in Disaster Muhammad Ali: 4 Ways He Changed America The United States of Weed",U.S./Rolling Stone,Man Allegedly Fabricated SpaceX Job Offer Then Dismembered Parents When They Discovered His ‘Web of Lies’,https://news.yahoo.com/man-allegedly-fabricated-spacex-job-204845676.html
1/6/2022,"It took barely 24 hours after he gleefully announced he had been allowed to enter the Australian Open by the back door for Novak Djokovic’s plan to do so to unravel in spectacular fashion. Just a day after his chance to win a record 21st grand slam looked to have been rescued, it was on the brink of being wrecked after he was dramatically denied entry to Australia and told he was being deported. Djokovic was already aboard a 14-hour flight from Dubai to Melbourne when the first report emerged of an “issue” with his Australian Travel Declaration that would plunge the defence of his title into fresh doubt. That issue – a failure to apply for the correct visa that saw him detained at Melbourne Airport – emerged amid growing outrage at the decision to grant the world No 1 a “medical exemption” to allow him to play at the year’s first grand slam. An exemption from having to be vaccinated against coronavirus to enter a country with some of the strictest rules of any nation when it comes to combating the disease, one in which an unprecedented regime of lockdowns has been inflicted on its citizens. The decision to grant Djokovic such an exemption was said to have been taken following what Tennis Australia proclaimed had been “a rigorous review process involving two separate independent panels of medical experts”. But so fierce was the backlash against permitting someone who has become one of the faces of the anti-vaxx movement to benefit from rules designed for those genuinely unable to help being unjabbed – with no indication given whether his case fit into the latter category – the country’s political leaders wasted no time threatening to intervene. In a statement entitled, “Australia’s border rules apply to everyone,” federal home affairs minister Karen Andrews said: “While the Victorian Government and Tennis Australia may permit a non-vaccinated player to compete in the Australian Open, it is the Commonwealth Government that will enforce our requirements at the Australian border.” Prime minister Scott Morrison went even further, warning Djokovic he would be “on the next plane home” if he could not prove he had a genuine medical exemption. Morrison added: “There should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic at all. None whatsoever.” The Serbian’s case was not helped by mounting speculation his exemption had been granted based on rules designed to apply to those to have recovered from Covid-19 in the previous six months rather than on a medical condition being jabbed would risk compounding. Questions were also raised after Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley told Australia’s The Today Show Djokovic had been subject to a “blind review” (one where those deciding his fate would have done so using anonymised information) but later said “a conversation” had taken place between the player and panellists before a decision was made. All this put Djokovic – who has previously refused to reveal his vaccination status but has made it clear he opposes compulsory inoculation – under major pressure to disclose the criteria under which he had been granted an exemption. Tennis legend Rod Laver told the Herald Sun it would be in Djokovic’s “best interests to own up”, adding: “If he’s got a reason for [the exemption] then ... we should know it. “Yes, you’re a great player and you’ve performed and won so many tournaments, so, it can’t be physical. So what is the problem?” Laver also warned Djokovic he could face open hostility from the Australian Open crowd. “I think it might get ugly,” Laver said. “I would think the Victorian people would be thinking, ‘Yes, I would love to see him play and compete but at the same time, there’s a right way and a wrong way’.” Another former Australian player, Sam Groth, accused Djokovic of “laughing in the face of Victorians”, branding it a “brazen move” for the 20-time grand slam winner to announce his exemption on social media without offering a more detailed explanation. Groth, currently in isolation after testing positive for Covid-19, added in a column for News Corp: “He was here last year lifting the trophy and paying tribute to what Victorians in particular had endured. He played in empty stadiums during the snap lockdown. His announcement on Tuesday was tone-deaf. He should know better.” News of Djokovic’s detention came amid claims his visa “issue” related to a failure to apply for the correct one for those entering Australia unvaccinated and questions over whether he had adequate documentation to prove the reason for his exemption. He was questioned for hours by Australian Border Force (ABF) officials, with his father, Srdjan, telling Serbian radio station B92 his son was being held isolated in a room. He later told Australian breakfast show Sunrise: “They are holding my son captive. If they don’t release him in the next half an hour, we will fight them on the street.” In what was fast becoming a major diplomatic incident, Serbian president Aleksandar Vucic said his country was doing “everything to see that the harassment of Novak Djokovic is brought to an end immediately”. Soon after, Australian health minister Greg Hunt confirmed Djokovic’s visa had been cancelled, while the ABF said in a statement: “The ABF can confirm that Mr Djokovic failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia, and his visa has been subsequently cancelled. “Non-citizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa cancelled will be detained and removed from Australia.”",World/The Telegraph,"Publicly rebuked, held in isolation and denied entry - Novak Djokovic's Australian Open dream unravels",https://news.yahoo.com/novak-djokovics-world-turned-upside-222134266.html
