5/8/2022,"Despite the Federal Reserve's increasingly hawkish stance, inflation continues to be a problem. In March, U.S. consumer prices rose 8.5% from a year ago, marking the biggest jump since 1981. Inflation erodes purchasing power. According to Shark Tank star and investment mogul Kevin O’Leary, that means keeping large sums of money in a low-interest savings account is a big mistake. “Right now in a bank account, you’re getting very little [interest],” he says in a recent interview with CNBC. “And inflation is over 6%. So you’re actually losing money every 12 months.” O’Leary suggests having three months of salary on hand in case of emergency. But after you've built that cushion, O’Leary recommends investing in index funds, which offer an easy and diversified way to get exposure to the stock market. Here’s a look at three index funds. Each of them focuses on different chunks of the market — own all three and you’re well diversified.

Several funds track the S&P 500 in order to provide investors with convenient exposure to U.S. equities. But if a fund wants to use the S&P 500 name, it has to pay a licensing fee that essentially gets passed on to investors. The Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index Fund closely mirrors the performance of the S&P 500. But it’s not an “official” S&P 500 copycat, so it doesn’t have to pay the licensing fee. In turn, FNILX boasts an expense ratio of 0%. Every dollar you put into FNILX gets put to work. Small-cap stocks don’t get as much attention as their large-cap counterparts. But investors shouldn't ignore them. The largest companies we see today were once small. Companies with plenty of room to grow have tremendous upside. For a low-cost way to invest in this growth-oriented group, investors can check out Vanguard Small-Cap ETF. It tracks the CRSP U.S. Small Cap Index, which measures companies in the bottom 2%-15% of the investable universe. VB is diversified, holding around 1,550 stocks. It also has a low expense ratio of just 0.05%. One thing to keep in mind: Because small-cap stocks are relatively young, they tend to be more volatile than more established large-cap names. To truly diversify your portfolio — especially in this age of globalization — having some exposure outside of the U.S. is essential. Thankfully, it’s easy these days to invest overseas. For instance, Vanguard Total International Stock ETF seeks to match the performance of the FTSE Global All Cap ex-US Index. By owning this index fund, investors get broad exposure across developed, as well as emerging non-U.S. equity markets. The fund’s top holdings include global industry titans such as Samsung Electronics, Nestle, Tencent Holdings and Toyota. It also owns smaller names and holds over 7,800 stocks, with an expense ratio of 0.07%. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms.

5/8/2022,"The Chinese ambassador to the US has called on Chinese-Americans to help to improve US-China relations, which he said were ""going through serious difficulties"". Speaking at a reception hosted by the Committee of 100, a group of elite Chinese-Americans in business, government, academia and the arts, Qin Gang also pledged support to combat anti-Asian hate. The comments by Qin came as the US is celebrating Asian-American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month in May, and as hate crimes targeting Asian-American communities have surged sharply, partly driven by anti-China political rhetoric and misinformation about the Covid-19 pandemic.

According to a recent poll by the non-profit Leading Asian Americans to Unite for Change and The Asian American Foundation, at least 21 per cent of US adults now say Asian-Americans are at least partly responsible for Covid-19, up from 11 per cent in 2021. Meanwhile 33 per cent believed that ""Asian-Americans are more loyal to their country of origin than to the United States"" - up from 20 per cent last year. Qin admitted that bilateral relations between China and the US faced serious difficulties, but said Chinese-Americans could play a role because ""the China-US relationship concerns not only the future of the world, but also the welfare of Chinese-Americans"", according to a transcript published by the Chinese embassy on Saturday. ""China is regarded as the most serious competitor and even 'national security threat No 1' of the US. With various kinds of misunderstandings, misperceptions and misjudgments going on, the risks of confrontation and conflict are on the rise,"" he said.

Photo: Xinhua> ""Just as an old Chinese saying goes, 'No egg stays unbroken when the nest is overturned'. Chinese-Americans are US citizens with natural ties to China,"" Qin continued. ""I hope that you can help build China-US friendship, advance exchanges and cooperation, bridge differences and ease confrontation. Ultimately, Chinese-Americans can only prosper when the China-US relationship enjoys sound and stable development."" Qin's audience included Gary Locke, a former US ambassador to China and chairman of the Committee of 100, and Huang Zhengyu, a prominent businessman and former White House Fellow. Qin said that amid the rise of pandemic-fuelled racism, Asian-American communities should be united, to ""get more engaged in politics, get more integrated into American society, and better protect your legitimate rights and interests"", adding that the Chinese embassy would also work with Chinese-American communities to stop anti-Asian hate. Americans of Asian origin, who make up 7 per cent of the US population, are one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the US but are increasingly targeted by anti-Asian hate crimes, which were up by 339 per cent in 2021 compared with the year before, according to a study by the California State University Santa Barbara's Centre for the Study of Hate and Extremism in February. Fears peaked in March last year after eight people, six of them Asian women, were killed in a mass shooting in a spa in the Atlanta area. In March, hundreds of people lined up for pepper spray in Manhattan's Chinatown following the death of Michelle Alyssa Go, a 40-year-old Asian-American woman who was pushed into the path of an oncoming subway train.
