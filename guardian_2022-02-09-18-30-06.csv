2/9/2022,"Merger talks between mutual insurer LV= and Royal London have broken down. It is the second time within two months that a deal to buy the 178-year-old firm, originally known as Liverpool Victoria, has collapsed.  LV=’s members blocked a planned takeover by US private equity firm Bain Capital in December, when they rejected the year-long campaign by the company’s board to secure backing for its preferred bidder. LV= began discussions with its fellow mutual Royal London at the start of the year. However, the company said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange that it had “become clear to LV= that our different mutual models mean such a merger would not be in the best interests of LV= members”. Seamus Creedon, LV=’s interim chair, said: “The strength of LV=’s business performance over the past 18 months combined with its operational progress has strengthened the board’s belief in, and commitment to, the continuation of our status as an independent mutual.” Creedon said LV= had heard what its members had said “about the importance of mutuality and the continuation of the LV= brand”. The company said it had a strong capital position, was trading well and would update its members on its business strategy “shortly”. LV=’s announcement that talks had ended came just days after a boardroom clear-out, following the failure of the mutual’s management to gain member approval for the controversial sale of the company to Bain Capital for £530m. Members rejected the deal, which would have ended LV=’s member-owned status. The company said on Monday its chairman Alan Cook – who had come in for heavy criticism over the demutualisation plan – would step down, replaced on an interim basis by Creedon, a non-executive director at the firm. Three other directors will also leave, although LV=’s chief executive Mark Hartigan remains in place. Royal London had had its sights on a tie-up with LV= for some time, after LV=’s management chose to proceed with talks with Bain instead, and even proposed an “early three-way discussion” between Royal London, Bain and LV=, if it looked like LV= members would reject the Bain deal. In the event, Royal London waited in the wings while the LV= and Bain drama played out. It put forward an unsolicited offer for LV= in December, which was rejected, but then entered talks with its fellow mutual in the new year. Barry O’Dwyer, group chief executive of Royal London, said: “Our offer to preserve LV=’s mutuality through a merger with Royal London was based on an understanding that LV= did not have a viable future as an independent company. “For Royal London’s customers and members, nothing changes.” Royal London said it planned to share “a substantial level of profits” with its eligible customers in April, as it usually does.",News/Business,Merger talks between LV= and Royal London collapse,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/09/merger-talks-between-lv-and-royal-london-collapse

2/9/2022,"Scott Morrison has goaded Labor into an election contest over character, after the opposition questioned the prime minister’s trustworthiness in the wake of a series of damaging text messages. Morrison, who has faced a torrid start to the parliamentary year overshadowed by questions about his character, was challenged in question time on Wednesday about a text message sent by the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, and a separate text exchange between a Liberal minister and the former New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian.  Joyce’s message to former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins branded Morrison as a “liar” and a “hypocrite”, while Berejiklian allegedly called the prime minister a “horrible person” and questioned his focus on political point scoring during the bushfires in 2019-20. Also on Wednesday, Labor’s deputy leader, Richard Marles, asked Joyce to confirm he had served with Morrison for 15 years in parliament including six in the cabinet, and therefore “knows what he’s talking about, doesn’t he?” Joyce, who publicly apologised for the text message and offered Morrison his resignation, said he had a good working relationship with the prime minister, listing their cooperation “defending the nation”, building dams and inland rail, and dealing with “one of the greatest pandemics of modern times”. “Our working relationship has made sure we have kept this nation safe,” Joyce said. The Labor MP for the seat of Eden-Monaro, Kristy McBain, seized on the text exchange with Berejiklian and an unknown Liberal minister, with one message sent while fires ravaged her electorate in southern NSW. According to the leaked text messages, the former NSW premier allegedly said of Morrison: “Lives are at stake and he is obsessed with petty political point-scoring.” “Why was the prime minister obsessed with political point-scoring during the bushfires and why didn’t he just do his job?” McBain asked. The manager of government business, Peter Dutton, attempted to disallow the question, saying it was based on “an unsubstantiated media gossip speculation piece”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “This is not a document that can be referred to, or a statement that can be referred to, and certainly it is not within the prime minister’s responsibility to respond to gossip, and it should be ruled out of order on that basis,” Dutton said. However, the new speaker, Andrew Wallace, ruled the question in order. Morrison sought to downplay the message, saying Berejiklian “did not confirm any such statement at all”. “This is what we have become used to from the opposition in putting these matters forward. It’s not about policy,” Morrison said. “If the leader of the opposition wants to have a character contest with me, bring it on.” The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, sought to return fire on the Labor leader, despite a ruling from the speaker that a question about “alternative approaches” did not allow “carte blanche to undertake a gratuitous character assessment”. Frydenberg said the “biggest risk to the economic recovery” underway in Australia was the leader of the opposition, and attacked Albanese’s record supporting various tax policies while in government. “Somebody who has never held a treasury portfolio, somebody who attacks tax cuts for families as being for the top end of town … and a leader of the Labor party too weak to stand up to the unions and the Greens,” Frydenberg said. The increasingly personal attacks in parliament come as the Guardian Essential poll shows the Coalition lagging behind Labor 46% to 47%, with 8% of people undecided. Morrison’s approval ratings have plummeted over the past year, but he is still narrowly seen as the preferred prime minister over Albanese. Speaking to the coalition party room on Tuesday, Morrison urged unity on the proposed religious discrimination bill in the lead-up to the election, appealing for MPs to “come together”.“I’m going to lead, and I’m asking you once again to follow me to an election victory,” Morrison said. Albanese said on Tuesday the Coalition did “not deserve a second decade in office”. “I know they’re distracted by their internal hatreds and feuds, [but] the problem isn’t that. The problem is that because of that, their distractions, their dishonesty and their disunity is stopping them looking after the interests of Australians.”",News/Australia news,‘Bring it on’: Scott Morrison goads Labor into election character contest after questions over leaked texts,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/09/bring-it-on-scott-morrison-goads-labor-into-election-character-contest-after-questions-over-leaked-texts
2/9/2022,"Grace Tame and Brittany Higgins wield considerable cultural power. When the National Press Club agreed to host the duo for a joint address on Wednesday, there was a stampede for tickets. The event was a sellout. Tame, the former Australian of the Year and survivor advocate, and Higgins, the Liberal staffer who triggered parliament’s #MeToo reckoning, did not mince words. Here are some key highlights.  Tame, who fought for the right to tell her own story, knows how to hold the attention of a room. On Wednesday, she revealed she had received a “threatening” phone call from a “senior member” of a government-funded organisation who asked her not to reflect negatively on the prime minister “with an election coming soon”. In the context of Tame being roasted for giving the prime minister, Scott Morrison, some robust side eye at a function at the Lodge in January, this anecdote was quite the mic drop. Wednesday’s claim triggered an immediate investigation by the government, and a statement from Morrison’s office that the prime minister would not (and had not) authorised any intervention of that nature. Journalists, being journalists, wanted more information. Tame didn’t intend to elaborate. In response to the inevitable who, what, when, where inquiries, she said: “I reckon if I was willing to name either, I would have put them in the speech.” Can you tell us what you said back to that person? “Nope. Doesn’t matter now, does it?” Tame and Higgins fielded a number of questions about whether they planned to enter politics, or enter the election campaign fray. The answer was no. Higgins said in tribal terms she was “stateless”. Tame said the former Labor leader Kim Beazley “did try to sway me”. At one point, she also winked at the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, who was watching on in the audience. But it was still no. She said: “I feel like I can achieve more change outside of politics”. Tame was asked whether she could nominate some things that Albanese could do better, “and what would it mean if Australians chose to vote Scott Morrison back in?” Tame waited for half a beat before returning serve. “All Anthony would have to do is none of the things that Scott’s done.” Higgins spoke of her determination to drive change. She referenced the public rallies last year – women marching for justice around the country. “Last year wasn’t a march for acknowledgment,” Higgins said. “It wasn’t a march for coverage. It wasn’t a march for language. It was a march for justice. And that justice demands real change in our laws, as well as in our language, in our national culture, as well as our national conversation. That starts with the prime minister – yes, some of his language last year was shocking and, at times, admittedly, a bit offensive. But his words wouldn’t matter if his actions had measured up. Then, or since.” Higgins said that Morrison’s comments after her allegation of sexual assault became public last year, that his wife had encouraged him to think about his own daughters, were misplaced. “I didn’t want his sympathy as a father. I wanted him to use his power as prime minister. I wanted him to wield the weight of his office and drive change in the party and our parliament, and out into the country. And one year later, I don’t care if the government has improved the way that they talk about these issues. I’m not interested in words any more. I want to see action.” On Tuesday, the presiding officers and political leaders acknowledged the pain of many former political staffers subjected to bullying, harassment, and worse. Given she had been the catalyst for that parliamentary apology, how did Higgins feel when that moment ultimately came? “It was deeply emotional in the way that I wasn’t anticipating and I think being in that room, kind of, made all the difference … It made it so much more tangible to not see these people as, you know, flattened characters on a TV screen like I have watched most of this year play out.” During a question about whether cultures with consequences made people safer, one journalist referenced a question she’d previously asked Morrison about what had done to make parliament safer today than it was 12 months ago. Tame’s brow furrowed. “I do love the part where you asked the prime minister if he thought it was a safer workplace. You know, because he’s about six foot three in my understanding, he’s built like a – you know! Probably a bit safer for him.” Higgins has been the catalyst for reform of the toxic workplace culture in Parliament House but as she asked on Wednesday – what about the rest of the country? Higgins noted the government was following the advice of Australia’s sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, when it came to workplace reform in the parliament. But the government had ignored Jenkins’ advice to impose a positive duty on employers to keep their employees safe from sexual harassment. “I’m shocked that that was not more of a flashpoint moment for people,” Higgins said. Imposing a positive duty “would have impacted every single working woman in the country, and we just kind of let that moment slide by without thinking”. Higgins also took aim at the national plan to reduce violence against women – at one point holding a direct eye-line with the Liberal ministers who were its architects. “The national plan doesn’t aim low,” she said. “Unfortunately, its aims are so lofty and vague that it’s impossible to disagree with and equally difficult to examine … But the question is – how will they be achieved? “That is, unfortunately, where the draft plan has lost its way. Instead, it is largely a collection of statistics describing the problem, filled with warm sentiments and platitudes attached to noble outcomes which lacks the promised learnings from the past decade towards a future free from violence against women and children, and clear targets to that end. Without clearer action and firm targets, there can be no accountability.” Tame and Higgins were asked about the current parliamentary debate about religious discrimination. Was enough being done to protect the rights of LGBTQ+ students? Tame was short and sharp. “No,” she said. “Why does one group of people have more of a right to be themselves than another – that’s what I have to ask the government.” Higgins was worried about the well being of young people. “I can’t even imagine how they’d be feeling having to listen to all this play out right now.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Tame gave a sharp summary of what it is like to be commodified by the media; what it’s like to have your objectives lost in translation. “Certain members of the [media] have consistently labelled me as politically divisive, failing to mention that I spent most of last year having frank, productive meetings with politicians on all sides at both the state and federal level. So, after a year of being re-victimised, commodified, objectified, sensationalised, delegitimise, gaslit, thrown under the bus by the biased mainstream media – despite my inclusive messaging – I would like to take this opportunity to take a glass of water, and remind you that I really have nothing to lose.”",News/Australia news,Grace Tame and Brittany Higgins: nine key moments from the sellout press club event ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/09/grace-tame-and-brittany-higgins-nine-key-moments-from-the-sellout-press-club-event
2/9/2022,"The spy agency Asio has warned more “angry and alienated Australians” could turn to violence after being exposed to “an echo chamber” of extremist messaging, misinformation and conspiracy theories during the coronavirus pandemic. The Asio boss, Mike Burgess, said on Wednesday the pandemic had sent online radicalisation “into overdrive” and he noted a “deeply distressing” trend of children – some as young as 13 – being radicalised online and in school.  “As a nation, we need to reflect on why some teenagers are hanging Nazi flags and portraits of the Christchurch killer on their bedroom walls and why others are sharing beheading videos,” Burgess said in a speech on Wednesday night. In his annual threat assessment speech in Canberra, Burgess also disclosed that Asio had “recently detected and disrupted a foreign interference plot in the lead-up to an election in Australia”. He said the nation needed to be on guard against foreign interference in 2022 given a federal poll was looming – and he said foreign spies were attempting to cultivate government employees via social media. Burgess said during the Covid pandemic isolated individuals spent more time online where they were “exposed to extremist messaging, misinformation and conspiracy theories” without some of the circuit breakers of everyday life. “In some cases, it accelerated extremists’ progression on the radicalisation pathway towards violence,” he said. Burgess said Asio had produced an assessment in 2007 warning that a future pandemic would result in increased anti-government behaviour. “We have certainly seen that with Covid. While Asio’s overall terrorism caseload has decreased since this time last year, there’s been a distinct increase in radicalisation and specific-issue grievances,” he said. “Some Australians believe the government’s approach to vaccinations and lockdowns infringed their freedoms. And in a small number of cases, grievance turned to violence.” Burgess said examples were “the violent incidents at Covid-related protests fuelled by anti-vaccination, anti-lockdown and anti-government agendas”. “We have also seen threats against public office holders, an attack on a vaccination clinic, and several physical assaults on healthcare workers. We assess that these tensions and the associated possibility of violence will persist.” While lockdowns and mandatory quarantine requirements were being eased, the Asio chief said, vaccination requirements for some types of work and travel would “continue to drive anger, uncertainty and fear within a small section of society”. This group viewed the restrictions “as an attack on their rights, the creation of a two-tier society and confirmation of their perceived persecution”. Burgess said his intelligence agency “does not have any issue with people who have opinions they want to express” – as that was a critical part of a vibrant democracy – but its concern was “where opinions tip into the promotion of violence, or actual acts of violence”. He stressed the vast majority of people who chose not to be vaccinated would not engage in violence and the vast majority of protestors were not violent extremists, but he added: “Asio’s focus is on a small number of angry and alienated Australians.” Burgess last year dumped terms like rightwing extremism and Islamic extremism in favour of new umbrella categories “ideologically motivated violent extremism” and “religiously motivated violent extremism”. Burgess said on Wednesday the behaviours in response to Covid lockdowns and vaccinations were “not specifically left or rightwing” but rather “a cocktail of views, fears, frustrations and conspiracies”. Individuals who were willing to support violence in this context were “best and most accurately described as ideologically motivated violent extremists”. “Some of the alleged violent acts at the recent Old Parliament House protest are a case in point,” he said. “The individuals involved were driven by a diverse range of grievances, including anti-vaccination agendas, conspiracy theories and anti-government sovereign citizen beliefs.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Burgess said Asio expected to “see more of this behaviour in Australia in the medium term” with protests driven by diverse specific-issue grievances to be part of the security environment for the foreseeable future. “In some cases, protesters will advocate the use of violence, and in a smaller number of cases, they may use violence,” he said. Many of the actors were “newcomers” so it was harder for Asio to “get a sense of what is simply big talk – and what is genuine planning for violence”. He said the most likely terrorist attack scenario in Australia over the next 12 months continued to be a lone-actor attack. While Asio did not believe the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan had increased the immediate terrorist threat to Australia, the agency was concerned that in the longer term violent extremists “from our region” may travel there for militant training. Alarmingly, Burgess said, the number of under-18s being radicalised was increasing. He said children as young as 13 were embracing extremism, both religiously and ideologically motivated. “At the end of last year, on average, minors represented more than half of our priority counter-terrorism investigations each week.” He said Asio and law enforcement were not the answer to stopping teenage radicalisation – “we do not belong in the classroom” – and urged parents, schools, clubs and community leaders to step in early if children were acting out of character. Burgess was vague when describing the target of a recently disrupted foreign interference plot in the lead-up to “an election” in Australia. He would not identify which jurisdiction “because we are seeing attempts at foreign interference at all levels of government, in all states and territories”. But Burgess said the case “involved a wealthy individual who maintained direct and deep connections with a foreign government and its intelligence agencies”. The goal, he said, was “secretly shaping the jurisdiction’s political scene to benefit the foreign power”. “The puppeteer hired a person to enable foreign interference operations and used an offshore bank account to provide hundreds of thousands of dollars for operating expenses,” Burgess said.

Burgess said the puppeteer and the employee “plotted ways of advancing the candidates’ political prospects through generous support, placing favourable stories in foreign language news platforms and providing other forms of assistance”. He said the political candidates had no knowledge of the plot. Asio intervened because of the “deliberate deceit and secrecy about the foreign government connection” and ensured “the plan was not executed and harm was avoided”.",News/Australia news,‘Violent extremists’: Asio boss warns of ‘angry and isolated’ Australians radicalised during pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/09/violent-extremists-asio-boss-warns-of-angry-and-isolated-australians-radicalised-during-pandemic

2/9/2022,"Never mind new animals: Ella Baxter’s debut novel looks at first to be a very familiar creature. Main character Amelia (surname Aurelia, a piece of whimsy explained by her taking her stepdad’s surname) is one of those fictional young women who lives in between the morbid and the erotic. She has outrageous sex to swallow her ineffable sadness, and though she’s from Australia rather than Ireland, she could have stepped from the pages of a Sally Rooney novel. When we first meet her, she’s in bed with a man she barely knows: “We both watched patiently as he prodded my vagina with his hangnailed finger, and we took turns sighing mid-thrust.” She cajoles him into growling “I will ruin you” at her during intercourse, and after he has reluctantly provided satisfaction, she kicks him out and starts arranging her next hookup. In the morning, she’s ready for her job as a mortuary makeup artist, painting the dead into a simulation of their living selves.  The sex is, she tells us, a salve for some injury: “Most nights I find myself trying to combine with someone else to become this two-headed thing with flailing limbs, chomping teeth and tangled hair. This new animal. I am medicated by another body.” We learn that her stepbrother recently killed himself. And then her mother dies too – suddenly, accidentally, while Amelia is out having weird sex with another stranger. Amelia decides she cannot attend her mother’s funeral and, without informing either her brother or stepfather, does a flit to Tasmania, where her birth father is. And what would she do here apart from seek more obliterating sex? “I’m going to have a wonderfully shocking time,” she announces, though the “wonderful” part fails to emerge. She goes to a fetish club with a self-confessed sadist, and when being bullwhipped on a stage doesn’t resolve her “particular mother-shaped wound”, she tries being a domme instead, disastrously. Both these interludes are written with unsparing bathos. Amelia dispassionately observes a group in the kink club “engaging in what looks like sexual parkour”. “Do you love this?” she demands of the unfortunate sub on the receiving end of her debut domming performance. “It’s all right,” he says, noncommittally, having been peed on. Baxter finds bleak comedy in these settings, and uses Amelia’s adventures to explore the strange landscape of 21st-century sexuality: a world where any sex you want is available at a sanitised swipe, where the comfort of another body comes at the end of a cold negotiation, where “consent” and “control” are safety rails that could fall away any second. “This is my choice,” she tells her sadist through gritted teeth, only goading him to hurt her more. It’s hard, though, to reconcile Amelia’s innocence in her BDSM encounters with the person we know her to be in her hookups. Surely a young woman who chews through men and their boundaries the way we see her doing at the start would have at least a passing acquaintance with the mores of the fetish world? And it seems unlikely that someone who makes multiple pickups a night would have never encountered at least one honest-to-goodness danger before the bullwhipper. If her naivety seems excessive, so does her exposure to mortality. The death of her stepbrother is strangely superfluous, seemingly introduced only to forewarn us that Amelia applies promiscuity to her traumas the way a firefighter applies an axe to a burning building. Her job seems all too much like a convenient way to facilitate this sort of commentary: “The deceased are beyond beautiful, but only because they are so empty of worry.” It’s as though Baxter doesn’t quite have confidence in her own creation, and so loads up the backstory. It’s an unnecessary worry. Amelia makes sense on her own terms, as a young woman negotiating the sexual settlement. Baxter is a sharp observer, and seems to have the Didion knack of getting close to a subject without surrendering her scepticism. New Animal is a little unformed – if Amelia’s art is a metaphor for the novel, then the blusher still needs some blending – but there’s a winning talent here.

2/9/2022,"It is a cold January morning and mist hangs over Windermere like a thick wool blanket. The lake looks to be asleep. The researchers that have gathered on its shores to sample the water peer into the distance and decide that visibility is too poor to take the boat out today. Unpredictable weather is one reason lake ecology during the winter has been poorly studied until recently. Dr Stephen Thackeray, a lake ecologist at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH) and project leader of the Cumbrian Lakes Monitoring Platform, says there also used to be a preconception that not much was happening during the colder months.  “For a long time, it was assumed that it was just a really quiet time with muted ecological activity. But studies over the past 10 years have shown that actually there’s more going on than we originally thought.” A lot of attention has been paid to how rising temperatures are bringing forward the start of spring – a phenomenon known as “season creep” – and its resulting “phenological asynchrony”, which puts animal and plant species out of sync with others on which they rely. However, the length and temperatures of the winter period are also ecologically important. Growers know that some trees need a certain number of “chill hours” for flowers, fruit and nuts to form properly, for example, while freezing temperatures can curb the spread of particular diseases. Less is known about what happens during winter in freshwater ecosystems, which are fragile and contain many imperilled species, and how they are being affected by the climate crisis. That is something that the UKCEH researchers want to rectify. Every fortnight they go out to monitor four lake basins in the Lake District – north and south Windermere, Esthwaite Water and Blelham Tarn. On Windermere, they carry out the work in a boat named after John Lund, who started observing the lake in 1945 because he was interested in the seasonal growth of algae. “I think it’s fascinating that you start gathering data about these places for a reason, without realising that sustained monitoring will allow you to answer different questions later on,” says Thackeray. “John was really interested in the dynamics of a particular group of algae called diatoms. But to understand how the algae grow and the lake generally is changing, we also have to look at the physics, the chemistry, [and] different components of the food web.” Although they cannot visit their usual sampling sites today, Dr Glenn Rhodes, a microbial ecologist, and field instrument technician Gareth McShane demonstrate the specialised tools for examining the lake. They drop a probe to measure water temperature at different depths and lower a white disc until it can no longer be seen to gauge how deep light can penetrate. Water samples will be sent off to test the acidity, concentrations of oxygen and nutrients, and the volume of phytoplankton and zooplankton. Rhodes pours a seemingly clear sample of water into a plastic bottle, which on closer inspection is seen to have tiny creatures wriggling around in it, among them crustaceans such as Cyclops and Eudiaptomus that graze on algae. “It’s appreciated more and more that important things happen in the winter, that organisms aren’t all completely inactive,” says Thackeray. “Many species do have dormant stages and slow down when it’s cold but they still have populations that tick over through the winter months. So as those conditions become warmer, those populations can develop more rapidly earlier in the year.” Helped by Lund’s long-term records, these observations are building up a detailed picture of how the lake is changing. Winter temperatures have risen more on average than those during the rest of the year, and the summer starts earlier and finishes later. Rising temperatures can influence water temperature, boost algal growth and cause fish to spawn earlier. How the layers of water of different temperatures mix is also changing, so that they are settling down, or becoming physically “stable”, earlier in the year, which can have far-reaching effects on a lake’s ecology. “The really important thing is that all these species are changing in different ways, and they all depend on and interact with each other. So changes in the lake early in the year have a kind of memory effect that passes through the subsequent seasons. And the knock-on effects are at different timescales for different species,” says Thackeray. These climate-related impacts are compounded by local environmental stresses that affect most of the UK’s freshwater ecosystems, such as sewage pollution and agricultural runoff. Extreme weather events, such as storms or floods, also have an impact by mixing up the layers of water. “The increase in extreme events due to climate change has the potential to erode the stable water structure of the lake. The water at the bottom is colder, it has a different chemistry, and it can get pushed down the lake. It’s a big growth area in our area of research.” In colder countries, research is being done into declining ice cover, which has a significant impact on how lakes function. One paper described lake ice as “one of the world’s resources most threatened by climate change”. This kind of work presents considerable logistical, methodological and safety challenges, but lake researchers are increasingly using tools such as satellite imagery and environmental DNA to develop their understanding of what happens over the year. There will always be a role for getting out on the water and gathering data, says Thackeray, but the possibilities are huge. As we walk around Windermere’s shores, I wonder what the lake might look like in January several years from now. “At the moment we cannot say with total confidence what future freshwater winters would look like,” says Thackeray. “However, we are already seeing evidence of winter-time cyanobacteria [blue-green algae] scums … and further warming could make such events more likely. “Furthermore, the progressive loss of cold winter conditions could negatively impact coldwater fish species like Arctic char. Their eggs are particularly sensitive to water temperature and do not survive well under warmer conditions.” Does it matter? “It’s a really complex picture. You can argue that the lake has value in itself but ecological processes can also influence things like water quality.
