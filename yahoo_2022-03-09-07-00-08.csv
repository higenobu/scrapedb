3/9/2022,"Russian forces in Ukraine have been ‘hacked’ after abandoning their own secure encrypted phone system, according to investigative journalism organisation Bellingcat. The switch to insecure messaging meant that a conversation revealing the death of Major General Vitaly Gerasimov - chief of staff of the 41st Army - was able to be intercepted by Ukrainian intelligence. Russian soldiers have switched off their encrypted phone system after towers were destroyed and are using normal phones with local sim cards, according to Bellingcat, an open-source investigative journalism organisation. Bellingcat’s executive director, Christo Grozev, said in a series of Tweets: ‘The idiots tried to use the Era cryptophones in Kharkiv, after destroying many 3g cell towers and also replacing others with stingrays. Era needs 3g/4g to communicate.’ ‘In the phone call in which the FSB officer assigned to the 41st Army reports the death to his boss in Tula, he says they've lost all secure communications. Thus the phone call using a local sim card. Thus the intercept.’ Read more: Russia says military action will stop immediately if Ukraine agrees to four conditions Bellingcat specialises in uncovering information on events such as the Salisbury poisonings and events in Syria by analysing large data sets.

Grozev said ""In the call, you hear the Ukraine-based FSB officer ask his boss if he can talk via the secure Era system. The boss says Era is not working. ""Era is a super expensive cryptophone system that they introduced in 2021 with great fanfare. It guaranteed work “in all conditions”."" Bellingcat also claims to have identified the officer on the call: Dmitry Shevchenko, a senior officer in the FSB. The claims have yet to be independently verified. Throughout the conflict, groups have claimed to have intercepted Russian communications, due to units relying on walkie-talkie radios and smartphones. British intelligence company Shadowbreak claimed to have intercepted messages which showed that Russian troops were demoralised and had ‘deliberately punched holes’ in vehicle fuel tanks to avoid reaching the front line, the Telegraph reported.

But Russian forces are believed to be generally trying to keep mobile phone connections and internet working. Speaking to Politico, James Lewis, senior vice president and director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies told Politico: ""If they can do localised shutdowns of telecommunications, they’ll do it. But in general, they’ll want to keep the phones working in Kyiv because they can listen in."" It’s also possible that Russian forces have left Ukrainian commercial networks operating as they are relying on them to communicate, Politico suggested.

3/9/2022,"Japanese scientists have started investigating the mysterious “mermaid mummy” that has long been an object of worship at a temple in Okayama Prefecture.

A team of researchers from the Kurashiki University of Science and the Arts are conducting scientific analyses of the mummified remains of the mysterious icon to determine what they are actually composed of.

The “mermaid mummy,” which measures around 1 foot, has earned its name for having an upper body that appears to be human and a lower body that looks like a fish tail.

The 300-year-old mummy, which has retained its nails, teeth and hair over the years, has also maintained the eerie expression of a screaming child.

Kozen Kuida, the chief priest at Enjuin temple in the city of Asakuchi, took out the artifact from the wooden box where it has been stored inside the school’s veterinary hospital for an examination on Feb. 2.

“We have worshiped it, hoping that it would help alleviate the coronavirus pandemic even if only slightly,” the head priest was quoted by Asahi Shimbun as saying. “I hope the research project can leave (scientific) records for future generations.”

According to Kuida, the mummy had been put on display for public viewing about 40 years ago, but it was recently stored in a fireproof safe so it won’t deteriorate.

A note inside the box claims that the mysterious creature was caught in a fishing net on the coast of Tosa Province (now Kochi Prefecture) between 1736 and 1741. The mummy was passed on to other owners after the turn of the Meiji Era (1868-1912) and ended up being acquired by the Enjuin temple.

The remains are to be studied from a variety of academic perspectives. Hiroshi Kinoshita, a 54-year-old board member of the Okayama Folklore Society, will study the mummy from the viewpoint of folklore studies, while Takafumi Kato, a 54-year-old paleontology professor, will conduct morphology analysis on the upper body of the artifact. Meanwhile, an associate professor that specializes in ichthyology will study the fish-like lower body, and an associate professor with expertise in molecular biology will do the DNA analysis.

The researchers are set to release their findings in fall of this year.

3/9/2022,"WARSAW (Reuters) -Poland is ready to deploy all its MIG-29 jets to Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the United States, and urges other NATO members that own planes of that type to do the same, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday. U.S. lawmakers pushed President Joe Biden's administration on Monday to facilitate the transfer of fighter aircraft to Ukraine from Poland as well as other NATO and Eastern European countries, after a plea on Saturday from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. ""The authorities of the Republic of Poland ... are ready to deploy – immediately and free of charge – all their MIG-29 jets to the Ramstein Air Base and place them at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America,"" the ministry said. ""At the same time, Poland requests the United States to provide us with used aircraft with corresponding operational capabilities. Poland is ready to immediately establish the conditions of purchase of the planes,"" it said in a statement. Ukraine's military already flies Russian-made aircraft, making them the best choice for Ukrainian pilots who already know how to operate them, experts say. Combat pilot training on U.S.-made aircraft can take years and requires a different pipeline for maintenance. In neighbouring Slovakia, Defence Minister Jaroslav Nad reiterated the country's general aim was to replace Russian military equipment, including MiG-29 fighter jets, but said the country was not yet ready for such as step. ""At the moment, we don't have a replacement for the MiGs, but we are doing everything to speed up the processes,"" Nad said in a statement released after he spoke by phone with U.S. Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin. Poland is supporting Kyiv with defensive weapons, but has said it would not send jets to Ukraine, as it is not a direct party to the conflict between Ukraine - which is not a NATO ally - and Russia. ""...any decisions on delivering offensive weapons have to be taken by the entire NATO and on a unanimous basis,"" Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Tuesday during a joint news conference with his Norwegian counterpart in Oslo. ""This is why we are ready to give all of our fleet of jet fighters to Ramstein, but we are not ready to make any moves on our own because, as I said, we are not party to this war,"" he added.

3/9/2022,"The Ukrainian defense ministry has released audio from a call that it claims captured two Russian officers lamenting the death of a top general and the collapse of its secure communications network in Ukraine. In the call—which has been verified by Bellingcat, the fact-checking group known for exposing Kremlin misinformation—two purported Russian FSB officers are heard discussing the death of a general killed in fighting near Kharkiv, which has been hammered by shelling this month. Ukraine’s defense ministry named the general as Vitaly Gerasimov, chief of staff of the 41st Army, and Bellingcat reported that it had confirmed the death with Russian sources. In its statement, Ukraine’s defense intelligence agency said Gerasimov had been “liquidated” alongside “a number of senior Russian army officers” in fighting near Kharkiv. If Gerasimov’s death is confirmed, he would be the second Russian general to be killed in Ukraine within a week following the death of the 41st Army’s deputy commander, Andrei Sukhovetsky. A pro-Putin Chechnyan general, Magomed Tushayev, was also reported to have been killed. Russia’s failure to protect its top-ranking officers backs up reports from Ukraine that the Kremlin’s invasion force is in disarray. On the call released by the Ukrainian defense ministry, one FSB officer can be heard complaining that its encrypted comms system had been destroyed, allowing Ukrainian forces to listen in on Russian military orders. Bellingcat’s executive director, Christo Grozev, wrote, “In the phone call in which the FSB officer assigned to the 41st Army reports the death to his boss in Tula, he says they’ve lost all secure communications. Thus the phone call using a local sim card. Thus the intercept.” Grozev went on: “His boss, who makes a looong pause when he hears the news of Gerassimov’s death (before swearing), is Dmitry Shevchenko, a senior FSB officer from Tula. We identified him by searching for his phone (published by Ukrainian military Intel) in open source lookup apps... In the call, you hear the Ukraine-based FSB officer ask his boss if he can talk via the secure Era system. The boss says Era is not working.” Grozen reported that Russia’s crypto phones may no longer work in Kharkiv because Russian forces had destroyed surrounding cell phone towers, and Russia’s encrypted comms system operates using 3G or 4G. The statement released by Ukraine’s military intelligence agency alluded to severe communications problems among Russian forces, saying, “The data obtained also indicate significant problems with communication in the occupier’s army and with the evacuation of their broken units.” Russia has not commented on reports of Gerasimov’s death.

3/9/2022,"By Chayut Setboonsarng and Panarat Thepgumpanat BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thousands of tourists from Russia are currently stranded in Thailand, officials said on Tuesday, as unprecedented Western sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine put a squeeze on Russians struggling to find flights and finances. Flight cancellations, a rouble currency in free-fall and payment problems from Russian banks being cut off from the global SWIFT system has left more than 7,000 Russians in limbo in locations like Phuket, Koh Samui, Pattaya and Krabi, Thailand's tourism authority chief said. ""We have to be good hosts and take care of everybody,"" Yuthasak Supasorn told Reuters. ""There are still Russian tourists on their way here,"" he added. Russia's embassy in Bangkok did not immediately respond to request for comment on its citizens. In 2019, Thailand received 1.4 million Russian visitors. In January, it counted about 23,000 Russians, representing about a fifth of the total arrivals. About half of those stranded were on the island of Phuket. ""We've asked hotels to reduce prices and extend their stays,"" Phuket's tourism association president Bhummikitti Ruktaengam said. Some visitors, when able, had used China's UnionPay after cards issued by Russian banks using U.S. payment firms Visa and Mastercard stopped working, he said. Visa and Mastercard announced on Saturday they were suspending operations in Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Russia has called its actions there a ""special operation"". Though Thailand was among 141 countries that backed a United Nations resolution calling for the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops, it has not imposed any sanctions on Moscow. Bhummikitti said hundreds of people from Ukraine were also stranded, mainly due to airport closures there. He said efforts were being made to get stranded Russians onto flights to Moscow on Middle Eastern airlines and to arrange repatriation flights. A proposal was being considered to allow the use of cryptocurrency for payments at hotels, flights and other businesses in Phuket, he said.

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below."" Blood type doesn’t affect much in our daily lives. In fact, most people don’t even know whether they’re Type A, B, AB, or O. But the seemingly-banal detail might be a factor in who comes under the thumb of 2020’s world-wide tyrant—that is, coronavirus. A new study in the journal PLOS Genetics revealed that people with Type A blood are more likely to have a severe case of Covid-19. A previous study in the journal Blood Advances from 2020 also affirmed this research, adding that people with Type O blood seem to be more protected from Covid-19. Researchers in China first shared this idea back in March 2020, and the findings were echoed by a paper out of Columbia University a month later. Even DNA testing company 23andMe tapped their customers and found that among 750,000 people (by far the biggest study population yet) who were diagnosed and hospitalized for COVID-19, those with type O were more protected. Then, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine confirmed the idea with a peer-reviewed study: Folks with Type A blood were 45 percent more likely to become infected with COVID-19 than those with other blood types, while those with Type O were 35 percent less likely. ""It's pretty clear that Type O is protective to some degree. I don't think that having Type A or Type B is the problem—it's just that they don't have Type O,"" says Mark Udden, MD, professor of hematology and oncology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. So people with Type A may be more likely to catch the virus, but whether they also get it worse is still unclear: the NEJM study reports that people with Type A blood were also more likely to have respiratory failure. However, the research out of Columbia University found there wasn’t really any difference among intubations or death and different blood types. And a 2020 study in the Annals of Hematology looked specifically at the link between blood types and the need for intubation or death in confirmed COVID-19 patients. They found no link between blood type and the severity of the illness. The new research in Blood Advances, mentioned above, had similar findings. Although true to the unending questions around the disease, another, smaller study, also in Blood Advances, suggested that blood types A or AB had higher risk of certain intense interventions and longer ICU stays, but the researchers themselves considered the link to be so far “unresolved.” We don’t know why people with Type O might possibly be more protected—but there are a lot of theories. The most basic idea is that blood type might influence a person’s ability to fight the virus, says David Aronoff, M.D., director of the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. It may affect your immune system’s strength or your inflammatory response to the infection. Either way, that would color how likely you are to not only get the virus but also how strong your symptoms are, he explains. The NEJM paper, however, highlights the antibodies we produce depending on blood type. “If you’re type O, you naturally make antibodies against Type A and Type B,” Dr. Udden says. These Type A antibodies might make it more difficult for SARS-CoV-2 to attach to its receptor in Type O blood and multiply in the body, he explains. But there’s another interesting layer to a potential protective element in Type O blood: something called von Willebrand factor, which is a glycoprotein in charge of repairing damage to blood vessels by prompting your blood to clot. We know the COVID-19 virus damages the lining of your blood vessels. Your body then releases von Willebrand factor, or VWF, into your blood so it can fix the damage to the vessel walls. But VWF also encourages clotting. “In COVID-19 patients who die, we're seeing unusually high clotting issues, like strokes, kidney failure, and pulmonary embolisms—so we know there is a clotting problem that stems from the virus,” Dr. Udden says. A 2020 analysis in The Lancet found that compared to COVID-19 patients who weren’t in intensive care, those who were critically ill in the ICU and died had higher VWF antigens in their blood. And guess what: People with Type A blood have higher levels of VWF naturally than people with type O blood, Dr. Udden points out. In addition, people who are Black, who are dying at a disproportionately high rate from COVID-19, tend to have higher levels of VWF, too. Just because you’re Type O doesn’t mean you’re in the clear. All studies so far have only looked at blood type in connection to symptomatic cases of coronavirus, Dr. Aronoff points out. We don’t know about asymptomatic carriers—that is, Type O could still pass along the virus to other people unknowingly just as much as Type A could. ""There are two possibilities: You're Type O so you might not contract the virus because it has no landing strip—there's nothing to attach to,"" Dr. Udden explains. ""Or by being Type O, the virus gets in but the A antibody prevents it from docking with enough cells to cause disease. But the virus is still in your system and you can still pass it to someone else."" No. Blood type is actually a pretty weak player, Dr. Udden says. Socio-economic status is a big vulnerability—likely to need to work outside the home, in crowded buildings, and living in tighter quarters with more family members. Age and health are next in line for susceptibility. If you’re older or have an underlying disease like cancer, diabetes, or heart disease, you’re more likely to develop a severe case of coronavirus, Dr. Udden adds. Blood type is after all of these. People with Type O blood might be slightly more protected from the virus, and people with Type A slightly more vulnerable. But, as far as we know, everyone is still at risk of getting the virus, and definitely at risk of being an asymptomatic carrier—and therefore of spreading it to others. The discovery of Type O’s protective effect is crucial to building an understanding of how the virus works—especially considering there aren’t many other patterns it follows, Dr. Udden points out. But both docs agree it shouldn’t actually change anyone’s behavior. “I’m Type O, and I’m not going to go hang out in bars just because of this slight protective effect,” Dr. Udden says. “These findings shouldn’t change your behavior. Anyone can still get ill with SARS-CoV-2 and/or participate in the chain of transmission,” Dr. Aronoff adds. The bottom line is clear: The safest and most effective way to prevent from getting coronavirus or unknowingly spreading it to others is to keep wearing a mask, getting vaccinated, and socially distancing from people—regardless of your blood type.

3/9/2022,"By Essi Lehto HELSINKI (Reuters) - Hundreds of Russian passengers have filled up trains to Finland's capital Helsinki from Saint Petersburg every day since the war in Ukraine began and mutual airspace closures cut off flight connections between Russia and the European Union. The two trains on that route were almost empty before Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 but were now fully booked with 700 people arriving from Russia daily, Finland's public railway operator VR said. Hundreds more are driving to join lengthy queues at Finnish, Estonian or Latvian road border crossings as many Russians fearing a wider Russia-West conflict over Ukraine seek ways to leave the country. More than 2 million Ukrainians have so far fled the fighting in their country, most of them into neighbouring central and eastern European countries. [L2N2VB0W9] The EU has agreed to grant temporary residency to Ukrainian refugees but the status of Russians seeking extended stays in the bloc is unclear.

""We just came here because that seemed to be the only quick way to get out of Saint Petersburg,"" he told Reuters after stepping off the train. ""People who understand what is really going on are really upset and I have already heard about several of my friends and colleagues who have either already left or they are desperately trying to leave,"" he added, requesting Reuters not mention his last name. Before the trip, he and his wife spent several days trying to withdraw as much money as they could from their savings accounts as financial uncertainty caused by western sanctions sent Russians scrambling for cash and a possible way out of the crisis.

3/9/2022,"A father and daughter visiting Yellowstone National Park for the first time on Saturday enjoyed an exceedingly rare encounter with a wolverine in what their guide described as a once-in-a-lifetime experience. “For the rest of the tour, the 9-year-old daughter couldn’t stop saying, every 15 minutes or so, ‘Wow… we saw a wolverine today!’” MacNeil Lyons, owner of Yellowstone Insight, recalled to For The Win Outdoors. “She told me it was the most amazing day ever in her life.” Lyons captured several images of the elusive critter, which he shared via Facebook. In a Saturday post that included a photo showing the wolverine facing the group from the road, Lyons commented on the rarity of the encounter and added: “It was only 2-3 minutes, but it was as if time stood still. There was for sure a true and focused connection between two sentient beings.” On Sunday, Lyons detailed how he captured the images and said he and his Southern California clients “felt beyond elated at this chance encounter,” considering that the number of wolverines residing inside park boundaries might be a few as seven. (See Facebook post below.) Lyons did not disclose the location of the sighting, but explained that it occurred at 11:38 a.m. as he was rounding a corner. The wolverine, in the oncoming lane, was visible as a “low to-the-ground, dark animal loping away from us.” RELATED: Rare footage shows elusive Yellowstone National Park cougar One of his guests asked if it was a small bear, but Lyons quickly realized that what they were observing “was, indeed, a wolverine!” Perhaps the last time a documented wolverine sighting in Yellowstone National Park generated headlines was January 2021. The park shared video footage captured a month earlier by a motion-sensor trail camera and stated: “Last month, park biologists were excited to find one of Yellowstone’s rarest mammals triggered a remote trail camera outside the Mammoth Hot Springs area!” It was the first video footage of a wolverine captured by a trail camera inside the park. Wolverines, members of the weasel family, reside mostly in high-altitude alpine and forest habitat and can weigh as much as 30 pounds. They prey largely on small mammals and birds, and also eat vegetation. But wolverines can be ferocious and are capable of killing animals many times their size. Wolverines are mostly solitary except during breeding season.

3/9/2022,"CNN’s Anderson Cooper said a video from Russia that has gone viral amid the country’s invasion of Ukraine perfectly sums up the weakness of its president, Vladimir Putin. Appearing on Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show” live from Lviv, Ukraine, on Monday, Cooper recalled the footage of Russian riot police arresting a woman in her 80s for protesting the war with handmade signs on the street. “To me, it was the most incredible image because I thought Vladimir Putin, who likes to appear half-naked riding around on a horse or in his black belt doing judo as a tough guy, is scared of an 80-something-year-old woman who is simply standing on a street holding up a sign protesting a war,” Cooper said. He added that Russia’s new law criminalizing media reports that contradict the Kremlin’s version of events in Ukraine — including such videos and photos — was a “sign of weakness” and “fear” and “of the reality of the disinformation campaign that Russia wages.” Watch the interview here: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/9/2022,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine is 'not going particularly well' and the Kremlin is 'getting more desperate' as Vladimir Putin's troops feel 'let down' by their leaders, a minister has claimed. Western officials believe Putin had hoped to have Ukraine well under his control within days of launching the invasion, but say poor planning, bad leadership and a fierce line of resistance from the Ukrainian people have stalled the Russian progress. The US defence office has claimed Russia has deployed nearly all the 150,000 troops who were stationed on the border, but has only ""made little progress"". An unnamed official added the Russians are ""frustrated by a stiff Ukrainian resistance as well as their own internal challenges"". The nation's largest cities are still under Ukrainian control, but coming under constant Russian bombardment as Putin's force step-up their campaign of misery. Speaking to Sky News, UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said: ""Well it's not going particularly well for the Russians, it's day 13, way off their timetable.  Read more: Russia says military action will stop immediately if Ukraine agrees to four conditions Ben Wallace said Russian soldiers are dying on ""large scales"" and are getting more desperate in their tactics. ""On one level sadly there's lots of casualties, we've seen the indiscriminate shelling which has killed numerous civilians. ""We've also recognised that probably the biggest casualties so far in the war are Russian military soldiers who have been let down by appalling leaders, appalling leadership and appalling plans, and now you see them literally at large scales dying."" On Wednesday, Russia admitted for the first time admitted it had suffered heavy losses, saying in a statement 498 of its troops had died. The UK has said the death toll will be “considerably higher” than figures released by the Kremlin. Ukrainian officials have claimed over 9,000 Russian soldiers have died. The figure has not been independently verified.

A 40-mile-convoy of around 15,000 soldiers has been spotted outside of Kyiv for days now, but has stalled, reportedly due to supply issues. Wallace added: ""We've seen the column is still stuck north of Kyiv, there are reports overnight of Ukrainian special forces destroying over 20 Russian helicopters and I think we can see that Russia have a real logistic problem.

Russia's invasion has sparked the largest humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War Two. The UN's latest figures have say 2 million refugees have fled their homes and gone into neighbouring countries for safety. The capital of Kyiv and second-largest city of Kharkiv still remain under the control of the Ukrainians but have come under severe shelling from Russian forces. International attention has turned to the town of Irpin in recent days, after Putin's troops shelled humanitarian corridors which had opened up for people to evacuate. It comes after the Kremlin laid out four conditions which it demands for the war to come to an end.

3/9/2022,"Pfizer's CEO said he had a ""heated"" debate with Jared Kushner over COVID-19 vaccine supplies. Albert Bourla said he told Kushner the US would have to wait its turn to get 100 million more doses. He said Kushner disagreed, telling him the US government could ""take measures"" to enforce its will. Pfizer's CEO, Albert Bourla, said in a book excerpt published by Forbes on Monday that he and Jared Kushner, former President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, once had a ""heated"" debate over whether the US should receive additional COVID-19 vaccine doses first. Bourla said he and Kushner, who in the early days of the pandemic was the head of a COVID-19 shadow task force, disagreed over the timeline to supply the additional 100 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine that the Trump administration had ordered. Bourla wrote that the conflict arose because the US was topping up on its original order of 100 million doses, but other countries had already signed contracts with Pfizer to secure their vaccine doses. ""Jared was asking for a very aggressive delivery plan to the U.S. for the additional 100 million doses. He wanted it all in the second quarter of 2021,"" Bourla wrote. ""To do that, we would have had to take supplies from Canada, Japan, and Latin American countries, all of which had placed their orders earlier than the U.S. and were expecting the vaccine in the second quarter."" Bourla said the debate ""became heated"" when he refused. He said he reminded Kushner that he had made it clear to Moncef Slaoui, the chief advisor to the Trump team's vaccine-development program, that Pfizer would not take doses from other countries to give them to the US. However, Kushner ""didn't budge,"" Bourla said. ""In his mind, America was coming first no matter what. In my mind, fairness had to come first,"" Bourla wrote, adding, ""He reminded me that he represented the government, and they could 'take measures' to enforce their will."" Bourla wrote that he responded to Kushner: ""Be my guest, Jared. I prefer to have Japan's prime minister complaining to you about the cancellation of the Olympics rather than to me."" The CEO said the disagreement ended when Pfizer's manufacturing team told him its schedule would allow it to deliver the extra doses to the US without cutting the supply to other countries. ""Jared called me two days later from Mar-a-Lago to thank me for the collaboration, and we closed the loop on a happy note,"" Bourla wrote. The US and Pfizer struck a $2 billion deal for the additional 100 million vaccine doses — enough to fully inoculate 50 million Americans — in December 2020.

3/9/2022,"Tim Shanley, 32, from Sydney... and I am a product manager in the Superannuation industry
 I got married in late 2019 and was in relatively good shape. After coming back from my honeymoon my wife and I bought our first home together and I was on cloud nine. Then Covid hit in early 2020, and I started to work from home full-time. While I was still on a mental high, I was enjoying myself a little bit too much, and as a result my exercise and fitness regime took a back seat with gyms being closed, and so did my diet. I lost all structure and routine in my life and ended up over-eating, drinking too much alcohol, and pretty much stopped exercising. At my heaviest I tipped the scales at 113 kgs (249 pounds). I had lost all of my confidence, I was not feeling good about myself both mentally and physically, and I was starting to get concerned about my overall health and wellbeing from things such as elevated blood pressure, increased stress, trouble sleeping, and irritability. I was not happy, and was seeking joy artificially from comforts such as alcohol and food. Seeing myself in a photo from a wedding in late 2020 was my lightbulb moment. I didn’t like what I saw: I couldn’t accept the fact I had let myself go so much, and felt embarrassed. I realised I needed to make a change and make a change fast, so I reached out to the professionals to help me pull my finger out! I contacted Ultimate Performance in Sydney in late 2020 with the intention of starting 2021 fresh with a new mindset and with some big goals to get my life back on track. Not your usual ""diet and exercise"" story and we LOVE it! My program consisted of four workouts a week, two with my trainer and two by myself, which were a combination of full body high intensity, resistance training and heavy weight workouts. I also walked between a minimum of 15,000 to 20,000 steps a day every day. My program was 20 weeks long in total, and my target was to get down to 10 percent bodyfat. When I started the program, my thought process and attitude towards my diet completely changed and allowed me to take more accountability for what I was putting into my body and kept me honest. I started to watch what I was eating more closely though understanding macros, meal timing and nutrition. My trainer Saskia believed in me from day one. She gave me the motivation and encouragement needed to achieve my goals and equipped me with the tools to push myself to places I didn’t think I could go. She was very unselfish with her knowledge on health and fitness and was constantly feeding me information about how to train correctly, how to diet and understand nutrition, how to listen to my body and how to be confident and positive! I lost a total of 33 kgs (73 pounds) in 20 weeks and hit 10 percent body fat by the end of the journey which was one of my main goals. It was a long grind, but all worth it in the end and I couldn’t have been happier. The physical results speak for themselves, however it’s the things you can't see that I was more satisfied with, such as regaining my confidence, lowering blood pressure, improving my quality of sleep, and just having overall better and more consistent moods. Now I go to bed happy and wake up happy! You don’t need to have a background in strength training or weights to be able to achieve your health and fitness goals. I think it all comes down to attitude, discipline and commitment – if you have these three things, plus a positive mindset, most of the battle is already won. While the physical elements are tough, they are short lived, whereas the mental battle of sticking to a diet and routine is constant, but if you are able to hit small goals, your overall long term goals will be easier to achieve.

3/9/2022,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson on Tuesday rejected opposition calls to consider joining NATO following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying an application now would destabilize security in Europe. Sweden has not been in a war since 1814 and has built its foreign policy on non-participation in military alliances, but it has forged ever closer ties to NATO in recent years as tensions with Russia in the Baltic region have risen. Russia's invasion, which it calls a ""special military operation"", has renewed calls for Sweden to join NATO, alongside Finland, which has also remained outside the bloc. ""If Sweden were to choose to send in an application to join NATO in the current situation, it would further destabilize this area of Europe and increase tensions,"" Andersson told reporters. ""I have been clear during this whole time in saying that what is best for Sweden's security and for the security of this region of Europe is that the government has a long-term, consistent and predictable policy and that is my continued belief."" Russia does not want Finland or Sweden to join NATO and late last month, Moscow made its latest warning of ""serious military-political consequences"" if they did. Andersson was speaking after meeting opposition party leaders to discuss the worsening security situation. A poll on Friday by Demoskop and commissioned by Aftonbladet newspaper showed 51% of Swedes were in favour of NATO membership, up from 42% in January. People against joining fell to 27% from 37%. It's the first time such a poll has shown a majority in favour. Ulf Kristersson, the leader of the Moderates, called on the government to begin broad domestic political discussions about NATO membership, a debate that has already started in Finland. Finland and Sweden have close military ties and a move by one to join NATO would put added pressure on the other to apply. ""It is urgent,"" Kristersson told news agency TT. ""We can't get behind a wind-break and hope that it all blows over and then be surprised by a Finnish decision in a month or two.""

3/9/2022,"A Florida Highway Patrol trooper is home and recovering on Monday after she used her vehicle to block a rogue driver that was speeding towards a pedestrian event taking place on the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, the agency said in a news release. The driver, 52-year-old Kristen Kay Watts of Sarasota, bypassed an Interstate 275 closure and failed to stop for multiple law enforcement officers before the crash took place just after 8:45 a.m. Sunday. Watts was later arrested on charges of DUI, two counts of DUI with property damage and two counts of reckless driving involving injury and property damage. “The Florida Highway Patrol applauds the actions of Trooper Toni Schuck, a 26 year veteran of the patrol who, as the last line of defense to the Skyway 10K runners, placed herself in harm’s way to protect others,” the agency said in a news release Monday. Dashcam footage released by the agency on Monday shows the moment when Watts’ BMW sped past one FHP cruiser attempting to block her passage on northbound I-275. Her sedan then crashed nearly head-on into Schuck’s patrol SUV. Both Schuck and Watts were seriously injured in the crash, FHP said. This year’s Skyway 10K had 8,000 racers participating, organizers of the charity event said on Facebook. On Monday, organizers also shared a public thank you to Schuck. “On behalf of the Skyway 10K, we are beyond thankful for our law enforcement partners and the trooper who risked her life to keep our race participants safe,” the post says. Watts was listed as in custody at the Manatee County Jail on Monday afternoon. She was held in lieu of $52,000 bail.

3/9/2022,"Some Russian officials are reportedly unhappy about Putin's decision to invade Ukraine. Farida Rustamova, formerly of the BBC, spoke with Kremlin officials for a Tuesday story. An English translation of her article said many were ""discouraged, frightened."" President Vladimir Putin has alienated some top Russian officials since the early stages of the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian journalist Farida Rustamova reported. According to the journalist Ilya Lozovsky's English translation of Rustamova's Tuesday report, officials and members of parliament she spoke with said they were increasingly worried about how Putin was handling the war. ""In reality, the attitude toward the war within the corridors of power is ambiguous,"" Rustamova wrote, according to Lozovsky, whose translation she shared on Twitter and reposted in her Substack newsletter. ""I came to this conclusion after speaking with several members of parliament and officials at various levels. Many of them are discouraged, frightened, and are making apocalyptic forecasts."" Rustamova recently fled the country and previously worked for the BBC Russian Service — which has since been suspended by the London-based network — as well as Meduza and the RBC, an investigative outlet that experienced a mass resignation in 2016. ""No one is rejoicing,"" a source described as ""close to the Kremlin"" told Rustamova, according to Lozovsky's translation. ""Many understand that this is a mistake, but in the course of doing their duty they come up with explanations in order to somehow come to terms with it."" ""Some officials aren't associating themselves with what's happening at all, viewing Putin's decision as a historical choice over which they have no influence, and the meaning of which no one will understand for a some time to come,"" Rustamova wrote. Another person granted anonymity said Kremlin officials were ""carefully enunciating the word clusterfuck"" when describing the invasion. Rustamova wrote that every source she talked to believed Putin wouldn't follow through on invading Ukraine and was instead looking to gain leverage for concessions, such as declaring Donetsk and Luhansk ""people's republics."" ""Everyone had some scattered information that did not provide an answer to the main question: Will we start bombing or not?"" another person described as ""close to the Kremlin"" told Rustamova. The Russian reporter also outlined how Putin had been limiting information to a close circle of advisors. ""Most likely, my sources say, only the narrowest circle had been informed: Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, and the leaders of the counterintelligence service,"" she wrote, according to Lozovsky's translation. ""For example, the head of the presidential administration Anton Vaino, whose role, unlike his more influential predecessors, is more akin to a private secretary, is not informed about such decisions, my sources say."" A different person Rustamova described as ""a good acquaintance of Putin's"" said the Russian president's mood had gotten worse.

Doocy pressed her on fuel prices as he dismissed the widely held position that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has triggered the recent leap in costs — and instead blamed Biden administration policies. “There’s no question” the price hikes are a “direct result of the invasion of Ukraine,” Psaki responded. “Federal policies are not limiting the supplies of oil and gas,” she added. When Doocy interrupted her, Psaki fired back: “Peter, let me give you the facts here. I know that can be inconvenient, but I think they’re important in this moment.” Biden administration officials have been “clear” about the need for the U.S. oil supply to meet demand while also pushing for a shift to renewable energy sources, she said. Psaki pointed out that the U.S. is one of the world’s largest producers of oil and gas, noting that oil production in the nation is at “record numbers.” Meanwhile, there are “9,000 approved drilling permits that are not being used, so the suggestion that we are not allowing companies to drill is inaccurate,” Psaki added. “I would suggest you ask the oil companies why they’re not using those if there’s a desire to drill more.” Also on HuffPost This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/9/2022,"Barr called Rudy Giuliani's Four Seasons Total Landscaping press event ""a grotesque embarrassment."" Giuliani, Trump's former lawyer, promoted baseless election fraud claims at the event. Barr detailed his thoughts around the 2020 election in his new memoir released Tuesday. Former Attorney General William Barr wrote in his new memoir that the infamous November 2020 press conference hosted by President Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani in the parking lot of a small company called Four Seasons Total Landscaping was ""a grotesque embarrassment."" Barr shared his thoughts on the failed efforts by Trump's legal team to challenge the 2020 election results in his new book, ""One Damn Thing After Another,"" released on Tuesday. ""His legal team had a difficult case to make, and they made it as badly and unprofessionally as I could have imagined,"" Barr wrote, pointing to the ""bizarre"" Four Seasons Total Landscaping press conference on November 7 and the November 19 press event ""in which mascara appeared to drip from"" Giuliani's sideburns. ""It was all a grotesque embarrassment,"" Barr added. Four days after the 2020 presidential election, Giuliani promoted baseless voter fraud claims during a press conference at Four Seasons Total Landscaping, a small landscaping business in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Yet Giuliani's claims were drowned out by critics mocking the event venue, theorizing that Trump's legal team mistakenly booked the landscaping business instead of the luxury Four Seasons hotel. ""A gap soon developed between what Giuliani and his team were saying in public and what they were telling courts. In public, they aired sweeping but unsubstantiated assertions of voter fraud,"" Barr wrote. ""But in their court papers—as Giuliani frankly acknowledged—they were not claiming fraud."" Indeed, as the press briefing took place, major news networks projected then-Democratic nominee Joe Biden as the winner of the election, prompting an outcry from Giuliani. ""The call for Joe Biden isn't, isn't — who was it called by?"" Giuliani asked. A reporter replied that ""all"" the major cable news networks had announced that Biden was the expected winner. ""All of them! Oh my goodness! Wow, all the networks! We have to forget about the law, judges don't count!"" Giuliani responded sarcastically, throwing his arms in the air. Giuliani and other members of Trump's legal team continued to pursue efforts to overturn the results in several battleground states that Biden won, though they were unsuccessful. Federal, state, and local officials have repeatedly said there was no widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Barr made no secret of his disdain for Giuliani in his book, calling the former mayor ""an unguided missile."" The former AG described his frustration with how Giuliani tried to rope the Department of Justice into his schemes to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden's son Hunter in 2019 and then to back Trump's false claims of massive fraud in the 2020 election. ""Rudy Giuliani saved New York City after 9/11 and should go down as probably the most consequential mayor of a big city in American history,"" Barr wrote. ""But he will also go down as the man who helped President Trump get himself impeached—not once but, as it turned out, twice.""

3/9/2022,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - A superyacht linked to Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich left Barcelona on Tuesday where it had been undergoing repairs in a local shipyard, ship-tracking data showed. The 140-meter (460-foot) Solaris, which sails under a Bermuda flag according to monitoring site Marine Traffic, left Spanish company MB92's Barcelona shipyard just after 5 p.m. (1600 GMT) on Tuesday, according to the same site. MB92 declined to comment. The superyacht, which was built in a German shipyard and first took to the sea early last year, is one of a string of yachts owned by Abramovich, according to reports in luxury goods publications SuperYachtFan, SuperYacht Times and Forbes. Abramovich, who last week put Chelsea Football Club up for sale and promised to donate money from the proceeds to help victims of the war in Ukraine, has not been the target so far of any sanctions over Moscow's invasion. A spokeswoman for Abramovich said: ""We never comment on the movements of the yacht or any other vehicles or vessels."" The boat had been at the Barcelona shipyard since late 2021, a sector source said. It was unclear where it was headed. The European Commission has prepared a new package of sanctions against Russia and Belarus over the invasion of Ukraine that will hit additional Russian oligarchs and politicians and three Belarusian banks, three sources told Reuters on Tuesday. French authorities last week took into temporary custody four cargo vessels and one luxury yacht linked to Russian oligarchs as the United States and other governments ramped up sanctions on Russia's super-rich with links to President Vladimir Putin. At least five other superyachts owned by Russian billionaires were anchored or cruising in the Maldives last week, an island nation in the Indian nation with no extradition treaty with the United States. There are currently three other yachts reportedly tied to Russian oligarchs at the Barcelona shipyard, according to Marine Traffic. One of them is related to Sergei Chemezov, chief of Russian state aerospace and defence conglomerate Rostec, who was sanctioned last week by the United States. The other two are understood to belong to Russian oligarchs who have not been sanctioned - Andrey Molchanov, the main shareholder in Russian homebuilder LSR, and metals magnate Mikhail Prokhorov. Another superyacht, named Eclipse, which is also reportedly owned by Abramovich, was in Barcelona last autumn and is now in the Caribbean Sea near the British Virgin Islands.
