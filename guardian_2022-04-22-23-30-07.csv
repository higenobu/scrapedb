4/22/2022,"Lewis Hamilton has revealed his childhood love of football and a desire to make a positive impact on diversity in the sport as the motivation behind his involvement in a bid for Chelsea. Hamilton and his close friend Serena Williams have joined Martin Broughton’s consortium in what is believed to be a bid of more than £200m, which the seven-times Formula One world champion described as an “opportunity to be part of something great”. Hamilton confirmed his involvement on Thursday and speaking before this weekend’s Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola he explained what had prompted him to potentially invest in the Chelsea bid, even though he is an Arsenal fan. “I’ve been a football fan since I was a kid,” he said. “I used to play football with all the kids, I was really wanting to fit in. I was the only kid of colour there. The kids all supported someone different. One was Tottenham, one was Man United. I remember switching between these teams when I was younger and getting home and my sister Sam punching me several times in the arm, she basically beat me and said I had to support Arsenal. So from five or six years old I became a supporter of Arsenal. “But my Uncle Terry is a big Blues fan so I’ve been to so many games with him to watch Arsenal and Chelsea play. Ultimately I’m a sporting fan. It’s the biggest sport in the world and Chelsea is one of the biggest clubs in the world, and one of the most successful. When I heard about this opportunity I thought ‘Wow, this is one of the greatest opportunities to be part of something so great.’” There are three bids for Chelsea being considered by Roman Abramovich, club executives and the US bank Raine, which is overseeing the sale. Broughton, a businessman and former chair of Liverpool is a lifelong Chelsea fan and Hamilton maintained he shared with the consortium a positive vision for the club’s future. “This is a team, it’s all about the community, that’s what really makes a football team, it’s the people in and around it,” he said. “They’ve been quite leading in their work in diversity and inclusion, and becoming more diverse and progressive. Our goal is to continue some of the work they’ve already done and have even more of an impact and engage more with the community.” Hamilton said he had discussed the bid with Williams, who then also agreed to join him in investing. The British driver said the consortium’s values were aligned with his own and that should the bid win, it was to be a long-term project, with success as well as financial viability as key components. “Naturally it is never the idea of an investment [to lose money],” he said. “I want to be part of something, manage this team moving forward, improve that and make sure that doesn’t happen by slowly decreasing those losses and turn it into a profit-making organisation. There is not one part of that consortium that has a mindset of losing. I really think Chelsea already has a winning mindset but we can do better moving forwards.”",Sport/Sport,Lewis Hamilton’s love of football drove desire to join Broughton Chelsea bid,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/22/lewis-hamiltons-love-of-football-drove-desire-to-join-broughton-chelsea-bid
4/22/2022,"Matt Hancock’s “inside story of the pandemic” will be published later this year, he has announced. During an interview on GB News on Wednesday night, the former health secretary said he would be releasing a book about his experience of the Covid-19 pandemic, with royalties to be donated to NHS charities. Twitter users were quick to mock the West Suffolk MP, who resigned as health secretary after footage of him breaching his own Covid rules by kissing his aide Gina Coladangelo leaked last summer. One person tweeted that he “must be the least self-aware person on the planet” while another suggested that the book should be titled “the adulterer’s guide to social distancing”. The book, in which Hancock will look back at how he and his fellow ministers handled the coronavirus outbreak, has been bought by political publisher Biteback, which has previously published books by MP Oliver Letwin and rightwing commentator Katie Hopkins. The publisher said it is “delighted” to announce Hancock’s book, which it describes as a “unique and candid account of Britain’s battle to turn the tide against Covid-19”. The book will “offer an honest assessment of the lessons we need to learn for next time – because there will be a next time”, added the publisher.",Arts/Books,Matt Hancock to publish tell-all book on government’s handling of pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/22/matt-hancock-to-publish-tell-all-book-on-governments-handling-of-pandemic
4/22/2022,"This is not about Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars last month. Nobody needs to read more about that. It’s swimming in cold water, it’s how good Succession is: we know, so why hasn’t anyone mentioned it before? But that one rash moment and its afterlife is part of a bigger picture, a sense that something is not quite as it was. Last week, the Hollywood Reporter revealed that the organisers of the Tony awards, the New York ceremony that recognises excellence in Broadway theatre, sent an email revealing they now have a policy for dealing with violent incidents: “In the event of an incident, the perpetrator will be removed from the event immediately.” The Tonys, back for the first time since 2020 and celebrating its 75th year, draws no direct connection between this and Smith’s actions in March, but surely this has to be the first time that an entertainment awards ceremony has needed to explicitly state that you’re not allowed to perpetrate an act of violence while clapping for Moulin Rouge! The Musical. This protocol is aimed at an audience largely made up of professionals; while I have witnessed how heated feelings can become over whether this or that person more deserved their shiny trophy, the idea that there has to be a plan now for dealing with the possibility of that spilling over into violence is odd, isn’t it? Live entertainment in all forms, cut off during the pandemic, given little support in this country by the government, is now attempting to scratch and claw its way back in a near-impossible landscape. The audiences that feel brave enough to attend events may find themselves in a different world. Comedians talk about a mood shift, post-lockdowns, with audiences behaving badly; last week, Nish Kumar spoke of racist hecklers at his stand-up shows and said other comedians agree that “there’s something in the water”. In an Instagram video, the musician Adrianne Lenker, of the brilliant band Big Thief, said: “Try to be mindful of what’s happening and pay attention and don’t talk.” Trying to manage an audience’s behaviour is difficult. It exists on a sliding scale: a sign requesting that a crowd does not take photographs is not the same as an artist berating an audience for not clapping loudly enough, which I have seen before. But after a period away, this seems like a period of great readjustment, in which everyone is trying to find their feet. At least, that is one way to see it, if you want to remain hopeful.",Opinion/Opinion,Forget the likes of Will Smith.

4/22/2022,"The home secretary has been accused of misleading parliament after a high court ruling revealed that unpublished parts of a controversial policy to push back migrant dinghies in the Channel said the tactic would not be used against asylum seekers. The pushbacks policy was finalised in autumn 2021, yet in January this year Priti Patel said pushing back migrant boats was “absolutely still policy” when she gave evidence to the Lords justice and home affairs committee. She has been accused of giving that evidence even though she knew about the unpublished clauses in the policy not to use pushbacks against asylum seekers. The shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, accused Patel of misleading parliament and called on her to apologise: “This judgment reveals the home secretary connived to mislead refugees, voters and parliament that people expressly seeking asylum could be repelled in UK waters. Priti Patel must apologise and rethink large sections of her borders bill before it returns to the Lords. It is a disgraceful breach of the rule of law.” Details of the unpublished policy came to light during a legal challenge to the pushbacks plan brought by the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), and the NGOs Care4Calais, Channel Rescue and Freedom From Torture. The Home Office had applied to the high court for public interest immunity to avoid making the details of the pushbacks policy public. This mechanism is used where sensitive issues such as organised crime, terrorism or national security are involved. But judges said disclosure of the policy did not “give rise to a real risk of serious harm to the public interest”. The government has always said the pushbacks policy would only be used when safe to deploy it. Restrictions on usage of the tactic are outlined in the nationality and borders bill which is due to return to the House of Lords on 26 April. However, since the policy was announced last October ministers have not said publicly that it would not be used against asylum seekers. A key part of the unpublished policy disclosed in the high court judgment is that anyone in a dinghy who indicates they wish to claim asylum in the UK should not be pushed back but instead escorted to UK shores. Almost everyone who uses this method to reach the UK is an asylum seeker according to the Home Office’s own data. The ruling reveals the pushback policy states: “Should a migrant request asylum whilst in UK territorial waters they must be returned to the UK for processing.” According to the high court judgment, a clause in the unpublished policy says “the actual number of migrant vessels successfully intercepted is likely to be extremely low”. It adds that one of the “acceptable outcomes” is that during operational deployments no migrant vessels are assessed as suitable for safe turnaround. Paul O’Connor, the head of bargaining at the PCS, said: “PCS has been pressing the Home Office for transparency in these proceedings. They have gone to considerable lengths to keep certain matters shrouded in secrecy. This judgment has left them nowhere to hide and has exposed their real agenda.” Clare Moseley, the founder of Care4Calais, said: “I’m shocked that this government tried to hide the fact that refugees who request asylum in UK waters have a right to be brought to the UK to process that request.” Toufique Hossain, the director of public law at Duncan Lewis solicitors, who represents PCS and Care4Calais, described the judgment as “deeply concerning”. “In light of the extreme measures that are now being taken and proposed to prevent asylum claims being considered in the UK, there is a greater need than ever for transparency.” In a speech on 14 April about tackling illegal migration, the prime minister said Channel pushbacks were unlikely to be used much although provision for the tactic remained in the immigration bill. “It’s clear that there are extremely limited circumstances when you can safely do this in the English Channel,” Johnson said. The Home Office has been approached for comment.",News/UK news,Priti Patel accused of misleading parliament over refugee pushbacks,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/22/priti-patel-accused-misleading-parliament-refugee-pushbacks

4/22/2022,"The notion of “sustainable investing” had a bumper year in 2021. Aligning investments with climate goals – no fossil fuel companies, for example – promises a good financial return, while benefiting the planet. But is it too good to be true? I asked Tariq Fancy – CEO of non-profit digital learning charity Rumie and ex-head of sustainable investing for investment company BlackRock. Last year Fancy publicly denounced sustainable investing as a “dangerous placebo that harms the public interest”. I read a claim recently – from research led by Aviva and Make My Money Matter – that turning your pension “green” is 21 times more powerful in cutting your carbon footprint than stopping flying, becoming vegetarian and moving to a renewable energy provider combined.That’s ludicrous. Our individual actions reduce real-world emissions. Selling shares in polluting companies does not – it just means someone else buys those shares and owns those emissions. But sustainable investing must be doing something good?It is, in specific corners of the market. But those aren’t corners the average person can get into, commonly with pensions. The proof is in the pudding. Green investing has increased massively, yet emissions seem to be increasing alongside it. Since the 1980s, people have been beholden to a narrative that the free market will magically self-correct. But climate change is at its core a market failure, and it requires regulation. Investing in ESG falls into that trap. ESG investing – that’s a type of sustainable investing that involves buying shares in companies with a good score for “environmental, social and governance” …ExxonMobil used to have the same ESG score as Tesla! Because the scores are a mashup of different things. ExxonMobil has good governance and a diverse board, so they’re good on “G” and “S” but terrible on “E”. So when someone is investing in ethical or sustainable funds, they may find they’re investing in companies they’d be horrified by. How can this be OK?There hasn’t been any regulation, though increasingly there is in the EU. It’s like organic fruit 30 years ago. If no one polices what it is to be organic, then someone figuring people will pay more will put the organic sticker on. Tariq, this all sounds a bit evil.The economy is structured according to what’s profitable. That’s not because people are bad, but the way the system is designed. Fund managers have a legal obligation to focus on maximising profit. And because they’re managing someone else’s money, you don’t want them thinking about values, because everyone has different values. I see why you’ve said this system is not going to save the planet.A lot of the theory comes from divestment – that if I no longer own something, I’ll make the world better. But it makes no sense in practice. I’ve met Middle Eastern ethical investors who say, “We’re against drinking, we don’t want to own alcohol companies.” But they didn’t believe that by not owning them they stop people in France drinking wine. As long as something is legal and it makes money, someone will own it. Our greatest power is not as consumers but as voters. Only the government has the power to put a price on carbon, to set vehicle emissions limits and new efficiency standards for buildings. It’s wasting time, too. The eight-year-old in Bangladesh who has no carbon footprint is going to bear the brunt while Wall Street kicks the can down the road.

4/22/2022,"A woman has been convicted of manslaughter after her seven-year-old son died in Birmingham alone and “gasping for air” in a garden after suffering an asthma attack. Laura Heath “prioritised her addiction to heroin and crack cocaine”, leading to the neglect of Hakeem Hussain, who died in the Nechells area of the city on 26 November 2017. During the trial at Coventry crown court, jurors were shown an image depicting how Heath repurposed one of Hakeem’s inhalers as a crack pipe. The 40-year-old was convicted on Friday of gross negligence manslaughter, after admitting four counts of child cruelty before the trial, including failing to provide proper medical supervision and exposing Hakeem to class A drugs. Hakeem died at the home of a friend where his mother had been staying, after going outside during the night for fresh air, wearing only a top and pyjama bottoms in near freezing temperatures. The defendant, who had gone to bed after smoking heroin, said her son usually woke her up in the night when he was struggling to breathe. His body was found the next morning and there was no sign of his asthma medication being with him. Social services in Birmingham had been aware of Hakeem, and it emerged during the trial that at a child protection conference two days before his fatal collapse, a school nurse told the meeting that “he could die at the weekend”. Social workers had voted at the conference to act to protect Hakeem, and it was agreed that the family’s social worker would speak to Heath on Monday, but by that time the boy was dead. A serious case review into the contact that agencies had with Hakeem and his mother before his death is set to be published within weeks. Andy Couldrick, the head of Birmingham Children’s Trust, which took over child social services in early 2018, said: “There were some clear missed opportunities, [and] some of them are distressingly familiar in terms of other cases,” he said, adding that the child protection conference should have taken place earlier and led to immediate action. Hakeem’s death came months before responsibility was transferred from the council’s failing child social services department, after years of poor performance dating back to 2008. This led to a number of child deaths, such as those of Khyra Ishaq in 2008, Keanu Williams in 2011, and Daniel Pelka in 2012. “I think child social care in Birmingham did do some things wrong [in this case] and we have worked hard to learn those lessons,” he added. “Because every time we let this happen, we lose social workers. I hope we can be humble about the things which have gone wrong, and learn better from that.” Heath will be sentenced next week.",News/UK news,Manslaughter conviction for mother of seven-year-old who died ‘gasping for air’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/22/manslaughter-conviction-mother-hakeem-hussain-seven-gasping
4/22/2022,"On Wednesday, the All England Lawn Tennis Club – best known as the venue for the Wimbledon Championships – took the decision to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing at the grass court grand slam event due to the countries’ role in the ongoing war in Ukraine. The controversial decision, which marked first time players have been barred from competing on grounds of their nationality since German and Japanese players were excluded in the aftermath of World War II, meant that men’s world No 2 Daniil Medvedev and No 8 Andrey Rublev from Russia, as well as women’s fourth-ranked Aryna Sabalenka and world No 18 Victoria Azarenka of Belarus will be among those banned from the tournament. In a statement released Wednesday, the AELTC revealed that the decision was made in an effort to “limit Russia’s global influence through the strongest means possible”. “In the circumstances of such unjustified and unprecedented military aggression, it would be unacceptable for the Russian regime to derive any benefits from the involvement of Russian or Belarusian players with the Championships,” Wimbledon said in the statement. The AELTC’s decision to ban athletes based purely on their nationality sets a troubling precedent that penalizes individual athletes for decisions made by their governments. It is a form of discrimination that serves little purpose other than to fuel the Kremlin’s victim complex and strengthen Russian propaganda narrative of Western Russophobia. The ban was also met with strong disapproval by the men’s and women’s tour, as well as some of the sport’s leading athletes and former champions. The Women’s Tennis Association said that the ban was “neither fair nor justified,” while the Association of Tennis Professionals, which runs the men’s tennis tour, noted that discrimination based on nationality “constitutes a violation of our agreement with Wimbledon that states that player entry is based solely on ATP Rankings”. World No 1 Novak Djokovic, who was raised in war-torn Serbia, called Wimbledon’s decision “crazy”, adding that athletes should not be held responsible for the ongoing conflict. “I will always condemn war; I will never support war being myself a child of war,” Djokovic said at the Serbia Open on Wednesday. Martina Navratilova, one of the sport’s most renowned and successful champions, denounced the ban in an interview for LBC Radio, stating that she was “almost in tears” at the decision. “Russian players and Belarusian players, some have even expressed their opposition to the war,” Navratilova, who gave up her Czech nationality amidst the Cold War conflict in 1975 in exchange for US citizenship, said: “I understand the banning of teams, of course, but on an individual level, I just think it’s wrong.” Navratilova’s distinction between individual and team sports is worth elaborating upon. While team sports such as football are usually state-funded and utilized for soft power and state prestige – much like the Russian national team during the 2018 World Cup – the same methodology does not necessarily apply to athletes competing in individual sports such as tennis. Unless athletes have openly expressed their support for Russia’s ongoing war efforts in Ukraine, or have previously been associated with Russian president Vladimir Putin or other warmongers, it is incorrect to assume, as AELTC has, that their involvement in Wimbledon will be used to promote the Russian regime. Among those who are banned from competing at Wimbledon is Russian tennis star Andrey Rublev, who wrote “no war please“ on a camera following a victory at the Dubai Tennis Championships just days after Russia launched its war on Ukraine. He followed up at the press conference by stating: “It’s not about my match, how it affects me. What’s happening is much more terrible.” Yet despite his courageous stance at his own personal expense, Wimbledon has decided to bar him from competing at its event. Azarenka, a former world No 1, has also been banned from competing at Wimbledon despite not having lived in Belarus since she was 15. The two-time grand slam winner and gold medalist at the 2012 Olympic Games in London also released a statement on Twitter condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine, aided by her native Belarus. While several Ukrainian players welcomed Wimbledon’s ban, others such as Elina Svitolina argued that if some Russian and Belarusian players didn’t choose or vote for the governments responsible for the war, “then it’s fair they should be allowed to play and compete.” Wimbledon’s controversial ban also raises questions about whether such restrictive action will be applied equally to various conflicts around the world. Will tournaments ban Saudi Arabian athletes and block events in the United Arab Emirates for their respective roles in the ongoing war and humanitarian crisis in Yemen? Will Israeli athletes be subjected to bans for the treatment of Palestinians, which Human Rights Watch labeled as “crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution?” Will Chinese athletes be held accountable for the Chinese Communist Party’s crimes against humanity and systemic targeting of Uyghur Muslims? Unless athletes have shown support for any of the aforementioned crimes or the governments portraying them, it would be unfair to blame them for matters outside of their control. Wimbledon noted in its statement the possibility of revising its position “if circumstances change materially between now and June.” However, that would require a shift in policy from the British government or an end to the conflict—outcomes that are highly unlikely to occur in the allotted timeframe. There is also a case to be made that the decision to ban athletes from competing at international events will do little to prevent Putin from furthering his brutal war effort in Ukraine. Putin’s attack on Ukraine is rooted in imperialism, expansionism, and a determination to ensure Russia’s unimpeded status as a global superpower. This is evident from his prior war efforts in Chechnya, Georgia, and Syria. Therefore the suggestion that barring Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in international tournaments will pressure the despotic Russian leader from continuing his war is as misguided as it is laughable. While it is imperative to limit the scope of Russia’s influence and its ability to fund its war and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine through targeted sanctions and by providing Ukraine with economic aid and support, a blanket ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes does not achieve the stated goal and instead fuel anti-Russian fervor and further divides an already polarized sports world.",Sport/Sport,Wimbledon’s decision to bar Russian and Belarusian athletes sets a bad precedent | Karim Zidan,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/22/wimbledons-decision-bar-russian-belarusian-athletes
4/22/2022,"Two years after it was derailed by the pandemic, the Bridge festival, a pan-European celebration of music for strings, has come to Glasgow this weekend. This opening concert was a collaboration of the four participating ensembles: Ensemble Resonanz (Hamburg), PLMF Music Trust (Estonia), Trondheim Soloists (Norway) and the Scottish Ensemble, under the direction of conductor Catherine Larsen-Maguire. Described as a conversation, a survey of the landscape of European music and a discussion between its heritage and contemporary composition, the concert spanned 900 years of repertoire and included two world premieres. Though the concept was bold, it felt like something of a lost opportunity; the potential of having 50 virtuoso string players together only realised in the second half of the programme. Neither Giovanni Gabrieli’s adventurous 14-part Sonata 18, nor Hildegard von Bingen’s ecstatic hymn O Ecclesia was heard to best advantage in the resolutely dry acoustics of the Barrowland Ballroom – or on string instruments – despite the haunting sound of Scottish Ensemble artistic director Jonathan Morton’s solo violin in the latter. The Adagietto from Mahler’s Fifth Symphony, the fulcrum between past and present, seemed rather out of place sandwiched between the two new works, for all it provided an opportunity to admire the rich sonority of the combined string forces. As for the new works, there was a certain sense of sameness. Mica Levi’s Flag was an exercise in white noise effects without much sense of structure. Erkki-Sven Tüür’s Deep Dark Shine had more impetus and energy but inhabited a similar sonic space. In their use of extended techniques (lots of playing on the bridge, tapping the belly of the instruments and sliding up and down the fingerboard) both pieces clearly owed a debt to Penderecki’s Polymorphia for 48 string instruments, a pioneering work of 1960s avant garde, and the opening piece in the second half of the programme. The work is bold and original, but its experimentation seems more of an end in itself than a path to be followed. Jonny Greenwood’s thoroughly postmodern 48 Responses to Polymorphia closed the concert. For all his use of extended technique, Greenwood interrogates his hero Penderecki’s work through his own musical language, including that most valuable commodity: humour.",Arts/Music,The Bridge festival opening night review – massed strings span 900 years of music,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/the-bridge-festival-opening-night-review-barrowland-ballroom-glasgow
4/22/2022,"Tequila, the agave-derived spirit born in the Mexican town that shares its name, has long been associated in the UK with poor-quality shots. But that’s old news. After years of being sidelined and misunderstood, tequila is now one of the fastest-growing spirits categories in the UK, with a rising number of consumers recognising it as a versatile and delicious craft spirit – one to be enjoyed and savoured. Consejo Regulador del Tequila – the organisation responsible for protecting the drink’s denomination of origin – reported that 1.7m litres of tequila were shipped to the UK in 2020. John Vine, spirits buyer at Waitrose, says that the company saw tequila sales grow by more than 127% from 2019 to 2021. “Celebrity endorsements from people such as George Clooney and Kendal Jenner have helped raise awareness of the category and bring in a new audience,” he explains. “People are increasingly realising that it is versatile, refreshing in cocktails, and not just for shots.” Carlos Fontoira, head of bars at boutique Mexican restaurant chain El Pastor, says that it’s a trend he’s seen first-hand. “Over the years at El Pastor I’ve witnessed our guests getting more into tequila,” he says. “They’re moving away from thinking of it as only for shots and starting to consider its possibilities as a premium sipping spirit. They’re also more willing to try different tequila cocktails.” But why has it taken British drinkers so long to embrace Mexico’s signature spirit? “I think tequila has always been the odd one out for consumers in the UK,” says Daniele Umoette, ambassador for el Jimador’s 100% blue agave tequila. “Consumers in the UK are more used to scotch, gin and rum because of the historical ties this nation has with such spirits.” Tequila, particularly el Jimador, is worthy of note though, Umoette says. “El Jimador is produced at Casa Herradura, our distillery in the town of Amatitán, Mexico. Despite being relatively young as a brand [launched in 1994], we have 152 years of distilling knowledge from our sister brand Herradura. El Jimador is a 100% agave tequila and that speaks volumes about its quality. Its wild fermentation also contributes to generating its beautiful flavour.” The percentage of agave – a succulent, which is often mistaken for a cactus due to its spiky leaves – is the difference between a poor-quality tequila and a good one, explains Ruben Aceves, global brand ambassador of Casa Herradura. “When tequila is made from 100% agave, it means there are no other sugar sources within it. So, if a tequila has only 51% agave juices, the other 49% can be from any neutral spirit, from whichever fermentable source such as corn, wheat, sugar cane, or a blend of them. And this can be done without having to explain it to the consumer.” Equally, the process and quality control of the individual distillery is vital to the end result. At el Jimador’s iconic distillery, for instance, the production process begins with seven-year-old agave plants, which are harvested by hand by jimadors (farmers). “We then run the agave through blades to cut it into very tiny pieces and run those through the diffuser; this is a very efficient milling device which extracts all the possible agave juice,” says Aceves. “After a diffusion process, agave juice is collected and cooked in stainless steel pressure cookers. This loads the sweet agave juice with sugar.” The next step is fermentation, which at el Jimador is a completely natural process, using only wild airborne yeast from the agave plantations and fruit trees surrounding the distillery. “After fermentation is done in our open tanks, we get a 6% ABV [alcohol by volume] agave juice. Now the sugar is gone, and the alcohol appears with lots of beautiful, tasty flavours and a unique aroma that’s easy and pleasant to enjoy.” From here, the liquid is distilled twice, the minimum requirement for a tequila, resulting in a 55% ABV blanco tequila that’s clear, flavourful, and smooth. It’s then made into a range of different ABVs, depending on each country’s rules. “Once the ABV is adjusted with clean, beautiful water, it’s aired for some hours and then bottled as a blanco or sent to ageing if it is going to be a reposado or añejo. The ageing process for el Jimador is done in white American oak barrels, which are specially made for us,” Aceves adds. “The barrels are made in Kentucky USA; they are toasted, charred and have a 200-litre capacity.” Aceves feels passionately that it’s this chain of small details and quality control that makes el Jimador so special, with such a distinct and delicious profile. So, what’s the most modern way to enjoy tequila according to the experts? Of course, a zingy margarita made with freshly squeezed lime juice is always popular – in fact, research found that it was the second most Googled cocktail recipe in the early months of the UK’s first lockdown. However, for a more authentic experience, Umoette suggests the Paloma, Mexico’s preferred tequila cocktail. “This drink is a combination of tequila, pink grapefruit juice, agave syrup, a squeeze of lime and a dash of soda water, served in a salt-rimmed highball glass,” he explains. “The citrus and bright notes from our wild fermentation complement the peppery and spicy flavours of the Mexican cuisine beautifully, making it a perfect cocktail for sharing with food.” However you choose to drink it, Vine urges that you start with a high-quality, authentic tequila. “If you are looking at it for cocktail-making, you should opt for a blanco or reposado. For sipping, you’re looking at an añejo,” he says. “And always, 100% blue agave should be your starting point.” Discover the vibrant taste of modern Mexico for yourself with el Jimador’s 100% blue weber agave tequila.
