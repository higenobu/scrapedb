1/1/2022,"Four decades into a career as deep and arpeggiated as it has been long, self-taught guitarist Johnny Marr is currently in the midst of a flurry of EP releases – Fever Dreams Pts 1-4, set to be compiled as a double album in February. Since revolutionising the guitar band with his trademark ringing melodies in the Smiths in the 1980s, the prolific guitarist – born Johnny Maher – has rarely paused to retune. Alongside his solo output, Marr has also been one of the most fervent collaborators of his generation, doing time in bands including Modest Mouse and the Cribs, as well as his own outfit, the Healers, and Electronic with fellow Mancunian Bernard Sumner.  Pals with Pet Shop Boys and au fait with Oasis, he worked on the score for Inception. Earlier this year Marr collaborated with Hans Zimmer – and Billie Eilish – on the Bond soundtrack, and next year he is set to tour with Blondie. Marr’s status as one of the most original electric guitarists of our time is, of course, laid atop a solid grounding in British folk, best seen in his work with the late Bert Jansch. This is your chance to quiz Marr. Perhaps: does being a straight-edge vegan help with his extraordinary work rate? What was he trying to achieve with that low-flying-aircraft intro to How Soon Is Now?

1/1/2022,"Iconsider myself to be “transportationally challenged” – that is to say, I can’t drive a car, ride a bike, ice-skate, ski or swim (at least not in a way that doesn’t endanger others, given my aggressively flailing limbs). Any method of moving from one place to another aside from walking eludes me. It’s probably no surprise to hear that I can’t rollerskate, either. To me, rollerskating borders on black magic. I watch in awe as pros pull off precarious moves with the nonchalance of someone taking a stroll to the corner shop. It’s an enviable, effortless kind of cool, exemplified by the Berlin-based rollerskater Oumi Janta, whose videos went viral during lockdown. Last June, she posted a clip on Instagram that featured her rollerskating while dancing – backwards. It garnered more than 2.9m views and helped launch a cabal of rollerskating influencers.  Google searches for “rollerskates” had already started to rise, with global searches for the word increasing by 77% between March and May 2020, when, months later, the fourth season of The Crown furthered the fervour with scenes of Diana, Princess of Wales whizzing her way through Buckingham Palace. So when thinking about how to escape my comfort zone, I plumped for the activity that had the potential to make me look the most stupid, but also, if I managed to pull it off, the coolest. I arrive at Roller Nation in north London on a damp and dreary afternoon, desperate to get my rollerskating lesson over and done with. Glimpsing knee pads on a table as I step inside, I am struck with thoughts of how inevitable it is that I’ll fall over, but my nerves are soon calmed by the venue’s sparkling disco balls and my unnaturally patient instructor, Nele, the founder of the rollerskating school Isle of Skating in London. My first topple comes about six minutes in and means Nele takes me back to basics, teaching me how to fall correctly – which is harder than it sounds. The trick is to land on your knees, rather than your bum. Having perfected the art of falling over, I feel slightly less worried about the likelihood of having to leave the venue on a stretcher. I am ready for more. The second rule of skating, it seems, is multitasking: something else I’m notoriously bad at. Keeping your feet in, knees low, chest high, bum low, and arms in, while propelling yourself forward by shifting your weight from side to side is … difficult. All the while, you must avoid looking at your feet – Nele takes to asking me how many fingers she’s holding up, in order to stop me gazing at the floor and, ultimately, falling towards it. After many unsteady laps around the rink, walking like a penguin on my skates with Nele holding my hand, I am surprised to see I am absentmindedly skating solo. Who would have thought the phrase “practice makes perfect” might have some truth to it? Leaving my comfort zone wasn’t exactly painless – I’m still nursing a bruised arm – but it was worth it. I probably won’t be signing up to a roller derby or showing off my moves at a roller disco just yet, but I wholly intend to keep learning. I leave feeling buoyed up by the experience and hoping that, next summer, I might finally have the confidence to take on my lifelong enemy: the bicycle.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Escape your comfort zone: I can’t ride a bike, drive a car or swim.

1/1/2022,"Can Manchester United start 2022 with their most convincing display yet under Ralf Rangnick when Wolves visit? Thursday’s victory over Burnley was the best performance under the interim manager but still lacked a compelling rhythm that allowed United to govern the contest and it suggested the structural stability the German yearns for is yet to form.

1/1/2022,"Everton bid to start the year with a much-needed victory after a torrid run that has resulted in one win from their past 11 matches. Rafael Benítez is under significant pressure from supporters sceptical from the outset owing to his Liverpool history. Their last match, on 16 December, was a draw at Chelsea, but Benítez needs wins to quieten the discontent at Goodison. By a strange quirk of fate, Brighton’s 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday was the exact same outcome as Everton’s most recent game. Graham Potter’s side are in much better shape than their opponents, however, with Danny Welbeck’s equaliser lifting them into the top half of the table.

Patrick Bamford is set to return to the home attack, though, after hamstring trouble and, although Bielsa’s principal striker is expected to begin on the bench, he will doubtless be anxious to enter the fray and jog Sean Dyche’s memory.

1/1/2022,"A record number of people are expected to try to eat only plant-based foods this month as growing concern about the climate crisis heightens interest in the Veganuary movement. The global campaign is gathering momentum as more large employers promote it internally. This year, Harrods, Superdrug and Volkswagen UK are among the big names taking part in the Veganuary “workplace challenge” for the first time.  The corporate push involves making more vegan food available at work as well as running education and morale-boosting events to help participants keep going throughout the month. More than 500,000 people signed up to take part in last year’s Veganuary, about a quarter of whom – 125,000 – were based in the UK. However, the campaign’s research suggests that potentially 10 times as many people participate and a significant number continue with plant-based diets beyond the end of the month. By the end of January, Veganuary expects to have reached the milestone of 2 million participants since its launch in 2014. It passed 1 million sign-ups in October 2020. A YouGov poll of 2,079 UK adults for Veganuary found 4% planned to participate. Extrapolated to all UK adults, that would equate to 2.7 million people. The survey found that attitudes towards veganism had become more positive over the past two years, with 36% describing it as an “admirable thing to do”. Veganuary’s Toni Vernelli said that 20 years ago if people said they were vegan, others would think it was a “weird thing to do” or “quite extreme”. “Now the first thing people say is ‘oh, I’m really cutting back on my meat and dairy consumption,’ and nine times out of 10 the reason is the environment.” At the same time, going vegan is not the food-eliminating challenge it once was. There has been a gold rush in the food industry with investors pouring billions into alt-meat and dairy brands, a trend that has resulted in thousands of new products including high-profile innovations such as plant-based bars of Cadbury Dairy Milk. With more than 50,000 products certified by the Vegan Society, there has been no let-up before the 2022 campaign, with a welter of treats arriving on supermarket shelves and menus in the coming days. A number of the most anticipated launches can be found in the cheese aisle. A vegan Babybel, made out of coconut oil and starch and wrapped in green rather than the brand’s trademark red wax, will make its debut. An almond- and oat-based Philadelphia spread is also coming. Forty-two companies in the UK have signed up to the workplace challenge this year, including Marks & Spencer, the professional services firms PwC and EY, and the insurer Hastings Direct. Cian O’Brien, the director of Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles UK, said the company was focused on becoming more sustainable, and that went beyond its work on electrification. “Sustainability is broader and the opportunity to make a personal contribution through changing our habits has to be explored,” he said. Vernelli said it was important for business leaders to “set the tone”. “Our meat and dairy consumption is not sustainable and the leaders in our society have to take action on this. By taking part in the workplace challenge, they’re not only publicly showing their commitment to sustainability, but also to their staff and leading by example,” she said. “I’m think it is incredible to have someone like Harrods taking part,” she added. “It shows that veganism cuts across all demographics. It isn’t a leftwing or rightwing thing or a class thing. We’ve got participants and businesses across all the whole spectrum.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Veganuary set to pass 2m milestone as more firms join movement ,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/01/veganuary-set-to-pass-2m-milestone-as-more-firms-join-movement
