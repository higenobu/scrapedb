4/30/2022,"Inflation surged 8.5% for the year through March, the fastest pace since December 1981. And last month, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rates for the first time since 2018. But with most savings accounts still paying less than 0.7% annually, things remain challenging for investors looking to earn a passive income. The good news? Even in the current interest rate environment, you can find companies paying generous dividends to investors. Rock-solid dividend stocks can help investors diversify their growth-oriented portfolios. At the same time, they offer a reliable income stream so investors don’t have to time the market to make money in stocks. Here’s a look at three dividend stocks that could be an opportunity for income investors for the rest of 2022. At a time when many brick-and-mortar retailers remain in the doldrums, powerhouse Walmart stands out. The company runs a massive retail business with approximately 10,500 stores under 46 banners in 24 countries. Thanks to its “Everyday Low Prices,” Walmart attracts around 230 million customers to its stores and websites every week. Walmart has thrived during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the three months ended Jan. 31, 2022, revenue grew 0.5% year over year to $152.9 billion. Notably, comparable-store sales — a key measure of a retailer’s health — at Walmart U.S. rose 5.6%. The company has also capitalized on the e-commerce boom, which is often considered a threat to physical retailers. Compared to two years ago, Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales grew 70%. The retail giant started paying dividends in 1974 and has increased its payout every year since. With a quarterly dividend rate of 56 cents per share, Walmart offers an annual yield of 1.6%. When you make payments to a company every month, wouldn’t it be nice to get some cash back from it? Well, investors can do that with Verizon — one of the largest telecommunication companies in the U.S. that also happens to be paying generous and reliable dividends. Millions and millions of people pay Verizon every month to use the company’s service. Its 4G LTE network covers 99% of the American population, and more than 230 million people are already covered by its 5G network. Verizon has been raising its payout annually and currently offers an annual dividend yield of 5% — a very generous amount in today’s market. Business is growing, too. The company’s wireless segment had 1.06 million retail postpaid net additions in Q4 of 2021. Operating revenue totaled $34.1 billion, up 4.8% year-over-year after adjusting for the sale of Verizon Media. Despite Verizon’s solid business and rising dividend payouts, its shares have slipped 11% over the past 12 months. With most of the market looking expensive by historical standards, Verizon could give contrarian investors something to think about. If Verizon’s 5% yield still isn’t juicy enough for you, check out Ellington Financial. Headquartered in Old Greenwich, Conn., Ellington Financial has a portfolio of financial assets that provide it with a predictable income stream. It then passes those profits to shareholders through monthly dividends. The company’s investments include residential and commercial mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities and consumers loans among others. While Ellington isn’t a widely followed financial play, it stands out in today’s market due to the sheer size of its payout. With a monthly dividend rate of 15 cents per share and a current stock price of $17.75, the company offers a staggering annual yield of 10.1%. In Q4 of 2021, Ellington Financial generated core earnings of $24.9 million, or 44 cents per share. Its book value per share at the end of December was $18.39.

4/30/2022,"By Sheila Dang and Katie Paul (Reuters) -Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal sought to quell employee anger on Friday during a company-wide meeting where employees demanded answers to how managers planned to handle an anticipated mass exodus prompted by Elon Musk. The meeting comes after Musk, the Tesla chief executive who sealed a $44 billion deal to buy the social media company, repeatedly criticized Twitter's content moderation practices and a top executive responsible for setting speech and safety policies. At the internal town hall meeting, which was heard by Reuters, executives said the company would monitor staff attrition daily, but it was too soon to tell how the buyout deal with Musk would affect staff retention. Musk has pitched lenders on slashing board and executive salaries but exact cost cuts remain unclear, according to sources familiar with the matter. One source said Musk would not make decisions on job cuts until he assumes ownership of Twitter. ""I'm tired of hearing about shareholder value and fiduciary duty. What are your honest thoughts about the very high likelihood that many employees will not have jobs after the deal closes?"" one Twitter employee asked Agrawal, in a question read aloud during the meeting. Agrawal answered that Twitter has always cared about its employees and would continue to do so. ""I believe the future Twitter organization will continue to care about its impact on the world and its customers,"" he said. Executives said during the meeting that the employee attrition rate has not changed compared to the levels before the news of Musk's interest in buying the company. In recent days, Musk has tweeted criticism of Twitter's top lawyer, Vijaya Gadde, who is a Twitter veteran and widely-respected across Silicon Valley. Musk's attack triggered a barrage of online harassment targeting her. Employees also told executives they feared Musk's erratic behavior could destabilize Twitter's business, and hurt it financially as the company prepares to address the advertising world in a presentation next week in New York City. ""Do we have a strategy in the near-term on how to handle advertisers pulling investment,"" one employee asked. Sarah Personette, Twitter's chief customer officer, said the company was working to communicate frequently with advertisers and reassure them ""the way that we service our customers is not changing."" After the meeting, a Twitter employee told Reuters there was little trust in what executives had to say. ""The PR speak is not landing. They told us don't leak and do a job you are proud of, but there is no clear incentive for employees to do this,"" the employee told Reuters, noting that compensation for non-executive staffers is now capped because of the deal. Agrawal is estimated to receive $42 million if he were terminated within 12 months of a change in control at the social media company, according to research firm Equilar. During the meeting, Agrawal urged staff to expect change in the future under new leadership, and acknowledged that the company could have performed better over the years. ""Yes, we could have done things differently and better. I could have done things differently. I think about that a lot,"" he said. Twitter declined further comment.

4/30/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Bond manager Mark Kiesel sold his California home in 2006, when he presciently predicted the housing bubble would pop. He bought again in 2012, after U.S. prices fell more than 30% and found a floor. Most Read from Bloomberg Four European Gas Buyers Made Ruble Payments to Russia Putin Is Losing So Here’s How He’ll Make the War Worse U.S. Economy Posts Surprise Contraction, Belying Solid Consumer Picture A Powerful Dynasty Bankrupted Sri Lanka in Just 30 Months Stocks Surge Before Amazon Casts Shadow Over Rally: Markets Wrap Now, after a record surge in prices, Kiesel says the time to sell is once again at hand. Sky-high values, soaring interest rates and other costs of homeownership -- maintenance, property taxes and utilities -- dampen prospects for future appreciation, according to Kiesel, chief investment officer for global credit at Pacific Investment Management Co. He’s weighing putting his Orange County house on the market and becoming a renter rather than an owner. “I can look at my long-term 25-year charts and they tell me when to buy and sell and they’re flashing orange right now,” Kiesel, 52, said during an interview at Pimco’s Newport Beach, California, headquarters. “I think we’re in the final innings.” Home prices soared almost 20% in the 12 months through February, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index, as pandemic moves, low borrowing costs and a dearth of inventory spurred heated competition for housing. But the market is now facing the fastest rise in mortgage rates in decades as the Federal Reserve works to tamp down inflation. The average 30-year rate is now 5.1%, close to a 12-year high, Freddie Mac data show. Home sales contracts, a leading indicator, fell for the fifth consecutive month in March as rising borrowing costs added to affordability pressures, the National Association of Realtors reported on Wednesday. Prophetic Choices Kiesel’s possible sale is a personal move and not a forecast of a crash by Pimco, which in March put out a note predicting “No Bust After the Boom” following years of housing undersupply. “Estimates of this secular shortage range from two to five million houses,” according to the authors. Related: Pimco’s Kiesel Says Cash Position at 10%-12%, Cuts Credit Risk But Kiesel’s past personal decisions have proved prophetic. He sold his Newport Beach house in May 2006, calling housing “the next Nasdaq bubble.” Home prices peaked that year before going on to plunge, triggering the global financial crisis. “It’s not just houses that will be for sale,” Kiesel said in a June 2006 interview. “You’re going to see financial assets for sale over time, and ultimately corporate bonds.” Then in May 2012, Kiesel decided it was time to own again, buying a golf course-adjacent home. “For those of you renting or on the sidelines, I recommend you at least consider getting ‘back in’ and buying a house,” he wrote in a credit market note. “The future is hard to predict, but U.S. housing is healing and is probably close to a bottom.” ‘Max 2% Return’ U.S. housing prices have more than doubled in the past decade and the house Kiesel bought for $2.9 million in 2012 now has an estimated value of $5.5 million, according to Redfin Corp. Buying a home in today’s market would likely yield about a 2% return, Kiesel said. He considers his home as an investment, refusing to form an emotional attachment to his property. “It’s only a good investment if you buy it the right time,” he said. “If I were to buy a house today, I would probably get max 2% return on it. And I can find other things I can make money on other than a house.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek An Entire Neighborhood Is Being Flipped by a Los Angeles Developer The 400 Airplanes That Russia Seized Have Become an Epic Insurance Struggle China’s Biggest Covid Failure Is Not Deploying an mRNA Vaccine China’s Campaign to Wipe Out Covid Is Crushing Its Economy How One Rogue Exec Thrust Levi’s Into the Culture Wars ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•yesterday,Investor Who Called Housing Top and Bottom Says It's Time to Sell,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pimco-kiesel-called-housing-top-160339396.html
4/30/2022,"Rivian's (RIVN) recent stock performance may have burned a hole in many a retail investor's portfolio. It's also burned a big hole in Ford (F), and now Amazon's, quarterly performance. Last night in its first quarter earnings report, Amazon (AMZN) revealed it booked a $7.6 billion mark-to-market loss on its investment in Rivian, which led to an overall $3.8 billion net loss for the quarter. Amazon owns an 18% stake in the electric vehicle maker. Earlier this week, Ford reported an overall $3.1 billion loss for the first quarter, due to its mark-to-market loss of $5.4 billion on its Rivian investment. Ford has a 12% stake in Rivian. While the two companies are still up on their initial investments, it's been a rocky road for Rivian shareholders recently. Rivian shares were down more than 50% in the first quarter, and down nearly 70% year to date. Recall after its IPO, Rivian had a market cap of around $86 billion; today it's around a third of that, at $28.9 billion. The future of these investments in Rivian by Ford and Amazon is an open question. When asked about Ford's Rivian investment as the 180-day lockup period nears expiration, Ford CEO Jim Farley made it firmly clear the company would not be commenting on the future of the investment at this time. Note that Rivian and Ford's Lincoln luxury brand were planning to make an electric vehicle (EV) together, but those plans were squashed. That, combined with Ford's definitive ""no comment"" on Rivian raises the question whether Ford's Rivian investment might change in some manner. Amazon was not asked about its investment in Rivian on the earnings call, but with its 100,000 electric delivery van order in the books with Rivian, and Rivian SUVs appearing at Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin rocket launches as service vehicles, it seems the online retail behemoth may stick with its stake, for now. Regardless of what Amazon and Ford do, Rivian has a lot of work to do. Rivian produced 2,553 vehicles in Q1 and delivered 1,227 of them. If the company intends to hit its goal of 25,000 vehicles produced in 2022, it will really have to ramp up as the year progresses. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe isn't exactly signaling that this won't be a problem. In an interview last week with the Wall Street Journal from the Rivian factory floor, Scaringe said, ""The world’s [battery] cell production combined represents well under 10% of what we will need in 10 years ... Meaning, 90% to 95% of the supply chain does not exist."" Ford and its crosstown rival GM (GM) have both said they have acquired enough battery materials and semiconductor chips to meet their initial goals of EV production over the next couple of years. Based on what Scaringe said last week, it seems Rivian is foreshadowing future issues it sees with acquiring battery materials like lithium. Investors and industry watchers will get to hear more on Rivian's production and financial standing when the automaker reports first quarter financial results on Wednesday, May 11, after the market close. —— Pras Subramanian is a senior autos reporter for Yahoo Finance.

4/30/2022,"Elon Musk reportedly has some new plans for Twitter's C-suite. The Tesla CEO whose recent $44 billion bid to acquire Twitter was accepted is now putting plans in place for a new CEO at the San Francisco company, according to Reuters, which reported that Musk has decided on who he plans to appoint but has yet to publicly release the name. Musk reportedly reiterated to Twitter Chairman Bret Taylor that he isn't confident regarding the company’s management — a tone he had struck in his earlier SEC filings — and he also told banks that he plans to create a way to monetize tweets that go viral or include important information and suggested charging a fee when third-party websites quote or embed tweets from verified accounts.",Business/American City Business Journals•3 hours ago,Elon Musk reportedly has new Twitter CEO lined up,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/1ccc69ab-32a1-3e7d-845d-6172a3d2ff98/elon-musk-reportedly-has-new.html
4/30/2022,"Lately, the prospect of an economic slowdown has struck fear into traders and economists alike. This month, The World Bank slashed its projection for global economic growth. The Dow (^DJI) fell 810 points, or 2.4%, on Tuesday in part over concerns of a downturn. And Deutsche Bank raised the possibility of a ""major recession"" as result of Federal Reserve rate hikes and asset tapering in a recent note. In a new interview, Wall Street veteran and investing guru Sallie Krawcheck took those fears one step further, saying a recession is inevitable. While she acknowledged the timeline and nature of the downturn remain uncertain, Krawcheck urged investors to diversify their holdings in order to withstand the hard economic times. ""Sure, a recession is on the way,"" says Krawcheck, the co-founder and CEO of an investing platform for women called Ellevest. ""I don't know when. Nobody knows when. Inflation will go up at some point [and] down at some point."" As the U.S. struggles with its worst bout of inflation in four decades, the Federal Reserve signaled an aggressive series of rate hikes that may tame cost increases, but could also cool economic growth. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last Thursday expressed openness to a 50-basis point rate hike in May, noting the potential benefits of ""front loading"" the central bank's policy moves. The onset of tight monetary policy “will push the economy into a significant recession by late next year,"" Deutsche Bank Head of Research David Folkerts-Landau warned in his note on Tuesday. In this episode of Influencers, Andy sits down with Ellevest CEO and Co-Founder Sallie Krawcheck, for a discussion about how the Ellevest platform uses an algorithm tailored for women as well as the possibility of a recession, and the meme stock craze being 'bro-ey.' To be sure, some observers have rejected fears of a recession. Canaccord strategist Tony Dwyer told CNBC last month that concern about a recession based on an inversion in parts of the treasury yield curve has been overstated. Since ""the market is so often wrong,"" traders should diversify their portfolios as a hedge against a range of outcomes, said Krawcheck, who formerly led the Wealth Management divisions at both Merrill Lynch and Citi (C). ""A diversified portfolio is what matters because the number of active managers who correctly call this stuff consistently, you and I both know, is a tiny, single-digit percentage,"" she says. Krawcheck began her career on Wall Street as a junior analyst at Solomon Brothers in the late 1980s. Since then, she's witnessed several recessions over more than three decades working in the finance industry, most notably the Great Recession of 2008, when she held a front row seat as a top executive in wealth management at Citi. Speaking to Yahoo Finance, Krawcheck said attempts to play the market in the short term often lead investors astray. ""We tell our women, 'Investing should be sort of boring,'""she says ""It shouldn't be all about making the calls.""
