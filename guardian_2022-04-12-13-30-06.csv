4/12/2022,"Within the ruins of time, as the avalanche of blows continue to pound our bodies and spirits, I have found myself ruminating on the violence that is at the heart of Australia’s reconciliation process. History is alive, and for the best part of the last two decades, Australia’s reconciliation process has been cleverly wielded to thwart off the threat of a Black-led uprising from bursting out of the empire’s belly. Instead of an audacious experiment that reparatively runs against the tide of history, Australia has carefully opted for what Prof Megan Davis describes as “a manifesto for maintaining the status quo”. Davis’s summation is backed by Charlotte Lloyd, a Harvard sociologistwho studied Australia’s reconciliation process because she found it to be globally unique. While almost all reconciliation processes derive from the foundations of truth and justice, conveniently, Australia’s did not. Despite generations of state-sanctioned savagery, when the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation folded in 2001, prime minister John Howard ensured that Australia removed itself from the truth and justice components that underpinned the theory and practice of reconciliation globally. Australia avoided the establishment of a formal truth-telling process to bring the settlers’ atrocities to the surface and a mechanism of justice to hold the perpetrators to account. This ensured, among many things, that the original lie of terra nullius remained, Indigenous people were deprived of reparations for the gross and systematic human rights violations that we faced, and that open season would continue. The Howard government’s decision to absolve itself from the truth and justice components was an attempt to exonerate white Australia of accountability. In 2006, Reconciliation Australia launched a uniquely Australian initiative, Reconciliation Action Plans (RAPs), a framework that is said to enable organisations to take meaningful action to advance reconciliation – with procurement and employment being the major benchmarks of progress. In June of the following year, barely 12 months after the launch of RAPs, the Howard government, with enthusiastic support from it’s Labor opposition, suspended the Racial Discrimination Act to implement the Northern Territory Intervention – allowing martial law to be invoked upon 65 Aboriginal communities until they were acquired by the government. The NT Intervention (which was then extended by successive governments until 2022) has supercharged the devastating socio-economic outcomes for Indigenous communities. Conveniently, it has also opened up huge swathes of land for extractive companies to pillage and plunder. Speaking with me recently, Senator Patrick Dodson described the NT Intervention as “the darkest day in Australia’s political history”; a serious feat considering the depth and scale of malice that Canberra has conjured over the years. A few months later, 144 countries voted in favour of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), at the UN general assembly in New York. Shamelessly, Australia, alongside New Zealand, Canada and the US were the only countries to vote against it. Oren R Lyons, Faithkeeper of the Turtle Clan from the Onondaga Nation, writes that the passing of UNDRIP was a “hard blow to the racist doctrine that had imprisoned all humanity – the gatekeepers as well as their Indigenous victims – since 1492”. All of this is important because in a global era of restoration and repair, and as RAPs were being ushered forward as the “centrepiece of practical reconciliation” that would launch Australia into a new and harmonious era, the Australian government continued its quest to dominate the natives. Despite claims that RAPs support First Nations self-determination, the reality is that they are designed to accommodate whiteness and advance institutional aspirations. They are nothing more than a means to an end; a tool for its’ holders to maintain their image and market share by posturing as a valiant corporate citizen devoted to human care. Atop of the RAP apex are companies like Westpac, whose investment strategy includes financing industries with business models that rely on the extinguishment of our rights to, and relationship with, the lands that they plunder. Broadspectrum, which builds prisons for Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander people to fill, is another company that has ascended to the position of being a champion of change. Alongside them is BHP, who destroy our songlines and erode our sovereignty by obliterating the worlds most significant cultural heritage sites, and Services Australia, who administer a human rights breaching cashless debit card to a majority Indigenous populace. But it’s more than just the explicit functionality and behaviours espoused by these companies that undermines whatever integrity reconciliation ever had. By accommodating whiteness, “compatibility” between the natives and the settlers is measured by assimilatory definitions of success, forcing Indigenous people to integrate and align with institutional aspirations by conceding our own. RAPs have helped create an entire complex of learning modules focused on convenient market trends rather than dignified truths. Optional learning modules such as “cultural competency training” – whereby a millennia of genius is dumbed down into a 20-minute powerpoint presentation – and “unconscious bias training”, a false doctrine designed to circumnavigate race and power, embolden settlers to destructively take up more space, not relinquish it. The careful placement of Aboriginal art on the walls helps paint a narrative of a vibrant and inclusive workplace, while the sterile and performative delivery of acknowledgments of country assuages a perception of atonement for all of the settlers’ ongoing sins. They seem to say: “This is more than enough, it’s time to call it square and move on.” By unpacking the mechanics of Australia’s standardised commitment to reconciliation, you can see how RAPs are giving their holders licence to inflict more harm on the communities they claim to be in steadfast solidarity with. Violence isn’t just the norm, but a necessity. As John Howard knew in the early 2000’s, and as we are seeing now, a money-hungry and growth-at-all-costs society is entirely incompatible with the sovereignty of Indigenous peoples and our ontologies.

4/12/2022,"The Australian Electoral Commission is investigating a Facebook page that is linked to a One Nation candidate and promotes candidates opposed to vaccination mandates. Join The Conversation is described as a community forum “that connects minor candidates with local voters”. However, its website and social media accounts appear to promote a catalogue of mostly One Nation and United Australia Party candidates who heavily oppose vaccination mandates. The Facebook page does not carry an authorisation statement required for political content from parties or candidates, despite a domain search for its associated website showing it is registered to One Nation candidate for Brisbane, Rebecca Lloyd, and a company called Fair Business Australia. The Fair Business Australia site was registered under Lloyd’s ABN last October and describes itself as a “bipartisan … alliance of small business owners, committed to freedom of choice” regarding vaccination status. Evan Ekin-Smyth, an AEC spokesperson, said electoral communication material, which includes social media accounts and websites, must have an authorisation statement so that voters can see who is responsible for them. Facebook posts generally do not require authorisation statements if the main account has one in its bio. Several Facebook posts on the Join The Conversation page have been authorised by Lloyd, however three advertisements on Facebook targeting Queenslanders did not include any authorisation. “😠Disillusioned with the Major Parties? 😠,” one active ad reads. “Join The Conversation is a community hub that connects minor candidates with local voters.” Ekin-Smyth said the commission would examine the Facebook page and advertisements. “There are potential civil penalties [for not including an authorisation statement] but our first port of call is always to get it corrected. “If it’s needed, we’d get in contact with them and ask them to apply one.” Guardian Australia contacted Lloyd and Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party seeking to confirm who was running the Join The Conversation website and social media pages. Instead, we received a statement from an email address called Join The Conversation which said the site was “not endorsed by any party, nor has it, or will it, receive funds of any kind from any political party.” The unnamed spokesperson also said its website and website hosting has “been generously gifted by a local small business owner who is not a member of any political party” and lists “candidates from all parties, except Labor, Liberal, Nationals and Greens”. A search of the site found it excludes several high-profile independent candidates, such as Jacqui Lambie, Zoe Daniel, Zali Steggall, Nick Xenophon, Jo Dyer, Helen Haines, Monique Ryan, Georgia Steele, Penny Ackery, Sophie Scamps and Linda Seymour, among others. Peter Cutforth identified himself as one of those responsible for building and hosting the website for free, but said he was not responsible for its content. “The JoinTheConversation website was built solely by myself and my team as a 100% donation from mid March to current date and ongoing. One of my companies also hosts the site pro bono,” he said in a Facebook comment. In a statement to Guardian Australia, Cutforth confirmed he was the owner of a web development agency that built the site as a donation to Join the Conversation but said he did not own the website itself. “I do not own the domain that is pointed to the website. Any content on the website has been placed there at the provision and direction of the owner,” he said. Cutforth did not answer questions about Lloyd’s involvement or whether he was aware that AEC was looking into the Facebook page and advertisements. “As I am not the owner of the site, and am merely a third-party website developer, I cannot make any other comment,” he said. Lloyd has cited Join The Conversation and Fair Business Australia – previously known as “No Vax Id” – on her Facebook and LinkedIn pages. Lloyd’s profile of the site says the former singer turned small business consultant stands for “ending all mandates and ensuring unelected bureaucrats never interfere with our freedoms again”. The site also includes an interview with Jason Miles, a Senate candidate for the Great Australian Party, who claims he does not support globalisation or “the current fluoridation of drinking water under current legislation”. The Join the Conversation website also includes a section soliciting donations to help fund candidates’ marketing activities. In examples of how donations would be spent, mock flyers for Rebecca Lloyd and another One Nation candidate are shown. Join The Conversation said it has “entered into a printing agreement with a commercial printer and all community donations will be equally shared amongst the freedom candidates”. “A full financial report of donations received and sent to the commercial printer will be readily and publicly available after the election,” they said.",News/Australia news,AEC to probe One Nation links to Facebook page promoting candidates who oppose vaccine mandates,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/aec-to-probe-one-nation-links-to-facebook-page-promoting-candidates-who-oppose-vaccine-mandates
4/12/2022,"The Queensland government has granted coordinated project status to a $4.7bn proposal to build a green hydrogen and ammonia plant in Gladstone, where climate transition plans are being pitched as saviour projects. The central Queensland city has endured a significant economic downturn since the end of an LNG construction boom about five years ago. But the deputy premier, Steven Miles, says Gladstone is on the way to becoming a “clean energy powerhouse” on the back of investment in new economy and climate transition projects. Mining billionaire Andrew Forrest is already building the world’s largest electrolyser factory in Gladstone. On Tuesday the Queensland government announced a streamlined approval process, overseen by the coordinator general, for the H2-Hub Gladstone project, which will produce green hydrogen and green ammonia. The green ammonia would be sold to mining explosives manufacturer Orica, which is working with the project proponent, H2U, on plans for an ammonia export terminal in Gladstone. Miles said the project could create more than 550 jobs during a phased construction and about 140 ongoing operational jobs. The project includes plans to build up to 3 gigawatts of electrolysis and produce up to 5,000 tonnes of green ammonia a day. It would be powered by 100% renewable energy, from new-build solar and wind in Queensland. State minister for regional development and Gladstone MP, Glenn Butcher, said central Queensland was becoming a significant site for renewables projects. “These partnerships are highlighting the benefits of investing into Queensland’s regions and creating jobs for the future,” Butcher said. Green hydrogen is made by running an electric current through water using an electrolyser powered by renewable energy such as wind or solar. Energy analysts have previously suggested green hydrogen was likely to leapfrog hydrogen made with gas and coal as the most cost-effective form of the energy before the end of the decade, and by the time an industry could be developed at scale. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Hydrogen has become central to the Australian government’s current proposal to reach net zero emissions. The government has nominated “clean hydrogen” as a priority low-emissions technology that could eventually help replace fossil fuels in transport, electricity and industrial processes as the world moves to cut greenhouse gas emissions. H2U is expected to make a final investment decision by mid-2023, with operations expected to begin in 2025 and an expansion toward the end of the decade.",News/Australia news,Queensland advances green hydrogen and ammonia project to be powered by renewables,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/queensland-advances-green-hydrogen-and-ammonia-project-to-be-powered-by-renewables
4/12/2022,"The Liberal National party senator Matt Canavan billed taxpayers thousands of dollars to fly with his family for a three-night trip to Brisbane, during which he headlined Christmas drinks for a controversial conservative group that planned to donate part of the night’s proceeds to him. Data released by the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (IPEA) on Friday shows Canavan and six family members travelled to Brisbane from Rockhampton in mid-November last year, costing taxpayers $3,676 in flights and unscheduled transport. Canavan says he was in Brisbane for legitimate parliamentary business, including for debates and community meetings, and to make a formal speech to the Australian Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, Christmas drinks event. Their trip coincided with the anti-vaccine mandate “freedom rally” in Brisbane on 20 November, but Canavan’s office told the Guardian neither he nor his family attended. Instead, his office said, Canavan was in Brisbane for a series of other events, including a debate and a community meeting on the Gold Coast. “Senator Canavan’s travel was for the purpose of his parliamentary business,” a spokesperson said. “Senator Canavan did not attend the freedom rally on 20 November. However, Senator Canavan had a busy schedule over this period attending a debate organised by the Australian Taxpayers Alliance, a community meeting on the Gold Coast, several meetings in Brisbane and was the guest speaker at the CPAC Christmas Party.” The Guardian is not suggesting Canavan wrongly claimed or misused his expense entitlements. The test Ipea uses is that the dominant purpose of an MP’s trip must be parliamentary or electorate business, and Canavan had legitimate parliamentary business in Brisbane. The CPAC event was ticketed, with Canavan as the headline speaker. About 20 paying VIP guests were entitled to a small “private dinner” with Canavan. “General Admission includes hearing Senator Matthew Canavan off the leash to a room of conservatives, as well as canapes and drinks, and a great night of relaxed networking with like-minded friends,” a promotional post on CPAC’s LinkedIn account said. “As always there is a very limited number of VIP tickets which include not only everything in the General Admission, but also reserved priority seating during the main event and a private dinner for just 20 people with our guest speaker. “A donation will be made to the speaker from the evening’s proceeds.” Canavan’s office initially told the Guardian neither he nor the LNP received any donations associated with the event. “The CPAC event was not a fundraiser for the LNP and no donations were received by Senator Canavan or the LNP from this event,” a spokesperson said. After being shown the CPAC LinkedIn post, the senator’s office made inquiries with the LNP to see whether a donation was in fact received. His spokesman subsequently said: “Senator Canavan had no expectation of receiving a donation from this event, and neither Senator Canavan, nor the LNP, has a record of donations from this event.” Canavan’s spokesperson said the senator’s family did not attend the event. CPAC is backed by the powerful American Conservative Union, and has been held in the US since 1974, when former US president Ronald Reagan gave the inaugural keynote speech. Organisers brought the conference to Australia in 2019, only its second such foray outside the US, promising it would “not be a one-off”. At the time, Labor described the event in parliament as a “talkfest of hate” and pushed for the government to block the visa of one of its speakers, former Breitbart editor Raheem Kassam.",News/Australia news,"Matt Canavan billed taxpayers for trip with family to Brisbane, where he spoke at CPAC dinner",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/matt-canavan-billed-taxpayers-for-trip-with-family-to-brisbane-where-he-spoke-at-cpac-dinner
4/12/2022,"Russia is receiving munitions and military hardware sourced from Iraq for its war effort in Ukraine with the help of Iranian weapons smuggling networks, according to members of Iranian-backed Iraqi militias and regional intelligence services with knowledge of the process. RPGs and anti-tank missiles, as well as Brazilian-designed rocket launcher systems, have been dispatched to Russia from Iraq as Moscow’s campaign has faltered in the last month, the Guardian has learned. An Iranian-made Bavar 373 missile system, similar to the Russian S-300, has also been donated to Moscow by the authorities in Tehran, who also returned an S-300, according to a source who helped organise the transport. Using the weapons-trafficking underworld would signal a dramatic shift in Russian strategy, as Moscow is forced to lean on Iran, its military ally in Syria, following new sanctions triggered by the invasion of Ukraine. The developments also have huge implications for the direction and volume of trade in the international weapons trafficking business. Iraq has hosted US and western troops since the 2003 overthrow of Saddam Hussein, and the US has trained and supplied various Iraqi army and special forces units to defend the Baghdad government against insurgencies. After two decades of war, the country is awash with weaponry. Much of it has passed legally into the hands of Iran-backed Shia militias, which are opposed to the US presence in the country, but since 2016 have been officially incorporated into the Iraqi armed forces as part of the fight against Islamic State. Known for their efficiency in dismantling Islamic State’s “caliphate” – and for their brutal treatment of Sunni civilians – these groups have become powerful actors in Iraq’s security establishment. RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades) and anti-tank missiles in the possession of Hashd al-Shaabi, the most powerful Shia militia umbrella, were transported to Iran through the Salamja border crossing on 26 March, where they were received by the Iranian military and taken on to Russia by sea, said a commander of the militia branch that controls the crossing. Ḥashd al-Shaabi also dismantled and sent in pieces two Brazilian-designed Astros II rocket launcher systems, known in Iraq as the licence-built version Sajil-60, to Iran on 1 April, according to a source within the organisation. “We don’t care where the heavy weapons go [because we don’t need them at the moment],” one Hashd al-Shaabi source said. “Whatever is anti-US makes us happy.” Three cargo ships capable of carrying such loads – two Russian flagged and one Iranian flagged – crossed the Caspian Sea from Iran’s port of Bandar Anzali to Astrakhan, a Russian city on the Volga delta, within the timeframes outlined. “What the Russians need in Ukraine right now is missiles. These require skill to transport as they’re fragile and explosive, but if you are committed to doing it, it’s possible,” said Yörük Işık, an Istanbul-based maritime affairs expert. “It’s also not the kind of activity that would be picked up by satellite imagery as they can be transported in large boxes and regular shipping containers.” Mohaned Hage Ali, a fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center, said: “That kind of sophisticated weaponry [rocket launcher systems] would make a big difference on the ground in Ukraine. Ḥashd al-Shaabi controls much of the border region with Iran, which would make this transaction easier. “Other countries such as China are having to be very careful about giving weapons to Russia now, given the new sanctions situation. And Iran, as part of that axis, wants to make sure Russia doesn’t lose ground in this conflict. “If the Putin regime is destabilised that has huge implications for Iran, particularly in Syria, where Damascus is dependent on Russian air support and Russia coordinates to avoid direct conflict between them and Israel.” Extensive economic sanctions imposed on Moscow by western nations since the 24 February invasion have included bans on dual-use goods – items with a civilian and a military purpose – such as spare parts for vehicles and certain types of electronics and optical devices, as well as items with obvious military uses. Russian manufacturers have reportedly been hit hard by the new restrictions, with Ukraine saying that the country’s main armoured vehicle plant, as well as a tractor factory, have run out of parts for making and repairing tanks. Revised western estimates are that 29 of Russia’s original battalion tactical groups are now “combat non-ineffective” from an invading force that is estimated at 125 battalions, or about 75% of Russia’s total army, in the six-week-old “special military operation”. The significant losses have yielded few gains: Moscow for now appears to have abandoned its initial attempt to seize the capital, Kyiv, instead drawing down and repositioning its ground forces for a renewed assault on the Donbas region, in the south-east of the country. Airstrikes and artillery assaults are expected to continue on the cities of Kharkiv and Mykolaiv as well as the besieged port of Mariupol. Last week, the Ukrainian intelligence services accused Georgia of helping Russia receive sanctioned military materiel, in another potential sign of the scale of the Kremlin’s new efforts to use international smuggling networks to aid its campaign in Ukraine. Georgian special services received instructions from the country’s political leadership not to interfere with smuggling channels from “east Asia” designed to circumvent new western sanctions, Kyiv’s intelligence directorate said in a statement. Georgian officials said the Ukrainian claims were baseless. Relations between the two post-Soviet nations have sharply deteriorated since the conflict broke out over the pro-Russian government in Tbilisi’s refusal to impose economic sanctions on Moscow. US officials have also said that Russia has asked China for military-grade weapons and aid in support of its Ukraine operation. Russian ally Serbia took the delivery of a Chinese anti-aircraft system in a secretive operation over the weekend, the Associated Press reported, amid western concerns of an arms buildup in the Balkans at the same time as the war in Ukraine which could threaten the fragile peace in the region.",News/World news,Russia ‘using weapons smuggled by Iran from Iraq against Ukraine’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/russia-using-weapons-smuggled-by-iran-from-iraq-against-ukraine
