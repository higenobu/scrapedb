3/17/2022,"New South Wales government MPs and local mayors have lined up to blast the federal government over the decision to exclude some flood-hit areas from disaster funding. One upper house Liberal party MP, Catherine Cusack, has announced her intention to resign from politics altogether, telling Guardian Australia her decision was not a protest but “me not wanting to fight the machine any more”. Cusack’s resignation bombshell comes following the federal government’s decision to exclude some northern rivers communities from extra flood relief funding. Scott Morrison last week announced extra financial support would be available for people in Lismore, Richmond Valley and Clarence Valley local areas. The disaster recovery funding included $2,000 per person, and $800 for children. Those regions all sit in the federal seat of Page, held by the Nationals. But other local government areas including Ballina, Byron and Tweed – all located in the electorate of Richmond, held by Labor – were excluded from receiving the extra funds. That has prompted outrage from Liberal and National MPs in the NSW government. Cusack, an outspoken upper house MP who represents the north coast, said she had informed the party’s state director of her intention to resign as soon as the party was able to hold a preselection for her position. “I am so tired of it,” she said. “I don’t want to spend all day attacking and sounding bitter. I am not bitter – I just don’t fit into the new Liberal party culture and it drained all my energy trying.” “It’s an enormous relief to step away from it.” While initial reports suggested Cusack would immediately quit, she told Guardian Australia she would wait until local branch members were able to vote for her replacement, both out of respect for her colleagues and to ensure “a constitutional preselection”. “You may have noticed the Liberal Party finding it difficult to have a constitutional preselection even for federal seats,” she said. Cusack is not the only government MP furious with the federal government’s decision to exclude some areas from the extra funding. The NSW Nationals MP for Tweed, Geoff Provest, told local ABC radio he had lost faith in Morrison, saying he was “disgusted with the prime minister”. “I just think the federal government has really messed this up … I can put it no other way, they’ve lost the faith of the people,” he said. “Whether in the caravan parks or one of the little villages, there’s a real venom out there directed at the prime minister that he doesn’t understand what’s occurring on the ground. This is like a remake of the bushfires some two years ago.” He said the decision to exclude residents in his seat and neighbouring Ballina was “deplorable”. “You just have to drive around the area to talk to the people to see they’ve lost everything,” he said. “The federal government is disconnected with the good people of Australia and we’re paying the price for it here … I think they should hang their heads in shame.” In neighbouring Ballina, held by Greens MP Tamara Smith, which was also devastated by the flood waters, there is similar anger. “I’m furious,” Smith said. “We’re all so distracted by the needs of thousands of people who need housing and schools fixed, all the logistics of the recovery, and then this – it’s just cruel,” she said. “It has pitted the community against each other in a way that is so at odds with what is happening in the community where everyone is working together and being amazing.” There were also reports on Wednesday of frustration inside the NSW government over the delay in federal signoff for an additional $1.4bn in flood supports because of the prime minister’s campaigning trip to Western Australia. Morrison said the NSW flood package request was going through the “normal process” after the request had come to the federal government, and had been assessed by the national security committee of cabinet on Wednesday. “We work closely with state governments, but when you’re talking about the investments of hundreds of millions of dollars and indeed, billions now, then I think that people would expect this to go through the proper assessment of the proposals which we did yesterday at the national security committee of cabinet.” “I’d advised the premier that that is what we’d be doing and then getting back to him as soon as possible.” Morrison said more than $1bn had already been paid to people in flood-affected areas of NSW and Queensland to more than a million people. However a senior federal government spokesperson rejected suggestions the funding announcement was being delayed for political purposes. On Thursday, the NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, also said he was not aware of a delay in the funding because of the WA trip. “We’re working through a process with the prime minister’s office and the federal government,” Kean said. “We’ve already got a billion dollars out the door that we’ve already announced in conjunction with the federal government and we’re working through some additional support packages for those who need it most. So it’s not an unusual process.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Asked whether he agreed with the decision to exclude some local government areas from additional funding, Kean conceded the “existing framework” for disaster relief needed to be worked around. “This is unique, this event, [because] some of the people that have been hit do not meet the existing criteria in place, which is why we need to tailor additional financial support packages to help those people that have been left out,” he said. “We’re working through that process that needs to be negotiated. This is not unusual. And what I can say is that the federal government, including the prime minister’s office and the treasurer’s office, has been working very constructively with us to help ensure those communities get that money as soon as possible.” In a statement, a spokesperson for the prime minister’s office said the extra funding proposal was still being considered by the federal government’s recovery agency, after which it needed to be signed off by the departments of treasury and finance. It was unlikely to go to the expenditure review committee in an effort to fast-track approval. “The NSW government’s proposal documentation was received this [Wednesday] morning by the National Recovery and Resilience Agency and is under urgent consideration by the Commonwealth Government to ensure it meets both governments’ objectives to deliver immediate and longer term relief and support,” he said.” “The Commonwealth Government hopes to finalise the details of the additional support very shortly.”",News/Australia news,‘Really messed this up’: government MPs blast flood disaster funding as one prepares to quit,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/17/really-messed-this-up-government-mps-blast-flood-disaster-funding-as-one-prepares-to-quit
3/17/2022,"One of the world’s leading coral scientists claims a sixth mass bleaching event is unfolding across the Great Barrier Reef, with official monitoring flights now under way all along the Queensland coastline. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) has confirmed monitoring flights are being conducted “along the length and breadth” of the 2,300km world heritage reef. But the authority is not due to make a formal update on conditions over the reef, or the initial findings from those flights, until Friday. The development comes less than a week before the start of a 10-day United Nations monitoring mission to the reef ahead of a crucial meeting of the world heritage committee in June. Prof Terry Hughes, a leading expert on coal bleaching at James Cook University, said he had received a “flood of reports from the field” of bleached corals in the last two weeks. Rising ocean temperatures driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases have caused five mass bleaching events along the reef in 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020. Hughes told the Guardian he believes a sixth mass bleaching event is now unfolding, and that it was not mild or local. The amount of heat stress over the reef tends to peak in early to mid-March each year but scientists began to worry as early as December after water temperatures rose to record levels for that month. Hughes said: “We all breathed a sigh of relief because corals that were pale in December regained their colour in January and February. But in the last three weeks there have been reports of moderate to strong bleaching all along the reef.” Observations from the Bureau of Meteorology show water temperatures at between 1C and 2C above average across wide areas of the reef. Tragically, coral bleaching is now widespread again on the #GreatBarrierReef after an end-of-summer heatwave. The 6th event since 1998 appears to be unfolding.It’s a cry for help - Just in time for @UNESCO and ⁦@IUCN⁩’s mission. https://t.co/OJ0QRZOILz A study, led by Hughes, has found more than 98% of all the individual reefs have bleached at least once. During the last three mass bleaching events, Hughes has led aerial surveys across the length of the marine park to record the condition of corals from a low-flying aircraft. Hughes said that task had now been passed on to GBRMPA. He said water temperatures and the accumulated heat stress alone was not enough to say for sure if corals had bleached. “We won’t have a full picture until the flights are done,” he said. “We have to see those maps [of bleaching] so it is premature to say how this ranks next to the other five bleaching events.” GBRMPA has been collating information on bleaching from flights, in-water surveillance and reports for weeks. A week ago the authority said there had been “low to moderate bleaching” reported in many areas. In a statement on Thursday, the authority said it was “conducting aerial surveys along the length and breadth of the reef, to get a clearer picture of any bleaching in the Marine Park this summer. The status of reef health is updated each Friday.” Flights began last weekend. The Australian Institute of Marine Science has previously said a recovery in coral cover over the reef since the last bleaching event in 2020 has been driven by fast-growing acropora corals that were also susceptible to bleaching. Hughes said northern parts of the reef were “halfway to recovery” but a lot of “vulnerable corals” were now bleaching. Corals can recover from mild bleaching, but if heat stress is too severe the coral can die. While there is no formal definition of a mass bleaching event, Hughes said: “Most people would describe bleaching that includes severe levels of bleaching at a scale of hundreds of kilometres would qualify as a mass bleaching.” Last week, environment groups said it was vital that a UN mission to the reef – requested by Australia and starting on Monday – should be able to see bleaching. No details have been released either by Unesco or the Australian government about where the mission will go or who it will meet. A report from the mission is expected by early May ahead of a scheduled world heritage committee meeting in June. Last year, UN science advisors recommended the committee place the reef on a list of world heritage sites “in danger” because of the impacts of bleaching and a lack of progress in improving pollution levels. But fierce lobbying by the Australian government saw the 21-country committee ignore the recommendation. During the meeting, Australia also sided with countries to go against several UN recommendations relating to other sites around the world. Australia reportedly struck at least one quid pro quo – a deal with Spain to back a world heritage inscription for a site in Madrid, despite UN advisors opposing it, in exchange for Spain’s support to block an “in danger” listing for the reef. Last month the Morison government pledged a further $1bn for local reef conservation efforts over the next nine years. But many reef scientists have said efforts like finding more heat-tolerant coral species, improving water quality and removing coral-eating starfish will be overrun by global heating unless greenhouse gas emissions are cut rapidly.",News/Environment,"Great Barrier Reef hit by sixth mass bleaching event, leading coral scientist says ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/17/great-barrier-reef-hit-by-sixth-mass-bleaching-event-leading-coral-scientist-says
