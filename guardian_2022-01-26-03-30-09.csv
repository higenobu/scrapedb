1/26/2022,"A 25-year-old Black man sued two Nevada police departments for wrongfully detaining him in jail, after mistaking him for a white suspect twice his age. On 8 January 2020, Shane Lee Brown was driving in Henderson, Nevada, when he was stopped by police. According to his lawsuit, Brown did not have photographic identification but provided his name and his social security number and card.  When the officers ran a record check under “Shane Brown”, an outstanding felony warrant for a firearm charge appeared. However, the charge was for Shane Neal Brown who, according to the lawsuit, was a 5ft 1in, 49-year-old white man with brown hair and a white beard. In addition to being 26 years younger, Shane Lee Brown was Black with black hair and stood 5ft 7in. Officers allegedly ignored repeated explanations about the mistaken identity and detained the younger man. Transferred to Clark county detention center two days later, Brown tried to explain the mix-up to officers with Las Vegas Metropolitan Police. But “despite being informed of this mistaken identity”, the lawsuit said, “none of the unknown LVMPD police or LVMPD corrections officers bothered to review [their] own records to determine whether Shane Lee Brown was the subject of the warrant. “Had any of the LVMPD police or corrections officers performed any due diligence, such as comparing Shane Lee Brown’s booking photo against the existing mugshot belonging to the white ‘Shane Brown’ named in the warrant, they would have easily determined that Shane Lee Brown has been misidentified as the subject of the warrant.” On 14 January, Judge Joe Hardy of Clark county district court confirmed at a hearing that Shane Lee Brown was not Shane Neal Brown – and released him. In addition to punitive damages, the lawsuit seeks damages of $500,000 under federal law and at least $50,000 under state law. Henderson police maintained that Brown’s arrest was lawful, as he was arrested for driving with a suspended license and failure to pay a warrant issued by Henderson municipal court. “The plaintiff in this lawsuit has not presented all the facts and circumstances behind his lawful and proper arrest by Henderson police, which will be further addressed in the city attorney’s response to the court,” the police department said. E Brent Bryson, Brown’s attorney, told ABC News that Brown told the police officers he was aware of his violations and had set a court date to address them. “They were going to let him go, except for the fact that when they ran [his name], it pulled up the wrongful bench warrant for the white Shane Brown,” Bryson said. “From one standpoint, yes, they could have arrested him … rightfully … for traffic. He was wrongfully detained and arrested, however, for the warrant out of the [Las Vegas metropolitan area] for the felony possession of a firearm.”",News/US news,Black man mistaken for white suspect twice his age sues police over arrest,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/25/nevada-police-black-man-detained-mistaken-white-suspect
1/26/2022,"Simon Jenkins (Britain should stay well out of Russia’s border dispute with Ukraine, 20 January) claims that Russia’s “border disputes” with Ukraine have “nothing whatsoever to do with Britain” – but it has everything to do with the more than 20,000 diaspora Ukrainians and Britons of Ukrainian descent who live in the UK, of whom I am one. Mr Jenkins appears to be of the opinion that Ukrainian sovereignty is less important than the desire of those who govern Russia not to be humiliated on the international stage. This is incorrect. Ukraine is not and has never been an integral part of Russia: it is an independent nation with a separate language, history and religious and political traditions. It was, for centuries, under the colonial rule of Tsarist Russia (or the Habsburg empire, depending on the region) and then of the Soviet Union, suffered unspeakably at the hands of the Soviet government in the 1930s and was subjected to extreme cultural suppression in the 19th century.  It is inexpressibly disappointing and hurtful to see that in 2022 there are Guardian columnists who have apparently bought into 19th-century Russian imperial propaganda.Christopher JotischkyLancaster  As an MEP in the 1990s, serving as vice-chair of the joint parliamentary committee with Poland, and attending meetings with representatives of other applicant states to the EU. I discussed with them why they also wished to join Nato, and tried to dissuade them. But they were clear that membership of Nato would protect them from again falling under Russian rule. Ukraine did not at that time apply for EU membership, but sent observers to joint meetings. I felt then that it was not wise to move too far to the east, but rather to build up good relationships with former Soviet states. I chaired a session at a local government conference for applicant states in Warsaw, and observers from Ukraine were keenly interested in developments being worked towards in Poland and other neighbouring states. On another occasion in Strasbourg I addressed a group of Ukrainian farmers about reform of the common agricultural policy; they seemed cheered at what I said about the need for reform. I give these as examples that already in the mid-1990s there were people in Ukraine looking west rather than east to Russia, with a view to developing a more open democratic society. This was not being pushed on them by the EU, which was not behaving triumphantly, but created a funding stream to help former Soviet states, including Russia, to develop democratic institutions.Veronica HardstaffSheffield  Simon Jenkins writes (24 January) of Nato’s post-cold-war expansion eastwards as though it was an invasion and occupation rather than a free choice by independent sovereign nations. That is also the reason why Ukraine seeks to join Nato; it is an independent, sovereign country with a distinct identity that wishes to find its own way in the world. Jenkins’ alternative – a grandiloquent world of “spheres of influence” – would have Ukraine permanently subservient to Russia. This year is the 100th anniversary of Irish independence. For those, like Jenkins, who find it difficult to understand why a country like Ukraine might wish to chart its own course, let him look over the Irish Sea at a close historical parallel. Or look north to Scotland, whose independence disappeared between 1603 and 1707, but whose sense of self, and now desire for self-determination, has not disappeared.Our support for Ukraine should be loud, unequivocal and unlimited: freedom is indivisible.Simon DigginsRetired colonel, Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire",News/World news,Ukraine’s independence must be supported by Britain | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/ukraines-independence-must-be-supported-by-britain

1/26/2022,"Ivory Coast’s meeting with Egypt on Wednesday may only be the last 16, but it is a game that has a climactic feel. It’s 14 years since they last met competitively, but memories of that game remain fresh. The image of Amr Zaki turning sharply in the box in that Cup of Nations semi-final, sending Kolo Touré running in the wrong direction as he powered by to score stands as the defining one of Egypt’s period of dominance when they won three Cups of Nations in a row under Hassan Shehata. Egypt won 4-1, a crushing victory over the Ivorian golden generation. That was a brilliant side, defensively ruthless with a fleet of creative midfielders – Ahmed Hassan, Mohamed Aboutreika, Osama Hosny – and in each tournament a striker who hit form just at the right time. Shehata’s side were also mentally tough: victory in Ghana in 2008 was the first time a North African side had won a Cup of Nations in sub-Saharan Africa, a feat they repeated in Angola two years later.  The present squad may have the best player Egypt has produced, one of the best players in the world, in Mohamed Salah, but it has nothing like the same depth of quality. Progress through World Cup qualifying – they face Senegal in a play-off in March – has been functional. Away from home, playing on the break, they were able to open up a little, but just four goals scored in three home games felt underwhelming, as did their coach Carlos Queiroz’s reluctance to be bullish about Egypt’s chances at the Cup of Nations. From his days coaching Portugal’s youth sides 30 years ago, Queiroz has favoured a cautious, possession-driven approach. That hasn’t changed in Cameroon. Egypt had the sixth-most possession in the group stage but only the 11th-most shots. Every game finished 1-0 – a defeat to Nigeria and wins over Guinea-Bissau and Sudan – a plodding qualification that has only increased the criticism of Queiroz, who has started to demonstrate frustration, dismissing a “kick the ball forward, kick the ball forward” approach. For him the biggest issue has not been the general play but the finishing, and that despite the presence not only of Salah but also of Omar Marmoush of Stuttgart and Mostafa Mohamed of Galatasaray. “Look, I promise you starting they are going to be doing finishing exercises from the morning until the afternoon,” Queiroz said after the win over Sudan. “They just need to score more goals. To only play good football is not enough – we need to build up more goals and with that be more relaxed in the game. We always have intention to score and it only takes one small mistake, one rebound, and something can happen.” That Mohamed El-Shenawy was named best goalkeeper of the first phase is a double-edged compliment. Yes, he has been impressive, but in that group Egypt would have hoped he didn’t need to be. Certainly Egypt’s goalkeeping situation is a lot less complicated than Ivory Coast’s. Having lost their first-choice Sylvain Gbohouo, when he failed a doping test in the week before the tournament (Ivory Coast have said he was prescribed medication by a doctor), their second choice Badra Ali Sangaré then suffered the death of his father the morning after the second group game, in which he had gifted Sierra Leone an equaliser when his knee plugged in the dreadful Douala pitch. Sangaré insisted on playing in the final group game, though, and excelled in the 3-1 win over the reigning champions Algeria in the final group game in what was by far Ivory Coast’s best performance in the competition so far. With Arsenal’s Nicolas Pépé excelling on the right of a fluid front three, the Ivorian trio of Jean Michaël Seri, Franck Kessié and Ibrahim Sangaré dominated against an Algerian midfield that capitulated for a crucial period just after half-time. That was a surprising failing from the African champions – if one they had also suffered late on against Equatorial Guinea – and it’s hard to imagine a Queiroz side collapsing in the same way. “The game will be a tactical one,” said the Ivory Coast manager Patrice Beaumelle, “and we have a plan to stop the danger our opponent poses.” So far, with Egypt offering little in the way of creativity, that has essentially meant stopping Salah. But stopping Queiroz’s side has rarely been the issue for opponents; the problem is being stopped by them. If Ivory Coast’s midfield can impose themselves as they did against Algeria, then there should be chances again for Pépé, Sébastien Haller and Max Gradel. If not, the likelihood is for a tight, tense game that will be settled by one of Queiroz’s small mistakes or rebounds. That may not be how Egypt fans want to play, but it is how Queiroz has always done it.",Sport/Football,Ivory Coast v Egypt has a climactic feel but don’t expect the goals of 2008 | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/25/ivory-coast-v-egypt-has-a-climactic-feel-but-dont-expect-the-goals-of-2008
1/26/2022,"Aziz Ansari’s career has been dramatically carved in two since the sexual misconduct allegations made against him four years ago, which he denied. Before: a slick and optimistic comic with the world at his feet. After: an ever more downbeat and cynical act appraising how “shitty” we all are – especially as regards our hunger for celebrity gossip. Ansari’s new special Nightclub Comedian is the third of his shows that I’ve seen since the accusations, and the third that encodes in one routine after another (and even in a joke we hear performed by the preceding act) his unresolved feelings about the episode. Perhaps that’s understandable. There’s an argument that Ansari’s trial-by-public-opinion even enriched his comedy with colours that just weren’t there before. Nightclub Comedian’s 29 minutes have more considered social commentary than many acts manage in twice the duration. In a section on misinformation, which both mocks and deplores the mocking of vaccine sceptics, there’s a wicked routine envisaging the rapper Ice Cube having a colonoscopy. A strong closer – responding to anti-vaxxers’ fears of coming under microchip control – notes how robotically enslaved we already are to our smartphones.  But it’s a world-weary show – the more so for the contrast drawn with Ansari’s younger self, footage of whom is intercut arriving at the same venue 20 years ago. The New York crowd is berated for squandering the idealistic energy that voted out Trump – which feels harsh, not least because Ansari now lives in London. This sit-down rather than standup special purports to show our host humbly reconnecting with no-frills club comedy, in contrast (he suggests) to the corporate empire-building of the likes of Kevin Hart. But this is humility as performed for Netflix, so claims to a newfound modesty ring hollow. Then there are the gags – notably, the one imagining Timothée Chalamet exposed to public disgrace for an incident with an Asian man and some bubble tea – that seem to address all over again Ansari’s own travails. It’s another glimpse, then, of a comic with technique and intelligence to spare – but not the slightest vestige of the gilded good cheer of old.

1/26/2022,"Fifa should tighten its proposed rules on intermediaries to limit the money made by super-agents, the influential Council of Europe will be told on Wednesday. A cap on the amount agents can make in any transaction and on the service fees they can charge are among the ideas to be put forward, alongside the creation of a solidarity system that would see money filter from the biggest clubs in Europe to smaller leagues and teams.  The recommendations form part of a report by the council’s committee on culture, science, education and media into football governance which, if adopted, would see the council broadly endorse the new rules while setting absolute limits on the money an agent can make on any deal. Fifa is trying to implement its reforms in the face of stern opposition from top agents. Lord Foulkes, who sits on the committee, will make the proposals on Wednesday, with Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, in attendance at a session of the council’s parliamentary assembly. Foulkes is set to be highly critical of the current system. A draft version of the report to be put in front of the assembly said that the transfer market, despite its “fundamental importance” to the football industry, had created a mechanism where “huge sums circulate among the elite clubs in a solipsistic economy of limited circulation of resources”. In his report, Foulkes says that the need for agents to have “fair and reasonable” earnings must be matched against “avoiding conflicts of interest, protecting the players, avoiding pressure towards contractual instability and preventing abusive, excessive and speculative practices”. Therefore, he writes: “I believe we must insist in asking that all commissions and fees paid to agents are capped, registered, disclosed and monitored.” This would include capping the absolute amount payable to an agent acting on behalf of a selling club, with a suggested limit of $10m (£7.4m). Although the report is largely supportive of Fifa’s transfer reforms it does criticise the governing body in other areas, calling for the abandonment of plans for a biennial World Cup. The report also affirms ongoing opposition to the idea of a European Super League and calls for greater protection for the safety and rights of minors within the game. The Council of Europe is an international organisation comprised of 47 member states, including the UK, which exists to champion “human rights, democracy and the rule of law”. If the report submitted by Foulkes is approved by the parliamentary assembly, and a subsequent vote by a council of ministers, member governments will be expected to lobby for its implementation. Fifa is soliciting responses from around the game on the third version of its proposed reforms, with feedback expected to continue until the end of the month. It remains hopeful of implementing the rules this year. The Football Forum, an organisation created by the agents Mino Raiola, Jorge Mendes and Jonathan Barnett to “implement and develop the best professional practice of football agency”, has spoken out against the reforms. It was approached by the Guardian for comment.",Sport/Football,Fifa urged to tighten rules on money super-agents make from transfers,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/25/fifa-urged-to-tighten-rules-on-money-super-agents-make-from-transfers
1/26/2022,"Dear New Zealand, Kia ora!  I guess by now you have received Omicron, the unwanted visitor that we in Australia hosted over the Christmas season (and beyond – the guest that stayed all summer!). No doubt you have been busy preparing for this guest – extending your isolation requirements, promoting booster shots and tightening restrictions. But a crucial form of preparation is the one you do in your head. Going from having very few Covid cases to thousands of cases a day in the community is a mental shift that is hard to prepare for – but having just had a summer of Omicron, I’m writing to tell you what may await. I’m not writing to instruct you – just to offer some solidarity, the advice I wish I’d been given, a glimpse from the immediate future. The first thing that happens is that you start to know people who become contacts. They get pinged after checking in somewhere where there was a Covid case and suddenly dinner plans or a weekend away is cancelled. Then it’s your turn. You’ll probably get an alert from somewhere unmemorable – like the time you ducked into the supermarket for a carton of milk. And then quite dramatically, a week after the first ping – your phone will go nuts with contact alerts. At least that’s what happened early on in Sydney. Hopefully you’ll be able get tested if you get pinged, but if you are unlucky, you’ll be in a situation where it’s difficult to get tested. This is the first mental challenge: the possibility of exposure to the virus and then the inability to get tested and know if you have it or not. In Australia, when Omicron arrived, the politicians’ mantra was “personal responsibility”. This can add to the mental load of dealing with the outbreak. How can you take personal responsibility if you can’t get tested? How to keep yourself sane, and others safe, if the state is unprepared? This virus is wildly infectious – and personal responsibility is not going to cut it. The next challenge is how to carry on your daily life when you and everyone you know is getting pinged. In Australia the settings for isolation were in flux. But you should be prepared to exit society for a period of time due to health orders. For us, this meant the possibility of missing Christmas or being unable to travel in the summer holidays to visit friends and family in parts of the country that were previously off limits. You may have dropped your guard and are just wanting to return to normal after almost two years of the pandemic. We understand the pain of uncertainty over here. After long lockdowns in Melbourne and Sydney, and children denied almost two full years of education, we crave certainty more than ever. But sadly this summer has not provided it. This phase of the virus is far from normal. It’s hard. Your friends and family will all have different levels of comfort being in the community around this time. Do not be surprised if your social life evaporates. People will go into self-imposed lockdown, preferring to wait out the Omicron wave in their homes rather than risk catching the virus. Be understanding and without judgment if somebody has a different capacity for risk than yourself. Keeping sane in this Omicron summer was different for everyone. Some people felt more secure withdrawing and keeping socialising to a minimum, others cancelled holidays and trips away. I moved the bulk of my socialising outside. It didn’t feel quite normal – but what does? This summer we occupied the strange twilight world of not-quite-lockdowns: takeaway food and picnics in the park, food shortages and cafe closures, empty supermarket shelves and scary headlines about case numbers and overstretched ICUs. But there was also the beach, and hot nights in Melbourne drinking in outdoor bars. It was all a bit surreal, to be honest. The third mental challenge is actually knowing people who have it. Like us, you’ve probably gone from being able to name many of your country’s Covid cases (we had “barbecue guy”, the “Sydney removalists” and the “limo driver”) to people you know testing positive for Covid. Six months ago this would have been very dramatic – but Omicron is not particularly exclusive and at its peak, many thousands of people a day catch it. But the first case among your circle can cause alarm. Will they be OK? What should you do to help? Have you caught it from them? The best thing to do here is not to freak out and help them through their illness by getting them groceries and helping them (via phone/text) monitor their symptoms. At the start of January, a wedding I attended turned out to be a super-spreader event. We all thankfully recovered. Much of the stress of this week while sick was being unable to secure a Covid test. Hopefully your government has used the extra time they’ve had to ensure that everyone who needs a test has one. The next mental challenge is when cases really begin to multiply and you see the effects of isolation and illness on broader society. Who really holds our society together? Omicron will tell you. It’s our hospital staff and paramedics, and people who work in supply chains, warehouses, abattoirs, on the docks, in restaurants, cafes and supermarkets. One day your town will be business as usual, and the next, after a wave has swept through, shops and cafes will be shut, supermarket shelves will be empty or sparse, local flights will be cancelled and you won’t be able to get an Uber for love or money. This is alarming because the disruptions allow you to actually see Omicron, and the havoc it creates. Just keep calm, don’t stockpile more than you need, and adapt to the new circumstances. It lasts no longer than a few weeks. The next challenge is when you wake up with a scratchy throat and a dry cough. After playing dodgeball with the virus for all these years, suddenly you think you might have it. But unless you have an underlying health issue, for the majority of vaccinated people this is also no cause for alarm. Stay home unless you’re going out for a test, and look after yourself. For many people, the worst passes within a week. But as we are seeing in Australia, hospitalisations and deaths do rise with the increase in cases. The reality is not everyone recovers quickly. So be calm, kind and try not to panic. This too shall pass.

1/26/2022,"A birthday party was held for prime minister Boris Johnson with cake and singing in the cabinet room on 19 June 2020, it emerged on Monday, with up to 30 staff present for Johnson’s 56th birthday under lockdown restrictions. At the time, indoor gatherings were banned and pubs, restaurants and hairdressers remained shuttered. Meet-ups outdoors were capped at six people.  The Metropolitan police announced on Tuesday it would be investigating the string of alleged Downing Street parties, after notification from Sue Gray the senior civil servant leading the inquiry into Downing Street parties.Four people speak about birthday celebrations spent under tight lockdown restrictions. “I spent the day feeling so upset for her,” said Cathy Grafton about her mother, Kathleen, who turned 96 on 15 May 2020, the day the prime minister was pictured during a wine and cheese garden gathering at Downing Street. After testing positive for Covid in her care home, Kathleen was “alone, in isolation and bed-ridden” on her birthday. Grafton, who is a retired social worker from Whitstable, said the latest allegations brought all her anger back. “It’s taken me over the edge,” said the 67-year-old. “It’s like I can’t get closure because I keep getting reminded of how people like Boris Johnson were just ignoring the restrictions, when we, the public, were following the rules and making so many sacrifices. “Mum died in August 2020 and I can only imagine that she was very lonely, sad and depressed. We didn’t get a proper funeral. That’s not the death you want for your mother.” She feels the prime minister should “pay the ultimate price [of resigning] for his arrogance”. “I’m still incandescent with rage. He should be setting an example to people not walking all over them,” she said. “Some MPs are still defending him and asking why we need to keep talking about all these parties. We need to because they’re the epitome of everything that’s gone wrong.” Gail Head, whose son has a pre-existing health condition, was planning a big party for him on 18 April 2020. The previous three years, her son’s poor health had prevented a celebration with lots of school friends. But, for his 12th birthday, he was well enough to push the boat out. Fourteen children were invited to a Warhammer store to build, paint, play and eat pizza. “He was very excited, he’d put a lot of work into organising the party,” Head, 54, of Maidenhead, said. “He’d designed some invites himself” – comic book style – “printed them out on the computer and given them out to his friends.” But the party would never go ahead because of lockdown restrictions. On the day itself he was at home with his parents. The big party was replaced by a Zoom call with Head’s sister and his grandparents. There were moments of happiness, but “he was very subdued,” Head said. “We’d made him a lovely cake, and when he was cutting it he was quite upset. It was the first time he’d ever had a birthday cake with just the three of us.” Johnson’s seeming lack of regret irks Head most. “If it was any other prime minister, you would be so shocked that you wouldn’t be able to speak,” she said. “But the history of lies and obfuscations and apologies that aren’t actually apologies, it actually starts to not shock any more – and that’s worse.” On 7 June 2020, the same month Johnson celebrated his 56th birthday in Downing Street, Debbie Malpas’s son James celebrated his 17th birthday in their damp garden. “It was a bit miserable, it was grey skies, and then just after we began to eat it started to rain,” Maplas, 53, said. “It certainly didn’t cross our minds to do something inside.” Malpas and guests ordered pizza, ate chocolate cake with sprinkles and talked under one parasol and two umbrellas. James’s sister sat half in the doorway to avoid getting wet. The event stuck to the rule of six – James’s parents, sister and two friends – the rules for outdoor gatherings at the time. “It was a pretty dull birthday for a 17-year-old,” Malpas, from Cambridgeshire, said. But given how friends had missed out on all celebrations between March and June, “it felt pretty luxurious to be able to do anything.” Less than two weeks later, Johnson’s alleged 30-person gathering in the cabinet room was said to have taken place. When Malpas read the news, “you just roll your eyes and go, ‘Oh, it’s just another one,’” she said. “I don’t think it was a surprise, it was just confirmation of what we all guessed was happening.” In the run up to his 50th birthday on 24 April 2020, David Welsh told his wife, Heather Armond, he didn’t want to celebrate amid so much death. “This is wrong, even in some kind of minimalist way,” he told her. “It feels obscene.” She was reluctant, but agreed – there would be no fancy meal at home, no bottle of wine, not even a card. “I found myself just disgusted and traumatised by the sheer number of people who were dying,” Welsh said. “The horrific toll that you’d hear in those ghastly press conferences day after day.” At the time, government data shows, the seven-day average was about 800 people dying with Covid a day. Welsh, who is an executive career coach, spent the day at home in London like any other. “Sitting at my kitchen table working away like everybody else.” He ate his typical lunch of soup, bread and fruit. Then while he was watching that day’s Covid briefing, “I just suddenly remembered to myself, ‘Oh, it’s your birthday,’” Welsh said. “And then I just let it slip by.” So when news broke of the prime minister’s parties during strict lockdowns, Welsh was angry. “The sheer brazenness of it was surprising,” he said. “And then we found it he was throwing a birthday party a few weeks after mine, it was really insulting. I said to my wife: ‘This is fucking embarrassing.’”",News/World news,‘Alone and bedridden’: how four people celebrated their birthdays during lockdown,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/alone-and-bedridden-how-four-people-celebrated-their-birthdays-during-lockdown
1/26/2022,"When Thierry Mugler finally permitted a museum to curate a retrospective of his work, it showed his exceptionally shapely contribution to fashion. The exhibition, which opened in Montreal, Canada, in 2019 and transferred last September to the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, was all about three-dimensional bodies with strong command and control, dressed to stress their voluptuousness and power. Even the photographs looked like sculptures. He did goddesses, empresses and superheroines. No gamines, waifs or ordinary women.  For a decade from the early 1980s, Mugler, who has died aged 73, was a definer of the mood of the mode in extravagant ensembles, and even more in his staging. Paris couture had ventured out into catwalk presentation in the 70s, but Mugler introduced celebrity guests, big performances, filmed inserts and amplification borrowed from stadium rock concerts, for entertainment rather than to shift clothes; 6,000 Parisians bought tickets for his 1984 spectacle at the Zenith, the city’s biggest arena. Mugler’s designs connected with the capital’s cabaret tradition – later picked up by Broadway and Hollywood – of costuming showgirls as highly sexualised abstractions – woman as bird, animal, insect, car hood ornament. Musicians recognised that a Mugler outfit could astonish an audience at a first entrance. “You can wear a uniform,” sang David Bowie in Boys Keep Swinging, 1979, and one of the uniforms he wore for its music video was a pink dress by Mugler. Diana Ross, Madonna and Celine Dion commissioned stage costumes from him; he tussled with George Michael for control of the directing of the 1992 video for Too Funky, featuring models in Mugler outrage-wear. In a later generation, Lady Gaga and Cardi B chose gala appearance gowns from his archives, and after Beyoncé saw Mugler’s work in the 2008 Superheroes exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, she ordered 58 outfits for herself for her 2009 I Am … World Tour, plus gear for the rest of its cast, and asked Mugler to help stage the shows. He was free to make what pleased him rather than fretting about selling frocks because of a 1992 deal with the French multinational Clarins that had awarded him a 34% stake in his new perfume, Angel. Its overwhelming ingredient was synthetic ethyl maltol, which had previously added praline and jam aromas to confectionery, so Mugler models prancing in vinyl, leather and tyre-rubber dresses and plastic corsets smelt like a patisserie. This first gourmand perfume in its box of twilight blue is among the all-time scent bestsellers, and subsidised his last, epic, fashion pageant at the Cirque d’Hiver in Paris in 1995. Mugler had been creating his own theatre and movie-based fantasy world since his childhood in Strasbourg, where he was one of two sons of a local doctor and his fashion-passionate wife. He hated home and school, although after he started dance classes at nine he maintained strict self-discipline to keep at it until he briefly joined the corps de ballet at the city’s Opéra national du Rhin in 1965. Mugler’s real education came from a flea-pit cinema behind Strasbourg’s railway station, where he saw five films a day, many of them old Hollywood: the designer Travis Banton swathing Marlene Dietrich in leather and fur, Walter Plunkett glorifying Cyd Charisse into a rocket-thighed siren. Along with Mugler’s mother’s wide shoulders, Charisse’s form and poise were a lifelong inspiration, and he was thrilled when later she modelled in his shows. Mugler was too lanky to be cast as a ballet prince and too weird in his flea-market outfits to pass without unkind comment in Strasbourg. He rejected Maurice Béjart’s offer to join the Ballet of the 20th Century, because it was based in Brussels, another conventional city, and went to Paris instead. There his self-presentation was applauded and he earned money by selling designs to ready-to-wear firms. He did the same in Amsterdam, while living on a houseboat; he contributed to Tommy Roberts’s London pop art emporium, Mr Freedom; and he drove a van to Afghanistan and learned Kathakali dance in India. But Mugler never turned hippy, and back in Paris in 1971 he was not in accord with the gentle naivety of current fashion. He had developed, through ballet, ideas about the body in movement and wanted to clothe it with striking simplicity, in grand, rather than little, black dresses. In 1973, he started his own first label, Café de Paris, and in 1978 opened a boutique on the Place des Victoires, showing collections with other créateurs de mode who produced exclusive clothes outside the world of haute couture. Mugler’s were by far the most architectural, after the manner of the postmodern style, with cornice shoulders and girder heels, and the most raunchy, using pornographic tropes before body-consciousness was common, which provoked angry reaction from women who disliked his constrictions, restrictions and ideas about vulnerable female flesh encased in predatory shells (seen again in risque designs for a Las Vegas Cirque du Soleil cabaret in 2003). He was fearless; as photographer for his advertisements, he led luggage-laden expeditions of models to tough locations, and crawled along a ladder stuck out of a Manhattan skyscraper window to snap models on the edge of building chasms. The organising body of Paris couture formally asked him to show in 1992; he delayed a collection to tie in with the launch of Angel, and, inhibited by the rigid seasonal calendar, later dropped out. Mugler withdrew from fashion in 2002, just before Clarins, who had bought the rights to his name in 1997, closed his loss-making ready-to-wear brand. However, his retirement, funded by Angel, Alien and other perfumes, was busy right up to the current Thierry Mugler: Couturissime exhibition, its core project to remake and redesign himself. First, he reclaimed his birth name, Manfred, then practised yoga and meditation, and morphed his lean frame into massive body-built tattooed muscles. After a jeep crash and a motorbike accident, he had reconstructive facial surgery, designing bone grafts to transform him from a “thin, charming dancer” into “a warrior”.

1/26/2022,"It was only a month ago that Liz Truss, perhaps best known until recently for her strong feelings about the “disgrace” that is imported cheese, was appointed foreign secretary. Some had questioned Truss’s suitability for the role given a patchy record in the cabinet, but the liberty-loving minister has seemingly already made a mark on the global stage.  While Downing Street was battling further claims over alleged lockdown-breaching parties, Truss was the recipient of two eye-catching reviews of her performance at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). Over in Brussels, her EU counterpart, Maroš Šefčovič, with whom Truss recently spent time at the foreign secretary’s official Chevening residence, took time out at a press conference to describe her as a “top notch politician” and a proven “deal maker”. “We have spent a lot of time together and I think that we are now on more or less the same wavelength,” he said. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, China’s nationalist tabloid the Global Times was rather less gushing. She was “a chocolate soldier”, according to an opinion piece published on Tuesday. “So who is Liz Truss … ?” the author, who claimed to be a UK-based journalist and university lecturer, began. “There are probably people in China wondering right now whether she is really mad and even whether she wants war between their nation and her own.” Although the Global Times does not necessarily always speak on behalf of China’s foreign policy establishment, its tone on foreign affairs is often read by analysts as broadly reflective of Beijing’s thinking. Of the two opinions, it is perhaps Šefčovič’s that has the potential to be more problematic. The Brexiter elements of the Conservative party have been rather suspicious of those with whom the EU has felt able to do business – and there may be a leadership election on the way. Recent events have prompted some concern in the EU that the rather warmer relations with the UK government that have prevailed since the resignation of David Frost could be derailed with talks over the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland at a sensitive point. But the attack from Beijing is unlikely to cause any loss of sleep in the Truss household. While the MP for South West Norfolk probably became known to many people for the first time in 2014 when she lit up social media with a cringeworthy Tory party conference speech in which she railed against French cheese imports, in recent years she has put her efforts into stressing the commitment she shares with Margaret Thatcher for liberty and freedom. The Global Times opinion piece appeared to be a response to Truss’s series of remarks in Australia last week when she highlighted on several occasions China’s challenges to liberal democracies. Towards the end of one speech at the Sydney-based Lowy Institute thinktank, Truss quoted a line from Thatcher: “Where freedom…exists, I seek to expand it; where it is under attack, I shall defend it; where it does not exist, I shall try to create it.” The Global Times had a different interpretation. “She probably likes to think of herself as another Margaret Thatcher … ” the article responded. “But the truth is she is less of an Iron Lady and more of a chocolate soldier, someone who might look smart and shiny in a uniform, but is utterly clueless when it comes to fighting.” During her visit to Australia, Truss said that China and Russia – who she described as “aggressors” – were “working in concert” to dominate their spheres of influence. She also suggested that Beijing might use a Russian invasion of Ukraine as an opportunity to launch aggression of its own in the region. The former Australian prime minister Paul Keating called her remark “nothing short of demented”.",News/Politics,Liz Truss: why EU praise for foreign secretary may be unwanted,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/25/liz-truss-why-eu-praise-foreign-secretary-unwanted
1/26/2022,"Cyber-activists opposed to the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, say they have penetrated the state-run railway’s computer system and threatened to paralyse trains moving Russian troops and artillery to the country for a potential attack on Ukraine. Their goals include freeing political prisoners, removing Russian soldiers from Belarus, and preventing Belarusians from “dying for this meaningless war”, a person involved in the attack told the Guardian.  A member of the “Cyberpartisans” said the hacktivist group had so far encrypted or destroyed internal databases that the Belarusian railways use to control traffic, customs and stations, an action that could cause delays to commercial and non-commercial trains and “indirectly affect Russia troops movement”. They had so far avoided taking more drastic steps to paralyse trains by downing the signalling and emergency control systems, but said they “might do that in the future if we’re confident innocent people won’t get injured as a result”. The group has demanded that Belarus cease serving as a staging ground for a buildup of Russian troops and military weaponry, some of it just miles from the Ukrainian border. “We don’t want Russian soldiers in Belarus since it compromises the sovereignty of the country and puts it in danger of occupation,” the member of the Cyberpartisans told the Guardian. “It also pulls Belarus into a war with Ukraine. And probably Belarusian soldiers would have to participate in it and die for this meaningless war.” An unverified local report had said that the buildup may include nearly 200 trains with Russian troops and equipment (military exercises in 2021 involved just 29 trains), although the Cyberpartisans said they had not sought or found confirmation of that number in the hacked databases yet. To relinquish control over the Belarusian railways’ computer system, the group has also demanded the release of more than 50 political prisoners from Belarusian jails requiring medical assistance. The domestic human rights group Viasna has counted more than 995 political prisoners in Belarus following Lukashenko’s bloody crackdown on protests after elections marred by fraud in 2020. The latest hack highlights the prominent role that cyber-operations against infrastructure could play in an upcoming conflict in the region, and shows how Lukashenko’s domestic battles may follow him into his tightening alliance with the Kremlin. One key factor in the anti-Lukashenko protests that began in 2020 was opposition to plans for greater economic and political integration of Russia and Belarus under a “Union State”. Among Lukashenko’s staunchest opponents are the Cyberpartisans, a group of about 25 anonymous IT experts and other activists who have pulled off an impressive and embarrassing series of hacks against the government since they first appeared after the protests of 2020. That has included a daring raid on the servers of the Belarus Ministry of Interior Affairs, giving them access to data on thousands of serving police officers in a country where many had sought to hide their identities while brutally cracking down on civil protests. They have also obtained access to passport databases, secret files belonging to Belarusian KGB spies and security officials, police databases of informants, and prison CCTV networks confirming police brutality and torture. They have released hundreds of thousands of hours of wiretapped telephone conversations, including those of top officials. Recently, the group has expanded into targeting state companies and firms that serve as sources of cash for Lukashenko, using ransomware attacks to demand the release of political prisoners rather than money. “Since it became very dangerous for people to openly protest against the regime, we now became the only force capable of operating in Belarus,” said a member of the group, identified by the Cyrillic letter Ж (Zh). “We show real results of our work both by hacking and attacking government institutions and conducting physical impact operations.” To confirm access to a recent database of hacked records of border crossings, Zh sent a Guardian correspondent a full list of his travel records to Belarus going back to 2016. “We have it for sure,’ wrote Zh. “Just a sec.” That data would also allow the group to identify Belarusian and Russian spies crossing the country’s borders, Zh said, as well as “trips made by Lukashenko and his cronies and close circle, and would help reveal illegal activities and put sanctions on them. “We know now more about his assets, his lovers, and secret criminal schemes” because of the hacks, Zh said. “We think he only now realises how much information we were able to gather and how harmful it is for him.” The series of hacks has clearly shaken the government. The Cyberpartisans and two other pro-democracy groups were named as extremists this summer, and Lukashenko addressed the series of leaks by telling his top officials to write down information by hand instead. “If you cannot … protect information on your computers, then go back to using paper,” Lukashenko told his ministers at a meeting in mid-August. “Write by hand and put it in your desk.” Although members of the group remain anonymous (even to one another), their operations are still dangerous, they say, because they sometimes require insiders on the ground to take risks. To access the Interior Ministry network, “our people entered a regime’s facility and installed bridges that allowed us to connect to the MIA network remotely,” Zh said. Threatening to disrupt Russia’s military buildup near Ukraine is likely to force the government to redouble its efforts to track down the group. We are “concerned for our safety and to be honest, our lives,” wrote Zh. “The Belarusian government tries to infiltrate us but has not succeeded as of yet.”",News/World news,‘Cyberpartisans’ hack Belarusian railway to disrupt Russian buildup,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/cyberpartisans-hack-belarusian-railway-to-disrupt-russian-buildup
1/26/2022,"A Boston-area hospital said it will not perform a heart transplant on a patient who refuses to get a Covid-19 vaccination. DJ Ferguson, 31, was previously prioritized for a heart transplant at Brigham and Women’s hospital, but is no longer eligible as he refuses to get vaccinated, said Ferguson’s family, according to a report by CBS Boston.  “It’s kind of against his basic principles – he doesn’t believe in it,” said David Ferguson, his father. “It’s a policy they are enforcing and so, because he won’t get the shot, they took him off the list [for] a heart transplant.” Brigham and Women’s explained its reasoning in a statement: “Like many other transplant programs in the United States – the Covid-19 vaccine is one of several vaccines and lifestyle behaviors required for transplant candidates in the Mass General Brigham system in order to create both the best chance for a successful operation and also the patient’s survival after transplantation.” Other medical experts have declared their support of the hospital’s policy, noting that the immune system is extremely weak after a transplant, making vaccinations all the more important. “Post any transplant, kidney, heart whatever, your immune system is shut off. The flu could kill you, a cold could kill you, Covid could kill you,” said Dr Arthur Caplan, the head of medical ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, told CBS Boston. “The organs are scarce: we are not going to distribute them to someone who has a poor chance of living when others who are vaccinated have a better chance post-surgery of surviving.” Ferguson’s family have said they are unsure of what to do next given his refusal to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. They have considered transferring him to a different facility but acknowledge he might not survive the trip. “We are aggressively pursuing all options, but we are running out of time,” said David Ferguson. The family said that while had received excellent care at Brigham and Women’s, they do not agree with the policy. “I think my boy is fighting pretty damn courageously, and he has integrity and principles he really believes in, and that makes me respect him all the more,” said Ferguson of his son, who is a father of two children with another one on the way. “It’s his body.
