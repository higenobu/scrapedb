1/11/2022,"The Duke of York has settled a £6.6m debt with a French socialite allowing him to sell a Swiss chalet as he faces escalating legal bills over the sexual assault civil lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, according to reports. Isabelle de Rouvre, 74, who sold the property to Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York, in 2014 for a reported £18m, said: “The war is over. He has paid the money.”  Andrew and his ex-wife had agreed with Rouvre that Chalet Helora in the ski resort of Verbier in the Swiss Alps, would be paid for in instalments. But Rouvre claimed the two failed to make the final £5m instalment. Initially Rouvre agreed the final instalment could be deferred until December 2019, with interest accruing, but the Yorks still did not honour the agreement despite repeated demands, it was reported. Rouvre launched legal action in May 2020 in Switzerland to recoup the £5m plus interest owed to her. Andrew is said to have finally paid late last year. Speaking to MailOnline, Rouvre said she had sold the house to the Yorks around two months ago. “That is the end of the story thankfully,” she told the website. “The war is finished. It is the end of the matter. I have nothing to do with it now. That’s all.” She added: “It was about six weeks ago that the matter was closed. It was November. The second payment needed to be paid and that payment is now done. That’s it. You can be sure that’s it. It’s done.” A source close to the duke said: “I can confirm that the legal action has been halted and that the chalet is being sold – but otherwise no comment on private financial matters.” The duke is now selling the property as he faces the lawsuit brought against him by Giuffre, who alleges she was forced to have sex with the royal on three occasions after she was trafficked by the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew has denied the allegations. His ex-wife and the couple’s daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, stayed at the chalet over the New Year holiday. As a family, the Yorks had rented the seven-bedroomed chalet, which has an indoor swimming pool, for winter holidays before deciding to buy it as a nest egg for their daughters. Until the debt was settled, Andrew was unable to sell it. It is understood a buyer has been found and the sale is proceeding, but not yet completed. Andrew is awaiting a New York judge’s decision on his application to have Giuffre’s lawsuit against him dismissed.",News/UK news,"Prince Andrew can sell Swiss chalet after settling £6.6m debt, say reports",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/11/prince-andrew-sell-swiss-chalet
1/11/2022,"For 156 minutes at the start of England’s second innings in Sydney, as he set about compiling the second-highest score of his Test career and propelled his team towards the draw that ensured they will avoid a series whitewash, Zak Crawley found himself experiencing something that not many English cricketers have managed in Australia this winter: having fun. It was not just for his team that the fourth Test represented the end of a miserable run, as in his first match of 2022 the 23-year-old shrugged off the poor form that had dogged him in 2021 to re-establish himself in the side with an impressive innings of 77.  “It was not far off the most fun I’ve ever had on a cricket field,” he said on Tuesday. “I mean, that’s the reason I play the game, for days like that. I massively enjoyed it, absolutely loved it. Cricket, you get so many failures that you have to enjoy the good times. And when you’re playing nicely, it doesn’t get more fun than that.” Having scored an apparently career-defining 267 in his final Test of 2020 against Pakistan in Southampton, at which point he was averaging 48.41 after 12 international innings, Crawley floundered in 2021. Across the year he averaged 10.81 in 16 Test innings and 23.14 across 37 first-class knocks for Kent and country. “It’s all a great learning curve,” he said. “You tend to learn more from your failures than your successes and it wasn’t the year I wanted. We played some great opposition on some really tough pitches – I wasn’t too hard on myself in some regards. I learned a lot about myself and my game and I feel like I can push on from it and become a better player.” It is true that he faced some particularly difficult sporting challenges in 2021, from India in Ahmedabad to Australia with the wind in their sails in Melbourne. “Playing in India against that spin and then at the MCG in that final session [on the second day] – they’re the two hardest spells of cricket I’ve ever had by a long way and I wouldn’t have thought that it would get much harder than those two experiences. You’ve just got to take them on the chin and move on and learn from them.” While Joe Root, Jonny Bairstow, Rory Burns and Ollie Pope have first-class averages in the 40s or, in Pope’s case, 50s, Crawley’s languishes in the low 30s – 31.21 at present, down slightly since he made his England debut in December 2019. This he puts down to “the fact I’ve batted on poor pitches really my whole Championship career”. Unusually, his first-class average is worse – 29.15 – on his home ground of Canterbury. “I don’t think it’s a Kent thing,” he said. “Obviously I’d like the pitch at Canterbury to be a little bit better. I don’t think it’s unfair of me to say. But I think pretty much all the grounds I’ve played on have been pretty poor. I can think of about two or three where I’ve got to them thinking that this is a really good wicket. The pitches have been very favourable to bowlers my whole career so far so until that changes …” It is one of Crawley’s regrets that he has not “gone on to score big hundreds”, though he draws frequently on the memory of the one time he did. “I watch that innings frequently to be honest, when I’m going through bad form, because it’s a nice reminder that I’ve done it before and I can do it again,” he says of his 267. “Sometimes if you’re feeling a bit rough you can lose sight of the fact that you can play. I played really nicely that day, but I feel like I’m a better player now and that’s because of the failures I had last year. I learned a lot about myself, like what not to do almost. I would have liked to score a lot more runs, but for that I’m quite thankful.” Whatever happens in this week’s final Test in Hobart, given the way the tour has panned out everyone involved with the England squad will leave with some failures to learn from. “The majority of it has been top class and just how I expected it to be – quite hostile Australia crowds and a hostile Australian team who are very good in their own conditions,” Crawley said. “Unfortunately we haven’t performed quite at our best but it’s a great experience and hopefully – we’ll see how my career turns out – but if I’m back in four years’ time then this experience will be very beneficial.”",Sport/Sport,Zak Crawley aims to put 2021 failures behind him after ‘fun’ Ashes innings ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/11/zak-crawley-england-ashes-cricket
1/11/2022,"Set in some densely forested, geographically-non-specific corner of Mexico, this very low-budget horror story features Autumn Reeser as suburban SoCal mom Carly Candlewood, who arrives for a holiday with her husband Andrew (Antonio Cupo) and young son Danny (Nicolas Madrazo). Together, they’re hoping to heal as a family after Carly’s recent miscarriage. Unfortunately, no one mentioned in the TripAdvisor reviews that the canals near the small hotel where the Candlewoods are staying have been haunted for years by a spooky ghost lady called La Llorona (Zamia Fandiño). The name relates to the fact that she’s always crying for her lost child, and her own way of dealing with bereavement is to steal other people’s kids, especially at night or at least when the camera has a red filter attached to create a murky, nocturnal look. What’s more, all the locals know about her, and a memorial wall nearby is plastered with pictures of missing children: an unpleasant echo of the legions of people abducted throughout the country in real life. La Llorona usually takes the form of an ectoplasmic, diaphanous figure with a flowing gown, generous embonpoint and a half-smashed face. But of late it seems she’s been gaining corporeality; the upside of which is that bullets seem to temporarily repel her. But her growing strength represents a near and present danger for little Danny, whom she keeps catching and then losing as Carly fights her off.  Although it’s always a treat to see veteran character actor Danny Trejo doing his stuff – playing an ambiguous figure attached to the hotel – both he and most of the rest of the cast deliver their lines with the flat, enthusiasm-free cadences of an ensemble cheesed off with the size of their paycheques and the quality of the catering. The honourable exceptions are Fandiño herself and Mauricio Galaz as her lover, seen in a key flashback, who emote like they’re auditioning for the next hit telenovela.

1/11/2022,"The Wellcome Trust, Britain’s biggest charity, is ramping up spending on science research to £16bn over the next 10 years, with a focus on funding next-generation Covid-19 vaccines, after it reaped the highest investment returns in a quarter of a century. Wellcome said it was making its biggest funding commitment to science and health in its 85-year history. It was created by the will of the pharmaceuticals entrepreneur Sir Henry Wellcome in 1936. The £16bn promise comes after it spent more than £9bn on research grants and other charitable activities over the past decade, including £1.2bn last year alone.  The trust made a 34.5% return in the year to 30 September on its investment portfolio, which is now worth £38.2bn, about £10bn more than a year ago. This is its best performance since it was created in its present form as an independent charitable foundation in 1995, when Wellcome plc was sold off to the drugmaker Glaxo, which later became GlaxoSmithKline. One of Wellcome’s top investment picks was DoorDash, a US-based food delivery business, which doubled in price since its stock market flotation in December. Sir Jeremy Farrar, the director of Wellcome and a former member of the government’s Sage advisory committee, said these investment returns marked “a step-change in Wellcome’s ability to fund and support new discoveries in science and health, and help solve three of the great challenges of the 21st century: climate change, infectious diseases and mental health”. “With plans to spend £16bn on our mission over the next decade, we will be increasing our spending from the previous decade by more than 50%,” he added. Farrar said some of this would go towards funding second- and third-generation Covid-19 vaccines as part of Wellcome’s infectious diseases programme, as the virus becomes endemic. The trust’s annual report showed that pay packets surged at its investment team after the record returns. Nick Moakes, the chief investment officer, was awarded £7.9m last year while Peter Pereira Gray, the chief executive of the investment division, received a £7.8m package. The packages include long-term bonuses that have not been paid yet. The previous year, they were awarded £4.6m and £4.5m, respectively. Wellcome said the pay packages were considerably less than what it would pay an outside firm of investment managers. In comparison, Farrar was paid £515,216 last year, up from £483,788 in 2020. The executive leadership team received £2.5m in pay, lower than the 2020 figure of £3.1m. Wellcome said it would spend more on cross-sector collaborations such as the public-private Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI), co-founded by Wellcome in 2017, which has brought together various parties to develop and fairly distribute Covid-19 vaccines. Wellcome also helped fund the Covid vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. As part of its £150m commitment to fight the pandemic, the charity has supported genomics researchers to keep up with the virus. The Wellcome Sanger Institute was at one point responsible for half of the world’s Covid-19 sequencing. Julia Gillard, the chair of the Wellcome Trust, said: “The exceptional long-term performance of the investment portfolio has provided us with the means to increase spending commitments significantly at a time when the mission has never been more important.” While Wellcome made spectacular returns from some investments, Syncona, a UK-listed life sciences firm founded by the trust in 2012, had a very disappointing year, with the share price falling by nearly a third.",News/Business,Wellcome Trust to spend £16bn on research with focus on Covid vaccines ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/11/wellcome-trust-covid-vaccines
1/11/2022,"A west-to-east “tidal wave” of Omicron infections risks submerging health systems across Europe, the World Health Organization has said, warning that more than half the region’s population will be infected with the variant in the next two months. Hans Kluge, the WHO’s Europe director, said the region had recorded more than 7m new cases in the first week of 2022, double the rate a fortnight previously, with more than 1% of the population catching Covid-19 each week in 26 countries.  Kluge said the variant had been reported in 50 of the Europe region’s 53 states and was becoming dominant in western Europe. “At this rate, more than 50% of the population in the region will be infected with Omicron in the next six to eight weeks”, he said – a scale of transmission he described as unprecedented. Its impact would be deadliest where vaccination rates were lower, such as in central and eastern Europe, Kluge predicted, saying he was “deeply concerned” that as Omicron moved east, “we have yet to see its full impact in countries where levels of vaccination uptake are lower, and where we will see more severe disease in the unvaccinated”. In Denmark, he said, where Omicron cases had “exploded in recent weeks”, the Covid-19 hospitalisation rate for unvaccinated patients during Christmas week had been six times higher than for those who were fully vaccinated. While vaccines provided “good protection” against severe disease and death, rising hospital admissions were “challenging health systems and service delivery in many countries … and threaten to overwhelm them in many more”, he said. Kluge said countries not yet hit by the Omicron surge had “a closing window of opportunity to act now” by protecting their most vulnerable citizens, as well as doing their utmost to ensure healthcare and other key workers could keep services running. Governments in these countries should mandate high-quality masks in all closed and indoor spaces and ensure full vaccine series and booster doses were given as early as possible, especially in the health and essential services sectors, he said. “Where the Omicron surge has begun, the priority should be to avoid and reduce harm among the vulnerable, and minimise disruption to health systems and essential services,” Kluge said. “This means prioritising vulnerable people for primary course and booster doses, advising them to avoid closed, crowded spaces, and offering the possibility to work remotely wherever possible until the infection surge passes.” PCR testing should be prioritised for individuals at risk of severe disease and critical workers, he said and rapid tests should be deployed more widely, again “prioritising contacts at high risk of infection and at high risk of severe outcome”. After moves by several European governments to shorten isolation and quarantine periods to prevent economies grinding to a halt, Kluge said such decisions should be taken “only when essential to preserve critical service continuity”. Shorter isolation and quarantine times should also be conditional on negative tests, he said, adding that in general all such decisions “must be taken with careful weighing of the risks and benefits of doing so”. Keeping schools open had “important benefits for children’s mental, social and educational wellbeing”, he said, urging governments to review protocols on testing, isolation and quarantine of classroom contacts to minimise disruption to learning. However, he said Omicron’s greater transmissibility meant authorities should prepare for a mix of online learning and in-class attendance.",News/World news,"Omicron could infect 50% of Europeans in next two months, says WHO",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/omicron-europe-tidal-wave-who
1/11/2022,"Nothing lasts forever, as numerous proud old English rugby clubs can testify. Orrell, West Hartlepool, Wakefield, Waterloo, Rugby Lions, London Welsh … all of them have been in the top two leagues in the country in the past 25 years before disappearing off the radar when financial reality struck. The downward spiral, once it commences, can be desperately hard to arrest. Which begs a question: how will English domestic club rugby look 10 or 20 years from now? Here’s a fun piece of trivia for you: a time capsule was buried in Twickenham’s South Stand in 2006-07 containing, among other things, predictions of the future made by Rugby Football Union officials of the day. It is tempting to be flippant – will blazers really be back in fashion by 2042? – but futuristic change could yet arrive sooner than many people imagine.  Inside the past week, two of England’s more knowledgeable club officials, independently of each other, have shared the same opinion with me: that rugby union, participation-wise, will have morphed into something akin to American football within a decade. If you are any good you will play professionally, semi-professionally or at a good level at university or college. Otherwise recreational men’s rugby will largely be limited to touch, tag and sevens. For many clubs from the Championship downwards this is an apocalyptic scenario. Some of them have been going for 150 years or longer. That is a hell of a lot of history to watch float down the local river. But check out the damage that Covid-19 continues to do to finances and participation numbers, and the loss of some long-standing pillars of the club community looks increasingly probable. It is increasingly hard, certainly, to argue with the view of an administrator involved in the ongoing review into the future of the Championship, the second-tier competition that has been allowed to wither on the vine, in terms of proactive promotion, for the past two decades. “We will probably see an NFL-type franchise professional game, a strong game in the universities and a first team club league but you probably won’t see a social and recreational game in the way we understand it,” suggests my informant, citing concussion fears and the increasing physical commitment required at all levels. “I won’t say recreational players are an endangered species but they’re certainly at risk.” Time to reach for my battered copy of the classic The Art of Coarse Rugby by Michael Green. Even then the author’s contention, when it was first published back in 1960, was that two types of rugby existed. The first kind was made up of “devoted enthusiasts who train like mad and don’t mind at all if someone tackles them at 30 miles per hour”. The rest play “Coarse Rugby”, instantly distinguished by the fact that “neither side is ever composed of 15 men. Most Extra Bs or Cs wouldn’t know what to do what to do with 15 players. They would have to send three or four off before they could begin”. And so on and so forth. There is still fun to be had in playing abbreviated or different forms of the game but the post-Covid pips are increasingly squeaking for any club looking to operate at a decent semi-pro level. One recent survey suggested a fall from 259,600 active adult players in England in 2016 to only 95,100 at the end of last season. Covid and funding cuts have also left Championship sides touching the void. This month, after much deliberation, the Championship Review group will make recommendations to the RFU management board on what it believes the future should look like and its findings will be fascinating. There is an awful lot at stake for all concerned. The so-called “seamless” game, linking both ends of the English rugby pyramid, has never felt more precarious. The Premiership, currently with no relegation and due to expand to 14 sides next season, is a good competition but money is tighter than ever. No one wants to be demoted to the Championship where such losses will be magnified. But the Championship also has to mean something, both in terms of player development and in its own right. Ultimately it needs to be a league for good players to aspire to and for sponsors to embrace. And which sees ambition rewarded. The challenge for the RFU, as ever, is to square that vexed circle and find a collective vision that works for everyone. For now there is a moratorium on relegation from the Premiership until the 2023-24 season when a play-off with promotion and relegation is envisaged with one-up, one-down promotion and relegation, at least in theory, resuming the following season. As a result Twickenham is rejecting any mention of the phrase “ring-fencing” with negotiations – including more sharing of players between Premiership and Championship clubs and potentially second-tier sides in the Premiership Cup – apparently making headway. But are the priorities of a select few in danger of shaping the best interests of the majority? The health of English rugby cannot hinge primarily on the wallets of a few generous millionaires keen to win the Premiership, particularly with growing dissatisfaction again surfacing beneath the elite level. Some feel the RFU is trying to have its cake and eat it. There is unlikely to be any word before the end of February at the earliest, for example, as to how many sides will be promoted from the National Leagues this April. We do know the Championship will have 12 teams next season (this season’s bottom side will not be relegated) but, depending on whether Ealing Trailfinders or Doncaster Knights finish top and also satisfy the minimum standards criteria (another saga in itself) to go up, there is still no clarity over whether one or two sides will be promoted from National One. Or, even more pertinently, any firm guarantees about funding levels after 2024. Uncertainty, as a result, is rippling across the shires. If the RFU also foresees a gridiron-style future for rugby it should say so without delay and explain why that is good news. Because, for those left behind, the repercussions will be huge and, potentially, ruinous. If grassroots rugby union in England is to be salvageable in 2032, never mind 2042, there needs to be something left to save.  This is an extract from our email, the Breakdown.

1/11/2022,"Mohamed Salah has insisted he is “not asking for crazy stuff” to extend his Liverpool contract. Salah has entered the final 18 months of his contract, an incentivised deal worth about £200,000 a week, and Liverpool will have to pay the most lucrative salary in their history to secure the prolific forward long term.  Talks on an extension have been ongoing for months, with Jürgen Klopp involved and Liverpool agreeing new deals in the meantime with Virgil van Dijk, Alisson, Jordan Henderson, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Andy Robertson and Fabinho. Salah has stated repeatedly that he wants to stay at the club that made him a global star but, in an interview with the latest edition of British GQ, maintains he is not making outlandish demands of Liverpool’s owner, Fenway Sports Group. The 29-year-old said: “I want to stay, but it’s not in my hands. It’s in their hands. They know what I want. I’m not asking for crazy stuff.” Salah, who is at the Africa Cup of Nations with Egypt, believes Liverpool’s offer should reflect what he has given to the club since his arrival from Roma in 2017. “The thing is when you ask for something and they show you they can give you something,” he said, they should, “because they appreciate what you did for the club. I’ve been here for my fifth year now. I know the club very well. I love the fans. The fans love me. But with the administration, they have [been] told the situation. It’s in their hands.” Klopp has described Salah as the best player in the world several times this season and the forward, who came seventh in the Ballon d’Or, admits it is his ambition to be recognised as such. “If you asked me if this was a drive for me to be here? Yeah, of course. I can’t really lie and say honestly I didn’t think about it. No, I think about it. I want to be the best player in the world. But I will have a good life even if I don’t win [the Ballon d’Or]. My life is OK, everything is fine.” Salah also reveals in the interview how he struggled mentally during a disappointing spell with Chelsea earlier in his career. He says: “It was so tough for me, mentally. I couldn’t handle the pressure I had from the media, coming from outside. I was not playing that much. I felt, ‘No, I need to go.’”  The GQ Global Sports Issue is available on newsstands and via digital download on 25 January 2022.",Sport/Football,‘I’m not asking for crazy stuff’: Salah opens up on Liverpool contract talks,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/11/mohamed-salah-liverpool-contract-talks-not-asking-crazy-stuff
1/11/2022,"As the last news programme came to a close and anchors bade farewell to their online audience on 3 January, Chris Yeung, the founder and chief writer of Citizen News, gathered together his staff and tried to strike an optimistic tone. “Remember our very best memories,” he said, dressed in a blue shirt with sleeves rolled up and a crimson jumper draped on his shoulders. “No one knows what will happen next. Don’t worry. Just remember the happy things.”  It was the day 90 largely pro-establishment legislators were sworn in. The previous evening, the independent Chinese-language news outlet of five years said it was closing. It justified the decision citing a deteriorating media environment and concerns for the safety of its staff. It was a painful decision for Yeung and his editor-in-chief, Daisy Li, to make. “If I am no longer confident enough to guide and lead my reporters, I must be responsible,” Li said last week. “Can we work on some ‘safe news’? I don’t even know what is ‘safe news’.” She added: “What has changed is not us but the exterior, objective environment.” On 4 January, another outlet, Mad Dog Daily, followed suit and halted operations together with Citizen News. The latest developments came as no surprise to those who follow recent events in Hong Kong’s once-freewheeling media industry. An exodus of journalists and editors from the territory’s much-acclaimed news outlets such as Cable TV and its public broadcaster, RTHK, in the last couple of years have alarmed free speech campaigners in the city and beyond. Barely a week ago, another Chinese-language outlet, Stand News, was forced to close after 200 police officers raided its office and detained seven current and former employees. Two former senior editors were charged with conspiring to publish seditious materials and denied bail. The Stand News arrests came a day after Jimmy Lai, the former owner of the popular tabloid Apple Daily, and six of its former journalists were given new charges of “conspiracy to ‘print, publish, sell, offer for sale, distribute, display and/or reproduce seditious publications”. Last June, the newspaper was forced to close. State media in Beijing called the newspaper a “rotten apple that plagued Hong Kong for 20 years”. Amnesty International said it was “the blackest day for media freedom in Hong Kong’s recent history”. Across Asia, the erosion of press freedom has repeatedly made headlines in recent years. In Myanmar, dozens of journalists have been jailed since last year’s military coup. In Thailand, an emergency decree to ban news that “incites fear” was announced after anti-government protests in 2020. And in the Philippines, the country’s most profitable broadcaster, ABS-CBN, was forced to shut down that same year. These incidents are a poignant reminder that even the most successful news outlets would not survive the authoritarian resurgence in the region. In Hong Kong – once a bastion of free speech within China’s territory – the intensified move against independent news outlets began shortly after Beijing imposed a controversial national security law in the summer of 2020. The legislation drew fierce criticisms from western capitals, from Washington to London. Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, however, said the closure of news organisations “cannot be directly connected” to press freedom in Hong Kong. She also rejected claims of a “chilling effect” in the city’s media landscape. The assault on press freedom have continued after the Apple Daily saga. A few days after the tabloid’s had folded last year, the city’s police chief, Raymond Siu, suggested that a “fake news” legislation would be necessary to tackle “hostility against the police”. His boss, Lam, announced a few weeks prior that her administration was working on “fake news” legislation to tackle “misinformation, hatred and lies”. “The authorities are just adding more weapons into their pocket in order to stifle dissent,” Yeung told the Guardian after Siu’s speech in June. “It looks very likely that this proposal of ‘fake news’ law will be put on the agenda in the next legislative session.” In recent years, Hong Kong Journalists Association, which Yeung used to lead, raised the authorities’ ire. Last autumn, the city’s new security chief, Chris Tang, accused the organisation of “breaching professional ethics” by backing the idea that “everyone is a journalist”. In December, Tang gave his full backing to the introduction of a fake news legislation. The psychological impact on Hong Kong’s journalists – once regarded as muckraking by many – is evident. A November survey released by Hong Kong’s Foreign Correspondents Club found that 84% of the surveyed deemed the situation had deteriorated since the introduction of the national security law. Some of the respondents admitted a degree of self-censorship. Beijing accused the trade association of “sowing discord”. “We are very nervous here for the future of media freedom in Hong Kong,” said Jemimah Steinfeld, a China expert at the London-based Index on Censorship. “It’s hard to believe today that until only recently Hong Kong was the place that journalists at foreign media went to if they wanted to report more freely on China. It’s devastating.” For young and ambitious Hong Kong journalists, the devastation has been personal. When the police raided Apple Daily’s headquarters in 2020, one of its staff reporter was angry. “I at first was too stunned to even react,” Oscar said in a Guardian documentary that year. “Then that turned into anger as I watched the events unfold.” Last June, when the nails had been hammered into the coffin of Apple Daily, he met a colleague a the subway platform to share their plans for the future. They greeted each other with a big hug and broke out in tears. “We have never done anything wrong. We have always been doing our part and working hard to make good news. Why did we end up this way?” he said. Now at the age of 25, Oscar has put down his pen and works as a photographer in Hong Kong. He said he “grieved” upon leaving Apple Daily in June. “I [had studied journalism] in college for four years, worked for Apple Daily as part-timer then full-time [for] over four years. It was my dream and passion to be a great reporter, and I did work hard for it. But It turned out to be like this,” he said. The quick turn of events in his home city in recent years has saddened him. Months after mass street protests that began in 2019, the national security law came into force. The authorities claim such legislation is “necessary in order to secure the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong”, but critics say it is used to stifle dissent and is “draconian”. In reality, there have been waves of arrests of individuals – from journalists to politicians – who disagree with Beijing and the Hong Kong governments. According to Reporters Without Borders, close to two dozen journalists and press freedom campaigners have been arrested since the implementation of the National Security Law in June 2020. Among them, at least a dozen have been charged or are awaiting the trial. Some opposition politicians – including Nathan Law, once the youngest lawmaker in the history of the legislative council of Hong Kong – are now living in exile. For Oscar, his transition from a reporter to a photographer was a reluctant one. “This is not the decision I wanted to make, it is the times that forced me to stop being a reporter,” he said. “I still want to be a reporter from the bottom of my heart. I’m not afraid to sit in prison. But how about the people who work with me? Will they sit in, too, because of my work? How about my family and my girlfriend? They’d absolutely be heartbroken.” But it is not only local Chinese-language news outlets that are feeling the chill.
