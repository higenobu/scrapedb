3/25/2022,"Australia waited nine years to accept the New Zealand refugee deal out of fear asylum seekers would snub the option of the US, independent senator Jacqui Lambie and the Morrison government have claimed. On Thursday Australia accepted an offer first made in February 2013 to take up to 450 refugees and asylum seekers, which Lambie then revealed had been a key commitment to win her casting vote to repeal legislation improving access to medical evacuation from offshore detention. Refugee advocates welcomed the move but were critical of the delay, including Amnesty International Australia which argued that “people have had years of their lives taken from them pointlessly”. When the medevac legislation was repealed in December 2019, the then-government Senate leader, Mathias Cormann, denied the existence of a secret deal. On Friday Lambie explained she had stayed silent on the deal because “I was told if I disclosed the terms of the deal, there would be no more deal”. “I don’t believe that was said out of malice,” she said in a statement. “The United States resettlement agreement was still going when I negotiated with the Morrison government. “And because not everybody who was eligible for resettlement with the United States program would definitely qualify for the New Zealand program, I couldn’t speak out, in case asylum seekers who had a spot in the US deal would turn it down in the hope of taking the New Zealand option.“It took longer than I wanted it to.” Lambie said she stuck by her decision to repeal the medevac legislation, arguing this gave her “leverage to get people out of offshore detention … to let them move on with their lives, after years of limbo”. In 2016 the then Turnbull government struck a deal with the US to take up to 1,200 refugees and asylum seekers from Australia’s offshore detention. On Friday the finance minister and Liberal Senate leader, Simon Birmingham, also defended the nine-year delay in accepting New Zealand’s offer. “We put a priority on making sure we delivered on the deal with the US for resettlement,” he told Sky News. Birmingham said the New Zealand deal was necessary to deal with a “small legacy caseload of individuals” and would not result in a pull factor for refugee boats, which he said had been “prevented” by the Coalition’s other policies such as turnbacks. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, told reporters in Shellharbour the Coalition had “rejected” arrangements struck by former prime minister Julia Gillard and former New Zealand prime minister John Key. Albanese said the Morrison government had now accepted the deal “in the dying days of their third term in office” after years of rhetoric that to do so would restart boats. “There was no reason why they could [not have accepted] the repeated offers of the New Zealand government … to settle people who were on Nauru and Manus Island,” he said, delay which resulted in both a “human cost but also an incredibly significant economic cost to Australia”. The former home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has repeatedly described the New Zealand deal as a potential “pull factor” that could restart dangerous boat journeys. Morrison ruled out accepting the deal within days of becoming prime minister in 2018, warning it was not consistent with Australia’s border protection regime. “The thing you know about me on border protection is I’m consistent,” Morrison said in September 2019. “I’ve been consistent on this issue for my entire time in public life.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The shadow minister assisting for immigration, Andrew Giles, told Guardian Australia the government’s claim of prioritising the US deal “doesn’t hold water”. About 200 people are still on the pathway to resettle in the US, he said, indicating the pathways were “distinct”. “This is a desperate deflection from the government to explain a failure to strike a deal that could and should have been accepted years ago,” Giles said. “The only thing the prime minister is consistent on is his inconsistency – that he is prepared to do anything to solve his political problems.”",News/Australia news,"Nine-year wait for NZ refugee deal due to fears of snubbing US option, Jacqui Lambie and government say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/25/nine-year-wait-for-nz-refugee-deal-due-to-fears-of-snubbing-us-option-jacqui-lambie-and-government-say
3/25/2022,"US volunteers have been seen in video footage from the frontlines in Ukraine, suggesting that the international legion fighting alongside the Ukrainian army is playing an increasingly active role. Two video clips featuring US fighters appeared on Twitter on Thursday: one showing an American in combat gear posing in front of the burnt remains of what he said was a Russian tank. Off camera, a Ukrainian shouts “Welcome to America!” and the American repeats the phrase. In the other, narrated by a different soldier with an American accent, shows a detachment of soldiers taking cover by a wall alongside a road, in a village the narrator claims they have recaptured from the Russians. The first video was posted by James Vasquez, a US army veteran and building contractor from Connecticut, who, according to his Twitter feed, arrived in Poland on 15 March and crossed into Ukraine the next day, bringing with him several surveillance drones. He was sent to the frontlines from Lviv on 18 March. “I kind of feel like I’m on an awesome very dangerous vacation,” he said. And in another tweet: “When I need to amp myself up for battle, I just think about the most punchable face on the planet … Tucker Carlson.” He gives an account of patrolling Ukraine going through numerous checkpoints and showing his passport. “They are … shocked to see an American passport when I hit checkpoints,” he said. “They let me right through because they think it’s awesome an American soldier is here to fight alongside them.” In his account of Thursday’s battle for a village he does not name, Vasquez said he was tasked to “find a pack of Russians spotted hiding by civilians” and he used a drone to try to spot them. A few hours later, he tweeted: “Just went through six straight hours of combat. I have crazy video I’ll post later. 2 men were shot but will be OK. One fatality.” Initial accounts of the international legion suggested that the foreign volunteers were a mixed bag, many with no experience. The military news website Task&Purpose reported there was “a swarm of Fantasists for every one candidate with experience in combat”. “Selection apparently follows no discernible process other than separating those that don’t have military experience from those that do. The former are put through a four-week training course – the latter are given a weapon and sent to the front in ad-hoc units with a Ukrainian officer,” the report from Ukraine said.",News/World news,US volunteers reach the frontline of the war in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/us-volunteers-reach-the-frontline-of-the-war-in-ukraine
3/25/2022,"In the weeks following the 2020 election, the conservative activist Ginni Thomas – who is married to the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas – repeatedly implored Donald Trump’s chief of staff to help overturn the results, according to text messages obtained by the Washington Post and CBS News. In one of 29 messages seen by the news outlets, Thomas wrote to Mark Meadows on 10 November: “Help This Great President stand firm, Mark!!! … You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America’s constitutional governance at the precipice. The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.” The messages shed light on Thomas’s direct line to the White House and how she used it to push the “big lie” that Trump had won the election – with Meadows’ apparent support, the Post reported. The exchanges are among 2,320 texts Meadows handed to the House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. “This is a fight of good versus evil,” Meadows wrote in a 24 November message. “Evil always looks like the victor until the King of Kings triumphs. Do not grow weary in well doing. The fight continues. I have staked my career on it. Well at least my time in DC on it.” Meadows’ lawyer, George Terwilliger III, acknowledged the messages’ existence to the Post but said they did not raise “legal issues”. Thomas did not respond to the newspaper’s requests for comment. She has previously said that she does not discuss her activist work with her husband, and the messages do not mention him or the supreme court, according to the Post. Terwilliger and Thomas did not immediately reply to requests for comment from the Guardian. Messages left for the supreme court’s public information office were not immediately returned. When the supreme court rejected Trump challenges over the election in February 2021, Clarence Thomas dissented, calling the decision “baffling”, the Post notes. The text messages – 21 of which are from Thomas and eight from Meadows – contain references to conspiracy theories. Thomas, for instance, highlighted a claim popular among QAnon followers that the president had watermarked certain ballots as a means of identifying fraud. She also suggested the Bidens were behind supposed fraud. “Biden crime family & ballot fraud co-conspirators … are being arrested & detained for ballot fraud right now & over coming days, & will be living in barges off GITMO to face military tribunals for sedition,” she wrote. Thomas seemed to condemn some Republicans in Congress for being insufficiently loyal to Trump. “House and Senate guys are pathetic too… only 4 GOP House members seen out in street rallies with grassroots,” she wrote in a 10 November message, adding later that night: “Where the heck are all those who benefited by Presidents coattails?!!!” Other messages refer to conservative commentators and lawyers who supported Trump’s cause, including Sidney Powell, whom Thomas apparently wanted to be “the lead and the face” of Trump’s legal team. Powell was behind a slate of lawsuits seeking to overturn the election and faces investigation by the Texas State Bar Association over alleged false claims in court. Thomas expressed repeated support for Powell even as she became a divisive figure in pro-Trump circles, the Post notes. “Sidney Powell & improved coordination now will help the cavalry come and Fraud exposed and America saved,” she wrote on 13 November. “Listen to Rush. Mark Steyn, Bongino, Cleta,” Thomas urged Meadows in another message, apparently referring to the commentators Rush Limbaugh, Mark Steyn and Dan Bongino, along with Cleta Mitchell, a lawyer who backed Trump’s claims in Georgia. “I will stand firm. We will fight until there is no fight left,” Meadows replied. “Our country is too precious to give up on. Thanks for all you do.” Thomas has acknowledged attending Trump’s rally prior to the Capitol attack on 6 January 2021, though she says she left before the then president spoke. She condemned the ensuing violence.",News/US news,Ginni Thomas urged Trump’s chief of staff to overturn election results,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/24/ginni-thomas-donald-trump-mark-meadows-texts-election
