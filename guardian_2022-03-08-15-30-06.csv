3/8/2022,"You’ll find it in the depths of Prime Video, provocatively labelled “Private Property – a psycho-sexual thrill ride”. In the accompanying artwork, a stilettoed blonde bombshell displays her rear to camera, her black and white image garishly colorised in purple and yellow. Among the listed cast, character actor Warren Oates is the biggest name, while if you’ve heard of the film’s director, Leslie Stevens, at all, it’s possibly as one of the minds behind the late-70s TV’s Star Wars knock-off Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. Such a package could easily be mistaken for cheap streaming dregs. And Private Property most certainly is cheap, shot as it was largely at its director’s house for less than $60,000, a tiny sum even in 1960 when the film was released to minor outrage from those who saw it. Dregs, however, this shady home invasion thriller ain’t.Beginning seemingly at the end of a twisted Kerouacian travelogue, Private Property opens with weary young travellers Duke (Corey Allen) and Boots (Oates) stopping by a coastal SoCal gas station and attempting to rob it. When model housewife Ann Carlyle (Kate Manx) rolls through in a shiny new Corvette, Duke sees a prize victim to whom the simple-minded Boots can lose his virginity, and promptly hitches the pair a ride to her Hollywood Hills home in pursuit. There, Duke inveigles his way into Ann’s apparently picture-perfect life while her husband is away, her welcoming him in first out of pity, then desire, and him finding he may not even need to coerce his lonely quarry into sex. Uncomfortable for its sexual politics and taste in amoral protagonists even now, it’s hardly conceivable that Private Property could have existed in 1960 – indeed, the film could only have been made on the fringes of Old Hollywood. Funded independently, the production took place over 10 days, with Stevens’ home playing the Carlyle residence and his then-wife Manx taking the role of Mrs Carlyle. Shot quickly and creatively by the Treasure of the Sierra Madre director of photography, Ted McCord, with future three-time Oscar-winning cinematographer Conrad Hall as camera operator, Private Property has the shadowy, angular photography of a noir, albeit one more suggestively, violently sexual than any made in the genre’s golden age. In one moment, we watch a drunken Ann slowly being danced towards the bedroom by Duke through the distorted glass of a tumbler, a dreamlike shot that carries nightmarish implications.In an early appearance, future Peckinpah favourite Oates makes short work of a characteristically scuzzy bad guy role, though better still is Corey Allen as the noxiously charismatic Duke. Perhaps best known as cocksure Buzz Gunderson in Rebel Without a Cause, here Allen plays a calculating know-it-all, a down-on-his-luck regular Joe, a boyishly charming seducer and an entitled, bloody-minded psychopath. The latter is Duke’s true face, bared when he’s incapacitating Ann with alcohol or mockingly describing her as his plaything following a pleasant afternoon at her side: “She’s a cow … If I wanted her for myself, I could have her in the garage or on the patio, or I could have pushed her in the pool.”Though Stevens would go on to work in popular television, creating shows of a sci-fi bent like The Outer Limits, at the time of his directorial debut his interests were more grounded. Inspired by the French new wave, Stevens and producer Stanley Colbert endeavoured to be “authentic”. And so Private Property is a snapshot of America in this moment, a sinister one, looking ahead to what the country will become. Duke and Boots speak the easygoing lingo of the Beats, but their dark, destructive view of America, in particular its affluent classes, suggests the Manson Family. Their target, meanwhile, is a young woman secretly dissatisfied with the supposedly ideal trappings of a steady marriage in suburbia, and freer with her sexuality than Hollywood studio films of the period would care to admit a woman could be. Class tensions and forbidden desires simmer under the surface. At the end of the 1960s, the postwar American dream would have become curdled; in Private Property, we see it already starting to turn.Dismissed in its time – the film was condemned by the National Legion of Decency, declared indecent (if artfully made) by critics, called an “awful, sordid thing” by Jackie Kennedy – Private Property was lost for a period following its 1960 release, before it was rediscovered, restored and re-evaluated as an impressive early example of indie film-making almost six decades later. Despite being given a modern polish for its re-release in 2016, though, the film hasn’t shaken all of the grainy, tinny imperfections imposed by its shoestring production, the rough edges baked into the negative of an inescapably grubby little post-noir.

3/8/2022,"Libby Purves, the former BBC Radio 4 Today presenter, has criticised the corporation for editing archived programmes to remove content deemed offensive, arguing that the cuts are “misguided quixotism”. The public broadcaster has been editing radio shows including Dad’s Army, Steptoe and Son and I’m Sorry, I’ll Read That Again to remove racially insensitive and politically incorrect jokes, the Times revealed earlier this year. Examples included a repeat of a 1971 episode of Steptoe and Son, which was edited to cut the word “poofy” from a line in which Albert Steptoe said: “You’re carrying on like some poofy Victorian poet.” A similar snip was made to a 1974 Dad’s Army episode in which Corporal Jones referred to Chinese people as “yellow friends”. Writing in Radio Times magazine, Purves, who also hosted Midweek on BBC Radio 4, said she had “joined the outcry” at the BBC’s editing, and that while she was sure it was well intentioned there was “no obvious end to such misguided quixotism”. She said outdated sitcom jokes should be kept intact to demonstrate how society has changed. She wrote: “Why dishonestly take a smoothing iron to old jokes, gentrify the crumbly old edifices that sheltered generations from the dull hardness of life? Why would a world that anxiously preserves the jejune wall-scrawls of Banksy be so cavalier with its grandparents’ record? It can’t affect us now. “It’s actually refreshing to be made to cringe: it shows how far we have come, and makes anyone thoughtful wonder which current expressions will shock our grandchildren. I think the insulting catch-all ‘BAME’ will, for instance; as will our mad readiness to throw ‘racist’ as an insult where it isn’t deserved.” Purves has previously railed against wokeism, often called “cancel culture”, one of the many fronts to the so-called culture wars. Writing in the Times last year, Purves said the spirit of Mary Whitehouse, the Conservative activist who campaigned against the media and arts in the 60s and 70s for encouraging a more “permissive” society, was back in the form of “woke” censorship. “Today’s Whitehousery has the same blind, angry piety but with a fresh twist of punitive sadism,” she wrote. “Its hair-trigger instinct will ‘call out’ racism, sexism, ableism, privilege, ‘transphobia’ or implied insensitivity. It demands not just censorship but vengeance: one wrong word and a manager must resign, an author be boycotted, a broadcaster fined or some powerless Twitter nonentity vilified.” The BBC has been approached for comment.",News/Media,Libby Purves criticises BBC’s ‘misguided’ move to clean up old shows,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/08/libby-purves-criticises-bbc-clean-up-old-shows
3/8/2022,"The National Portrait Gallery has acquired five self-portraits by female artists as part of a three-year project to enhance the representation of women in its collection. The gallery, which is currently closed for a major refurbishment, said the works highlighted stories of women who have helped shape British culture. The portraits, created between the early 1970s and 2019, address issues of identity and gender stereotypes, said Flavia Frigeri, a curator at the NPG. “They are not just portraiture of likeness, someone simply depicting themselves. The importance of these five acquisitions is they show the multifaceted identity of an artist, but also of women more generally,” she said. They include the first painted self-portrait by a black female artist in the gallery’s collection. Everlyn Nicodemus’s Självporträtt, Åkersberga layers multiple faces in recognition of her roles as artist, writer, mother and wife. Speaking about the painting, Nicodemus, who emigrated from Tanzania to Sweden in the 1970s and eventually settled in the UK, said: “I exhibited myself as a subject, showing every part of myself, my problems, my hopes, my conflicts – my whole life… It was a form of psychological survival.” Rose Finn-Kelcey was a major figure in the contemporary British art scene for more than four decades. Since her death in 2014, her work has been the subject of greater attention for its engagement with ideas around feminism, spirituality and commodity culture, the NPG said. Her self-portrait, Preparatory Study for “Divided Self”, shows two images of herself engaging in conversation while sitting on a bench at Speaker’s Corner in London’s Hyde Park. By speaking to herself in a place where people have made speeches since the mid-19th century, her self-portrait highlights how women’s voices have traditionally been unheard. Chila Kumari Burman is also depicted twice in her 1988 self-portrait, Aphrodisiacs Being Socially Constructed, taking the distinct roles of a young woman at rest and a warrior. Celia Paul’s painting, Portrait, Eyes Lowered, is intimate and emotionally intense. It was created as part of a series of self-portraits in conjunction with her 2019 memoir, in which she documents her relationship with Lucian Freud, who painted her many times. She said recently: “To see one’s self truthfully is one of the most challenging things for an artist… self-hatred is as invalid as self-love. Both things are false.” Susan Hillier’s Ace (Retrieved) is part of the artist’s series of portraits and self-portraits based on photo-booth images. Hillier, who died in 2019, saw photo-booths as an unfiltered medium, accessible to everyone, including “those who don’t own or can’t borrow cameras”. Frigeri said: “Each of these self-portraits challenges traditional notions of female self-representation and identity.” When the National Portrait Gallery reopens next year, it “will have many more women being celebrated on the walls – not only artists, but women from all walks of life, lawmakers, designers, gardeners, you name it,” she added. “This has plagued a lot of institutions for a very long time. Female sitters and work by women were not considered a priority for many decades.” The NPG’s acquisition of the five self-portraits is part of a three-year project in partnership with the Chanel Culture Fund.",Arts/Art and design,National Portrait Gallery boosts female representation with five new self-portraits,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/08/national-portrait-gallery-boosts-female-representation-with-five-new-self-portraits
3/8/2022,"Our style evolves as we move through life; trends come and go. When we get older, the phrase “age-appropriate” is suddenly everywhere. But not everyone is content to blend into the bland smart-casual background. Some choose to tear up their old wardrobes for something entirely different. What is it that prompts people to revolutionise their styles later in life, to swap streetwear for flouncy skirts or trousers for kilts? And how does it feel to disregard the fashion rulebook? Arlinda McIntosh, 64, New Jersey Throughout my 20s and early 30s in the 80s, I used to wear mainly oversized clothing to hide myself. I would put on leggings and a big T-shirt – things I thought I was supposed to wear, so that onlookers wouldn’t notice anything different about me. I was a married mother working as a receptionist for a cable TV company. But when my husband and I separated in my early 30s, I started altering and making clothes for friends to supplement my income. One day, I was walking down the street in New York and I caught myself in a reflection. I noticed what I was wearing and realised that, rather than dressing to avoid being noticed or judged, I needed to dress so that I could enjoy what I saw. If I’m going to style someone else, I have to be proud of what I’m wearing. I thought: who doesn’t love a wedding and the bride walking down the aisle in her big dress? I wanted to wear something that encapsulated that feeling – and nothing would stop me from wearing it every day, since life itself is a celebration. The clothes I wanted to wear didn’t exist, so I started making these big celebratory skirts, some with trains, so I could bring joy to my appearance. I went from basic to flamboyant almost overnight and wore this huge skirt that looks like a wedding skirt to the mall. I loved how I felt as I caught my reflection. Making and wearing these clothes gave me greater confidence. Eventually, I left my job to become a full-time designer. What’s the point of growing older if you’re not going to be bold about your decision-making? There’s no such thing as young people’s clothing or old people’s clothing – it is all fabric. Being a woman of colour aged over 60, you might feel like you have to dress down – to become almost invisible. Not me; I’m very visible. But I do it so I can be visible to me. You have to come into your own boldness and understand that you can do what you want. Phil Grosset, 51, York I used to dress very much in the “off-duty dad” style with ill-fitting jeans, grey T-shirts, plaid shirts and Dr Martens. I was used to blending in – it’s the same sort of look I’d had since I was 18. In 2020, an internal shift took place. I decided to identify as non‑binary. After that, there was no connection between how I felt on the inside and how I presented on the outside. I began by making small changes publicly – buying tighter-fitting jeans marketed for women and small accessories like bags – then it transformed to wearing sweater dresses, denim jackets, skirts, tights and colourful blouses. Over a few months, my dress changed completely. My wife and friends were so supportive. I don’t see gender in clothing any more. I choose things that I think look nice and make me feel good without worrying about what gender they’re marketed at. Clothes that are marketed to women have so much more choice in their patterns, colours and fabrics – it’s made me addicted to colour. I tend to throw on all the clothes I want to wear; eventually, something will match if you try enough combinations. Gender confusion can be upsetting for a lot of trans and non-binary people, but, if you get to a happier place, there’s also some fun in it and something to be celebrated. I expected a bit of hostility when I started dressing like this, but, for the most part, people either don’t say anything or they are friendly and chatty. It’s been affirming to realise a lot of people are very tolerant and thoughtful. Clothing changes the way others view you, but, more importantly, it changes how you feel about yourself. Now that I feel peaceful and comfortable with myself, I absolutely won’t go back. Najate Leklye, 69, Rotterdam Growing up in the 60s and 70s in Morocco, I dressed in a hippy style. I was attracted to bright colours and wore bootcut trousers and platform heels, or fitted flowery dresses with uncovered hair. My dress sense was very free. Around 1980, when I was 27, I moved to Holland to be with my husband. Three years later, I had my daughter and my style remained largely the same. I was teaching Arabic at an elementary school full of migrant children. Most of the women who came to Holland from Morocco at the same time as me came from the villages and they were a lot more traditional, so I stood out because I wasn’t wearing a hijab. A decade later, at 37, my husband and I divorced and I found a connection with religion. Studying the Qur’an became comforting, like finding an anchor. That was when I decided I would wear a hijab. It changed my dress sense entirely. My clothing had to become more modest – longer and not as tight-fitting. I felt empowered by my choice and my newfound love for my religion. After a few years of dressing for school in my hijab, pantsuits and heels, I began experimenting more with my original love for colour and fabrics. I found a way to have fun with it. I didn’t want to feel awkward about it, or like I was hiding. By the time I was 44 or 45, I had found a new way to express myself through fashion. My style since has been colourful and comfortable. I wear bright hues and match my hijab with my clothes. Once I retired, I wore more streetwear, too – jeans and sweatpants and sneakers bought by my daughter. It’s like I’ve got back my old sense of style from my 20s. I can be extravagant and outgoing, while still expressing my religion – something that feels rare in fashion, especially for women of colour. My confidence has always come from within, so my style has evolved as I have evolved as a human being. I never lost my eye for beautiful things and I never worried about what other people thought of me. I wear my clothes; they don’t wear me. My mantra is: have fun with what you’re wearing, since it’s OK to just be proud of who you are. Robert Batty, 70, Oban Five years ago, my knee was hit by a car door, causing permanent nerve damage. It made my knee so sensitive to touch that I can no longer wear trousers. Before the accident, I would have described myself as someone with an ordinary dress sense – jeans, chinos or smart trousers, depending on the occasion, along with shirts and polo shirts. I have never liked standing out in a crowd. After the accident, I thought about wearing shorts all the time, but when I went out in them in the winter I got rude or flippant comments from people telling me they didn’t realise it was so hot. It made me uncomfortable and anxious. A friend suggested I wear a kilt. I had one for weddings, but I had never worn it on an ordinary day. I took it with me on a trip I was making with my wife to Edinburgh. I imagined that everybody was staring at me, because people tend not to wear the kilt casually. Yet I noticed that it was a conversation starter, too: strangers would come up to me and mention that I was looking very smart, or that it was good to see someone in a kilt. It was so comfortable and avoided the awkward problem of dress codes when it comes to dining at nice restaurants or going to smart places abroad. I decided on that trip to buy another kilt. I now have 10, in a mix of tartans. Even though I felt anxious when I started wearing the kilt, now I wear one almost all the time, since it usually creates so many pleasant interactions with strangers. I’m not always smart on top, either. Not too long ago, I got rid of all my trousers, because there was no point keeping them. In a strange way, being forced to wear the kilt has made me more confident in myself. Faye McNiven, 60, Totnes My mother had an amazing, fearless sense of style – she wore a kilt with a red baseball jacket and blue trainers when she was in her 70s. She encouraged me to express myself through clothing, but I was a bit of a tomboy and always found myself wearing jeans and T-shirts in muted blues and blacks. As I got older, I felt as if I was losing myself more and more, receding into the background and blending in. Like most of us, I found the lockdowns difficult and experienced a lot of anxiety. I was working from home and wearing loungewear until, after six months, I grew fed up and started to re-evaluate how I was dressing and how I wanted to live my life. I realised that I needed to dress for myself, to embrace colour and be visible to me, just like my mother had shown me before she passed away in 1998. My niece mentioned that I should look into a Yorkshire-based company called Lucy & Yak, which makes bright dungarees and boiler suits, and I immediately fell in love with it. I started building a collection of its clothes – yellow and pink boiler suits, white boots, rainbow T-shirts – and began wearing them every day, since it’s silly to save your best clothes for when you go out. The effect was almost instantaneous – it really cheered me up. I was in a much more positive frame of mind and felt as if I was being myself. People started talking to me much more, asking where I got my clothes and saying how they were brightening their days. It made coming out of lockdown far less daunting. The whole experience has brought me much closer to a sense of community with the people who live near me. It’s been liberating not to feel that I need to dress in body-conscious clothes, or in what other people would expect me to wear as a woman. I stopped dyeing my hair as well and have gone grey – it’s all about feeling more comfortable in my own skin. It’s important as a woman who is getting older to get out there and be happy in yourself. You don’t have to be invisible. I’m no longer worried about expressing myself through clothing and colour. I am keeping it bright and won’t fade into the background as I hit my 60s.",Lifestyle/Fashion,"‘I went from basic to flamboyant overnight!’ The people who transformed their style – in their 50s, 60s and 70s",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/08/i-went-from-basic-to-flamboyant-overnight-the-people-who-transformed-their-style-in-their-50s-60s-and-70s
3/8/2022,"The number of cancer research projects in the UK fell by almost a third in the year that Covid-19 hit, data has revealed, with a leading charity saying the decline is linked to the impact of the pandemic on charity shops and fundraising efforts. Figures from the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) have revealed that spending on cancer research had been increasing in the five years before the pandemic. But the trend subsequently reversed, with spending 9% lower in 2020/21 – at £634m – compared with the year before. The NCRI – a UK-wide partnership of cancer research funders – said the number of projects funded dropped by 32% between 2019 and 2020, while the amount awarded to the projects for their whole duration plunged by 57%, from £3.03bn for projects funded in 2019 to £1.29bn for projects funded in 2020. The NCRI said several of its partners have had to make redundancies and take difficult decisions about priorities in order to maintain their research funding commitments. And it is not clear if funding will bounce back. “We are concerned that – due to the substantial decrease in the number and lifetime value of the new cancer research funded – the spend on cancer research could continue to decline over the next few years,” said the body’s chief executive officer, Dr Iain Frame. “This is because as existing projects that have been funded come to an end, there may not be new projects to replace them.” Cancer prevention was one of the main areas affected by the drop in funding, while bladder cancer and cancer of the small intestine were among the types of the disease worst hit. According to Cancer Research UK, there are more than 10,000 new cases of bladder cancer in the UK each year, and 5,500 deaths, with 49% of cases preventable. Charities have previously raised concerns about the financial impact of the pandemic on their ability to help fight cancer, warning it could last for years. Dr Iain Foulkes, executive director of research and innovation at Cancer Research UK, said the data from NCRI reflects the impact that the charity had felt from the first year of the pandemic. “Successive lockdowns forced the closure of our shops, fundraising events were cancelled and volunteering activities stopped, all of which limited our ability to raise money,” he said. Foulkes added that while it was initially expected that Cancer Research UK would see a £300m drop in income over three years, the figure is now expected to be about £250m thanks to the reopening of shops and events and other support. “This drop in income has disrupted our research funding streams, but we have been able to minimise the impact on our portfolio of ongoing research, protect our research base, and limit the damage to researchers’ careers,” he said. “If our financial performance continues to exceed expectations in future years, then increasing spending on research is Cancer Research UK’s top priority.” ",News/Society,"UK cancer research studies fell 32% in first year of Covid, say charities",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/08/uk-cancer-research-studies-fell-32-in-first-year-of-covid-say-charities
3/8/2022,"British food producers are facing surging prices for fertiliser, animal feed and CO2, which is used in packaging and the slaughter of livestock, as war in Ukraine disrupts exports from Russia and ramps up production costs. Fertiliser prices are surging towards £1,000 a tonne, up from about £650 last week, linked to a surge in the price of gas – key to the production process – and panic-buying by farmers fearing the price will rise further in the coming weeks. The NFU said prices for nitrogen fertiliser were already up 200% year on year. Farmers said they were likely to offset the price rises by buying less fertiliser than usual this season for cereal crops, potentially leading to lower production at a time when there is a threat to supplies from Ukraine, in peacetime responsible for 12% of the world’s wheat. Matt Culley, a Hampshire wheat and oilseed farmer who is head of the crops board at the National Farmers’ Union, said the new surge in fertiliser prices was adding to pressure on farmers already hit by rising labour, fuel and feed costs. “We’ve been suffering agricultural inflation,” he said. Culley said higher fertiliser prices meant greater risks for farmers because it would mean more investment in the face of other potential threats to the growing season, such as poor weather or a drop in demand without a guaranteed price for crops. He said he planned to use 20% less fertiliser, but would plant a greater area of land with crops in order to try to maintain yields and support UK production. Culley said some farmers may try to use more organic fertilisers by partnering with livestock producers or those running anaerobic digesters, which make energy from organic matter. While the UK produces about 40% of its own fertiliser, there are fears that plants may shut down operations as gas prices soar. That would also put a squeeze on the production of CO2 – released as a byproduct of the process – which is currently partly protected under an industry deal due to last until May. Yara, one of the world’s biggest producers of fertiliser, which operates in 50 countries including the UK, has said it is making day-to-day evaluations on how to maintain supply and that it is too early to say if more shutdowns may be on the cards. “Things are changing by the hour,” its boss, Svein Tore Holsether, told the BBC. “We were already in a difficult situation before the war … and now it’s additional disruption to the supply chains.” Meanwhile, Russia is the world’s biggest exporter of synthetic fertiliser, supplying more than a fifth of urea, a key fertiliser used in the UK. It has put restrictions on exports, and supplies are also being dented by ships avoiding Russian ports while insurers will not cover the cargo amid fears it will be hit by a trade embargo. Julia Meehan, head of fertilisers for the commodity price agency ICIS, said: “All everybody is talking about is availability. There are huge concerns.” She said prices had been suspended for exports from the Black Sea region as distributors tried to judge the correct new price – an unprecedented situation that could also have a huge effect on costs for north African and Turkish importers. “The only plus is that crop prices are now so high, farmers will be able to sell at a high price and technically they will have the money to pay for fertilisers,” Meehan said. The situation is likely to throw the spotlight on a €455m deal by EuroChem, a conglomerate controlled by the Russian billionaire Andrei Melnichenko, to buy the nitrogen fertiliser business of Austria’s Borealis, which was agreed last month and is awaiting regulatory approval. The deal would extend the reach into Europe of EuroChem, which is a major producer of fertiliser in Russia, despite being headquartered in Switzerland.",News/Business,Surge in fertiliser prices adds to pressure on UK farmers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/08/surge-in-fertiliser-prices-adds-to-pressure-on-uk-farmers
3/8/2022,"With a people under attack in dire need of help, and medical supplies vital to treat the wounded, doctors from across the NHS have been gathering kit, drugs and equipment to take to Ukraine. On Thursday a convoy of cars, trucks and ambulances will start the long drive from London to the Poland/Ukraine border, carrying tons of much needed stock donated by hospitals, GP surgeries and drug companies. Once there, some of the medics will start deploying their skills in field hospitals in the war-ravaged country while others help those in refugee camps in Poland displaced by the conflict. All will help relieve the suffering caused by the Russian invasion. The initiative has been organised by Medical Aid Ukraine, a newly formed group of doctors from across the UK who are collecting donations from hospitals, GP surgeries and drug companies. It is headed by Dr Roman Cregg, a specialist in pain management at University College London hospital, who was born in Lviv, near Ukraine’s western border. He is taking time off from his NHS role to coordinate the convoy, which on its journey to Poland will join up with several carloads of doctors in France and Germany undertaking the same mission. He plans to travel over the Poland/Ukraine border into his homeland and work in a field hospital. Other doctors, including anaesthetists and surgeons, will do the same, he said. His wife, Giovanna Russo, a London GP, will stay in Poland to help out in a refugee camp. Cregg is determined to do what he can to help fellow Ukrainian medics tend to those suffering from gunshot wounds, smoke inhalation and burns. “It feels right to do everything you can to help your country,” he said. “There is simply no question – doctors must help other doctors in this situation wherever possible. “We have seen our Ukrainian colleagues [in the NHS] being recalled to serve as army medics to support their country, leaving their loved ones behind in the UK.” Ukraine’s ministries of health and defence tell Medical Aid Ukraine what supplies they need most and then its network sets to work doing its best to source them from willing donors. “Half of all NHS hospitals have made donations to us already”, said Cregg. His trust has already donated boxloads of supplies including surgical masks, gowns and gloves. As with many hospitals’ donations, most are stocks that have expired or are close to expiry or are no longer needed because Covid has ebbed. One Medical Aid Ukraine member, Dr Sophie Wallace, a lecturer in clinical medical education, has arranged for private pilots to fly donated equipment from various parts of the UK. Another member, Dr Malgorzata Starczewska, an intensive care specialist who works at a major trauma centre, has sourced the equipment needed to put together intensive units in Ukraine and is in talks with a Polish airline to transport that to Poland. Dr Alicja Jasinka-Piadlo, an A&E doctor in Northern Ireland, is taking unpaid leave to work in a refugee camp in Poland. She has previously undertaken similar work in 2015, in the “jungle” camp in Calais, along the Austrian border and also at train stations, when a record 1.3m migrants and refugees came to Europe. Dr Rebecca Cranfield, an emergency medicine doctor in Edinburgh, has mobilised the On-Call Room, a network of 11,400 medics that she runs, to donate to help Medical Aid Ukraine raise the funds to cover the cost of both equipment and transporting the supplies to Poland. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, praised the doctors’ initiative. “I am incredibly proud of the work being done by our colleagues, and it speaks to the courage and kindness displayed by NHS staff on a daily basis that so many are going above and beyond, either by helping to coordinate deliveries of supplies or providing medical support on the ground,” he said.",News/UK news,Doctors from across NHS gather drugs and equipment to take to Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/08/doctors-nhs-gather-drugs-equipment-take-ukraine
