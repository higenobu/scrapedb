1/9/2022,"The comeback kings come back. Of course they do. Harlequins, given all the assistance they could have asked for by the red card shown to Alec Hepburn on the stroke of half-time for his clear-out of Joe Marler, did their level best to butcher the chance of a more comfortable victory, but prevailed at the death with a try by André Esterhuizen and the subsequent conversion by Marcus Smith - from the touchline, obviously. A rerun of the final across the road last season this may have been, but Exeter had looked as if they were going to rewrite the script with a gutsy effort in adversity. Quins had missed opportunity after opportunity, their line-out also letting them down time and again, but Smith’s cross-field kick at the death took advantage of Exeter’s absent man. Esterhuizen had a clear run to the puddle in the corner.  Smith nailed the kick, in off the post, to confirm his penchant for the big moments. The game was in the balance, a try apiece, when Hepburn was shown his red. There were shades of Brian O’Driscoll and the Lions tour of 2005. Unlike then, though, a shade of red was flourished from the referee’s pocket. Sam Simmonds and Hepburn went to clear out Marler, each focusing on a leg. Before he knew it, Marler was upside down, then landing on his head. There is no doubt it looked ugly. The decision to send off Hepburn was relatively straightforward, even if the clear-out happened so quickly and in conjunction with another player. Exeter took the decision to withdraw the winger Facundo Cordero, which was an equally sound decision, given the rain of the second half. The absence of Cordero would be felt keenly, however, by Quins as much as anyone. Twice in the third quarter his absence was exposed, but twice the opportunity squandered. Tyrone Green represents as much as anyone the brilliance with which Quins took the title last season. This, though, was not his finest hour. Cadan Murley was put away down the left, and fed Green on the inside. Not only was he run down, but his pass missed both players in the clear outside him, with another screaming on his inside. A few minutes later, Green flung another pass into touch when finding Joe Marchant with the line at his mercy might have been the easier task. Exeter surprised that third quarter, and soon they worked their way via a couple of penalties to where they are happiest, deep in opposition territory. Quins stymied their first attempts to drive line-outs, then turned them over, then fumbled their own line-out into touch. Exeter had another chance. Down to 14 they may have been, but 12 players joined the maul to drive Jack Innard over. Joe Simmonds missed the conversion from out wide. The stage was set for Smith’s customary heroics.",Sport/Sport,Marcus Smith snatches thrilling win for wasteful Harlequins against Exeter,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/08/harlequins-exeter-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
1/9/2022,"Brentford are through to the FA Cup fourth round and Port Vale can only ponder what might have been after a pell-mell second half in which they dominated yet still conceded three times. Trailing by one at the break, Darrell Clarke’s League Two team gave their Premier League opponents a mighty scare via Ben Garrity, David Worrall, Kian Harratt and Lewis Cass, who led the charge before, finally, their visitors pulled away It means there is no repeat of Vale’s famous FA Cup giant-killings of Everton (1996) or Tottenham (1988), who were both beaten 2-1 here.  For this, Brentford can thank Bryan Mbeumo, whose substitute appearance featured a 21-minute hat-trick the last a late penalty the Frenchman won before scoring. Worrall, one of six Vale changes, had given the Bees an early scare via a burst along his right wing-back corridor though he was unable to finish. This roused the Vale Park faithful but it was Thomas Frank’s men who would control the opening half, Mads Bidstrup to the fore from midfield. With Marcus Forss the lone striker the Bees were either patient – waiting for the No 9 to spring in behind – or direct as when Dominic Thompson sent in a steepling cross that the home defence, dangerously, allowed to bounce before scrambling clear. In Forss the visitors, who showed eight changes, had a physical focal point who was happy to bounce off Nathan Smith, Aaron Martin and Cass, the centre-backs in Clarke’s 3-5-2. It was the Finn who opened the scoring. Due to Covid Vale had not played for a month and the rustiness, plus the gulf in talent, was evident when they were breached. Brentford’s best performers were allowed to combine too easily as Bidstrup ran from inside his half and found Forss, whose finish, rifled in from the right of Aidan Stone, left the goalkeeper scant chance. At 1-0 anything could still happen, of course. A James Wilson ball in behind for his striker partnerDavid Amoo that Kristoffer Ajer did well tocut out was a bright start to Vale’s second half. So, too, a Garrity surge that ended with a curving cross that yielded a corner. This was Vale’s most sustained phase of pressure. Amoo was joined by Harratt – on for Wilson – and they upped tempo, hassling Brentford’s backline or dropping deep, as the substitute did to lay the ball off and initiate an attack. Garrity will surely rue, though, how he decided to pass to Harratt rather than pull the trigger when Worrall was next to break, along the right. The home fans broke into renditions of “Vale, Vale” and “stand up if you love the Vale”, in what was now a tingling Cup atmosphere. Garrity’s pace had become a real weapon. His latest surge along the right was followed by a ball in that had Cass volleying what looked set to be a memorable equaliser before it was blocked. Yet what came next was undeniable class from Brentford. Bidstrup, quiet all half, awoke, his swerve into space as admirable as the ball that had Mads Bech Sørensen racing towards goal. He found Mbeumo, who made no mistake. If this quietened Vale fans they were soon to go ballistic as Harratt threw himself at a cross and beat Jonas Lossl to his left. It set up a grandstand finish and from the very next Vale attack Worrall hit Garrity in the area, he turned back to Cass, who blazed at goal only to see it go wide. Seconds later Worrall, at close range, squeezed the ball against Lossl’s left post but Brentford escaped. They were in a true fight now. Worrall this time dropped a cross onto Garrity’s head but the effort was too high. Before this Dennis Politic, another of Clarke’s replacements, rounded the onrushing Lossl but from an angle on the left miscued badly. In a classic passage of topsy-turvy Cup play Brentford now hit their third – the excellent Mbeumo hittting a zinger of a left-foot shot from distance that pinged in off Stone’s right post. This was cruel for Vale and their support – as was the final score, secured by Mbeumo’s late penalty.",Sport/Football,Mbeumo hat-trick helps Brentford see off Cup challenge of valiant Port Vale,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/08/port-vale-brentford-fa-cup-match-report
1/9/2022,"Lewis Ludlow’s late pushover try ultimately proved pivotal as Gloucester claimed a first win at Saracens since 2008 to serve notice of their playoff push. Ludlow went over with eight minutes to go and though Alex Lewington’s score in the left corner gave Alex Lozowski the chance to win the match for Saracens with the conversion he pushed it wide and Gloucester saw out the final few minutes to seal victory. It was a difficult kick but Lozowski will rue striking the post with a straightforward conversion minutes earlier.  That said, victory was nothing less than Gloucester deserved. Ruan Ackermann and Jordy Reid shone in the back-row but they had notable performances all over the pitch. Many teams have come here, put in a decent shift for half an hour or so and crumbled but Gloucester were resolute to the last and were worthy winners. Saracens outscored their opponents four tries to three – they can take solace in collecting two bonus points – but this goes down as a first league win of the season at home and ensures they sign off for Europe on a sour note. Take nothing away from Gloucester, however, who have put last weekend’s narrow defeat by Harlequins behind them and cemented their hold on fourth spot. Saracens took a slender lead into the half-time interval after an opening half that took a while to heat up but soon simmered along nicely. Both sides went into the sheds with two tries apiece – Gloucester arguably the happier of the two sides having had to weather two yellow cards to Santiago Carreras and Ludlow. The visitors had scored the opening try with 15 players on the pitch, succeeding where Northampton had failed last weekend by boldly kicking two early penalties to the corner, the second yielding a pushover try for the prop Fraser Balmain. Adam Hastings could not convert, however, and Carreras was soon in the sin-bin for a deliberate knock-on. Alex Goode kicked the penalty to the corner and after Ludlow illegally brought down the maul, Dom Morris wriggled over for Saracens after a fine dummy. Ludlow was given his marching orders but Gloucester almost held out until Rotimi Segun danced his way over after another Saracens maul was repelled. Already you wondered if the writing was on the wall for Gloucester but from the kick-off, Carreras – only just back on the field – knocked back the restart, allowing Reid to rampage down the right. At first glance his pass to Jack Singleton – another impressive performer – appeared to be forward but after a brief check with the TMO the referee Karl Dickson awarded the try to the former Saracens hooker. Gloucester were buoyant by this stage and another penalty was kicked to the corner, resulting in a yellow card for Mako Vunipola for illegally infringing at the maul. A Ben Earl turnover ensured Saracens went into the break ahead but the hosts had been given fair warning by a resilient Gloucester side. Indeed, Gloucester nosed ahead with a Hastings penalty on 52 minutes but Saracens’ response was emphatic. Within seconds of coming on Theo McFarland charged down Charlie Chapman’s box-kick and the bounce favoured the Saracens replacement, who cruised over. Lozowski struck the upright with a straightforward conversion however and ultimately it proved costly with Ludlow having the final say with eight minutes remaining. Hastings converted and another late penalty was to prove decisive as, though Saracens hit back with a fine try in the left corner from Lewington, Lozowski was unable to convert from the touchline, ensuring Gloucester held on for a statement victory.",Sport/Sport,Lewis Ludlow stuns Saracens to edge Gloucester to Premiership victory ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/08/saracens-gloucester-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
1/9/2022,"As a boy Joe Ironside idolised Alan Shearer and relished watching the England centre forward play for Newcastle United at St James’ Park. On Saturday Ironside was back on Tyneside wearing the No 9 shirt for Cambridge United and the Middlesbrough-born forward scored a goal Shearer would have treasured to give Mark Bonner’s superb League One side the sort of giantkilling triumph that makes the FA Cup third round so special.  Cambridge are 41 rungs down the League ladder beneath Newcastle but you would not have known it for much of a tie that ended with Eddie Howe’s side still having won only one game all season and Bonner’s players cavorting across the pitch and hugging everyone in sight. Around the 10-minute mark the first choruses of “Premier League, you’re having a laugh,” drifted down from the top tier of the Leazes End where the 5,000 travelling Cambridge fans were housed. Their team had started well, defending with industry, intelligence and compactness as they persistently second guessed the intentions of a strong Newcastle starting XI. Although Kieran Trippier raised the tone courtesy of some high calibre touches on his debut at right-back, Howe’s side initially played with a distinct uncertainty. After registering only one victory since August, Newcastle frequently did not seem to trust their ability and instincts, often taking a touch too many or delaying a pass a couple of seconds too long. One of the few players who seems immune to such introspection, and knows better than to overthink things, is Allan Saint-Maximin but even Howe’s great improviser initially found himself cleverly shadowed by his League One minders. Moreover Saint-Maximin suffering the indignity of, on more than one occasion, being all too easily brushed aside by Bonner’s captain, Paul Digby. Deployed in a defensive midfield role, Digby served as a quasi-sweeper, screening the visiting backline impressively. With the home passing radar somewhat awry and pressing game malfunctioning slightly, Cambridge sensed opportunity and their centre-forward, Ironside, troubled Howe’s back four. Yet when an unmarked George Williams found himself presented with a free header he could only direct it straight at Martin Dubravka who saved comfortably. At this stage Howe cut an uneasy technical area figure – even if Trippier’s tone-raising cameos afforded him a degree of reassurance. As befits the first established England international to sign for Newcastle since Michael Owen in 2005, the former Atlético Madrid full-back received a rapturous reception from his new public. Yet for much of the first half even Trippier’s right-wing deliveries seemed to be hitting a wall in the shape of Bonner’s commanding centre-half Jubril Okedina and his fellow defenders. Even so, the excellent Dimitar Mitov made some important saves as the interval approached, Cambridge’s goalkeeper performing acrobatic wonders to twice deny Jacob Murphy and then Saint-Maximin after the latter finally began confounding his markers. The moment Mitov somehow tipped Murphy’s volley on to the bar will linger in the memory. At the other end, Ironside retained a capacity to unnerve Emil Krafth and Fabian Schär and Bonner appealed for a penalty when Harvey Knibbs collapsed in the area after appearing to be tugged back by Matt Ritchie but, contentiously, a VAR review revealed no foul. Schär is often much better at creating than deconstructing and the Switzerland defender briefly thought he had scored Newcastle’s breakthrough goal after tapping in the fallout from a Ritchie corner but he was well offside and the score remained goalless. Murphy had a “goal” disallowed for offside early in the second period but it was not long before Ironside showed a stunned St James’ Park precisely how it should be done. When Newcastle failed to clear a loose ball, in the wake of Schär heading Adam May’s shot off the line, Bonner’s key striker pounced, swivelling sharply before lashing the ball beyond the helpless Dubravka. Newcastle’s goalkeeper injured himself in the process, playing on in apparent pain. After an inordinately long VAR check for a possible offside, the goal was given and now Howe, who immediately introduced Miguel Almirón and Joe Willock, faced the challenge of somehow undoing Bonner’s narrow configuration that was turning into a daunting yellow wall. In between defending the Cambridge substitute Jack Lankester thought he had scored his side’s second goal after shooting beneath Dubravka but he had strayed fractionally offside. No matter; Ironside had already done enough.",Sport/Football,Joe Ironside dumps out Newcastle to put Cambridge in FA Cup dreamland ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/08/newcastle-cambridge-united-fa-cup-match-report
1/9/2022,"Snow and ice are expected to hit parts of the UK this weekend as bands of rain move in from the west, the Met Office has warned. Western Scotland, Northern Ireland, north-west England and north Wales are forecast to experience frosty conditions as downpours continue into Sunday morning.  Flood alerts are in place across England and Wales, with the Environment Agency issuing 11 in England and six in Wales, as well as one flood warning in Walsden, West Yorkshire. Most of England’s flood alerts are in the country’s south-west and north-west, with just one in the East of England, in Norfolk. Flood alerts mean flooding is possible, while a warning signifies that flooding is expected. In the event of an alert, people are advised to prepare a bag that includes medicines and insurance documents and monitor for a change to warning, while those living in a flood warning zone are to turn off gas, water and electricity and move their family, pets, belongings and car to safety. Areas in the Scottish Highlands could see the mercury plummet to -4C on Saturday night, but most parts of the UK are expected to hover around a slightly warmer average of 2C. As well as in northern Scotland, snow is likely to fall in the Pennines and Snowdonia before the weekend is up. Met Office meteorologist Jonathan Vautrey said: “There are no official ice warnings out at the moment that we have issued but we are sending out a message in general that there is an isolated risk that any wet surfaces along with these showers could lead to icy stretches. This is mainly due to the showers that will be feeding in to the west.” Vautrey said most of the ice will probably have melted away before Sunday morning. “Most of the ice risk will have abated before people are getting out and about,” he said.",News/UK news,Snow and ice expected to hit parts of UK this weekend,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/08/snow-and-ice-expected-to-hit-parts-of-uk-this-weekend
1/9/2022,"The Coming Storm (BBC Radio 4/World Service) | BBC SoundsNow, Where Were We? with Barry Cryer and Bob Cryer (Acast)Gemma Cairney Gets Classical (Scala Radio) | scalaradio.co.uk Excuse me for a moment. I’ve just finished binge-listening to The Coming Storm, the new seven-episode BBC series about contemporary US politics – the fringier, loopier end of US politics – and now my brain is burnt and my synapses are frazzled.  Mind-frying is, of course, to be expected. It’s what happens if you spend too long thinking about internet conspiracy nonsense. Hello birds, hello sky, hello absolute tosh about the world being run by a coordinated baby-eating and paedophile network, centred on Hillary Clinton. And hello to the good old dark underbelly of America, the longstanding subject of every keen British reporter with a microphone and a ticket to the US. The Coming Storm initially seems to be about something else, with host reporter Gabriel Gatehouse telling us he had the idea for the programme when he did an online sketching class. A red herring. Actually, his real question is pretty standard: what was behind the storming of the Capitol building on 6 January last year? Gatehouse watched it on TV, as we all did, but when he saw Jake Angeli, AKA the “QAnon shaman”, the guy in the Viking horn hat and the furs, he thought: “Uh oh.” Because a couple of months earlier, Gatehouse had met Angeli, but hadn’t interviewed him. He’d thought the Trump Jamiroquai was too much of an outlier nut. When Gatehouse began discussing this, my heart sank. I’ve had my fill of programmes about “Q drops”, pizzagate, the poisonous message boards of 4chan, 8chan and the horrible results of all of the resulting conspiracy theories. Anyone with half an eye on the news – or an active Facebook account – has been aware of the underlying QAnon story for quite some time. Even if you’ve never heard of QAnon, there have been umpteen “Blimey, what’s going on in America?” explanatory podcasts. The idea of another one, made because a hack felt like he’d missed his scoop, was not appealing. Luckily, The Coming Storm is more than a going-over of old ground. Gatehouse is trying to paint a broader picture, attempting to explain why the (untrue) stories of a paedophile elite/great awakening/stolen election are believed by so many people. He looks at the background, from ye olde cover-up of Bill Clinton’s sexual shenanigans in the 90s, to recent Facebook algorithm changes, to opportunistic Republican co-opting of fringe beliefs – and tries to understand why this all means that normal people can be convinced of abnormal things. He does this very well, though the programme necessarily goes over some familiar territory. I kept being reminded of two podcasts in particular: Nicky Woolf’s Finding Q: My Journey Into QAnon and Jon Ronson’s Things Fell Apart. (Both shows were in my top 10 audio of 2021.) Gatehouse interviews the founder of the 8chan message board, Fredrick Brennan, who features heavily in Finding Q. He goes to a QAnon conference, as Woolf’s series does. Later, he talks to an expert about the “satanic panic” of the 1980s, which was examined in Ronson’s show. He also touches on how ordinary Americans get on to school boards and neighbourhood councils and use their positions to further their own interests (obsessions). Ronson covered this, too. Woolf and Ronson concentrate on small incidents as a way of illustrating something larger. Gatehouse’s canvas is broader, not as laser-focused. This means that the programmes can feel scattered – why is he talking to this particular person? – though he manages to pull it all together in the end. Also because of his wide remit, Gatehouse’s conclusion – that 6 January isn’t the end of something, but the beginning – feels woolly. But we can forgive him that. This is an epic effort that brings together several disparate strands into an explanatory, thoroughly scary whole. Excellent production and music work throughout, too. After all that, some light relief. And look! Barry Cryer, whom I love, has a new podcast, Now, Where Were We? In it, the 86-year-old comedy veteran has a chat with a chum in the pub over a pint or two. His son Bob is there too, setting up the microphone and slightly steering the conversation. Barry himself is just here for the stories, and this is an elderly version of a bro-pod. Anecdote after anecdote ensues; tales of Morecambe and Wise, of The Goon Show, of Tony Hancock, of funny funerals and pun-filled panel shows. It’s relentless, exhausting. Stephen Fry and Danny Baker are Cryer’s first interviewees, and each is given two shows almost an hour long. A tougher editing button is required, or at least a few mattress adverts. Gemma Cairney, upbeat veteran of 1Xtra, 6 Music and Radio 4, has a new Sunday night show on Scala Radio. The idea is that she’ll mix classical tracks with her more usual musical choices, learning along the way. At least I think that’s the idea: it wasn’t explained very well. This show needs stronger production. Cairney is most comfortable when talking to others, and could have done with a couple of interviews or a short feature, chatting to a listener about their favourite composer, for instance. This would have given a more solid structure, rather than Cairney occasionally explaining that she doesn’t have much classical knowledge. Still, she’s a warm and lovely broadcaster. With a few adjustments, this could be an excellent, mind-and-synapse-soothing show.",Arts/Television & radio,"The week in audio: The Coming Storm; Now, Where Were We?; Gemma Cairney Gets Classical",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/08/the-coming-storm-review-gabriel-gatehouse-bbc-qanon-conspiracy-movement-now-where-were-we-podcast-barry-cryer-bob-gemma-cairney-gets-classical
1/9/2022,"The death of Sidney Poitier is a moment of great sadness for many, but especially for people like my parents, who remember him being the first Black actor they ever saw on TV. Raised in the Bahamas by tomato farmers, he was the youngest of seven children and came from extreme poverty. He moved to New York aged 16, where he worked as a dishwasher, took acting lessons and taught himself how to read, write and enunciate by reading newspapers and listening to the radio. He was the definition of a self-made man. When he won an Academy Award for best actor in 1964, he was the first Black person to do so. He was proud of his victory but, admirably, wasn’t blinded by it. “I don’t believe my Oscar will be a sort of magic wand that will wipe away restrictions on job opportunities for negro actors,” he said in an interview. He wasn’t wrong. It would be 38 years before another Black person (Denzel Washington) would win a best actor Oscar.  Poitier’s authenticity, whether thoughtfully navigating the racial politics of Hollywood or turning down roles that he felt were typecast, made him more than just an actor, but a formidable force in setting a precedent for Black actors in leading roles. “I had to satisfy the action fans, the romantic fans, the intellectual fans. It was a terrific burden.” He was a trailblazer who carved out a path for the likes of Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg, Will Smith, to name a few. A year ago, I was given a record player by fellow poet Malika Booker and I welcomed it with open arms. Throughout my early 20s, I bought vintage items such as typewriters and sewing machines purely for the aesthetics, but something about the pandemic and turning 30 made me wander into the wilderness of analogue. Vinyl sales in the UK took its highest market share since 1990 in 2021. As a child of Limewire, I came of age at the onset of digital streaming and I love the convenience of Spotify. But hearing Grace Jones’s 1981 album Nightclubbing on vinyl for the first time felt transcendent. Brandon Taylor recently wrote about the experience beautifully: “You can’t mistake it for some imaginary thing that comes out of the air like digital can sometimes be. With a record, you know there’s another person on the other side of the music.” I wish I had known sooner that streaming takes away so much of the ritualistic magic of music. Of course, saying: “Hey Google, play I’ve Done it Again” is an effortless act, but whenever I take a record from its sleeve, set it down and delicately lower the needle, I feel I’ve achieved something. Perhaps that’s why I bought some disposable cameras before a recent trip to the Lake District. There are 26,186 photographs on my iPhone, so I clearly lack self-control. But with only 27 exposures on a disposable, I took my time. I waited for good light. I enjoyed learning the art of composition. Wise up, Molly-Mae A clip from an interview with 22-year-old influencer, ex-Love Island star and PrettyLittleThing’s creative director Molly-Mae Hague has been circulating on social media, in which she quotes the internet’s favourite proverb: “We all have the same 24 hours as Beyoncé.” I hate this productivity-shaming axiom that seems to forget that Beyoncé employs six nannies. This mythical belief that ‘‘working hard” is the answer to success is just another way to call poor people lazy. When people talk about working hard, they rarely mean working to the best of your abilities. They mean working for nothing, accepting low pay and compromising ethical and moral standards and don’t even think about sleeping. What Hague fails to realise is that success is unlikely a consequence of graft alone. In most cases, it’s down to privilege, luck, geography, nepotism and, more often than not, exploitation. Does she think that her seven-figure deal with PrettyLittleThing came from working her “absolute arse off” and not from the fact that the brand, owned by Boohoo, was selling clothes made by workers paid as little as £3.50 an hour?

Police said a manslaughter investigation is under way and are appealing for information after the fatal incident at a lock-up garage on Southwold Road in Clapton.  Ermal Quose, 35, who was an Albanian national and had no known address in the UK, was taken to hospital and died on Sunday. His family has been informed.

Police said a 33-year-old man was arrested that day on suspicion of false imprisonment and cannabis cultivation and has been released under investigation.

DCI Mark Rogers, who is leading the investigation, said: “Ermal tragically lost his life having been trapped inside the locked garage which was being used for the cultivation of cannabis when the fire broke out. My thoughts and sympathies are with his family.” He urged people who were in the area on New Year’s Eve or with knowledge of the garage to come forward. “If you can assist and have not yet spoken with police, please get in touch. “I am also calling on those who choose to ignore the many and obvious issues caused by their own use of illegal drugs to reflect on Ermal’s death.

1/9/2022,"Until a month ago, pub landlord Scott Jones knew only a handful of people who had got Covid. But since then, the majority of the people he knows have had the virus – including his young son, his assistant, who was off work for 10 days, and the people he depends on to deliver supplies to his Chelmsford pub, the Railway Tavern.“It was like the perfect storm, it all happened at once,” said Jones, 40, who was left trying to juggle it all with his partner, on top of a 40% drop in pub takings. “There’s so many knock-on effects of it. Every day seems to bring a new challenge.”The Essex city is just one of many places up and down the country increasingly struggling to function properly due to Covid staff shortages – affecting everything from bin collections to the local hospital and football team. According to the latest government figures, on Friday there were 410 new cases reported in Chelmsford and one death. In the first week of January, there were 3,198 new cases recorded.   Following issues with certain lagers and CO2 during previous phases of the pandemic, Jones said the latest delivery issues have centred on wine. At the same time, as Covid cases continue to rise, he is worried about the prospect of another lockdown, which he does not think the pub could survive.“Usually at this time on a Friday every table would be taken and I’d have three staff working,” he said, standing alone behind the bar, above which a sign reads “desperate times call for double measures”.Customer Phil Elliott, 61, an artist, said he has felt the impact of staff shortages on buses, which are running on a reduced timetable due to “higher than normal” staff sickness caused by Omicron.At the bus station, a driver said absences are the worst they have been throughout the whole of the pandemic and that they are cutting over 1,600 miles a day of journeys. “It’s stressful,” he said. First Essex apologised to customers and said they are doing everything they can to minimise disruption and that teams are “working extra hard to ensure as many buses run as is possible”.Meanwhile, at Broomfield Hospital staff are understood to be struggling with extra work and stress as growing numbers of staff fall ill. “Broomfield staff have never known a crisis like this. They’re absolutely wrung out from almost two years of near-constant emergency footing,” said Sam Older, eastern regional organiser at Unison, which is calling for an above-inflation pay rise for NHS staff. “With Omicron running riot, more and more are falling ill. Those left are contending with not only the fear of the virus, but the extra work and stress from the shortages.”Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, which oversees the hospital, said Omicron is leading to “higher levels of staff absence”. A spokesperson added: “Our staff are working tirelessly to minimise the impact of this and we have robust plans in place to ensure that patients who urgently need our care continue to receive it.”Meanwhile, collections of food-waste bins were cancelled for three days last week after 23 drivers – 40% of their total drivers – were off sick following the Christmas break. Councillor Stephen Robinson, the Liberal Democrat leader of Chelmsford City Council, noted that it marked the first change to bin collections of the pandemic. “It was very much an emergency decision, and this week we’re now largely back on track,” he said. He said managing services amid soaring infection rates had been a challenge and that leisure centres were having to move staff around to cover for absences. But, he added: “By and large, Chelmsford City Council has coped very well and services have kept running throughout the pandemic.”Even the football team has been taken down by Covid. Chelmsford City’s match against Braintree Town had to be postponed last Sunday because so many Chelmsford players had tested positive. And for Saturday’s match, against Bath City, Chelmsford’s manager, Robbie Simpson, who has also tested positive, was preparing to coach them remotely via a livestream from isolation.“Within the space of just over a week we’ve gone from having next to no-one to almost everybody, so it’s been crazy,” said Simpson.As an NHS worker, Simpson’s wife has had to work from home after his positive test, despite testing negative herself.Preparing for matches when many of the team have been quarantining has been tough. “Because obviously you can’t really prepare in advance because you never know when someone’s going to get a positive lateral flow,” he said.One player has converted his garage into a gym so that he can keep training while in isolation.“It seems like everybody’s getting it at the minute. Obviously, last week there was a big shortage on PCRs and some of the players had to wait at least a couple of days before they were able to get a PCR,” said Simpson. “So that just goes to show you how many people are having to get the PCR tests done … it seems to be affecting everybody and every industry.”",News/World news,Covid calls last orders at Chelmsford’s pubs,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/08/covid-calls-last-orders-at-chelmsfords-pubs

With the Treasury examining an expansion of a scheme designed to help the poorest with their energy bills, influential Tories are already saying that the plan will be too narrow and that the party will suffer big losses in May’s elections.  The elections, which take place across London, metropolitan boroughs and some county councils, are being regarded as the next major source of political danger for Boris Johnson. MPs are sounding the alarm because inflationary pressures are set to peak just weeks before voting takes place. Some Tories are already warning they will try to engineer a parliamentary clash with the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to force him into action. “I think it’s fair to say that the cost of living is one of the things that’s actually driving angst amongst MPs,” said Lord Hayward, the Tory peer and respected pollster. The MPs are conscious that the elections will be happening in the wake of increases in energy and national insurance charges due to come in three or four weeks earlier. “Large numbers of MPs have never been in a parliament where the government has been 15 points behind. This for them is a new experience to be even 6% or 7% behind, though the last two opinion polls have actually been better for the Tories,” Hayward said. “But certainly there is an angst amongst MPs who, confronted by 6% to 8% deficits, are looking towards their local elections.” The news comes as an Opinium poll for the Observer suggests households are already noticing price inflation. About 70% of voters said they had seen their cost of living increase more than their income over the last 12 months, despite reports of pay rises. A majority who voted Tory at the last election (57%) said they backed removing VAT from energy bills. One in eight voters (12%) would now describe their financial situation as “struggling”, up slightly from 9% from the end of lockdown in April. A huge majority of the public say they have noticed price rises. About 86% have noticed a rise in the overall cost of living, 83% a rise in grocery bills, 80% a rise in energy bills and 59% a rise in council tax. A likely remedy from the government will be an expansion of the £140 Warm Homes Discount aimed at the poorest households. However, Tories are already warning that expanding the scheme will be insufficient: some even suggested they would threaten to vote against this year’s budget without firmer action. “That is only for those on benefits, predominantly,” said one influential figure. “The just-about-managing are not helped. I hope that they introduce a green levy escalator that goes down when the wholesale energy price rises.” The government is receiving guidance that inflation could rise to as high as 7% if they fail to take action. Average annual fuel bills could rise from £1,300 to about £2,000 a year. “The whole timing of this cost of living increase, whether it’s caused by world factors such as energy prices or whether it’s caused by domestic factors such as increased taxes, is coming at a very awkward time,” said another party veteran. “Not only the local government elections, but just at a time when really everybody wants to sort of get beyond Covid. We’re all hoping that after this winter is over and Omicron doesn’t turn out as bad as everybody feared, we want to emerge from that and start to get our lives back. This whole cost of living thing – I think it’s going to become quite tricky for the government.” Energy regulator Ofgem is set to announce a rise of up to £700 in its price cap at the start of next month. Bills would increase from April, with the local elections set for 5 May. Tories have been demanding a cut to green levies, the end of VAT on energy bills or a reversal of a coming increase in national insurance to ease the pressure. Labour has so far backed cutting VAT on energy bills, but is also under pressure to go further. Stephen McPartland, the Tory MP for Stevenage, said that family finances were like a “leaky bucket that is getting leakier and leakier”. He called for the energy price cap not to be increased. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said there was now a “growing revolt in former Conservative heartlands against this government”. He added: “As we saw in North Shropshire, even lifelong Conservative voters are fed up with Johnson’s incompetence and lack of decency. His failure to act on the cost of living crisis is simply adding fuel to the fire.”",News/Politics,Tory MPs sound alarm over cost of living crisis as local elections loom,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/08/tory-mps-sound-alarm-over-cost-of-living-crisis-as-local-elections-loom
