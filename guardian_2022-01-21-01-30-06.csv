1/21/2022,"When Mani and Amy Baker-Floyd moved from London to Toronto with their toddler Zoe in September 2019, Mani didn’t expect to find it as thrilling a place to live as the British capital. “London is hard to compete with,” says Mani, a teacher. “It’s on the cutting edge of everything.” The couple had decided to give life in Canada a go because marketing expert Amy – who was born in Ontario but had lived in the UK for nearly a decade – felt ready to return to her roots. At the time, Mani, a keen outdoorsman who originates from Brighton, had no idea of the adventures that lay in store.  The family take the ferry to, and explore, the Toronto Islands “People never believe you can surf in Toronto, but it’s surprisingly good, with consistent waves for both beginners and more experienced surfers,” says Mani, about one of his most unexpected discoveries. The city, set on magnificent Lake Ontario, is home to a sport more often associated with tropical climates, and at Bluffer’s park in Toronto’s east, surfers from around the world converge in what Mani calls a “friendly, typically Canadian scene with plenty of camaraderie”. Mani surfing in Ashbridges Bay Of course, with Zoe, now four, to think of – and new arrival Noah, who’s not yet one – there’s only so much time for surfing. Thankfully, close to their home in the heart of the city, the Baker-Floyds have found plenty of family friendly adventures to keep them busy. The dinosaurs at the Royal Ontario Museum are a favourite of Zoe’s “We can be almost anywhere in about 30 minutes on the subway,” says Amy, who highlights the Royal Ontario Museum, the most visited in Canada, as a firm favourite with Zoe thanks to its gemstone gallery, dinosaur skeletons and tempting gift shop (she always manages to leave with a treat). Because the museum is so easy to get to, the family will often visit just one or two exhibits at a time, keeping things manageable for the kids. Another family favourite is the Ontario Science Centre, with its KidSpark packed full of child-friendly science fun. Around 20 minutes on the subway brings the family to Ripley’s Aquarium of Canada, home to all-ages sea life exhibits, while the McMichael Canadian Art Collection – where Zoe likes running around the outdoor sculptures – is a half-hour drive north of Toronto, in the village of Kleinburg. Clockwise from top left: the Royal Ontario Museum, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection and Ripley’s Aquarium of Canada are all within easy reach of Toronto Outdoor life shapes many of the family’s Toronto experiences because nature is never far away. Every weekend they head to High Park, which at 162 hectares (400 acres) is larger than London’s Hyde Park, for its playground, outdoor swimming pool, ice-cream shop and ice-skating rink. And, especially in summer, the family pays regular visits to the Toronto Islands, an exciting (but handily brief) boat ride from downtown. This chain of 15 small islands is home to restaurants, gardens, picnic sites and several beaches. High Park, visited by the family every weekend “People don’t realise Toronto has a beach scene,” says Amy, who points out that there is an abundance of swimming spots, even downtown. Mani, unsurprisingly for a Brit, loves the reliability of the Ontario summer weather: “Unlike in the UK, if you make a plan to visit the island on the weekend, you know it’s probably going to be sunny, hot and dry.” Beach breaks are a theme when it comes to the family’s Ontario explorations because there are so many within an hour or two’s drive of the city centre. Sandbanks’ white beach is the ideal spot for a quick dip Sandbanks, a two-and-a-half hour drive east of Toronto in Prince Edward County, is one such place. The soft white beach is not the only attraction – there’s a thriving wine region, trendy restaurants and smart hotels, such as the Drake Devonshire, a 30-minute drive away in Wellington. For a future visit, the family has the Mustang Drive-in movie theatre, in Bloomfield, six miles (10km) from the hotel, on its to-do list. As far as Amy is concerned, however, beach breaks don’t get better than Tiny Township in the southern Georgian Bay area, known for its beautiful beaches. “When I show friends photos of Balm beach, with its crystal blue waters and light sands, they always say, are you sure you’re not in the Bahamas?” she laughs. The warm, shallow waters, neighbouring ice-cream shop and on-tap mini golf mean that the family can laze by the beachfront all day. But there’s plenty else in the area to entice active types. Nearby Awenda provincial park, for example, has forest hiking trails plus campsites for pitching tents and roasting marshmallows. Tubing at Elora Gorge; Old Elora Mill Whether the Baker-Floyds are heading to Georgian Bay or to one of their other favourite Ontario getaways – including the Elora Gorge conservation area or Blue Mountain Resort’s hiking trails or approachable ski runs – the journey is always part of the fun. Passing through the typical Ontario towns, stuffed with farms and red-brick homes, provides real contrast to modern Toronto. “As a Brit, to me they feel straight out of the movies,” says Mani. “General store, cafe, cherry pie …” The couples’ top picks include Belfountain and Creemore, where they might stop off to buy butter tarts, an Ontarian flaky pastry with a gooey, sweet filling. Summer brings trips to the area’s pick-your-own farms (top) while autumn is the time to enjoy the changing colours of Forks of the Credit provincial park (below) Depending on the season, the Baker-Floyds will change up the particulars of their adventures. In summer, they might visit one of the dozens of pick-your-own farms, harvesting fresh strawberries, blueberries or peaches to show the children where fruit comes from. In autumn, they might drive under a “canopy of reds, yellows and oranges” in Forks of the Credit provincial park, a prime leaf-peeping spot. In winter, you might find them at Evergreen Brick Works, in Toronto, enjoying the holiday market or skating rink. Or popping to small child-friendly ski hills, just 45 minutes from Toronto’s centre. And that’s a key part of what they love about exploring Ontario as a family. “There’s something for every time of year,” says Amy. “Whether it’s walks in autumn, snowman-making in winter, swimming in summer, Ontario is an all-season place. And that affords you so many different opportunities.” To discover more about enjoying everything Ontario has to offer, head to destinationontario.com/uk","Welcome to Ontario, Canada","Bracing boat trips, dinosaurs and cherry pie: the best things to do with kids in Ontario",https://www.theguardian.com/welcome-to-ontario/2022/jan/20/bracing-boat-trips-dinosaurs-and-cherry-pie-the-best-things-to-do-with-kids-in-ontario
1/21/2022,"The US has alleged that Russian intelligence is recruiting current and former Ukrainian government officials to take over the government in Kyiv and cooperate with a Russian occupying force. The US Treasury has issued sanctions on two Ukrainian members of parliament and two former officials it said were involved in the alleged conspiracy, which involved discrediting the current government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.  “Russia has directed its intelligence services to recruit current and former Ukrainian government officials to prepare to take over the government of Ukraine and to control Ukraine’s critical infrastructure with an occupying Russian force,” the Treasury statement accompanying the sanctions said. The claims suggest US intelligence fears Russia is preparing to a full-scale invasion and not the “minor incursion” that Joe Biden referred to as a possibility in remarks on Wednesday. The two MPs sanctioned were named as Taras Kozak and Oleh Voloshyn, both members of a pro-Russian party led by Victor Medvedchuk, who has been under house arrest in Ukraine since last May, accused of treason. A former Ukrainian official, Volodymyr Oliynyk, now living in Russia, was sanctioned for working “at the direction of the FSB [Russian intelligence] to gather information about Ukrainian critical infrastructure”. The fourth man named is Vladimir Sivkovich, a former deputy secretary of the Ukrainian national security and defence council. “In 2021, Sivkovich worked with a network of Russian intelligence actors to carry out influence operations that attempted to build support for Ukraine to officially cede Crimea to Russia in exchange for a drawdown of Russian-backed forces in the Donbas,” the US treasury alleged. The four men could not immediately be reached for comment. Russia has denied it plans to invade Ukraine, but it has massed over 100,000 troops along the country’s border.

1/21/2022,"A group of international bondholders in embattled Chinese property developer Evergrande have hired an offshore law firm and warned of legal action if the company continues to refuse to “substantive engagement” over its finances and restructuring plans. The group of unnamed bondholders, which describe themselves in a statement as “large and reputable international investors with deep experience and high standing in the international capital markets”, said they have been forced to consider legal action after repeatedly receiving “little more than vague assurances of intent, lacking in both detail and substance”.  Operating under the acronym AHG, the group have added offshore law firm Harneys to its roster of advisers, which also includes lawyers Kirkland & Ellis and investment bank Moelis, who have been working with the bondholders since September. China’s second-biggest property developer, Evergrande has nearly $20bn of international market bonds that have been deemed to be in cross-default by ratings firms after missed payments, and has more than $300bn in total liabilities. “The AHG believes it has been left with no option but to seriously consider enforcement actions,” the bondholders said in a statement released on Thursday. “The AHG is prepared to take all necessary actions to vehemently defend its legal rights and protect its legitimate interests.” The bondholder group complained in October of a lack of engagement from Evergrande, which in December set up a risk management committee and repeatedly promised to engage with all stakeholders. Evergrande, which is embarking on one of China’s biggest ever restructuring processes, has now resumed work at more than 90% of its projects. However, the bondholder group said that it needs full transparency on the company’s plans and wants it to halt more asset sales unless it is consulted. “The AHG recognises the group’s recent efforts in resuming over 90% of its construction projects, and want to be a part of a solution to help the group during these hard times,” the letter said. “In this respect, the AHG requests the group to promptly engage with the AHG, provide full transparency in relation to the group’s financial position and liabilities and refrain from making any further asset disposals without consulting the AHG.” The bondholder group said it hoped that by making a public statement, and threatening legal action, it would “prompt immediate, meaningful and substantive actions and not just words” from Evergrande.",News/Business,Evergrande bondholders warn of legal action over ‘lack of engagement’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/20/evergrande-bondholders-warn-of-legal-action-over-lack-of-engagement
1/21/2022,"André Leon Talley loved the surprisingly similar rituals of two ways of life he knew well: the black community of his childhood in North Carolina, and French couture, with its historical and literary associations. His remarkable persona and work as fashion editor, adviser and seer were founded on church ladies in their Sunday best, and an encyclopedic knowledge of the history of clothes, their connections and meanings. Few couturiers knew a fraction of what he did, and the US Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who appointed him her shield – even in heels she stood small beside his 6ft 6in – admitted that he had what she lacked, a deep apprehension of fashion. Also he had prolific and exciting ideas.  Talley, who has died aged 73 of a heart attack, was in the front row of the Paris, and most other, shows for more than four decades, an enthusiastic warm island in an ocean of cool, as well as often the sole black presence. He could photograph, write, arrange shoots, wrangle supermodel super egos, broker ungettable interviews and covers, notably Michelle Obama as first lady, pick and back new design and modelling talent, and, most importantly, predict the future based on his passion for the past. Talley’s lofty standards matched Wintour’s own when the Condé Nast magazine empire was at its height in the late 1980s. Although Wintour said Talley sent her handwritten notes about his experiences with race, so “it was always bubbling under the surface”, he avoided the subject publicly, concentrating on his unique personal status in fashion, and self-invented fluid-in-all-aspects identity. Only in interviews publicising his second memoir, The Chiffon Trenches (2020), written after Winter had discarded him from Vogue without a word (a time-honoured magazine ritual), did he describe her as “a colonial broad”, on whose watch Condé Nast had remained undiversified in the office and on the page way into the 21st century. He felt he had been exploited as an exotic, and sometimes as ambassador for a black milieu; always the first to be bumped from a guest list. The released anger energised his last years. He had been creating identity and an unrepeatable career path since his childhood in Durham, North Carolina. Born in Washington to Alma (nee Davis) and William Talley, who had gone there to work as government clerks, from the age of two months he grew up in the Durham house of his grandmother Bennie Davis, for 50 years a cleaner of dormitories at nearby Duke University. She encouraged the boy to read and gave him his own shocking-pink painted study, while his father sent a set of encyclopedias. At nine he discovered Vogue in the public library and later walked to a newsstand on the white side of town after Sunday church to buy it. After Diana Vreeland arrived as editor in 1963, Vogue became Talley’s portal to a better planet. He read every caption, recognised the Beautiful People’s names, especially the French ones: he had been a Francophile since hearing Julia Child say “Bon appetit!” on her TV cooking show. He and Bennie took pleasure in clothes, and yearly boarded a bus to Washington or New York to buy the best that could be afforded on her earnings, and money from his father. He read Flaubert’s Madame Bovary on one trip, intending to teach French literature in high school. But his world widened, as he went on from North Carolina Central University on a scholarship to Brown University, Rhode Island, where he wrote a master’s thesis about black women in 19th-century French art and literature, and was picked up socially by wealthy white students from Rhode Island School of Design; he wrote for their college mag. They were his entree to New York, and, with a letter of introduction from one of their parents, to an unpaid internship in 1974 at the Metropolitan Museum Costume Institute, where Vreeland curated extraordinary exhibitions. She noticed his creative input, summoned him to her office, wrote “ANDRE – THE HELPER” on her pad, and ordered him to stay by her side to show’s end. He recognised her resemblance to Bennie, the same perfect clothes ritually maintained and tissue-paper-packed (albeit by her maids), the gloves, hard work and discipline. Vreeland found him a receptionist job on Andy Warhol’s Interview magazine, where he was taken out on the town by the Factory entourage, and did thorough research before talking to then relatively new Karl Lagerfeld. The designer was the first of many to dress Talley, tossing him custom-made shirts with matching mufflers at the end of the interview. Another Talley teen hero, John Fairfield of Women’s Wear Daily, recruited him and in 1978 sent him as bureau chief to Paris, where he felt he had ascended to his true heavenly home. The French could be hostile – a PR executive mocked him as “Queen Kong”, there were imbroglios over favoured couturiers (Talley approved Givenchy for his all-black model team) – and Talley left to freelance. In 1983, he moved in as news editor at US Vogue, under the command of Grace Mirabella, just as Wintour became its creative editor. When she was anointed editor in 1988, Talley took her old job, both a novelty – male, gay, African American – and a link with the vintage elegance of Vreeland’s era. In 1998, he was appointed editor-at-large. That title was somewhat unfortunate: after his grandmother’s death, Talley comfort-ate the food he associated with her kitchen, and his tall slenderness consolidated into girth beneath wonderful robes and capes sewn for him by major designers. Wintour and his pastor at the Abyssinian Baptist Church of Harlem persuaded Talley to book in for repeated clinic stays for his health, but the struggle with weight never abated. His belief in the power of pageantry to elevate lives (he was eloquent about dressing mourners for funerals), in careful selection, upkeep, and tissue paper, had fallen out of fashion, and in 2013, Vogue discarded him. There was no personal life to return to in his borrowed home in unchic White Plains, New York, nor had he got much money. Many fashion-world friendships ended in silence when he ceased to have editorial influence. He confessed that, though proudly gay, he had avoided sex since childhood abuse. As a true dandy, like those in favourite novels by Balzac and Baudelaire, his real romance had always been with the clothes.

1/21/2022,"A leading Unilever shareholder has called the company’s failed £50bn offer for GSK’s consumer healthcare division a “near-death experience” and said management should focus on improving its core business – or step down. Terry Smith, the founder of Fundsmith, lambasted Unilever in a “postmortem” letter to investors in his £29bn asset management business.  The letter comes a day after Unilever said it would not increase its bid for a fourth time, leaving GSK free to float its consumer arm as planned this summer. “[This is] about a near death experience as it now appears that Unilever’s attempt to purchase the GSK consumer business is now thankfully dead rather than the value of our investment in Unilever,” said the letter, which was co-written by Fundsmith’s head of research, Julian Robins. Fundsmith is the seventh largest active shareholder in Unilever, the owner of numerous household brands, including Marmite and Dove soap. In a wide-ranging critique of Unilever and its management, Smith and Robins attacked the company’s long-term performance, accused it of not engaging with shareholders, having a flawed mergers and acquisitions strategy, as well as a “penchant for corporate gobbledegook”. “Unilever’s performance has been poor,” the letter said. “It is the worst performer by a considerable margin amongst the multinational FMCG [fast-moving consumer goods] companies we have owned and not just in terms of share price but also in terms of sales growth.” The credit rating agency Fitch on Tuesday said a debt-fuelled purchase of GSK consumer healthcare division could trigger a “multi-notch downgrade” of Unilever’s rating, which could make it more expensive for the company to borrow and force some investors to dump the shares. Unilever’s share price has lagged rivals in recent years and are down 30% since 2019, when Alan Jope took over as chief executive. Its market value has fallen by a fifth during the last 12 months, even as the FTSE 100 has gained 13%. “It seems to us that Unilever management’s response to its poor performance has been to utter meaningless platitudes to which it has now attempted to add major M&A activity,” the letter said. “What could possibly go wrong.” Last week, Smith, whose fund holds a position worth more than £800m in Unilever, used his annual letter to clients to attack the Jope’s strategy of boosting the environmental, social and governance credentials of the company rather than focusing on core business performance. Smith said on Thursday: “We believe Unilever management – or someone else if they don’t want the job – should surely focus on getting the operating performance of the existing business to the level it should before taking on anymore challenges.” Fundsmith said Unilever investors should just wait to buy a piece of GSK Consumer Healthcare when it floats, rather than own the business outright by paying a higher price through a takeover.",News/Business,Top investor castigates Unilever after failed £50bn bid for GSK arm,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/20/top-investor-castigates-unilever-after-failed-pounds-50bn-bid-for-gsk-arm-terry-smith
1/21/2022,"A different referee, less out of puff, might have sent off Steven Bergwijn for shoving Caglar Soyuncu in the chest after play-acting for a penalty towards the end of the match between Leicester and Spurs on Wednesday night. But thankfully – although Foxes fans are permitted to demur – Jon Moss, blowing hard after 93 minutes of non-stop action, had little appetite or energy for digging deep into his pocket for the red card, and merely brandished yellow instead. Cue the most preposterous stoppage-time turnaround since Mario Balotelli teed one up for Agüeroooooooo. If only Martin Tyler had been commentating.  Bergwijn, off the hook, went on to score a 95th-minute equaliser, then 80 seconds later – which is not a lot of time when you factor in relieved celebrations and other associated fannying around before the restart – rounded Kasper Schmeichel, who had already started moaning at possession-shedder Youri Tielemans, and slotted home the winner. A comeback that was nothing short of heroic, although Leicester’s collapse was, how shall we say, a little Spursy. Mind you, there was plenty of BrenDNA in there too, when you consider Liverpool’s 2014 title challenge, Leicester’s attempts to qualify for Big Cup, and everything the Queen’s Celtic achieved under the master toast-and-tea-fuelled tactician in Europe. It’s almost as if a pattern is emerging. So with the concept of Spursiness having finally been consigned to history, surely to be replaced in the vernacular by Rodgersesque, it was an almost perfect night for Antonio Conte. He maintained his unbeaten Premier League record as Spurs boss, saw his team leapfrog arch-rivals Arsenal in the table, and despite some understandably wild touchline celebrations, his new lid – a centre parting with subtle quiff that replaces that trademark Beatles ’63 fringe – stayed resolutely in place.

1/21/2022,"The far-right activist Tommy Robinson is being pursued for an estimated £2m by creditors after he claimed bankruptcy during a high court libel trial. The English Defence League founder, whose real name is Stephen Christopher Yaxley-Lennon, declared himself bankrupt in a high court trial last year in which he was ordered to pay £100,000 in libel damages to a Syrian schoolboy he defamed online.  In March Robinson will be officially discharged from bankruptcy, meaning he no longer has to pay back any debts covered by the filing – including the six-figure legal fees. It emerged on Thursday that creditors have asked an independent insolvency expert to investigate whether Robinson’s claim is genuine or whether he is “hiding” assets to avoid paying his debts. The campaign group Hope Not Hate said it believed Robinson had access to assets worth up to about £3m through property acquisitions, investments, donations and book sales. The group said it would supply a dossier of evidence to the new investigation. The Guardian has attempted to reach Robinson for comment. Nick Lowles, the chief executive of Hope Not Hate, said: “It is wholly unjust that while his victim’s life has been turned upside down, Tommy Robinson carries on his life as before.” Robinson claimed bankruptcy in March last year during a high court libel trial brought by Jamal Hijazi, a schoolboy from Syria who was filmed being attacked at school. Shortly after the video of the incident went viral, Robinson falsely claimed in Facebook videos viewed by nearly 1 million people that Hijazi was “not innocent and he violently attacks young English girls in his school”. The judge, Mr Justice Nicklin, said the consequences of Robinson’s falsehoods had been “particularly severe” for Hijazi and the scars would “likely last for many years, if not a lifetime”. He ordered Robinson to pay Hijazi £100,000 in damages plus his legal costs, although the teenager has not yet seen a penny due to Robinson’s bankruptcy claim. Hope Not Hate said it was raising funds in order to compile a dossier for investigators about Robinson’s finances. Lowles said: “Tommy Robinson has to understand that there are real consequences to his hate. It is time to make him pay up and ensure that his victims get proper justice.” The insolvency investigator has a number of powers at his disposal including accessing Robinson’s bank and company records, interviewing witnesses under oath and – if necessary – applying to court for search and arrest warrants. The Guardian has revealed previously how Robinson had an international network of wealthy backers and received donations and other support from across the globe. Such was the influence of Robinson’s supporters that they asked advisers to the Republican former US presidential candidate Ted Cruz for legal advice on securing an extended visa for “someone who needs protection”.",News/UK news,Tommy Robinson pursued for estimated £2m debt after bankruptcy claim,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/20/tommy-robinson-pursued-for-estimated-2m-debt-after-bankruptcy-claim
1/21/2022,"There is a lot of romance in the idea of Wayne Rooney returning to Everton to become manager – and I am in love with the thought – but it makes a lot of business sense, too. After Rafael Benítez’s brief and, ultimately, unhappy spell, the club need to reconnect with the fans and the appointment of a hero is a good way of going about it. It is fair to say a lot of the fanbase were not enamoured of the appointment of a former Liverpool manager, so going in the opposite direction would be a smart move to get the supporters back on side.  For me the dream would be Duncan Ferguson as assistant alongside Rooney. When Rooney came through at Everton, Ferguson was the one who looked after him; he would drive him to training and act as a protector on the pitch, although also don the boxing gloves because they would spar together in the club’s gym. Rooney idolised Ferguson growing up and they became good friends during their playing days, a bond that could help get Everton back to their best. Ferguson knows how to get the best out of Rooney – he knew his teammate was at his best on the pitch when angry, so would get him fired up before matches. Having an assistant who knows how a manager ticks is integral and this seems a perfect match. Although Rooney does not have a vast array of experience as a manager, he has shown some very promising signs at Derby. Despite all the struggles going on around the club, the performances and results have been impressive with a relatively young squad which he has galvanised in tough circumstances. Rooney has held his own in a storm, a good sign that he can deal with anything. There are never guarantees that a great player will become a good manager. Rooney, however, will have picked up plenty down the years playing for some of the most accomplished coaches in the game. He learned a lot from Sir Alex Ferguson and speaks glowingly about the man-management he and his Manchester United teammates received and he will be looking to implement a similar style. Top players are always targets to be hunted but Rooney knew how to avoid the traps and stay at the highest level for a long time. He knows what it takes to win and is accustomed to diverse dressing rooms with big characters such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlos Tevez and Nemanja Vidic, so he knows how to cope with the elite. Those within the Everton dressing room will not want a constant churn of managers; what players desire is consistency to ensure high performance. Bringing in Rooney, who immediately has the respect of a squad because of his achievements, would be a great boost to this group. When someone of his ilk speaks, everyone listens. When you have had such a successful and diverse career it is a great help. I would often ask Rachel Yankey a question and she would say, ‘I might not know the answer but I can only speak from my experience’, and she has had so much experience that you ended up getting the answer you needed every time. Any player going to Rooney will be able to get the answer in the same way because he has done so much in the game and it will have happened to him or someone around him in a dressing room, so he can give the best guidance. He knows how to manage a young squad and Everton have plenty of young talent emerging. To learn off a former Goodison Park prodigy would be perfect for them because he realises everything the players are going through as they try to become Premier League regulars. Amid all the hype and narrative there are concerns for Rooney regarding a potential homecoming. There will be fears from some corners that, like Frank Lampard at Chelsea, the dream job has come too soon and if it goes wrong then it’s a long way back. Lampard’s situation, however, was very different to what Rooney would find at Goodison Park. He had the transfer ban but had such a good squad and young players he was fully aware of from his assistant Jody Morris’s work in the academy and there was a bit more pressure on him. Rooney would be coming into a side in a really difficult situation and have greater time to grow and less of a fall if things go badly. Despite Everton’s issues there are plenty of positives within the squad. The players are struggling for confidence but Rooney has proved at Derby he can enthuse players. He has a striker in Dominic Calvert-Lewin who will score goals with the right assistance, they have decent wide players and a good goalkeeper in Jordan Pickford, and youngsters such as Jarrad Branthwaite are starting to emerge. Rooney would do well to bring in someone to help with recruitment, which is where Everton have fallen short in recent times.
