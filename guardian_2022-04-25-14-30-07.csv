But beneath all that, he is constantly fretting over his single status, lack of career progression and being left behind in his friendship group. The opening episode sees Andy’s trip after taking hallucinogens. Hollie Richardson Hannah and Christie spend the episode prancing around London hand in hand like Sandy and Danny in the opening titles of Grease. Meanwhile, Zander discovers that Tyler has been up to no good, but Nina is oblivious to her lover’s misdeeds. HR Vladimir Putin hates him so much, he refuses to say his name. But still, somehow, Alexei Navalny remains both alive (albeit imprisoned) and fiercely critical of the Russian president.

4/25/2022,"Known as “the tuber man of Kerala”, Shaji NM has travelled throughout India over the past two decades, sometimes inspecting bushes in tribal villages, at other times studying the ground of forests closer to home among the green hills of Wayanad in Kerala. His one purpose, and what earned him his title, is to collect rare indigenous varieties of tuber crops. “People call me crazy, but it’s for the love of tubers that I do what I do,” says Shaji. “I have developed an emotional relationship with the tuber. When we did not have anything to eat, we had tubers.” Shaji’s 8,000 sq metre (2 acre) farm boasts a wide array of tubers, some on the verge of extinction and some that produce record-sized fruits. Better-known varieties such as yams, sweet potato, cassava, taro and Chinese potato also thrive there. Like many Keralites, Shaji’s personal favourite is the dioscorea – he grows about 60 varieties on his farm – and he particularly loves white yams. At times, word of mouth helps him locate rare tubers, with Facebook and WhatsApp groups also updating him on potential discoveries. When he finds a new variety, he says: “I consult the elders and farmers of the various tribal villages, and we try to name the tuber something closest to the tribal name.” As well as earning him his nickname, Shaji’s work in conserving and popularising the tuber has been recognised with a number of awards at state and national level, including an India biodiversity award for the conservation of domesticated species in 2021. His love of tubers, which are used extensively in Indian cooking, began at a young age. While he was growing up, food was often scarce. “Staples like wheat or rice were hard to get,” says Shaji. “And the only thing that provided us with a constant supply of food was tubers, because they are locally available and grow easily.” When Shaji’s grandparents moved from the low-lying area of Ernakulam in Kerala to the highlands of Wayanad in 1952, feasting on traditionally grown tubers was a way of life which Shaji continued. Shaji thinks tubers are not only essential as a food but also for their medicinal properties. “We used to eat food as our medicine – now we eat medicine as our food,” he says. “It must be the tubers that have kept my grandparents healthy even now at the age of 110.” Today, Shaji’s prized collection consists of more than 200 varieties of wild and indigenous tuber crops. The day we spoke, he had just finished giving a tour of his farm to 50 students from Bengaluru. To him, knowledge should be easily accessible. “I grow these crops on my land and then give the seeds to farmers and to anyone who wants them. In return, I encourage them to multiply the crops and to include them in their diet,” says Shaji, who calls himself a “cultivator” rather than a farmer. But conserving some of the rarer tubers is not so easy as the climate heats up. Kerala is losing biodiversity as incessant and unseasonal rains wash away fertile fields. When, in 2018, Kerala received one of the heaviest recorded rainfalls in its history, Shaji’s farm was under water for 15 days. “The scientists told me that everything would be rotten, and I believed them. I thought it’s OK to lose everything and start from the beginning as I did once,” he says. But to his – and the village’s – surprise, “everything started to sprout back after a month or so,” says Shaji. “I have never used any chemical on my soil, ever. Maybe it’s because my soil is so good that nature does not devastate my farm.” Researchers noted in a paper in 2018 that tuber crops “are resilient to climate change due to their capacity to surge over the adverse conditions by becoming dormant and resuming tuber growth during favourable conditions, thereby bringing down the chances of crop failures”. This ability to tolerate changing climate conditions, say the researchers, makes the tuber “very important for the food security and income of people in this region as well as in many parts of the country”. For Shaji though, farming is much more than just providing food. “Agriculture should start first in our hearts and not in the earth,” he says. “And then we know how to take care of it just by looking at it.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,‘The tuber man of Kerala’ on a quest to champion India’s rare and indigenous crops,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/25/tuber-man-of-kerala-climate-change-key-indian-food-security-aoe
4/25/2022,"As the news cycle regularly demonstrates, the simple, quintessentially modern act of taking a photograph has now become a predominant way of subverting entrenched power. And female artists, often on the fringes of cultural society, have been using their cameras to do just that for well over 100 years. This is one of the provocative declarations made by Our Selves: Photographs by Women Artists from Helen Kornblum, the Museum of Modern Art’s empowering new exhibit of work by female photographers from over 100 years and all around the globe. “For me it was interesting to constantly ask the question what is a feminist picture, because I got so many answers,” exhibit curator Roxana Marcoci told the Guardian. In fact, Our Selves provides 90 answers to this question, ranging from Frances Benjamin Johnston’s 1899 photograph of young students in a penmanship class to Black photographer Carrie Mae Weem’s 1990s “kitchen table” series. Feminist pictures also look like queer photographer Catherine Opie’s work Angela Scheirl, which depicts the transgender artist Hans Scheirl years before he transitioned to male, and Native American Cara Romero’s Wakeah, a 2018 portrayal of her friend Wakeah Jhane in full tribal dress. Yet even as Our Selves can proudly declare that feminism supports a wide-ranging, inclusive idea of womanhood, Marcoci is mindful that this has not always been the case. “As women have fought for sovereignty, they have not always included all women,” she said. Indeed, this is one of the central questions that this show seeks to grapple with. “When I was conceiving of the exhibit, I was thinking about, Ain’t I a Woman?, bell hooks’ blistering critique of first and second wave feminism for sidelining women of color. So this was all underlying the exhibition as it was coming together.” Our Selves emerged from a deep-rooted collaboration between Marcoci and psychotherapist Helen Kornblum. For over 40 years, Kornblum meticulously built a collection of photographs made by female artists, and a gift to the MoMA of many of these photographs comprises the core of Our Selves. This gift was the fruit of a longtime professional relationship between Marcoci and Kornblum: since 2014, they have served together on the MoMA’s Committee on Photography, developing the museum’s representation of female artists and pushing the museum to rethink dominant narratives handed down by the patriarchal power structure. For Marcoci, this connection has been transformative. “When [Kornblum] joined the Committee on Photography, we instantly bonded on our work on women artists and women’s rights. When I saw her photography collection for myself, I loved the vision that she had brought to it. It connected with my own interests and the MoMA’s mission, to show arts that reflect a diversity of race and gender.” Our Selves stretches back to the late 19th century, and it pays due respect to the modernist movement that underlies so many of the latter day artists it shows. The art here includes modernist greats like Claude Cahun, Tina Modetti, and Lotte Jacobi, and it name-checks the likes of Leonora Carrington and Frida Kahlo. To these standard-bearers, Our Selves also adds lesser-known artists like Gertrud Arndt and Alma Levenson a collaborator of Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham, and Edward Weston. While these images are powerful in their own right, they also act as a foundation, helping to situate and ground the more contemporary works on display throughout the show. The theme of self-presentation is strongly prevalent throughout Our Selves, with so many of the pieces on display here having been developed from intimate relationships between photographer and subject. For instance, while looking at Romero’s Wakeah – an image of a Native American woman covered head-to-toe in layers and layers of clothing – the subject offers a sense of vulnerability and display in spite of her voluminous dress. Romero’s subject, a good friend, trusts the photographer to not do as so many other photographers have done before when confronted with Native American dress and culture. Although her gaze is proud and strong, it lacks the wariness that comes with powerlessness and appropriation, instead subtly beckoning the viewer closer. The gaze in Wakeah meets up in interesting ways with the gazes in the photographs by the American war photographer Susan Meiselas, demonstrating the exhibition’s fascinating coherence, the photographs continually playing off one another. In Meiselas’s aptly named Tentful of Marks, the camera is poised behind the two lithe, heeled legs of a carnival stripper, while one of the titular marks gazes up in awe at her, behind him so many similarly fixated, zombified male faces. Those faces take on added meaning when seen in conjunction with Meiselas’s other contributions to the show: Traditional Mask Used in the Popular Insurrection, Monimbo, Nicaragua. That image shows an individual, presumably male, whose entire face and gaze is effaced by a mask of a mustachioed man that stares straight into the camera, the subject’s humanity only defined by one hand resting furtively on a barbed wire fence. While Wakeah shows what is possible when power relationships are momentarily left aside, Meiselas’s photographs are about deconstructions of power relationships in full bloom. Together, all three raise questions about gender, bodies, and who has the right to gaze at whom. Carrie Mae Weems’s photograph Woman and Daughter with Makeup captures another moment of profound gazing, when these power relationships are seemingly at bay, yet are also quietly operative. The picture simply depicts a Black woman and her daughter simultaneously applying lipstick; the two exist at once together and separately, as they eerily synchronize their movements yet do so while focusing intensely on their own mirror reflection, seemingly each in their own world. Marcoci told me that this photo stood out to her for the way that Weems “places Black women at the forefront of the consequences of power. It’s such a moment of enacting beauty, synchronized performance, and yet nothing is fetishized in this picture. It’s an image of care, Black beauty, Black interiority … there’s so much grace in how it’s expressed.” Our Selves is worthy of applause for the respect it pays to women of various intersectional identities – not only does it celebrate artists like Weems and Romero, it also offers Catherine Opie’s transformational photographs of queer life, and the show acknowledges its debts to postcolonial and queer theorists. However, all of this does make it disappointing that the show contains no works by or of transgender women. Particularly at a time when many identifying as “feminists” are attempting to deprive transgender women of their safety, dignity, and basic rights – recalling the way that prior waves of feminism sought to exclude non-white, non-heterosexual women – it would seem logical that an exhibition that prides itself on its inclusiveness and its dedication to all women’s rights would want to make its voice clear on this subject. It is the one false note in an otherwise glorious celebration of women and photography. Much as Our Selves does to push forward important conversations and ideas for the future of feminism, Marcoci is mindful that it is a part of a much larger struggle. “It’s important to keep in mind that the work is never done,” she said. “I know that I will continue drawing attention to women artists and issues for the rest of my professional life. It’s work of unlearning the histories that have been taught to us in school and envisioning different narratives, like learning a new language basically.” Our Selves: Photographs by Women Artists from Helen Kornblum is now on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York until 2 October",Arts/Art and design,Our Selves: celebrating photographs taken by female artists,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/24/our-selves-celebrating-photographs-taken-by-female-artists
4/25/2022,"A blue plaque is to be unveiled in Leeds commemorating David Oluwale, a British-Nigerian man who died in 1969 after being harassed by police. The plaque will be on Leeds Bridge, close to where Oluwale was last seen alive, being chased by Sgt Kenneth Kitching and Insp Geoffrey Ellerker. His body was found two weeks later about a mile away in the River Aire, which flows under the bridge. In a landmark case in 1971, the two officers, who had subjected Oluwale to a long campaign of abuse were convicted of assault by a jury, having been directed to acquit them of manslaughter. It was the first successful prosecution of British police officers for involvement in the death of a black person, according to Leeds Civic Trust. Several nominations were submitted over the years for a blue plaque to commemorate Oluwale, but in 2019 it was rejected by the trust in part because it was not celebratory and his legacy was posthumous. However, the criteria for plaques was changed after an independent review in 2021 commissioned following the murder of George Floyd and subsequent anti-racist protests. Max Farrar, the secretary of the Remember Oluwale charity, said: “After many years of quiet campaigning by #RememberOluwale, the Black Lives Matter protests put wind in our sails, and this blue plaque for David Oluwale is one of several signs that Leeds is committed to being more welcoming, more inclusive and more equal. “Leeds Civic Trust is one of our many partners who recognise that Leeds has to face up to its shameful history of racism and take active steps to transform itself. We are extremely grateful to all our supporters.” Remember Oluwale launched a successful crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the plaque. Among those speaking at Monday’s unveiling will be the author Caryl Phillips, who wrote an essay on Oluwale in his 2007 book Foreigners – Three English Lives (2007), the city council leader, James Lewis, and Det Ch Supt Carl Galvin. Galvin’s father, Gary Galvin, a police cadet, acted as a whistleblower, exposing that Oluwale had been the victim of serious and sustained mistreatment by officers. The David Oluwale Choir will sing songs composed by Leeds United football fans after the imprisonment of Ellerker and Kitching. One of the chants they would sing on the terraces, to the tune of Michael Rowed the Boat Ashore, was “The River Aire is chilly and deep, Ol-u-wale; Never trust the Leeds police, Ol-u-wale.” The trust’s director, Martin Hamilton, said: “A blue plaque scheme should be more than a pat on the back for famous, high-achieving people. It should also tell the story of significant points in history that risk being forgotten or overlooked.” “David Oluwale did not have the opportunity to achieve his potential in his own lifetime, but the legacy created after his death is one that deserves to be highlighted.” Last month, a footbridge named after Oluwale was installed over the River Aire and a sculpture commemorating him is being created by the British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare for the new Meadow Lane gardens nearby.",News/UK news,"David Oluwale, victim of police harassment, to be remembered by blue plaque in Leeds",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/25/david-oluwale-victim-of-police-harassment-to-be-remembered-by-blue-plaque-in-leeds
4/25/2022,"The Labour party has vowed to abolish the “non-dom” tax loophole used by the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s wife to save paying up to £20m in UK tax. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said it “simply isn’t right that those at the top can benefit from outdated non-dom tax perks” while ordinary people struggle with tax rises and the cost of living crisis. Reeves on Monday said Labour was sending “a clear message” to the global super-rich: “If you make your home in Britain you should pay tax here – on all of your income.” Labour’s pledge follows the revelation that Sunak’s billionaire heiress wife, Akshata Murty, had been registered as a non-domiciled person for nine years and was paying an annual levy in order to shelter her foreign income from HMRC. The status meant she could legally avoid UK tax on annual dividends worth millions, which she collected from her family’s IT business empire. Following days of mounting public and political outrage, Murty announced this month she would begin paying tax on her worldwide income. However, she will not do so on backdated income. She also refused to give up her non-dom status, which could in future allow her family a legal means of avoiding an inheritance tax bill of more than £275m. It also emerged that Sajid Javid, the health secretary, held non-dom status for six years while a banker, also allowing him to avoid tax on overseas earnings without breaking the law. “With Labour, people who make the UK their home will contribute to this country by paying tax on their global income,” Reeves said. “The prime minister and chancellor have spent the last few weeks preoccupied with saving their own skins, and have done nothing to tackle the spiralling cost of living. Even worse, they’ve made it harder for working people to make ends meet by hiking national insurance.” Reeves promised that a Labour government would “tax fairly, spend wisely, and grow the economy”. Proponents of non-dom status have warned that scrapping it could deter business owners from investing in the UK and creating jobs. Reeves said Labour would replace the non-dom status – which was introduced under King George III in 1799 when Britain was fighting France – with a modern scheme for people who are “genuinely living in the UK for short periods to allow us to continue to attract top international talent”. Labour said it would consult widely on how its new “temporary resident tax regime” would work but that any tax advantages would be likely to expire after five years, compared with up to 15 years under the current system. The party said its plan would finally “put an end to the broken 200-year-old system that lets people dodge millions in tax, and bring our rules into line with those of systems similar to other major economies such as France, Germany and Canada”. Scrapping the non-dom scheme could lead to a £1bn boost to the exchequer, Labour claimed citing research by the EU Tax Observatory. The number of people who have ever claimed non-dom status in the UK rose from 162,000 in 2001 to 238,000 in 2018, according to a study by the London School of Economics and the University of Warwick. This is not the first time Labour has promised tackle the controversial tax loophole, including while in government. When Gordon Brown was chancellor, he used his 2002 budget to announce a review of non-dom rules following public outrage at the revelation that Hans Rausing, then the UK’s richest person, claimed non-dom status. Brown declared that the country “must act swiftly to close tax loopholes and be vigilant against tax avoidance”. However, it took a year to produce a “discussion document” that ruminated on possible changes but no action was taken. Critics suggest that the very rich non-doms and their well-paid advisers lobbied hard for the tax scheme to be left in place, claiming that if scrapped the global super-rich would leave the UK and take their money with them. During the period that potential changes were under discussion, steel billionaire Lakshmi Mittal – a non-dom – became the Labour party’s biggest donor. Mittal, who owns a £90m mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens next door to fellow non-dom Roman Abramovich, donated £125,000 in 2001 (before the review) but increased his donation to £2m in 2005 and gave a further £2m in 2007. In 2015, then Labour leader Ed Miliband also promised to axe the “indefensible” non-dom tax scheme. A spokesperson for Gordon Brown declined to comment.",News/News,Rachel Reeves promises Labour will close ‘non-dom’ tax loophole,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/apr/25/rachel-reeves-promises-labour-will-close-non-dom-tax-loophole
4/25/2022,"Britain’s hopes of a favourable post-Brexit trade deal with the US risk being undermined by the government’s lack of engagement on workers’ rights, trade unions have warned. As a second round of US-UK talks begins this week, union leaders from both countries said Washington would push for a “worker-centred approach to trade” to help unlock a deal. Accusing Boris Johnson’s government of failing to grasp the importance of labour rights, the TUC and the AFL-CIO, the biggest union federations in the UK and the US, said a change of tack was urgently required. It comes as ministers push to build new ties around the world after leaving the EU, with a US trade deal considered a prize target for the government as it attempts to demonstrate benefits of Brexit. After opening a dialogue on the future of Atlantic trade last month in Baltimore, talks resume this week in Aberdeen and London between the UK trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan and Katherine Tai, the US trade representative. At the first round of meetings Trevelyan pledged she would “strengthen the protection of labour rights and the environment” and “tackle forced labour globally”. However, the US and UK union leaders said the British government had too often hurtled into deals with unsavoury regimes that had no respect for fundamental human and labour rights. The government had promised a role for union representatives in powerful post-Brexit trade advisory groups, which are consulted on negotiations. However, the TUC warned its nominees for the posts had not yet been confirmed by ministers, meaning unions did not have a place at the table. In a joint statement, the two groups representing more than 17 million workers, called on the US and UK governments to work together to protect employment standards. Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said the UK government had rushed into post-Brexit negotiations with countries that “readily abuse fundamental human and labour rights” such as Colombia and Turkey. “Trade deals can lift labour standards, promote decent work and reduce inequality around the world. But the UK government has agreed too many deals that leave working people worse off,” she said. “Enough is enough. It’s time for a truly worker-centred trade approach. That means meaningfully consulting with trade unions and acting on our concerns. Only then is the US government likely to consider closer trade ties with the UK.” Eric Gottwald, a trade policy specialist at the AFL-CIO, said: “For too long, the voices of working people have been shut out of trade negotiations or discussions. We need the TUC and its unions at the table to shape a fair agreement that lifts wages and standards on both sides of the Atlantic.” The groups said that under Joe Biden’s administration, the US had increasingly involved protections for workers’ rights in trade negotiations in recent years, including in the latest US-Mexico-Canada agreement. The leaders said as a result of trade union involvement in the USMCA negotiation, the agreement contains “one of the strongest labour rights enforcement chapters ever agreed”, with possibilities for sanctions to be introduced against companies that are abusing workers’ rights”. A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: “Trade unions attended the first UK-US trade dialogue in Baltimore last month, and tomorrow the TUC general secretary is speaking in the plenary session of the second dialogue which we’re hosting in Aberdeen. “The UK has a strong trading relationship with the US, worth over £200bn per year, and through our joint trade dialogues we can deliver a broader and even more ambitious trade agenda. “We are committed to listening to trade unions and a wide range of voices to ensure our trade policy delivers for the whole of the UK.”",News/Business,Britain’s hopes of post-Brexit US trade deal ‘depend on workers’ rights’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/25/britains-hopes-of-post-brexit-us-trade-deal-depend-on-workers-rights
4/25/2022,"Pharmacy staff in England are facing growing abuse and aggression from patients frustrated that drug shortages mean they cannot get their usual medications, a survey reveals. The hostility, including swearing and spitting, comes as availability of medicines is becoming more uncertain as a result of Brexit, the Covid pandemic and ingredient supply problems. Hormone replacement therapy drugs are in short supply in many places, affecting women undergoing menopause, for example. Half of pharmacists and counter staff say the unpredictability is causing problems for customers managing their health, according to research by the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee (PSNC), which represents community pharmacies in England. Two-thirds of pharmacies say they are dealing with shortages every day and another 21% encounter them several times a week. The PSNC’s survey of 1,132 staff from and 418 bosses of 5,000 pharmacies found: 75% of pharmacies have seen patients turn aggressive when told they cannot have the medication they have been prescribed. 49% of staff say patient abuse is undermining their mental wellbeing. 51% believe supply chain issues affect patients every day. “It is really worrying to hear that pharmacy staff are so routinely facing aggression from patients,” said Janet Morrison, the PSNC’s chief executive. “Pharmacists tell us anecdotally that this can include verbal abuse, swearing, spitting and threatening to report staff to regulators. “Many community pharmacies are having to deal with medicine supply issues on a daily basis. This adds pressures on to already busy pharmacy teams and can also be worrying for patients if they have to wait longer for the medicines that they need.” Patients were left “frustrated and inconvenienced” by drug shortages, she added. Supply problems can lead to pharmacists giving patients only part of the medication they are due and having to ask them to come back for the rest later, or asking GPs to prescribe the patient a different drug, or ringing other suppliers to see if they have stocks available. The shortages are adding to the pressure on pharmacies, which have played a key part in the rollout of Covid vaccines but are now being affected by staff sickness and growing staff shortages. Lack of staff is such a challenge that pharmacies are increasingly having to close temporarily, usually for a few hours at a time, the PSNC found. That in turn puts extra strain on nearby GP surgeries and NHS walk-in centres from patients who cannot get medical treatment at the pharmacy. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “There is zero tolerance of violence or abuse directed at healthcare staff who have devoted so much to protect patients during the pandemic and deserve to work in a safe and secure environment free from assault or harassment. “The department has well established procedures to deal with medicine shortages and works closely with the pharmaceutical industry and the NHS to minimise disruption on the few occasions they arise.”",News/Society,Pharmacists in England face abuse from patients due to drug shortages,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/25/pharmacists-in-england-face-abuse-from-patients-due-to-drug-shortages

The domed hills south of Aberaeron were rendered in warm hues by the last of the sunset, the light breaking below the layered cloud casting long shadows of trees and hedgerows across the fields. But turning eastwards at Synod Inn reminded me that this was no casual evening jaunt, as my son drove me into the gathering dusk to a hospital a hundred miles distant – the unexpected result of a sudden phone call from a concerned consultant. A couple of weeks later I am back on my home turf, chastened and facing some new and uncomfortable realities – but with renewed respect for the good folk of the NHS, who may just have saved my life for the third time. In my absence, spring has continued unabated, with the lambs noticeably larger and stockier than when I left. At the margins of the lane, the celandines have almost been displaced by the large, sturdy flowers of the dandelion – some of which have already set seed and begun their familiar, if not always welcome, aerial dispersion. Through the open back door, the song of the nearest robin is clear and incisive, carrying over the lower – more measured – tones of various resident blackbirds. Just where two hedgerows collide in a blur of tangled growth, one pair of blackbirds claims a nest site established over several seasons. Already, the male bird has been seen carrying beakfuls of worms into this spot, making his defensive feelings clear to any who wander too close. We await developments. Further up the lane, small clumps of primrose and violet bring vivid points of colour to the banks, where the grass is beginning to overtake the winter ground cover of ivy leaves. In the still air, the sound of water trickling from field drains seems overly loud as it merges with the calmer surface of the stream. Emerging from the canopy of trees, I pause by the gate that leads to the top field. For the first time this year, the metal is warm to the touch – and, suddenly weary, I lean my body against the gate and feel the welcome heat of the spring sunshine on my back.
