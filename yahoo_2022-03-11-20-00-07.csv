3/11/2022,"If you receive an unsolicited text message along with a photo of an unknown young woman, don’t answer it, experts warn. In the latest text messaging scam, people throughout the United States have been receiving a text — likely from a number with the same area code as their own — from a rather friendly woman. “it’s been a little bit since u called, do u want me yet?” one text reads. Others have received texts with similar phrasing. “What’s up handsome! I had so much enjoyment the other night. What do you feel ab round 2?” another reads. Many of the texts include a selfie of a red-haired woman, likely in her 20s or 30s ⁠— except that’s not who is actually sending the text. “I did a double-take,” Pam Anson, the director of brand outreach for the Better Business Bureau serving Greater Cleveland, told WOIO. “It’s a different approach than most scammers take and I didn’t think anything too seriously until more of my friends started to say that they also received it.” One theory that has circulated on social media is that the scam is related to sex trafficking. One viral post says that by responding, the person on the receiving end “can track your location.” But that’s not accurate, says Ron Pierce, president of IT company Trinity Solutions. “It’s a spam text message,” Pierce told WFMY. “It’s kind of one of those social myths, it gets circulated every now and then. This one has been going around since at least 2020, and maybe even a little before. Then it used to be just the whole sex trafficking angle, but now it’s, ‘watch out, they could track you.’ It’s a lie, they can’t track you by responding to the text or clicking anything like that.” That’s not to say answering the wrong-number text isn’t without some risks, however. By responding, you confirm to the scammer that your phone number is legitimate and they are able to get additional numbers, says Robyn Householder, CEO of BBB Middle Tennessee. “Once they have access to your phone, then they have access to your contact list,” she told WSMV. “One victim makes it a good day for them.” It also may be a part of a romance scam, which have been on the rise. The Federal Trade Commission says people have lost more than $1.3 billion to romance scams in the past five years — including $547 million last year. The scammers are deceitful and may try to con you out of your personal information or money, said Angie Barnett, president and CEO of the Better Business Bureau serving Greater Maryland. “They’re charming, they say the right thing, they make you feel important,” Barnett told WMAR. “They give you what you need.’ All of the experts agree on one thing — don’t respond. Screenshot the text and reach out to your local law enforcement, they suggest.

3/11/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin gave the green light on Friday for up to 16,000 volunteers from the Middle East to be deployed alongside Russian-backed rebels to fight in Ukraine, doubling down an invasion that the West says has been losing momentum. The move, just over two weeks since Putin ordered the invasion, allows Russia to deploy battle-hardened mercenaries from conflicts such as Syria without risking additional Russian military casualties. At a meeting of Russia's Security Council, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said there were 16,000 volunteers in the Middle East who were ready to come to fight alongside Russian-backed forces in the breakaway Donbass region of eastern Ukraine. ""If you see that there are these people who want of their own accord, not for money, to come to help the people living in Donbass, then we need to give them what they want and help them get to the conflict zone,"" Putin said from the Kremlin. Shoigu also proposed that Western-made Javelin and Stinger missiles that were captured by the Russian army in Ukraine should be handed over to Donbass forces, along other weaponry such as man-portable air-defense systems, known as MANPADS, and anti-tank rocket complexes. ""As to the delivery of arms, especially Western-made ones which have fallen into the hands of the Russian army - of course I support the possibility of giving these to the military units of the Lugansk and Donetsk people's republics,"" Putin said. ""Please do this,"" he told Shoigu. The exchange was shown on Russian state television. Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is essential to ensure Russia's security after the United States expanded NATO up to its borders and supported pro-Western leaders in Kyiv. Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence while the United States, and its European and Asian allies have condemned the Russian invasion. China has called for calm. Shoigu said the operation was all going to plan before requesting Putin's approal for the use of fighters from the Middle East. U.S. intelligence chiefs told lawmakers on Thursday that Russia had been surprised by the strength of Ukrainian resistance, which had deprived the Kremlin of a quick victory it thought would have prevented the United States and NATO from providing meaningful military aid. That was causing concern in Beijing, Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns said. ""I do believe that the Chinese leadership, President Xi (Jinping) in particular, is unsettled,"" Burns said. ""By what he's seen, partly because his own intelligence doesn't appear to have told him what was going to happen."" Shoigu said Western arms were flowing into Ukraine in an ""absolutely uncontrolled"" way and that the Russian military planned to strengthen its Western border after what he said was a build up of Western military units on Russia's border. ""The general staff is working on, and has almost finished, a plan to strengthen our Western borders, including, naturally, with new modern complexes,"" Shoigu said. Putin said the question of how to react to moves by NATO countries need a separate discussion.

3/11/2022,"PIERRE, S.D. (AP) — South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem's cabinet secretary who oversaw an investigation into the state's attorney general for a 2020 fatal car crash on Wednesday urged House lawmakers to bring impeachment charges against him, alleging in a letter that the attorney general was distracted, was untruthful during the investigation and previously traded “disparaging and offensive” text messages with his staff about other state officials. Secretary of Public Safety Craig Price released the letter sent to House lawmakers Wednesday, stating that the investigation led him to conclude Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg is “unfit to hold the position as the chief law enforcement officer"" of the state. Price alleged that an examination of Ravnsborg's phone had turned up text messages between the Republican attorney general and his top aides that made “disparaging and offensive statements” about law enforcement officers, a U.S. senator, a supreme court justice and other state officials. Price's letter did not divulge details about the messages besides one — sent to Ravnsborg from a political consultant — that stated, “Well, at least the guy was a Democrat” two days after the crash. No context around that text message was given. A spokesman for Ravnsborg did not immediately respond to a request for comment. House Speaker Spencer Gosch, a Republican who is overseeing the House's impeachment investigation into Ravnsborg's conduct, called the pressure from Noem's office an attempt to “interfere” in an investigation that belonged to the House. “It's disgusting and it's just a poor way to allow the process to run out,” Gosch said, adding that Noem's move was “very calculated.” As a House committee has dug into the crash investigation to determine whether Ravnsborg may have committed an impeachable offense surrounding the crash, some lawmakers have questioned whether Noem and Price applied undue pressure on prosecutors as she pushed for Ravnsborg to be forced from his office. Prosecutors last month told the impeachment investigation they were displeased by the governor's decision to release video of Ravnsborg being interviewed by detectives while he was still facing charges. “Some members of the committee appear more interested in discovering why information was provided to the public as opposed to the facts of the investigation,” Price wrote in the letter. Noem has called for the attorney general to resign and repeatedly pushed lawmakers to bring impeachment charges against him. Ravnsborg pled no contest to a pair of misdemeanors in the crash in August, but has cast it as a tragic accident. But Price, who previously said he thought Ravnsborg should have faced manslaughter charges, said the investigation showed Joseph Boever, who was walking near a rural highway, “was killed because the attorney general had been distracted.” Ravnsborg initially told a 911 dispatcher after the crash that he did not know what he hit and surmised that he hit an animal. He later told investigators that the last thing he remembered before the crash was turning off the radio and looking down at the speedometer. Ravnsborg has insisted he did not realize he had killed Boever until he returned to the scene the next day and discovered his body. The House impeachment committee is set to meet Thursday to decide how to wrap up its investigation. The committee has been tasked with making a recommendation to the rest of the House on whether Ravsnborg should face impeachment charges. But Gosch said that Noem's move throws the committee's work into doubt. “We have to have a serious conversation as to what we can do next or if we can even proceed as a legislative body in the impeachment process,” he said. “That's how bad this has become.” House Democratic leader Rep. Jamie Smith, who has previously called for Ravnsborg's impeachment and is a part of the House investigation, said he would let the investigation process conclude before he decided to renew calls for Ravnsborg to step down or be impeached. “Timing wise, it’s unfortunate,” he said of Price's letter. “It muddies the water.”",Politics/Associated Press,South Dakota official: Attorney general 'unfit' for office,https://news.yahoo.com/noem-official-sd-attorney-general-010613748.html
