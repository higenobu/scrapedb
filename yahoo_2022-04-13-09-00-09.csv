4/13/2022,"Xavier Ortiz went to the ER with a headache and numbness, but clinicians dismissed it as a migraine. The next day he had a seizure, went into a coma, and was later diagnosed with a brainstem clot. A year later, Ortiz can't walk or talk. His family is urging people to know the signs of stroke. At first, Xavier Ortiz wasn't too worried about his headache and sensitivity to noise, which set in one day last April. He was 20 years old and healthy, and suppressed his discomfort enough to play basketball with his friends. But on the court, a few of the pals, who are nurses, noticed Ortiz's drifting eye and urged him to go the ER. While there, he complained of a severe headache, light sensitivity, blurry vision, dizziness, and numbness on one side of his body, according to his girlfriend Natasha Sanchez, who had driven Ortiz there. ""He wanted all the lights off, he was covering his eyes, he was like, 'My head's killing me,'"" Sanchez remembers. According to Sanchez, the clinician told them it was a migraine, gave Ortiz an IV and pain meds, and sent him on his way. Sanchez and Ortiz's mom, who had joined them by that point, had to carry him out to the car. ""I was like, 'How is this normal?'"" Sanchez told Insider. It wasn't: The next day, Sanchez awoke to Ortiz seizing in bed. She called an ambulance, but says the EMTs didn't share her urgency. One said, ""it's probably just a cold,'"" Sanchez said. At the hospital, clinicians suspected drugs, but Ortiz doesn't use drugs or drink, his stepmom Jackie Ortiz said. They thought it was a reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine, but Ortiz hadn't gotten one yet. It wasn't until the next day when a second neurologist looked at Ortiz's brain scans that the family learned he'd had a serious stroke and had only a 3% chance of survival. The hospitals had missed their window to operate on the clot, which was in his brain stem, Jackie Ortiz said a neurological surgeon told them later. The family is sharing their story to raise awareness about stroke symptoms in young people. The diagnosis is ""not something you expect to hear, it sends chills up and down your spine,"" Jackie Ortiz said. ""I think we all lived in this dark cloud and thinking that this is a nightmare we couldn't wake up from."" Ortiz, now 21, was in a medically-induced coma for several weeks and underwent inpatient rehab for several more. Now, one year later, he's home but can't speak, walk, or take care of himself, despite being fully cognitively aware of what's going on, Jackie Ortiz said. Prior to his stroke, he had graduated from a technical college and was about to apply for an apprenticeship. Ortiz continues to undergo speech therapy, and is enrolling in aquatic and music therapy. He uses eye movements and a book with letters to communicate with his big blended family. His mom and stepmom trade off work-from-home days to care for him. ""You sit here, you look at your 20-, 21-year old son that you're about to say, 'OK, go out and be independent, become this man in the world that you wanna become,'"" Jackie Ortiz said. ""And then he essentially become this man that is a baby in some ways again."" But Jackie Ortiz said her stepson is in ""amazing spirits."" ""He wants to be walking again. He wants to bring awareness to this and just live a fulfilled life again,"" she said. ""Because you only live once, but he got a second chance, so live life to the fullest."" Only about 10% of strokes occur in people younger than 50, and the risk goes down the younger you are, Dr. Donald M. Lloyd-Jones, president of the American Heart Association, previously told Insider. Strokes occur when there's a disruption of blood flow to the brain, typically either from a clot that's traveled to the brain or from spontaneous brain bleeding. Symptoms include facial drooping, arm weakness, and speech difficulty. Ortiz's family doesn't know why his stroke occurred. While some factors like race and a family history of strokes you can't control, others like not smoking and managing your blood pressure you can. Estrogen-containing hormonal birth control — especially among smokers — can also increase the risk. There have been a few reports of strokes post-COVID-19 vaccine, but they're ""exceedingly rare,"" studies show. How quickly patients get treatment affects the severity and length of any complications that follow, which can include UTIs, pneumonia, paralysis, speech and swallowing difficulties, memory loss, and even personality changes and a propensity for profanity. ""Minutes matter in terms of saving brain tissue and brain function,"" Lloyd-Jones said. That's why Jackie Ortiz is urging people to know the signs and to speak up if they think something with a loved one is wrong. She wonders what would have happened had her husband taken Ortiz the ER that first night, since young people and women are more often dismissed by medical professionals. ""Maybe things would've been different for us,"" she said. Read the original article on Insider",Health/INSIDER,"Doctors diagnosed a 20-year-old's stroke symptoms as a migraine and sent him home.

4/13/2022,"It's one of the main drivers of U.S. inflation reaching a 40-year high, and among the factors most likely to hurt Democrats’ electoral chances in the November midterms. It’s high gasoline prices, and President Joe Biden is starting to get creative in trying to lower them. U.S. gas prices currently average $4.27 per gallon, a sharp decline after a mid-March high that caused drivers to put in fewer miles on the road, sending demand for gas plummeting. But the national average is still well over $1 more per gallon relative to a year ago, and the current decline by no means indicates that prices won’t rise again. As summer nears, and demand for gas inevitably grows, a limited gas supply could lead to prices exceeding $5. One U.S. diplomat even warned that an inability to import more gas could cause prices to rise as high as $6 this year, something that has already happened in some parts of the country Biden is desperate to reduce prices, and he announced his latest measure to do so on Tuesday. Speaking from a bioprocessing and ethanol manufacturing plant in Menlo, Iowa, Biden announced that he would make gasoline blended with ethanol available year-round instead of suspending its sale during summers. Ethanol blended fuel is slightly more affordable, and Biden hopes the plan will bring prices down significantly at the pump, but the President will likely encounter resistance as ethanol fuel has for years drawn the ire of environmental and energy groups, to the point that the Environmental Protection Agency had banned its sale during summers since 2011. The type of fuel Biden is targeting is known as E15 gasoline, a petroleum fuel combined with a 15% ethanol blend. Ethanol is made from the fermentation of starchy plants, usually corn. Since 2011, the EPA has banned the sale of E15 in most of the country from June 1 and Sept. 15, because it contributes to air pollution when outside temperatures are high. E15 is still sold in 30 states, but only at around one out of every 65 gas stations in the country, according to the Department of Energy. A less potent form of the mixture—known as E10, which only uses a 10% ethanol blend—has been approved for general use by the EPA for years. In a call previewing Tuesday's announcement, reported by Reuters, Biden administration officials said that the ethanol blend will be 10 cents cheaper per gallon on average than regular gas. “Those savings can add up, especially during the summer months, when fuel is elevated,” one White House representative said. For E15 to be sold during summer, Biden has requested a waiver from the EPA, although it would not be the first time the agency will have granted one. In 2019, the Trump White House filed a similar request, citing a “​​commitment to energy independence, regulatory reform, and increasing the use of biofuels to give consumers more choices.” The EPA granted the waiver, achieving rare condemnation from both environmental groups, which worried about the health and climate risks of E15, and oil companies, which did not want biofuels to cut into their profits. For Biden, the priority is to reduce gas prices, and do it fast. High gas prices are now a leading cause of inflation, and the President and his party are being blamed by many voters for prolonged high prices at the pump. The White House has tried to place responsibility for high gasoline prices on Russia and its ongoing war in Ukraine, and even calling the surge “Putin’s price hike.” Biden has already tried several strategies to increase oil supply and lower prices. The U.S. is spearheading a global effort to release 240 million barrels of oil from emergency reserves before the end of the year, with 180 million coming from the U.S.. Biden is also pushing for U.S. oil companies to ramp up production, and has made diplomatic approaches to increase oil trade flows with other countries.

4/13/2022,"(Reuters) -Authorities in four Russian regions bordering Ukraine and in Russian-controlled Crimea announced they were stepping up security measures on Monday over what they said were ""possible provocations"" from the Ukrainian side. Moscow, which sent thousands of troops into Ukraine in what it calls a ""special military operation"", has accused Ukraine of targeting its border regions, including by striking a fuel depot in the city of Belgorod earlier this month. The authorities in the Belgorod, Voronezh, Bryansk and Krasnodar regions and in Crimea said they were boosting security and urged citizens to be more vigilant. Another region bordering Ukraine, Kursk, was the first to announce similar measures on Sunday. ""During the special operation by Russian forces on the territory of Ukraine, the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic, issues pertaining to anti-terrorist security have become more pressing due to possible provocations from Ukrainian nationalists,"" said Alexander Gusev, the governor of the Voronezh region, which shares a border with Ukraine's Luhansk region. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Belgorod region, said it would implement additional security measures until April 25 to counter what he called terrorist threats. The region borders Ukraine's Sumy, Kharkiv and Luhansk regions. Gladkov said the population should steer clear of crowded public places, carry identity documents on them, have an evacuation plan and pay special attention to strangers and unusual vehicles near residential buildings. The Bryansk region, which shares a border with Ukraine's Sumy and Chernihiv regions, said it was also on alert for terrorist threats. The governors of the Krasnodar region, across the Sea of Azov from east Ukraine, and of Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, said they were raising ""terrorism alerts"" and would strengthen law enforcement in several districts. On Sunday, the governor of the Kursk region, Roman Starovoit, said police and military officers would set up checkpoints, less than a week after border guards allegedly came under fire in the region. Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.
