1/25/2022,"By Nancy Lapid (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review. Omicron survives longer on plastic and skin The Omicron variant can survive longer than earlier versions of the coronavirus on plastic surfaces and human skin, Japanese researchers found in laboratory tests. Its high ""environmental stability"" - its ability to remain infectious - might have helped Omicron replace Delta as the dominant variant and spread rapidly, they said. On plastic surfaces, average survival times of the original strain and the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants were 56 hours, 191.3 hours, 156.6 hours, 59.3 hours, and 114.0 hours, respectively. That compared to 193.5 hours for Omicron, the researchers reported on bioRxiv ahead of peer review. On skin samples from cadavers, average virus survival times were 8.6 hours for the original version, 19.6 hours for Alpha, 19.1 hours for Beta, 11.0 hours Gamma, 16.8 hours for Delta and 21.1 hours for Omicron. On skin, all of the variants were completely inactivated by 15 seconds of exposure to alcohol-based hand sanitizers. ""Therefore,"" the researchers conclude, ""it is highly recommended that current infection control (hand hygiene) practices use disinfectants... as proposed by the World Health Organization."" Nose swabbing best for rapid antigen tests Users of rapid antigen tests to detect COVID-19 should swab their nostrils as directed by the manufacturer and not swab the throat or cheek instead, new research shows. Earlier this month, with Omicron accounting for nearly all coronavirus infections in San Francisco, researchers there performed both PCR and Abbott Laboratories' BinaxNOW rapid antigen test on 731 people requesting COVID-19 tests. Nasal swabbing ""detected over 95% of persons with the highest levels of virus who are most likely contagious,"" said Dr. Diane Havlir of the University of California, San Francisco. In 115 volunteers with positive PCR tests, her team compared BinaxNOW results using swab samples from the nose and the throat obtained by trained professionals. Throat swabs detected nearly 40% fewer cases than nose swabs, they reported on medRxiv ahead of peer review. A separate study from Spain, also posted on medRxiv, found that swabbing the inside of the cheek also is far less reliable than nostril swabbing for detecting infectious virus. Recent studies had suggested that Omicron is detectable earlier in the throat than in the nose, leading some experts to advise users to swab the throat, although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration maintained the tests should be used as directed. ""These data support using BinaxNOW from nasal swabs as directed on the package,"" Havlir said. ""Repeat rapid testing is recommended for those with negative BinaxNOW rapid tests and symptoms or an exposure"" to an infected person. Long-term care facilities hit less hard by Omicron Even the highly vulnerable residents of long-term care facilities are generally experiencing less severe disease from Omicron than from earlier versions of the coronavirus, according to new data. Researchers in England compared hospitalization rates in residents of 333 facilities before and after the Omicron variant became dominant. Among 398 residents infected prior to the emergence of Omicron, 10.8% required hospitalization, compared with 4% of 1,241 infected with Omicron. The average age of infected residents was 85 years. After accounting for other risk factors, the odds of hospitalization were 50% lower for infected patients in the Omicron period, the researchers reported on Sunday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. While most facility residents had been vaccinated and about 10% had been previously infected, the reduction in relative risk of hospitalization between the pre-Omicron and Omicron periods was greatest among Omicron-infected patients who had received vaccine booster doses, at 77%. The researchers have also seen fewer deaths from COVID-19 in the Omicron period, although they said it was too soon to draw firm conclusions about the variant's effect of mortality. ""Overall,"" they conclude, ""the markedly decreased severity combined with high vaccination uptake and prior natural infection can be expected to significantly limit the impact of the current wave of Omicron infections on hospitalizations and deaths in residents of long-term care facilities.""

1/25/2022,"The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group entered the Mediterranean sea last week amid growing tensions with Russia. The exercise, known as Neptune Strike 22, has been in the works since 2020, the Pentagon said. Russia has amassed nearly 100,000 troops at Ukraine's border. As tensions with Russia threaten to boil over, the USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group was sent to the Mediterranean as part of a NATO exercise, the Pentagon announced last week. Department of Defense Press Secretary John Kirby told reporters the carrier group will ""demonstrate NATO's ability to integrate the high-end maritime strike capabilities of an aircraft carrier strike group to support the deterrence and defense of the alliance."" The exercise is the first time NATO has commanded a full US carrier strike group since the Cold War, the alliance said in a news release, a sign of the alliance's heightening readiness in the wake of Russia's 2014 seizure of Crimea from Ukraine. The carrier Truman is accompanied by the US cruiser San Jacinto and the destroyers Bainbridge, Cole, Gravely and Jason Dunham. Kirby said the demonstration was not a direct response to the most recent Russian aggressions at the Ukrainian border and had been in the works since 2020. The NATO exercise will last 12 days, starting January 24 and ending on February 4. Russia has amassed nearly 100,000 troops in areas near Ukraine's borders, using their presence and live-fire exercises in an apparent attempt to intimidate their neighbor. Ukraine isn't a member of NATO, but the US has vowed to respond with harsh sanctions if Russian President Vladimir Putin launches another offensive, similar to his seizure by force of Crimea from the former Soviet republic. Tensions between Ukraine and Russia are the highest they've been in years, and the U.S. Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Russia ""could at any point launch an attack on Ukraine."" But Moscow denies it is gearing up to attack on the former Soviet state, arguing instead that NATO are aggressors on Russia's Western flank. A complete Russian takeover of Ukraine would bring its border right up against NATO allied countries like Poland and Romania, creating a flashpoint between the two nuclear-armed sides. Kirby declined to say why exactly NATO continued with the exercise while hostility with Russia continue to rise. ""We constantly look at exercises and training and ask ourselves … do we really need to do it now? Should we speed it up? Should we shorten it?"" he said. ""There was due consideration given about tensions right now about our exercise posture and after all that consideration and discussion with our NATO allies, the decision was made to move ahead."" Other NATO allies — including Denmark, Lithuania, Spain, France, and The Netherlands — are also deploying fighter jets and ships into Eastern Europe. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg lauded the allies for their contributions. ""NATO will continue to take all necessary measures to protect and defend all Allies, including by reinforcing the eastern part of the Alliance,"" he said. ""We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defence.""

1/25/2022,"TOKYO (AP) — Japan's government plans to put the majority of the country under pre-emergency status and extend COVID-19 restrictions as omicron cases have surged and threatened to disrupt basic services like hospitals and schools. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Monday that he will tighten anti-virus measures in 18 more prefectures, including Hokkaido in the north to Osaka and Kyoto in western Japan, until Feb. 20. This will be in addition to areas where similar restrictions are already in place or to be further extended — including Tokyo, Okinawa, Yamaguchi and Hiroshima. “Many people are feeling increasingly uneasy as the infections rapidly spread,” Kishida told reporters. “I want to obtain the people’s cooperation to overcome this crisis.” Kishida said he will officially announce the measures Tuesday after consulting with a government panel that includes health experts. Kishida added that the government has ordered COVID-19 test kit makers to boost production so that testing capacity can be increased to 800,000 per day, in the face of persistent shortages in Japan. In some areas where test kits have run out, the health ministry said COVID-19 patients can be diagnosed based on symptoms, without tests. Under the latest measures, most eateries are asked to close by latest 9 p.m. in exchange for government subsidies, with some restrictions on large public events. Critics say the measures, which almost exclusively target bars and restaurants, make little sense and are unfair. Japan has resisted the use of lockdowns to limit the spread of the virus as the government seeks to minimize damage to the economy. Even so, Japanese are increasingly becoming less cooperative to social distancing and other restrictions. Tough border controls that are scheduled to last through the end of February have also triggered criticism from foreign students and scholars who say the measures are not scientific. Surging infections have already begun to paralyze hospitals, schools and other sectors in some areas. The health ministry said more than 300 nursery schools had to be closed because of the high number of children, as well as staff infected or their colleagues who were forced into self-isolation after close contact with confirmed cases. So far, hospitals are not overflowing as in earlier waves, but experts say the rapid upsurge of the cases could overwhelm the medical system once the infections spread among the elderly population who are more likely to become seriously ill. While about 80% of Japanese have received their first two vaccine doses, the rollout of booster shots has been slow and has reached only 1.9 % of the population so far. Tokyo logged 8,503 new cases Monday, double from a week ago. Nationwide, nearly 45,000 virus cases were reported for an accumulated total of about 2 million, with about 18,500 deaths.",World/Associated Press,Japan to widen virus measures and boost testing amid omicron,https://news.yahoo.com/japan-widen-virus-measures-boost-132035218.html
1/25/2022,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The world’s biggest, most powerful space telescope reached its final destination 1 million miles from Earth on Monday, a month after it lifted off on a quest to behold the dawn of the universe. On command, the James Webb Space Telescope fired its rocket thrusters for nearly five minutes to go into orbit around the sun at its designated spot, and NASA confirmed the operation went as planned. The mirrors on the $10 billion observatory still must be meticulously aligned and the infrared detectors sufficiently chilled before science observations can begin in June. But flight controllers in Baltimore were euphoric after chalking up another success. ""We’re one step closer to uncovering the mysteries of the universe. And I can’t wait to see Webb’s first new views of the universe this summer!” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement. The telescope will enable astronomers to peer back further in time than ever before, all the way back to when the first stars and galaxies were forming 13.7 billion years ago. That's a mere 100 million years from the Big Bang, when the universe was created. Besides making stellar observations, Webb will scan the atmospheres of alien worlds for possible signs of life. The high-flying drama began within days of liftoff. A sunshield as big as a tennis court stretched open on the telescope in early January, 1 1/2 weeks after the Christmas Day launch from French Guiana. The observatory’s gold-coated mirror — 21 feet (6.5 meters) across — unfolded a few days later. Monday's thruster firing put the telescope into orbit around the sun at the so-called second Lagrange point, where the gravitational forces of the sun and Earth balance. The 7-ton spacecraft always faces Earth's night side to keep its infrared detectors as frigid as possible. At 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away, Webb is more than four times as distant as the moon. Considered the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, which orbits 330 miles (530 kilometers) up, Webb is too far away for emergency repairs. That makes the milestones over the past month — and the ones ahead — all the more critical. Spacewalking astronauts performed surgery five times on Hubble. The first operation, in 1993, corrected the telescope's blurry vision, a flaw introduced during the mirror's construction on the ground. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.
