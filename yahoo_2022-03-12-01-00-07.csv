3/12/2022,"Chances are if you run into a wild hog, you’re going to immediately think danger, then that creature doesn’t belong here, even though it’s been in South Carolina for generations. They were brought over by the Spaniards in the 1500s and have been tearing up the landscape ever since, slowly working their way from coast to plains to mountains. They’re everywhere. But not as easily seen — or possibly recognized — are many other animals not native to South Carolina that are wreaking havoc everywhere they go, boring into trees, eating vegetables and attacking native species. Here are a few to be looking for. Clemson University’s College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences says it like this: These bugs were a pest in China ad they are a bigger pest here. These stinkbugs harm fruit trees, legumes, corn, garden vegetables and some ornamental plants. And then when winter comes, they come inside. And as you can imagine by their name, when disturbed they emit an odor some people compare to a skunk, burned trees or cilantro. The bug was first seen in 1998 in Allentown, Pennsylvania, (accidental introduction, like many other invasive species) and then they moseyed on across the country. This snail can grow to be 6 inches long with a spiral shell and bands of yellow, black, tan and brown. Their beauty is probably what attracted people who keep aquariums. But then they got loose. Jon Storm, University of South Carolina Upstate biologist, said they were first seen in the wild in Myrtle Beach in 2008. They attach their eggs — clusters of up to 2,000 at a time — on vegetables and tree trunks. Storm said the snail’s eggs can carry rat lungworm, a parasite that can cause meningitis in people. “Don’t touch egg masses,” Storm said. This insect feeds on all manner of trees South Carolinians hold dear — maple, ash, poplar, sycamore, willow, elm and birch. They bore into the trunk and stem the flow of sap, leaving holes as big as a finger. It was first found last year by a homeowner in Hollywood, South Carolina. A Clemson University Department of Plant Industry inspector went to the property and found at least four infested maple trees and captured live beetles. It’s also in Ohio, New York and Massachusetts, thought to have been brought to the United States by cargo ships. So far, the longhorned beetle has been eradicated in New Jersey and Illinois. A particularly ugly lizard, this invader will eat anything, Will Dillman, the chief of wildlife for the South Carolina Department, told The State last year. That includes all manner of eggs from birds to alligators. People bought them for pets and then as they grow to their adult size — up to 4 feet — people send them out to fend for themselves. And they reproduce. South Carolina wildlife officials said the lizard’s ever-growing population became a concern in 2020. Florida and Georgia already have a problem with them. “With tegus, we know introductions are occurring, so then we’re trying to prevent it from getting established,” Dillman said. They’ve been seen in various parts of the state, including Richland and Lexington counties. South Carolina last year banned the Argentine black and white tegu and required owners to register their pets with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. Storm said if you find one don’t try to pick it up. It has a pretty nasty bite. The Department of Natural Resources should be your first call. Voracious. Planthopper. Eat more that 100 plants — fruit, ornamental, and woody trees. It was seen first in 2014 in Pennsylvania and has hopped aboard all kinds of vehicles to mail its way south, as close as North Carolina. It came from Southeast Asia and prefers the Tree of Heaven, also an invasive species and also in South Carolina. But that’s no benefit because the Spotted Lanternfly is just not that picky. It also likes grapes, hops. almonds, apples, apricots, cherries, peaches, plums, nectarines, maples, oaks, yellow poplars, sycamores, walnuts and willows. It’s also sort of icky because it excretes massive amounts of sticky honeydew that can get on people. This beauty has long been a standout in home aquariums but are now found in the deep ocean and rocky reefs. They are often seen by scuba divers and caught by fishermen chasing marlin, dolphin, wahoo and yellowfin tuna. These fish are also hungrily searching and consuming game fish. The lionfish’s home base is the Indo-Pacific region, Storm said. But here’s a rub; their spine holds a similar toxin to that of a cobra. If you touch it, the sting likely won’t kill you but it sure will hurt. As in throbbing pain, swelling, bleeding and numbness. If you catch one, Storm said, do not throw it back.",Science/The State,6 invasive species that have wreaked havoc in South Carolina.

3/12/2022,"Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, sent a not-so-subtle sartorial message to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday’s broadcast of “The Late Show.” Yovanovitch wore a bracelet featuring the words, “Fuck You Putin.” The diplomat bought the bracelets in bulk during her time serving in Ukraine and she’d regularly give them to visitors to the U.S. Embassy, she told host Stephen Colbert. She gave one to the comedian. See Yovanovitch’s comments here: Yovanovitch was recalled from her ambassadorship in 2019 following a smear campaign from Donald Trump allies amid the former president’s first impeachment inquiry for attempting to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for dirt on Joe Biden. Trump’s conduct showed Putin and other autocrats that Trump was “ready to use our national security for his own personal and political gain,” she said. “I think that really undermined our national security and our abilities to move forward when people could see the president of the United States was ready to not be acting in the interests of the nation, but in his own personal interests,” Yovanovitch added.

3/12/2022,"Mar. 10—Three now-dead cougars that found their way onto Flathead Lake's Wild Horse Island handily hunted down its bighorn sheep herd to as few as 35 of the prized Rocky Mountain ungulates. Although an initial sum, it's the lowest sheep count on the isle in at least 20 years, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. About 130 sheep were tallied on the island state park in 2019, with a couple dozen later removed by the department to help reestablish a herd in southwestern Montana. All told, the three adult mountain lions — which either swam to the island or accessed its shores via ice-bridge during recent winters — appear to have killed some 70 of the vulnerable bighorns before being killed by local wildlife officials over the past roughly two months. Sheep might now have to be moved to the island that has served as a prime source for nearly 600 disease-free bighorns to Montana, Washington and Oregon over the last half-century. If approved, it would be the first time in more than three decades that bighorns have been transplanted to Wild Horse Island to augment the herd and maintain a healthy genetic pool. An on-the-ground count estimates that 35 sheep remain on the island. ""That's what groups of people have seen; we haven't done a flight (survey) yet,"" Neil Anderson, regional FWP wildlife program manager, said of the more thorough method of counting the island's population. The department announced last week that one adult female and two adult male lions were killed over the winter to protect park visitors and to shield bighorn sheep lacking escape on the nearly 3.4-square-mile island. ""I think what people don't really realize is that Wild Horse Island has almost no escape terrain for bighorn sheep,"" Anderson said of cliffy, rocky areas that the agile sheep hoof to avoid threats. ""So, they're pretty vulnerable to predation,"" he said. ""To have that many mountain lions on the island, they could do a pretty good number on the sheep."" An adult male mountain lion's home range typically spans more than 100 square miles, with that of a female's being up to 60 square miles, according to the Forest Service. Robust in Montana, the big cats mostly eat deer but are known to eat anything from grasshoppers to moose, according to the Montana Field Guide. Wildlife officials plan to conduct a flight survey this spring to assess the cougars' damage to the prized sheep herd. Two bighorns were initially introduced to the island in 1939, having since thrived remotely with limited predation and no documented diseases. Ten total sheep have been transplanted to the island over the years, the last time being in 1987, when two bighorns were moved there from Lincoln County, according to Montana State Parks. Wildlife officials believe the three cougars — known as cunning, elusive creatures — either swam to the island or more likely accessed its shores in recent winters atop ice. In 2019, Flathead Lake nearly froze over for the first time since the early 1990s, though lake waters surrounding the island could have frozen more recently for the cats to gain access. Wild Horse Island lies just off the western shore of Flathead Lake, within the Flathead Reservation. FWP collaborated with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes to remove the big cats. Wild Horse Island has produced some of the largest rams in the world, according to FWP. The department typically aims for an island population of between 100 to 120 bighorns to limit the environmental impact to the land, Anderson said. He said a 2019 island survey showed about 130. FWP removed 26 sheep last year to help reestablish a herd in Southwest Montana's Tendoy Mountains and maintain a sustainable herd for the island. That's about when sheep numbers began dropping. ""It started going down pretty significantly after that,"" Anderson said, also noting there remains no evidence showing the sheep dying off from disease. ""The logical explanation is predation."" Bear and lion have been documented on the island, ""but what people were starting to see is lions being more accustomed to some of the housing out there,"" he said of nearby landowners.

3/12/2022,"The war in Ukraine has been a been marked by a strong resistance which it is believes the Russians did not anticipate and has left Vladimir Putin frustrated and angry. The war effort has seen civilians take up arms against Russian troops, while the country has also been supplied with a significant amount of weapons from the West. One of the most important aspects of this has been the thousands of anti-tank weapons that have poured into the country, but what are they and have they made a difference? Numerous allies - including the UK, Germany, France, US and Denmark - have supplied Ukraine with anti-tank weapons since the start of the conflict. Each missile costs around £130,000, but that is nowhere near as expensive as the tanks they are fired at. Numerous different types of anti-tank weapons have been handed to Kyiv, including Javelins and Next Generation Light Antitank Weapons (NLAWs). Read more: Russia falsely claims pregnant beauty blogger caught up in hospital bombing is faking injuries with make-up Generally, the Americans have been supplying Javelins, while the Europeans have been providing NLAWs. They are significantly more advanced than the basic RPGs the Ukrainians were equipped with in 2014. The basic premise of a modern anti-tank weapon is a small guided missile held by a single-use launcher. The launcher has an advanced targeting computer attached to it and targets specific weak spots on tanks. The computer does 95% of the work for the soldier, meaning all they have to do is pull the trigger and then get into cover. Watch: Ukraine war: Drone footage shows Russian tank column retreat after artillery ambush The weak spot is usually the turret or the area between the turret and the main body of the tank. The armour-piercing missile usually completely disables a tank with a single shot. Javelin missiles fire straight up into the air before arcing back down to hit the top of the tank and have a much longer range than NLAWs (4.5km compare to 1km). They weigh around 12kg, which is carriable for a single soldier, but once the missile has been fired, the huge launcher is then useless. Read more: What is a thermobaric 'vacuum' bomb and why is it so devastating? NLAW's are also designed to be able to be taught how to use weapon to learn to use, reportedly taking around an hour. With the fact they can be operated by one or two soldiers they have significantly advanced ground combat, making tanks' previous dominance much reduced. Although hard facts are difficult to confirm in such a fluid situation, it appears the supply of anti-tank weapons to Ukraine has caused significant damage to the Russian advance. Numerous videos of the targeted missiles being shot at Russian armour have appeared on social media. Even more pictures of destroyed tanks have circulated around the internet. Russia has the largest number of tanks in the world, although many of these are fairly old Soviet models. Ukraine claims to have destroyed 465 heavy vehicles (tanks, armoured fighting vehicles, infantry fighting vehicles, armoured personnel carriers) since the start of fighting. Although the Russians are losing lots of armour, videos in recent days appear to show them employing weapons to counter anti-tank missiles. Several Russian tanks have been pictured with wire and steel ""cope cages"" attached to their turrets. The purpose of these is to force the missile to explode just before impacting the actual turret itself, hopefully mitigating the damage. The effectiveness of these cages is not yet known.",World/Yahoo News UK,What is an anti-tank weapon and how do they work?,https://news.yahoo.com/what-is-an-anti-tank-weapon-and-why-are-they-making-so-much-difference-in-ukraine-092149434.html
