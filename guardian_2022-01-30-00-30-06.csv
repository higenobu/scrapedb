1/30/2022,"Rory McIlroy publicly places little stock in two previous wins at the Dubai Desert Classic but one can be certain the rest of those vying for the famous trophy are well aware of his record at the Emirates Club. Should he prevail here, McIlroy would join Ernie Els as a three-times Desert Classic champion. “I live in Ernie’s old house in Florida,” said McIlroy. “It would be nice to do something else sort of intertwined with him.”  McIlroy’s 69 – one stroke more than the best round in an 81-strong third-round field – puts him in the final group in his second start of 2022. Justin Harding produced his highest score of the week, 71, but still leads McIlroy’s 10 under par by two. Tommy Fleetwood and Erik van Rooyen are firmly part of this equation at minus nine. Yet given his status and previous glories, all eyes are fixed on McIlroy. “I’m excited,” said McIlroy. “I had a really good chance in 2018 here and let it slip through my fingers. It is good to give myself another opportunity.” So what of course and distance specialism? “It’s a new tournament, it’s a new year,” McIlroy said. “It’s basically a new course. You just go out there and try to play your best. The only thing is more experience and being in these positions before. Winning around here twice is nice but I don’t think it gives me any sort of advantage.” Plenty will disagree. The hype around McIlroy, especially with another Masters tilt on the horizon, will intensify should be complete the three-timer. Having played the front nine in 34, one under, McIlroy’s day was kickstarted by an eagle three at the 10th. He converted a putt from 16ft there. In increasingly testing conditions, with the greens particularly slick, McIlroy was on course for a 70 before reaching the 18th green in two and making a two-putt for birdie appear blissfully straightforward. “There has definitely been progress,” he said of his week. This would easily be the biggest triumph of Harding’s career. It is only slightly unfair to point out his main claim to fame is dating a former winner of The Apprentice. Not that the South African is any mug; he has produced four bogeys in 54 holes. He also has little to lose on day four. “ I’ve just got to go out and keep doing what I’m doing,” he said. “Make a couple of birdies and shoot 70, 69, something like that, and make them shoot five or six under par, then credit to them. Just another day at the office.” Fleetwood’s return to prominence after a prolonged period of mediocrity has been widely welcomed. He added a 69 to rounds of 67 and 71. “I’m so excited about playing tomorrow, getting the juices flowing on a Sunday and seeing how my game goes,” he said. “I would love to be competing down that back stretch and who knows, it might be my week, might not be but I am excited about where my game is heading. You’re always looking for affirmations to say that what you’re doing is right, don’t sort of miss them as they come along, and I think today showed that.” Paul Casey is eight under; it would be better but for a missed putt from 3ft at the last. “I’m not going to be hard on myself,” said the defending champion. “It is a very, very difficult course.” Henrik Stenson, meanwhile, has offered the strongest indication yet that he wants to captain Europe at the 2023 Ryder Cup. The Swede’s situation is complicated by a continual link with a breakaway, Saudi-backed tour but he appears willing to prioritise the Ryder Cup. “I would prefer to leave that answer for the person who would ask the question but, yes, I am very much still interested,” he said. “I have a little bit of a rough idea what is involved. I have asked Thomas [Bjorn] about it, I have asked Pádraig [Harrington]. I asked Monty [Colin Montgomerie] when we played together this week.”",Sport/Sport,Rory McIlroy discounting past glories as he chases third Dubai Desert Classic,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/29/rory-mcilroy-discounting-past-glories-as-he-chases-third-dubai-desert-classic
1/30/2022,"A 95-year-old second world war veteran twice denied an absentee ballot under a restrictive Texas voting law has attracted support from prominent figures including Beto O’Rourke, a voting rights campaigner and former presidential candidate now running for Texas governor.  Kenneth Thompson, who served in the US army in Europe, told Click2Houston, a Harris county news outlet, he had voted in every election since he was 21 and even remembered paying a 50-cent poll tax in the 1950s. “I’ve been voting many, many years and I’ve never missed a vote,” he said, adding that he considers voting a duty. But under a voting restriction bill known as SB1 and passed last August, Thompson could be unable to meet the state’s 31 January voter registration deadline for an absentee ballot. According to the new law, Thompson is required to submit a social security or driver’s license number that matches state or county records. When Thompson registered to vote decades ago, however, such requirements were not in place. “He registered to vote in the 1940s and they didn’t require that,” said Delinda Holland, Thompson’s daughter. Support for Thompson has poured in, including from O’Rourke, who tweeted out Thompson’s story and a call to fight against voting laws introduced by Republicans seeking to restrict voting among communities likely to vote Democratic. “Now we need to fight for him by taking on [Governor Greg] Abbott’s voter suppression law that is making it harder for Kenneth and millions of other Texans to participate in our democracy,” O’Rourke tweeted. As Thompson did not meet new requirements under SB1, his application for an absentee ballot was denied twice. He says he was not notified either time by county officials and had to call to confirm his status himself. “There’s gonna be a lot of people not gonna vote,” said Thompson. “If I hadn’t have called in about mine, people wouldn’t have known.” On behalf of her dad, she said, Holland tried to call authorities including the office of the Texas secretary of state, seeking to add his license number to his registration file. She discovered there wasn’t a way to do so, which meant he would have to re-register. “We know it’s a new law, we’re happy to correct [his registration],” said Holland. “He’s a law-abiding citizen. He doesn’t want to miss voting and yet there’s no mechanism to add that driver’s license to your record.” Thompson said he now checked his mailbox every day, hoping his absentee ballot had arrived. If it did not, he said, he would vote in person. “I can get out and move around and go to a regular polling place,” he said, “but … lots of people just can’t.”",News/US news,Second world war veteran twice denied absentee ballot under Texas voting law,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/29/veteran-denied-absentee-ballot-texas-voting-law-beto-o-rourke

She graduated from Soas University of London with a degree in ethnomusicology and history and trained as a human rights lawyer before turning to a career in music. In 2017, Iqbal released her debut album, Weighing of the Heart. She is currently rerecording the follow-up after an early version was stolen during a visit to Karachi in 2020. Today and tomorrow, as part of the Purcell Sessions, Iqbal will perform new work at the Southbank Centre with visual artist and quantum physicist Libby Heaney, and she is currently working on a new album.  London Labour and the London Poor by Henry Mayhew I’m reading this book as research for my Southbank show, which uses the Thames as a focal point. It’s a comprehensive cross-section of what life was like for poor people in London in Victorian times. For me, as a Londoner born and bred and history being my favourite subject, it’s really interesting to read, because it’s so detailed. I’ve been reading about kids walking shoeless from Clerkenwell to St John’s Wood to sell flowers, and “pure finders”, who collected dog poo and sold it to tanneries. Jeff Buckley videos on YouTube Jeff Buckley was one of my favourite artists as a teenager and I’m rediscovering his work. The first time around was pre-YouTube, so I’d never seen a video of him performing. Now there are so many amazing videos of interviews and live shows. The recording of him performing Grace on the BBC Late Show is one of the best live performances I’ve ever seen. I also found a recording of him in New York singing a Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan song in Urdu. The audience laughs at him at first, but then you can feel them getting captivated. Leighton House, London This is one of my favourite places in London – the Holland Park house where the painter Frederic Leighton lived. It’s like stepping into a secret world. Leighton travelled a lot around the Middle East and became a big fan of Middle Eastern architecture, ceramics and tile work. It looks like a normal Victorian house from the outside, but inside there’s a beautiful courtyard, with blue tiles imported from Iran, Afghanistan and Syria, and a fountain in the middle. It’s just so peaceful and amazing – I wish I could live there. Arôme, London WC2 Arôme is a really nice Japanese-Parisian cafe in Covent Garden that’s quite new. They bake everything from scratch. They have amazing croissants and Japanese-style pastries and really good hot chocolate. It’s quite near my studio in Somerset House, so I like to go in there to treat myself. There are so many big chains in central London, and finding good independent places can be tricky, but Arôme is really good. The Stolen Maharajah – Britain’s Indian Royal, BBC Four This is a BBC documentary about the last ruler of the Sikh empire, Duleep Singh. His story is really sad. While he was still a boy, the British removed him from Lahore and he was later exiled to England. He became quite close to Queen Victoria and was accepted into the upper echelons of British society, but they wouldn’t let him go back to India. As he got older, he became really angry about his exile. It demonstrates how deeply the British empire affected people from the Indian subcontinent no matter their social status, rich or poor. It’s a really good documentary. Loch Long, Scotland I’m in Scotland at the moment, at an artist’s residency near Loch Long, about an hour north of Glasgow, trying to finish my album. I wanted to work on music without any distractions and this really is the middle of nowhere. It’s so magical – close to the water, with mountains all around, and really dark at night. If you live in a busy city and are trying to do creative work, I really recommend changing your surroundings.

1/30/2022,"Two heavily pregnant women – fortysomething photographer Janice (Penélope Cruz) and teenager Ana (Milena Smit) – share a room in a maternity hospital. The brief moment of kinship, forged through shared confidences, sweat and pain as they puff through labour in tandem, will bond them in ways they could never imagine. Meanwhile, Janice is dealing with the legacy of the Spanish civil war, which scarred her family and that of many of her compatriots. In other hands, this dual focus, which pulls us backwards and forwards, rooted in the past and driven to the future, might seem unwieldy. But Pedro Almodóvar makes a light-footed dance of it, negotiating story threads that extend over decades and tie up in the present day. This latest picture shares with his last full-length feature, Pain and Glory (2019), the message that secrets are best unearthed and confronted if there is any hope of moving forward. But unlike that film’s sumptuous sadness, and despite putting its characters through considerable suffering, Parallel Mothers is a story that is carried on an unexpected swell of optimism. Everything from the joyous colour palette – a cocktail of tangerine and turquoise, watermelon and lemon sorbet – to the Hitchcockian bustle of the score, gives a sense of promise and propulsion. But most of all, it’s Cruz who sets the tone, with a performance that radiates warmth and is refreshingly forgiving of her character’s flaws. She has never been better.

1/30/2022,"On the morning of 6 January, Boi Van Thang set out on a motorbike across the mountainous terrain of Chin state in western Myanmar. He would travel to a nearby village, he told his wife, and bring back meat for her and their seven children. He never returned. Three days later his wife, Thida Htwe, received a call. Boi Van Thang’s body had been found. The bodies of eight other men and one boy had also been discovered.  Thida Htwe said that her husband’s throat was cut, that he had a knife wound in his chest and as well as several in his back, and that one of his legs was broken. Photographs apparently from the scene, seen by the Observer, show a body that Thida Htwe identified as her husband. He is naked apart from his underwear, and his feet are tied. His clothes are in a pile beside his body. Further images provided by Chin Human Rights Organisation (CHRO) show other victims of the massacre who were reportedly found nearby. In one photograph, five bodies are lying beside one another; some have their hands tied or material placed over their eyes or mouth. They have numerous wounds to their throats, chests and stomachs. The youngest of those killed was 13. Chin journalist Pu Tui Dim was among the dead. He had been travelling with villagers, apparently on his way to visit family. He has been described as an “experienced ethnic media personnel who helped pave the way for independent news media in Chin state”. Almost one year ago, Myanmar’s military ousted the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and seized power in a coup. Since then, the country has descended into turmoil. The UN estimates the crisis will have driven almost half the population into poverty in 2022. Public services are barely functioning, as large numbers of teachers and medical staff are refusing to work in junta-controlled facilities, and instead operate their own networks. The military has used violence and terror to stamp out dissent and silence opponents. Some 1,500 people have been killed by the military, and 11,800 arrested, according to a local human rights group. But opposition remains. As well as peaceful protest movements, local civilian defence forces have emerged, some of which are supported by established ethnic armed groups. The military has in turn launched artillery and air strikes. In Chin state, where there is a strong resistance movement, as many as 80,000 people have been forced to flee their homes by fighting, according to the CHRO. Almost 900 were arrested between February and December last year alone, according to the group, while 182 people were killed during the same period. Some are thought to have been kidnapped and used as human shields. “I have lived through the previous military regime and I read stories and reports from all over Chin state,” said veteran activist Salai Za Uk Ling of the CHRO. “I have never seen this level of brutality in my life.” In December, more than 30 people, including children, were killed in Kayah state on Christmas Eve. Their bodies were found burned beyond recognition. Earlier in the month, the military rounded up and killed 11 people in the Sagaing region of Myanmar’s north-west. The group was shot and then set on fire, according to local media reports. Alongside such massacres, the military has increasingly deployed a scorched earth campaign as part of its intensifying reign of terror. Myanmar Witness, which collects evidence of military abuses, has corroborated 57 incidents where buildings in villages and other civilian areas have been set alight. Many have been attributed to the military. Extensive damage has been recorded within Thantlang, in northwest Chin state. Such violence was reminiscent of the Rohingya crackdown in Rakhine state in 2017, said Aung Myo Min, human rights minister of the National Unity Government (NUG), the administration in exile. “They sent more troops, they went village to village and torched all the houses, and forced the massive displacement to other areas,” he said. “It’s the same pattern.” The NUG is investigating the killing of Boi Van Thang and other civilians murdered that day. It will submit its findings to a group established by the UN Human Rights Council to collect evidence of violations of international law committed in Myanmar. “It is important for us to bring justice and make sure the culture of impunity is no longer in the future of Myanmar,” said Aung Myo Min. Activists suspect the junta has targeted Chin state because it wrongly believes local resistance can easily be silenced. “They always have this perception that the people of Chin state are weak and can be easily subjugated,” said Salai Za Uk Ling. The state, in western Myanmar, is the nation’s poorest, and home to the Chin people, a mostly Christian ethnic minority that has long suffered oppression in the Buddhist-majority country. Churches are among the buildings that have been torched. Activists say the military’s assumption that it could impose order in Chin state have been wildly inaccurate. According to CHRO, close to 80% of its civil servants are refusing to work after joining the civil disobedience movement. “The administrative apparatus no longer functions in Chin state apart from in towns or capitals like Hakha,” said Salai Za Uk Ling. Tuesday marks the first anniversary of the military’s seizure of power in Myanmar, he said, but added: “The coup has not succeeded yet.” In some villages, most young people had joined the armed resistance, he said. The murder of Boi Van Thang and others on 6 January has prompted a fresh wave of people from villages near to Matupi, a strategic crossroads in Chin state, to flee their homes. El Zamoon was among those who fled. He spent eight days travelling, mostly by foot, across steep roads to seek safety across the border in India’s Mizoram state. Children, exhausted, fell from their bikes along the journey. El Zamoon fled when the military began firing heavy artillery at his village. “Everyone here wants to go back to their homes, but they are afraid of the soldiers,” he said. Families of those killed left without the opportunity to hold a ceremony for their loved ones. Thida Htwe was unable to see her husband’s body or hold a memorial. She said he was a kind-hearted man who, in his spare time, would tutor village children. “He was only 38 and a good father to our kids,” she said. “Now I am left with seven kids. I don’t know how to raise them without him,” she said. When she sees other families she feels a deep sadness. “I wish he were here with us. We will never forget him.”",News/Global development,Myanmar’s junta torching ‘village after village’ in bid to quell opposition,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/29/myanmars-junta-torching-village-after-village-in-bid-to-quell-opposition
1/30/2022,"Ialready love the new Batman film, The Batman. I haven’t seen it, obviously, but its lofty self-importance keeps tickling me, from the definite article of the title to Robert Pattinson’s cut-glass cheekbones to the director Matt Reeves’s recent revelation that his Batman is inspired partly by Kurt Cobain. “Is this guy some kind of wayward, reckless drug addict? And the truth is that he is a kind of drug addict. His drug is his addiction to this drive for revenge. He’s like a Batman Kurt Cobain,” Reeves told Esquire, which I read written down, but I heard in an Alan Partridge voice. As I often think whenever I see socks with George Orwell’s face on them, it’s what he would have wanted. It’s unsurprising that the Seven-esque trailer makes The Batman look about as fun as Damon Albarn’s DMs after the Swifties had set upon him. Batman is inherently po-faced these days; the era of tights and little silicone nipples and terrible puns is long gone. Last week, the Hollywood Reporter revealed that The Batman is almost three hours long. That’s with credits, but you no longer get to shave off 10 minutes by leaving the cinema as soon as the director’s name comes up, in case you miss a post-credits sequence or a bloopers reel (in fairness, if there’s a bloopers reel here, I will eat my bat-cape).  Is it finally time to agree that three hours is too long for a film? A running time should not require a lavatory break and/or a brief nap for sustenance. Titanic was too long. The Irishman is so long that I still haven’t steeled myself to watch it. Three hours is an ordeal, not because of the debatable notion that our attention spans are declining, addled by dizzying TikToks and those pesky memes, but because I have never seen a film that is more than two-and-a half-hours long that wouldn’t have benefited from a flattering trim. The argument in favour of long films is that they give moviegoers more value for money. But there’s something cynical about the idea that making a film longer will somehow improve its quality. It’s double-spacing your homework, setting the font size to 14. The Batman may well earn every one of its 175 minutes, but in 2015, YouGov found that 55% of Brits believe the ideal movie length is under two hours. Using no scientific evidence whatsoever, I believe this: the ideal movie length is a neat, succinct, respectful and kind one hour and 39 minutes. In her new film Good Luck To You, Leo Grande, Emma Thompson plays a woman who hires a sex worker to help her have her first orgasm. Last week, she explained that she rehearsed for the part in the nude, along with her director, Sophie Hyde, and co-star Daryl McCormack. “It’s very challenging to be nude at 62,” she said during a CinemaCafe discussion at the Sundance festival. This is a transitional time for on-screen nudity. In recent weeks, full-frontal male nudity, usually doled out sparingly, has appeared on television with gusto. And Just Like That... famously showed Charlotte’s husband, Harry, whipping it out, with the show’s creator later confirming that it was a prosthetic. Meanwhile, teen tearaway show Euphoria, rarely coy about anything, has embraced both female and male nudity with extra enthusiasm for its second season. Yet Sydney Sweeney, who plays Cassie on Euphoria, pointed out that there remains a double standard when it comes to nudity. “When a guy has a sex scene or shows his body, he still wins awards and gets praise. But the moment a girl does it, it’s completely different,” she told the Independent, suggesting that she gets more acclaim for the roles in which she does not take her clothes off. Thompson said she didn’t think she could have done a nude scene before she was 62, though added that her age made it challenging, “because we aren’t used to seeing untreated bodies on the screen”. (The prosthetic, I suppose, would count as “treated”.) But we are used to bodies, treated or not, and for women it remains as complicated a decision as ever. There are some artists who are uncoverable, either because their songs are so idiosyncratic or because they have such unique, indescribable magic that it’s impossible to do them justice. For all of the times that people have tried, and basing this on my own experience of mangled karaoke, Abba are pretty uncoverable. Covers of Patti Smith seem tough to pull off, though conversely her covers are in a league of their own. I always thought of Frank Ocean as one of the uncoverable artists, for those same reasons. His songs are strangely structured, with their own language, and they are very much his alone. Yet this is the season of Ocean covers, suggesting that people are at least willing to give it a good go. Last week, Machine Gun Kelly released his version of Swim Good, which did not undermine my theory. Cat Power’s new album, Covers, opens with a version of Bad Religion and she has remade and reshaped it in her own image, which did undermine my theory. I went digging, and found a whole stash of new versions of Lost, by corrJoy Crookes, Khalid and Jorja Smith, all finding a different spirit in it. Not uncoverable, then, but it depends who’s doing the cover.

1/30/2022,"A dog that went viral when she was stolen and then found within hours thanks to a Twitter campaign has died aged 15. Cabbage, the collie cross of the former BBC journalist Rory Cellan-Jones, trended on Twitter last November when she and five other dogs were stolen together with a van in Acton, west London, after a dog walker left his keys in the ignition.  Cellan-Jones, 63, who thanked his 197,000 Twitter followers when all six dogs were found safely the same day, tweeted on Saturday morning: “We have some very sad news. We’ve had to say goodbye to our much loved collie cross Cabbage. “For 14 years she was a lovely, energetic and really smart member of our family. It was time for her to go but we miss her so much.” Thanking his followers for their support, Cellan-Jones added: “For me and Cabbage, an early walk was an essential part of our daily routine, good for our mental and physical health. This morning I went out as normal but the park seemed very empty. Thanks so much for all your kind messages.” Cabbage already had an online following before she was stolen because Cellan-Jones regularly documented their morning walks on his feed. On Friday morning he shared a picture of a final walk with Cabbage, writing: “Home after a gentle stroll.” The BBC Breakfast host Dan Walker and the Sky News broadcaster Ed Conway were among more than 1,000 wellwishers to offer their condolences. The BBC presenter Nuala McGovern wrote: “I’m so sorry Rory, loved Cabbage in my timeline basically telling me to get up and get moving outside.” When Cabbage went missing last winter, Cellan-Jones quickly alerted his followers and asked people to report any sightings, an appeal that was liked and shared thousands of times in what the journalist described as an “extraordinary outpouring of concern”. “Something terrible has happened,” he wrote at the time. “Our dog walker’s van with our dog Cabbage in it has been stolen while he was picking up another pet … Please look out for a black Ford Transit.” Ford’s press office subsequently got in touch to make the dog walker aware of a safety feature that allowed him to track his van through an app. The van was located in Park Royal and four of the dogs were soon found nearby. The other two were located the same evening. More than 60,000 Twitter users liked a picture celebrating Cabbage’s safe return, with Cellan-Jones saying after his dog was recovered: “Social media has lots of negative sides, but you can use it for really good purposes.”",News/UK news,Cabbage the Twitter-famous lost-and-found dog dies at 15,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/29/cabbage-the-twitter-famous-lost-and-found-dog-dies-at-15
1/30/2022,"A Republican senator complained on Friday that Joe Biden’s pick to replace Stephen Breyer on the supreme court will be a beneficiary of race-based affirmative action, at a time when the court seems poised to declare it unconstitutional.  The president has pledged to put the first Black woman on the court. Such pledges are not new. But Biden’s move has drawn protests among Republicans who did not object when in 2020 Donald Trump pledged to pick a woman to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Trump duly did so, the hardline Catholic conservative Amy Coney Barrett hurried on to the court to replace the liberal lion. That established a 6-3 conservative majority. Breyer has protested that the court is not political but his retirement at 83, announced this week, gives Biden a chance to install a younger liberal before Democrats defend control of the Senate. Biden’s pick will not affect the balance of a court which this week said it would consider a challenge to affirmative action based on race in college admissions. On Friday, the Mississippi senator Roger Wicker told a radio station in his state: “The irony is that the supreme court is at the very time hearing cases about this sort of affirmative racial discrimination while adding someone who is the beneficiary of this sort of quota. “The majority of the court may be saying writ large that it’s unconstitutional. We’ll see how that irony works out.” Many have seen plenty of irony in conservative complaints about Biden’s pledge to nominate based on race and gender. The historian Rick Perlstein was among those to point out that Ronald Reagan, the hero of the modern Republican party, chose a supreme court justice entirely because she was a woman. Shortly before his victory over Jimmy Carter in 1980, Reagan announced that “one of the first supreme court vacancies in my administration will be filled by the most qualified woman I can possibly find”. He duly nominated Sandra Day O’Connor, a political moderate and the first woman to sit on the court. “She was totally unqualified on paper,” Perlstein said, on Twitter. “[Zero] con[stitutional] law experience. Reagan lucked out.” Wicker also told SuperTalk Mississippi Radio he feared Biden’s pick would be more progressive than Breyer. “We’re going to go from a nice, stately liberal to someone who’s probably more in the style of Sonia Sotomayor,” the senator said, adding: “I hope it’s at least someone who will at least not misrepresent the facts. I think they will misinterpret the law.” Many observers made Ketanji Brown Jackson, 51 and a member of the US court of appeals for the DC circuit, favourite for Biden’s pick. Jackson replaced Merrick Garland, the nominee Republicans refused to give even a hearing in 2016, when Barack Obama picked him to replace Antonin Scalia, a hardline conservative. An era of bitter partisan contest ensued. This time, Democrats will court Republican moderates such as Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah. But Wicker said Biden’s pick would in all likelihood “not get a single Republican vote”. “But we will not treat her like the Democrats did Brett Kavanaugh,” he added, in reference to the bitter fight over Trump’s second nominee, who denied accusations of sexual assault. Democrats need only stick together. Thanks to a Republican rule change, nominees require only a simple majority. But Wicker pointed to a wish for at least symbolic vengeance, saying the Kavanaugh fight “was one of the most disgraceful, shameful things and completely untruthful things that [Democrats on the Senate judiciary committee have] ever, ever done”.",News/Law,Republican protests Biden’s pledge to put Black woman on supreme court,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/29/republicans-joe-biden-supreme-court-pick
