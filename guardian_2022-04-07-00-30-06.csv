4/7/2022,"Boris Johnson has said he does not “think that biological males should be competing in female sporting events”, amid the fallout from his decision not to ban conversion practices for people questioning their gender. Speaking on Wednesday, the prime minister said the issue “wasn’t something I thought that I would have to consider in great detail”. Johnson also said that women should have spaces in hospitals, prisons and changing rooms which were “dedicated to women”. “That’s as far as my thinking has developed on this issue,” Johnson told a journalist during a visit to a hospital in Hertfordshire. “And if that puts me in conflict with some others, then we have got to work it all out.” He added: “That doesn’t mean that I’m not immensely sympathetic to people who want to change gender, to transition, and it’s vital that we give people the maximum possible love and support in making those decisions. “But these are complex issues. And I don’t think they can be solved with one swift, easy piece of legislation … it takes a lot of thought to get this right.” He also insisted it was right to exclude people who were questioning their gender from a long-promised ban on so-called conversion “therapy”. After the resignation of a senior equality adviser and cancellation of the government’s flagship international LGBT conference in the face of a mass withdrawal of support from stakeholders, the prime minister said he was “sad” at their response. Despite some Tories pressing for No 10 to reverse its decision to take forward a ban on conversion practices only for those questioning their sexuality – not their gender – Johnson appeared to confirmed the decision taken last week was final. Johnson said: “I suppose I’d just make a few points: I don’t think that it’s reasonable for kids to be deemed so-called Gillick competent to take decisions about their gender or irreversible treatments that they may have. I think there should be parental involvement at the very least. That’s the first thing. “Second thing, I don’t think that biological males should be competing in female sporting events. And maybe that’s a controversial thing but it just seems to me to be sensible.” The prime minister added: “We will have a ban on gay conversion therapy, which to me is utterly abhorrent. “But there are complexities and sensitivities when you move from the area of sexuality to the question of gender. There, I’m afraid, there are things that I think still need to be worked out. “I’m sorry we haven’t been able to reach agreement with the organisations concerned but that will in no way diminish our determination to tackle prejudice wherever we can.” Johnson, and the previous government led by Theresa May, had promised for years to institute a ban on conversion practices, which critics say subject people questioning their sexuality or gender to undue pressure or, in the most extreme cases, torture. On Tuesday, Iain Anderson, the government’s LGBT+ adviser, stepped down and accused ministers of trying to drive a wedge between those who were gay, lesbian or bisexual and people who identified as transgender. He said: “Britain needs a strategy for trans people and I can’t see one at the moment. We have a tabloid debate going on about people’s lives. It’s not a respectful debate; it’s turned into a woke war.” The Tory MP Dehenna Davison also expressed concern at the cancellation of the Safe To Be Me conference, due to be held in June to put pressure on countries to adopt stronger rights for LGBT+ people. “We had such a huge opportunity to prove the UK (and the Conservative party) is a defender of freedom,” she posted on Twitter. “As a Conservative member of the LGBT+ community, it is so wrong it has come to this.” The Scottish Conservatives on Wednesday diverged from the Westminster party as they committed to voting for a ban on all conversion practices – including a ban on trans conversion practices – in forthcoming Holyrood legislation. But the Scottish party also announced that “supporting women’s spaces in council-run venues including schools, parks and swimming pools” would be a key plank of its manifesto for the May council elections.",News/Politics,Johnson says biological males ‘should not compete in female sporting events’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/06/johnson-says-trans-athletes-should-not-compete-in-sport-that-does-not-match-biological-sex

4/7/2022,"Late-night hosts enjoyed Barack Obama’s return to the White House on Tuesday, his first visit since the grim January morning in 2017 when he departed it with the newly elected Donald Trump. “That’s really gotta bother Trump,” Jimmy Kimmel said of the visit. “All these lies and schemes and lawsuits to get back to the White House, and Obama just strolls right in there.” Obama stopped by to celebrate the 12th anniversary of Obamacare, “and also to help Joe set up his Roku”, Kimmel quipped. The former president/vice-president duo “managed to strike just exactly the right balance of affection and confusion”, Kimmel continued, cueing up a clip of Obama’s speech in which he referred to Biden as “vice-president”. “It was like the White Men Can’t Jump reunion at the Oscars,” Kimmel joked. In other news, conservatives have called for Elon Musk, who bought 9.2% of Twitter for $2.9bn this week and joined its board of directors, to reinstate Donald Trump’s account. The move would be “unnecessary”, said Kimmel, “because Trump has his own super successful media platform”. That would be the much-beleaguered app Truth Social, which is “to Twitter what a broken Sega Genesis is to TikTok”, Kimmel explained. Though the platform launched in February, many users still can’t get on it. “It’s basically an inactive AOL message board right now,” Kimmel said. On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert also commented on Obama’s first visit to the White House in five years. “He was there to promote Obamacare and to get that pack of smokes he forgot in the Lincoln bedroom,” the host joked. As for Obama opening his speech by calling Biden “vice-president”, which he quickly called a joke – “it’s funny,” said Colbert. Although “I’m not sure if I buy that was a joke. I think he went up there and the first thing he said was a gaffe – he and Biden have more in common than we thought.” Obama was ostensibly visiting to celebrate Biden’s signing of an executive order to expand coverage under the Affordable Care Act, but there’s speculation that the visit was intended as a boost for Democrats as Biden’s approval ratings slide. “OK, I understand that theory,” said Colbert, “but isn’t that like try to get the spark going with your wife by inviting her sexy old boyfriend that broke up with her at her anniversary dinner?” Colbert also touched on Disney’s public opposition to Florida’s so-called “don’t say gay” act, a “stupid and hateful” law, said Colbert, which bans classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity from kindergarten through third grade. “So in response, Florida Republicans have put Disney in their sights like it was Bambi’s mom,” said Colbert. One representative threatened to take away Disney’s special tax privileges as well as the company’s ability to “act with the same authority and responsibility as a county government”. “Now, wait a second. Disney has to have the same authority as a government,” Colbert deadpanned. “How else can they arrest and jail the little-known eighth dwarf, Stabby? It’s Florida. You know there’s a Stabby. “Republicans say they’re against cancel culture,” he added, “but now they’re trying to cancel what they call a ‘woke company’ whose core message, I will remind you, is ‘it’s OK to kiss women while they’re in a drug-induced stupor.’”",Arts/Culture,Jimmy Kimmel on Obama at the White House: ‘To help Joe set up his Roku’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/06/jimmy-kimmel-obama-white-house-stephen-colbert
4/7/2022,"The House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol has received a cache of emails belonging to Donald Trump’s lawyer, John Eastman, federal court documents filed on Tuesday show. The 101 emails were released to the committee after Judge David Carter ruled in federal court in California last week that Eastman, a hard-right supporter of the former US president, had not made a sufficient claim to attorney-client privilege. The cache of documents, sent between 4 and 7 January 2021, contains extensive communications between Eastman and others about plans to obstruct the certification of Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election. These included proposed efforts to push Trump’s former vice-president, Mike Pence, to reject or delay counting electoral college votes and weaponizing false allegations of voter fraud in numerous state lawsuits. In one email, which includes a draft memo for Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, recommending Pence reject some states’ electors during the 6 January congressional meeting, Carter ruled for disclosure as the communications were being used to plan criminal activity. “The draft memo pushed a strategy that knowingly violated the Electoral Count Act, and Dr Eastman’s later memos closely track its analysis and proposal,” the ruling says. “The memo is both intimately related to and clearly advanced the plan to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021.” Neither Trump nor Eastman have been charged with crimes relating to 6 January and the order on Eastman’s emails was made in civil court. Others references to emails in the judge’s ruling allude to other plans Eastman was involved in. “In a different email thread,” Carter writes, “Dr Eastman and a colleague consider how to use a state court ruling to justify Vice-President Pence enacting the plan. In another email, a colleague focuses on the ‘plan of action’ after the January 6 attacks, not mentioning future litigation.” The sprawling select committee investigation, chaired by the Democratic congressman Bennie Thompson from Mississippi, has interviewed more than 800 people as part of its investigation into the events on January 6. On Tuesday, Thompson confirmed that Ivanka Trump, the former president’s daughter, had appeared before the committee, marking the first time a member of the immediate Trump family had appeared. Reports indicated her testimony lasted about eight hours. The testimony followed an appearance before the committee by her husband, Jared Kushner, the previous week.",News/US news,"Trump lawyer discussed plans to block Biden victory, emails reveal",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/06/trump-lawyer-emails-released-january-6-panel-discuss-plans-block-biden-victory
4/7/2022,"Sport is often held up as the world’s sole bastion of meritocracy, and with fair reason: how good at it you are is right there for everyone to see, your performances visible to the world and your quality not a matter of opinion but a matter of fact, described by simple, infallible metrics. And then you consider Frank Lampard’s managerial career – a more egregious example of privilege you could not wish to see, as Barry Davies might’ve put it. Lampard is no stranger to such accusations, and not just because he’s a privately educated, Trump-appreciating Tory – when he was 17, Harry Redknapp was publicly harangued, in front of him, for preferring his nephew to Scott Canham. Yes, that’s the Scott Canham. In fairness to Lampard, he turned out to be a useful player – useful enough and conventional enough to be handed a managerial job he’d done little to earn other than be good at football. Then, after dragging Derby all the way from sixth to sixth, he was appointed by Chelsea, inspiring them from the depths of third to the heady heights of fourth, before being dismissed midway through his second season. If any club was going to be compelled by this litany of triumph, Everton were going to be compelled by this litany of triumph, and they duly installed Lampard before handing him a decent January wedge to help stave off relegation. Two months later, they sit fourth-bottom of the table having lost five of their last six league games, and tonight visit third-bottom Burnley for what promises to be a match of devastating incompetence – The Fiver cannot wait. One thing The Fiver has always wondered, though, is how Lampard responded when Chelsea became Big Cup champions just months after he left: did he think ‘lucky they fired me’, ‘up the Chels’; or did he think ‘disgrace they fired me’, ‘I was right all along’? Which effortless segue takes us to tonight’s Big Cup fixtures – yes, after doing its research, The Fiver has ascertained that the competition is not comprised solely of Liverpool and Manchester City. At Stamford Bridge, the team formerly known as Frank Lampard’s Chelsea entertain Real Madrid – who are somehow managed by Carlo Ancelotti. Though Madrid are poised to win La Liga, the king of success with other people’s teams has recently added a new wrinkle to his CV, his team’s clásico humiliation seeing them deposed as the best in Spain before they’ve even been anointed as such, and if that’s not worth a raised eyebrow, The Fiver doesn’t know what is. Also this evening Bayern Munich, the biggest threat to the dominance of “this league”, visit Villarreal who are, of course, managed by Unai Emery. Good enough to win Big Vase and reach the last eight of Big Cup, Emery was, of course, not good enough for “the Arsenal”, a point illustrated by Mikel Arteta’s imposing record of two top-eight teams beaten so far this season: West Ham and Spurs under Nuno. Maybe they should give Scotty Canham a go next.

4/7/2022,"The search for more silverware will only get harder for Liverpool from here on in, warned Jürgen Klopp in Lisbon, but it was with unmistakable and understandable relish that his thoughts turned to what might prove the first of three defining matches with Manchester City this season. Benfica went perfectly on Tuesday, the opening 25 minutes of the second half notwithstanding, in terms of a Champions League quarter-final first leg result away from home, preparation for a potentially decisive moment in the Premier League title race on Sunday, and beyond. Liverpool will arrive at the Etihad Stadium with another slice of club history to their name. The 3-1 win at Estadio da Luz was their eighth consecutive victory on the road in all competitions, a new Liverpool record, and while Klopp spoke of his team “really digging deep and fighting with all they have” to extend the sequence in Portugal, overall it was Liverpool’s most commanding performance for several weeks. That is not to suggest City will be anywhere near as compliant as Benfica were in an almost one-sided first half, however. Klopp utilised and rotated his rich resources to telling effect once again. Jordan Henderson, Joël Matip, Roberto Firmino and Diogo Jota started on the bench – only Matip remained there throughout – ahead of the City game when all will be in contention to return. Trent Alexander-Arnold was given a valuable 89 minutes to rediscover his rhythm and truly outstanding passing range after a hamstring injury, likewise Naby Keïta, who offered creativity, bite and threat from midfield, following his recovery from a knee problem. For the second Champions League away game in succession it was a triple substitution – and not the quintuple – that enabled Liverpool to stifle an opponent in the ascendency around the hour mark. As at Inter, when Henderson, Keita and Luis Díaz were introduced with the hosts increasingly dangerous, it was circumstances on the night rather than with a mind on the next game that prompted Klopp to withdraw Thiago Alcântara, Sadio Mané and Mohamed Salah in the 61st minute against Benfica. But they should all feel the benefit. Afterwards the Liverpool manager again mentioned the strains – mental and physical – that Mané and Salah have been under of late. The time is clearly approaching for the strikers to be given a break having carried the burden of expectation in Senegal’s and Egypt’s run to the Africa Cup of Nations final, and again in the recent World Cup play-offs, with Salah suffering deflating defeat in both. Liverpool’s leading marksman has scored once in his last nine outings for club and country, a penalty at Brighton, and will view City as the perfect occasion to respond. The comfort of the two-goal lead in a Champions League quarter-final, and Liverpool’s evident superiority over Benfica for most of the night, offers Klopp an opportunity in the second leg to rest Salah before the FA Cup semi-final against Pep Guardiola’s team three days later. Klopp will admonish any talk that could be construed as complacency, as he did in the aftermath of Tuesday’s win, but the task confronting Liverpool next week is certainly less taxing than what faces City on their travels to Atlético Madrid. The prospect of the Premier League and FA Cup rivals also meeting in the Champions League final will increase should both emerge unscathed. The Liverpool manager embraced what lies ahead before leaving Lisbon. “If we win against City, which is difficult enough, nobody would think ‘That’s it decided’ because of the quality of the opponent. We play now against the best team in the world, that’s how it is, but we will give it a try anyway. What we did in the last six, seven, eight months is create the basis, and a better basis you cannot create. We are in the quarter-final, the semi-final, but the further you go in competitions the harder it gets. That’s unfortunately the truth – you rarely reach a final and play against a team who you beat 8-0. That doesn’t happen. The Chelsea final was incredibly intense, two top-class sides and that is how all the games will be for us from now on. “We know it since late December. It was clear then that if we want to achieve something we better win all our games. This is not really likely but that’s why we take it game by game and then it’s maybe a little bit more possible, but it will be really tough. Everybody knows about the importance of the next game, but after this game there will be other games in other competitions but in the Premier League as well, so if you cannot be first you want to be second. If you are behind, you want to come closer, if you are close, you want to overtake. We will give it a proper try.”",Sport/Football,Klopp rotates his rich resources to set Liverpool on fine footing for City | Andy Hunter,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/06/klopp-rotates-his-rich-resources-to-set-liverpool-on-fine-footing-for-city
4/7/2022,"On my way to work early one morning, walking through St Peter’s Square in Manchester, I happened upon a couple of dozen blokes in hi-vis workwear standing in a big circle. At the centre stood a woman, presumably a physiotherapist of some kind, taking them through a series of warmup exercises. Arms windmilled, necks rotated, knees were hugged to chests. I filed this away as a very sweet sight and a fine but possibly rare example of a company doing the right thing by its manual workforce. Then, this week, I was filming something for the BBC’s Countryfile programme in west Cornwall. Driving to somewhere spectacular, I asked the runner, a young man who we’ll call Tam from Taunton, what other shows he had worked on in his career. I got one of the more interesting answers I’ve had to that question: he had spent three years working as a roofer. Like, I suspect, many of the thousands of media students who graduate every year, he was unable to find a job in television. He said he had done quite well at roofing, and enjoyed it. So why, I asked, did he stop? “It was seeing the other roofers, and brickies and scaffolders and whatever, who’d been doing it a long time, and the physical state they were in … I just thought that I don’t want to end up like that.” I thought of all the many athletes I’ve interviewed and spent time with – the footballers, rugby players, boxers and so on – who have talked about the long-term damage they do to their bodies in their line of work. I’m entirely respectful and sympathetic of their issues, but rarely have I considered the physical toll on the bodies of people doing manual work every day. And, unlike athletes, I doubt they have constant access to physios, masseurs, medics and so on – the support crews who help keep sportsmen and women from falling to pieces. Neither, I assume, do they make the kind of money that you need to pay for private physiotherapy; I doubt the NHS is equipped to be of much assistance. Unlike athletes who can take a rest, albeit reluctantly, I expect many manual workers have employers who don’t pay a lot of heed to aches and pains. And as for the self-employed, they’ll feel unable to afford to take a break anyway. I asked my man Tam, the roofer turned runner, if he had ever seen anyone on site doing any kind of stretching, warmup, warm-down or anything whatsoever to equip their bodies to deal with what they were putting them through. Tam just laughed, obviously. Kevin Lidlow is a chartered physiotherapist of 30 years standing who tells me he has seen the consequences of this neglect over and again. He talks about the “constitutional attrition” that eventually wears and tears workers’ bodies out. “We find that they just carry on working regardless. It tends to be when they stop – for good or just temporarily for some reason – that the problems they’ve stored up reveal themselves. At that point we can teach them what to do, or rather what they should have been doing, but by then it’s too late.” I had a quick internet search for “stretching exercises for manual workers”. There’s useful stuff on there but, as far as I could see, not a lot of it generated in the UK. Much of it comes from New Zealand, for some reason. I suspect that the smaller the building site, the less likely it is that health and safety rules will be strictly adhered to. But even on bigger, intensively managed projects, I wonder if it’s more about hard hats, safety boots and safe working practices aimed, sensibly, at reducing accidents rather than the long-term damage done to workers’ bodies everywhere.

4/7/2022,"The long list of cuts made to social security benefits in the years after the 2010 election were justified by one purpose: to save money. But one cut in particular was about much more than that. The introduction of a two-child cap on benefits meant that anyone with a larger family would have to manage without the support of child tax credit or universal credit for a third or subsequent children. “Quite simply, we have been encouraging working-age people to have children and not work, when we should be enabling working-age people to work and have children. So it’s time we asked some serious questions about the signals we send out through the benefits system,” David Cameron said of the policy in 2012. In other words, the supposed “generosity” of the benefit system encouraged families on a low income to have more children, knowing that they would receive financial support for each additional child. Claims that families were “milking” the system were common at the time. And so, when George Osborne announced the limit in 2015, he said that the aim was “to ensure that families in receipt of benefits faced the same financial choices about having children as those supporting themselves solely in work”. But our new research, funded by Nuffield and published today, on the fifth anniversary of the introduction of the limit, shows that this logic does not hold up. The two-child limit hasn’t discouraged poorer families from having children; it has simply made families poorer. Using government birth records, we investigated whether the two-child limit reduced fertility among families on benefits who already had two or more children, compared with those who were not directly affected by the policy. We found that the fertility impacts of the policy were remarkably small: a reduction in annual births of just under 6,000 a year (less than 1% of total births) and a reduction in the fertility rates of those affected of about 5%. We had expected larger effects: previous research showed that benefit increases during the 2000s had substantial positive effects on fertility (approximately three times larger than our estimates). Our research suggests that doing the reverse – cutting benefits – has a relatively small effect on fertility. Why? Lack of information is one reason. Qualitative research by our sister project Benefit Changes and Larger Families indicates that knowledge about the two-child limit among those affected by it is low. Half of participants were unaware of the policy before having their third child. This is hardly surprising: the benefits system is notoriously difficult to understand in the UK, even for experts. Laura, a mum of three from London, didn’t know about the two-child limit. She called up the Department for Work and Pensions after she gave birth and they told her she wouldn’t receive any support for her baby. “I was just so shocked,” she said. But another reason is more fundamental: the decision to have a child is a deeply personal one, and isn’t explained by financial constraints alone. Typically, people’s fertility preferences are relatively “sticky”. If your preferred number of children is two, you are unlikely to have a third child in order to receive more benefits: the cost of raising a child vastly outweighs any potential gain. In other words, increasing financial support may enable parents to have the children they already want, but decreasing it doesn’t necessarily prevent them from following through on decisions they have already made. This is particularly likely at a time of low fertility when, as now, on average people want more children than they have. So the two-child limit appears to be failing on its own terms: it isn’t really reducing fertility. In many ways that’s a good thing: attempting to curtail people’s fertility by punishing them for having more children is problematic for all sorts of ethical and economic reasons, particularly given the fact that fertility rates are already well below the level needed to sustain the population. But it is concerning from another crucial angle: child poverty. If you introduce a policy that cuts the benefits of low-income families with children – but doesn’t make them less likely to have kids – then, as a simple matter of arithmetic and logic, the result will be an increase in child poverty. And that’s precisely what is happening: child poverty among larger families (those with three or more children) has been rising sharply since 2013 and 2014. In fact, almost all of the recent rise in child poverty is explained by its growth among larger families. Our research suggests that the two-child limit will make things much worse. Already, 308,520 low-income families (with over 1 million children) are losing £55 a week a child due to this policy. We know that this is having dire consequences for children, who despite the best efforts of their parents often feel the effects of reductions in income. The evidence is clear: income and poverty have a direct causal effect on children’s development, educational attainment and health, and not just in the short term but over the entire life course. Restricting children’s benefits at two children also has worrying implications for our society. No other country in the world caps children’s benefits at the second child. What are we saying about children who, by biological accident, are born third in a family? Every child needs supporting – regardless of when they are born or how large their family is. It is about time the government recognised that.

The Myers are the well-to-do New York brood who collect around it to celebrate their father’s lifetime award for services to science. Professor Richard Myers (Robert Lindsay) was an IVF pioneer but now has Parkinson’s disease, and his job’s central metaphor – of creating new life – plays out in his family’s discussions around children, parents, legacies and inheritances. Siblings arrive, bicker, pick at old wounds, and occasionally bond. There is fine acting all round, not only from Lindsay as the “colossus” of a father now cared for by his third wife, Megan (Alexandra Gilbreath) but also his three children: the highly strung Dot (Lisa Dillon), the artist Thomas (Alex Waldmann) and his charismatic twin Anthony (Sam Marks). Their partners are added to the mix, as well as Dot’s daughter, Lily (Nancy Allsop) who has the autoimmune syndrome of the play’s title, which acts as kindling to the family conflagration. Except that fire does not come roaring to life, exactly. If Alexis Zegerman’s play aspires to follow in the tradition of dysfunctional American family dramas, it lacks the fire of Sam Shepard’s face-offs, the emotional depth of Tennessee Williams and the tragicomedy of Tracy Letts’s August: Osage County, similarly set around an unhappy family reunion. Under the direction of Roxana Silbert, scenes take place in different parts of the house and this builds a certain intimacy and tension, although the dramatic effects of their humdrum conversations never quite live up to the promise that lies in Lizzie Clachan’s dazzling design. There is testiness and shouting around the dining table but this is not savage or soul-baring enough to drive the stakes sufficiently high. If this is a consummately middle-class family, their fights are a little too bourgeois and the drama is simply not as febrile as it would like to be. The Myers, in fact, do not seem especially dysfunctional, the drama ultimately reinforcing the power of family love and warmth, even if it seeks to do the opposite. But it does have a soap opera quality which makes it easy to watch and some scenes come together with power: the moment Megan talks about her cracked hands, when she is really referring to an inner cracking up in her carer’s role; also when Dot speaks of the constant anxiety, and cost, of having an ill child. Lindsay is the wobbling modern-day King Lear who apportions his kingdom – this New York brownstone and other financial assets – to his squabbling wife and children, and his part carries the wittiest lines as well as pathos. Even though the production feels too long, at well over two hours, with rambling dialogue, not enough action or big enough conflict, there is ambition in the writing that must be admired.

4/7/2022,"Sri Lanka is facing the imminent threat of starvation for its population of 22 million as the economic crisis in the country continues to worsen and food becomes increasingly scarce, a senior politician has warned. Speaking in a debate in parliament, held against the backdrop of the worst financial crisis to hit the country since independence – and with anti-government protests spreading across the country – the speaker of the parliament, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana, warned that this was “just the beginning”. “The food, gas and electricity shortages will get worse. There will be very acute food shortages and starvation,” Abeywardana told the legislature. The economic meltdown in Sri Lanka spiralled on Wednesday as the Sri Lankan rupee plunged to become the world’s worst-performing currency. Sovereign dollar bonds dropped to trade at deeply distressed levels, while the stock market fell a further 2%. Over the past few months, Sri Lanka has been facing a dire financial crisis on multiple fronts, triggered partially by the impact of Covid-19, which battered the economy, as well as mounting foreign debts, rising inflation and economic mismanagement by the government, led by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The country barely has any foreign currency reserves left, leading to dangerous shortages of food, gas and medicines as it is unable to import foreign goods, while people are enduring power blackouts of up to eight hours a day. The situation has pushed thousands out onto the streets in protest in recent days, calling for the resignation of the president. Protestors have been hit with teargas and water cannon in some instances and dozens have been arrested, but it has done nothing to prevent citizens from across all generations and walks of life turning out on the streets. Among them, in the commercial capital of Colombo, were hundreds of Catholic nuns and priests. “Our corrupt leaders must be sensitive to the cry of the people,” said Father Cecil Joy Perera at a rally. Swathes of doctors also joined the protests, urging the government to recognise that the country was facing a medical emergency over the lack of drugs and medical equipment. Despite the rising public anger and calls for him to resign, even by former members of his own ruling coalition who resigned en masse on Tuesday, Rajapaksa made it clear he had no intention of stepping down and has insisted the crisis is not his fault but instead due to global factors beyond his control. Speaking in parliament, the chief government whip, Johnston Fernando, said: “May I remind you that 6.9 million people voted for the president. As a government, we are clearly saying the president will not resign under any circumstances. We will face this.” Many have come to see the protests as the beginnings of a people-led revolution on Sri Lanka’s streets, demanding a complete regime change and economic emancipation for the country. Only a few months ago, such a challenge to the Rajapaksa regime would have been unthinkable, with the strongman president seen to hold mass support among the Singhalese Buddhist majority. Since he was elected, Rajapaksa, who hails from Sri Lanka’s most powerful political dynasty, has worked to concentrate power in the hands of himself and his relatives. His brother, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, was elected prime minister, while five other family members were given senior posts, including Basil Rajapaksa who was made finance minister, Chamal Rajapaksa, made irrigation minister, and his nephew Namal Rajapaksa, appointed sports minister. However, the slogans “Gota must go” and ‘“Gota go home”, calling for Rajapaksa to resign, have become a clarion call at the protests across the country and the president now finds himself with a minority in parliament after 41 members of his ruling coalition quit and said they would be independent legislators. Rajapaksa avoided a humiliating defeat in parliament on Wednesday by revoking the state of emergency, meaning no vote would be held by the legislature on the move, but his government remains in political limbo as the opposition has refused his request to join the government and he could face a vote of no confidence. The situation also prompted a statement by the UN human rights office (OHCHR) expressing concern over the deepening economic crisis in Sri Lanka and urging the government to defuse tensions peacefully.",News/World news,"Sri Lanka facing imminent threat of starvation, senior politician warns",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/sri-lanka-facing-imminent-threat-of-starvation-senior-politician-warns
4/7/2022,"When Irina Gen, a 55-year-old English and German language teacher in the Russian city of Penza, embarked on an anti-war speech in her classroom, little did she know she was being recorded by her own students. “I just wanted to broaden my students’ worldview. I hoped to break through the propaganda that is being fed to this country. But look where it got me,” said Gen, who faces a long-term prison sentence for “discrediting” the Russian army after her message went viral. On 18 March, Gen’s 13- and 14-year-old students asked her why Russian athletes were banned from participating in international competitions – a decision by the west that she said she tried to put in context. “Until Russia starts to behave in a civilised manner, the non-admission of Russian athletes to competitions will continue forever … I think that is correct,” she said in the audio, which was first shared by Kremlin-linked Telegram channels. “Russia wanted to reach Kyiv and overthrow the government! Ukraine is, in fact, a sovereign state, there is a sovereign government … We are living in a totalitarian regime. Any dissent is considered a crime.” Gen also voiced her disapproval of the way Russian state media framed the bombing of a maternity hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol as a Ukrainian-style provocation. Five days after her anti-war remarks to students, she got a call from the local FSB branch telling her to come to their office, where she was informed security agencies had received the footage of her speaking out in class. “I was shocked. I had no idea I was being recorded,” Gen recalled. “I told the prosecutors that I wasn’t lying. That I was merely citing respected western outlets like AP and BBC, outlets that I believe are professional and objective in their reporting,” Gen said. “But, of course, that wasn’t really an argument they would accept.” At the end of last month, Russian prosecutors announced they had opened a criminal case against Gen under a recently introduced law that criminalises the spread of so-called fake news about the Russian army. Prosecutors specifically took issue with the statements Gen made about the Mariupol maternity ward. She has since been banned from leaving the country, and her lawyer said she faced up to 10 years in jail if found guilty. Russia has launched an unprecedented crackdown on anti-war sentiments and Gen’s case is one of at least four that are known about in which teachers who criticised the war were either fired or prosecuted after students complained about them to their parents and the authorities. “I am simply being prosecuted for a viewpoint that isn’t the official one. My family already went once through a denunciation campaign in the Soviet Union,” Gen said referring to Stalin’s great purge in which hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens denounced their neighbours, friends and relatives as “enemies of the state”. While she was “upset” to find out she was being recorded by the students she knew well, she did not hold a grudge against them. “I don’t blame my students; they just follow what their parents think and tell them to do,” said Gen, who has since left her teaching job. She believes one of the parents of her pupils encouraged their child to record her after Gen earlier made “small” anti-war remarks during class. “This situation is terrible. It has been very hard on me personally. But it’s also crazy to see how everyone around me, the vast majority of people that I know, people I considered friends, are supporting Russia in this conflict.” Six weeks into Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, polls indicate that the Kremlin, with the help of relentless state propaganda, has managed to mobilise popular support for its military actions. Moscow early on signalled it would not tolerate dissenting voices in its education sector. The country’s education minister, Sergey Kravtsov, openly described schools as vital to Russia’s fight to “win the information and psychological war” against the west. As of 1 March, schools introduced new lessons in which teachers were instructed to explain to their students why Russia was forced to start the war against “a fascist regime in Ukraine”. Hundreds of posts have also appeared on Russian social media featuring schoolchildren posing for pictures forming Z signs, the military marking that has become the main symbol of public support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Local kindergartens have even posted images of toddlers lying on a playmat in a Z formation and preschoolers painting their country’s military symbol in the colours of the Russian tricolour. Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Moscow Center said the experience of Gen and other teachers pointed to a worrying “Stalinisation” of Russian society. “It feels like we are in a time machine. A climate is created in which denunciations are encouraged by the authorities. We have seen the same processes develop under Stalin, which had devastating consequences,.” Kolesnikov said he had been approached by “many university professors” who said they were scared to mention the “Ukrainian subject”. “They say that students are trying to provoke them into speaking about the conflict just to denounce them.” Kolesnikov said if the current atmosphere in the country persisted, Russia “will soon have a new generation of Pavlik Morozov’s”, referring to the Soviet boy who denounced his father to the authorities and became a propaganda icon, with statues of him being raised all over Russia. Kolesnikov said the effects of the war frenzy would be felt far beyond the classrooms in the country. A number of reports have recently emerged of random passersby denouncing small business owners who put up anti-war messages in their shop windows. “We are seeing creeping signs of an authoritarian regime transforming into a full-on totalitarian one, in which a mobilised society actively tells on each other,” Kolesnikov said.",News/World news,Russian teacher ‘shocked’ as she faces jail over anti-war speech pupils taped,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/russian-teacher-shocked-as-she-faces-jail-over-anti-war-speech-pupils-taped
4/7/2022,"After Friday’s huge jump in energy costs, millions of people across the UK face a frightening future. Urgent measures are needed but, instead of taking action, the cabinet is absorbed in a pointless argument that wrongly pits the energy bill crisis against our climate commitments. In reality, the best way of bringing down bills is to get off gas for good. We can take immediate steps to stop using gas because the UK has clean energy sources that can get going quickly, and are cheap and popular – wind and solar in particular. But at a time when they should be powering up the UK with renewables, ministers have other ideas: suggesting deepening our reliance on fossils fuels by opening up more drilling in the UK; or labouring under the misapprehension that people would rather live near a nuclear power plant than a wind turbine. The government’s tug of war over onshore wind is particularly puzzling. Onshore wind is clean, cheap and extremely popular, with the government’s own polling showing support from four out of five people in the UK. Far from considering them an “eyesore” as some Tory MPs and ministers worry, a Survation poll last year found that people who live near existing windfarms are the most supportive of all. Yet a major cause of the past month’s delay in getting the energy strategy out appears to be the government’s utterly unfounded concern that people don’t like onshore wind, and their mistaken belief that removing the virtual ban on new wind projects in England would provoke huge resistance from Conservative voters. The government removed support for onshore wind in 2015 following pressure from a group of Conservative MPs, some of whom have since changed their minds, left parliament or moved on to other pet peeves. The dislike for visible renewable energy projects from a fraction of the Conservative backbenches has always been out of step with public opinion, which has been consistently behind renewable energy, including onshore wind. Even a decade ago, two-thirds of people supported onshore wind, with support steadily rising to the 80% at which it currently stands. The British public know that clean energy is the way out of this crisis but, as they watch their energy bills shoot up and face the dismal prospect of cold homes, all they can see is their government dithering and delaying on the clean energy sources that are the quickest and easiest solution. Instead of fixing this crisis with renewable energy, ministers are reportedly thinking of pursuing nuclear power. Ministers recently tried and failed to argue that onshore wind is too expensive, yet they seem quite happy to argue for bill payers to shoulder the cost of nuclear power, which is about twice as high per unit of electricity as onshore wind. Given the urgency with which we need to clean up our energy supply and cut energy bills, the sluggish timeframes for new nuclear power projects risk leaving people at the mercy of gas markets for far too long. Wind projects commissioned now can be up and running before the end of next year, while the most recent nuclear projects, announced in 2010, won’t produce any energy until 2026 at the earliest. It is hardly surprising that nuclear power is much less popular than onshore wind, with just a third of people thinking that nuclear power would be affordable and even fewer thinking it is safe. If the government believes that new nuclear plants will be an easier sell to people than onshore wind on cost or local impacts, they could be in for an unpleasant shock. Ministers who insist that the UK’s energy strategy must prioritise community consent are right. Now they must also recognise that any plan to rush forward with an unpopular, slow and expensive energy source, while keeping the brakes on clean, cheap and quick onshore wind, is unlikely to gain support. It is time for the government to start listening to what people actually want, which is appropriately placed renewable energy projects that support local people and the local environment and for communities to have a say on the infrastructure in their area. The energy strategy is a vital chance to make this a reality. If the government gets this wrong, we’ll be living in cold homes on a hot planet. If they get it right, this could be the last energy crisis we ever have.
