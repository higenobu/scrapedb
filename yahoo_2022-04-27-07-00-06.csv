4/27/2022,"A psychologist hired by Amber Heard testified on behalf of Johnny Depp in his defamation trial. She said Heard ""was grossly exaggerating"" PTSD symptoms and downplayed Heard's personal issues. Heard had disorders associated with violence toward romantic partners, the psychologist said. A forensic clinical psychologist who evaluated Amber Heard testified in court Tuesday that she diagnosed the actor with borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder. The scores Heard received on professional psychological tests were associated with people who were ""full of rage"" and ""socially sophisticated,"" Shannon Curry, the psychologist, said. ""These people might have that anger kind of explode out at times,"" Curry said. ""They tend to be very passive-aggressive. They may be self-indulgent, very self-centered. They could use manipulation tactics to try to get their needs met. They're very needy of attention, acceptance, approval."" Curry was called to the witness stand by lawyers for Johnny Depp, who is suing Heard. He alleges Heard defamed him when she described herself as a victim of domestic violence in 2018 — a characterization that Depp denies. His lawsuit also alleges that Heard physically and verbally abused him throughout their relationship until their 2016 divorce. Heard has doubled down on her allegations with a countersuit. The clinical psychologist testified that she was hired by Heard's lawyers to evaluate whether Heard had post-traumatic stress disorder following her relationship with Depp. Curry evaluated Heard for 12 hours in December over two days and analyzed earlier treatment records, recordings, and other documentation her lawyers provided, she said. Curry said Heard ""did not have PTSD"" and appeared to be ""grossly exaggerating"" symptoms. ""She initially said, 'Yes, I have 19 of the 20 symptoms.' That's not typical, even of somebody with the most disabling form of PTSD,"" Curry said on the stand in the Fairfax, Virginia, courthouse where the trial is taking place. ""When we eventually sort of dialed it down, there were three remaining symptoms."" She diagnosed Heard with other psychological disorders. ""The results of Ms. Heard's evaluation supported two diagnoses: borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder,"" Curry said. The evaluations, Curry said, involved looking into Heard's home life, her relationship with her family — which Heard has said involved abuse — school life, friendships, career history, and other personal relationships. Among the tests she used was the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, commonly known as the MMPI-2, which is used to diagnose personality disorders. Curry said she prepared a 25-page interpretation following the test. She concluded that Heard had ""a very sophisticated way of minimizing any personal problems,"" while having ""a lot of inner hostility"" and externalizing blame. Borderline personality disorder, Curry said, is a disorder of ""instability"" in personal relationships, emotions, and a person's sense of self. A driving factor, she said, is the ""underlying terror of abandonment."" ""When somebody is afraid of being abandoned by their partner or by anybody else in their environment, and they have this disorder, they'll make desperate attempts to prevent that from happening,"" Curry said. ""And those desperate attempts could be physical aggression."" She added that borderline personality disorder was ""a predictive factor for women who implement violence against their partner."" ""If their partner wants to get space from all of this intense emotion, oftentimes, they will be abusive to their partners in these situations,"" Curry said. ""Sometimes, they'll physically restrain them from leaving and become injured that way."" People with the disorder can express ""explosive anger"" as a result of perceived slights, Curry said, in a way that can be ""exhausting for their partners."" ""Oftentimes, their partners will try to make them happy at first and really allow themselves to be a punching bag, thinking that they can somehow solve this problem, that somehow they can make this better,"" Curry said. ""And eventually, it just overwhelms them."" Curry's assessment resembles the testimony of Laurel Anderson, a therapist who oversaw marriage-counseling sessions with Depp and Heard. Anderson said earlier in the trial that Heard dominated conversations and had poor listening skills. Depp's relationship with Heard, Anderson said, triggered ""mutual abuse"" among the couple. Anderson added that Heard told her she ""escalated"" arguments to violence if she was afraid Depp would leave her. Other witnesses said they sometimes saw Heard physically cling to Depp when he tried to walk away from an argument. ""You're going to see a lot of this escalation in the bizarre behavior,"" Curry said on Tuesday. ""They can react violently. They can react aggressively. They will often physically prevent their partner from trying to leave."" Depp testified earlier in the trial that he planned to leave Heard, after years of constant fighting, following the death of his mother. Heard preempted that by filing a restraining order that included photos of her bruised face, in an incident she blamed on Depp but which Depp and his employees testified was fabricated. According to Curry, people with borderline personality disorder often ""make threats using the legal system"" when threatened with abandonment. ""They might say that they are going to file a restraining order or claim abuse, or they might do these things, to essentially try to keep their partner from leaving,"" Curry said. ""In the moment, they're not consciously thinking, 'I'm going to keep my partner from leaving right now.' They're just thinking, 'I can't stand this. I hate my partner.'"" Curry added: ""They went from idealizing to suddenly devaluing because of the hurt. And they'll do anything to express that big emotion of anger."" The psychologist also said Heard approached her evaluation in a way that downplayed her psychological issues. ""She approached it in a manner that very clearly minimized any psychological dysfunction. Not just that, but really presented herself as free of any problems,"" Curry said. ""And she did so in a way that was very sophisticated, not obvious, by responding to questions that most people might not notice are trying to detect that."" Heard's MMPI test produced a ""code type"" associated with ""cruelty,"" Curry said, as well as people who are ""very attention-seeking"" and ""prone to externalizing blame, to a point where it's unclear whether they can even admit to themselves that they do have responsibility."" Curry said the results demonstrated that Heard could see herself as an ""avenger against injustice"" without seeing her own faults. ""They have a capacity to kind of offer some of their faults but only the ones that people think of lightly and can all relate to,"" she said. ""And so they can present as very fair and balanced, but in actuality, they really might be very judgmental of others and unaware of problems in their behavior around their thinking."" Before Depp finished his testimony on Monday, he said on the stand that Heard was jealous of his friendship with Paul Bettany. The ""WandaVision"" actor was such a threat to Heard, Depp said, that she once drove Bettany's 18-year-old stepson to tears in an argument. People with histrionic personality disorder, Curry said, often want to be the center of attention even when they have little to say. When they see the attention of people around them waning, they may make up stories, Curry said. ""They might take the victim role or the princess role, and even make up stories,"" Curry said. ""Sometimes, those are to bolster the victim role. Sometimes, those stories are just to make them look more interesting or accomplished in their mind so that they can get respect and attention that way.""

4/27/2022,"In a statement released Sunday night from Remnant Fellowship Church, the church vowed it will continue its mission despite the deaths of its founder and some of its leaders. Gwen Shamblin Lara, the founder of the controversial church, is presumed dead after a plane carrying her and her husband, Joe, crashed into Percy Priest Lake in Smyrna on Saturday. On board the Cessna 500 series plane were other church leaders, including Lara's son-in-law Brandon Hannah, a Williamson County real estate agent who was married to her daughter Elizabeth. While mourning the great loss, the church called the faith leaders ""some of the finest and most loving people that you would ever come across."" Documentary series continues: 'The Way Down' follow up explores Gwen Shamblin plane crash and aftermath Percy Priest crash: What to know about the deadly accident that killed Christian diet guru Gwen Shamblin Lara Percy Priest plane crash: Gwen Shamblin Lara, other leaders of controversial church presumed dead after plane crash The statement also said Lara's children, Michael Shamblin and Elizabeth Shamblin Hannah, ""intend to continue the dream that Gwen Shamblin Lara had of helping people find a relationship with God."" Lara founded the church after the success of her weight-loss Bible study program called ""Weigh Down Workshop."" She linked weight loss to her faith and gained an international following. She was born and raised in Memphis, and received her master's degree in food and nutrition from the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. Early in her career, she worked as an instructor at the University of Memphis and for the city's health department. Couples Jennifer and David Martin and Jessica and Jonathan Walters are also presumed dead. The couples were part of the church leadership and both credited Lara for rejuvenating and strengthening their faith. The Martin couple was founding members of the church and joined in 1999. All victims leave behind families and children. The church said it will take special care of the children in the coming years. ""Gwen Shamblin Lara was one of the world’s most kind, gentle, and selfless mother and wife, and a loyal, caring, supportive best friend to all,"" the church said in its statement. ""She lived every day laying down her own life to ensure that others could find a relationship with God. ""Because of that, her memory will definitely remain for a long time as she has a place in millions of people’s hearts around the world through her work with Weigh Down Ministries and Remnant Fellowship Church. Her wonderful and supportive husband, Joe Lara, will also be greatly missed."" Elizabeth Shamblin Hannah submitted a statement delivered by Rutherford County spokeswoman Ashley McDonald at a news conference Sunday. ""The seven Remnant Fellowship leaders lost yesterday including my husband and my mother were some of the finest, most righteous and loving people I have ever known,"" her statement said. ""Her message of loving God with all of your heart will live on forever and ever and continue to change lives for all eternity."" She described her husband as ""one of the most selfless and loving spouses and fathers on the planet"" who put God first. The two wed in 2003 and have four children. They oversaw the church's youth ministry program. ""These amazing seven leaders will go down in history as some of the finest Christians anyone will ever meet,"" she said. Michael Shamblin said in a statement his mother positively impacted millions of people around the world. ""My family is asking for prayers at this time, and we hope everyone who was affected, especially the children of the passengers, know they are very loved, and we will take care of their needs in the upcoming years,"" he said. ""Joe Lara was such a wonderful husband to my mother and he will be missed."" Jennifer and David Martin's family members, including daughter Ashton Martin Jost and Jennifer Martin's mother, Diane McCord, expressed their gratitude to investigators and authorities in a statement delivered by McDonald. The Martins had five children and joined the church in 1999 after first meeting Gwen Shamblin Lara in the Weigh Down Workshop. On the church's website, the couple said they were raised to be lackadaisical Christians, but through Lara's mentoring they discovered the importance of more deeply honoring their faith. Jessica and Jonathan Walters were married in the church in 2002 and had three children. Like the Martins, the Walters on the church's website credited Lara for their faith and strong marriage. Investigators had changed from a rescue mission on Saturday to a recovery mission Sunday. According to the Federal Aviation Administration website, no one on the flight was qualified to fly the plane. Joe Lara, 58, had a pilot's license but had not updated his medical certification since 2017. The medical certification is required every two years. Brandon Hannah didn't have a certification for the plane, according to the FAA database. The Laras took off Saturday morning from the Smyrna Rutherford County Airport. A recording of the communication between the control tower and the pilot, captured on LiveATC.net, revealed an alarm going off in the cockpit of the plane seconds before it crashed, suggesting a mechanical failure in the aircraft, which was built in 1982. Debris from the shattered plane scattered across about a half mile of the lake, according to Rutherford County Fire Captain and Incident Commander John Ingle. Dive teams from local emergency agencies found human remains among the wreckage Sunday as the recovery effort continued. The Remnant Fellowship Church, founded in 1999, reportedly has more than 1,500 members in 150 congregations around the world. According to its website, the church is ""an international community of people who are finding renewed hope, profound love and deep purpose by putting the undiluted teachings of Jesus Christ into practice."" ""This Church has its roots founded in the Bible-based teachings of Gwen Shamblin through Weigh Down Ministries, who has a 30-plus years long-and-counting track record of helping people change their lives in every positive and productive way,"" the website says. The Remnant Fellowship website lists food ahead of drugs, depression, self focus, money, anger, selfishness, envy and jealousy as the idols that need to be ""laid down.""

4/27/2022,"Scientists have confirmed a link between drug-resistant fungi in the environment and in human lungs. Environmental mold can cause lung infections in people with vulnerable immune systems. Some molds have evolved drug resistance from agricultural exposures, making fungal infections more difficult to treat. Researchers at Imperial College London have confirmed that drug-resistant mold infections originating from gardens, homes, and farms are causing persistent, life-threatening illness in humans. Molds like Aspergillus fumigatus are ubiquitous around the world, so the average person's immune system is skilled at recognizing and clearing inhaled mold spores. However, drug-resistant mold strains are on the rise worldwide, and the Imperial study, published Monday in the journal Nature Epidemiology, identifies a likely driving factor: exposure to agricultural fungicides. While a hefty dose of fungicide will kill a mold like Aspergillus, gradual exposure in the environment can lead the way to drug resistance, Johanna Rhodes, a genomic epidemiology fellow at Imperial, told Insider. ""It's kind of like building up a tan gradually,"" Rhodes, the study's lead author, said. ""If it's exposed a little bit at a time, it will develop the resistance slowly."" The study is one of the first to confirm that people can catch drug-resistant fungal infections from their everyday environments. To interrogate the connection, Rhodes and her team collected and analyzed more than 100 Aspergillus samples from infected patients across England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland between 2005 and 2017. They also sequenced mold samples from those patients' environments and compared them for matches. For some patients, samples of Aspergillus taken from the lungs were nearly identical to spores found in nearby soil or other environmental sources, picked based on hospital location. In six separate cases, drug-resistant aspergillosis infections could be traced back to the patient's environment with high confidence. Researchers like Rhodes are especially interested in tracking drug-resistant mold strains, which are on the rise worldwide. Infections with normal Aspergillus sicken 10-20 million people around the world, according to estimates cited in the study. The infection is typically treated with a class of antifungal drugs called azoles, but emerging drug resistance is a growing threat. Almost half of the samples collected in the UK-based study were resistant to at least one first-line antifungal drug, and more than 10% of samples (including three from patients) had evolved resistance to two or more azole drugs. Although drug resistance can emerge during treatment in hospital settings, the authors concluded that the fungi in question developed resistance before it infiltrated any human lungs, and that pointed them to agricultural fungicides. Antifungal resistance can be deadly for patients with compromised immune systems, whether they're on immunosuppressant medications or managing an autoimmune condition. Studies have found a 25% increase in mortality three months into infection with drug-resistant Aspergillus compared to those with typical, treatable fungal infections. Like many fungi, Aspergillus thrives in decaying environments. Soil beds, compost bins, and decaying wood are plenty hospitable for fungal growth, and mold spores can become airborne and spread to new environments. Drug-resistant Aspergillus is virtually everywhere, Rhodes said, because spores can move through the air and transfer genetic material to wild Aspergillus colonies that have never encountered azoles. As the risk of exposure is so widespread, the authors are calling for improved surveillance of drug-resistant strains of fungus. While the average person can't sequence mold spores from their backyard, Rhodes recommended leaving windows open to prevent a buildup of Aspergillus in the home, as well as to clear out other pathogens like the coronavirus. N95 face masks acquired during the COVID-19 pandemic can also work for avoiding spore inhalation while gardening or handling compost.
