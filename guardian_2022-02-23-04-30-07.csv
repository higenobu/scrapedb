2/23/2022,"Weren’t stock markets meant to plunge when Russian troops were ordered over the border into Ukraine? Well, the FTSE 100 index opened 100 points lower, which fitted the script, but it quickly rebounded and spent most of the day in positive territory. It closed up 10 points: basically flat. It was a reminder, for the umpteenth time, that stock markets are a reliably unreliable guide to geopolitics. As the fund manager Terry Smith points out often, trying to time macro events is virtually impossible since you need to know what the market was expecting and how it will react, and neither task is straightforward. Brexit and the election of President Trump were meant to shatter stock markets if they happened: share prices soared when they did.  That said, Tuesday’s mild market reaction to President Putin’s action looks little more than a holding position. The relative calm surely won’t last if Russian troops drive further into Ukraine, presumably triggering more than the “pretty tepid” sanctions, as Bill Browder, former investor in Russia and campaigner for global anti-corruption laws, described the UK response. One suspects stock markets will take their cue from energy markets in coming days and weeks. Oil briefly touched $100 a barrel on Tuesday, the highest for seven years and a price that will eat into global growth if sustained for long. Natural gas rose as Germany halted certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and conceded, in effect, that it needs to rethink its new energy policy. The fund manager Amundi’s analysts noted semi-optimistically that the Soviet Union and Europe maintained commercial relations on energy supply even at the height of the cold war and that it is therefore “premature” to talk about an energy crisis in the EU. Yes, that assumption, which is still the market’s base case, is currently reasonable. That doesn’t mean it is guaranteed to be correct. It was polite, or canny, on the part of the big insurers to play along with the government’s spin that reform of the EU-focused Solvency II regulatory regime represents a “Brexit dividend” or a “bonfire of red-tape”. The reality is that the EU is also in reforming mode to unlock capital on insurers’ balance sheets and can be put to more useful work than sitting on piles of government IOUs. Indeed, Brussels was quicker to signal its own bonfire: its review of the rules was announced last September. Never mind the political point-scoring, though. Reform is welcome. In this technical field of “matching adjustments” and “solvency capital requirements”, a good illustration of the perverse incentives created by Solvency II was offered by the insurers’ trade body, the ABI. It calculated that this is currently much easier for a pension fund managed by an insurer “to invest in a highly rated mining company that it is to invest for 30 years in a windfarm”. It is hard to fathom how such an outcome is supposed to protect policyholders. Solvency II, which has good points, got lost in a few thickets. We have yet to see how much of the theoretical £95bn of extra investment in UK infrastructure materialises. At least part of the answer will depend on the input of the Bank of England, which presumably will be anxious to preserve a few safety-first features. But, yes, reform is a dry but important development that should boost long-term investment in the UK. Beecham – one of the names made redundant in the turn-of-the-century merger that created GlaxoSmithKline – seemed a decent ancient brand to revive for the demerger of the group’s Sensodyne-to-Panadol consumer products division. Sadly, it’s not to be. The new £50bn-ish FTSE 100 company, arriving in the summer, will be called Haleon. It sounds vaguely like an inert gas, but, according to the official explanation, the name is a marriage of hale (as in hearty) and leon (associated with strength). If you insist. At least GSK has opted for something short and inoffensive and hasn’t tried to be whizzy and digitally enabled (chief culprit: abrdn, as Standard Life Aberdeen, bizarrely, is now known). The test is how soon the outside world will stop adding an explanatory “GSK’s former consumer division” on every mention. As with the spirits group Diageo, one suspects we’ll get used to this one reasonably quickly. It’ll do.",News/Business,Talk of an EU energy crisis is premature – but nothing is guaranteed | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/feb/22/talk-eu-energy-crisis-premature-nothing-guaranteed
2/23/2022,"After months of growing tensions, and massing troops at Ukraine’s borders, there is no doubting the gravity of this moment. The tremors are felt across Europe, which the repercussions of Russian aggression could shape for decades to come – in its east, especially, where other former Soviet republics watch anxiously, but most of all, of course, in Ukraine itself, where this is not about geopolitical struggle but the threat of a massive human disaster. Its neighbours are preparing for millions of refugees in the worst case; some Ukrainians are already fleeing, abroad or to the country’s west, though others have vowed to fight. Vladimir Putin’s recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine as independent states, and order to send in “peacekeepers”, is the culmination of events which began in 2014 when Russia fomented the separatist insurgency that created the two self-proclaimed republics. Since Russian personnel have long been believed to be involved, this could be seen as to some degree a formalisation of the status quo. But in recognising the separatists’ claims to parts of the Donbas region that they do not currently control, the Russian president has increased the prospects of his armed forces encroaching on other parts of Ukraine. On Tuesday he requested the Duma to authorise the use of troops abroad; his angry railing the previous day, and the size and location of the military buildup, already suggested actions on a much larger scale.  Besides making absurd claims of “genocide” by Ukraine, Mr Putin portrayed the country as a Russian invention with no historical right to exist and, chillingly, warned that if Kyiv did not stop the violence of which Moscow accuses it, “all responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodshed will be entirely on the conscience of the regime ruling on the territory of Ukraine”. The best way to solve the current crisis, he has argued, is for Kyiv to abandon its goal of joining Nato and declare its neutrality. The unspoken words: or else. He has laid out his deep frustration at the Soviet Union’s collapse and desire to reestablish Russian supremacy in the region. His anger at Nato expansion comes alongside contempt for a weakened west; Brexit, domestic political divisions, the rise of China and the hope of a second Trump presidency have all, surely, factored in. Yet as Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said, there is “no other way” than focusing on de-escalation efforts: restating the costs for Russia, and keeping the door open for diplomacy, however uninterested Mr Putin appears, and however unlikely it seems to succeed. His security council looked uncomfortable as members declared their backing for recognition – but they all took what was effectively a public oath of fealty. Western unity will be essential. Russia has foreign currency reserves, and is benefiting from high energy prices, while the west must decide how far it will go amid a cost of living crisis. Germany’s suspension of certification for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline was both striking and welcome. But the first Nord Stream pipeline already provides two-thirds of Germany’s imported energy, and the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, has declared that EU sanctions should not hit energy. Meanwhile, Britain’s sanctions are decidedly anaemic, despite Boris Johnson’s bluster, singling out five banks and three oligarchs whom the US targeted years ago: hardly the promised crackdown on kleptocracy, and weaker than the EU’s measures. Leaving further leverage is sensible, but a lacklustre response has even less chance of deterring Mr Putin if he is truly set upon a course that, as the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny warned, is likely to lead to the deaths of Russians as well as Ukrainians and cost his country dearly too.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Ukraine: the shadow of war looms larger | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/22/the-guardian-view-on-ukraine-the-shadow-of-war-looms-larger
2/23/2022,"There can be few people who don’t want to return to the happy-go-lucky days before Covid-19. It’s only human to hanker for a time when one could hug a friend or sit next to a stranger without fear of spreading a deadly disease. But the measured judgments of the government’s top scientists on Monday evening confirmed that going back to the norms of the pre-pandemic world remains some way off. Sir Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance warned that infection rates remain high; that there are still significant numbers of people in hospital with Covid; and that a viral resurgence could “lead to [more] hospitalisations than Omicron”. This makes Boris Johnson’s decision to end all remaining Covid restrictions in England, including the legal requirement to self-isolate, baffling. Also gone by Thursday will be the self-isolation support payments of £500 for those on low incomes, and routine contact tracing. Next week Covid tests will no longer be free for most people including, bizarrely, NHS staff – which will inevitably leave vulnerable patients worried about a risk to their health. While restrictions are being relaxed in other parts of Britain, they have not been as dramatically swept away as in England.  Mr Johnson’s decision is reckless. Ending self-isolation and testing will increase infections. Perhaps his gamble is that the effect will be so small that no one will notice. The government is not following the science, but its political instincts. Mr Johnson wants the support of a handful of Tory MPs amid the ongoing partygate scandal. In return for their votes, he is prepared to throw caution – and reason – to the wind. The moves are at odds with the public mood. For all the talk of restoring “freedoms”, polls indicate only 17% think people shouldn’t legally have to isolate. Mr Johnson’s claim that he is letting people exercise “personal responsibility” hides a policy where options are limited to those who have the means. Without proper support for isolation, many will go to work ill and spread Covid. The prime minister’s exhortation that British workers should imitate their German counterparts by staying at home when feeling unwell is undermined by the fact the UK has far lower levels of statutory sick pay. His claim that “anyone who wants to can buy a test” exposes an indifference towards people who cannot afford them. Mr Johnson’s message is that the pandemic is over and life can get back to normal. This is dangerous as it undercuts a public health message, when nearly a third of adults are unvaccinated. Covid is being checked but not eliminated. To help to keep the virus under control, it would be better to ease self-isolation at a slower pace and retain free tests. Mr Johnson frames this as being too expensive, a thinly veiled attempt to panic voters about the state of the public finances. For all the suffering, Covid also revealed new possibilities. The ability of the government to spend vast sums of money demonstrated the economic power it has to address a threat deemed serious enough. The pandemic functioned as an object lesson in what is possible. Maybe it was that hope Mr Johnson feared spreading – even more than the virus.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Boris Johnson’s Covid plan: political survival is its point | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/22/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnsons-covid-plan-political-survival-is-its-point
2/23/2022,"UK petrol prices are poised to hit a record 150p a litre later this week after the worsening tension in Ukraine added fresh pressure to the cost of living crisis facing households. Crude oil prices reached more than $99 a barrel at one point on Tuesday in response to Vladimir Putin’s decision to recognise the independence of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. Prices later slipped back after markets viewed the west’s initial sanctions response as weak.  But with Brent crude ending the day 1.6% higher at just under $97 a barrel, the RAC said motorists would quickly be paying 150p a litre for unleaded petrol and 154p a litre for diesel. Analysts said the cost of crude – already at its highest level in seven years – was soon likely to push through the $100-a-barrel level. Jeremy Nicholson, corporate affairs officer at Alfa Energy Group, said: “The deterioration of the situation in Ukraine and threat of military action by Russia is adding to the risk of disruption to European gas supplies, putting further pressure on UK/European wholesale gas and power prices. Oil prices are also being affected, with growing expectation oil could shortly reach or exceed $100 a barrel.” Germany’s decision to withhold approval of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline drew a swift response from Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president and now deputy chairman of its Security Council. “Welcome to the new world where Europeans will soon have to pay €2,000 () per thousand cubic metres!” he tweeted – suggesting prices were set to double. On a rollercoaster day, stock markets in Europe took their initial cue from Asia, which suffered big falls overnight after Russia sent troops into Donetsk and Luhansk. Share prices later recouped most of their losses in London, Frankfurt and Paris after the UK imposed sanctions on five of the smaller Russian banks and on three individuals already targeted by the US. But the risks of further turbulence on the global markets increased when the Nato secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the alliance believed Russia was planning a bigger assault on Ukraine. Western leaders in London, Washington and Brussels warned they would scale up their response if there was an intensification of Russia’s military action. Responding to all-party criticism, Britain said it would be scaling up its response while the EU and the US also pledged to put strong economic pressure on Moscow. The UK’s Centre for Economic and Business Research thinktank warned the crisis in Ukraine threatened to deliver a double blow of higher inflation and weaker growth. “Any international action will likely not only add to the current inflationary binge, possibly bringing inflation close to 10% in the main western economies, but also should slow down growth quite rapidly,” it said. The UK annual inflation rate – as measured by the consumer prices index – currently stands at 5.5% but is forecast by the Bank of England to rise above 7% by the spring. In London, the FTSE 100 index in London closed marginally higher at 7,495.97. Germany’s Dax lost 0.4% while France’s CAC slipped 0.16%, and Italy’s FTSE MiB and Spain’s Ibex were flat. Russian stock markets also staged a small comeback after earlier losses, with the dollar-denominated RTS index and the rouble-denominated Moex index on the Moscow exchange both rising 1.6% this afternoon. Shares in Russia’s largest lender Sberbank rose 1.3% (after an earlier gain of 5%) while the second-biggest bank VTB was up 1.7%, after they escaped British sanctions. Russ Mould, investment director at the investment firm AJ Bell, said: “Moscow’s RTS index was down 3% before Olaf Scholz and Mr Johnson made their statements – and it ended the day 1.6% higher. Major gainers included Gazprom, Norilsk Nickel, Tatneft and Rusal.”",News/Business,"UK petrol prices poised to hit record 150p a litre soon, warns RAC",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/uk-petrol-prices-poised-to-hit-record-150p-a-litre-soon-warns-rac
2/23/2022,"Athletes at the Commonwealth Games this year will be allowed to raise a fist on the podium to protest in favour of racial equality, and wave Pride flags in support of LGBT+ rights during victory laps, the Guardian has learned. The 4,500 athletes expected in Birmingham this summer will also be permitted to wear clothing, armbands and badges on the podium to support social justice causes under radical new “guiding principles” for athlete advocacy due to be announced on Tuesday.  But while the move will delight many athletes and human rights campaigners, insiders are also expecting a backlash from some commentators, who may try to rebrand the event as the “Common-woke Games”. The decision to allow athletes to raise a fist on the podium in support of Black Lives Matter is particularly evocative, as it will bring back memories of Mexico 1968, when Tommie Smith and John Carlos used a black power salute on the Olympic podium to protest against racial injustice in America. Within 48 hours of their protest both men were kicked out of those Games at the urging of the International Olympic Committee president, Avery Brundage – and, even now, the IOC forbids athletes from any kind of protest or demonstration on the podium, field of play, or during ceremonies. However senior figures at the Commonwealth Games Federation believe that a more enlightened policy is now needed. The hope is that by allowing more freedom of expression in Birmingham it will allow athletes to better become – in the words of one source – “agents for change in improving the world for the better”. It is also expected that the CGF will argue that strengthening athlete advocacy and activism humanises, rather than politicises, sport – a view very different to that taken by the IOC. Another notable change for Birmingham 2022 is that Aboriginal flags will be allowed on victory laps – a decision that stirs images of the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria when the Australian Cathy Freeman proudly held the flags of both her country and her people over her head, after winning the 400m. At the time such a celebration was not permitted and Freeman was publicly reprimanded by Australia’s chef de mission for the Games, Arthur Tunstall, who said: “She should have carried the Australian flag first up, and [we should have] not seen the Aboriginal flag at all.” Allowing Pride flags may also prove to be controversial in some nations given homosexuality is still illegal in 36 of the 72 countries that will compete in Birmingham. However the move is likely to be warmly endorsed by Tom Daley, who has regularly used his platform to suggest that the Commonwealth should be doing more to support LGBT rights. Speaking after winning gold at the 2018 Commonwealth Games on Australia’s Gold Coast – when homosexuality was illegal in 37 of the countries taking part – the British diver said: “You want to feel comfortable in who you are when you are standing on that diving board and for 37 Commonwealth countries that are here participating that is not the case. “I feel with the Commonwealth, we can really help push some of the other nations to relax their laws on anti-gay stuff.” Under the new guidelines athletes will be reminded that protests will be subject to the CGF ‘Charter of Good Conduct’ and must be done in “a tolerant and positive way”. Athletes will also be told that protests against a person, country or organisation – as well as actions such as defacing a national flag on the podium, hate speech, and making hand gestures affiliated with hate groups – are still forbidden.",Sport/Sport,Athletes permitted to protest on the podium at Commonwealth Games,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/22/athletes-permitted-to-protest-on-the-podium-at-commonwealth-games
2/23/2022,"Sarina Wiegman has urged England to be more “ruthless” in the final game of the Arnold Clark Cup against Germany on Wednesday. The Lionesses are second in the four-team friendly tournament, level on two points with Spain. Canada top the standings having beaten Germany after a 1-1 draw with England.  Wiegman brushed aside concerns about the team’s lack of goals from the front, with the centre-back Millie Bright’s volley England’s only goal of the competition, but she conceded they do need to be more clinical. “It doesn’t really matter who scored the goals as long as we score a goal,” the manager said. “We want to do better in the final third and that’s about decision-making, about connection, about scanning, the situation, and then being ruthless. “So yes, of course, we want to do a little better because we created lots of chances. We played really well, created those chances and now we want to score them too and that’s just the final touch, the hardest thing.” Germany are the highest-ranked team in the competition, at third in the world, but are missing key players, including Wolfsburg’s Almuth Schult, Svenja Huth and Alex Popp, Hoffenheim’s Tabea Waßmuth and OL Reign’s Dzsenifer Marozsán. “They still have a very strong squad,” Wiegman said. “They are always a very good team and even though they are missing very good players they still have very good players. We expect a good Germany, a very competitive game with a lot of speed and power, so we’ll be prepared like we were for Canada and Spain.” Wiegman rotated heavily between England’s 1-1 draw with Canada and 0-0 against Spain, making nine changes, and she confirmed that she would continue to experiment. “We want to continue what we were doing but make that even better against another good opponent again. We want to see some slight changes in positions.” Wiegman has been impressed with how the squad has held up against the toughest challenges faced during her tenure. “I’ve seen a lot from us and the team,” she said. “When I came in I knew the England squad was very good but it’s even better than I thought. The players already have so much experience and there are lots of personalities within the team. How we want to add some things, to get clarity about our style of play and development, is going really well.”",Sport/Football,England urged to be more ruthless by Sarina Wiegman before Germany clash,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/22/england-urged-to-be-more-ruthless-by-sarina-wiegman-before-germany-clash
2/23/2022,"The veteran Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov certainly had not been authorised to declare war on Ukraine in his daily press briefing on Tuesday, but he was coming perilously close to doing so anyway. He could not explain if Russia had recognised the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk up to their current borders, or with claims on further Ukrainian land. The answer could be the difference between a stalemate and a Russian war of conquest. And, not knowing that Vladimir Putin would weigh that evening to settle the question in favour of the expanded borders, Peskov was making a hash of it.  “Do these borders include Mariupol,” a journalist asked. “I have nothing to add,” replied Peskov, who had already delivered his one-line talking point: “Within the borders in which they exist and have been proclaimed.” “Meaning within the current borders?” another journalist ventured, hoping that the sixth question on the topic might lead to a breakthrough. “I have nothing to add to this,” Peskov replied. And on it went. Putin signed a presidential order to recognise the territories’ independence on Monday but it only became clear on Tuesday evening that Putin would back the territories’ claims to nearly three times the area currently under their control, making an offensive in east Ukraine a distinct possibility in the near future. For nearly a day, officials were treading water. A deputy prime minister said Russia had recognised the current borders where the states “operate and have jurisdiction.” An MP contradicted him, saying it should be the expanded borders, then contradicted himself, saying he was just expressing his personal opinion. It is possible that Putin only made up his mind later on Tuesday, after he gauged the reactions from the West to what some called his “re-invasion” of east Ukraine. Analysts who spent Tuesday waiting for Putin’s decision on the issue said that backing the territorial claims could “definitely mean a war.” “In Moscow, the open question is what particular borders they’re going to defend,” said Andrei Kortunov, the director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a thinktank, noting the territorial claims could be a justification for war. But while Putin could remain sphinx-like on the question for much of Tuesday, other officials were forced to run the gauntlet in public, stumbling over themselves to avoid making policy for the Kremlin. Denis Pushilin, the leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, went on state television late in the afternoon to discuss an official treaty he had just signed with Putin on friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance. “I want to get to the bottom of this question,” the anchor asked in an unusually insistent interview for Russian state TV. “When the agreement was signed between Russia and the [Donetsk People’s Republic], Russia took on an obligation to defend the borders of the republic in the whole Donetsk region, is that correct?” Pushilin sighed. He’d already dodged the question twice. “I’ll tell you that the question was not discussed,” he admitted a bit sheepishly. While normally you would expect a state signing a similar treaty to recognise the others’ territorial claims, he added: “We shouldn’t get ahead of ourselves.” When Putin finally chimed in later on, he made it sound as though the answer had always been obvious. “We have recognised the independence of these republics,” he said, noting that included their constitutions, which had the borders “within the Donetsk and Luhansk regions at the time when they were part of Ukraine.” The simple statement could have explosive consequences.",News/World news,Russia: day of dodging questions over Russian-controlled territories,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/russia-day-of-dodging-questions-over-russian-controlled-territories
2/23/2022,"Food producers have said the challenges they face are “the toughest in a generation” as members of the National Farmers’ Union met for their annual conference after the first full year of Brexit. Farmers from England and Wales gathered in Birmingham on Tuesday, against the backdrop of huge upheaval in agriculture, with labour shortages caused by Brexit and Covid, an ongoing pig cull and the transition to life beyond the EU’s subsidy scheme.  The day opened with a blistering attack on ministers from the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) president, Minette Batters, who accused the government of having no post-Brexit plan and of showing a “total lack of understanding of how food production works”. Her views were echoed by farmers speaking from the floor of the conference. Sam Godfrey, a pig farmer from Lincolnshire, said it was the “toughest time” he had known in 14 years on the family farm, while his father said he had not seen such challenging conditions since the 1970s. Godfrey, who has a herd of 6,500 sows, said pigs were still backing up on their farm, as abattoirs continued to take fewer animals to slaughter each week than planned. This is despite the family having invested £50,000 in converting buildings into extra space to house their pigs. “We have some spare capacity,” Godfrey said. “But we have never had a situation where it was this prolonged.” The NFU estimates that 200,000 pigs are backed up on farms in England, and are unable to be taken to slaughter as a result of labour shortages at abattoirs. Meanwhile, 40,000 healthy animals are thought to have been culled, and have not entered the food chain. Batters told the conference she had received a “heart-breaking” email from a family, who did not want to share their name, who had been producing pigs for more than 50 years. “They have taken the decision to cull 4,700 sows,” she said. Their son had hoped to enter the family business after completing an agriculture degree but had been forced to find another job. The government recently announced an immediate review of fairness in the pig industry supply chain and extended measures to support pig producers, including permitting foreign butchers to travel to the UK on temporary visas, longer working hours at processing plants and a scheme allowing producers to store carcasses for several months before processing. However, ministers have stopped short of providing financial support to affected pig farmers, in contrast with Scotland, Northern Ireland and some EU countries. One agricultural company, Thanet Earth, which grows tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers in glasshouses in Kent, said it had lost £320,000-worth of produce in 2021, when crops could not be picked at the right time to sell to its primary customers. “Some of it went to charity, but it hits us as a loss because it is a low-margin industry,” said Robert James, technical director of Thanet Earth. “The impact of not having access to labour.” Others warn that some smaller growers may leave the industry if they are unable to get enough workers to pick their crops. “We don’t know until we get into the summer whether we will get the workers we need,” said Philip Pearson, group development director at APS Produce, the UK’s largest tomato grower. The company requires 1,000 seasonal workers each year. “What this is going to mean is more imported food.” Producers say post-Brexit visa quotas are holding them back. The government has kept the number of seasonal worker permits at the 30,000 people allowed in 2021, resisting calls for a significant increase.",News/Business,Farmers in England and Wales ‘face toughest times in a generation’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/22/farmers-toughest-times-generation-england-wales-
2/23/2022,"Trapped in her home on the banks of the River Severn in Shrewsbury, Siobhan Connor said this was the 17th time she had been flooded in 14 years – and it was only becoming more frequent. “If you look at all the forecasts, this is going to become an annual or biannual occurrence,” Connor said from her first-floor window, as flood water filled the ground floor up to waist height. “We’ve had four major floods here in two years, and they’re now at record level.”  Residents of Shrewsbury said they were hit by the worst flooding in 20 years this week as they criticised authorities for decades of inaction. After being flooded for three consecutive years, many in the town said they feared the climate crisis was making major flood events more frequent while the government was doing little to help. “River levels today are close to the 2000 record, and 22 years later what have they done?” said Connor. Forecasters had anticipated that the river level at Welsh Bridge in Shrewsbury could surpass the record 5.25 metres measured in 2000, but at its peak on Tuesday morning it was just under at 5.15 metres. Despite having installed state-of-the-art flood defences and elevated her home, Connor feared the damage this time round would be extensive. “We’ll have to get in massive industrial dehumidifiers which will probably drain about 10 litres of water a day for at least a month. And we all know energy bills are going up in a couple of months. There’s so little government support, it’s expensive,” she said. She said it was a combination of housebuilding on floodplains and climate change that were pushing water levels ever higher, and felt action by the Environment Agency was ineffective. “There’s ways of mitigating flooding that could have been done with the right planning years ago. There’s nothing now we didn’t already know 20 years ago,” she said. Down the road, Louise Turner was helping to pump water out of the basement of her family’s business, the Abbots Mead hotel, which they have run since 1994. “I haven’t seen it this bad in years, since 2000 probably. This is horrendous this time. Surely it shouldn’t be happening in this day and age,” she said. “Usually it comes in a little bit, and our pumps kick in. This time the basement has flooded, including one of our family rooms, and the restaurant. It’s impossible to see the scale of the damage until it goes down, but it will be a lot.” She added: “It will be in the news for a couple of days and then people will forget about it until the next time round. It happens continuously. Something needs to change.” On Tuesday Shrewsbury’s Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski wrote to the prime minister asking him to visit the area to witness the “extent of the devastation … to homes and businesses”. Lezley Picton, the Conservative leader of Shropshire council, said local authorities were working extensively with the EA on solutions to stem the flow upstream, but admitted a quicker fix was needed. “We need short-term as well as long-term solutions, because businesses and people’s homes can’t go on like this. It’s heartbreaking, for some of the businesses this is the third time in three years they’ve flooded,” she said. “I’d like to see the government and the EA have some resolution to get this sorted sooner rather than later, because it’s not just us who are affected.” Downstream in Ironbridge, where the EA evacuated people from their homes and issued a severe threat to life flood warning, residents were preparing for the river to potentially overcome flood barriers on Tuesday evening. Peter Andrews, an ice-cream vendor, had decided to stay put in his cottage on the banks of the river and was relying on a water pump and thick metal boards to keep the waters at bay. “This is the third year running we’ve been flooded, so I’m getting used to it now. But prior to that it was around 2000 we had floods. It’s got to be down to global warming and all these freaky storms,” he said. “But what can you do? I would like to see more action to improve the situation, but I don’t know what the answer is.”",News/UK news,Shrewsbury residents frustrated as floods grow more frequent,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/22/shrewsbury-residents-frustrated-as-floods-grow-more-frequent
2/23/2022,"Well, blow me down with a feather duster. That’s basically what the government has announced today: we are going to blow Vladimir Putin down with a feather duster. These aren’t meaningful sanctions. They are the bare minimum of what we should have done weeks ago, when Putin first announced that he did not respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine. They are not a proper response to Putin’s declaration of independence for Donetsk and Luhansk and his sending in of troops. I don’t doubt that Putin is laughing his way to his dacha. His mocking sidekick Dmitry Medvedev said as much yesterday.  The Russian banks that Boris Johnson put on the sanctions list today aren’t the major players: they’re the spare change in the Russian economy. The three individuals he named have already been sanctioned in the US since 2018. So, we’re picking off the minnows but allowing the basking sharks to swim freely. Johnson didn’t even know whom we had already sanctioned, claiming that Roman Abramovich was on the list and refusing to correct the record when I asked him about it. Later in the day, his office had to own up that he was wrong. Is it too much to expect that a prime minister at a moment of international crisis would actually know some of the details? Johnson keeps on saying that we are going to have a public register of beneficial ownership of UK property, so that shell companies owning swaths of UK property can’t hide their oligarch owners. Yet the government has been promising this for years – and Companies House still doesn’t have the power or the resources to verify information registered with it, so it’s easy to lie with impunity. Johnson says they are closing the gold-plated tier 1 visa scheme for wealthy “investors”, but he still won’t tell us how many oligarchs were granted rights here without a proper examination of where their wealth came from. It’s difficult not to worry that the Russians who have given money to the Tories can have done so only because they were given UK nationality by the Tories. In any other country we would call that corruption. What angers me is that this is exactly what we did when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Some useful idiots then repeated the claims that Crimeans wanted to be part of Russia. Others said it was as much part of Russia as the Isle of Wight is British. Yes, the west huffed and puffed. We introduced a few minor sanctions. But soon we lost interest. Putin is a liar and a ruthless dictator. Human rights groups have long documented his regime’s record of repression and terror. He is a kleptocrat; consider the plunder by him and his allies of Russia’s wealth. Some estimates say he has become the richest man on the planet. He has ruthless imperial ambitions, with his hankering to construct a “greater Russia”, with echoes of the old Soviet Union. He regularly resorts to excessive use of force. Witness the 334 hostages killed at Beslan school in 2004, including 176 children, or the 130 killed in the Moscow theatre siege. He understands only force, and a feather duster isn’t going to stop him. When he resigned as foreign secretary, Johnson said that his biggest mistake was how he dealt with Russia. Today was another lost opportunity. We appear weak, spineless and vacillating. We still don’t seem able to wean ourselves off Russian money, and government communications are so chaotic that it’s unclear whether we think Russia has invaded Ukraine yet or not. We need much tougher, wider sanctions. We need reform of Companies House so we know the truth behind shell companies. We need a new Foreign Lobbying Act, reform to the Official Secrets Act and the immediate publication of the review into tier 1 visas. In my book, Putin has crossed the line. MPs of all hues agree. We are keen for the UK and her allies to put on a united front – and show some real mettle Chris Bryant is the Labour MP for Rhondda and a member of the Commons foreign affairs select committee ",Opinion/Opinion,These pathetic sanctions won’t hurt Putin.

2/23/2022,"Boots is to offer individual lateral flow tests for as much as £5.99, including delivery, from Wednesday as retailers gear up for the end of widely available free tests. The UK’s biggest pharmacy business said customers would be able to order one test online from Wednesday or pay £17 for a pack of four, including delivery within two days. These tests will include the option to send results to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) but they cannot be used for travel requiring a negative antigen test certificate.  From early March, Boots said it would be possible to pick up lateral flow tests in more than 400 of its stores for £2.50 for one or £12 for a pack of five. These cheaper tests will also be available online with four tests priced at £9.50. Dan Shears, national health and safety director at the GMB union said: “This is rampant profiteering at the expense of working people. Almost £6 per test is a huge sacrifice for the lowest paid workers, and if they wish to test family members as well, then the cost will soon become prohibitive. “The government should provide tests for free – they are a clear public health benefit that far outweighs cost. But if we have to pay, test provision should be subsidised to make tests affordable. “The reality is that those who are most at risk are least able to afford testing, meaning it will not happen and low-paid workers – many of whom are key workers - will continue to take the brunt of Covid.” Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC union body, agreed that free tests must remain in place. She said: “Introducing charges for Covid tests in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis is both heartless and reckless. This decision will hit low-income and frontline workers the hardest – at a time when many are struggling to make ends meet. Do ministers really want low-paid staff – with public-facing jobs – to go into work untested?” Asif Aziz, director of healthcare services at Boots UK, said: “We are pleased to be expanding our Covid-19 testing services even further, with affordable lateral flow testing options for those who still want peace of mind from asymptomatic testing. “While it is great that we are returning to normal and finding a way to live with Covid-19, we encourage our customers and patients to stay safe and continue to take measures to limit the spread of the virus, especially to those in vulnerable groups.” Free testing for the general public will end in England from 1 April, with most people having to pay for lateral flow and PCR tests including those visiting people in care homes. There will be some exceptions. Free symptomatic tests will continue to be available for NHS patients and those in care homes, and some asymptomatic testing for both. More broadly, the UKHSA has yet to set out which other groups will remain eligible for free tests, although availability is expected to be limited to people aged 80 and above or those with compromised immune systems only. There will also be tests kept for the Panoramic study, which is assessing the efficacy of antiviral drugs, the Vivaldi scheme, examining Covid in care homes, and Siren, which looks at the NHS. Announcing the change of plan on Monday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, emphasised “personal responsibility” as the best way to control Covid-19 from now on. Johnson said the primary line of defence would be “pharmaceutical interventions”, such as antivirals and vaccines. However, concerns have been raised about testing for NHS staff and other workers dealing regularly with the general public. The British Independent Retailers Association, which represents thousands of small local shops, said it was concerned about the end of free testing. “Employers have a duty of care and need to know if they are required to provide testing facilities to employees – if yes then the kits should be free to employers,” said Andrew Goodacre, the chief executive of the trade body.",News/Business,Boots to charge £5.99 for one lateral flow test as UK ends free packs,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/boots-unveils-lateral-flow-test-prices-as-uk-ends-free-test-packs
