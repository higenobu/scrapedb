12/26/2021,"Ministers have been urged to retain a facility that can swiftly create and test new vaccines, amid concerns over the sale of a leading centre originally designed to prepare Britain for future pandemics. Some senior medical figures have privately raised concerns that government officials are examining bids for the Vaccine Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (VMIC), near Oxford, which has benefited from millions in public funding during its development.  John Bell, who has held a series of influential roles in the government’s Covid-19 response, said that the centre’s vaccine manufacturing capabilities might be best placed in the hands of a large pharmaceutical company. However, he added that a facility looking at vaccine innovation and trialling – the original vision for VMIC – should be maintained. “Here’s the worry,” he said. “Let’s say we get a big [pharmaceutical company] come in and start making routine vaccines of one sort or another. That’s all fine. But the whole point of this was to further enable innovation, so that we would actually have the novel vaccines when you needed them. The AstraZeneca vaccine came out of that kind of thinking. “The real risk is we’re going to lose the ability to do that early phase stuff that actually told us that you could use the adenovirus to make really good vaccines. There’s a whole host of new vaccine platforms at very early stages of development that will need to be evaluated in what was the original vision for the VMIC. If you lose that, you really do lose a crucial bit of the puzzle. You can imagine, there’s a risk that that’ll get fudged. I think that would be a real problem.” Bell’s intervention echoes that of Clive Dix, the former head of the government’s vaccine taskforce, who said in an Observer interview in November that he had seen no evidence that his plans for preparing the country for future Covid variants were being heeded. He also said that he believed the UK was no longer “on the front foot” in tackling the pandemic. Kate Bingham, the original chair of the vaccine taskforce, has also claimed “the waters have closed over” the innovative approach taken when the pandemic arrived. Several companies are said to have submitted bids for the VMIC. Its establishment was announced by the government in 2018 to develop vaccines in the UK and deal with future pandemics. Insiders said that plans were changed as Covid struck and its manufacturing capabilities became the priority. It had been scheduled to open in 2023, but its opening was brought forward to next year. Some insiders said that placing VMIC in the hands of a large pharmaceuticals manufacturer was the best use for the facility. However, Bell said more time should be given to considering how an innovation centre for vaccines could be retained. “That would be a really interesting idea and I’m not sure whether they’ve thought about that very hard,” he said. “It’s not beyond the wit of man for the government to sell on the scale-up facility, and then go back and say: we are going to carry on with the original small-scale innovation idea. We’re just going to set it up again, as it was intended in the first place, and take 18 months to build it. I think that would be the best solution, frankly.” The government said: “We are working closely with VMIC, which is a private company, and others to ensure the UK retains our strong domestic vaccine manufacturing capability to contribute to the UK’s resilience against Covid-19 and other future health emergencies. The government has invested over £380m to secure and scale up the UK’s manufacturing capabilities to be able to respond to the impact of Covid-19, as well as any future pandemics.”",News/Society,Plans to sell off UK vaccine development centre criticised by scientists,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/26/plans-to-sell-off-uk-vaccine-development-centre-criticised-by-scientists
12/26/2021,"Among the hundreds of thousands of seafarers left stranded by Covid-19, perhaps none have faced an ordeal as extreme as that of the i-Kiribatis. Last weekend, after a year-long odyssey across continents – shuttled between foreign nations and locked out of their homeland as waves of coronavirus closed down previously safe routes – that ordeal finally came to an end.  In a palm-fringed courtyard in Tarawa, the capital of the small Pacific island nation of Kiribati, tears and shouts of joy greeted 141 seafarers during an emotional reunion with families they had not seen for almost two years. Temware Iotebwa, 39, said that at first he did not spot his children – his son, Tawati, 15, and daughters Sherlene, 11, Eilene, 6, and three-year-old AyMe – in the crowd. But their shouts quickly drew tears to his eyes. “When my younger kids first saw me, they were shouting and calling my name,” says Iotebwa, who last saw his children in February 2020. “Hearing their voices and seeing their faces brought tears of joy to my eyes. That Sunday was one of my happiest days. We laughed and we cried, and I got a lot of hugs.” Iotebwa, an able seaman, had worked a month of a nine-month contract on the Hamburg Süd/Maersk container ship MV Monte Pascoal, when the pandemic was declared. He disembarked in Belgium, before being flown to Fiji. He and his crewmates have spent the past nine months in limbo, sharing cramped hotel rooms and unable to tell their families when they would see them again. Of the estimated 1.7 million seafarers worldwide, more than half are from developing countries such as Kiribati, a low-lying nation of 33 islands with one of the lowest standards of living in Oceania and a poor healthcare system. Concerned that it might not be able to cope, Kiribati responded to the pandemic in 2020 by closing its borders. The strategy successfully kept Covid cases at zero. But for Iotebwa and his fellow i-Kiribati seafarers, it meant a year of hell, caught in the middle of protracted negotiations between the shipping companies, the International Chamber of Shipping and a Kiribati government fearful of the risks of allowing the return of seafarers who may have been exposed to Covid. Finally, in April 2021, after months of talks, the Kiribati government agreed to repatriate the seafarers, who would first be quarantined in Fiji. But then Fiji saw a sudden spike in coronavirus cases and the Kiribati government reversed its policy. After allowing about 60 seafarers back into the country, the authorities closed the border again, with no exceptions. Iotebwa had just been told he was about to be flying home when it happened. It was his lowest moment, he says. “My excitement turned to hopelessness when I heard the news,” he says over a video link from Tarawa. “The waiting time turned from days to months. My kids missed me very much and I missed them.” His family were worried too; the Grand Melanesian Hotel in the Fijian town of Nadi, paid for by the shipping company, was overcrowded and uncomfortable with no privacy. “It felt like a prison,” he says. “My wife, Takentemwanoku Matiota Iotebwa, constantly reminded me to be careful and to stay away from people to avoid getting infected. She was very worried.” They kept their spirits up by playing games of croquet and tug-of-war in the lobby. He is happy now he is back at home, but there is sadness, too. One of his friends lost his father, another his wife. Marriages broke up under the strain of waiting and the ordeal has taken a financial toll on the families. The seafarers are often their families’ main breadwinners and a source of remittances. They stopped being paid in early 2021, and now worry about their employment prospects with borders remaining closed. “I don’t blame anyone because this pandemic can happen anytime and anywhere,” says Iotebwa. “But if my government was smart, it could have found other ways to bring us seafarers home sooner. Other poorer countries arranged their seafarers’ return immediately while still on lockdown.” The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) held a crisis meeting this month with transport organisations “as a matter of urgency” to protect the rights of those working at sea. Seafarers provided remittances to 12% of households in Kiribati in 2010, and the sector is an important source of employment. Pastor Matthias Ristau, a chaplain at the German Seamen’s Mission, helped care for 150 of i-Kiribati’s seafaring community who were stuck in a youth hostel in Hamburg for months before being flown to Fiji. “I could see these were really tough guys but after so many months at sea they were already exhausted,” he says. “And all the time hearing about families breaking, marriages splitting … I know it will take them a long time to finally arrive at home mentally.” Natalie Shaw, director of employment affairs at the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), says the plight of the i-Kiribati is the biggest challenge she has faced in 18 years – including piracy. Shaw, who was instrumental in negotiations between the Kiribati government, German and Danish shipping authorities and various UN agencies, said it had caused sleepless nights for her. An additional 110 i-Kiribati men remain stranded. “I won’t be happy until we get the rest home,” she says. “We’ve had families in tears, thinking you don’t care. Every time we started to plan we got a new challenge, which makes it really difficult. There were multidimensional, multicountry challenges. “It became a lower priority for the powers that could have made it happen. Unfortunately,” she adds, “the seafarers are collateral damage in all of this.” Most of the seafarers worked on ships operated by Hamburg Süd, a German container line now owned by the Danish firm AP Møller-Maersk. In March the seafarers, who were scattered across the world, were flown to Denmark and Hamburg by the shipping companies, in order to group them together for vaccinations and to make repatriation easier. René Pedersen, managing director of AP Møller-Maersk, said they had seafarers stranded in Denmark, Egypt, Korea, Malaysia and Australia. ““We entered into a dialogue with different governments” he says. “But the Kiribati government was very determined: the border was closed and we could not repatriate them.” Finally, in late 2021, Kiribati agreed the seafarers could sail home from Fiji on a small cruise ship, the MV Reef Endeavour, as long as they quarantined before landing on Kiribati soil. It took eight weeks, plus a two-week quarantine at either end. “It’s an indication of how fragile the global maritime industry is,” says Steve Cotton, general secretary of the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), who worked with the ICS to help the stranded seafarers. “We take labour from the global south – that definitely has cost advantages. But when the system breaks down, there’s no safety net.” The new action group led by the WHO and the ILO includes representatives from the ITF, the ICS, International Air Transport Association (Iata), and the International Road Transport Union. Together, they represent 65 million seafarers, aircrew and drivers. One of the group’s concerns is that many of those workers’ home nations lag significantly behind richer nations in vaccinations. Although the situation has improved recently, with an estimated 50% of seafarers vaccinated and the number working beyond their contracts dropping to 4.7% from 7%, the arrival of the Omicron variant has upended matters again, with at least 56 countries reimposing travel restrictions since its emergence.

12/26/2021,"Nicole Kidman sleeps badly. Recently she got up at 3am to Google that thing, with the leg, where, “It feels like it needs to move?” But more often she will lie there in the dark beside her husband, in her Nashville bed, their two daughters sleeping some rooms away, and make decisions. She will “contemplate”. Between midnight and seven, she says, coolly, is the most “confronting time”. It says a lot about Kidman, her prolific career, her sustained presence on film and glossy TV, that we can immediately picture her there, hair coiled on a pillow, eyes wide, the restless sense she has become claustrophobic in her own body. Kidman, 54, has been acting since she was 14, already 5ft 9in then, with skin that burned easily. She started in theatre partly as a way to get out of the Australian sun – a year later she was known locally (she told an early interviewer) for playing “older, sexually frustrated women”. Over the next 40 years she extended that repertoire, so now she is known for playing cryptic, adventurous, troubled women, too, in brave work that might not have been made were it not for her glittering star-power.  We were meant to be meeting in London, but the slipperiness of the pandemic meant a last-minute “pivot”, she says (“I must stop using that word!”), so Kidman greets me from New York in a pinstriped shirt and Zoom window labelled “Nic”. She is here to talk about Being the Ricardos, Aaron Sorkin’s new Oscar-tipped biopic about the relationship between I Love Lucy stars Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. So it’s there we start, listing its themes with a certain glee: ideas of home, family, marriage, of power and how gender complicates that, of motherhood. “Well that’s just it,” she says. “That’s my whole life. I love that you can describe the film, and then it correlates to my life. Isn’t that fantastic?” The film takes place across one fraught week in the 1950s at the height of the “queen of comedy’s” fame, when Ball and Arnaz (played by Javier Bardem) are juggling the professional implications of a new pregnancy, accusations of communism and allegations of infidelity that eventually lead to divorce. “It’s about a creative and romantic relationship that doesn’t work out. But from it come some extraordinary things. And I love that. I love that it’s not a happy ending.” She takes a swig from a large bottle of water that, at first glance, appears to be wine. “This film says you can make an extraordinary relationship thrive and leave remnants of it that exist forever. Yeah, that’s really gorgeous. You can’t make people behave how you want them to, and sometimes you’re going to fall in love with someone who isn’t going to be the person you spend the rest of your life with. And I think that’s all very relatable. You may have kids with them. You may not, but they were very much in love.” We pause. Is this, I ask with exquisite care, your way of talking about Tom Cruise? She chokes, just a little. “Oh, my God, no, no. Absolutely not. No. I mean, that’s, honestly, so long ago that that isn’t in this equation. So no.” She is angry. “And I would ask not to be pigeonholed that way, either. It feels to me almost sexist, because I’m not sure anyone would say that to a man. And at some point, you go, ‘Give me my life. In its own right.’” It is a more than fair point. Though the two were married (and adopted two children) she has had at least two whole lives since their split, a year after the 1999 release of Eyes Wide Shut, the psychosexual drama they made with Stanley Kubrick. A decade of bold films followed, including Moulin Rouge and The Hours, for which she won a best actress Oscar. In 2006, she married country music star Keith Urban and she still dissolves a little at the mention of his name. “We say to each other,” she smiles: “‘You’re enough’.” But when she reached her 40s and gave birth to a daughter, she found the industry suddenly less hospitable. She decided to politely retire. To, “have my baby and sit on a farm. Until my mum said to me, ‘I don’t think you should just give up.’ I was quite convinced I could grow vegetables and be at home and be very satisfied with that, but was pushed quite substantially by my mum. Friends, too – I have friendships that have permeated my life.” She’s known Jane Campion, who directed her in The Portrait of a Lady and Top of the Lake, since she was 14. “Those relationships are relevant. They’re the threads that pull you through, when people show up and go, ‘I know you and I believe in you’, and push you forward.” Her life and career choices, like the decision to set up her own production company as a response to an ageist industry, are, “Not always coming from a sense of confidence, like I know what I’m doing. Not at all. A lot of times I’m relying heavily on the people around to say, ‘You’ve got more in you.’” And then, after a fourth child (using a surrogate), came another life, where alongside a series of blockbusters and twisted indie films she carved out a career in “prestige” television, the kinds of glamorous programmes (like The Undoing and Nine Perfect Strangers) that we watched without once looking down at our phones. Critics said she was making her best work yet. That her midlife career renaissance was not just good for her, but good for women everywhere. She was surprised. “I would never have thought television would be an avenue for growth for me.” The breakthrough was Big Little Lies, which she produced with an old friend, Reese Witherspoon, and won an Emmy for her portrayal of Celeste, whose poise and perfection masked violent abuse. “Television gives you a much stronger connection with an audience, because you’re in their homes. I had a far deeper response than I’d ever had, which just suddenly came hurtling towards me.” People would approach her to talk about, she says in quote marks, “A ‘friend’” in a similar situation to Celeste. “It was… quite lovely.” The last time she remembers her work resonating like that was with the film Lion – she was nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of the adoptive mother of a boy searching for his biological family. “It was a very disarming thing. My sister sat next to me during a screening, a dark theatre, just the two of us, and she was wrecked. She was just… destroyed by it.” Which Kidman loved. “The idea of penetrating people, so their guards come down, is beautiful.” She smiles. “Then the way we reach out and help, hold each other’s hands. Which has been taken from us recently, hasn’t it? There’s something incredibly beautiful about being held. About feeling safe.” Her face suddenly shifts. “Sorry. It just makes me cry that we’ve had that taken away. People in hospitals not being able to be held in their final moments. I… can’t take it.” Does she cry often? “Yes.” What was the last thing that made her cry? “That’s too personal,” she smiles. “But yeah, I cry. I try to keep a lid on that, but everything is deeply sad. There’s a huge melancholia, right? I mean, when you really study melancholy people, we’re very present. I have an enormous amount of that. I think a lot of people walk around with it too, don’t you?” Her family are flying to Australia for Christmas, to see her 81-year-old mother who was widowed when Kidman’s beloved father, a psychologist, died in 2014. “Today I was looking at my phone, and you know how they have those memory things, where they show you random photos? I looked and then, his face was there…” She shakes her head, startled by grief. I want more on her family, on life with two young daughters, but with a gentle apology she dismisses my questions. “No, I have to really protect them. I’ve learned to keep my mouth shut.” A Hollywood grin. I grudgingly respect her boundaries, I say. “Thank you. They’re something I’ve struggled with in the past.” Is it difficult knowing what to give and what to keep? “Yes, which is why I have the work. To speak through. But also,” she pauses, and considers how much to share, “I’m ‘in life’ right now.” She leans forward, her face suddenly filling the screen. “I’m not coasting along. I’m in it.” She is raising a 10-year-old and a 13-year-old, she is caring for her elderly mother, working solidly through the pandemic and, also, being a movie star. “That term confuses me. Can you define it? It’s too cerebral for me. I can only go to what Stanley Kubrick would say to me, which was, ‘Nicole, you’re a character actress.’ Usually, I’m resistant to labels. There’s a new generation now, saying, ‘No, you don’t get to define me just this way.’ I’m hugely supportive of this. And you can also change. I love that.” How does fame impact her life? “Why are you so interested in the famous thing?” she asks, a little irritably. Well, I stutter, because you seem to be a real person – “Oh my God!” – and yet also a star. OK. She nods. “I don’t live that life. I’m deeply embedded in a family, in a very deep marriage. I’m parenting children. I’m a daughter. Those are the primary things. And yes, I have other things that circulate. But at my base are relationships that are very, to use your word, ‘real’.” She chuckles stagily. “And I’d love to have them be more rose coloured and fluffy, but they’re startlingly real, as is mortality, as are all of those things that you circle as a human being. The only thing I can bring to my work is that emotional truth. My life is my life – I’m left alone with that ultimately, right? I mean, you’re not working at 3am, lying in bed.” There is a brief pause, in which I visualise her pillow, possibly silk. She sleeps badly. The leg. The contemplation. The phone memories unbidden. “I’m in the midst of it, a woman in her 50s, with a whole lot of things, circling.” She is prepared to use some of these things, these vulnerabilities, to bring them to her work, “But not all of them. Because that’s not fair. To me. To my relationships. I can give a portion of it, really deeply. But I have to do it in a very safe place with people that I trust not to abuse it or hurt me. And we’re going to value it.” I’m interested in Kidman’s fame not just because of the dissonance between that inscrutable celebrity and the mischievous mum I meet today, but because her stardom is of the extreme kind. Never for her the Ugg-booted Starbucks run, the candid Instagram posts, even the casual political affiliations. Her wild and glittering fame, I realise, is not in spite of an audience never quite knowing her, it is because of it. Her 40-year career seems to have taught her the importance of staying a stranger to your audience, who need that distance – not just the length of a cinema or barrier of a screen, but the psychic separation – to maintain the dream and the desire, the belief that she can, over the course of a single popcorned day, be a witch, a courtesan, Lucille Ball and a gaslit Manhattan therapist with a very nice coat. One warm afternoon she was at the Cannes Film Festival chatting to Meryl Streep when the conversation turned inevitably to work, and the lack of opportunities for women. “Directors, writers, crew-members – the figures were astounding.” They paused, and I imagine them languidly nursing their sparkling waters before making a pact. “There was a lot of talk about how things were changing. But then I was like, ‘We’ve actually got to do something.’” Kidman pledged to star in a female-directed film or show every 18 months. She has exceeded that. “It was my way of going, ‘Hold me accountable.’” Success, she’s clear, comes with responsibility. “My commitment to this industry is that I will give a platform for new voices to come forward and they can piggyback on me… That’s part of the ‘paying it forward’.” What this looks like is a lot more Kidman on screen, and riskier work, and presumably a pay-cut, too. “I could rest. Or I could actually do what I promised I’d do. Sure, I’m tired. But at the same time, I feel this strong sense that I need to stop talking about it, and actually… do it.” There’s a further motivation, too. “I have a 13 year old who wants to be a director – she’s really interested in comedy.” She opens her eyes very wide, as if to say, “Imagine!” As a child, her feminist mother would take her to meetings of the Women’s Electoral Lobby. “A hundred women, sitting around talking and smoking. I can’t remember the actual conversations, but I remember eating a lot of biscuits.” The truest feminist act. It’s these meetings I think of when she tells me her dream of building a kind of studio. “Creating a real home for 10 or 15 women, all working out of one little area, supported completely. I’d love to be able to get things made without having to actually be in them, to just generate it without having to actually put my own body on screen.” I’m surprised to hear she doesn’t have that power. “Not yet.” She sits up even taller, her chin raised like battle is near. As they completed Being the Ricardos, Kidman approached Aaron Sorkin with a question. “I said, ‘The first time I see the film, I want to do it with an audience.’ He was like, ‘Are you insane?’ But I couldn’t bear the idea of sitting in a dark room and watching myself playing Lucille Ball going, ‘I’m dreadful.’” So, tentatively, Sorkin took her to a screening, where she sat in a state of clenched torture as the lights went down. And then? “Then I heard people laugh. And it was so good.” Known for the grace she brings to serious roles, she’d tried to pull out of the film at least once, scared that she wasn’t the right person to play an iconic comedy star. But then she started crushing grapes. On set as Lucille, she tucked her skirt into a belt and lowered herself barefoot into a vat of grapes, and, her mouth a lipsticked grimace, she crushed them into wine. “It was so freeing! The abandonment – it was wonderful. I didn’t want to give that up. I can do that grape sequence to a tee, but I only got to do it three times.” She’s leaning into the camera again, her eyes round, deadly serious about the transportive joy of clowning. “I kept asking Aaron, ‘Can I do it again?’” A heavy smile. “Can I do it again?” Being the Ricardos is now in select cinemas and on Amazon Prime Video",Arts/Film,"‘I’m not just coasting along’: Nicole Kidman on fame, family and what keeps her awake at night",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/26/im-not-just-coasting-along-nicole-kidman-on-fame-family-and-what-keeps-her-awake-at-night
12/26/2021,"It is one of the great causes célèbres of the cold war. At around noon on 29 October 1965, Mehdi ben Barka, a Moroccan opposition leader and hero of the international left, was abducted as he arrived at a brasserie on Paris’s left bank. Over the years, much of the truth about the murder of the 46-year-old dissident has emerged: how he was taken to a house south of Paris, tortured and killed by Moroccan intelligence agents. But many of Ben Barka’s activities before his death have remained shrouded in mystery. Now new research in the archives of former Soviet satellite states has revealed that the charismatic intellectual, propagandist and political organiser may also have been a spy.  Previously classified files from Prague show that Ben Barka not only had a close relationship with the Státní Bezpečnost (StB), the feared Czechoslovak security service, but that he received substantial payments from it, both in cash and in kind. “Ben Barka is often depicted as a fighter against colonial interests and for the third world, but the documents reveal a very different picture: a man who was playing many sides, who knew a lot and knew too that information was very valuable in the cold war; an opportunist who was playing a very dangerous game,” said Dr Jan Koura, an assistant professor at Charles University in Prague, who gained access to the file. The findings will be controversial. Ben Barka is still a hero for many on the left, and his family adamantly deny any accusations that he was involved in espionage or had close ties with any state. A possibility of a link between Ben Barka and the StB was first raised almost 15 years ago, though few paid much attention to investigations by a Czech journalist. But Koura was not only able to access the entire Ben Barka file in the StB archives but cross-check its 1,500 pages with thousands of other newly released secret documents. “There is no doubt about [the Czech connection]. All the documents confirm it,” Koura told the Observer. According to the file consulted by Koura, Ben Barka’s relationship with the StB began in 1960, when he met its most senior spy in Paris after leaving Morocco to escape the increasingly authoritarian rule of King Mohammed V. His homeland, a former French colony, had been pro-western since the beginning of the cold war but had recently tilted closer to Moscow. Prague’s spies hoped this prominent leader of Morocco’s fight for independence and founder of its first socialist opposition party would provide valuable intelligence, not just about political developments in the kingdom but also about the thinking of Arab leaders such as Egypt’s president, Gamal Abdel Nasser. Ben Barka was also a major figure in the “anti-imperialist movement of African and Asian nations”, the StB noted, whose contacts included Malcolm X, Che Guevara and the young Nelson Mandela. Soon after their first meetings, the StB was reporting that Ben Barka was a source of “extremely valuable” information and gave him the codename “Sheikh”, the archives reveal. By September 1961, according to the file, Ben Barka had received 1,000 French francs from the StB for reports about Morocco that he claimed were copied from the internal bulletin of France’s overseas intelligence service. In fact, the material was publicly available, which led to anger and embarrassment in Prague when the deception was discovered. Ben Barka was nonetheless then offered an all-expenses-paid trip to west Africa to gather intelligence on US activities in Equatorial Guinea. This mission was considered a success. The Czechoslovaks soon began to suspect that Ben Barka had relationships with other cold war players too, hearing in February 1962 from an operative in France that “Sheikh” had met an American trade unionist at L’Éléphant Blanc bar in Paris and received a cheque made out in US dollars. This led to concerns that Ben Barka had connections to the CIA, which was keen to support democratic reform in Morocco and secure the kingdom for the western camp. The StB was to receive further reports alleging Ben Barka was in contact with the US, though the Moroccan politician always denied this when confronted, Koura said. The relationship continued nonetheless. The Czechoslovaks invited Ben Barka to Prague, where he agreed to help influence politics and leaders in Africa in return for £1,500 a year. Ben Barka was despatched to Iraq to obtain information on the coup of February 1963, for which he received £250, according to the documents. In Algeria, he repeatedly met Ahmed ben Bella, the president and a friend, and reported on the situation in the newly independent state. In Cairo, he was asked to gather information from senior Egyptian officials that could help the Soviets in negotiations during a visit by Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet premier. Ben Barka’s reports reached Soviet intelligence services, which judged the material provided as “highly valuable”. As a reward for his services, he and his four children were invited on holiday to a spa in Czechoslovakia, Koura’s research reveals. “Ben Barka never admitted that he was collaborating [with intelligence services], and the StB never listed him as an agent, just as a “confidential contact”. But he was providing information, and was paid,” Koura said. “He was very clever, a very smart guy. There is no document with his signature, there are no samples of his writing. He was questioned orally for hours ... Occasionally, he used a typewriter but refused to write anything by hand.” The motives of Ben Barka, a committed activist who was arrested and imprisoned repeatedly in Morocco, remain unclear. His defenders say he was willing to repeatedly discuss the international situation with Czechoslovak officials as this was the best way to influence them. They also say that although Ben Barka’s analyses may have been useful to the StB, this does not make him “an agent”, whatever was written by ambitious bureaucrats and spies on internal memos. They argue too that such a role would have been incompatible with Ben Barka’s dedication to preserving “the third world movement from both Soviet and Chinese influence”. Bachir ben Barka, who lives in eastern France, told the Observer that his father’s relationships with socialist and other states were simply those to be expected of anyone deeply engaged in the global struggle against imperialism and colonial exploitation at the time, pointing out that the documents studied by Koura had been “produced by an intelligence service, [and so were] perhaps edited or incomplete”. Koura is less convinced of Ben Barka’s altruism. “There was both pragmatism and idealism. I don’t condemn him. The cold war was not just black and white,” he said. In his final months, Ben Barka was busy organising the Tricontinental Conference, an event that would bring together in Cuba dozens of liberation movements, revolutionary groups and their sponsors. The conference would become a crucial moment in the history of international anti-colonialism in the 1960s and 1970s, and the veteran activist wanted to chair the event. But the Soviets suspected he had become too close to the Chinese, their rivals for leadership of the global left. Soviet officials told the StB that Ben Barka had received $10,000 from Beijing, and pressured the service to withdraw any support or protection for him. Nonetheless, the StB brought Ben Barka to Prague for a week’s training in communications, codes, surveillance and counter-surveillance. This was too little, too late, however. A week after requesting a handgun from the StB, Ben Barka was abducted and killed.

12/26/2021,"With cases, deaths, reproduction numbers, opinion polls and more, we get bombarded with statistics every day. But how can you spot a naughty number, a shabby statistic or dubious data? Lists of questions have been given by Tim Harford, Dave and Tom Chivers, and in The Art of Statistics (which David wrote), with considerable overlap as they grapple with the same essentials. Here is the short list that we use ourselves. The first question: how trustworthy is the source of the story? Are they honest, competent and reliable or are they trying to manipulate my emotions, say by provoking anxiety or reassurance? Are they giving the whole picture or selecting bits to suit themselves? Like the review that found insects had declined, but it turned out had only searched for studies that showed a decline.  Second: how reliable is the statistic? A count may not be counting what we think it is: Covid cases only represent those who have symptoms and decide to have a PCR test and are becoming increasingly distinct from infections. Survey estimates seek to generalise from a sample to a target population, but have both margins of error and possible systematic biases, while model outputs reflect assumptions and selected scenarios. The uncertainty and the quality of the underlying evidence should be communicated with due humility. Third: how trustworthy is any claim being made on the basis of the data? Context is all; a “100% increased risk” may make the headlines, but twice not very much is still not very much. Historical statistics can provide a guide to whether something really is a big number. Differences may be attributed to cause rather than just correlation, since observational analyses can have systematic biases or lingering confounders. And sometimes there is basic misunderstanding of good data; ONS found that, among people testing positive, vaccination increased the chance someone would be Omicron rather than Delta, but this led to the claim that vaccination increased the risk of testing positive. Statistics enlighten our uncertain world, helping people make decisions. We need thoughtful consideration, not reflexive cynicism, when we see claims derived from statistical evidence.

12/26/2021,"In The Wicker Man (Robin Hardy, 1973), the key to the sacrifice’s efficacy is that Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodwoodward, 1930), embraces victimhood willingly. And so Liz Truss climbs into her photo-op tank and trundles gladly toward the burning wicker effigy of the role of Chief Negotiator for Exiting the European Union Brexit (formerly Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union), and the poisoned post claims another scalp. Greater love hath no man. Lord Frost understood. Did he really exit his Exit Secretary job because he no longer agreed with Boris Johnson’s general direction of travel, namely lurching from one leaking honeypot to another like a priapic bear? Or did the lordly Exiteer realise he could not exit the European Union in a fashion that would garnish his square head with coveted laurels? And so, unzipping the tent flap into the howling Arctic gale of public opinion, Lord Frost declared: “I’m just going to the pub with Brexit hardman Steve Baker’s European Research Group. I may be some time. Masks optional, of course.”  The artfully cantilevered Good Friday pivot, which discreetly emolliated the island of Ireland in 1998, fractures and ferments; furious fishermen and farmers fulminate fruitlessly into foam and fertiliser, respectively; our brightest creative talents lower their life expectations accordingly as earnings, market access, postal rates, touring options and cross-border collaborations collapse; despite Michael Gove’s claims to better EU environmental rules post-Brexit, once more we are swimming in human sewage; once more we are known as the “dirty man of Europe” (at least until Allegra Stratton’s revelations about Boris Johnson’s love life surface); and a scheme to lure Nobel laureates to work in buccaneering Brexit Britain attracted precisely no takers worldwide, making us the intellectual destination equivalent of Eddie Murphy’s 2002 box office bomb, The Adventures of Pluto Nash. Was Boris Johnson’s finally all-too obvious incompetence, dishonesty and lack of any coherent plan, beyond what might get him either elected or noshed off, merely a useful fig leaf to cover the chief Exiteer’s exit from the unwinnable forever war against the phantoms of Europe? The lie-fuelled promises of the Brexit campaign can never be delivered. It is a package, like that gatefold vinyl copy of Hawkwind’s Space Ritual I ordered from a previously reliable French dealer via discogs.com, that appears undeliverable in the post-Brexit world. Brexit did, however, deliver the most right-leaning government in living memory. Was that the idea all along? Slaps head. Falls over. Cries. Faithful leave-voting red wall constituents, pining for levelling up and Brexit dividends, will be delighted that Lord Frost’s Exiteer replacement, Liz Truss, voted remain in 2016, and was the co-author of the 2012 Tory manifesto-in-waiting, Britannia Unchained. Britannia Unchained opined that “the British are among the worst idlers in the world… Whereas Indian children aspire to be doctors or businessmen, the British are more interested in football and pop music.” What is a “Beatle”, eh Liz? And why have all the footballers got long hair now, like girls? For your information, Truss, both British football and British pop music have been massive engines for your vaunted social mobility, and key elements of the soft diplomacy that briefly made Britain less universally hated all around the world. A Kurdish nomad on the Syrian border in 1988 bonded with me over his tape of Sheffield’s Def Leppard. With all due respect, the goat-herding tent-dweller had nothing to say about the quality of British businessmen. And there’s a generation of British schoolchildren that take their moral inspiration from Marcus Rashford, not from vegetable magnate Andrew Bridgen, the Igor homunculus of Brexit hardman Steve Baker, who so delighted in his master’s performative online defenestration of snowflake Nadine Dorries this week. (“Go on Steve! Bloody Nadine with her confusing shiny hair!! Get her!!! Oh!!!!! I’ve made a mess in my pants, Steve!!!!!”) Believe it or not, the kids aren’t doing collages of Bridgen’s stinking Leicestershire vegetable distribution hub, or Boris Johnson’s lockdown cheese-and-wine work non-party. They’re making murals of Marcus Rashford. To be fair, Truss didn’t write Britannia Unchained alone. Her co-authors were: the thinking woman’s thug Kwasi Kwarteng, Boris Johnson’s brutish Golem-enforcer, who spent a November press round trying to bully parliamentary standards commissioner Kathryn Stone into resigning, unaware that focus-polling at CCHQ had already decided to ditch Owen Paterson, leaving Kwarteng looking like a gormlessly obedient snap-on tool, both fanatically loyal and fatally un-looped; Dominic Raab, who lasted four months as Truss’s Exiteer predecessor, having revealed he didn’t know where Calais was, defended the Tories’ falsified online independent fact checking service during the 2019 election, and floated about on a paddle board during the rout of Kabul, like the devil made flesh by Silvia Pinal in a Luis Buñuel film; Priti Patel, who was bailed out personally by Boris Johnson when she breached the ministerial code for bullying, and threatens regulations against dying drowning children, Darth Vader pointing the Death Star at Alderaan; and Chris Skidmore, the MP for Kingswood, only known at all because a covert 2019 investigation into the Westminster laundry service by Vice magazine found Skidmore to have more skids in his pants than any other politician, a nominatively determined quirk which Andrew Bridgen secretly envied. Everything that is awful about the modern Conservative party is embodied by Truss’s collaborators in Britannia Unchained, which should make her a perfect fit for the Wicker Woman’s flaming frame. Britannia ashamed requires a sacrifice. So far, the role of Chief Negotiator for Exiting the European Union has claimed five victims, six if you remember that David Davis did it twice, having forgotten that he’d already done it all wrong once already. Nothing is achieved. Another body goes up in flames, the carcass shunted into another cabinet position. The peasants dance and sing, and wait out the winter.

12/26/2021,"Eating less meat will play a key role in helping Spain mitigate the effects of the climate emergency, slow the process of desertification, and protect its vital tourism industry, the country’s consumer affairs minister has said. Alberto Garzón said people in Spain needed to realise the huge impact that eating meat – particularly beef raised on industrial megafarms – had on the environment, and to change their eating habits accordingly.  “People here know about the part that greenhouse gases play in climate change, but they tend to link it to cars and transport,” Garzón told the Guardian. “It was only very recently that everyone started to look at the impact of the animal consumer chain and, especially, at the impact of beef. Other countries were pretty advanced on that but in Spain it’s been a taboo.” The minister said that the country’s geography made it profoundly vulnerable to climate change, adding the Spain people know and love is in danger of disappearing forever. “If we don’t act, it won’t just be climate change we’re dealing with – it’ll be the triple crisis: the loss of biodiversity; pollution, and climate change,” he said. “It would be the end for a country like Spain. Spain is a country in the Mediterranean basin – it isn’t the UK or Germany – and desertification is a very serious problem for our country, not least because it depends so much on tourism. Visiting a desert isn’t quite as attractive as visiting the Costa del Sol.” Garzón says Spaniards need not stop eating meat altogether but suggests they eat far less and ensure it’s good quality for the sake of their health and the environment. He contrasts cheap, mass-produced products with traditionally reared meat. “Extensive farming is an environmentally sustainable means of cattle farming and one that has a lot of heft in parts of Spain such as Asturias, parts of Castilla y León, Andalucía and Extremadura,” he said. “That is sustainable; what isn’t at all sustainable is these so-called mega-farms … They find a village in a depopulated bit of Spain and put in 4,000, or 5,000, or 10,000 head of cattle. They pollute the soil, they pollute the water and then they export this poor quality meat from these ill-treated animals.” The minister also pointed to a recent report that found that 20 livestock companies are responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than either Germany, Britain or France. Garzón, an economist who is the coordinator for the United Left alliance in Spain’s Socialist-led coalition government, made headlines when he urged people to reduce their meat consumption in July. He noted the average Spaniard eats more than 1kg of meat a week although the country’s food agency recommends people eat between 200g and 500g, and that Spain eats more meat than any other EU country, slaughtering 70 million pigs, cows, sheep, goats, horses and birds each year to produce 7.6m tonnes of meat. His calls were roundly mocked and dismissed – not least by his own partners in government. The agriculture minister said the farming sector was being subjected to “profoundly unfair criticisms when it deserved respect for the honest work it does for both our food and our economy”, while the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, appeared to scoff at the suggestion, saying: “Speaking personally, a medium-rare steak is hard to beat.” Garzón attributes the friendly fire to what he diplomatically terms “the differing programmes and policies” of the coalition parties, and says he always knew taking on the industrial meat industry would provoke a furious response. “We knew from the start that the issue would be controversial, but it needed to be done,” he said. “Other countries – like Germany, the UK and France – are well ahead of us on this. This was the first time in Spain that someone in the government was saying what the scientists have been saying for a long time.” The minister also noticed that most of the public criticism came from men who apparently “felt their masculinity would be affected by not being able to eat a piece of meat or have a barbecue”. Women, on the other hand, were far more open to the message. “We think that part of society was already ready for this and had got its head round this,” he said. “But we still needed to push and there wasn’t a single political party that supported us. Not one. Not even within the governing coalition.” Nevertheless, Garzón is convinced that Spain is finally having a long overdue public discussion over meat. “Civil society organisations and associations of ecologists, paediatricians, doctors and nutritionists all came out to defend us all the way,” he said. “I think that helped us win the debate because the issue was debated for three days on all the news programmes and in bars.” The minister’s other reforms – which include a crackdown on Spain’s betting industry, a ban on unhealthy food advertisements aimed at children and a symbolic toy strike to highlight gender stereotypes – have not always endeared him to certain businesses. They have also made him a favourite target for the Spanish right, who accuse him of meddling in people’s lives. Garzón’s attempts to point out the sexism inherent in many toys was recently given short shrift by the far-right Vox party. “I think Garzón forgets that it’s up to us as parent to decide what we buy,” said its Madrid spokesperson, Rocío Monasterio. “I’m going to go out and buy loads of dolls and cribs for my girls and I’m going to get cars and tractors and tanks for my nephews. And I think over Christmas we should all stuff our faces with meat.”",News/World news,"Spanish should eat less meat to limit climate crisis, says minister",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/26/spanish-should-eat-less-meat-to-limit-climate-crisis-says-minister
12/26/2021,"The number of women in temporary accommodation has increased by 88% over the last decade, according to research suggesting single mothers have been disproportionately affected by homelessness. Almost one in three lone mothers are either in arrears with their rent or facing a constant struggle to keep their home, equating to 321,000 women. There are now 75,410 women in temporary accommodation, an increase on pre-Covid levels despite the extra help put in place during the pandemic.  Women have made up a disproportionate share of those in temporary accommodation as they are more often in lower-paid, less-secure work and likely to have caring responsibilities. About 60% of the people in temporary accommodation in England are women. However, the sheer number of women requiring help is causing serious concern among homeless charities, with the increased cost of living pressures coming next year. The number has risen from 40,030 in 2011 to 75,410 today, according to Shelter research. It found that women with housing costs were 36% more likely than men to be in arrears or constantly struggling to afford them. More than two-thirds (69%) of women who rent privately worry they will not be able to afford anywhere decent to live if their relationship broke down. A series of in-depth interviews with 34 women and one non-binary person found a third of them had experienced domestic abuse, which often triggered their housing problems. Some lone mothers said they did not seek help as they were worried about having their children removed. Others said that their housing benefit no longer covered their rent, as private rents have continued to increase. Two-thirds said some professionals who dealt with their cases made them feel like a burden, with one woman describing feeling “fobbed off”. More than half the group said they did not know where to get help. Toni, 38, from Birmingham, who was made homeless after a relationship breakdown, said she was having to live in unsuitable temporary accommodation full of mould and areas inaccessible to her disabled son. “When you’re homeless, you don’t even get spoken to like you’re human,” she said. “Because you’re in temporary accommodation, people make assumptions about you. It doesn’t make me feel great – I’m not homeless through any choice of my own. I put on a brave face for the kids, but we can’t live a life in a temporary flat for ever. “This will be our fourth Christmas spent homeless - every year I say we’ll be gone by the next, but we’re still here. Temporary accommodation doesn’t feel very temporary when it’s been that long. I feel like we’ve been forgotten about.” The news comes as ministers attempt to curb homelessness this winter by ordering local authorities to offer “safe and appropriate” accommodation to thousands of people sleeping rough - including those with restricted eligibility because of immigration status. Polly Neate, Shelter’s chief executive, warned that women were bearing the brunt of a housing crisis that continued to escalate. “The hike in living costs and cuts to universal credit mean it’s only going to get tougher for thousands of women barely hanging on to their homes,” she said. “It’s appalling that women are being fobbed off by professionals who are supposed to help them, and it’s no wonder they feel scared and alone. To turn back the tide on women’s homelessness, we need to listen to women and better understand their needs.” The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “These figures reflect the increase in support for vulnerable groups which is preventing thousands of women from becoming homeless. However, we’re clear that temporary accommodation should only be a last resort. “Tackling homelessness is a government priority – that’s why we are spending £316m on this in the next year to build on the success of the Homelessness Reduction Act, which has prevented 400,000 households from becoming homeless or supported them to settled accommodation. We are continuing to work with councils and charities to meet our target of ending rough sleeping by the end of this parliament.”",News/Society,"Homelessness disproportionately affects single mothers, research reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/26/homelessness-disproportionately-affects-single-mothers-research-reveals
12/26/2021,"The Amazing Mr Blunden | Sky MaxThe Girl Before (BBC One) | iPlayerThe Wonder Years | Disney+BBC Sports Personality of the Year (BBC One) | iPlayerEmily in Paris | Netflix How was your Christmas Day? All life-affirming wonder or bah, humbug? Either way, there’s still time to view Sky’s seasonal offering, The Amazing Mr Blunden.  Based on Antonia Barber’s 1969 book The Ghosts, which was made into a 1972 film by Lionel “Railway Children” Jeffries, The Amazing Mr Blunden is a ghost story set in the modern day and 1821, with Mark Gatiss as writer, co-star and director. While not about Christmas, it resonates with yuletide themes: love, redemption, ghost orphans in pantaloons and petticoats needing help, a gothic, vine-choked mansion, and Simon Callow, as Blunden, enunciating dialogue with such magnificent violence, it’s a festive miracle there weren’t reports of plasma screens shattering nationwide. In the present day, a widowed, impoverished mother (Vinette Robinson) becomes the caretaker of a mansion. While there, her children, Lucy and Jamie (Tsion Habte and Jason Rennie), meet two child spirits, Sara and Georgie (India Fowler and Xavier Wilkins) – not ghosts but time-travellers who perished 200 years ago in a fire set by the scheming Mr and Mrs Wickens (Gatiss and Tamsin Greig, the latter resembling a Crimewatch photofit of Nanny McPhee) in order to steal Sara and Georgie’s inheritance. Blunden, their lawyer, ignored the children’s pleas for help: can this centuries-old wrong be righted? Gatiss’s adaptation has big britches to fill: the 70s film, starring Laurence Naismith, is a cult supernatural classic (check out Diana Dors as a chilling Mrs Wickens). Gatiss’s new version focuses far less on visceral creepiness, which is a shame: call me an old goth, but I like to feel spooked by spooks. Similarly – spoiler alert – whereas in the film, Blunden’s self-sacrifice is devastating, there isn’t quite the emotional connection here. What this update has in abundance is charm, humour, sterling child casting and excellent comic-grotesque turns, particularly from Amanda Lawrence as a hunched-over servant. For all his fruitiness, Callow is a convincingly regretful and magical Blunden. Alas, just not my Mr Blunden. Maybe in the new year we’ll see some complete dumps on television again. Instead of the show-home kitchens so beloved of current dramas, we’ll get woodchip wallpaper, maybe even some tone-lowering fridge magnets. For now, there’s BBC One’s The Girl Before, a four-part, London-set thriller directed by Lisa Brühlmann (Killing Eve), adapted by JP Delaney (AKA Tony Strong) from his own book, with Marissa Lestrade. Here, not just the kitchen but the entire place is a brick, steel, ultra-modernist smart house that you could imagine Tin Machine-era David Bowie living in. Architect Edward (David Oyelowo) charges minimal rent to people who agree to live by his rules: no pictures, ornaments, rugs, pets (breathing?). An extension of Edward’s control freakery, and a character in its own right, the house harvests data and has screens asking probing questions. An open staircase doubles as a death-drop. In different timezones, Edward accepts as residents a couple – Emma and Simon (Jessica Plummer and Ben Hardy) – and then a single woman, Jane, played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw. Both women are reeling from extreme personal trauma, both end up in relationships with sinister Edward, but why do they bear a striking resemblance to each other? Furthermore, how did someone die in the house, and what happened to Edward’s wife? What starts out promisingly, almost like a latterday spin on Bluebeard folk tale, sadly unravels until you’re left with a lukewarm 50 Shades bolted on to an uneven murder mystery. The main performances are strong (Oyelowo in his icy control; Mbatha-Raw and Plummer in their despair and determination), but the women’s capitulation to Edward’s invasive demands verges on farcical – even given London’s deranged housing market – while the shock denouement seems reverse-engineered to be as unlikely as possible. The cosy late 80s/early 90s sitcom The Wonder Years has been resurrected on Disney+, and this time the focus is on a black family living the American dream in 1968 Alabama, with Don Cheadle narrating. The original series featured the growing pains of Kevin, memorably played by Fred Savage, who, along with Saladin K Patterson (Psych) and Lee Daniels (Empire), exec-produces this new 22-episode series, and directs some of the episodes. The result is thoughtful, even bold, with 12-year-old Dean (Elisha Williams), his parents (Dulé Hill and Saycon Sengbloh) and siblings (Laura Kariuki and Spence Moore II) placed in the context of the volatile times. While the parents are upwardly mobile – “You’re going to college. I’m sure the revolution’s going to need a good dentist or accountant” – racism isn’t shied away from. In the opening two episodes, Dean’s daily frustrations (mainly involving an unrequited crush) are juxtaposed with everything from white pupils at his desegregated high school not wishing to share the same drinking fountain, to the shooting of Martin Luther King. As Savage, of all people, would know, it all hinges on the “everyboy”, and Williams glides winningly between drama, emotion and mischief. At this year’s BBC Sports Personality of the Year, 19-year-old US Openchampion Emma Raducanu triumphed, delightedly accepting her trophy remotely on screen, while the runners up – Olympic diver Tom Daley and Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty – applauded in the socially distanced studio. Over on Netflix, another enterprising young woman returned for a second 10-part series of Emily in Paris, starring Lily Collins as the young American marketer working, loving and dreaming in the city of love, while styled as Violet Elizabeth Bott crossed with Bertie Bassett. Since Emily in Paris was widely panned for crass stereotyping (it was also a huge lockdown hit, and Golden Globe-nominated), it’s dialled down the “aghast” American reactions to “scandalous” French behaviour (smoking, affairs et al). Though now there’s a caricatured English love interest (Lucien Laviscount) who barely stops short of doing the Lambeth walk. And, yes, we’re still supposed to sympathise with Emily for sleeping with her friend’s boyfriend (Lucas Bravo). I’m afraid I don’t. Still, it’s hard to remain angry, or indeed awake, as the episodes churn on. With its plaintive cultural asides (Balzac; Jules et Jim), Emily in Paris is merely frothy nonsense that yearns to be more. Be kind.

12/26/2021,"Last week we took the boy into Big Town for his first live, musical experience: a performance of The Lion King in the West End. It was a gift from his Uncle Darragh and Auntie Emilie, who clearly like him more than any of my aunts or uncles ever liked me. I didn’t get trips to see The Lion King when I was a kid. The best we could manage was pantos and nativity plays – and most of those had our own siblings in, which rather denuded them of mystique. I had my own time in the spotlight, of course, and few within Nazareth House Primary School’s Class of 1997 will ever forget my star turn as Reuben, the inexplicably French brother of Joseph in The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, which I conducted entirely dressed as Eric Cantona. Nor my role in our primary school nativity, in which I played an unlikely master of ceremonies named Pablo the Mexican Reindeer. Maybe it’s my former mastery of the stage which has me questioning the allure of taking a toddler to a two-hour theatrical extravaganza. Or maybe it’s the idea of making a three-year-old sit still without talking, screaming, crying or wetting himself throughout its duration.  Luckily, the boy enjoyed The Lion King very much. He clapped at every act break and as each new animal appeared, he helpfully shouted their name out loud, as if taking a roll of attendance for the theatre. He growled like a lion and, in case this didn’t get the point across, said quite loudly, ‘I’m a lion.’ He laughed at the funny parts and did seem suitably shaken by the more tragic moments, on which I won’t dwell here. It does feel weird to think I should avoid spoiling the bestselling musical of all time, which has been open for 23 years and grossed over $8bn, spun from the identical plot of a film which every single person on earth has also seen. I mean, at this point, it feels a little like spoiling the plot of that movie where those French lads land on the moon but, in any case, such was my son’s unwillingness to leave his seat he decided to hold in a wee well past straining point and interrupted his growling to shout: ‘I need toilet!!!!’ I leapt into action with the alacrity of one of those French lads who landed right in the moon’s eye, sashayed through 20 people to get my way to the only available toilet, mounting my son on the seat just in time for the trickle to start with no soiling or seepage whatsoever. My newfound appreciation for myself as an Action Dad was only slightly dimmed by the trip back, where I managed to hoist my son over my own head in such a fashion that, unbeknown to me, he kicked every single head of the row in front of us all the way back to our seats. Within minutes he was asleep and, by the time of curtain up, lay strewn across our laps like a long, snoring draught excluder. His trip to the jungle, the mighty jungle, had been a roaring success, and the lion slept tonight. Did Ye Hear Mammy Died? by Séamas O’Reilly is out now (Little, Brown, £16.99).

12/26/2021,"In January, when England’s third national lockdown was just beginning and most of us were blissfully ignorant of the middle letters of the Greek alphabet, I used these pages to make a prediction. Not about the pandemic but about another equally tedious and long-running nightmare that most people hoped would be over by now: the culture wars. I predicted that during 2021 what are called “contested histories” – those relating to empire, slavery and race – would be increasingly “weaponised for political gain” and that the historians who study them, along with the minority communities for whom contested histories are family histories, would be among the “new enemies” paraded before the culture war gallows.  It really wasn’t much of a prediction. Rather than unerringly foreseeing future events, I merely assumed that stuff that was already happening was going to keep happening and then get a bit worse. Not exactly a Nostradamus level prescience and, as it turned out, behind my attempt at prediction was a presumption that turned out to be wholly wide of the mark. What I utterly failed to foresee in January was that the Johnson government, along with the other branches of the UK’s vast ecosystem of performative outrage, would prosecute the war they themselves had fomented so incompetently. While millions were taken in by their false-flag arguments and confected divisions, over the course of 2021 much of their culture war schtick just didn’t land and at times it blew up in their faces. The most audacious culture war play of 2021 was the publication in March of the Sewell report, a cynical attempt to dismiss the importance and even the existence of structural racism and pit poor black people against poor white people in a zero-sum game for resources and legitimacy. Characterised by the government’s supporters as a piece of work that would reframe the national conversation around race, this masterclass in gaslighting began to disintegrate within hours of publication. What the Sewell report came up against were the very people from whom it had drawn its evidence, the experts across many fields who rapidly dissected the report line by line, showing how their work had been misinterpreted or misrepresented. Both the report’s findings and the methodology were trashed. Rolled out as culture war super-weapon, the Sewell report has only rarely been mentioned by government since. The other culture war lowlights of 2021 crashed and burned because time and again the government and its fellow travellers chose the wrong targets. It takes a special level of hubris for politicians, members of what is repeatedly voted the least trusted profession, to pick a fight with the England football team, superstars with millions of fans and Twitter followers, led by a manager who, according to one survey, has a popularity rating higher not just than both party leaders but even Winston Churchill. This summer, while most people in England were watching the Euros with hearts in mouths and fingers crossed, the government’s culture warriors were watching in sweaty-palmed horror, as the team whose anti-racist stance they had derided at the start of the tournament kept winning and growing in esteem. This led to the ludicrous pantomime of politicians dispatching their aides to the shops to buy replica England jerseys for last-minute photo-ops in which they expressed their support for players whom weeks earlier they had accused of “gesture politics”. Yet for real ineptitude we have to turn to Nigel Farage and his attempt to take on the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, one of the most beloved and respected organisations in the country. What Farage accused the RNLI of doing was saving lives at sea, so not exactly a case of mission creep. However, as the lives in question were those of desperate migrants, Farage set out to mobilise the thankfully small demographic who can be roused to frenzied anger at the thought of migrants not being left to drown in the English Channel. His attacks inspired a wave of abuse directed at RNLI staff, which has not subsided. But such ugly sentiments led to a huge upsurge of support for the RNLI and a 3,000% increase in donations. Even the supposed culture war victories of 2021 existed only in a strange, rightwing metaverse. The Common Sense Group of Conservative MPs, with the help of its allies in the press, has successfully convinced millions that the National Trust has been taken over by woke radicals and had been punished by its membership who had abandoned it in droves. Yet none of that was true. The illusion that such events had taken place was generated by some of the most dishonest reporting of recent years. Yet the only tangible long-term effect of the attacks on the trust has been the formation of a campaign group dedicated to saving it from non-existent threats. Its website largely consists of links to the same inaccurate articles that led to its formation, in an endless loop of falsehood and fury. The ineptitude of the culture wars reflects the fact that there is no deeper philosophy behind them. They are not fought in order to achieve some sort of cultural victory, or to defend, but merely to win elections. Target selection has been clumsy because the groups targeted are merely those against whom it was believed anger might be manufactured and then manipulated. With no objective or outcome in mind, the culture wars are a forever-war, a conflict that can end only if the electoral coalitions they were invented to forge can no longer be assembled. Launched out of cynicism and executed incompetently, the culture wars are nonetheless corrosive and dangerous. The person who best captured that reality in 2021 was the Conservative peer Baroness Warsi who, in a tweet directed at the home secretary, Priti Patel, wrote: “It’s time to stop the culture wars that are feeding division. Dog whistles win votes but destroy nations.”  David Olusoga is a historian and broadcaster",Opinion/Opinion,"Culture warriors sallied forth, only to be defeated by their own ineptitude | David Olusoga",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/26/culture-warriors-sallied-forth-only-to-be-defeated-by-their-own-ineptitude
12/26/2021,"There are two fundamental truths that I’ve learned during my time in politics. First, the best leaders are those who see politics in the longer term, can look around corners and shut out the day-to-day noise. Second, incompetent, tired and sleazy governments lose elections. I vividly remember the first time I typed “one rule for them” in a press release. It was the evening of Friday 22 May 2020. Britain was in lockdown, the best thing on television was the 5pm press conference and it was only seven weeks since my then boss, Keir Starmer, had been elected Labour leader.  At 8pm, the Mirror and the Guardian revealed that Dominic Cummings had broken lockdown rules. Within minutes, my phone lit up with every working journalist wanting Labour’s response. I scanned Pippa Crerar’s article in the Mirror and spotted the perfect line from someone in Durham: “It’s one rule for Dominic Cummings and one rule for the rest of us.” I tapped out Labour’s response, spent a worthless 10 minutes trying to get hold of any politicians to put their name to it, cleared it with colleagues and issued: “The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings.” The next day the story was everywhere. The outrage was real and the sentiment – first uttered by a member of the public in Durham (and if you’re reading, I owe you a beer) – was being shared by the British people and repeated everywhere. We captured that message and hammered it home relentlessly. In attack videos, Starmer’s clips and press statements. What happened to Cummings next is well documented. However, that incident introduced a potent dividing line that could be drawn between Labour’s new leadership and Boris Johnson’s Conservatives. Why? Because one rule for them was not a one-off. It was a pattern of behaviour that happened time and again, exposed by some outstanding journalism and pursed with vigour by the shadow cabinet and my old colleagues. The Conservatives believed then, as they do now, that they were above the rules and even the law. Contrast that with a new Labour leader who built a career defending the rule of law and prosecuted politicians who broke it. It seems obvious now, but at the time there was criticism of Labour’s focus on sleaze. Some argued that it was “priced in” with Johnson. That the British people didn’t care or didn’t notice. That was wrong for three reasons. First, people do care. The public reaction to Cummings and the recent Downing Street revelations come from a very British sense of fairness and dislike for hypocrisy. Second, Johnson has never been universally popular. His personal ratings during the 2019 election campaign were lower than Theresa May’s in 2017. And third, the political impact of the vaccine at the start of the year was hugely underestimated. Talk of the “vaccine bounce” in January was more than just expectation management before local elections. If the government could lift restrictions, reopen the pubs and deliver a successful vaccine programme, then it would be rewarded at the ballot box. I would be lying if I said I didn’t question my instincts at times, especially after the Hartlepool byelection, or reflect on our mistakes in the first year. However, politics is a marathon, not a sprint. It takes more than one scandal or one bad headline to turn the public against their government. It is a cumulative effect. Cummings, “cash for favours”, cronyism, the Owen Paterson affair and the Downing Street parties have collectively damaged this administration’s standing. Poll after poll now shows Labour are ahead, Johnson’s ratings are down and the government is seen as incompetent. Voters might have given Johnson’s government the benefit of the doubt but now they don’t – and that’s a difficult position to recover from. My former colleagues have reason to end the year feeling optimistic, while knowing all too well that nothing can be taken for granted. As quickly as the polls go up, they can go down again. Arguably, British politics is more volatile today than it has ever been. And the Conservatives are the world’s most successful political party for a reason: when they need to change, they change. Many people know why they won’t vote Conservative, but are still asking why they should vote Labour. Tarnishing Johnson’s reputation is not enough. To win in two years’ time, Labour needs to go after the Conservative brand and regain trust on the central issue of the next 12 months and, I suspect, the next election – the economy. There is a strong argument to be made about the Conservatives’ economic record: high tax, low pay and low growth. The rises in inflation, interest rates, tax and energy bills will only make this more compelling. Labour must pursue this, while communicating that it is the party of economic growth. For most voters, the questions they ask at the ballot box are straightforward. Do this lot know what they are doing? Do they have some good ideas? Would I trust them with my money and the security of myself and my family? How Starmer responds to these questions will take time to cut through, but by staying focused on the long term, rather than chasing headlines, his position can grow from strength to strength. And if Labour is ever looking for a good soundbite, I suggest asking someone from Durham.
