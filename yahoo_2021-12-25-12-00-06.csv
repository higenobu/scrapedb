12/25/2021,"Gay Brazilian Olympic diver Ian Matos died earlier this week following a non-COVID-related lung infection. He was 32. Matos had spent the last two months in the hospital fighting the infection until his death on December 21, according to The Independent. The diver won three bronze medals in the 2010 South American Games. He placed eighth in the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro where he competed in the men’s synchronized three-meter springboard with his diving partner Luiz Outerelo. “We are profoundly saddened to have received the news of the premature death of the Olympic diver Ian Matos, aged just 32,” Brazil’s Olympic Committee said in a statement, according to the outlet. “Team Brazil acknowledges his contribution to the evolution of the discipline.” “Our sincere condolences to his family and friends,” the statement continued. The Olympian had sought medical care due to an infection in his throat that eventually spread throughout his body, reports British tabloid newspaper The Sun. Matos came out in 2014. The diver lost some sponsors afterward. He previously said that it was Tom Daley’s coming out in 2013 that inspired him to do the same. Matos also said that he wanted to live free without concerns of people finding out about his relationships or the clubs he went to. “From a young age, I knew I was gay, but it was here that I got to live my sexuality,” Matos said at the time, referring to his new home of Rio, OutSports reports. In 2014, the climate for queer athletes was very different than today. During the 2016 Rio Games, a then-record-breaking 56 athletes were out. In last summer’s Tokyo Olympics there are at least 186 out athletes.",World/The Advocate,Gay Olympic Diving Star Ian Matos Is Dead at 32,https://news.yahoo.com/gay-olympic-diving-star-ian-170050024.html
12/25/2021,"TOKYO (Reuters) - It's a bus, it's a train, it's a DMV! The world's first dual-mode vehicle, equally at home on road and rail, is set to make its public debut on Saturday in the town of Kaiyo in Japan's Tokushima prefecture. The DMV looks like a minibus and runs on normal rubber tyres on the road. But when it arrives at an interchange, steel wheels descend from the vehicle's underbelly onto the rail track, effectively turning it into a train carriage. The train wheels lift the front tyres off the track while the rear wheels stay down to propel the DMV onto the railway. The CEO of Asa Coast Railway company, which operates the DMVs, said the vehicles could help small towns like Kaiyo with an ageing and shrinking population, where local transport companies struggle to make a profit. ""This (DMV) can reach the locals (as a bus), and carry them onto the railway as well,"" CEO Shigeki Miura told Reuters on Friday. ""Especially in rural areas with an ageing population, we expect it to be a very good form of public transport."" The DMV can carry up to 21 passengers and runs at a speed of 60km/h (37 mph) on rail tracks and can go as fast as around 100km/h (62 mph) on public roads, Asa Coast Railway said. Powered by diesel fuel, the small fleet of vehicles, which come in different colours, will run along part of the coast of Shikoku island in southern Japan, connecting several small towns and offering passengers attractive seaside scenery. Miura said he hoped the project would encourage railway fans from around Japan to visit. (Reporting by Reuters TV; Writing by Gareth Jones; Editing by Philippa Fletcher)",World/Reuters,Bus or train?
