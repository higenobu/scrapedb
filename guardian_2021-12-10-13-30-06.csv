12/10/2021,"An editorial in a Chinese state-run news website has suggested Communist party members are obliged to have three children for the good of the country, as Beijing seeks to address plummeting birthrates. The editorial, which was first published last month, went viral this week and drew sharp reaction from Chinese internet users, with millions of shares, views and comments. As the wave of reaction grew, the original article disappeared from the website.  The piece, published by a state media outlet called China Reports Network, said every member of the ruling party – of which there are about 95 million – “should shoulder the responsibility and obligation of the country’s population growth and act on the three-child policy”. “No party member should use any excuse, objective or personal, to not marry or have children, nor can they use any excuse to have only one or two children,” it said. The post appears to have been deleted but screenshots have been widely shared, and associated hashtags reportedly viewed millions of times. China is facing a demographic crisis with an ageing population and declining birthrates. More than 18% of the population is aged over 60, according to the 2020 census. Figures released by the country’s national bureau of statistics in November showed there were 8.5 births per 1,000 people in 2020, the first time in decades that the figure has fallen below 10. In 1978, the figure was more than 18 per 1,000. The CCP has implemented a range of measures in response, including relaxing long-held limits on having children, easing the costs associated with education and child rearing, subsidies for second and third children, and introducing mandatory “cooling off” periods for divorces, but they have had limited impact. The one-child policy was formally ended in 2016, and replaced by a two-child limit on most Chinese couples, until this year when it was lifted again to three. However young Chinese people continue to say the high cost of living and pressures of long working hours are obstacles to having children. “Although the three-child policy has come out, many people don’t have the conditions, ability, money, or time to take care of children, especially for women, who have to go home early, and this will make more companies not want to hire women!” said one commenter on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like platform. “Shouldn’t society be balanced in development? When does it become a mandatory rule to have three children?” Another said: “I‘m just an ordinary person. My time, energy and money only allow me to raise a child in the future. Most party members are also ordinary people.” Some warned that the editorial’s message could harm people’s faith in the party. “‘Party members take the lead’ has always been our party’s fine tradition, which has withstood many tests of history,” said one commenter. “The impact of this bad public opinion, like other public opinions, could easily change from accusations against the China Reports Network to resistance to the three-child policy and shaken trust in the government.”",News/World news,China: editorial says Communist party members must have three children,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/china-editorial-says-communist-party-members-must-have-three-children
12/10/2021,"Joe Biden has launched his virtual Summit for Democracy with a warning that democratic rights and norms are under threat around the world, including in the US. Facing video links with 80 world leaders arrayed on two oversize electronic panels, the US president said: “This is an urgent matter on all our parts, in my view, because the data we’re seeing is largely pointing in the wrong direction.”  Biden cited studies that found that global freedom has now been in retreat for 15 consecutive years and that more than half of all democracies experienced a decline in the past decade. He acknowledged that one of those countries in democratic decline was his own. Since the November 2020 elections – the result of which is still not accepted by many supporters of the loser, Donald Trump – voting rights have been under assault from Republicans on the state level, where gerrymandering is still rife, carried out by both Republicans, and to a lesser extent, Democrats. Biden has been accused by American progressives of hosting a global summit while not doing enough to combat democratic backsliding at home. In New York, activists staged a “funeral for democracy” outside the United Nations, in protest of US voter suppression laws. Opening the two-day summit, Biden announced a string of initiatives aimed at giving concrete support to civil rights where they are most embattled, with a total spend of $424m. Some of that money will go to independent media in places where they are under threat, through a fund to be run by “leading international media experts”. The US Agency for International Development (USaid) will also establish a global “defamation defence fund” to provide liability coverage for investigative journalists against what Biden described as “nuisance lawsuits designed to prevent them from doing their vital work around the world”. Another focus on Biden’s pro-democracy initiative is combating corruption, and USaid will run a series of projects to monitor and target corruption networks and protect whistleblowers, civil society groups and others fighting corruption in their home countries. On the eve of the summit, the White House put out a fact sheet on what the administration was doing to shore up democratic norms in the US, including doubling the number of voting rights attorneys in the justice department and improving access to voter registration. The list included few substantive actions directly connected to protecting access to the ballot. Most notably, the White House and Senate Democrats have failed to pass two important pieces of voting rights legislation stalled in Congress. A section on voting rights, for example, mentioned the way that some federal agencies were making it easier to vote, a welcome development to voting advocates, but unlikely to have widespread effect. The release also mentioned that the justice department had issued guidance, essentially an explanation of what the law says, on existing laws. That kind of limited action, critics say, is outmatched by Republicans’ staggering effort to draw distorted political districts, enact sweeping new voting restrictions, and take more partisan control of election administration in many states. “You have to be kidding me,” tweeted James Slattery, a lawyer with the Texas Civil Rights Project. He described the fact sheet as “minor tweaks on the edges of the problem”. On the first day of the summit, a watchdog group, Civicus Monitor, reported that nine out of 10 of the world’s population live in countries where civic freedoms are severely restricted. Its report downgraded the democratic standing of 13 countries, including Belgium, Czech Republic and Poland, who were invited to the summit. Hungary was the only EU country not to receive an invitation. Across the rest of Europe, Serbia and Kosovo were invited, but Bosnia and Herzegovina was not, causing consternation in Sarajevo. An invitation to Taiwan outraged China, although it did not attend as a sovereign state. The Russian and Chinese ambassadors to Washington published a joint commentary in the National Interest, denouncing the Biden administration for adopting a divisive “cold-war mentality”, and claiming that their authoritarian states were simply other models of democracy. Pakistan pulled out of the summit on Thursday, in a moment that was abruptly announced by the foreign ministry, without giving a reason. A source at the ministry of foreign affairs in Islamabad said that Pakistan is not taking part in it, as China was not invited. Since the Taliban took power in Afghanistan, Islamabad has been treated coolly by Washington. Biden has yet to telephone the prime minister, Imran Khan. The decision was celebrated by the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Lijian Zhao, who said on Twitter: ‘Pakistan declined to attend the democracy summit. A real iron brother!’",News/US news,‘An urgent matter’: Biden warns democracy is under threat at summit,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/09/joe-biden-summit-for-democracy
