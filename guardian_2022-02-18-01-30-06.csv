2/18/2022,"Ministers are stopping supplies of coronavirus tests to universities in England, in the first case of ending the mass distribution of free lateral flow testing kits before dropping all remaining Covid restrictions. Universities are currently advised that students and staff on campus should take lateral flow tests (LFTs) twice a week, even if they do not have coronavirus symptoms. But the contract to supply the kits, through NHS test and trace and the UK Health Security Agency, will be terminated on Friday and not renewed.  The move comes as the cabinet is said to be split over Covid strategy and the future of testing, with the Treasury pushing to end mass testing as a cost-saving measure, while the health secretary, Sajid Javid, wants to retain some free testing to aid community surveillance of the virus. A government spokesperson said: “No decisions have been made on the provision of free testing. Everyone can continue to get free tests, including university students and staff who can order from the government website or their local pharmacy.” Higher education leaders were only informed of the surprise decision on Wednesday. Universities also appear to have been told they cannot distribute any remaining stocks of LFTs past the end of this week. Alistair Jarvis, the chief executive of Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors and college leaders, said: “The ending of the legal agreement which allows universities to hand out lateral flow testing kits to students and staff ahead of the confirmation that all remaining Covid restrictions in England is hard to understand. “We are asking government for urgent clarification that universities can continue to distribute test kits from the supplies they have on campus. This makes sense when universities have kits which would otherwise go to waste and while there is still demand from students and staff this term.” Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, accused the government of “playing fast and loose” with the safety of staff and students on campus, and said the decision could jeopardise in-person teaching. “This approach is reckless and may lead to Covid outbreaks being undetected until it is far too late to limit infections. It is also completely irresponsible for the government to make this change at such short notice,” Grady said. “Ministers must explain how employers are supposed to ensure campuses remain safe when testing is a key health and safety control measure. They must also commit to not abandoning free PCR testing for symptomatic cases. University staff and students need these reassurances urgently.” The government spokesperson said: “We continue to encourage people to use rapid tests when they need them.” The Guardian revealed this week that the Treasury was seeking to cut the budget for coronavirus provisions by up to 90%, including an end to distributing LFTs for asymptomatic testing from March.",News/World news,Ministers to stop supply of free Covid tests to universities in England,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/ministers-stop-supply-free-covid-tests-universities-england
2/18/2022,"Air pollution is a social justice issue, the mayor of London has said, as he convened a summit of regional and national health leaders to tackle toxic emissions that are damaging the health of Londoners. “For me the issue is very simple: it’s one of social justice,” Sadiq Khan said, opening the meeting at the Royal College of Physicians in London. “It’s the poorest people, least likely to own a car, least likely to cause the toxic air problems, who are most likely to suffer the consequences.”  Khan was joined for the summit by Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical officer, the environment minister, Jo Churchill, and Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, whose daughter Ella became the first person in the UK to have air pollution listed as a cause of death at her inquest. “Look at the evidence,” he said. “It’s the poorest Londoners are least likely to own a car who suffer the worst consequences from toxic air.“You’re more likely to suffer the adverse consequences of air pollution if you’re black, Asian or minority ethnic, if you’re not a car owner. “In outer London, where the ULEZ currently doesn’t go to, there are far more deaths where air pollution has a causative impact; 4,000 premature deaths more in outer London. Poorest Londoners are suffering the worst consequences. So that’s why it’s really important we understand this is an issue of social justice.” The summit has come in the week of the ninth anniversary of the death of nine-year-old Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who died in 2013 following an asthma attack after years of poor health caused by pollution on the busy road in Lewisham, south-east London, where she lived. The summit was focused on ensuring Londoners are aware of the health impacts of air pollution, including via more targeted “air quality alerts” on the most polluted days. Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah called for a public awareness campaign around air pollution, including stricter rules on cars idling with their engines running. “It’s going to cost money but it will save lives, so this is all about saving lives. We need to be very bold, and we need to be very loud,” she said. “The coroner’s inquest showed without a doubt that air pollution from the traffic near our home contributed to Ella’s severe asthma, and that without it Ella would still be alive today,” Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said. “The coroner set out clear recommendations on how the UK’s national and local governments and health professionals can prevent future deaths like Ella’s. In London, eight to 12 children die from asthma every year. That is unacceptable, and it’s time we act to save their lives.” Existing measures, including the controversial low-traffic neighbourhoods that have been rolled out across London, were “not working”, Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said. “I was coming today, I was sitting on the train, and I saw the new TfL stat: on the A21 now, traffic has risen,” she said. “And I thought ‘what?’ But then, this is what’s going on, if you shut one place it just moves it on somewhere else. “When you come out you notice it, all the main roads are congested. I wouldn’t like to drive in central London, but there are people who also live here, we forget that; people live here and they breathe this every day, people have to go to work. So for some … it is not a choice.” Whitty said the problem of air pollution was big, but solvable through a combination of regulation and engineering. “This is a big problem and what Rosamund has done so successfully is put a human face on the problem,” he said. But he emphasised that this problem faces people from every walk of life. “It’s not just a problem for children with asthma.”",News/Environment,"Poorest Londoners most at risk from toxic air, Sadiq Khan says",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/17/poorest-londoners-most-at-risk-from-toxic-air-sadiq-khan-says
2/18/2022,"It’s a long time since Labour had a genuine feel for supporting communities (Letters, 9 February; Politicians may have forgotten about ‘community’, but British people haven’t, 7 February). As a member of a ministerial local government sounding board in the early 2000s, I was asked to imagine what the second stage of “double devolution”, from local government to communities, might look like. At the end of the presentation, a senior voice of Labour local government turned to the minister and said: “Our job is difficult enough already. For God’s sake, don’t make us work with communities as well.” That crushing contempt for communities, and fear of not being in control has not gone away. Lisa Nandy, Jon Cruddas, Steve Reed and others behind Labour Together’s pamphlet Labour’s Covenant openly admit that Labour speaks well about devolution when in opposition but clings to centralised power when in office. They tell a good story about a better relationship between communities and the state, but it could have been written by Danny Kruger, Jerome Mayhew and others at the New Social Covenant Unit for their Trusting the People report, launched at the Tory party conference last October.  Listen up, you Covenanters: this is beyond party politics. Labour must work together and with communities to build a cross-party consensus for a lasting devolved settlement across the union. Together, we need to remake our politics at the level at which we can all recognise that we have a shared responsibility to agree how we are housed, fed, employed and kept warm.

2/18/2022,"A massacre is occurring. More than 35,000 healthy British pigs have been slaughtered and buried on farms since September, with an estimated 200,000 languishing in a backlog. The reason is that abattoirs lack the staff to process them, largely due to Britain’s exit from the pan-European labour market. In October, the environment department offered 800 six-month visas for foreign butchers. But it insisted they go through its laborious scheme for seasonal workers: barely 100 turned up. Whitehall also refuses to curb imports of European pork – which now makes up 60% of the UK market and rising. To the National Pig Association, Brexit means buy from Europe.  For pig farmers, we can read apple growers, flower producers, fishing fleets, road hauliers, house builders, medicine suppliers, care home managers – a whole range of workers on the frontline of Britain’s economy. All have benefited in the past from the open market in European labour. All must now lobby Whitehall for permits, visas, waivers and, if not, compensation. Hundred-page documents must accompany every food convoy to and from Dover and Belfast, where hours of tailbacks quietly rot produce. You might think all this comes from some statist socialist regime. Yet it is the brainchild of the right wing of the Conservative party, now in government. Ironically, the last such seismic distortion of the free market was also instigated by a lapsed libertarian Tory, Edward Heath, with his statutory controls on incomes and prices to combat inflation in 1972. This saw Whitehall officials invading company offices and vetting individual payslips. Those officials are now peering into food containers and poring over job advertisements, exerting the full force of their regulatory zeal. Jobs must be categorised by specialism, shortage, pay and length of stay. Vast Whitehall charts must be mapping labour flows. The Home Office aversion to foreigners has bred a “hostile environment” culture. At the end of last year, private care homes were forced to sack 50,000 unvaccinated staff. To pretend to compensate, the government then offered care homes extra visas. It turned out they could be only for one year – despite the essence of care being continuity. As for getting a visa, it is said to take a minimum of 16 weeks. I care about elderly people more than I do pigs, but the principle is the same. Both are victims not – repeat not – of the UK’s decision to leave the European Union. They are victims of Boris Johnson’s subsequent decision, to aid him in toppling Theresa May, to interpret Brexit as requiring Britain to depart the world’s most efficient and benign economic entity, the single market. This had been in large part the creation in 1986 of the right’s hero, Margaret Thatcher, to honour her free-market principles. Leaving the EU had some arguments for it. Leaving the single market had none. “Soft” Brexit within that market would have been far been easier to negotiate. Leaving it has meant wrecked supply chains and terminated scientific collaboration. It has undermined recruitment patterns and destabilised Northern Ireland. It has crippled the fish industry and impeded billions of pounds of UK trade. Its consequences have wavered between nuisance and disaster. Brexit has seen a consummation of the very thing Tories are supposed to hate – bureaucracy. Whitehall officials used to be accused of “gold plating” Brussels regulations. “Taking back control” has licensed their wildest dreams. Brexit is estimated to have required a civil service army of 50,000 new officials, more than the entire central bureaucracy of the EU in Brussels. The latest addition to this apparat is Jacob Rees-Mogg calling himself the “Brexit opportunities” minister. His first act has been desperate, to “implore” readers of the Sun to tell him what opportunities they could think of. Rees-Mogg is now advocating an Institute of Economic Affairs suggestion to boost trade with other countries by abolishing non-tariff barriers and “recognising [their] regulations, without requiring reciprocity, starting with the EU”. Why should they negotiate at all? Surely this negates the whole point of “taking back control”. But then the government is also desperate to reopen trade talks with the US and China. The idea that Britain might “control” such talks is beyond naive. The battered band of Brexiters is now seen as wandering in a hostile desert, mystified at why their promised land has failed to materialise. Former European partners were supposed to come crawling to London begging for business. We were told: “They need us more than we need them.” But Europe’s other nations have no interest in rewarding separatism of any sort. A Britain divided, weakened and ill-led is merely the subject of scorn and ridicule. Chaos at Dover is an excellent advertisement for European union. Britain’s position as an island has to be one that trades openly with the mainland. Sooner or later, the free movement of goods, services, capital and labour will have to be restored, however painfully. It would greatly help if Labour’s Keir Starmer stopped vacillating and committed himself to that objective, as should candidates for Johnson’s succession. No, this is not revoking Brexit or rejoining the EU. It is just embracing sanity.

2/18/2022,"Air pollution may affect semen quality, specifically sperm motility — the ability of sperm to swim in the right direction — according to a new study analysing the sperm of over 30,000 men in China. The research, published today in the journal JAMA Networks, also suggests that the smaller the size of the polluting particles in the air, the greater the link with poor semen quality.  “Our findings suggest that smaller particulate matter size fractions may be more potent than larger fractions in inducing poor sperm motility,” wrote the authors of the paper. The researchers believe that these findings highlight yet another reason for the need to reduce exposure to air pollution among men in their reproductive age. Researchers have long been trying to establish whether there’s a link between air pollution and sperm quality, but it’s been unclear whether the former has adverse health effects on male fertility because the results from studies are often inconsistent among themselves and complicated to put into perspective. There does appear to be reason to believe that pollution may negatively affect fertility in general for the whole of the population, as suggested in this international literature review published in December 2021. Researchers at the School of Medicine of Tongji University in Shanghai looked at data records from a total of 33,876 men from 340 Chinese cities, aged 34 on average, with a varied degree of exposure to air pollution among them, and whose wives got pregnant through assisted reproduction technology with their sperm between January 2013 and December 2019. They then looked for patterns between semen quality in relation to whether the participants had been exposed to amounts of particulate matter smaller in diameter than 2.5 micrometres, between 2.5 and 10 micrometres, and 10 micrometres, in various key moments of the 90 days before their visit to the hospital for semen ejaculation. To establish the quality of the semen, the researchers concentrated on factors such as sperm count, concentration, and sperm motility. Although the researchers couldn’t find a significant link between air pollution and sperm quality in terms of sperm count or concentration — they did find that the more a participant was exposed to smaller particulate matter, the lower both the progressive and the total sperm motility was. Progressive sperm motility is the sperm’s ability to swim forward, while total sperm motility simply refers to the sperm’s ability to swim in general. Specifically, when exposed to particulate matter smaller in diameter than 2.5 micrometres. there was an estimated decrease in sperm motility of 3.6%, while when exposed to particulate matter of 10 micrometres in diameter, there was 2.44% less sperm motility. Meaning that it’s possible that different size fractions of particulate matter might have differing effects on semen quality, maybe because the smaller the particulate matter, the more likely it is to travel deeper into the human lungs. The data indicates that the effects of pollution are more prominent when exposure takes place during the initial part of the 90 days of sperm creation — the one called spermatogenesis — rather than the other two phases. This, in turn, may mean that particulate matter affects sperm on a genetic level, according to the researchers, but these are just speculations, and there’s more research to be done in this area. “The possibility of a link between air pollution and semen quality has been suggested in a number of studies over the years, although not all of them have agreed with this conclusion,” said Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield, who was not involved in the research. “This paper adds to the evidence base suggesting the link is real, and is impressive because it uses semen quality data from over 30,000 men.” “But the level of decline in sperm motility seems to be quite low,” said Pacey, stressing that correlation is not causation. He noted that the paper failed to provide any information about the morphology, shape and size of the sperm, which made it impossible to determine whether pollution might be responsible for deformation of sperm and that’s why their motility is decreased, or whether there were other reasons. According to Pacey, it is important to take these findings with a pinch of salt. Although the data suggests that pollution may have a negative effect on sperm mobility, there still isn’t enough information to infer whether this can have a significant clinical effect at large, and result in the overall decrease of the ability of men in high pollution areas to become fathers. More research out in the field might help answer that question with more certainty in the future.",News/Environment,"Air pollution may affect sperm quality, says study",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/17/air-pollution-may-affect-sperm-quality-says-study
2/18/2022,"It is widely accepted as one of life’s bleak but unavoidable facts: as we get older, our brains get slower. But now a study, based on data from more than 1 million people, suggests that mental processing speed remains almost constant until the age of 60. The analysis puts perceived reductions in speed down to people becoming more cautious as they get older. This could account for the large body of research that has concluded that mental processing speed peaks at about the age of 20 and undergoes a steady decline from that point onwards.  “Our finding is encouraging, as our results show that average levels in mental speed in contexts demanding fast and forced decisions do not decline until relatively late in the lifespan,” said Dr Mischa von Krause, of Heidelberg University and first author of the work. The study, published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour, used data from 1,185,882 participants, aged 10 to 80 years, in Harvard’s Project Implicit, an online tool that has been used to collect data and educate people about biases they hold on gender, race and other characteristics. Participants are required to sort words into positive and negative categories, while also assigning image to racial categories. The test is primarily designed to measure the strength of a person’s associations between race (in this case black or white people) and evaluations (represented by positive or negative words), but the latest analysis simply used the age of the participants, their response times and accuracy. The data showed, as previous studies have done, that average time to give a correct response peaked at about 20 years. However, the researchers argue that this metric also captures how cautious a person is in delivering their answer and also their basic motor reaction speeds. By using machine learning, the researchers aimed to extract more information about these two hidden factors from patterns in the data. For instance, if someone consistently responded more slowly, regardless of the difficulty of a given question, the model might be more likely to attribute this to slow motor responses. The analysis suggested that 20-year-olds were quickest because they were the most willing to trade accuracy for speed. The researchers concluded that the purely mechanical part of the response (how fast a person sees the question and taps the keyboard) was quickest in those aged 14-16. Mental processing speed appeared to peak about age 30, and declined only very slightly between 30 and 60. Participants also made fewer mistakes as they became older, at least until the age of about 60. Dr Joshua Hartshorne, a psychologist at Boston College who was not involved in the latest work, said the machine learning method used was impressive and would prompt psychologists to reconsider some earlier findings based simply on response times. “This joins a body of work suggesting that the way mental abilities change throughout life is complicated and we don’t really know what’s going on,” he said. “But whatever’s going on, it’s definitely not that we peak at 20 and go downhill from there.” Von Krause said the work raised the suggestion that people may excel at different tasks depending on their age. “Obviously, there are real-life tasks where it is crucial to avoid mistakes, such as in a medical diagnosis, while in other tasks, such as avoiding an obstacle on the road, speed is more important,” she said. However, she added that, within certain limits, people were likely to be able to adapt their decision-making style to suit the demands of a situation.",News/Science,"Brains do not slow down until after age of 60, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/17/brains-do-not-slow-down-until-after-age-of-60-study-finds
2/18/2022,"It is not only the prying eyes of rural neighbours that make Portia Coughlan (Denise Gough) feel trapped. In Marina Carr’s blistering drama from 1996, the anti-heroine of the title feels bound for life to her dead twin, Gabriel, and to the Belmont river where he drowned, aged 15. Everything else in Portia’s life – her wealthy husband Raphael (Marty Rea), lover Damus (Fionn Ó Lionsaigh) and young children – is overshadowed by her obsession with Gabriel as the missing part of herself. In Caroline Byrne’s new production, the bare interior of Portia’s expensive home ominously suggests a deep burial chamber, where we first see Portia on the morning of her 30th birthday. Apathetic and drained, she is already working through a bottle of brandy.  One of three plays described as Carr’s Midlands trilogy (including The Mai and By the Bog of Cats) Portia Coughlan’s preoccupation with fate, self-destructive desire and the spectral presence of the dead takes it into the realm of the mythic. Yet, though not written as a slice of realism, it touches on subjects that are still highly disturbing 26 years after its premiere: from sexual secrets passed on through generations, to incest and in-breeding; from misogyny to vicious social prejudice. Harbouring resentments, Portia’s parents and grandmother (Derbhle Crotty, Liam Carney and Barbara Brennan) dig up the most hurtful things they can say to each other. In a production that tends to over-signal, Byrne’s direction of these ensemble scenes is in need of toning down, while set designer Chiara Stephenson’s rendering of the mysterious river as a narrow overflow channel seems visually awkward. Carr’s decision to kill off Portia early on is a bold stroke that affords her the freedom to play intriguingly with chronology in the more subtle second half. Here, lighter moments in the pub with her aunt and uncle (Anna Healy and Gary Murphy) bring relief from the extreme bleakness, with Gough showing the softer side of Portia. Likewise, in a compelling scene where she tries to connect with the pained Raphael, we see the woman Portia might have become if she had ever had a chance.

2/18/2022,"Obviously it’s a cliche, but “be prepared” is the best advice ahead of Storm Eunice, which could bring gusts of up to 90mph as well as heavy snow and blizzards. Power cuts caused by fallen trees are highly likely and there are a few straightforward things which people can do in preparation, Northumberland fire and rescue service said.  That includes checking you’ve got batteries for torches and radios. Have some food in that doesn’t need cooking. Charge your mobile phone. Check in with elderly neighbours. If power is down then turn off electrical appliances at the socket in case everything comes on when you’re not there or asleep. Torches are safer than candles. Most councils will have a page on their website giving information about storms and who to contact if the power is out or you need to report a fallen tree. The advice from road agencies and travel companies is for people not to go out on Friday unless they absolutely need to. “For anyone who has to set out, we recommend sticking to major roads and avoiding exposed and coastal routes,” said Rod Dennis, a spokesperson for RAC Breakdown. “It’s also vital to reduce speeds and to take extra care when passing high-sided vehicles so as not to get buffeted off course.” If there is ice or snow then be gentle on the accelerator. If the car skids “it’s best to gently steer into the direction of the skid and wait for the car to regain grip. Avoid the temptation to stamp on the brake.” During previous storms there have been alarming reports of cats being lifted in the air and dogs being swept away. Amy Ockelford, a spokesperson for the RSPCA, said: “We’re urging pet owners to keep an eye on the forecast where they live and to plan ahead to ensure the safety of their animals.” Tips to keep pets safe include planning dog walks around the worst of the weather and avoiding dangerous locations. Wear reflective clothing. If the dog is old or feels the cold get them a jacket to keep warm. For cats, ensure they have access to the house or a warm, inside area where they can escape the weather. If conditions are extreme consider keeping the cat inside. It’s not just pets, the RSPCA says.

2/18/2022,"A damning independent report into race equality at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) has found racial discrimination against staff of colour and a dominant Eurocentric approach, and highlighted an absence of senior leaders from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. The report, written by Prof Jason Arday of the University of Glasgow, was commissioned following an open letter from the BAME staff network in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder in 2020.  The 150 signatories of the letter raised concerns that the LSTM, the world’s first institute dedicated to the research and teaching of tropical medicine, had been slow to acknowledge structural racism and called for action to confront the institution’s colonial past. The letter also included testimonies providing examples of perceived discrimination and described a culture that was demeaning to African colleagues. The LSTM, founded in 1898 by a shipping merchant with wide-reaching investments in colonial Africa, has about 620 staff, 81% of whom are white. The university’s first tropical medicine director was awarded the Nobel prize in 1902 for identifying the role of the mosquito in the transmission of malaria, and now benefits from hundreds of millions in research grants and teaches 800 students. Arday interviewed 45 staff members, and ran focus groups with staff and students, although the report highlights that “only a fraction of staff of colour who engaged in individual interviews chose to engage in focus groups, suggesting a lack of trust and/or fear of speaking out”. The report details “issues of racially discriminatory behaviour dismissed by line managers” and staff being overlooked, with the perception that the “infrastructure facilitated a nepotistic pathway”. It found the “current approach towards progression and promotion left many respondents feeling completely ostracised”. Arday highlighted the high number of staff of colour employed using fixed-term contracts, the disproportionate impact on women of colour, and “poor reporting and management of racism”. The report called for the diversification of academic staff to improve learning experiences of students, aspects of which were “sometimes regarded as a ‘colonial exchange’ which centred upon ‘narrow western conceptions of medicine’”. Dr Rinki Deb, the co-chair of the LSTM race equality advisory panel and BAME staff network, thanked “brave colleagues for engaging in the review process and sharing their honest, lived experiences”. “There will be a need for significant change in mindsets and practices within the institution, rebuilding bridges, and investment into sustainable long-term solutions to break barriers,” she said. However, one staff member said many colleagues of colour had disengaged from the process because of the high level of distrust between staff and management. “People have genuinely suffered in the institution – over decades,” they said. In relation to Arday’s decision to not directly quote staff members, citing sensitivity and confidentiality issues, the employee said: “What that doesn’t allow for is the pain of the voices to come through.” They said while many colleagues said they felt sick reading the report, “the leadership don’t feel nausea, they’re feeling good about themselves, and all these initiatives that they’re putting in place. People don’t trust them. “How can it be that it’s the same people who have presided over all this pain for all those years can suddenly overnight become listening and responsive and put the needs of the staff before their perceived needs of the institution?” they added. Prof David Lalloo, the LSTM director, said the institution and board accepted the findings of the review in full and were “completely committed” to addressing the recommendations. “We have a strong desire to do better and be better and are committed to a vision of becoming an actively anti-racist organisation.”",News/Education,Race report delivers damning verdict on Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/17/race-report-delivers-damning-verdict-on-liverpool-school-of-tropical-medicine

2/18/2022,"Imagine distilling your life to fit in just 7 square metres. There would just about be space for a bed, a toilet and shower, a sink, a microwave and some storage. But no room for a kitchen to cook in, decorations, a place to store equipment for hobbies, or to have anyone round to visit. This is life in London’s smallest microflat. Located in a Victorian conversion in Lower Clapton, east London it is thought by its sellers to be the smallest to have gone on the market in the capital. The minimum price set by auctioneers is £50,000, but it is expected to go for more as it was bought for £103,500 in May 2017.  The flat is an example of what experts say is a growing phenomenon of tiny homes, driven by soaring rent and property prices. Microflats are becoming more sought-after and even smaller, they say. The Clapton flat has recently been renovated and has a large window. To maximise space, it has a captain’s bed above storage space and cupboards. The space between the bed and the wall is about wide enough to spread your arms in, and there’s a foldout table for eating or working on. A toilet and shower are in a separate wet room. The owner has already recouped their investment by getting £800 in rent each month. The current tenant lives elsewhere for most of the time and spends just a night or two each week in the flat as it is closer to work. The auction minimum is well below the average deposit for first-time buyers in London, which Halifax calculated at £130,357 in 2020, but Neal Hudson, a housing analyst, warned that first-time buyers should be aware it is not sustainable to live in a tiny flat long-term and that if they are unable to sell they could find themselves stuck. The price is a powerful symbol of how inaccessible housing has become. The TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp recently irked millennials by suggesting they could afford to buy their own homes if they spent less on the gym, easyJet flights, coffee and Netflix. Critics have pointed out that when she bought her first flat, the average home cost £50,000 and measured 73.4 sq m – 10 times bigger than the Clapton flat. Stuart Collar-Brown, the director of My Auction, which is selling the flat, said that although it was the cheapest flat with a long leasehold on the market within a 10-mile radius, he expected it would be bought by an investor rather than a first-time buyer, as high street banks will not lend on properties below 30 sq m. With rental income estimated at about £10,000, investors were likely to be able to recoup the £50,000 outlay within five years, he said. Suitable tenants would not spend much time at home and would be those who were tired of house-sharing but unable to afford more space, or who lived elsewhere and needed a crash pad for work, he said. For instance, doctors or nurses working in nearby Homerton hospital, or workers in the City, given the area’s good transport links to Liverpool Street. In 2019 a 9 sq m flat in another part of Hackney was on the market for £130,000. The estate agents Wild & Co said it received two offers, both below the asking price, and it took 28 viewings to find tenants, who paid £600 a month. Microflats are becoming more popular and their size is shrinking, according to research by Philip Hubbard, a professor of urban studies at Kings’s College London. One in 15 apartments in London fall below the national minimum standard of 37 sq m for a one-bedroom home, while the median size of UK properties below the space standard fell by one square metre to 29 sq m this year. Hubbard recommended that buyers look for flats above 37 sq m since fewer windows and the inability to divide living, working and leisure space take a toll on sleep and mental health, and smaller properties are more expensive per square metre. Julia Rugg, a research fellow at York University’s Centre for Housing Policy, said the Clapton sale reflected the “inflated nature of the housing market in London” and said it would be a “worrying development” if microflats were seen as a solution to housing affordability. “This is accommodation that is barely suitable as a hotel room, and does not constitute sustainable liveable space. The property lacks comfort or amenity and forces reliance on disposable items. The neighbourhood may well be awash with bars and cafes but relying on these for living space makes life very expensive,” she said.",News/UK news,"London’s smallest microflat up for sale at £50,000 for 7 square metres",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/17/londons-smallest-microflat-up-for-sale-at-50000-for-7-square-metres
2/18/2022,"Dr Seuss and (Mr) Potato Head. The Mandalorian and The Muppet Show. These are just some of the many cultural artefacts that have been dragged to the heart of the US’s all-consuming war over “wokeness” in the past year, with furious rightwingers decrying liberals for “cancelling” things they see as insufficiently progressive. Republican-led states have moved to ban schools from teaching “critical race theory”, an academic framework for assessing entrenched societal racism that is not typically taught in schools. Ron DeSantis, the Trump-lite Florida governor, proposed the “Stop Woke” Act, with woke standing for “Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees”.  Oliver Dowden, the Tory party chairman, blundered into this increasingly meaningless word soup on his visit to Washington this week, giving a speech at the rightwing Heritage Foundation identifying “wokeness” as a dire threat to western civilisation. Dowden alluded to modern Maoists who are “obsessing over pronouns” and want to “decolonise mathematics”. “The US and the UK may certainly be very different societies. But we are joined by the same fundamental values,” he said. “Neither of us can afford the luxury of indulging in this painful woke psychodrama.” He sounded downright American, and not for the first time. Dowden has often been in the vanguard of the British government’s halting attempts to start its own “war on woke” in recent years. During his tenure as culture secretary, he condemned the BBC for planning to axe the singing of Rule, Britannia! from the Last Night of the Proms (the BBC blamed Covid then U-turned), said government buildings should fly the union jack more, and moved to put “red wall” voters on the boards of cultural institutions. In his Heritage Foundation address, Dowden condemned the defilement of a statue of Winston Churchill. Much of Dowden’s speech was transparently silly and hypocritical. A society being able to challenge its shibboleths is an act of self-confidence, not the erosion thereof. Complaints about “woke warriors” stifling speech often seek themselves to stifle speech, especially in the US, which is well into the book-banning phase of its Trumpian decline. Even taken on his own terms, though, Dowden was wrong to characterise woke threats to the UK and US as two sides of the same coin. America’s woke wars have mostly stuck new branding on entrenched, decades-old cultural grievances – often thinly veiled expressions of racism and white anxiety – that tend to break down on familiar partisan lines. In many ways, it’s just the new “political correctness gone mad”. The UK, of course, has longstanding institutional racism issues, and countless cultural sores of its own. When Dowden told the Heritage Foundation that the government had told schools that it was “illegal to teach the concept of ‘white privilege’ as though it were undisputed fact”, his audience surely heard a clear echo of the US freakout over critical race theory. In general, America’s culture war discourse is so ingrained that it is impossible to simply uproot it and replant it in Britain, where political life is less structured around hot-button cultural controversies. Sure, people care about patriotic songs and the union jack, often quite a lot. But these symbols aren’t permanent, inflamed points of contention. (Keir Starmer may be keen to emphasise them, but he seems to see them as a post-Corbyn prerequisite for electability, not a finished political offer in and of themselves.) We have tabloids, but we do not have a Fox News mainlining grievance day and night. GB News looks tinpot in comparison. Moreover, the cultural schisms that we do have don’t always reinforce each other. Brexit got nasty, but did not map neatly on to existing divisions. (Dowden voted for Remain.) Covid rules, a key driver of the US culture wars, have not been as viciously polarising here. When Dominic Cummings broke lockdown, he tried to fight his way out of accountability, Trump-style, but was met with a wall of public fury. Ditto Boris Johnson. As of a year ago, nearly 60% of Britons didn’t know what “woke” meant. A roughly contemporaneous poll found the equivalent US figure to be around 30%. It’s easy to oversimplify any transatlantic comparison, and it’s facile to say that culture wars are always a distraction from weightier, kitchen-table issues – culture matters. But the relentless, totalising focus on grievance surely is a distraction. In keeping with their “with or against us” tone, the woke wars, if they are to be effective electorally, need to be an all-or-nothing political strategy. Many US politicians are all in. Most Tories are not. And it’s far from clear that their voters would reward them if they were. In addition to getting Brexit done, increasing living standards has really been the nub of the Tory offer to so-called “red wall” voters, and they will want to see some follow-through at some point. Dowden’s speech went down well at the Heritage Foundation; word for word, it might have gone down quite well in Hartlepool, too. Most British voters, though, need more than a seat on the board of a museum. Jon Allsop is a freelance journalist.
