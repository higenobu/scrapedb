3/31/2022,"The United States men’s national team arrived at the Estadio Nacional de Costa Rica on Wednesday having all but qualified for the 2022 Fifa World Cup. Seated in second place with 25 points with a comfortable advantage on goal difference, a win, draw or loss by anything fewer than six goals would have been enough to get them over the line. Had lightning struck, the worst-case scenario was an intercontinental playoff with New Zealand in June. Redemption for 2017’s failed World Cup qualification felt imminent, but focus on the task at hand never waned in camp. “We still have a job to do” was the refrain echoed from head coach Gregg Berhalter to key players Tyler Adams, Tim Weah and Deandre Yedlin throughout Tuesday’s training. And despite the math that weighed heavily in their favor, Berhalter and co put to rest speculation the team would rotate players or be happy with a draw. The task was qualification, but the manner of qualification mattered. The players conveyed a desire to win, to make a point, to leave a mark, to do what every US team before them had failed to do: win a World Cup qualifying match away in Costa Rica. As for the hosts, the atmosphere was celebratory and hopeful. The bandbox was packed and cheering. After a remarkable run of five wins and one draw in their final six matches, Los Ticos had elbowed their way into qualifying contention. They entered Wednesday’s match poised to snag the fourth-place playoff spot and, no doubt looking forward strategically toward that match, they sat a number of key players, including Joel Campbell and Bryan Oviedo, to guard against potential yellow card accumulation that would sit them out of that one-off in June. The United States out-possessed the Costa Ricans ever so slightly in a scoreless first half. They eclipsed them in free kick and corner accrual, winning seven corners but converting none. They looked threatening in places and did good work getting the ball forward, especially from the right. They held Costa Rica well defensively and were setting the pace of the match. The opening minutes of the second half saw the United States’ best chance on goal. It felt like the moment the Americans would take the lead, capitalizing on the momentum built in the first half and sending the US on their way to make history in qualifying. Miles Robinson was well positioned in front of net looking threatening, where he received a cross and sent it toward net with a header that felt assured to slot in were it not for an incredible save from Keylor Navas. And with that save, the lights went out. Moments later, Costa Rica won a corner on the opposite end of the pitch. Brandon Aguilera took the corner, sending it to Juan Pablo Vargas who catapulted it past Zack Steffen, putting Costa Rica ahead in the 51st. In a match that arguably came down to capitalizing and defending on set pieces, the United States had taken seven corners by then and came away with nothing – and Costa Rica had just converted its third corner into a goal. The momentum shift on the pitch and in the stands was immediate. Eight minutes later, Anthony Contreras snuck in behind Antonee Robinson to tap in Costa Rica’s second goal off another cross. Still fighting, still hoping, Berhalter sent in three subs immediately. Jesus Ferreira, Giovanni Reyna and Shaq Moore entered, joining Luca de la Torre who had gone in at the half as substitutions. But the USA would never quite regain the momentum or control the pace of the match. They won a handful more corners, but again failed to make anything out of them. They pushed the ball forward and kept on the attack, but were slowed by fouls and tight defending. The crowd roared behind the home team, sending the momentum their way. The Los Ticos looked goal-dangerous until the last whistle. The match ended 2-0 in favor of the hosts. Despite the outcome, despite failure to grasp hold of history with their first ever qualifying win in Costa Rica, the United States completed the essential task before them, the one they set out to achieve eight months ago in El Salvador: officially punching their ticket to Qatar 2022.",Sport/Football,USA clinch spot at World Cup finals in Qatar despite Costa Rica defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/30/usmnt-qualify-world-cup-costa-rica-united-states
3/31/2022,"The stereotype that paramedics must be “white, male, of able-body and mind, confident, stoic and the family breadwinner” is preventing women from rising through the ranks of Ambulance Victoria, according to a new report. The second volume of the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission’s inquiry into the emergency service’s culture, released on Thursday, found the stereotype was particularly relevant in the “elite, male-dominated” mobile intensive care (MICA) and air ambulance units. “We heard that across Ambulance Victoria, and in the MICA sub-group particularly, these paramedics are considered to be clinically superior and that ‘macho’ or ‘alpha male’ personalities are common,” the inquiry found. The inquiry was told employees who fit the “rigid paramedic stereotype” were more likely to be considered suitable for opportunities than those who don’t, such as “women and people from diverse backgrounds”. “We heard that women are often viewed as being unsuited to paramedic roles as they are generally assumed to lack or possess less of the physical or emotional strength needed to perform the responsibilities of a paramedic,” the commission said in the report. “It is also assumed that women are, or want to become, mothers/caregivers (irrespective of their individual circumstances or preferences) and therefore will be unable to work full-time or long hours, overnight or on weekends or be on-call, and that they will go on parental leave.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The commission heard employees who don’t fit stereotypical expectations “self-select out” or don’t apply for opportunities because they assume they won’t be successful. About 67% of female employees surveyed by the commission said certain barriers would prevent them from applying for a transfer, promotion or different position. The most common barriers were their work pattern, for instance flexible or part-time work (32.1%), carer or parental responsibilities (26.6%) and sex/gender (22.5%). Meanwhile, of the 60% of men who identified barriers, the most common was that they were unlikely to be successful (21.9%), their location (18.9%) and their work pattern (16.1%). The commission said a requirement within the organisation that employees had to get a personal endorsement from their managers before they applied for a higher position had “facilitated subjective and biased decision-making” and entrenched discrimination. “The endorsement requirement makes certain career advancement opportunities within Ambulance Victoria contingent on fostering relationships, rather than possessing the necessary skills and capabilities,” it said. “This places a significant burden on individuals to cultivate close, positive relationships with their managers and other superiors and undercuts efforts to prioritise equality, fairness and inclusion.” Again, it is women, employees working flexibly and those from diverse or marginalised groups, who are most affected as they aren’t “part of the so-called ‘in crowd’” or “boys club”. “People being tapped on the shoulders for development opportunities seem to always be blokes. The same men seem to get higher duty opportunities. Women are usually overlooked,” one employee told the commission. “You can have a very good résumé, it means absolutely nothing. They’ll pick who they want, it’s notoriously corrupt,” another said. The report made 19 new recommendations on top of 24 that were announced in volume one late last year, which detailed widespread reports of incivility, disrespect, discrimination, sexual harassment, bullying and victimisation in the emergency service.

3/31/2022,"Australia is at risk of serious economic damage and is already suffering fallout from its failure to bring lawyers and other professionals into the anti-money laundering and counter-terror finance (AML-CTF) regime, a Senate committee says. The legal and constitutional affairs references committee, which has been examining the adequacy of Australia’s current AML-CTF regime, said the country was a laggard by international standards and needed to move quickly to avoid being placed on a list of jurisdictions with systemic deficiencies in their laws. It also recommended the government fulfil its longstanding promise to create a register of beneficial ownership that would reveal who really owns assets held through opaque trust or company structures – something Australia’s financial intelligence agency, Austrac, said on Thursday would make it easier to track flows from sanctioned Russian oligarchs. It comes after warnings from experts that Australia’s current laws, which exclude lawyers, real estate agents and other “gatekeeper” professions from laws that force banks and other financial institutions to report large or suspicious transactions, were putting the country at risk of becoming a target for Russian oligarchs seeking a haven from sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at Senate estimates on Thursday, Austrac’s head of intelligence, John Moss, said there were “operational activities under way that we’re involved in that have links to sanctioned entities”, led by federal police. These operations “may include real estate”, he said. Asked by Greens senator Nick McKim if a beneficial ownership register would help, Moss said: “Yes.” The government first promised to bring “designated nonfinancial businesses and professions” (DNFBPs) – a group that includes lawyers, real estate agents, accountants and company service providers – under the AML-CTF umbrella in 2014 but has failed to do so since amid fierce opposition from lawyers, who claim it would impinge on client legal professional privilege. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Austrac’s chief executive, Nicole Rose, told estimates that bringing the professions into the system “absolutely could be of intelligence use”. She said the failure to bring in the reforms, known as “tranche 2”, could be make Australia more attractive as a place for Russian oligarchs to launder money. “I don’t have any concrete evidence that that is particularly occurring, but it could be an area of weakness,” she said. In its report, tabled in parliament on Wednesday, the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee said: “Australia is a laggard on the world stage, one of only three states to fail to enact any regulation in relation to DNFBPs.” The committee, chaired by outgoing Labor senator Kim Carr, said Australia, a founding member of the global standards-setting body the financial action taskforce (FATF), had made repeated promises to bring in “tranche 2”. “The government’s failure to enact tranche 2 reforms call into question these commitments,” the committee said. “It is difficult to ignore the gap between the commonwealth government’s words and its actions.” It said Australia risked being placed on the FATF’s “grey list” of countries subject to increased monitoring – a group that currently includes Syria, Myanmar and South Sudan. This “could cause significant economic harm to Australia”, the committee said. “Regardless of the likelihood of whether that will occur, the real-world consequences are already being felt,” it said in the report. “As a result, Australian banks are being required to go out of their way to prove Australia’s suitability to receive credit. To risk Australia’s reputation and economy in that way is reckless.” It said implementing tranche 2 would take some time. “However, the need for action cannot be ignored, and the government has dragged its feet for too long,” it said. The committee said it recognised arguments from lawyers that bringing them into the AML-CTF reporting regime would compromise client confidentiality. “The committee is of the view that lessons can be learned from jurisdictions where such reforms have been reconciled with legal professional privilege (including the United Kingdom and New Zealand), and where issues have arisen (for example Canada),” it said. It said bringing the professions into the system would vastly increase the number of reports financial intelligence agency Austrac received, raising concerns about its resourcing. “The committee acknowledges the evidence that the development of a robust beneficial ownership register would both mitigate the burden on small business by enhancing and simplifying ‘know your customer’ searches and at the same time would reduce Australia’s vulnerability to money laundering,” the committee said. In 2016, the then-assistant treasurer, Kelly O’Dwyer, promised to introduce a beneficial ownership register. However, in 2019, Treasury said that “no commitment to implement a register has been made by government”. More recently, in October last year, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said that a project under way to modernise the company registry will “enable the development of a beneficial ownership register”.",News/Australia news,"Australia risks damage to economy without expanded money laundering laws, says Senate committee ",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/31/australia-risks-damage-to-economy-without-expanded-money-laundering-laws-says-senate-committee

3/31/2022,"Dr Moana Jackson, the pioneering Māori lawyer and a global authority on indigenous people’s rights, has died. Jackson’s scholarship and activism has been influential in shaping public debate around colonisation and Te Tiriti o Waitangi, the Treaty of Waitangi, Aotearoa New Zealand’s founding document. He died in New Zealand’s Bay of Plenty, following a lengthy illness with cancer. Māori development minister Willie Jackson – a nephew of Jackson – has paid tribute, telling the New Zealand Herald that he was “proud to have an uncle held in such high esteem and had such a brilliant mind.” “Uncle Moana was a man who always waited to be called on and was never one to jump in front of the limelight,” Jackson said. Born in 1948, Jackson (Ngāti Kahungunu, Rongomaiwahine, Ngāti Porou) was the son of an All Black, Everard Jackson, and brother of prominent Māori activist and trade unionist Syd Jackson. “When I was growing up I didn’t hear the word ‘colonisation’ very much but I was always aware, I think, of its cold and unrelenting hurt,” Jackson said in an interview with the Counterfutures journal in 2017. “So I guess colonisation politicised me, and with it a sense of the need to settle all that it has done and continues to do”. Those experiences shaped Jackson’s work championing indigenous rights in law and working in academia over the last five decades. After training as a lawyer and working as a Māori language teacher, Jackson studied in the US, where he also worked for the Navaho Legal Service. After returning to New Zealand in the 1980s he co-founded Ngā Kaiwhakamarama i Ngā Ture – the Māori Legal Service – and later the Te Hau Tikanga, the Māori law commission. In 1988, Jackson authored a groundbreaking report into Māori experiences of New Zealand’s criminal justice system, which highlighted widespread institutional racism and called for greater recognition of the impacts of colonialism on Māori. Among other things, that report recommended the establishment of a parallel Māori justice system, a recommendation which was not implemented. Speaking to the Guardian in 2015, Jackson said that “not a great deal has changed in 25 years”, and that it was impossible to separate the place of Māori in the prison system from the impact of colonisation, and the disputes around the meaning of the Treaty of Waitangi. In 2007, he resigned as a patron for the police after raids targeting Māori activists using contentious anti-terrorism powers. “Every act of resistance by Māori since 1840 has been met with opposition … Those who take power unjustly defend it with injustice,” he said at the time. In recent years, Jackson led work around constitutional transformation, helping to produce a report calling for an overhaul of New Zealand’s constitutional arrangements to better address Māori interests.

3/31/2022,"Formula One will stage a grand prix in Las Vegas next year which will be run on a Saturday night. The addition to the calendar of the November race reflects the growing popularity of F1 in the US with two races already set to be hosted this year in Miami and Austin, Texas. It will be the first time the city in Nevada has held a race since hosting two in 1981 and 1982, known as the Caesars Palace Grands Prix. Held in a car park adjacent to the casino, they did not prove popular. The date has yet to be confirmed but a new 3.8-mile, 14-corner circuit will run past some of Las Vegas’s most famous landmarks including Caesars, the Las Vegas Strip, the Bellagio fountains and the Eiffel tower of the Paris Casino. F1 has been enjoying a resurgence in the US, assisted by the huge interest in the Netflix documentary series Drive To Survive. The race in Las Vegas will be organised by F1 itself in partnership with the city and its businesses rather than by a race promoter. F1’s owners, Liberty Media, have made no secret of their ambition to grow the sport in America and this is a bold move in that direction. The 2023 season is now set to include three races in the US, only the third time in F1’s history the same country has had so many. In 1982 Long Beach hosted the United States Grand Prix West and was joined by the Caesars Palace GP in Las Vegas and the Detroit GP. Only Italy in 2020 has also hosted three: Monza, Imola and Mugello, and that was due to the pandemic and the need to fill the calendar. This time the US is being actively pursued as a market in which to expand. “This is an incredible moment for Formula One that demonstrates the huge appeal and growth of our sport with a third race in the US,” said F1’s CEO Stefano Domenicali. The race will, however, add further pressure to an already demanding calendar. This year 23 races are scheduled to be held while the commercial agreement between F1 and the teams allows for a maximum of 24 in a year. Domenicali has said the demand to host races was high enough to support as many as 30 in a season. A race in South Africa is also expected to be added to the calendar and with the finite 24 slots available F1 has already floated the idea of rotating races – selected meetings being held one year and others the next. Given the huge financial return from state-sponsored meetings such as those in the Middle East, the races likely to face rotation are those in Europe. The all-female W Series has confirmed its calendar of 10 races for 2023, all at F1 grands prix. It will open with a double-header in Miami, and race at Silverstone in July as well as at Suzuka in Japan for the first time.",Sport/Sport,Las Vegas to become third American F1 grand prix venue in 2023,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/31/las-vegas-to-become-third-american-f1-grand-prix-venue-in-2023
