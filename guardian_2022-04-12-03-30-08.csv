4/12/2022,"A metro mayor has threatened to halt a popular e-scooter scheme if the Swedish company behind it does not do more to sever links with Russia. The west of England mayor, Dan Norris, said he is deeply concerned that Stockholm-based Voi still has two major Russian shareholders who own millions of pounds of stock in the company. Norris met with the CEO of Voi Technology, Fredrik Hjelm, in Bristol, where the scheme operates, to “grill” him about the shareholders. He warned he would look elsewhere for e-scooter providers if he was not satisfied the company was doing everything in its power to distance itself from the investors. Speaking after the meeting, Norris said: “The people of western England want to know that Voi is not linked with the bad things we are hearing about in Ukraine. “Voi has got a difficult call to make. For me it’s very clear – I want the west of England to have minimum links with the Russian regime. I accept in this joined-up world it is difficult to have zero involvement with Russia but it’s my job, knowing the strength of feeling, that we minimise those dubious links wherever they are.” Since the invasion of Ukraine, the investments in Voi of the Russian businessmen Alexander Eliseev and Ilya Yushaev have come under the spotlight. Norris said: “I’m not happy with these people being shareholders in Voi. I’m not happy there is that connection and I want it severed.” The men have not been placed under sanctions, but Norris said: “I believe that if you become fabulously wealthy as these people are, that is because the [Russian] state allows it and presumably Mr Putin allows it and that makes me concerned. “I hope they sell [their shares] quickly. But they probably want to hold out for as much money as they can get. That’s how capitalism works. But my view is, the sooner they leave the better. Ultimately other e-scooters are available.” Voi e-scooters can be found British cities including Birmingham, Cambridge, Oxford and Liverpool and across Europe. Speaking at the same press conference, Hjelm said the Bristol scheme was by far the biggest in the UK. There have already been 4m trips on the scooters and 250,000 unique users. He said the two Russians, who together owned just under 4% of the company, had transferred their voting rights to him, adding: “We are exploring what we can do while respecting Swedish law and shareholder right. You can’t just take shares from an investor, they own the shares.” Hjelm, who learned Russian in the Swedish armed forces and has lived and worked in Russia, characterised the regime as “Putin and his bandits” and said the day after Moscow invaded Voi had cut its ties and would not take any future investments from Russians. But he added: “We cannot re-write history.” He said he was continually talking to the two investors and privately they had made their opposition to Putin and the invasion clear. Hjelm also warned Norris that he might find that other e-scooter companies had links to Russia or other regimes that the mayor might not like. The e-scooter trial in Bristol is due to run until November at which point it is to be evaluated to see if it should continue. Norris said that if he was not satisfied with Voi’s actions he would look for other providers.",News/UK news,E-scooter scheme could close over ‘dubious’ Russia links,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/e-scooter-scheme-could-close-over-dubious-russia-links
4/12/2022,"One of Brazil’s leading newspapers has been forced into a mortifying retraction after inadvertently announcing the death of Queen Elizabeth “at the age of XX”. The Folha de São Paulo incorrectly reported the British monarch’s demise on its website at about noon on Monday, telling millions of South American readers she had died “as a result of XXXXXXXX”. “Elizabeth will go down in history as the longest-reigning British sovereign,” the newspaper said in its 1,300-word tribute to a woman who remained very much alive. Realising its royal mistake, the Folha deleted its premature obituary and blamed the bloomer on “technical error”. “It is normal practice in journalism to prepare stories about possible and/or probable situations, such as the death of world leaders, celebrities and public figures. Folha regrets the error,” the newspaper said. That, though, was not enough to prevent a deluge of online ridicule over the premature eulogy to the sovereign, whose last official visit to Brazil came in 1968. “God save the Folha,” tweeted one reader. Referring to the assertion the monarch had passed away “age XX”, the comedian and actor Gregorio Duvivier sniggered: “How cute the Folha doesn’t want to reveal how old the Queen was when she died.” Others questioned the decision to illustrate the article with a photograph in which the Queen seemed to be laughing at her own death. Much of the jeering came from supporters of Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro, a media-bashing rightwing populist who often attacks the Folha, just as his political icon, Donald Trump, attacks CNN. Bolsonaristas seized on the slip-up as further proof that the newspaper – a frequent critic of Brazil’s radical leader – was a wellspring of leftist disinformation. “Folha, you are a veritable factory of fake news, claiming Little Lizzy has died,” one tweeted alongside a gif of Trump declaring: “Fake News!” Oduwaldo Calixto, a conservative activist from Bolsonaro’s Liberal party, joked: “The Folha de São Paulo tried to kill the Queen of England to see if people would buy it. If they had, they’d surely have tried to kill president Bolsonaro too.” “Will Brazil one day have real journalists again?” wondered Calixto, whose president’s followers deride the supposedly communist Folha as the “Foice de São Paulo” (The Sickle of São Paulo). Journalists themselves were far more forgiving, understanding that the Folha’s blunder could easily have befallen them too. “Newspaper’s nightmare: accidentally publishing someone’s obit. In this case, Queen Elizabeth. Eek …” tweeted David Biller, the Brazil news director for the Associated Press.",News/World news,Dead wrong: Brazilian newspaper ridiculed after saying Queen has died,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/dead-wrong-brazilian-newspaper-ridiculed-after-saying-queen-has-died

4/12/2022,"BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, has come under pressure to delay demands for debt interest payments from Zambia to prevent the crisis-hit African country’s finances from spiralling out of control. Anti-poverty campaigners said BlackRock, which manages $10tn (£7.68tn) of assets, was among the private sector lenders that had refused to reduced the interest rate or delay payments on Zambian bonds, unlike governments and international agencies that hold the country’s debts. The charity Jubilee Debt Campaign said it estimated the asset manager, which holds $220m of Zambian sovereign bonds, mostly on behalf of clients in its index-linked exchange-traded funds, could generate a $180m profit if the debts were paid in full. “This would represent a 110% profit on what we estimate BlackRock paid for the debt,” the charity said. Zambia, which has cut health and social care spending by a fifth in the last two years to balance its budget, has seen its debts soar in recent years to fund infrastructure projects, many to help the country supplement drought-affected hydro power plants. Solar energy projects have made the country almost self-sufficient in electricity, but the high cost of borrowing and the Covid crisis has crippled the country’s finances. Further loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have been tied to commitments to end fuel subsidies to households and businesses, pushing the inflation rate above 20% last year. Of Zambia’s external debt, 46% is owed to private lenders, 22% to China, 8% to other governments and 18% to multilateral institutions. China is among the government lenders to agree a longer debt repayment schedule that private lenders, including banks, have so far resisted, the Jubilee Debt campaign said. The Zambian government has already defaulted on loans from commercial lenders and could default on further loans, risking it becoming a pariah on international debt markets. Since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, the charity estimates Zambia’s bonds have had an average face value of 59 cents on the dollar, and the average interest rate on its bonds is 8.1%. The southern African country applied for a new G20 debt relief scheme at the start of 2021 but has not yet had any debt cancelled. Tim Jones, the Jubilee Debt Campaign’s head of policy, said BlackRock had bought Zambian bonds at rock bottom prices when it was clear the country was already in trouble. He said: “It is unfair for BlackRock and other lenders to make massive profits out of Zambia’s debt crisis. If BlackRock refuses to cancel Zambia’s debt, then the UK and other G20 countries should support Zambia to stay in default on BlackRock.” Isaac Mwaipopo, a member of the Zambia Civil Society Debt Alliance, said: “Zambia’s debt crisis is preventing people getting access to healthcare, education and other social services. “We urgently need all of Zambia’s lenders, including BlackRock, to agree to cancel debt so we can recover from the Covid pandemic and the economic crisis we face. Loans were given at high interest rates, and have been trading at low prices, so it is only fair lenders agree significant debt cancellation, rather than making mass profit out of the Zambian people.” Negotiations on the debt restructuring are due to take place later this month. G20 finance ministers are scheduled to meet on 20 April, during the IMF spring meetings, to discuss the progress of the debt relief scheme, known as the common framework. Zambia, Chad and Ethiopia applied last year for debt relief under the common framework, which the IMF said has yet to be agreed, partly because it requires private creditors to participate “on comparable terms to overcome collective action challenges and ensure fair burden sharing”.

4/12/2022,"The Parole Board has recommended that the ringleader of a murder that shocked Britain in 2007 be moved to an open prison. Garry Newlove, a father of three, was “kicked like a football” in front of his family by drunken youths he had challenged after they vandalised vehicles outside his Cheshire home. Adam Swellings was one of three teenagers found guilty of the murder, committed after a seven-hour drinking binge. Then 19, Swellings was jailed for life with a minimum sentence of 17 years. Stephen Sorton, 17, was handed a 15-year minimum sentence, and Jordan Cunliffe, 16, was ordered to serve a minimum of 12 years. Now the decision whether to support the board’s decision to move 33-year-old Swellings to a lower-security jail rests with the justice secretary, Dominic Raab. Newlove, a 47-year-old sales manager, confronted the teenagers barefoot before he was knocked to the ground outside his house in Warrington. The group walked off, leaving Newlove’s wife and three daughters to help him. Two days later, he died in hospital from a head injury. In its recommendation, the board said there have been “no concerns” about Swellings’ behaviour during his time in custody, and his conduct has been “regarded as exemplary”. Swellings’ probation officer noted his maintained “positive outlook” and a psychologist said open conditions were “more realistic” to test his progress. A move to an open prison is often the precursor to a full release. The board reviews about 26,000 cases annually, and fewer than 1% of prisoners it releases go on to commit a serious further offence. During the 2008 trial, the jury heard Swellings had smoked five cannabis joints and drunk four litres of cider. He punched Newlove to the ground as other gang members shouted “Get him” and “Do him, Swellhead”. Cunliffe bragged afterwards that they had “just banged a man and he’s not moving”. Calling the incident a “gang attack” when jailing the teenagers more than two decades ago, Judge Andrew Smith said: “They were the actions of a courageous and devoted family man, who paid with his life. You three were only so brave because you outnumbered him many times over.” In 2008, Newlove’s wife, Helen, told reporters that the UK should have the death penalty and she believed the convicted trio should never be released from prison. In the document detailing the decision, Swellings was described as having “difficulties dealing with extremes of emotion” at the time of the murder and covered his “low self-esteem” with “arrogance in order to maintain status with antisocial friends”. Following the case, Helen, now Baroness Newlove, campaigned for action on youth crime and created a charity, Newlove Warrington, aimed at improving facilities for children in the Cheshire town. From 2012 to 2019 she served as victims’ commissioner for England and Wales.",News/UK news,Garry Newlove killer recommended for move to open prison,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/garry-newlove-killer-recommended-for-move-to-open-prison
4/12/2022,"As the smoke cleared following the first round of France’s presidential election on Sunday, the most significant political speech of the night was arguably delivered by one of the losers. After coming unexpectedly close to beating Marine Le Pen to second place in the race, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the hard-left leader of France Unbowed, urged his supporters not to vote for her in the runoff between Emmanuel Macron on 24 April. “There must not be one single vote for Le Pen in the second round,” said Mr Mélenchon. The bluntness of the message indicates the gravity of a political moment that feels alarmingly unpredictable and unreadable. Mr Macron secured 28% of the first-round vote. His four-point lead over Ms Le Pen was actually slightly bigger than five years ago, when he went on to win their head-to-head confrontation by a landslide. But the context of 2017 – when Mr Macron was seen as a fresh-faced liberal insurgent promising democratic renewal, and Ms Le Pen was struggling and failing to detoxify her brand – no longer applies. This time round, polls suggest a far tighter contest in two weeks, with some suggesting that the gap between the two candidates is within the margin of error; for the first time in the 64-year history of the Fifth Republic, the French far right has a genuine – if outside – chance of winning the presidency. How did France get here? Clever PR has enabled Ms Le Pen to successfully soften her public image, while the ongoing collapse of the centre-left and centre-right has normalised her presence in the spotlight. The emergence of a far-right rival in the form of the xenophobic television pundit Éric Zemmour has also helped, allowing the National Rally leader to present herself as a relative moderate while preparing to inherit his support. In the runoff, she will be able to consolidate a far-right bloc of more than 30% of voters. But as Mr Mélenchon’s Sunday night injunction suggested, Ms Le Pen’s chances of actually entering the Élysée depend on her ability to mobilise a section of the left – one which is just as hostile to the mainstream consensus that Mr Macron embodies. To that end, Ms Le Pen will continue to channel anxiety over the cost-of-living crisis, while downplaying the more extreme aspects of her programme relating to immigration, Islam and Europe. As the first-round results emerged, she in effect made a direct pitch to the anti-establishment left, promising a presidency devoted to offering “social justice and protection” and “solidarity towards the most vulnerable”. Polls suggest that 30% of mainly working-class Mélenchon supporters may vote for her and an equal number abstain. Mr Macron cannot afford those numbers to go much higher, but unpopular policies such as raising the retirement age risk becoming a liability. A president sometimes perceived as aloof, high-handed and on the side of the wealthy – and whose relations with much of the left have ranged from tricky to toxic – thus faces the biggest test of his political career. The stakes could scarcely be higher: a Le Pen presidency would unleash xenophobic and nationalist demons in France, have dramatic repercussions for the future of the EU and disrupt western unity at a critical moment. Perhaps understandably, given his focus on events in Ukraine, Mr Macron has fought a lacklustre and lethargic campaign so far. His visit on Monday to a depressed post-industrial region in northern France signalled a change of gear. Between now and 24 April, Mr Macron must find a way to shore up a “republican front” of anti-far-right voters that appears dangerously fragile. The reckoning as to how it was ever allowed to get this close can come later.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Macron v Le Pen: not a case of deja vu | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/11/the-guardian-view-on-macron-v-le-pen-not-a-case-of-deja-vu
4/12/2022,"Teachers said they no longer want police to be stationed in schools after outrage over the treatment of Child Q, as National Education Union members voted for the removal of the senior Met police officers involved in the case. Delegates to the NEU’s annual conference backed a motion that said calling the police to deal with pupils “must be a last resort” for schools and teachers. A succession of speakers told the conference that Child Q’s experience – where she was strip-searched by police at her school – was not an isolated case for black pupils, who were more likely to be affected by police stationed under the safer schools officer (SSO) policy. A national outcry followed last month when it emerged that the 15-year-old girl had been strip-searched by Met officers at her school after a false accusation that she possessed cannabis. No cannabis was found. “What happened to Child Q cannot be allowed to ever happen again,” said Carly Slingsby, a teacher from Hackney, the local authority that includes Child Q’s school. “We need to close the doors and school gates to the police so that our children will know they won’t be the next Child Q.” Slingsby said schools were selected to have an SSO based on the proportion of pupils on free school meals, absentee rates and the number of children with social workers: “These officers have made up their mind about our children before they even set foot in the school.” Louise Lewis, an NEU executive member and teacher from Kirklees, said her heart broke when she read about Child Q’s experiences. “For staff in schools, the policies and systems in place for schools to protect this child failed in the worst way possible, as did the police. Unfortunately this was not an isolated incident by the police, and that’s why we need change now,” Lewis said. “These figures and incidents are alarming and therefore, as the largest education union in the UK, it’s important we stand with Child Q and support her drive for change.” Neil Dhanda, a teacher from Redbridge, told delegates at the conference in Bournemouth that the Child Q case “should raise questions about whether police should be in schools at all”. “As shocking as it is, this is not the only example of harm caused by police presence. There are similarly affected families who are concerned that police in schools have a disproportionate impact on black children. “Schools should not be policed and children should not be criminalised. This only serves to limit their educational and life opportunities, feeding a school-to-prison pipeline that unfairly impacts working-class and black students.” Kevin Courtney, the union’s joint general secretary, said: “This has to stop, and the NEU is calling on the police to stop searching children and on the government to consult widely about revised behaviour guidance, which has child safeguarding front and centre. In his opening speech to the conference, the NEU president, Daniel Kebede, said the Child Q case highlighted “a growing trend in which police are ever-present in schools”, leading to the increased criminalisation of children. “Some say I’m wrong and police can provide a pastoral role, but I don’t think that’s right. They degraded, abused and humiliated Child Q,” Kebede said. Noting that Child Q had not been in possession of drugs, Kebede said: “I know a place where 11 in 12 toilets tested positive for cocaine. It’s a place where there is a 24-hour police presence. It’s called the Houses of Parliament. Why are [the Met] strip-searching children and not strip-searching MPs?”",News/Education,Teachers say they no longer want police based in schools after Child Q outrage,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/11/teachers-say-they-no-longer-want-police-based-in-schools-after-child-q-outrage
4/12/2022,"The year 1922 represented a turning point for culture. It marked the publication of James Joyce’s Ulysses, the creation of the BBC and the founding of a small production company by a young animator called Walt Disney. It was also when TS Eliot published his great, knotty poem The Waste Land, pushing modernism to the high ground of English language poetry. And the music hall artiste Marie Lloyd was laid to rest in a funeral that is said to have attracted a bigger crowd than any since the Duke of Wellington’s 70 years earlier. These last two events have more in common than mere chronology. Lloyd was a woman of the people, a singer of popular ballads, some wistful, some nudge and wink, whose death plunged Eliot into a state of histrionic mourning. She began her career as a teenager singing temperance songs in church and suffered the cruel irony that the last song she performed was about a woman – like her – who had ignored such warnings. Her death, wrote Eliot, was a significant moment in English history, due to her appeal to working-class audiences and “the extent to which she represented and expressed that part of the English nation which has perhaps the greatest vitality and interest”. A century on, Eliot can seem an effete, politically unattractive character, who has held the academy in thrall with his wilful obscurity. But even The Waste Land breaches the boundaries between high and low culture. He was also the author of Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats, whose posthumous alliance with Andrew Lloyd Webber, through the musical Cats, has seen the publisher Faber through many a lean year. His lighter side has emerged as the vaults are cranked open on his often riotously vulgar private poetry, and the thousand love letters he penned over decades to his American college girlfriend, Emily Hale. The Hale letters will be made public this autumn. The Waste Land celebrations, however, are being held not in the centenary month of October, but in April, which he famously declared “the cruellest month”. His connection with Lloyd will rightly be honoured. “No other comedian succeeded so well in giving expression to the life of [her] audience, in raising it to a kind of art,” he wrote. The same could be said of Eliot himself. He lived through two world wars and has left monuments to both. But it’s often his less grandiose interventions that resonate. What better shorthand for today’s political slipperiness than Macavity: the Mystery Cat, with its repeated refrain that, when you reach the scene of crime, “Macavity’s not there!” What more resonant comment on the defiance of ageing baby boomers than “I grow old … I grow old … / I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled”, from The Lovesong of J Alfred Prufrock? “Of all the years in this dramatic decade, 1922 was the most turbulent,” says the author Nick Rennison in his recent book on these 12 months. “It was a year which altered the map of the world.” How little things change a century later, as the old world strains against the new and society is being shaped by the trauma of war and pandemic.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on TS Eliot’s modernism: between high and low culture | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/11/the-guardian-view-on-ts-eliots-modernism-between-high-and-low-culture
4/12/2022,"Compared to most other countries, Australia was relatively unscathed by the pandemic, although its health results were achieved by severe measures, including lockdowns and border closures. Scott Morrison has a figure to convey just how well we’ve done: 40,000 lives saved. But how is this calculated, is it the whole story and who gets the credit for this boast? Morrison has been using the figure since about mid-December, when he explained it was “based on the average [number of deaths] in the OECD”. Associate Professor, James Wood, a mathematician in the University of New South Wales’ school of public health, told Guardian Australia the claim is “accurate”. In 2020 and 2021, 0.15% of the population in OECD countries died of Covid which, if applied to the Australian population is about 40,000, he said. The first thing to note is that the OECD may not be the best guide to measure Australia’s Covid response. Wood noted the OECD’s death rate is dragged up by the US, and by “middle income countries” like Mexico and Poland, which have “had a pretty bad experience”. The latter are not the sorts of countries we usually compare ourselves to on health outcomes. “Even Sweden, with its much maligned Covid response, is significantly below the OECD average of deaths,” he said. Dr Michael Lydeamore, an infectious disease modeller from Monash University, said it is a “reasonably valid claim” given Australia’s “very good pandemic response”. He noted Australia was helped by its geography. “To have a period where there is no Covid in the country at all, you can only do that if people are either not coming in or subject to very strict quarantine, which was only possible because we’re an island nation,” he said, unlike Europe and the US. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The second thing to note is: the 40,000 figure only compares 2020 and 2021, not 2022, a year in which hospitalisations and deaths increased significantly due to eased restrictions despite very high rates of vaccination. Wood said the results will be “very different” in 2022, and Australia will be “much closer to the OECD average” because Covid has had a “fairly similar impact” once restrictions were eased. About two-thirds (4,309) of Australia’s total deaths from Covid (6,562) have occurred in 2022. Prof Nancy Baxter, the head of the University of Melbourne’s school of population health and clinical epidemiologist, said use of the figure “makes it seem like past success is a predictor of future success”. “What we’ve seen with Omicron and the loosening of restrictions is a lot of unnecessary deaths and hospitalisations,” she said. Baxter cited mask mandates, working from home and better ventilation as policy settings that could have saved lives. Baxter argued the figure also “fails to acknowledge any potential to do better: a faster vaccine rollout could’ve saved a lot of grief”. Baxter noted the commonwealth “set priorities for vaccination that were entirely sensible – it just didn’t enact anything that would make that happen”, leaving Indigenous Australians, aged care residents and people with disabilities behind. Indigenous Australians contracted the Delta strain at double the rates of non-Indigenous Australians. Indigenous vaccination rates (82% of those aged 12 and over) still lag the rest of the population, and 105 Indigenous people have died since the start of the pandemic. Lydeamore said it’s “difficult to attribute blame or credit” for Covid policies, as some were federal (the national border), some state (lockdowns and state borders) and some shared responsibilities (like aged care). “The whole system has to work together.” Baxter said it was “questionable” for the commonwealth to be taking credit, because many of the policy levers were activated by states, such as lockdowns, to make up for federal “deficiencies”. “Because our vaccine rollout was so slow that necessitated long lockdowns in Victoria and NSW that could have been avoided.” Morrison’s figure is accurate but it obscures Australia’s more recent Covid deaths. Australia’s health outcomes during Covid were excellent, but it’s not a commonwealth success story, it’s a federal one.",News/Australia news,"Fact check: did Scott Morrison really save 40,000 lives from Covid?",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/fact-check-did-scott-morrison-really-save-40000-lives-from-covid
4/12/2022,"In 2015, between dusty rows of shelves in a small op-shop somewhere in suburban Sydney, I made a vow to myself: whenever I spotted a copy of Dude, Where’s My Car? on DVD, I would have to buy it. There was no deeper thought behind the mission. To this day I have not even watched the movie. But something about its cover – Ashton Kutcher, wide-eyed, hamming into the camera; the extremely Y2K gradient; the charmingly chunky letters spelling out its title – felt right. It felt soothing. So clutching a very faded DVD – which had probably been there since its 2001 release – I made my way to the counter and sheepishly handed over a $5 note. Since then, I have not amassed a particularly impressive collection of Dude, Where’s My Car? DVDs (unless you count 15 as impressive, in which case you would be very generous). But still, there is something sentimental about each copy – the one I got from a flea market on holidays, or the time I was fleeced out of $20 by an expedient vendor. I believe I was brainwashed by Ashton’s thousand-yard stare. My quest may be singular and foolhardy, but I am not alone in the sentimentality – at least if the outpouring of tributes last month for Sydney’s Film Club is anything to go by. Based in Darlinghurst, the “last, best” video store in the city – as it described itself – had survived the mass extinction of its bigger peers for a decade, only to be scuppered by … well, the last two years. Over the course of a month, Film Club slowly cleared out, selling – then giving away – its 25,000-strong disk collection. This article includes content provided by Instagram.

Heartbreak was the word. “It was such a great pleasure engaging with physical film again,” wrote one user. “While Film Club may be gone … a small piece of it will reside on the shelves of collectors,” went another ode in the University of Sydney’s student newspaper Honi Soit. DVD shops are few and far between, but the ones remaining have become glimmers of hope for their community, providing copies of films otherwise lost to changing times and tastes. Lost with them are the rare titbits of director’s commentary, behind-the-scenes footage, and – fine – blooper reels, not to mention the more niche films which never made it on to streaming in the first place. “If you close, there are things we won’t have access to,” said one regular to Picture Search, Melbourne’s last video shop.

4/12/2022,"Peak legal organisations and trade unions have joined calls to reform aspects of Queensland’s anti-discrimination laws, including scrapping a clause used by some religious groups to justify contracts that suggest they could sack openly gay, transgender or unmarried people. The controversial “genuine occupational requirement” clause in the Queensland Anti-Discrimination act allows religious bodies to discriminate in circumstances where a person “openly acts in a way that the person knows or ought reasonably to know is contrary to the employer’s religious beliefs”. Some school and church employment contracts have used wording which reflects the clause, such as at Citipointe Christian College, which warned explicitly that teachers could be sacked for behaving in a way incompatible with the religious beliefs of the college, including “in relation to the expression of human sexuality through heterosexual, monogamous relationships, expressed intimately through marriage.” The school said last month that the contract was “under review” and that “new wording is awaiting approval”. Guardian Australia has seen similar contracts for teachers at other Queensland schools. The Human Rights Commission Queensland is undertaking a review of state anti-discrimination laws, and submissions include discussion about the “genuine occupational requirement” clause. In a submission to the review, the Australian Christian Lobby and several Christian schools organisations argued religious freedom measures should be strengthened. “Religious organisations should be able to ensure that any employment decision they make is in accordance with the doctrines, tenets and beliefs of the organisation,” the ACL’s national director, Wendy Francis, wrote. Legal groups, including the Queensland Law Society and the Australian Lawyers’ Alliance, argued the “genuine occupational requirement” clause should be reformed, in line with the Tasmanian model which allows religious schools to hire and retain staff of their same faith, but not discriminate against them on other grounds, such as relationship status, gender identity or sexuality. The Queensland Council of Unions said it backed the repeal of the exemption “in a contemporary society” in line with a submission from the union representing non-government school teachers. The Independent Education Union, in its submission, said the entire section of the legislation should be deleted, describing the exemptions as “inherently unfair” and out of step with modern community expectations. “A permanent and relatively unfettered legislative exemption to allow faith-based educational institutions to discriminate in employment overrides the rights of many, without proper justification,” the union’s submission says. “The provision is generally thought to have a disproportionate impact on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) workers, but the effect of the exemption is much more broad reaching. “An unmarried pregnant woman, or a divorced person, or a person with a child to someone they are not married to, is a lawful participant of society and is widely accepted as not infringing on community standards. However, the … exemption may be used to justify a decision to terminate that person’s employment.” Many of the submissions to the review detailed examples of the harmful effects of discrimination at different schools across the state. The Sikh Nishkam Society of Australia said Sikh students were “bullied” and called names in school playgrounds, and asked to cut their hair to comply with school uniform policies. “If they don’t cut their hair, their enrolments are not accepted,” the submission says. The Queensland Council for LGBTI Health detailed dozens of examples from people who spoke about shared anonymous stories of abuse, discrimination and other forms of prejudice. “My child who identifies as gender fluid was not able to express their gender fluidity at their school,” one person said. “It was made clear that no concessions would be made to accept my child’s preferred name, pronouns or amenities needs.” The Human Rights Commission’s discussion paper asked for feedback on the idea of “positive duties” – which are effectively responsibilities on employers and organisations to prevent discrimination and harassment. The Queensland rugby league submission details stakeholder feedback, including a survey of officials, local clubs and volunteers that found 82% supported the idea that the law should impose a positive duty on organisations, and that their compliance should be monitored. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The ACL opposed the notion of a positive duty. “Positive duties to eradicate discrimination will unfairly prejudice religious organisations and schools,” the Christian lobby’s submission said. “Not-for-profit religious organisations will be taken away from their core mission, have their resources unduly stretched, and in some cases may be forced to compromise on their deeply held conviction.” The ACL opposed expanded regulatory powers for the Human Rights Commission and complained that the anti-discrimination act should not be used as a “vehicle for progressive ideology”. It said the discussion paper focused on “contestable and ideological concepts”, such as the concept of equality as a right, and the idea that discrimination is systemic. “Discrimination law is no place for such ideology”.",News/Australia news,Unions and law groups push to scrap Queensland clause allowing religious bodies to sack openly LGBTQ+ people,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/unions-and-law-groups-push-to-scrap-queensland-clause-allowing-religious-bodies-to-sack-openly-lgbtq-people
4/12/2022,"On the first official day of the 2022 election campaign, Labor leader Anthony Albanese notably stumbled over Australia’s jobless rate and the cash rate. What numbers should politicians – and voters – know and care about besides the price of a litre of milk or petrol, or a loaf of bread? Here are eight of the most important. According to leading marine scientists such as Terry Hughes, the Great Barrier Reef is enduring its sixth mass coral bleaching event on record. Authorities say they are still assessing its severity and extent. All six have occurred since 1998; four since the 2015-16 summer. Significantly, the most recent has unfolded for the first time during a typically cooler La Niña year. March’s record marine temperatures pushed corals beyond their heat tolerance, and it remains unclear how many will recover. Quite aside from its environmental value, an estimated 60,000 tourism jobs depend on the reef. Renewable energy supplied almost a third, or 32.5%, of national electricity generation in 2021, according to the Clean Energy Council’s annual report released earlier this month. That was up from 27.7% in 2020, and included Tasmania’s 99.9% share. Still, the renewable energy industry’s momentum is slowing, council head Kane Thornton says – in part because of federal policy uncertainty. That matters if Australia (or any other nation) is to wean itself off fossil fuels. The wage price index (WPI) figure may carry the most weight of any of the economic data: its next update lands 18 May, just three days before the election. Wages rose 2.3% in 2021, shy of the consumer price increase (see below), according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics’s most recent reading. That next index update will cover the March quarter. According to the federal budget, the index for the year to June is forecast to rise to 2.75%, and accelerate to 3.25% and 3.5% in the following two years. The WPI isn’t the only big number to land before 21 May. The consumer price index for the March quarter will be unpacked on 27 April by the ABS, and shoppers know it’s likely to eclipse the 3.5% recorded for 2021. Although only a proxy for the true cost of living, the CPI serves as a key inflation guide. In 2021, it outpaced wages by more than 1 percentage point – so many of us went backwards in “real” terms. By mid-year, economists are tipping the CPI to rise to 5%. Somewhat optimistically, treasury predicted in last month’s federal budget that CPI will peak at 4.25% this fiscal year and decline in each of the following three years. During the official election campaign, the Morrison government will get two releases from the Australian Bureau of Statistics of the monthly unemployment rate – arguably its more positive economic result. February’s 4% jobless rate was one of the two numbers Albanese fluffed on Monday. Already near a 48-year low, the rate may drop into the 3%-range when the bureau releases March labour force figures on Thursday. If the many “help wanted” signs in shop windows are any indicator, the tally may be lower again when the ABS posts the April figures on 19 May – two days before the election. The other number Albanese tripped over was the official cash rate set by the Reserve Bank of Australia. Actually, it’s a target rate – and it has sat at 0.1% since November 2020. The central bank board has met 15 times since, and left it undisturbed at that record low. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The next board meeting is 3 May. Investors and economists aren’t expecting the RBA to provide a pre-election shock by lifting the cash rate target, but consensus is growing that rises will begin the following month – possibly continuing each month for the following year or so. A higher cash rate will feed into higher repayment costs for mortgage holders and businesses alike, as banks pass on their own higher borrowing costs. Another good news story for the government, generally speaking. Gross domestic product expanded 4.2% in 2021, leaving it 3.4% larger than before the pandemic, the ABS says. That the economy is growing relatively rapidly should not come as a huge surprise given those record-low interest rates, some record-high commodity prices (even before Russia invaded Ukraine), and record budget deficits that peaked at 6.5% of GDP in the 2020-21 fiscal year. Treasury predicts GDP growth will peak at 4.25% this fiscal year before slowing to 3% next year, and easing back into the 2%-plus range for the following three years. However, estimates that commodity prices will sink to more normal levels may prove to be too conservative – the slowdown might not be so sharp. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noted last week in the third report of its sixth assessment, the time for serious action to reduce – if not eliminate – greenhouse case emissions is “now or never”. Every 0.1 of a degree of avoided heating matters. According to the US National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration’s four monitoring sites, the most recent global average carbon dioxide content was 417.14 parts per million, up from 340ppm in 1980 and about 280ppm before the industrial era. (CSIRO’s most recent reading from the aptly named Cape Grim: 413.1ppm.) Other greenhouse gases are also on the rise, and shouldn’t be ignored.

4/12/2022,"Councils across Sydney’s west say some parents are forced to send their children to private schools due to the New South Wales government’s failure to plan for population growth, warning that it is exacerbating educational disadvantage. In a submission to a looming inquiry into school infrastructure in NSW, the councils – including some in government-held seats – warn that a lack of long-term planning has led to overcrowded classrooms. They also say parents feel pressured to send their children to private schools or travel out of their area. The submission comes amid an ongoing debate about a divide in services between western Sydney and the rest of the city, prompted by a report from the Labor-aligned McKell institute, which found the top third of council areas with the best access to public transport were all in the city’s east or north. The joint submission to the parliamentary inquiry was prepared by eight western Sydney councils, including Penrith, Camden, Wollondilly and Hawkesbury, which are in areas held by the Coalition. They warned the government has not planned for an “anticipated shortfall of classrooms” in Sydney’s west and accused the state’s education department of “inadequate forecasting for growth”. The councils used the example of Wollondilly in Sydney’s south-west. In 2018 there were 4,269 high school students in the area, but only one public school and one private high school, with a combined capacity of 2,077 students, they said. “This means that some 2,000 students leave the shire every day, attending at least 27 different high schools,” they said in the submission. While the councils described the current situation as “far from ideal”, they warned it would continue to worsen as thousands of new homes were planned for construction. In the towns of Wilton and Appin, for example, the councils estimate 45,000 new homes could be built in the coming years, based on current re-zoning. “[T]his will see at least an additional 54,000 people in the Wollondilly area of Greater Macarthur. Schools must be planned now and sequenced according to growth so that the 2,000 [student] deficit does not continue and grow,” they said. The submission also states that “delays in planning and delivery” of government schools in new development areas is leading to private schools stepping in to “fill the gap”, which“exacerbates disparities within communities”. It lists a number of examples of recent developments that have seen private schools established well before any public alternative is built. In Oran Park, in Sydney’s south-west, a Catholic school was built eight years before the first local government school opened in 2020. In the growth area of Schofields, in the north-west, the first Catholic school was built in 1996 – almost two decades before a public school was established in 2015. “The impact includes affordability of higher cost of school education for families,” the submission states. “This tendency to rely on the non-government sector in greenfield and brownfield areas to provide education facilities for new communities, puts financial pressure on families who would otherwise send their children to government schools, if they were located nearby, and disadvantages those children who have to travel some distance to attend government schools out of their area.” Last year, the NSW auditor general found that while the government had increased spending on school infrastructure, the education department had been “focused on delivering existing projects, election commitments and other government announcements”. That focus had “diverted attention from identifying and delivering projects that would have better met present and future student and classroom needs”. “While it has developed a long-term strategic plan that advises government of ongoing funding requirements, it has not presented a list of priorities to meet these needs,” the auditor general found. In a statement, the education department said it “does not agree with aspects of Western Parkland Councils’ assessment”. “We have acknowledged the challenges of accurately predicting enrolments numbers based solely on planning data,” a spokesperson said. “This is why School Infrastructure is incorporating a greater pool of data sources for improve our understanding of population projections.” Other submissions to the inquiry also raise concerns about increased overcrowding in schools, including one case where a local parents and citizens association claimed students at one western Sydney have been forced to take classes in hallways. The Concord High School P&C Association told the inquiry that despite only having an enrolment capacity for between 800 and 900 children, it currently has about 1,300 students. According to the submission, the school has 18 demountables, including toilet blocks, which have been “thoughtlessly placed and are now taking up space on the school oval”, while some classes were “being delivered in the thoroughfares of the school”. In February, the state’s opposition revealed data showing dozens of schools were exceeding enrolment caps, including cases where schools built only a few years ago were already exceeding capacity. The data showed nine of the 10 schools most over capacity were in Sydney’s west. The department spokesperson said it was “aware of enrolment growth at schools in western Sydney and is continuing to invest in new and upgraded schools to support these communities”. “Over the next four years, $2bn is being invested in school infrastructure across western Sydney, part of the NSW government’s historic $7.9bn investment.”",News/Australia news,"NSW government failures forcing parents to seek private schooling, western Sydney councils say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/nsw-government-failures-forcing-parents-to-seek-private-schooling-western-sydney-councils-say
4/12/2022,"The Australian Medical Association has warned Victoria’s elective surgery waitlist may have increased by up to 50% over the past three months, as public hospitals brace for a surge in Covid cases in the coming weeks. Guardian Australia has revealed elective surgery procedures could be wound back in the state due to staff shortages, with modelling showing Covid cases and hospitalisations from the Omicron subvariant are set to peak this month. The Andrews government this month unveiled a $1.5bn package to help clear the backlog of deferred elective surgery procedures, but the opposition criticised it as “too little too late” for the “healthcare crisis.” The state’s elective surgery waitlist ballooned during the pandemic, with 80,000 people on the elective surgery waitlist at the end of December. But the most up-to-date figures are yet to be released. The president of the Victorian AMA, Roderick McRae, said he would not be surprised if the waitlist had risen to as high as 120,000. McRae said the state government should release the latest waitlist figures as a matter of transparency. “We’re very much in favour of transparency so the good citizens of Victoria have a comprehensive understanding of the circumstances should they require hospitalisation,” he said. The opposition’s shadow minister for health, Georgie Crozier, said the government should expedite the releasing of the figures so Victorian patients, GPs and surgeons can understand “the extent of the crisis.” “With such an enormous crisis, surely you must know the numbers. They should be made transparent so that you can plan what to do,” she said. “Are they going to instigate another code brown? There’s no transparency for what the trigger points are from the government.” The Greens’ deputy leader and emergency services spokesperson, Ellen Sandell, said pressures in the public hospital system were a result of long-term unaddressed issues by successive Coalition and Labor state governments. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We need state governments to look at longer-term solutions like investing in more home-based maternity care or smaller family birth centres, looking at how GPs can better work with our hospital system to free up emergency rooms, measures to prevent burnout in nurses and midwives and investing more in preventative health,” she said. The government has warned there will be a slow decline of Covid cases, with modelling predicting a “long tail” in May due to a range of factors, including more indoor activity as winter approaches. The health minister, Martin Foley, said the Omicron subvariant could result in “several hundred” extra hospitalisations each day. Victoria’s code brown declaration, designed to reduce pressure on hospitals, ended in February, triggering the easing of restrictions on elective surgery. But it is expected to take years to clear the backlog. McRae said the elective surgery waitlist was just one part of the picture. “Within medicine, we’ve frequently discussed a waiting list to get on the waiting list,” he said. “The patient’s name is only added on to an official waiting list once there has been the referral. As a consequence, people still have to see the primary – usually general – practitioner and then be referred and they get an appointment. And so there’s inherent delays in the system.” McRae said the delays were not just because of the pandemic but also due to a lack of “reasonable and balanced investment” in its hospital system. “Our population has doubled, but our hospital capacity has not and the reflection of that is the ambulance ramping outside the emergency department,” he said. Last month, the state’s ambulance service was forced to enact a “code red” for two hours due to high demand on emergency departments and staff furloughing at hospitals, with just 1% of its paramedics available to respond to emergencies. The Andrews government has vowed its $1.5bn injection for elective surgery will see the sector operating at 125% of normal pre-pandemic levels by next year. The centrepiece of the funding, to be spread over seven years, will turn Frankston Private hospital into a public surgery facility. The funding will also create eight rapid access hubs at metropolitan hospitals over the next year that will focus exclusively on specific elective surgeries. A spokesperson for Foley said the state government had invested in “record levels” of health funding. “A record number of Victorians will receive elective surgery as part of the Andrews Labor government’s Covid Catch-Up plan – designed to exceed pre-pandemic levels by 25% and get more Victorians the care they need, when they need it.”",News/Australia news,AMA Victoria predicts further elective surgery waitlist blow out as Covid cases set to increase,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/ama-victoria-predicts-further-elective-surgery-waitlist-blow-out-as-covid-cases-set-to-increase
4/12/2022,"Australia’s coming flu season is likely to be worse than in previous pandemic years, with experts warning against complacency around influenza vaccines. There was a historically low level of influenza transmission nationally last year, largely a result of the closure of international borders and other public health measures related to Covid-19. Data from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System showed there were 598 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza in all of 2021, according to the Doherty Institute’s Prof Ian Barr. In comparison, the same number of cases has already been recorded this year, as of April 6 data. “There is normally low-level activity through these summer and autumn months, and the real uptick doesn’t start normally until May,” Barr, who is deputy director of the World Health Organization’s collaborating centre for reference and research on influenza, said. “Covid is front and centre of people’s minds and influenza isn’t really,” he said. “The virus is going to be back this year, after a two-year layoff, and vaccination is still the best way to protect yourself.” Barr was optimistic that this year’s flu season would would not be as severe as 2019, which had 313,033 laboratory-confirmed cases and 953 deaths (in comparison, there were 21,266 cases in 2020). But Nigel Stocks, a professor of general practice at the University of Adelaide, said this year brings “unknown territory”. “We face an unusual and novel situation where a lot of the community have not been exposed to influenza for at least a couple of years,” he said. Promisingly, however, the recent northern hemisphere winter saw shorter influenza outbreaks compared to pre-pandemic years. “It’s not quite clear why, but it was welcome because obviously Covid was co-circulating at the same time,” Stocks said. Co-infection with both Covid and the flu – dubbed “flurona” – is possible but not highly common, estimated to affect less than 1% of people with Covid in the general community. One UK study of more than 212,000 people, published last month in the Lancet journal, found an influenza co-infection rate of 3% among individuals admitted to hospital with Covid. Those co-infected had four times greater odds of being put on mechanical ventilation, and twice the odds of dying in hospital. “In every other season, people have had the chance of getting two infections at once,” Stocks said. “In the past it was influenza and respiratory syncytial virus or rhinovirus.” People can be simultaneously infected with both influenza A and B strains, Stocks said, but he emphasised this was uncommon. “The only way you can protect yourself is immunisation,” he said. “Unfortunately, the immunisations aren’t perfect … but they can be quite effective, particularly in older people and younger, vulnerable groups.” Young children receiving the influenza vaccine for the first time need two jabs for adequate immunisation, rather than just the one dose necessary for all other groups, Stocks said. Free influenza vaccinations are now available for groups at highest risk, including people who are over 65, pregnant or with chronic health conditions, as well as children aged six months to five years. The drop in international movement during the pandemic significantly reduced the diversity of influenza strains circulating, according to new research co-authored by Barr. The study, published in peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications, also noted that one lineage of influenza B virus, known as B/Yamagata, still appeared to have been wiped out. It has not been conclusively detected since April 2020. Barr said that if B/Yamagata had been eliminated for good, “it should make it easier for us to make the [flu] vaccine because there’ll only be three components in the standard vaccine rather than four”. “For influenza B viruses, the big advantage is there’s no animal reservoir, so it’s unlikely that B/Yamagata viruses will be hiding out in a chicken or a pig or anything like that,” Barr said. “They just don’t replicate in anything but us to any measurable extent. “It’s taken us over 20 years to get rid of this virus, not that we really managed to do it ourselves; the pandemic seems to have done it. It would be nice if it did stay away, but we can’t be sure.”",News/Australia news,Flu predicted to roar back during Australia’s winter after two-year reprieve,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/11/flu-predicted-to-roar-back-during-australias-winter-after-two-year-reprieve
4/12/2022,"Liberal moderates have expressed concern that Scott Morrison has flagged committing during the election campaign to a ban on transgender women playing women’s sport. Campaigning in the marginal seat of Gilmore on Monday, the prime minister said he shared the views of the Tasmanian Liberal senator Claire Chandler, who has advanced private member’s legislation allowing sporting groups to exclude transgender people from single-sex sports. Morrison added he would have “more to say” on the issue. The Liberal senator Andrew Bragg later said a change wasn’t necessary because the Sex Discrimination Act already contained carve-outs for strength and stamina. “The law already addresses this issue and I’m not aware of any evidence that the law is deficient,” Bragg told Guardian Australia. “I think it is working well.” Other government moderates, who declined to be named, expressed significant concern that Morrison was elevating the controversy during the federal election period, noting that Australia’s sporting codes were managing issues of participation effectively. “I don’t know why we’d go near this stuff – we don’t need this during an election campaign,” one Liberal MP said. Another speculated that Morrison was attempting to make up ground with some religious groups after he was forced to abandon his religious discrimination package earlier this year. Morrison praised Chandler’s “bravery” on the issue while on the hustings on Monday and also endorsed the views of the Liberal candidate for Warringah, Katherine Deves, who co-founded the Save Women’s Sport organisation, which campaigns to restrict trans women playing in female sporting competitions. A number of moderate metropolitan Liberals are facing challenges from independents. On Monday, the independent incumbent in Warringah, Zali Steggall, blasted Morrison’s comments on social media. “It speaks volumes of the PM’s values & moral compass that [Morrison] supports discriminating, intimidating & excluding some of the most vulnerable in our society,” Steggall said on Twitter. “How about focusing on equal pay, superannuation equity, housing security, respect & safety for women first?” Chandler’s private member’s bill would amend the Sex Discrimination Act to “clarify” that the operation of single-sex sport on the basis of biological sex was not discriminatory. The government had an opportunity to bring that bill on for debate during budget week but did not go down that path. Chandler on Monday sent out an email to supporters asking for donations to a $45,000 “action” fund that would enable “push back” against “radical activists pushing their gender fluid ideology and silencing women”. Chandler declared in the email that Labor and the Greens were “fighting to kill this bill and the mainstream media is misrepresenting it”. By donating to the fund, Chandler said, supporters could “stand up and protect the rights of women and girls by getting the word out so more Australians demand MPs and senators back my Save Women’s Sport Bill”. “Your support today will help stop the threat of the Labor-Greens grabbing more power and dismantling women’s sex-based rights.” Chandler’s Tasmanian colleague Bridget Archer has previously characterised the private member’s proposal as “a vanity bill” and “not government policy”. Archer was one of five MPs to cross the floor during the parliamentary debate on Morrison’s religious discrimination package to ensure the protection of gender non-conforming students under the Sex Discrimination Act.

Hello You (3.35), in fifth, was three-quarters of a length behind Cachet in San Diego but that race was over a mile and she was a length and a half in front of her in the Rockfel.
