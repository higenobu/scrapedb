2/2/2022,"Tonga will go into lockdown after recording two Covid-19 cases among port workers helping distribute international aid in the wake of the volcanic eruption and tsunami that devastated the Pacific country last month. The cases seem to confirm fears among Tongan officials that the arrival of aid could bring an outbreak of the virus, which could represent a bigger danger to Tonga than the tsunami.  The prime minister, Siaosi Sovaleni, said the lockdown, which begins at 6pm on Wednesday, will be open-ended, but will last for at least 48 hours, at which point it will be reviewed. The nationwide lockdown will require people to stay at home, with only essential services allowed to operate. Since the lockdown was announced, people have been scrambling to get supplies, with photographs emerging of queues down the street outside banks and shops, as people seek to get cash and food. Tonga is still reeling from the eruption of the undersea Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano on 15 January, which sent gas 20km into the air, prompted a tsunami, with waves reaching 15 metres (49ft), and blanketed the country in ash. Three people died in Tonga as a result of the tsunami and the Tongan government estimates that 84% of people in the country have been affected by it. In some islands and villages, every single house was destroyed by the tsunami. International aid has been arriving in Tonga since the disaster, with ships and planes arriving from Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Britain and China. The delivery of humanitarian relief supplies, including bulk water, hygiene kits and shelters, had aimed to be contactless. Tonga has remained Covid-free for much of the pandemic, reporting just a single case in a returning traveller in October. Travel to Tonga usually requires incoming travellers to spend three weeks in quarantine. The case in October, which also led to a lockdown, prompted a huge jump in vaccination rates in Tonga, with the government confirming that the number of those who were fully vaccinated went from around 35% before the first case was confirmed to 62% four days later. More than 20 cases of Covid-19 were reported among sailors aboard the HMAS Adelaide, which departed Australia for Tonga with supplies in the week following the eruption. There have also been Covid infections among crew members on aid flights from Japan and Australia. Tonga turned back an aid flight from Australia due to a positive Covid case on board. Small Pacific nations, including Kiribati and Palau, were among the last places to have remained Covid-free, due to their remoteness and strict bans on international travel. However, in the last month, outbreaks of Covid-19 have swept through many Pacific nations, including Samoa, Solomon Islands, Kiribati, and Palau. Just a handful of the very smallest Pacific countries – Tuvalu, Nauru, and Cook Islands – are still Covid-free. The lockdown in Tonga comes as many homes and businesses remain without internet access after the tsunami severed the sole fiber-optic cable that connects Tonga to the rest of the world. Officials are hoping repairs will be completed within a week or two. About 61% of Tonga’s 105,000 people are fully vaccinated, according to Our World in Data.",News/World news,Tsunami-hit Tonga goes into lockdown after workers helping deliver aid catch Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/tsunami-hit-tonga-goes-into-lockdown-after-workers-helping-deliver-aid-catch-covid
2/2/2022,"Until a couple of years ago, negotiating the hill leading to one of Kyoto’s most popular temples would have tested the patience of a Buddhist saint. The arrival of yet another coachload of sightseers would send pedestrians fleeing to narrow paths already clogged with meandering visitors on their way to Kiyomizu-dera. That was before Covid-19. Today, the cacophony of English and Chinese, and a smattering of other European and Asian languages, has been replaced by the chatter of Japanese children on school excursions. Shops selling souvenirs and wagashi sweets are almost empty, their unoccupied staff perhaps reminiscing about more lucrative times.  Two years into the pandemic, some of the ancient capital’s residents admit that they have learned to embrace life without foreign visitors, who were once welcomed for the money they ploughed into the local economy and resented for their cultural faux pas and, in some cases, staggering bad manners. The global boom in Japanese pop culture and cuisine, a weaker yen and fading memories of the March 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima turned the country into a tourism success story. In 2019, a record 31 million people visited from overseas – an estimated 8 million of them including Kyoto in their itinerary. Buoyed up by its successful bid to host the 2020 summer Olympics, the government set an ambitious target – to which it continues to cling – of 60 million overseas visitors by the end of this decade. But after two years of the toughest borders restrictions in the world, Japan’s tourist boom feels as if it belongs to a different age. By last year, the gains of the previous decade had been wiped out, first by the arrival of the coronavirus, then by new waves that forced the government to abandon plans for a gradual opening up to tourists and other people from overseas. Just 245,900 foreign visitors arrived in Japan in 2021, according to the tourism agency, a drop of 99.2% from pre-pandemic levels. “It feels very different now,” said the owner of an ice-cream shop near Kiyomizu temple. “There used to be lots of foreign tourists, but now it’s almost empty.” Despite the loss of revenue, Kyoto residents are divided over the eventual return of significant numbers of overseas visitors. It wasn’t long ago that the city was at the centre of a backlash against “tourism pollution”. Signs were erected in the Gion district warning visitors against trespassing and – a common complaint – pestering passing geiko and maiko entertainers for selfies as they walked to their evening teahouse appointments. Traffic clogged popular sightseeing spots, while locals struggled to find space on buses crammed with tourists and their luggage. Restaurateurs railed against tourists who made group reservations but failed to turn up. For now, Kyoto’s tourist economy is dependent on domestic visitors, whose presence ebbs and flows in lockstep with measures to contain the latest wave of coronavirus infections. Mari Samejima is among the local businesspeople who are eager for the return of the bakugai – explosive buying – unleashed by free-spending parties of Chinese tourists who descended on Kyoto before the pandemic. “They spent a lot of money here,” said Samejima, who runs a gift shop. “I understand why some people are hesitant about a return to those days – and I have my own doubts – but I’d prefer to see foreign tourists again.” The number of customers at Yoshinobu Yoshida’s shop, which sells Kyô sensu folding fans, has slumped by as much as 60% over the past two years. “I don’t know what we’ll do if it carries on like this,” said Yoshida, whose shop has stood on the same spot near Kiyomizu for a century. “If I’m honest, I can’t see it returning to normal for another few years.” With the Omicron surge yet to reach its peak, and Japan’s government showing little enthusiasm for lifting its travel ban, few expect foreign tourists to return to Kyoto soon. And when they do, the numbers are expected to be a fraction of those before the pandemic. That may not be a bad thing, according to Tomoko Nagatsuka, who remembers hearing more Chinese than Japanese being spoken in her cafe, where weary tourists recharge with green tea and traditional sweets. “Kyoto isn’t a particularly big city, so too many foreign tourists put pressure on things like public transport,” she said. “They were great for business, but it was difficult to live a normal life with so many of them milling around. Part of me really wants them back, but another part of me loves the peace and quiet.”",News/World news,Covid robbed Kyoto of foreign tourists – now it is not sure it wants them back,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/covid-robbed-kyoto-of-foreign-tourists
2/2/2022,"The New South Wales government’s proposal to raise the wall of the Warragamba Dam could result in complete inundation of some cultural sites and is at odds with Australia’s obligations under the world heritage convention, scientific advisers have warned. In a letter to the federal government, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) – which provides advice to Unesco’s World Heritage Centre – said the project “appears to be inappropriate in relation to the requirements of the world heritage convention”.  In a scathing review of the environmental impact statement (EIS) prepared for the proposal to raise the dam wall by up to 17 metres, the scientists wrote the findings contradicted the document’s conclusion that raising the dam wall “would not result in a material loss or degradation of the outstanding universal value” of the world heritage area. They noted the project was expected to result in complete inundation of some cultural sites and this loss was “clearly at odds” with the suggestion there would be no material loss or degradation of world heritage values. Bob Debus, the chair of the Colong Foundation for Wilderness and a former NSW environment minister, said the NSW government was “putting Australia on a collision course with the world heritage committee” that created the risk of an in-danger listing for the Blue Mountains. “The Unesco advice is saying quite clearly that raising of the Warragamba Dam wall is totally inconsistent with Australia’s obligations under the world heritage convention,” he said. Stuart Ayres, the minister for western Sydney, said “we don’t support the view presented by the international union”. The IUCN assessment raises several concerns with the project, including that the government had insufficiently assessed the effects on threatened plants and animals, cultural values, and the recovery of species after the 2019-20 bushfire disaster. The IUCN said it was unacceptable the government had proposed compensating for damage to world heritage values by providing offsets in other areas. The scientists further wrote that local communities and traditional owners had not been properly consulted in the development of the EIS “and it also is apparent they have not provided their free, prior and informed consent”. Ayres said the proposal to raise the wall was to mitigate downstream floods while minimising environmental impacts behind the wall. “It’s important to recognise that unlike a water storage dam that holds water permanently, the higher wall at Warragamba will only hold water above the current storage level on a temporary basis, a few hours up to 14 days,” he said. “We are confident that given the temporary and limited areas covered by inundation that environmental impacts can be managed.” A spokesperson for the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the NSW government was assessing the project on the government’s behalf, under bilateral assessment arrangements. “The bilateral agreement provides for a robust assessment of matters of national environmental significance including world heritage values,” he said. “Before making any decision on the proposal, the minister will consider the NSW government’s environmental assessment and all other matters required under national environmental law.”",News/Australia news,"Raising Warragamba Dam wall flouts Australia’s world heritage obligations, scientists warn",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/02/raising-warragamba-dam-wall-flouts-australias-world-heritage-obligations-scientists-warn
