3/25/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- China has seen investors pull money out of the country on an “unprecedented” scale since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, marking a “very unusual” shift in global capital flows in emerging markets, according to the Institute of International Finance.

Sanctions have frozen the Russian central bank’s foreign reserves held in euros and dollars, leading to speculation that Moscow may sell its holding of Chinese assets to raise funds. The Chinese stock market also tumbled earlier this month, as overseas investors retreated, partly on concern that the U.S. and European Union sanctions on Russia may somehow spill over to China. The stock market has recovered since last week as policy makers pledged to support capital markets. Padhraic Garvey, head of global debt and rate strategy at ING Financial Markets, said it’s too early to say if it’s a trend. He said the outflows may indicate that some investors decided not to reinvest bond proceeds until “greater clarity emerged on the Russia crisis.” “Often such flows can be driven by redemptions not being matched by new money, as a constant flows of new money is required just to stay invested, in particular in bonds,” he said. “It could well be that net inflows resume in the weeks and months ahead.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Hong Kong’s Completely Avoidable Covid Catastrophe Silicon Valley’s Wealthiest Russian Is Carefully—Very Carefully—Distancing Himself From Putin China Bets on $1.5 Trillion of Tax Cuts in Quest for Growth The Future of Boosters Is Somewhere Between Unnecessary and Urgent A Once Radical Idea to Close the Wealth Gap Is Actually Happening ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•6 hours ago,"China Sees ‘Unprecedented’ Capital Outflow Since War, IIF Says",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-sees-unprecedented-capital-outflow-140808712.html
