3/18/2022,"It is that time of the Six Nations for mulling over what might have been – and, for the lucky few, what could still follow. Coaches and players may insist on the sanctity of the “Next Match”, but the rest of us stand on the edge of the final round and work through the agonies of the past and future. Scotland will be fairly tearing themselves apart over the review of yet another championship of disappointment, but it is true they have not had to wait till the last round for that. Even Ireland, though, might harbour a few regrets. They still do have it all to play for when Scotland visit Dublin, but they languish for now in that purgatory of a fate surrendered to others. Andy Farrell makes three changes to the side that claimed a bitter-sweet victory in Twickenham. Iain Henderson starts for the first time in the second row, although he played all but the first 82 seconds against England, following James Ryan’s withdrawal with a head injury from the incident that saw Charlie Ewels sent off. Elsewhere, Jack Conan returns at No 8, with Caelan Doris reverting to flanker, meaning Peter O’Mahony steps back to the bench. These are simply adjustments from a position of strength, which highlight the depth of options available to Farrell. Further evidence of this can be found in the three-quarters. Andrew Conway makes way for Mack Hansen because of a knee injury, but Hansen had been one of the stars of Ireland’s first three rounds, which also happened to be his first three Tests. Then Conway was given a run for the pivotal Twickenham showdown last week and emerged as one of Ireland’s best performers. All of which begs the question, why is Ireland’s fate in the hands of others? To which one reply might be, the first five minutes of their 30-24 defeat in Paris. Or another might be, inaccuracy at crucial moments later in the game. It might be harsh to criticise Ireland unduly for falling victim to the same brilliant opening by the French that the other home nations have suffered so far, but – again like the others – they worked their way back into contention without quite finishing the job. Farrell will be as frustrated as millions of others by the red cards that placed asterisks next to the two wins that followed. Red cards might not “ruin” matches, whatever that means, but they transform their dynamics, affecting the mindset of everyone, including the team who benefit, and artificially compromising the elemental question in sport of which team has played the better. Ireland’s wins in rounds three and four, against 13 and 14 men respectively, were of the job-done variety, but Farrell will have wanted tests more meaningful by which to gauge the reaction to defeat in Paris. Will Ireland have that opportunity in the final round against Scotland? Assuming no further red cards, which is a dangerous presumption these days, a casual observer could be forgiven for thinking not. The cold, hard facts show Scotland have not won in Dublin since 2010. And that was at Croke Park. They have not won at Lansdowne Road since 1998. In the 11 Six Nations encounters since 2010, Scotland have won twice, the last five years ago. There is something about the meaty substance of recent Ireland teams that Scotland do not respond well to, even when they are not coping with the crushing disappointment of another championship gone by. Their headline selection for this one is that of Blair Kinghorn at fly-half. This is accommodated by the dropping of Finn Russell. Gregor Townsend is at pains to underplay the significance of the selection, but it is impossible not to speculate whether this marks a change in policy, an attempt to break from the most recent characterisation of Scotland as brilliant but brittle. Russell has time yet to make that last transition of the genius fly-half into the match-shaping one, which some geniuses achieve in their later years. He and Townsend, who managed that transition himself, have not always seen eye to eye. Now Scotland’s coach turns to the elegant Kinghorn, more usually a full-back or winger in the past. There is something about him of Stephen Larkham, another who made that transition, albeit from the position of genius full-back. Whether Scotland start to make the transition to consistently winning team in Dublin this weekend feels unlikely. If Ireland win, it would be over to Paris, where defeat for France would see Farrell’s side crowned champions.",Sport/Sport,Ireland can mull mistakes but Six Nations win still possible | Michael Aylwin,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/18/ireland-can-mull-mistakes-but-six-nations-win-still-possible

3/18/2022,"Marcus Brigstocke’s drama begins disarmingly: Benedict reads a “last bequest” letter from his father, whose wake takes place upstairs while Benedict is in the cellar surrounded by 948 bottles of his dad’s fine wines. That last detail becomes key when we learn that Benedict is a recovering alcoholic who was an addict by 17 but now, at 43, has been sober for half his lifetime. His father’s letter instructs him to open up an expensive bottle and drink to their relationship. The play comprises an imagined conversation between Benedict (Sam Alexander) and the ghost of his father (played by the actor’s father, Bruce Alexander). The last request is at once a celebration of life, a devilish temptation and an affront, given Benedict’s history of addiction. It leads to a dark night of the soul, although there is warm repartee between father and son along the way. The chemistry between the actors is natural, and while it is clear that the father is an inner voice, his role turns more cajoling and manipulative to reflect the self-sabotaging thoughts of an addict: “I think you’d be OK,” he says to Benedict. Having premiered on BBC Radio 4 in 2017, The Red has all the markings of an audio play. It is confined to a single conversation, with little movement between characters, although the cellar occasionally doubles up as an imaginary Alcoholics Anonymous circle. As staged and streamed by Original Theatre Company, under the direction of Charlotte Peters, it is an achievement that it does not feel static. It is also gripping, even if it feels ultimately like a chamber piece with the potential to go deeper. Grief is loosely tied with the wish to drink and this might have been better explored, along with some other threads of conversation that are dropped too quickly. One potentially interesting theme is Benedict’s AA circle and the necessary submission to a “higher power” as part of the 12-step “brand”. Another lost moment comes when the father asks Benedict why he became a teenage alcoholic: “Did we make you one, your mother and I?” he wonders. But this question is not explored either. It means that the drama feels limited, its characterisation and story smaller than it might have been. But it is excellent at unpicking the psychology of addiction. Brigstocke has spoken of his former drink and food addictions, and Benedict’s character incorporates both a sense of self-control and the insecurity of tipping back into a self-destructive life at any moment. It feels an immensely timely work, during the pandemic, when addictions may have been inflamed. “The disease of addiction never goes away,” reflects Benedict, who compares it to a sleeping tiger, only emerging stronger when it is stirred awake. We feel the tension as Benedict uncorks the bottle and almost swoons at the sight of the wine. The “will he or won’t he” drama of whether he will take that first, possibly deadly sip goes around in circles yet still holds us gripped until the last, uncertain moments.

3/18/2022,"Rishi Sunak has said going from “crisis to crisis” has been “not great” for Boris Johnson or anyone else, as the chancellor signalled an end to tax rises and more help for struggling families in next week’s spring statement. Sunak gave his outlook at the Conservatives’ spring conference in Blackpool, where he was interviewed by a fellow Tory MP, Paul Maynard, who asked him how he had coped with “one thing after another” including the Covid pandemic, supply chain disruption and the war in Ukraine. Pressed on how difficult it had been to get perspective with “so much going on”, Sunak told the audience of party members: “It has been a little bit, for all of us actually – the prime minister more than anyone – just crisis to crisis. It feels like that, which isn’t great. I mean, it’s not great for any of us.” His comments came as the party attempted to use its spring conference to draw a line under the prime minister’s rocky start to the year, which led to Tory attempts to oust him over lockdown-defying parties in Downing Street. Earlier, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexit minister, appeared to dismiss the partygate furore as “fluff” compared with the conflict in Ukraine, while Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, told the audience he thought the pandemic was difficult but realised he did not have “the first clue about what tough is” when speaking to his Ukrainian counterpart. Sunak, considered a frontrunner to be the next Tory leader, did not mention the various troubles facing the prime minister, who is still under police investigation over the No 10 parties. But in his interview with Maynard, he gave strong hints that he may take action to help with the cost of living in the spring statement. He is thought to be weighing up cutting fuel duty as petrol and diesel prices hit record highs. He told the audience tax rises were “done” and “difficult decisions” were over, after the national insurance rise that would come into force in April, coinciding with high inflation and rising energy bills. He said he had “sympathy” for those struggling with the cost of living in the face of “global inflationary forces”, and would consider taking action “where we can make a difference”. Sunak promised at the last budget that he wanted to cut taxes in the future, but he restated that aim even more strongly in Blackpool. “I made this very clear at the budget in the autumn, that is done. We’ve made the difficult decisions that we have to make. My priority going forward is to cut taxes,” he said.",News/Politics,Rishi Sunak: crisis after crisis has been ‘not great’ for Boris Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/18/rishi-sunak-crisis-after-crisis-has-been-not-great-for-boris-johnson
3/18/2022,"Everyone has one bit (OK, at least one bit) of the old normal they never want to go back to. Three-day hen weekends, maybe, or gym equipment filmy with the sweat of strangers. For me, funnily enough, it’s a fashion thing. What I never, ever want to go back to is carrying an overspill bag. For years I was a committed overspill bag woman. You know the type – wallet, phone and lip balm in her smart handbag or crossbody bag but with a lumpy tote bag slung over one shoulder. This bag might contain, say, my gym trainers and a garden trowel I needed to return to a friend, or a book I was determined to finish before book club and a plastic tub of last night’s risotto to eat at my desk while finishing said book in a 15-minute microlunch break. When I worked only from home, I didn’t need an overspill bag. I barely needed a handbag. Now I am back in the office some of the time, I am unwilling to go back to spending every commute looking like my luggage broke on the way back from a weekend minibreak. I want to at least aim for balance – and saying goodbye to a cheap, uncomfortable bag that gives me back pain is a start. In the era of hybrid working, what is the perfect hybrid handbag? I’m backing a structured tote. Something roomy, but soft and lightweight. This is where you’re thinking: OK, that’s fine, I’ve got loads of fabric tote bags stuffed in the kitchen drawer … I’m sorry to tell you that’s not what I’m talking about. Those floppy fabric things? Nope. That’s a tote, but it’s not the answer to your hybrid prayers. Your hybrid handbag needs a certain gravitas. It should help you feel like your day is manageable and your schedule is under control. Leather or what the youngsters call “vegan leather” (fake leather to oldies) is good. The Telfar Tote, otherwise known as the Brooklyn Birkin, gets a lot of eye-roll reaction by those who think it’s too-cool-for-school hype, but in its lightweight fabrication, comfortable handles and well-thought-out pockets, it is damn near perfect. Kurt Geiger’s recycled square shopper, made of quilted recycled black nylon, has a pleasingly Prada-adjacent vibe for a fraction of the cost. You don’t want lots of bells and whistles, but a few punctuating details – a little hardware, perhaps where the straps join the bag, like on All Saints’ Edbury shoulder bag – is good. Boden and Jigsaw are good labels to try. Rather than shell out for a logo, think about investing in your own initials. There are excellent monogrammed leather totes to be had on Etsy. I don’t have a label snob bone in my body, but a strap that breaks can derail a whole day and a bag that has been thought through – comfortable straps, secure inner pockets – is essential. Preloved is a no-brainer. That gorgeous, porridgy leather that Mulberry uses looks more refined the older it gets – the Dorset tote, with postman’s lock for security, is worth stalking on Vestiaire Collective or wherever you get your preloved fashion. The right bag is simple, really. It should feel as natural to pick up on days when you leave the kitchen table only to pop out for a pint of milk as it does in the meeting room when you swing by the office. It should help you feel properly dressed in a restaurant and be comfortable enough that you can walk home, shoes permitting. It should do everything – without trying to do everything all at once. Can we make that the new normal, please?",Lifestyle/Fashion,I’m ditching the overspill tote – one bag is better than two | Jess Cartner-Morley,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/18/im-ditching-the-overspill-tote-one-bag-is-better-than-two
3/18/2022,"Rescue workers are continuing to search for survivors in the ruins of a theatre that was being used as a shelter when it was blown apart by a Russian airstrike in the besieged southern city of Mariupol. Missiles have struck an aircraft repair facility in Lviv in the west, and civilian targets continue to be bombarded in cities around Ukraine. Hundreds of civilians were said to have taken shelter in the theatre in Mariupol when it was hit on Wednesday. On Friday, their fate was still uncertain. Local officials said Russian airstrikes also hit a municipal swimming pool complex in the city. A satellite photograph from Monday showed the word “children” in large Russian script painted on the ground outside the red-roofed theatre building. In Lviv, a facility for repairing military aircraft was hit by two cruise missiles fired from the Black Sea on Friday morning. Ukrainian officials said they had shot down a further four missiles launched in the attack. At least 35 people were killed on Sunday when more than 30 Russian cruise missiles targeted the nearby training base in Yavoriv. Elsewhere, early-morning barrages hit residential buildings in the Podil neighbourhood of Kyiv and in the eastern city of Kramatorsk. In Kharkiv, a massive fire raged through a local market after shelling on Thursday. Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
3/18/2022,"The Royal Opera’s new Peter Grimes is a co-production with Madrid’s Teatro Real, where it was first seen, and hugely admired, last year. Conducted by Mark Elder, directed by Deborah Warner, and superbly cast, with Allan Clayton tremendous in the title role, it’s an angry, confrontative, rightly unsettling interpretation of Britten’s first great examination of the relationship between the outsider and society. Warner hauls the opera into the here and now, reimagining The Borough as a decayed, isolated coastal town in post-Brexit Britain, a place of boarded-up shop fronts and desperate poverty where hatred, blame and prejudice fester amid the deprivation, and where a loner such as Clayton’s Grimes almost inevitably becomes the victim of a community looking for a scapegoat. Warner’s approach is by no means naturalistic, though: the Prologue is staged as an expressionist dream as Grimes sleeps on the shore and an aerialist (Jamie Higgins) hovers overhead as thoughts of his first apprentice’s horrific death begin to erode Grimes’s mind. The inhabitants of this hellhole, meanwhile, are characterised in often painstaking detail, down to every last member of the chorus, and much of the production’s power derives from Warner’s exploration of the way individuality becomes subsumed into the collective when mob violence takes over. Far-right thugs, lurking among the crowd, harass and threaten Maria Bengtsson’s affectionate Ellen for taking Grimes’s side. Bryn Terfel’s assertive yet compassionate Balstrode is the only person this community seemingly respects. Just occasionally, though, the updating grates against the work: that Grimes should have boy apprentices, in particular, comes over as anachronistic in the new context. Musically, it’s often astonishing, with Clayton and Elder (the latter conducting the work for the first time in the UK) effectively the evening’s heroes. In what is arguably the finest performance of his career to date, Clayton makes a heartbreaking, supremely lyrical Grimes, singing with remarkable sensitivity and great refinement of tone. Now the Great Bear and Pleiades, done cowering against the pub door with his back to the audience, is a ravishing exploration of the visionary, poetic soul beneath the man’s rough exterior. Elder, meanwhile, emphasises the score’s beauty as well as its violence. Textures are lean and sinewy rather than post-Romantic and full. Berg’s influence is very apparent, as is Britten’s debt to Strauss in the Act II quartet. Though her voice is not large, Bengtsson makes a fine Ellen, self-assured and dignified even when victimised. Her Embroidery Aria is exquisitely done. Terfel’s worldly-wise Balstrode is exemplary, too, sung and acted with admirable warmth and restrained intensity. The inhabitants of the Borough are played by a fine ensemble of singers, though Jacques Imbrailo’s handsome, wide-boy Ned Keene and John Graham-Hall’s truly alarming Bob Boles are particularly outstanding. The choral singing is wonderful.  At Royal Opera House, London, until 31 March. It is being recorded for streaming at a future date.

3/18/2022,"The streets are quiet. The beaches are inaccessible. Theatres, museums, schools, gyms and libraries are shut. Hong Kong is going round in circles, closing down and opening up just a little bit, in an endless loop that has everybody feeling claustrophobic. For more than two years, the city’s success in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic relied not on vaccinations, but almost entirely on keeping the virus out, and making it hard for people to get together in large groups. Now the virus has breached the defences – and we’re paying the price. At the beginning of the pandemic, Hong Kong’s biggest political upheaval in decades was still under way, with daily protests, at times violent, and countless arrests. The health crisis allowed for the imposition of emergency measures that kept the virus at bay – along with crowds of people. For most of the past two years, no more than four people could meet up in public; now that number is two. It has been difficult to disentangle the measures taken to prevent illness from those taken to prevent political protests – and this mix has bred a toxic mistrust. Still, the restrictions contained the virus. Living in Hong Kong felt a bit like being in a strange bubble. Leaving the city was not easy – the former transportation hub is still far behind pre-pandemic flight levels, and an airline that comes bearing Covid-positive passengers can be banned for a fortnight. Travellers languish in quarantine hotels (it used to be three weeks, now it has been shortened to two) adding considerable costs to anyone who would like a holiday or to visit friends and family abroad. Going across the border to mainland China is not easy, either, as the crossing still has not been reopened. So-called “ambush lockdowns” happen regularly, when all of a sudden entire residential blocks are cut off and reopened only when everyone inside has been tested. All of this was the price to pay in pursuit of “zero Covid”. It was tough, but the numbers were kept low. The absence of an exit strategy, however, has made the economic cost painfully high, with businesses going under and one-way departures from the city becoming a heartbreaking norm. Many have left to escape from the political stagnation in which Hong Kong now finds itself, in particular after the national security law (NSL) was imposed by Beijing in June 2020. This introduced vaguely defined crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign collusion, which have caused much concern. It has led to the closing down of many local and international NGOs, the disbanding of a major trade union and a chilling effect on news organisations. When disaster struck in the form of thousands of new Covid cases every day, Hong Kong simply no longer had the various communication channels that unions, independent media and grassroots-level councillors could provide. This has meant that in a moment of crisis the Hong Kong government could only rely on its own, not always trusted, channels to communicate new anti-pandemic measures, explain the need for vaccinations and help those who found it hard to navigate the emergency. (Many local politicians have been disqualified from standing for office, while 47 of the most prominent opposition figures find themselves awaiting trail for alleged crimes relating to the NSL.) Eventually, the virus made its way into the city through community infection – strict anti-Covid measures were never going to be impenetrable for ever – allowing the more contagious Omicron variant a foothold. And so, a population that had felt very little need to vaccinate itself in the absence of local cases was hit as strongly as the rest of the world was two years ago. By way of comparison, New Zealand, which also attempted a zero-Covid strategy, has a 2% unvaccinated rate among the over-80s; in Hong Kong, when this latest wave hit, 66% of over-80s had not been vaccinated. There are relatively low levels of immunity from previous infection among the population, and sub-par official messaging has meant that vaccine hesitancy has not been seriously addressed. In less than two months, Hong Kong has run out of coffins and space in the morgue. Pictures of sick elderly patients on hospital beds outdoors – and of body bags piling up next to patients in a chaotic hospital ward – have shocked the population. In recent days Hong Kong has had the highest mortality rate since the beginning of the pandemic anywhere in the world. What’s more, there are fewer and fewer people left to ask the authorities hard questions – accountability has never felt further out of reach. The way forward is still unclear. And all this at a time when Hong Kong is supposed to be preparing for the festivities around the 25th anniversary of its handover to China on 1 July – festivities that will, of course, be free of those pesky pro-democracy protesters.

The memorial is only the second statue of a named, real woman to be placed in an outdoor space in Wales and comes six months after the first – to Wales’ pioneering black headteacher Betty Campbell – was unveiled in Cardiff. A group called Monumental Welsh Women, which aims to erect five statues honouring women at five Welsh locations within five years, is behind both statues. Born in 1920 into a mining family in Hopkinstown, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Morgan went on to win a scholarship to Oxford. After graduating, she returned to south Wales where she taught, raised three sons and began writing plays to make ends meet. Her first scripts were accepted before she even had a television set and she is best known for the 1970s series How Green Was My Valley. She challenged accepted theories of human evolution, arguing in her book The Descent of Woman that there had been too much focus on the male hunter and that females were an equally vital part of the story. The book, published 50 years ago, was a global bestseller and became a key text in the women’s liberation movement. Despite her fame, she never abandoned her valleys roots and her bronze statue, crafted by the sculptor Emma Rodgers, was unveiled outside a doctor’s surgery close to her family home. Helen Molyneux, the founder of Monumental Welsh Women, said: “Our mission is to celebrate female ambition and success by commemorating the achievements of great Welsh women – and to inspire the next generation of great Welsh women. “Elaine was a wonderful dramatist and feminist icon, and we are thrilled to be able to immortalise her achievements so that she will be remembered in her home town and beyond for years to come. We hope her statue will act as an inspiration to the girls – and boys – of Mountain Ash and everyone who sees her.” Morgan was 92 when she died in 2013 and her son, Gareth Morgan, said she would have been delighted that the achievements of Welsh women were being celebrated through the statue campaign. He said: “Elaine’s work has helped to inspire women everywhere and I have seen messages from women all over the world who wrote to thank her for changing their lives. “Some had been inspired to forge a career in science, while others took up writing or some other long-held ambition after reading her books, and they all expressed how she had changed their view of women, of science and of themselves. “Elaine has been called a campaigner for women’s equality, but secretly I think she believed in women’s superiority.”",News/UK news,Statue unveiled of Welsh writer and feminist Elaine Morgan,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/18/statue-unveiled-of-welsh-writer-and-feminist-elaine-morgan
