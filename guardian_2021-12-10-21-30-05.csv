12/10/2021,"Kirill Karabits has been chief conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra since 2008 but, as far as London concert-goers are concerned, he remains something of an unknown quantity. While he has regularly brought the Bournemouth orchestra to the Proms, he has otherwise made disappointingly few guest appearances with the capital’s orchestras. But with Simon Rattle isolating in Berlin after testing positive for Covid-19, Karabits stepped in for the series of concerts with the London Symphony Orchestra that Rattle was due to conduct this month, leaving the scheduled programmes unchanged, including this pairing of works by Hungarian expatriates, Bartók’s Concerto for Orchestra and the violin concerto by Miklós Rózsa. Rózsa is best remembered now for his film scores – nearly 100 of them, including the music for Ivanhoe, Ben-Hur and El Cid – but he made a point of spending three months of every year writing for the concert hall, and composed his violin concerto in 1953 for Jascha Heifetz. It’s a hefty, half-hour work, vividly scored, with immense technical challenges for the soloist – never profound music, but always dazzlingly effective, and a perfect showcase for Heifetz’s virtuosity. The themes have a distinctly Hungarian flavour: the opening echoes that of Bartók’s second violin concerto, and passages in the finale recall Zoltán Kodály’s orchestral music. The soloist was the LSO’s leader, Roman Simović, who apparently had been introduced to the work by Rattle. Simović had obviously taken to the piece – his performance had all the gutsy intensity and soaring lyricism that anyone could possibly want.  If it was hard to imagine a better performance of Rózsa’s concerto, then Karabits’ account of Bartók’s all-too-familiar Concerto for Orchestra was pretty exceptional as well. There was real drama and tension in the opening movement, edgy playfulness in the duetting of the second, moody bleakness in the central elegy, and a finale that steadily ratcheted up the excitement. The orchestral playing was consistently brilliant; Karabits should be a regular visitor to the LSO from now on.",Arts/Music,LSO/Karabits review – stand-in for Rattle proves himself more than equal to the task,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/10/lso-karabits-barbican-review-bartok-rozsa-roman-simovic
12/10/2021,"On the second floor of the Reina Sofía Museum in Madrid, not far from Picasso’s huge and ever-livid Guernica, hangs a much smaller but equally eloquent testament to the civilian cost of the Spanish civil war. Robert Capa’s photograph of No 10 Peironcely Street in the working-class Madrid barrio of Vallecas in the early winter of 1936, measures just 29.4cm by 40.2cm. Three children sit on the pavement in front of a shrapnel-gnawed house, smiling amid the rubble left by the German bombers Hitler sent to support Gen Franco’s coup.  While Picasso’s picture will always be far better known, Capa’s image – now on permanent show at the Reina Sofía after an exhaustive, 10-year reorganisation of the museum’s collection – has enjoyed a potent afterlife. First published exactly 85 years ago in the French magazine Regards, it dragged the world’s gaze towards Spain and the aerial atrocities that would become commonplace just a few years later during the second world war. It has also helped in the 21st century to find decent accommodation for those who had been living in cramped and miserable conditions in the building Capa chanced upon after the bombing raid. In March, after a long campaign by a community platform backed by the trade union Fundación Anastasio de Gracia, the 13 families who lived there were finally moved into new flats. The building itself has been shuttered until it enters a new phase as a museum – “the Robert Capa centre for the interpretation of the aerial bombing of Madrid”. Members of the Save Peironcely 10 group had written to the director of the Reina Sofía, Manuel Borja-Villel in October urging him to ensure the copy of the photograph given to the museum in 1998 by Capa’s brother, Cornell, was granted a permanent exhibition space, but it proved unnecessary – the museum authorities had already decided to hang the photo among alongside works by Le Corbusier, Joan Miró and others, in a room called Spain, Tragic Myth. “The photo was always going to be put on show again,” Borja-Villel says. “I believe that works of art, or poetry, or cultural in general, can help us see reality differently – and that’s performative and changes and affects our lives. For us, that’s exactly what this little photo has done.” In any case, he adds, “I would have signed the letter myself because I’m totally in agreement with it”. Borja-Villel says the reorganisation – or “rereading” – of the museum’s collection is the result of a decade’s work to ensure the Reina Sofía lives up to its responsibilities as a 21st-century cultural institution. About 70% of the 2,000 works now on display have never been shown before, allowing the museum to broaden its exploration of questions such as migration, colonialism, gender and the environment, to incorporate architectural elements, and to include more female artists. The aim of the reorganisation – called Communicating Vessels, 1881-2021 – is also to reflect on society’s relationship with art, and on art’s relationship with museums. In an era of cyberspace, fake news and raging culture wars, says Borja-Villel, we need to think about information and how it reaches us. “We seem to be living in a loop where the future is presented as a dystopia and the past as an idealised past, with some pretty complicated or xenophobic biases such as the idea of a land of one’s own,” says Borja-Villel. “In that context, I think museums have an important role in explaining how we receive our ideas and our perceptions of the world – because that reception is never neutral.” The director is also keen for the museum to encompass recent socioeconomic changes, not least the 2008 financial crisis that brought Spain to the brink and profoundly altered its political landscape. “All of a sudden, that neoliberal, selfish, individual, entrepreneurial system we’d had since the 1970s fell apart and failed spectacularly,” he says. “And we saw the appearance of other alternatives right around the world, such as the indignados movement here.” Humanity’s impact on the environment is pithily catalogued in photographs of the calamitous Prestige oil spill in 2002, while the large number of works by Latin American artists raises questions about colonialism, migration, exile and cultural imperialism. “We’ve always seen things – and museums – as being bound up with territory,” says Borja-Villel. “But we need to decolonise our thinking and understand that Europe and the west are just provinces of the world. We need to understand there’s an element of structural violence in colonisation.” The director also points out that while the newly rejigged collection ends with works by three female artists – Victoria Gil, Joan Jonas and Carmen Laffón – far more needs to be done to recognise and retrieve the achievements of generations of creative women. “They were obviously always there, but we didn’t always know how to see them properly,” he says. “We need to change the way we look at things and incorporate female artists. It’s very easy in the contemporary part, but harder historically, because in the past, women were pushed to the edge.” And, although it’s early days, Borja-Villel says visitor numbers suggest the reorganisation is going down very well with the public. The museum’s attendance figures will swell a little further on Friday afternoon when a delegation from the Save Peironcely group, headed by the former Unesco chief Federico Mayor Zaragoza and the Irish Hispanist and writer Ian Gibson, arrives to see the Capa picture in situ on the 85th anniversary of its publication. “We’re so happy and proud that all the stories behind the photographed are being recognised,” says José María Uría Fernández of the Fundación Anastasio de Gracia. “The image, which became a global reference point for horror, is now where it should be – and very close to Guernica itself. It’s amazing how a tiny negative has managed to generate a wave that’s helped change the lives of so many people so many years later.”",News/World news,Reina Sofia Museum reorganisation brings tiny photo to the fore,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/reina-sofia-museum-reorganisation-robert-capa-photo
12/10/2021,"You may not have noticed, owing to all the noise about the party-that-wasn’t, but on Wednesday the foreign secretary, Liz Truss – a potential successor to Boris Johnson should he ever, heaven forfend, lose the confidence of the Tory Party – warned us all about the future of the world. Democrats were losing ground, she said, in a speech at the Chatham House thinktank in London. Those who believed in freedom must stand up and be counted if they were to ensure “democracies don’t just survive, they thrive”. In this, she is right: democracy is under attack everywhere, with kleptocrats such as Vladimir Putin amassing ever more wealth, power and influence while western governments squabble over things such as inshore fishing rights.  As such, her speech was an important warning, except for one startling omission: Britain is a primary enabler of the autocrats she is so worried about; we are butler to the world’s worst people. Our shell companies hide their money, our private schools educate their children, our lawyers defend their reputations, our financial markets fund their companies, and our banks launder their money. It’s absurd to talk about the threat that dictators pose to our democracy without acknowledging how without our assistance they wouldn’t be a threat at all. It’s like condemning a war without mentioning you supplied the weapons, or criticising a party that took place in your own house. She boasted of Britain’s place in Nato, of its development aid, of its “cyber-security partnerships”, yet all of the problems that these interventions are supposed to solve are worsened by the unregulated financial system centred on the City. The Russian kleptocrats whom Nato is opposing keep most of their wealth offshore, with houses in London their favourite assets and City lawyers their tireless defenders. The aid payments that go to help the crises in Nigeria, South Sudan or Libya are just sticking plasters over wounds worsened by entrenched corruption, again enabled through the UK. Hackers who defraud people of billions of pounds a year launder their money through our poorly regulated economy. Of course, Britain is not the only place that moves this money or serves these criminals, but this government is increasingly an outlier in its failure to acknowledge our role. This week, Joe Biden’s White House published a lengthy, thoughtful and impressive strategy on tackling corruption, which it has identified as a security priority, since kleptocracy empowers the nation’s enemies and weakens its friends. “Corrupt actors hide their money in the United States all the time. We can no longer provide them a shadow under which to operate,” wrote the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, and the USAID administrator Samantha Power in an article announcing the strategy. “Combating corruption abroad, therefore, begins at home, and our first step must be to expose the owners of shell companies and other illicit funds.” In contrast to that, Truss ignored a question from the audience on the British role in laundering money after her speech at Chatham House, choosing instead to talk about how we shouldn’t talk about the empire. If she’d only hung around until after lunch, however, she would have realised quite how colossal her omission was, since on Wednesday Chatham House also hosted the launch of a major report by a group of academics that forensically dissected Britain’s role in enabling corruption, and came to conclusions that were all the more alarming for the sober language they were described in. “The UK has a kleptocracy problem,” they wrote. “The country’s international reputation has already been undermined by the inflow of suspect capital from the servicing of post-Soviet elites. Beyond this question of image, there are serious questions to consider of the integrity of the UK’s public institutions and the equitability of its laws.” This isn’t just one problem, though: it is a whole ecosystem, with each aspect sustaining the others in an interconnected and impenetrable web. Ferocious lawyers protect the kleptocrats’ dirty money from scrutiny by underfunded police officers by hiding it in crooked banks behind impenetrable shell companies from offshore territories so it can be spent in prestigious establishments on luxury goods to be stored in top-end property. Meanwhile, when amoral reputation managers threaten nosy journalists with ruinous lawsuits, leading institutions accept it and label their generous donors “philanthropists”, and light-fingered politicians do nothing to upend this whole profitable system. Truss boasted of Britain’s soft power – “from the Beatles to Sarah Gilbert to Tim Berners-Lee” – but our most significant influence on the world right now lies in our world-class enablers, who protect anyone willing to pay their fees from the consequences of their actions, and leave everyone else behind. Looked at globally, Britain’s primary role is not as a champion of democracy, helping ensure that everyone is equal before the law and has a say in how those laws are created, but a genuine threat to it. What is depressing is that not much more than five years ago the British government seemed to understand this. It convened a major anti-corruption summit in London, and wrote draft laws that would actually help drive dirty money out of the country. It is only under Boris Johnson that it has lost interest in the matter. If Truss actually wants to do something for democracy, she could pick up those bills – one reforming Companies House, the other exposing the real people behind the 100,000-odd UK properties owned by shell companies – and get them turned into law. There is plenty more that needs doing, from adequately funding our law enforcement agencies to overhauling our convoluted anti-money laundering regulators, but that would be a step towards driving kleptocratic cash out of the country, and turning Britain into a genuine champion of liberty.

12/10/2021,"UK government officials were in Tehran last week discussing legal ways to pay Britain’s historical £400m debt to Iran, the Iranian ambassador to London has said. Mohsen Baharvand added he was in live discussions with the Foreign Office over the issue, adding the issues were not insurmountable.  The UK Foreign Office has refused to discuss any details of the payment to Iran, or what has been holding up the settling of the £400m debt dating back to an arms sale to Iran in the mid-1970s. Families of the UK dual nationals detained in Iran have repeatedly said they believe their family members are being held hostage until the debt is paid. The former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has also said he does not think the UK dual nationals will be released until the debt is paid. Baharvand, speaking to reporters in London on Friday, said Iran and the UK had been close to an agreement on the debt in the summer. “We wanted to use that deal to ask our people that we are seeing a good sign from the UK and then that gives us a possibility to expedite our efforts to help the dual nationals and things like that. Then we had a deal. We signed it but two days after the signature of that deal the UK government said they could not implement it because of US sanctions. “We are trying. We should not be that pessimistic. We are working with our Foreign Office colleagues maybe to reach that deal. We are in the process of discussions. Last week there was a delegation from the UK in Iran and personally I was talking to the Foreign Office and I am hopeful we will reach an agreement.” Referring to reports that the money could be paid in the form of humanitarian aid, he said: “It’s not aid. Our money is here and we want our money. That is very simple. We want to receive our money. We are not insisting on interest. Otherwise it would be billions. We are talking to our UK colleagues as to which channel is the most probable to transfer that money to our accounts.” Asked if the US could give a letter of comfort to the UK to guarantee that the payment would not be sanctioned, he said: “The US are not doing that. They have to help the UK government to do that. It is not impossible. Obstacles are not insurmountable, but we have to discuss, negotiate and find a way. We are now discussing through what channel that money be transferred. There is a negotiating process now.” He also stressed that the issue of the detainees’ release was a matter for the Iranian judiciary, and could not be mixed up with the wider issue of the Iran nuclear talks in Vienna. The Foreign Office has been contacted for comment. In a question and answer session at the thinktank Chatham House this week, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, acknowledged that the UK owed the debt. She has met the families of two UK-Iranian dual national detainees, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori.

12/10/2021,"Mike Bartlett wrote Mrs Delgado during lockdown, after a period of struggling to put pen to paper, and it has the gleeful glow of someone returning to what they love. The story and characters tumble out fully formed. The jokes feel effortless, the passion instinctive. It’s a heartfelt rallying cry for the importance of community, performed in one of the micro-communities that Bartlett most cherishes: the theatre. Ellen Robertson – who appeared in Bartlett’s 2018 Christmas play, Snowflake – has had to step into this one-woman play at the last minute and performs sitting at a stool with script in hand. As Robertson reads the play aloud, occasionally drinking from a mug decorated with unicorns, a subtle sense of magic emerges. It’s as if we’re all kids again, gathered at the library to listen to a story.  Robertson narrates as Helen, a young woman who becomes bizarrely fixated on her 80-something neighbour, Mrs Delgado, as lockdown takes its toll. It’s August 2020 but “Mrs D” (a nod to Woolf’s Dalloway?) is refusing to play by the rules. She’s inviting visitors inside, chatting to anyone who’ll listen and even hugging the Amazon delivery man. Mrs Delgado must be stopped. For her own good. You can almost hear Bartlett chuckling as he brings Mrs Delgado into being. With just a few careful observations and, in Robertson, a very funny and charismatic actor, Mrs Delgado bursts off the page. She sunbathes on a table. She stares up at the ceiling for a full four minutes. She wears red flowing dresses, bakes frozen-pea fruitcakes and dances in the street. Director Clare Lizzimore is careful not to overplay the script. As Helen’s eyes turn away from her closed world of Netflix, Tinder and Zoom, and turn towards the life that thrives just beyond her pulled-down blinds, Robertson brings an entire street to life. The conjuring of these characters never feels virtuosic. Instead, it feels effortless – a palpable demonstration of just how easy it is to create a community, given half a chance.

12/10/2021,"Future, the London-listed owner of magazines from Marie Claire to Metal Hammer, has told more than 1,000 members of staff that they must continue to come into the office, despite the latest government guidance to work from home where possible to contain the spread of Omicron. The publisher, which last month reported expectation-busting revenues and profits guaranteeing big bonuses for its top management, sent an email to its approximately 1,500 staff based in England telling them a shift to full working from home “is not something we can do”. The company employs 2,800 staff in total, with the US its other main market.  “There is a cost to our business of prolonged working from home,” wrote Future’s chief people officer, Hazel Boyle, in an email sent on Thursday and seen by the Guardian. “So while the government is recommending [work from home] ‘where you can’, we believe that full-time working from home is not something ‘we can’ do.” The company said that working from home affected “business performance, creativity and teamwork”, despite beating its own forecasts and increasing revenues by almost a quarter in the last year. It “ideally” wants staff in at least two days a week from Monday to “benefit from collaboration”. On Thursday, the UK reported almost 51,000 new cases of coronavirus, with 148 deaths, as the number of new cases of Omicron doubled in a day. “Our stance has always been that we will follow government guidelines,” the internal email continues. “So you might be asking why we are keeping the office open when the advice is to stay at home if you can. Plan B is a different government strategy from previous lockdowns because everything around us remains relatively the same – restaurants, shops, bars continue to operate in the lead-up to Christmas.” Staff have been coming in at least two days a week, more in some divisions, and are expected to move to three days a week in the new year. The company signed off by suggesting that people could only work from home full-time if they were “genuinely” not going out and socialising to limit the chance of catching Covid. “We know that there will be colleagues who are genuinely preserving the holiday season by not going out and about at all to places like restaurants, shops, bars etc so we are happy for them to include the workplace in that. As we have found out, catching Covid-19 is not restricted to just the office environment. “Should England move into a full lockdown we will of course reconsider this position,” said Boyle. The company said that additional health and safety measures would be introduced to offices “over the coming weeks”, including the reintroduction of social distancing, one-way systems, a two-person maximum limit in lifts, no more than four staff in a meeting room, and a negative lateral flow test before entering an office. However, the wearing of face masks around the office “will continue to be optional” – despite the government saying they should be worn in shops, on public transport as well as cinemas and theatres – although Boyle said staff should “exercise common sense” in communal spaces. A Future spokesperson said: “The health and safety of our colleagues is paramount, and we have introduced additional measures to support those who are in our offices in England. We will continue to monitor government guidance closely.” Next week, Future’s annual report will reveal that top managers including Zillah Byng-Thorne, the publisher’s chief executive, took home millions in pay, bonuses and incentive scheme awards this year. Last year, Byng-Thorne and the chief financial officer, Penny Ladkin-Brand, who is the second-highest paid executive at Future, took home a combined £5m.

12/10/2021,"“Iremember thinking: if we make it out alive, how and where are we going to start all over again?” said Vanessa Nieuwenhuizen, who dragged her children to safety through rapidly rising flood waters in Samoa. Others in the Guardian’s interviews with people with personal experience of the climate emergency also talked vividly of the bewilderment and grief caused by wildfires, flooding and drought, of livelihoods lost and lives turned upside down. “Every tree, every bush, every flower was burned and the whole ecosystem was wiped out,” recalled Antonis Vakos, a beekeeper from the island of Evia in Greece. For some the impact of extreme weather was sudden and catastrophic. For others it meant slow environmental degradation: entire ways of life gradually disappearing amid climate volatility, rising seas, and melting snow and ice. As Daharu Isah, a Nigerian farmer, expressed it: “The weather keeps playing tricks on me.”  In a year in which the real, human and ecological impact of global heating has been brought home to ever more of us – and when the choices facing a world teetering on the edge of irreparable climate disaster were starkly framed at the Cop26 conference in Glasgow – it seemed timely and right that we put the environment at the heart of the 2021 Guardian and Observer charity appeal. The thread running through our appeal is climate injustice. The stark truth is that the world’s developing countries have seen the vast majority of the death and destruction caused by climate-induced disasters, and yet they are responsible for a tiny fraction of global emissions. The richest countries pollute most but it is in the poorest where climate change is most harshly felt, through extreme poverty, food and water insecurity and the displacement of millions of people from their homes. Tackling such monumental injustice is an existential issue for the entire world, and a pressing moral obligation for the wealthiest countries. Set beside the vast and bold systemic and behavioural changes we urgently require, a charity appeal might seem relatively insignificant. As ever, however, we see the appeal as a statement of intent, a sign of our commitment to a fairer society; a show of solidarity with the victims of climate injustice; and an ovation for those who fight that injustice. This year we are supporting four fantastic charities, which in their different ways show how we can start to make a difference: Practical Action delivers locally run and sustainable plans to help communities adapt to climate change, from flood early warning systems to the introduction of climate-smart regenerative agricultural practices. The Environmental Justice Foundation puts human rights at the centre of its work securing protection for climate refugees – people displaced from their homes by extreme weather – and highlighting injustices such as illegal fishing and deforestation. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew is best known for its gardens in west London. Your donations will help fund its work protecting biodiversity and restoring denuded land on the island of Madagascar, which the World Food Programme reported is suffering from a famine linked to climate change. Global Greengrants Fund UK will work with international partners such as CLIMA Fund to regrant its share of your donations to grassroots projects at the sharp end of climate change in the global south. Since 2015, Guardian and Observer readers have raised just under £10m through our annual appeals. We’ve supported refugees, funded youth homelessness projects, and helped charities fighting Windrush immigration injustices. Last year we raised an incredible £1.4m for charities working with disadvantaged young people in the UK.

12/10/2021,"Climate justice is the theme of the Guardian and Observer’s 2021 charity appeal. We are supporting four charities that fight to protect the rights and livelihoods of communities hit by extreme weather events caused by the climate crisis.  Big change starts small is Practical Action’s approach to tackling the impact of the climate emergency and environmental degradation. As its name suggests, this UK-based charity specialises in hands-on, pragmatic ways of helping communities adapt to the challenge of extreme weather. It works with communities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to develop ingenious, lasting and locally owned solutions for people whose lives and livelihoods have been devastated by the climate crisis, helping to increase resilience through climate-smart, regenerative agriculture, waste management and access to clean energy. These solutions include introducing technology and mobilising communities to help local volunteers provide early warning of imminent flooding; providing irrigation and tree-planting to repair damage to forest and pastureland and helping farmers adapt to the changing climate by supplying climate-resilient seeds and developing new practices. Practical Action was established in 1966, after an article was published in the Observer by the radical green economist EF Schumacher (of Small Is Beautiful fame). He argued that economic development should be based around the holistic needs, skills and resources of local communities. “Our work remains grounded in the realities of people living in poverty, who face even more challenges from the devastating impacts of climate change, even though they have been the lowest contributors to the problem. We support communities so that they can thrive, rather than just survive. And we work with governments and businesses to ensure these changes are sustained and scaled,” said Sarah Roberts, chief executive of Practical Action. At the core of Environmental Justice Foundation’s mission is the belief that the climate crisis is a human rights concern, and that protecting the natural world is not just a question of “quality of life” but, for too many people, a matter of life and death. The UK-based charity has pioneered campaigning for climate refugees, giving voice to some of the planet’s most vulnerable people, and working to secure legal protection for communities for whom the climate crisis has destroyed their homes and livelihoods. Its investigative films and reports have highlighted a range of climate injustices and prompted local policy changes in areas from defending marine environments and tackling illegal fishing, to uncovering the ruinous impact of rising global demand for soy, palm oil and beef. “Whether working with local peoples to raise the alarm over destructive wildfires and illegal logging in Brazil; empowering coastal communities to rid their waters of illegal fishing in Liberia; or telling the stories of those who have lost their homes to the climate crisis in Bangladesh, our goal is the same: we take local fights for environmental justice and make them global; reaching the centre of governments and business, to drive action for people and planet,” said Steve Trent, its chief executive. The Indian Ocean island of Madagascar is one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots, famed for its natural wonders and yet facing acute challenges. Its unique plants, animals and fungi, and the 28 million people who live there, are increasingly threatened by drought and wildfires, famine and deforestation, driven by the climate crisis. Madagascar’s plight was highlighted at the recent Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow, which heard how climate-induced famine in the south of the island had forced people to move west and north, putting natural resources there under strain. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (RBG Kew), a UK-based science and conservation charity known for its famous gardens in south-west London, is helping tackle this. It’s had a large research presence on the island for nearly 40 years, and is at the forefront of initiatives there and globally to catalogue, understand and protect biodiversity. With many Malagasy people dependent on natural resources such as rosewood, yams, rice and vanilla for their livelihoods, the Kew Madagascar Conservation Centre has been working with local communities to develop resilient agricultural systems, restore denuded land, and protect the island’s abundant biodiversity. “Using our unique expertise in halting biodiversity loss and protecting precious habitats in Madagascar, we will use funding from the Guardian and Observer appeal to support and enhance the benefits of biodiversity to rural people, through projects planned and delivered in partnership with local communities,” said Paul Wilkin, head of ecosystem stewardship at RBG Kew. “We believe these projects have the potential to transform lives whilst protecting the country’s precious diversity.” Helping people and communities at the sharp end of the climate crisis to find their own solutions to the challenges of extreme weather and environmental degradation is the approach successfully championed by Global Greengrants Fund UK. Using its share of donations to this year’s Guardian and Observer appeal, Global Greengrants Fund UK will work in collaboration with the US-based non-profit CLIMA Fund to identify and award financial micro-grants to grassroots climate projects across Africa, Asia and South America. These will include projects that develop community-led resilience to climate impacts, protect the human rights of indigenous groups, address climate injustice and promote environmental initiatives, including water capture, tree-planting and the sustainable methods of agriculture. Global Greengrants Fund UK was a partner in the Guardian and Observer 2019 charitable appeal, when it regranted its £250,000 share of donations to support local rainforest protection groups in the Amazon basin. “Answers to the climate crisis exist. They are led by those who are most impacted by but least responsible for climate change: Indigenous peoples, women, youth, and rural communities. Together with our partners in the CLIMA Fund and our donors we are supporting these forces for change to protect our shared planet and call for climate justice,” said Eva Rehse, UK executive director of Global Greengrants Fund.

12/10/2021,"Dune reminds us what a Hollywood blockbuster can be. Implicitly, the message of Denis Villeneuve’s fantasy epic, written again and again in the sand, is that big-budget spectaculars don’t have to be dumb or hyperactive, that it’s possible to allow the odd quiet passage. Adapted from Frank Herbert’s 60s opus, Dune is dense, moody and quite often sublime – the missing link between the multiplex and the arthouse. Encountering it was like stumbling across some fabulous lost tribe, or a breakaway branch of America’s founding fathers who laid out the template for a different and better new world. Timothée Chalamet plays Paul Atreides, your archetypal hero, unsure of his powers and questioning the merits of the mountainous task before him. His father, the Duke (Oscar Isaac), has been handed stewardship of the desert planet Arrakis, source of a magical substance called “spice” that extends life and fuels space travel – all the good stuff. But Arrakis, though sandy, is not entirely deserted. It is home to vast worms that can rise up with little warning, and an oppressed people – the Fremen – who see the spice harvesters as exploiters.  The drama is played out with relish by an ensemble cast (Stellan Skarsgård, Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa), and Villeneuve is confident enough to let the temperature slowly build before the big, operatic set-pieces eventually break cover. He constructs an entire world for us here, thick with myth and mystery, stripped of narrative signposts or even much in the way of handy exposition. He has handed us a movie to map out at our leisure and figure out on the run: apparently spitting on someone is a gesture of respect on Arrakis, while walking sideways like a crab is the safest way to proceed.

12/10/2021,"Bridget Riley gave abstract art the neurological impact of a mind-altering substance six decades ago when she started painting black-and-white spirals, waves and folds that confuse perception. A new exhibition to mark her 90th birthday earlier this year is called Pleasures of Sight, but the happiness she provokes in us is really in our brains. The delight of Riley’s art comes from the way she can make the mind see mountains and valleys, vertigo-inducing swoops and sudden movements that are not there. She is the only British painter to change the history of abstract art. In the 1950s, the most exciting art in the world came from New York. Jackson Pollock, whose work made a huge impression on Riley when she saw his famous show at London’s Whitechapel Gallery in 1958, made painting feel like a living “action” instead of a framed picture: he and the other American action painters created art on an embracing scale, one that you could fall into. Riley felt its power yet changed its nature. Since the start of the 60s she has painted on that same big, open, potentially limitless scale yet with a scientific realism. Instead of relying on woozy romantic feeling, she aims for quantifiable, physical results.  Riley trained in a postwar Britain where “proper” art meant an accurate picture. She was a good student whose early portraits and life studies remain impressive. As a teenager she painted a copy of Jan van Eyck’s Portrait of a Man in a Red Turban in the National Gallery. She dived deep into the folds and shadows of the red headgear the man is wearing: like the 15th-century master, she was interested in the way paint can weave illusions of depth and solidity on a flat surface. Van Eyck was one of the first artists to paint convincing illusions of space. Perspective, the technique of doing this, is at the heart of Riley’s illusions. She, too, paints carefully calculated spatial fictions – but instead of convincing us we are looking at folded cloth or into a room, she makes us see bulbous projections and sublime chasms that break the veil between art and us, outer and inner experience. For all her science, she is a romantic at heart. Like her contemporaries who took LSD, she uses the brain’s chemistry to get at transcendental experiences. The mysticism in Riley’s modernism became increasingly apparent. In the later 1960s she moved away from the black-and-white “op art” she had become famous for, partly because she was disgusted to see her style copied in ads and department store windows. She began to paint equally rigorous but more subtle sweeps of alternating colour. 19th-century painter Georges Seurat is another of her influences: in 1960 she painted her own masterpiece of pixelated colour, a captivating Tuscan view called Pink Landscape. In her colour abstractions she creates magical, sizzling effects by setting greens, reds and purples side by side. How do Riley’s grand, intellectual developments over more than 60 years relate to the joys and vicissitudes of a life? Who knows. Without being reclusive, she has calmly rejected all the cliches of artistic fame, creating art that can seem utterly impersonal but always spiritually intense. The emotional highs and lows (mostly highs) are yours as you move through a room where her art hangs, feeling elated, liberated, and occasionally even seasick. She offers, not an introspective expressionist self-portrait, but a shared, universal music. An Ode to Joy.  Bridget Riley: Pleasures of Sight is at The Lightbox, Woking, 18 December to 10 April Movement in Squares, 1961 If there was ever an artist whose work you need to experience in its full glory in a physical space, it’s Riley. Yet Tthe eye-boggling psychedelic power of Movement in Squares is so infectious it even works on small scale in print or on screen. Your mind splits open as you gaze on this chessboard pattern that collapses into a diving chasm. Op – short for optical – was the glib name given to Riley’s shocks to perception. She became a star but this thinking persont, unwillingly sucked into pop culture, she lamented that: “It will take at least 20 years before anyone looks at my paintings seriously again.” It has been 60 years and Movement in Squares remains a masterpiece of modern art. Song of Orpheus IV, 1978 Your eyes get a slightly softer ride from these rivers and curls of green and pink. When Riley broke with her iconic black-and-white radicalism, she allowed new emotional dimensions into her painted cosmos. The unlikely colour combination here creates an almost folksy mood, a poignant delicacy, a mistiness. Then you follow the sinuous curves of those adjacent lines and enter a world that is just as perceptually odd as her earlier works. Ethereal and undulating, this is a piping, pastoral theme that could easily have been played to the animals by Orpheus in some Arcadian meadow. Ecclesia, 1985 It might seem that, since rejecting her early pop star fame, Riley has worked in isolation from her times. When she painted Ecclesia, she was a trustee of the National Gallery, and selected a show there of great colourists of the past, from Titian and Veronese, to Rubens and Poussin. Riley has recently reaffirmed her commitment to the old masters with a wall painting in the National Gallery’s lobby. Yet Ecclesia is nothing if not modern – and it seems rawly, brashly of its time, pulsing with the vulgar capitalist energy of 1980s Manhattan or London. You could play early electro-dance music against these vertical bars of merciless colour. Fête, 1989, top The artist who shook the swinging 60s is as sharp, new and relentless as ever as she enters another phase of pure abstraction. Riley’s life of looking at art and the world is in this cascading restless progress of coloured lozenges. Fête is a distillation of the nature of art itself: colour and movement flit through it as powerfully as they do in a huge oil painting of frolicking wine harvesters or a fresco of lovemaking gods. Riley’s deep knowledge of art, and deeper appetite for life, pulse within it.",Arts/Art and design,"Bridget Riley at 90: a master who can leave you feeling elated, liberated – and even seasick",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/dec/10/bridget-riley-at-90-a-master-who-can-leave-you-feeling-elated-liberated-and-even-seasick

12/10/2021,"Six by Nico was the busiest restaurant on Charlotte Street in London on a recent Saturday night, and the people at the front desk – you couldn’t really call them receptionists or even a maître d’, because the vibe here is much, much less structured than that – were fobbing off hopeful walk-ins by the dozen. Those who had already been disappointed stood outside in huddles, hungry and seemingly without a plan. Still, the fact that this street is hectic again after the past 18 months is a good news story. In the very nadir of last winter’s lockdown, Charlotte Street became a name I thought carefully about bringing up whenever I was discussing “the state of where we are” with food industry sorts. The truth was too brutal. Many of them hadn’t witnessed first-hand how this once-twinkly, charming thoroughfare, popular with Londoners as well as tourists, was now desolate, boarded-up, bin bag-laden and a sort of Spaghetti Junction for Fitzrovia’s foxes.  In this light, the much-loved, now closed Elena’s L’Etoile didn’t feel so much like another era, but almost fictitious. This hospitality institution and shameless celeb haunt lived at number 30, in various guises, for almost 100 years, and the tiny yet mighty Elena Salvoni ran the floor with abundant old-school dignity. I’m not entirely sure anyone ate at Elena’s solely for the food, although signed photos of the likes of Gene Wilder and Ella Fitzgerald pointed towards the fact that they’d been made to feel special and valued. Earlier this year, however, as Charlotte Street sat punch-drunk, shutters down and tables up, it felt as if we’d never see those heady days again.So it was cheering, 10 months later, to find Six By Nico almost directly opposite the old Elena’s site not just open, but way oversubscribed. The less fortunate news, which I’d realise over the ensuing 70 minutes, was that I actually had a reservation. If this is the future of hospitality, I’m going to retrain as a plumber. Chef Nico Simeone’s “concept” – a themed set six-course 30-something-quid menu that changes every six weeks – has been a huge hit in several cities since it launched in Glasgow in 2017; there are now eight branches across Liverpool, Edinburgh, Belfast, Manchester, London and, most recently, Dublin. Those themed menus so far have featured the likes of “The Mad Hatter’s Tea Party”, “Guilty Pleasures”, “The Orient Express” and, on the week I visited, “Paris”, apparently (next week sees them launch the latest theme, “A Miracle on … ”). But apart from writing the word “Paris” on the menu, there seemed to have been no further thought put into delivering any sort of Parisian experience. Six By Nico is a hangar-sized, terrifically noisy bun fight in what feels a bit like a neglected All Bar One, with the occasional haphazard attempts at small-plates fine dining being thrust on your table without fanfare. On top of that, the area around the table we were placed at smelled distinctly unpleasant, the downstairs bathrooms reminded me of those in a 2am nightclub, as did the noise levels in the place as a whole. It’s easy to work out why diners are attracted here, because this is fine dining at Pizza Express prices for a generation raised on nonstop MasterChef and other television cookery shows. Why anyone would return a second time is less obvious. The smell and the shouting aside, the “Paris” menu ranged from quite decent to posh aeroplane food, and with small portions, so at least you could be done and get back out into the fresh air mercifully sharpish. First up, caramelised French onion with a comté foam, then a meaningful glimpse of beef tartare with cured egg yolk, leading on to a squirrel’s bellyful of chestnut velouté with celeriac. All three of these courses shoved together would not have covered a child’s plate. Hake with coco beans and saffron rouille was overcooked and the sauce gelatinous, while the breast of duck was minute, but at least prettily plated on a truffle and puy lentil fricassée with a parsley root puree. Pudding was baked savarin on some pear. Even so, every single table was full, and a queue of wannabe diners trailed out of the door, eager to throw money in Nico’s general direction. For me, mystified is not quite the word. My coat, when I put it back on, drunk on the prospect of freedom, had a wet arm where it had been trailing off the back of my chair. “Please tell me it’s water,” I said to Charles as we walked to the tube sad and hungry. “It could be wine,” he said helpfully, “but I’m not sure – it’s quite, er, smelly.” I didn’t ask any more questions. I had experienced the new, relaxed, groovy, rule-free, careless face of fine dining, and my main feeling is do it properly, or don’t bother.

12/10/2021,"A determined reader can, it is said, power through Tolstoy’s mammoth tale of love and war in a week. But the audio version cannot be easily hurried, as narrators go at their own pace; that is, if you don’t cheat and crank up the speed. Clocking in at more than 60 hours in length, this rerecorded, unabridged version is not for the faint-hearted, but those able to put in the time will be rewarded.  War and Peace opens in St Petersburg in 1805 where there is handwringing in upper-class drawing rooms over the advance of Bonaparte. The narrator Thandiwe Newton rises to the challenge of voicing the scores of aristocrats who gossip and meddle in each other’s lives while bemoaning the state of Europe. Among the main players are Pierre Bezukhov, the illegitimate son of a count who wants a slice of his father’s riches; Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, who goes off to fight in the war; and Natasha, the beautiful daughter of a nobleman, with whom both men are enamoured. The book has its challenges, some of which even Newton, with her impressive range of voices, cannot overcome. New characters arrive thick and fast, many of them related to one another, and it can be hard to keep on top of them without the help of a whiteboard and pen. The unhappily married Pierre’s excursions into freemasonry also test the patience. But the battles and bear hunts are exciting and there is the singular satisfaction of having got to the end and conquered this most intimidating classic.

12/10/2021,"Florida wildlife officials will undertake a manatee feeding and rescue operation involving hand-feeding the mammals romaine lettuce, amid unprecedented mortality among the gentle aquatic creatures affectionately known as “sea cows”. Typically, manatees return to warm water winter feeding grounds, where they feast on plentiful seagrass.  But algal blooms from polluted waters have devastated seagrass beds, and thereby wiped out the important food source for the manatees. Algal blooms and manatee deaths have been especially pronounced along Florida’s Atlantic coast, leading to record-breaking mortality. “Our agencies and Unified Command partners carefully considered all aspects of a short-term feeding trial,” said Shannon Estenoz, assistant secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks with the federal Department of Interior, in a release. “It is critical we help manatees in the short term with actions that are compatible with their long-term wellbeing and resilience.” Normally slow-moving and plump, manatees along Florida’s east coast have shown signs of starvation, and appeared emaciated with protruding ribs. Manatee deaths have overwhelmed local rescue groups and even the ecosystem. Hundreds of manatee carcasses have had to be towed to remote islands, where they have been left to rot, the Palm Beach Post reported. “They are starving, and I see it in person,” Paul Fafeita, president of the Clean Water Coalition of Indian River county, told local television station CBS12 in Palm Beach. “I’m out there all the time. I’m witnessing it. It’s heart wrenching.” As a result, Florida and federal government wildlife officials said they would begin an operation to hand-feed manatees romaine lettuce, among other efforts. A temporary field response station is also expected to be set up in the Indian River Lagoon, on the coast near Orlando, where many deaths have occurred. The Florida state legislature increased an annual stipend for manatee rescue to $8m. Initial 2021 manatee mortality data from the state’s conservation department showed more than 1,000 manatees have died. Manatees are an endangered species. The most recent aerial survey of Florida manatee populations found only about 5,700 in Florida, according to Save the Manatee. In the last five years, an average of 500 manatees have died. By comparison in 2001, just 325 manatees were found dead, with boats among their biggest killers.",News/Environment,Florida will begin emergency feeding and rescue of starving manatees ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/10/florida-manatees-rescue-emergency-feeding
12/10/2021,"Perhaps it has had its time, but a staple of cricket commentary used to be nominating which player you would like to bat for your life. For those of my vintage, it was always Steve Waugh. Chewing gum, trudging, plonking his bundle of baggy green rags on his head, Waugh would rake his flat stare over a pitch and an opposing team like he’d literally rather die than give them his wicket. He kept his average above 50 by sheer force of will. He came across as the ultimate obdurate bastard, the man who broke Jason Gillespie’s leg with his own face. If you were playing the Bat For Your Life sweepstakes, a player you would be terrified to draw would be Travis Head. One-way ticket out of the Hunger Games for you. If Waugh epitomised obduracy, Head has epitomised looseness, constantly fiddling around off stump like a teenager who has just discovered the habit. He has hopped and chopped and prodded. Even his strike rotation to length balls uses an angled bat, risk where none is needed. He might not be the only player caught twice in a Test match off a top edge at deep third man, but they could probably take one carriage on the Ferris wheel.  That has never meant, curiously, that Head has strings of total failures. He goes after the ball immediately, and so he starts to score. He has a good enough eye that he gets some shots away. So even when his looseness has seen him undone, he has almost always had some runs to his name before that happens. Only twice in his 32 innings – including his first – has he been out for nought. Only three other times has he been out in single figures. Most players make these sort of scores between a quarter and a third of the time. Head has passed 20, 30, 50, even on the days when he hasn’t gone big. The upshot of this is that he has been more influential at times than his numbers suggest. He has been half of a number of important partnerships for Australia in matches when things weren’t going well. He has broken up stagnating innings, assisted teammates in getting moving. He has left matches changed, without leaving scorecards crowded. He has played second fiddle where required, without ever becoming too sotto voce. In this first Ashes Test in Brisbane, he had the chance for a dramatic solo. This time, he held the stage for the entire performance. He played his innings exactly as you would expect. He didn’t put away a single shot for the duration. And it kept working. Every time his tally of balls faced got close to his runs scored, he kicked away again. It wasn’t that this was an entirely streaky innings. There were slices and edges, and they were interspersed with sound clouts down the ground for six. Airborne drives either side of grounded ones. It was more that Head chose the positive option, the aggressive option, every time it was a possibility, and was willing to take chances. In part, he was lucky. In part he made that luck. By the time his century arrived on the second evening, it came from 85 balls. Of Australians, only Adam Gilchrist, David Warner, Jack Gregory and Matthew Hayden have managed to do so in fewer. His was the third-fastest Ashes century of all time. Head resumed on 112 on the third morning with the bottom three in the Australian order for company. He carried on, thumping Ben Stokes for a straight six from the bowler’s second ball. He swept Jack Leach for yet another four. His audacious flick for six from the express pace of Mark Wood, walking across the line of the ball, was all the more entertaining given Head had just missed an identical attempt and nearly lost his stumps. By the time Wood finally did claim his timber, last man out for 154, Head had faced 148 deliveries. A normal Travis Head innings is something like 30 runs from 30-odd deliveries, assembled by not holding back until the final mistake arrives. This century was basically five Travis Head innings stitched together. He had played exactly as he wanted, and he had made it work. At the time, with 425 on the board and a lead of 278, that innings would have felt to his teammates like the climax at the end of their two-day crescendo. Yet by the end of the third day, with that lead whittled all the way down to a slender 58 and only two English wickets taken, they would have been wishing there had been a couple more partnerships, a couple of 30s or 40s from the players who didn’t provide them. That would have taken Australia past 500, on to a different plane of dominance. In short, Travis Head would have been greatly aided by someone playing the role of Travis Head. Instead, one Travis Head had to do.",Sport/Sport,Travis Head plays fast and loose with England but runs out of support | Geoff Lemon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/10/travis-head-plays-fast-and-loose-cricket-england-but-runs-out-of-support
12/10/2021,"It’s the most wonderful time of the year: list season! You have probably already dived headlong into the Guardian’s best TV, music and films of 2021 (although you’ll have to log on next week to find out our top fives for each of those), and everyone from Pitchfork to the Telegraph has followed suit with their own rundowns. And in a couple of weeks time the Guide newsletter will be sharing your cultural highlights of the year. (Thanks to those of you who have already sent yours; for everyone else, do get involved – further info at the bottom of this newsletter.) I love list season, as it offers not only the chance to discover new things, but also to whinge about which of my favourite films, TV shows or albums have been outrageously overlooked by the biased mainstream media. Still, in these strange times, it does seem like some of these lists are missing something: namely all the good stuff that didn’t come out in 2021 but we devoured anyway. As with 2020, this year we had a preposterous amount of time on our hands, a dearth (at least in the first half of the year) of entertainment options beyond our front doors, and a host streaming services crammed full of decades’ worth of films, albums and TV shows at our fingertips. So, with that in mind, I thought I would share some of the best new old culture I encountered this year …  TV While I enjoyed season two of Tim Robinson’s gonzo Netflix sketch show I Think You Should Leave, it slightly lacked some of the spontaneous “Where on Earth did they get that idea from?” magic of its first season – and it wasn’t the best Robinson-related show I binged through in 2021. No, that was Detroiters (available in full on Now), which Guardian writer Stuart Heritage has long raved about, but which I’d only watched in fits and starts until recently. Unlike ITYSL it’s an actual sitcom with plots and everything (it follows the travails of two inept but likable ad execs), but like ITSYL it possesses a sort of dream comedy logic, where the joke almost certainly goes in the opposite direction to the one you expect. And for something completely, drastically, different, can I recommend the 1972 travelogue Nairn Across Britain (available in full on iPlayer), in which late, great writer and critic Ian Nairn travels across the country by A-road, train and barge, delivering some absolutely savage put-downs of the state of British architecture in the process. They don’t make them like this any more. FILM I’ve droned on about my love of The Rewatchables podcast, which analyses older films that merit repeat viewings, enough on here already – but as well as being a great listen in its own right, it has prompted me to catch a few classics that I had inexplicably never seen before. So I burned through David Fincher’s shaggy dog thriller The Game (audacious, preposterous and strangely timely given our surfeit of “deadly game”-themed culture this year); Michael Mann’s tobacco industry drama The Insider (utterly riveting and strangely overlooked in conversations about the best films of the late 90s); and Oliver Stone’s American Football epic Any Given Sunday (steroidal, daft, occasionally brilliant, frequently unintentionally funny). For something a little more this century, check out Les Misérables (Netflix), a lit fuse of a French thriller set in the banlieues that was slightly overlooked when it was released last autumn. It’s La Haine but somehow even more stomach-knottingly tense. MUSIC Earlier this year, the Guardian music desk published a great piece about that strange period in the 90s where seemingly any song that appeared on a Levi’s advert –Spaceman, Flat Beat etc – became a hit. One of the tracks I vaguely remember from that era was A Nanny in Manhattan, a slice of catchy 60s British invasion-style pop from a Washington DC band called Lilys who I had assumed were one-hit wonders. Wrong! It turns out they actually have had a fascinating, varied career, first as a shogazey lo-fi indie band (check out the vaguely Teenage Fanclub-y Ginger), then later as oddball 60s revivalists. Their apex is 1999 album The 3 Way, which sounds like a lost chamber-pop classic with added experimental garage psych and almost math rock-like flourishes. There’s one song on it – the seven-minute epic Socs Hip – that has more ideas on it than most albums.
