2/24/2022,"Watch: Vladimir Putin 'won't just stop at Ukraine', foreign secretary warns Vladimir Putin ""won't just stop at Ukraine"" as the prospect of a ""full-scale"" invasion continues to loom, the foreign secretary has said. Ukraine entered a state of emergency on Wednesday and began to call up military reservists amid fears of war, as Russian tanks and around 200,000 troops sit in readiness on the borders. Russia has started evacuating its diplomatic staff from all of its diplomatic facilities in Ukraine, the TASS news agency reported, citing a representative of Russia's embassy in Kyiv. Putin authorised ""peacekeeping"" soldiers into two breakaway regions in Donetsk and Luhansk on Tuesday, having formally recognised them as independent, in a move that amounts to the beginning of an invasion according to Western leaders. Liz Truss warned Putin could have bigger plans under wraps. She told ITV: ""He’s said he doesn’t believe in the existence of Ukraine, he believes it should be under Russian control and I fear we have to take him at his word, he won’t just stop in Ukraine either. “He has also talked about turning the clock back to the 1990s where Russia had control over vast swathes of eastern Europe.” Moscow denies planning an invasion and has described warnings as anti-Russian hysteria. It has also taken no steps to withdraw the troops deployed along Ukraine's frontiers.

The PM targeted five banks and three individuals who have had their assets frozen and been banned from travelling to the UK. Johnson has been accused of weakness and failing to go far enough with the measures. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer pressed the PM to impose more sanctions, saying: “There has already been an invasion. There is clearly concern across the House that his strategy, I accept unintentionally, could send the wrong message."" Johnson insisted the UK was poised to go further, insisting that “any Russian entity, any Russian individual” and members of the Russian parliament could now be targeted by UK sanctions if needed.

Watch: Tanks and armoured personnel carriers near Donetsk On Tuesday, the Russian parliament gave the green light for Putin to deploy troops abroad, further fuelling fears that a full invasion is imminent. Around 200,000 Russia troops are now stationed along the Ukrainian border, sparking fears that a full assault on the capital of Kyiv could be part of Russia's plan. Diplomacy attempts have been made in an effort to diffuse the situations, but summits have become increasingly fraught between Putin and the West. Watch: Boris Johnson unleashes sanctions on Russia Boris Johnson has unveiled a “first barrage” of economic sanctions against Russia. It comes in response to President Putin sending troops into Donetsk and Luhansk after he officially recognised the breakaway Ukrainian regions as independent states. The US ambassador to the United Nations has said it is still not too late for a diplomatic solution. Linda Thomas-Greenfield said that war could be averted if Moscow ceased its aggression towards it neighbour and returned to the negotiating table. “As you heard President Biden say yesterday, we have not given up on diplomacy,” Thomas-Greenfield told an online briefing. “The Russians can cease their current actions and come back to the negotiating table and find a way forward that is not going to lead to this devastating conflict that will lead to the loss of thousands more lives in Ukraine.” Her comments came after the White House announced earlier this week that it was scrapping plans for a possible summit between President Biden and President Putin following Russia’s recognition of the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk.",News/Yahoo News UK,‘He won’t stop at Ukraine’: Warnings Putin could go further amid warnings of full-scale invasion,https://news.yahoo.com/we-will-inflict-even-more-pain-on-russia-truss-amid-calls-further-sanctions-083149373.html

2/24/2022,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday questioned whether Ukraine had a right to sovereignty because he said the government in Kyiv did not represent the country's constituent parts, the Interfax news agency reported. ""If we talk about the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity, one of the key documents ... is the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations among Peoples,"" he was quoted as saying. He accused Ukraine of being out of line with that since 2014 when a Moscow-backed president was overthrown in Kyiv and replaced by a pro-Western leader, prompting Russia to annex Ukraine's peninsula of Crimea and back an insurgency in its eastern regions. ""I don't think anyone can claim that the Ukrainian regime, since the 2014 coup d'état, represents all the people living on the territory of the Ukrainian state,"" Lavrov was quoted as saying.

2/24/2022,"The West has accused Vladimir Putin of launching an invasion of Ukraine after the Russian president ordered soldiers into two breakaway regions. Putin claimed his troops were on a ""peacekeeping"" mission and that he recognised the Donetsk and Luhansk areas in eastern Ukraine as independent. But Western countries said the move was an attempt to create a pretext for a further invasion, warning it could be the biggest war in Europe since 1945. It comes after weeks of increasing tension that has pitted Russia against Nato allies, including the US and UK, who have repeatedly told Putin to back down. The escalation has put renewed focus on the 73-year-old transatlantic military alliance, which in recent years has struggled to maintain the same level of relevancy that it had in the latter decades of the 20th century. As recently as 2019, it was a fractured organisation with French president Emmanuel Macron bemoaning its ""brain death"" in the light of a Trump-led US focus on budgets rather than geo-political importance. Yahoo News UK explains what Nato is, why Putin regards it as a foe, and outlines the unique defensive pact that binds its members together. Watch: Russia approves use of armed forces as NATO warns of 'full-scale attack' Russian legislators have given President Vladimir Putin permission to use armed forces abroad.  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a political and military alliance of 30 countries. Nato was set up in 1949 to protect members against the Soviet Union, with 12 nations initially signing up to the North Atlantic Treaty in Washington DC. These countries were the US, Canada, the UK, Belgium, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Portugal. Read more:

Ministry of Defence posts map of how Putin could invade Ukraine on Twitter Nato's political objectives are to ""promote democratic values"", ""enable members to consult and cooperate on defence and security-related issues"", and to ""prevent conflict"". The organisation said it ""is committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes"", but if diplomacy fails it will use its military power ""to undertake crisis-management operations"". Nato has four multinational battalion-size battlegroups, or some 4,000 soldiers, led by Canada, Germany, the UK and the US in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Poland. The troops serve as a ""tripwire"" for Nato's 40,000-strong response force to come in quickly and bring more US troops and weapons from across the Atlantic. 1949: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the UK, the US. 1952: Greece, Turkey 1955: Germany 1982: Spain 1999: Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland 2004: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia 2009: Albania, Croatia 2017: Montenegro 2020: North Macedonia Since the Cold War ended, Nato has expanded eastwards by taking in 14 new countries, including the states of the former Warsaw Pact and the three Baltic nations that were once in the Soviet Union. Russia sees this as a threatening encroachment towards its borders and continues to say it was a betrayal of Western promises at the start of the 1990s – something Nato denies. Ukraine is not a Nato member but has a promise dating from 2008 that it will eventually get to join. Since toppling a pro-Russian president in 2014, Ukraine has become closer politically to the West, staged joint military exercises with Nato and taken delivery of weapons. Kyiv and Washington saw these as legitimate moves to bolster Ukraine's defence after Russia seized the Crimea region in 2014 and provided backing to separatists in eastern Ukraine. Putin believes Ukraine's growing ties with the alliance could make it a launchpad for Nato missiles targeted at Russia. He said Russia needs to lay down ""red lines"" to prevent that. In an address on Monday, Putin said: ""In Nato documents, our country is officially and directly declared the main threat to North Atlantic security. And Ukraine will serve as a forward springboard for the strike."" But his demands that Ukraine drop its long-term goal of joining the Atlantic military alliance have been repeatedly rebuffed by Kyiv and Nato states. The collective defence clause of Nato's founding treaty – Article 5 of the Washington Treaty – is a provision that means an attack against one member is considered an attack against all of them. This is a fundamental part of Nato and why it says it is a defensive alliance. Nato says military operations are carried out under Article 5 or a United Nations mandate, alone or in co-operation with other countries and international organisations. Ukraine is not a member of Nato and the alliance is not treaty-bound to defend it. US president Joe Biden has said he will not send American or allied troops to fight Russia in Ukraine. However, Kyiv is a close partner and was promised eventual membership of the alliance.
