12/19/2021,"(Bloomberg) -- The S&P 500 Index is poised to end higher for the third year in a row, having added more than 20% so far in 2021. Another rally in 2022 would make for a four-year winning streak, which has happened only five times in nearly a century.

The longest-ever wining streak was the eight-year period from 1982 to 1989 (even with a dramatic crash in October 1987, the S&P 500 still eked out a gain). A substantial one-year jump is fairly common, with the index adding 20% or more during a calendar year 25 times, or about once every four years. Most strategists expect the index will finish 2022 higher, with the average forecast level at 4,950 (versus a close of 4,669 on Thursday), with the lowest forecast at 4,400 and the highest at 5,330. The latter is from Oppenheimer Asset Management’s chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus, Wall Street’s biggest equity bull at the moment.

12/19/2021,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. and online health-care company Teladoc Inc. defied a market slump to rally on Friday, helping give a brief respite to Cathie Wood’s battered funds.

The fund is still down more than 20% this year with only Tesla and Intellia Therapeutics Inc. among those 10 that are on track to end 2021 higher. It’s been a bitter year, pitting retail traders against short-selling hedge funds with losses on both sides. While many day-trading favorites have fallen below their former highs and shorts are once again amassing bearish bets, a JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic pointed to day traders’ resilience and said he expects a year-end rally to be driven by the stocks targeted by short sellers. His forecast felt particularly prescient on an otherwise downbeat trading day Friday as the funds run by Wood, a market guru for the masses who has made big bets in the future of some unprofitable companies, advanced. Bearish institutional investors have Tesla, ARKK’s No. 1 holding, in their targets with one of the markets most eye-popping short positions. The electric vehicle-maker has more than $25 billion in shares sold short, according to S3 Partners. Bets against Teladoc are over $2 billion and almost all the top holdings in the ARKK fund have sizeable short positions in the $1 billion range. “For short-selling campaigns to succeed, there have to be positioning, liquidity and often systematic amplifiers of the selloff,” Kolanovic wrote. “We believe these conditions are not met, and hence this market episode may end up in a short squeeze and cyclical rally into year-end and January.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek A Fight to Die How McDonald’s Made Enemies of Black Franchisees How to Have a Perfect Work-From-Home Friday A Wild, Emotional Year Has Changed Investing—Maybe Forever Tesla Takes Customers to Court to Silence Its Critics in China ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•2 days ago,Ark Picks Advance While JPMorgan Predicts ‘Short Squeeze Rally’,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ark-picks-advance-while-jpmorgan-205404568.html
