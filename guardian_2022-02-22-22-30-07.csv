2/22/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s angry and rambling hour-long potted history of Ukraine’s failings on Monday night, culminating in a commitment to recognise the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk, left western diplomats scratching their heads and wondering whether they had been made redundant. The Russian president not only said he would recognise Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine, rendering eight years of negotiations over their futurepointless, but he also signalled that Russia could not tolerate an independent Ukraine on its borders. Nato was hardly mentioned. His target at one point seemed to be the Bolsheviks, for relinquishing land to the nationalists.  The lecture was a far cry from a statement from Emmanuel Macron’s office 24 hours earlier saying the French and Russian leaders had “made firm commitments to carry out all useful actions to avoid escalation, reduce risks and preserve peace.” Putin said the self-declared republics needed defending from the threat of “genocide”, and parts of Ukraine must be purged of corruption, cells of extremists and the threat of nuclear weapons being pointed “only in a matter of time” at Moscow. “Ukraine is an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space,” Putin said. “These are our comrades, those dearest to us – not only colleagues, friends and people who once served together, but also relatives, people bound by blood, by family ties.” Much of what was said was a rehash of an article he wrote last summer, but it has become clear this ideology is now guiding his actions and that he needs to be taken literally and seriously. Following the logic of Putin’s speech, it seems only a matter of time before a full invasion of Ukraine to reunite the two peoples will have to take place. Russia, viewed through this lens, cannot face the risk of assault from Ukrainian territory. The “puppet regime” will have to be removed. Yet even now, at this grimmest point, the west does not want to take the final step of breaking off all diplomatic contact with the Kremlin. Diplomats are looking desperately for chinks of light in the gloom. One uncertainty is quite how far the “Russian peacekeepers” will advance. Will Putin recognise all of Luhansk and Donetsk as independent, or just the territory currently held by the Russia-backed separatists? The former would mean pushing his tanks across the line of contact, drastically increasing the possibility of full-blown conflict. The latter is still a breach of international law, and rips up the Minsk accords, but in a way only formalises the existing Russian presence in the area. This uncertainty accounts for why the west is not yet unleashing the full big bazooka of sanctions. There will be coordinated sanctions in Brussels, London and Washington. They will go after entities and people in the self-proclaimed republics, as well as those close to the Putin regime. But the package is unlikely yet to constitute an imposition of export controls and the drying up of finance for Russia in the London capital markets. The discrepancy constitutes a change of tactics if not strategy. At a briefing on 25 January, state department officials insisted: “The gradualism of the past is out, and this time we’ll start at the top of the escalation ladder and stay there. We’ve made efforts to signal this intention very clearly”. Boris Johnson said in Kyiv last week that as soon as a Russian toecap crossed into Ukraine, sanctions would be triggered. But Putin has not quite gone over the brink, hence the caution. A US intelligence official a week ago had likened the west’s tactics in handling Putin to dealing with a kidnapper holding hostages in a booby-trapped building. The first aim was to keep the kidnapper talking. The hope was that a professional negotiator, or a sympathetic family member, perhaps a member of the Russian army, could talk the highly strung kidnapper round and make him realise that whatever his grievances, this is not going to work out well for him in the long term. Even now, Putin is toying with the matches but not yet blown the whole building up. If anything he has now lost some leverage by taking the pressure off Ukraine to offer concessions and leaving his protector China uneasy at the UN security council. He also weakened the advocates of diplomacy in Europe. Macron will defend his efforts to keep Putin talking, even if it is seen as a heroic failure. But his proposed summit on the future security architecture of Europe – still not rejected by the Kremlin – looks doomed. Putin simply cannot be trusted. That leaves the west focusing on the consequences of a breakdown – sanctions, shoring up Nato’s eastern flank, preparing for refugees and finding ways to help the Ukrainian army to make Putin’s price of victory so high that his domestic popularity nosedives along with the rouble.",News/World news,Putin’s rambling Ukraine speech leaves western diplomats scrambling,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/putin-russian-president-ukraine-speech-western-diplomats-scrambling
2/22/2022,"Jack Smethurst, who has died aged 89, achieved national fame in Love Thy Neighbour, a television sitcom that ran for a phenomenally successful eight series during the 1970s – but was looked back on as racist and, even for its time, anachronistic. He starred as Eddie Booth, the white, Labour-voting, union-supporting factory worker outraged when Bill Reynolds (played by Rudolph Walker), a Conservative-voting black man, not only gets a job in his workplace but also moves in next door to him. The programme’s creators, Vince Powell and Harry Driver, insisted accusations of bigotry were unwarranted because Bill’s views were presented as ignorance and there was prejudice on both sides. Smethurst also said he took the role on the assurance that Eddie would be seen as the one in the wrong.  Meanwhile, the pair’s wives, Joan Booth (Kate Williams) and Barbie Reynolds (Nina Baden-Semper), got along swimmingly and such was the sitcom’s popularity, with viewing figures sometimes exceeding 20 million over a five-year run (1972-76), that it spawned a 1973 film and a 1975 stage tour. The on-screen, off-screen demarcations were seemingly spelled out when Smethurst and Walker played themselves, laughing and joking as they share a drink together at a TV studio, in the 1974 film Man About the House. Despite the criticisms, Love Thy Neighbour was screened around the world and a new version was made for Australian television in 1979, with just Smethurst going with it in a story line that finds Eddie settling in Australia, treated as the “foreigner” and facing conflict. Other television offers went quiet for a while and Smethurst briefly found a job in a flower shop. He later blamed typecasting. “I don’t think it was the racial content,” he said in a 2016 BBC Radio 4 documentary, Still Loving Thy Neighbour? “I think it’s the fact that your face is so familiar. I think people are a lot more adaptable now.” Smethurst was born in the Collyhurst area of Manchester, the third of five children of Kitty (nee Brown), a department store worker, and Bill Smethurst, a packer in a factory. After the family’s home was destroyed by German bombs during the second world war, Jack was evacuated to Blackpool and the family eventually moved to Blackley, Manchester. From an early age, rather than using his given name, John, he was known as Jack, after his maternal uncle, Jackie Brown, a boxing champion. On leaving St Clare’s school, Blackley, at the age of 14 with no qualifications, Jack delivered groceries, then had a job as an apprentice cutter in a raincoat factory and did seasonal agricultural work in Lincolnshire. During national service with the RAF as a corporal in the cookhouse at Cosford, Shropshire, he spent leave time watching plays at Birmingham repertory theatre. It reinforced in him the desire to perform he had felt after seeing the Carl Rosa opera company at Manchester Opera House in his teens. The RAF and Manchester city council then jointly funded him through drama school training, at the London Academy of Dramatic Arts (1954-56). While in Hornchurch for his first repertory theatre work, Smethurst was heard on BBC radio with the Queen’s Players company, under the director Stuart Burge, in a 1956 production of the George Farquhar play The Recruiting Officer, with Smethurst playing the police constable. He was in at the beginning of the revolution giving a voice to the working classes when he played a collier in Serjeant Musgrave’s Dance, John Arden’s drama about army deserters, at the Royal Court theatre (1959). Then came bit parts in the social-realist “kitchen sink” films Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960) and A Kind of Loving (1962). Smethurst followed those with character roles in television plays and popular series, including multiple parts in the police dramas No Hiding Place (five, from 1961 to 1965) and Z Cars (seven, 1962 to 1969). Although he appeared as an army recruit in the film Carry on Sergeant (1958), he was in few TV comedies until the end of the 1960s. He was a regular in the sitcom For the Love of Ada (1970-71) as Leslie Pollitt, son-in-law and neighbour of a widow (Irene Handl) enjoying a relationship with the gravedigger (Wilfred Pickles) who buried her husband. Smethurst also appeared in the 1972 spin-off film. Either side of Love Thy Neighbour, Smethurst had four roles in Coronation Street: Fred Clark, a crooked brewery worker delivering short orders (1961); Percy Bridge, accepting money from Elsie Tanner after he falsely claimed to have saved her grandson’s life (1967); Johnny Webb, Eddie Yeats’s fellow refuse collector who briefly lodged at the Ogdens’ (1980 and 1983); and Stan Wagstaff, an allotment holder alongside Jack Duckworth (2001). Returning to sitcom, Smethurst played the boss of a TV chat-show researcher (Marti Caine) in Hilary (1984-86) and had a cameo in Last of the Summer Wine as Davenport, a lost guidebook writer (1997). Powell also wrote the BBC Radio 2 sitcom A Proper Charlie (1984-85) for Smethurst. He starred as Charlie Garside, a trade unionist who works in a factory but spends most of his time in the pub. In 1957, Smethurst married Julie Nicholls, an actor. She and their four children, Perdita, Merry, Jane and Adam, an actor, survive him.

2/22/2022,"Welcome to Pushing Buttons, the Guardian’s gaming newsletter. If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email.  Welcome back to Pushing Buttons! Apologies for the late arrival of today’s newsletter; I was unexpectedly stranded with my family for several days last week because of Storm Eunice. Naturally this was the one time in the past five years that I have travelled without a Nintendo Switch, so I couldn’t even turn this into an opportunity to introduce my five-year-old to Mario Kart, a parenting moment I have been looking forward to since he was born. Sadly the last couple of times I’ve tried to introduce him to games have not gone well. The cute Mario Bros Game and Watch that Nintendo released a while back was thrown across the room in a rage after about 90 seconds (“I HATE JUMPING!!!”), and he disliked Pokémon: Let’s Go Pikachu so much that it will no for ever be known in our house as No No Pikachu. Speaking of Nintendo, it was announced last week that the company is finally shutting the virtual storefronts on its older consoles, 2012’s Wii U and 2011’s 3DS, later this year. Why does this matter? Well – aside from the relatively small number of people who might still want to buy and download games for these consoles, there are plenty of other people who are concerned that many of the 1800-odd games on these digital stores are not available to buy anywhere else. Some of them were made specifically for the consoles in question and never made available on discs or cartridges; others are classic Nintendo games, such as the Zelda: Oracle of Ages/Seasons spin-offs, which are otherwise difficult to get ahold of in their original Game Boy Color forms. There’s still time to download anything you might want from these old digital storefronts before they close for good, sometime after August. But this points towards a problem that is particularly pronounced in this art form: preservation. If you want to legally play, say, a SNES game from 1993, you have to own the original console and an original cartridge, which can be troublesome enough to track down. But games that were only ever released digitally can simply vanish if the company that made or hosted them goes bust, or decides to stop supporting them. This is particularly pronounced on Apple and Google’s smartphone storefronts: games appear and disappear all the time. Most of us have hazy memories of games on old computers or early consoles that seem to have been lost to time. Imagine what that’ll be like for the kids who grew up playing games on an iPad. This matters because large swathes of video game history are in permanent danger of being erased. Organisations like the Video Game History Museum go to huge lengths to track down and preserve copies of games, or in-progress code, or artwork and development materials, but the job is enormous, and few of gaming’s big players seem to care that much about the medium’s history. Companies get acquired and their back catalogues get thrown away. I’m still salty about Bookworm Adventure, a fantastic 2007 adventure-scrabble game that EA inexplicably scrubbed from existence after it bought its developer, PopCap. Inevitably, when there is literally no other way to experience older games, people turn to questionably-legal or straight-up illegal emulation. Copyright laws mean that digitally preserving games in this way is at best extremely complicated – but when companies won’t make the effort to preserve their own history, what are game archivists (or curious retro game fans) supposed to do? At least Nintendo reliably rereleases its classics on its newer consoles every few years. We have to pay for them again every time, though. I’ve lost count of the number of times I must have bought the original Super Mario Bros on all the different Nintendo consoles I’ve owned since 1995 – though I’m comforted by the fact that I’ve definitely spent nowhere near much as the guy who paid $2m for a sealed copy at auction. Full disclosure: I have not played the finished version of Elden Ring, a dark-fantasy collaboration between Dark Souls’ creators at FromSoftware in Japan, and George RR Martin. But I played an in-progress beta version at the tail end of last year, and that was enough to convince me that this game will be a highlight of my year. It’s challenging, unsurprisingly – this studio is well known for its uncompromising approach to game design – but also so intriguing, a crumbling fantasy realm full of brutal creatures to fight and dark secrets to uncover at the ends of overgrown paths. Think Dark Souls meets Zelda: Breath of the Wild and you’re halfway there. It’s out this week, and the reviews will start arriving tomorrow. Available on: PC, Xbox One/Series S/Series X, PlayStation 4/5Approximate playtime: 40+ hours I have always been rather baffled by Gran Turismo, the rather sterile-looking and fastidiously detailed racing game that has been a PlayStation staple since the 90s. So I was enormously charmed to read Mike Channel’s explanation of how eccentric and appealing it is to its fans. GT is “a surprisingly personal, constantly evolving interrogation of the relationship between humans and the metal boxes they careen around in”, he says, a reflection of the mercurial interests of its intriguing creative director Kazunori Yamauchi – who, I learned from this article, is himself an accomplished racing driver who has participated many times in the Nurburgring 24 Hours endurance race. Some Wordle fans are starting to lose faith, suspecting that its new owner the New York Times has made unwelcome changes. I guess all things must pass, but has Wordle’s time really come already? The BBC has investigated the existence of sex games and chatrooms on mega-popular online children’s game Roblox, built by determined rule-breakers. It is of course a law of the internet that people will attempt to make porn out of anything – fellow millennials might remember what went on in the dark corners of similarly sexless 00s chat game Habbo Hotel. Nonetheless, parents should be advised that this stuff does exist on the platform, and that it is extremely difficult to police. ‘The sprites clearly do not look like actual lemmings’: the inside story of an iconic video game The 15 best games on Apple Arcade Total War: Warhammer III review – swords, sorcery and symphonic metal To balance out the enormous open-world games I’ve been recommending for the past couple of weeks, I thought I’d answer this question from reader Lawal Muhammad (hello again!): Given the oft interrupted life of a gamer-parent, which games would you recommend for the time-poor and sleep-deprived? My memories of the first six months or so with each of my babies have been mostly erased by sleep deprivation, but I do remember that video games got me through a lot of long nights. At that stage I could not cope with ANY stress whatsoever, though, so I stuck to games that exerted absolutely no pressure on me. I played about 60 hours of pleasant farming game Stardew Valley in the middle of the night, because its soothing, predictable daily rhythms were a salve for my tired brain, and absolutely nothing stressful or tragic could possibly happen. I played Breath of the Wild, because it was easy to achieve and save little milestones during a 20-minute baby nap. I played Forza Horizon, because it was the closest thing I could get to a holiday. I played a lot on my phone, especially games that could be finished quickly and would be different every time I played them: sci-fi story-generator Faster than Light, the beautiful interactive novella 80 Days.",Arts/Games,Pushing Buttons: why swathes of classic games are at risk of being lost forever,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/22/pushing-buttons-retro-games-nintendo
2/22/2022,"The director of public prosecutions for England and Wales has been severely criticised by Vera Baird, the victims’ commissioner, for failing to take responsibility for a record-breaking low in rape convictions. Max Hill, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, was accused by Baird of overseeing a “catastrophic” period in the organisation’s history. She also claimed there were half as many rapists off the streets since he took charge.  Her comments followed Hill’s interview on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, when he claimed he was trying to restore lost public confidence over rape cases by changes that include saving cases from being written off by police. ONS figures last month revealed there were 63,136 rape offences in the year to September 2021, while prosecutions were 1.3%. Appearing on the same programme, Baird was asked which organisation should accept the blame for the poor rape conviction rates. She said: “It is the CPS’s fault, almost completely. And I could hear Justin [Webb, the presenter] interviewing Max Hill expecting him to accept some blame, but he didn’t. “Every year since 2010, the CPS prosecuted 3,900-ish cases. Every year since he’s arrived they’ve prosecuted less than 2,000. Convictions were always over 2,200, they got almost to 3,000 – since he arrived, they’ve never been more than 1,500. “I think Max Hill has presided as DPP over the most catastrophic period in the CPS’s history for prosecuting rape,” she said. Baird also claimed Hill had appeared on the programme because he was pre-empting a report by Her Majesty’s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate into rape convictions that is expected to be released on Friday. “They are expecting an inspection report on Friday and it seems to me they are trying to pre-empt it because it is likely to be poor. “Certainly the last one said that there was a lack of awareness in the CPS on trauma. They said they approached cases with a view to focus on the weaknesses rather than the strengths. “An increased conviction rate of 60% is not much use if you are prosecuting very few cases. There are half the number of rapists off the streets than there were before Max Hill became DPP,” she said. Hill, who took over as DPP from Alison Saunders in 2018, said earlier on the same programme that he was “deeply frustrated” that so many women who suffer sexual violence, feel a lack of confidence in the entire criminal justice system. “What they are finding over the last year is that by sitting down with police officers at a much earlier stage they can take an investigation that might look as though it is not capable of prosecution, have a conversation about it and convert it into a case that is in court now,” he said. He said that ‘far too few” rape cases were reaching the CPS because of decisions made by the police. “Far too few of the complaints of rape are ever reaching the attention of the CPS. That is where early advice comes in, case progression clinics come in. When the police decide at the conclusion of an investigation that they can’t take any further, we have set up scrutiny panels where we will say ‘bring us a selection of those cases’. “In some, we are able to say ‘have you thought about another angle on the evidence?’” he said. The CPS has published an update on its handling of rape and serious sexual offences that also highlights plans to recruit more specialist rape prosecutors and improve victim support.

2/22/2022,"Putin has recognised the independence of two Russian-controlled territories in east Ukraine. They call themselves the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics. The territories have been armed, financed and politically controlled by Russia since 2014. But until this week, Russia still recognised them as part of Ukraine.  Putin has also sent his military on a “peacekeeping mission” to Ukraine, meaning that Russia will formally occupy sovereign Ukrainian territory for a second time following the 2014 annexation of Crimea. But in this case, Russia has not annexed the territories. A document signed by Putin on Monday also allows him to establish military bases or place missiles in the territories. First, Putin has indicated that he questions Ukraine’s right to statehood, calling modern Ukraine an artificial construct of the Soviet Union. He also sees Russians and Ukrainians as “one people”. Second, he thinks that a western-leaning Ukraine is dangerous for Russia. He has called the possibility of Nato membership for Ukraine a “red line” for the Kremlin. Third, he wants to show that popular revolutions such as the one that took place in Kyiv in 2014 do not succeed in the long run. That helps to prop up his own rule in Russia. The decision marks the end of the Minsk peace deal, a troubled road map out of the conflict that would have left the territories in Ukraine. That deal also contained a ceasefire agreement, which is now also void. More than 14,000 people have died in the fighting that has occurred since 2014. Russia’s military is likely to make a formal entrance into the territories soon. Its troops and military vehicles have secretly taken part in the fighting since 2014, but this deployment will probably be much larger. Moscow will now threaten Ukraine with a broader war if it continues to fight against the “separatists”, telling Kyiv that Russia is now obliged by treaty to defend them from attack. Russia could also justify a further invasion of Ukraine by recognising the territorial claims of the two separatist governments. They include the large city of Mariupol, which is on the other side of the frontlines. If Russia recognises their expanded borders, it may order its troops to begin an offensive against the Ukrainian army. That could be a prelude to a broader conflict. Russia has gathered up to 190,000 troops along the Ukrainian border and is positioned to launch an attack that could threaten the capital, Kyiv, and sweep across much of the country. An offensive of that size has not been seen in Europe since the second world war. Western countries have condemned the threat and are likely to impose sanctions on Moscow this week. But the severity of the punishment will be up for debate. And they have made clear that they will not send combat troops to Ukraine. The US had promised the “mother of all sanctions”, probably targeting Russia’s banking and financial sectors, if Russia invaded Ukraine. But that imagined a blitzkrieg-style ground campaign that could take big cities like Kyiv and Kharkiv. The recognition of the territories and occupation by Russian forces is also an act of aggression but it is not the nightmare scenario. As diplomats met in Brussels on Tuesday, it remained unclear whether Putin’s order to send troops into Ukraine would be the trigger for the massive sanctions the EU has been threatening for weeks. On Tuesday, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy giant Gazprom has been built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Europe’s most divisive energy project, Nord Stream 2 bypasses the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It has faced resistance within the European Union, and from the United States as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increases Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denies Ukraine transit fees and makes it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,Is Russia invading Ukraine and what will happen next?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/is-russia-invading-ukraine-what-next
2/22/2022,"A row has erupted in cabinet over plans to scrap a ban on the import and sale of fur and foie gras after No 10 was convinced to kill off policies that would outlaw the trade. Lord Goldsmith, the environment minister and the ban’s main proponent, spoke out after his colleagues, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, persuaded the prime minister to ditch the proposals.  In response to those in cabinet who do not agree with the ban, Goldsmith said: “The public are strongly in favour of measures to curb the fur trade and foie gras. “There are some who view the issue as a matter of personal choice, but no one would extend that principle to things like dog-fighting or bear-baiting, so it’s not clear why fur farming or force-feeding geese, which arguably are associated with far greater levels of cruelty, should be any different.” There is hope among ministers who are in favour of the bill that it is not yet completely off the table, though sources say “that is the direction of travel”. The ban was supposed to be part of a raft of measures that would position post-Brexit Britain as a world leader on animal welfare. Sources in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the ban had been removed from the animals abroad bill in an attempt to scrap the policy altogether. The production of fur and foie gras products are banned in the UK. The Guardian understands that Rees-Mogg made the intervention as he does not believe banning things to be Conservative in nature. This is a further sign of the struggle for Boris Johnson’s ear being played out by the more libertarian side of the Tory party and the more ecologically minded. Some on the rightof the party believe such bans are against free-trade principles, and that the purchase of such goods should be a matter of choice. Others believe the ban could win over swing voters and show the Conservative party is modern and caring. However, there are even splits on the matter within the European Research Group, often thought of as the hub for the party’s libertarian right wing. A leading member said: “I have made no representations to Boris on this matter. I personally stopped eating foie gras when I learned how it was made.” Yesterday, a number of Conservative MPs said they would demand an explanation from the prime minister, who has previously vowed to use Brexit as an opportunity to take a stand on animal welfare. The ban was mentioned in the government’s action plan for animal welfare and aimed to bring swing voters on side. The 2019 manifesto, which referred to the action plan, also committed to not compromising on animal welfare standards in international trade. A Defra spokesperson said the government was still “fully committed to animal welfare”. The shock decision to remove the ban from the animals abroad bill is likely to upset the prime minister’s wife, Carrie Johnson, who has been vocally supportive of such measures. She has previously: “Anyone who wants to buy fur really is sick. Fur belongs on animals only. Nuts to think some of Britain’s department stores still sell fur.” The decision is thought to have been taken while Carrie Johnson was away at the weekend, as she was seen returning to No 10 with her children and some suitcases on Monday morning.",News/World news,Cabinet row as plan to ban fur and fois gras trade scrapped by PM,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/cabinet-row-as-plan-to-ban-fur-and-fois-gras-trade-scrapped-by-pm
2/22/2022,"The Fox anchor Neil Cavuto returned to the air on Monday, to say he nearly died from a second bout with the coronavirus and to tell detractors including those who sent death threats over his support for vaccines: “So sorry to disappoint you.”  More than 935,000 Americans have died of Covid-19 in the last two years. The seven-day average daily death rate is just under 2,000 – the vast majority unvaccinated. Fox has strict vaccination requirements for staff. But hosts, prominently including Tucker Carlson, have spread misinformation about vaccines and resistance to Covid-19 public health measures including vaccination mandates. Cavuto is immunocompromised, with multiple sclerosis and having survived heart surgery and cancer. After his first positive Covid test, in October, he implored viewers: “My God, stop the politics. Life is too short to be an ass. Life is way too short to be ignorant of the promise of something that is helping people worldwide. Stop the deaths, stop the suffering, please get vaccinated, please.” Some viewers did not stop the politics. Cavuto revealed that he received disturbing messages, including death threats. On Fox Business on Monday, Cavuto said he had been hospitalised for weeks but Fox had not publicised his condition out of respect for his privacy. His second Covid case, he said, was a “far, far more serious strand” because of his immunocompromised status. He had, he said, been “intensive care for quite a while”. “It was really touch and go,” he said. “Some of you who’ve wanted to put me out of my misery darn near got what you wished for. So sorry to disappoint you.” Cavuto also said: “Let me be clear: doctors say had I not been vaccinated at all, I wouldn’t be here. “This was scary. How scary? I’m talking, ‘Ponderosa suddenly out of the prime rib in the middle of the buffet line scary.’ That’s how scary.” He also dismissed the idea the vaccine caused or contributed to his second Covid bout. “No, the vaccine didn’t cause that,” he said. “That ‘grassy knoll’ theory has come up a lot. Because I’ve had cancer, and right now I have multiple sclerosis, I am among the vulnerable 3% or so of the population that cannot sustain the full benefits of a vaccine.” In October, Cavuto described some of the threats he received for taking and advocating the shot. He also said: “I cannot stress this enough: it’s not about left or right. This is not about who’s conservative or liberal. Last time I checked, everyone regardless of their political persuasion is coming down with this … “Take the political speaking points and toss them for now, I’m begging you. Toss them and think of what’s good not only for yourself but for those around you. “I dare say people who experienced this and see loved ones who have been affected by this or have died from this are not judging the wisdom of mandates. “They’re wishing they got vaccinated, and they didn’t.”",News/Media, Fox anchor survives second Covid case and tells detractors: ‘Sorry to disappoint’,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/22/neil-cavuto-fox-news-business-covid-vaccination-death-threats
2/22/2022,"The former backbench Tory MP Sir Richard Shepherd, who has died aged 79, ploughed a sometimes lonely but always widely respected furrow as one of the party’s libertarians, even when he fell foul of ministers’ wishes and the demands of three-line whips. Holding the executive to account was ultimately more important to him than toeing the party line. Independent-minded and eurosceptic, he gave fervent, even emotional, support to the concept of open government and freedom of information during a long career in the Commons. He was never promoted to ministerial office – nor would he probably have wanted to be – but he was, rather to his surprise and embarrassment, knighted in 2013. He stood down as an MP at the 2015 general election, after representing the constituency of Aldridge-Brownhills in the West Midlands for 36 years.  Shepherd was born in Aberdeen, the son of Davida (nee Wallace) and Alfred Shepherd, but educated in London, first at Isleworth grammar school and then at the London School of Economics, where he studied economics, going on afterwards to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1970 he set up a family grocery business, Shepherd Foods – the first convenience store chain to offer late-night shopping – and as an MP worked in the mornings from a backroom at the firm’s Drury Lane head office, assisted by his sister and secretary. He also founded, in 1972, the family’s more upmarket grocery company, Partridges, in the Sloane Street area of Chelsea, run by his brother, John, which received a royal warrant in 1994. Unlike an increasing number of Tory MPs therefore, he could claim first-hand and continuing business experience. A friend and former assistant to the longstanding Conservative backbench eurosceptic Teddy Taylor, Shepherd contested the Nottingham East constituency in the February 1974 election, but found a more permanent, though not necessarily safer, berth in the suburban Walsall seat of Aldridge-Brownhills, which he won from Labour in 1979 and held through the eight subsequent general elections. The conjunction between West Midlanders and their ascetic, intellectual, southerner MP was not necessarily an obvious one, but his home-owning, small-business-orientated constituents clearly appreciated Shepherd and although his majority slipped to just 2,500 in the Blair landslide of 1997, by 2010 it was 15,256 and he was elected with 59% of the vote. In the Commons, Shepherd was one of the Maastricht rebels of the 1990s, but he was never one of the swivel-eyed tendency of europhobes whom John Major characterised as needing the men with white coats. His was a more fastidious and principled opposition, based on constitutional considerations, concerning the sovereignty of parliament, rather than the ill-concealed xenophobia of some Maastricht rebels. This concern for parliamentary sovereignty led him to his stands against government secrecy, manipulation and dissembling, conveyed by his occasionally almost overwrought interventions as he stood, nearly alone on his side, against ministerial obfuscation. Never was this more pointed than in his defiance of a three-line whip to oppose the government’s handling of the Scott report into the arms to Iraq inquiry in 1996. The lengthy report, three years in the making, exposed ministerial inaccuracies and evasions and outright duplicity in the government’s prosecution of the Matrix Churchill engineering company, which had exported components to Iraq with what it understood to be ministers’ approval. Shepherd was outraged, voting against the government even though the embattled prime minister, Major, had made the issue a vote of confidence. In the event, showing just how brave Shepherd’s stand was, the administration survived with a majority of just one. His concern about individual liberty extended more widely too: he voted against the imposition of control orders on terrorist suspects, against the introduction of identity cards and against giving the authorities the power to detain suspects for lengthy periods without charge. Perhaps his most lasting memorial will be his private members’ bill protecting whistleblowers, which, highly unusually for a non-government measure, was incorporated in statute as part of the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. Shepherd exercised his own liberty as a smoker. He was genial and approachable and made friends across the political spectrum – including with Guardian journalists researching and campaigning on similar issues to his own. In 2000 he stood for Speaker of the Commons, coming third – an indication of fellow MPs’ esteem – as the Labour MP Michael Martin was elected thanks to Labour arm-twisting. In his constituency, Shepherd served as president of Walsall Football Club. He is survived by John.

2/22/2022,"As a child, there was a thrilling danger about growing up close to the open prison known as HMP North Sea Camp. My friends and I would ride our bikes up to nearby Freiston, Lincolnshire, which is where the prison stood between the town and the marshland coast. We would dare each other to inch closer to the gates, only talking in whispers. When the danger felt too close we would turn and pedal our little legs as fast as possible, never looking back until we were sure we were long from view. This week, an inmate escaped from the category D prison, which has minimal security and allows eligible prisoners to spend most of their day away from the prison. The sex offender Paul Robson, 56, absconded on Sunday 13 February, spending four days on the run before being arrested on Thursday in Skegness. Robson had been given a life sentence in 2000 for attempted rape and indecent sexual assault.  Robson’s escape comes as no surprise to those living in close proximity to the North Sea Camp – who are quite used to prisoners fleeing from the site, given there have been more than 100 reported in the past decade. My best friend recalls numerous occasions when the police have come knocking at the door of her family home to look for escapees. In 2013 the town was aghast after Alan Wilmot, then 49, raped a local woman while on day release. When I was at school in the 1990s, it was common knowledge that prisoners came in during the weekends or holidays to do painting and fixing work. To be fair, the school really needed it, but that about 60% of North Sea Camp’s 400 inmates are sex offenders made their presence in our school feel chilling. A friend who still lives locally tells me that they also worked at her secondary school. “One particular man called Dave had killed his wife with a saucepan after finding her in bed with his best friend,” she says. “We would ask them what they’d done to be inside as inquisitive teens.” I have twin 17-year-old sisters, one of whom attends my old school now, and as we chatted on the phone earlier this week I found myself telling them to do the opposite of what I did when I was younger – to stay at home. “It is really worrying,” one replied, adding they’d been glued to the local police Facebook page for updates. “The prisoners have been painting fences near our house the past couple of weeks, so we could have walked past him before he legged it,” she added. Police warned that Robson should not be approached as he “can cause real harm to anyone he comes across”. It’s more than reasonable, then, to ask why someone like Robson, described by a sentencing judge as a “menace to women and children”, was moved to an open prison in the first place. The answer lies with the Parole Board for England and Wales. The idea of open prisons is to build trust between offenders and the system; inmates are invited to complete their sentences under minimal supervision and aren’t usually locked up in cells. Growing up I was supportive of the idea that inmates could take up employment while on day release, helping them towards successful rehabilitation – which can only help bring to an end the cyclical relationship between prisons, poverty, underemployment, isolation and ultimately re-offending. But for dangerous sex offenders like Robson and Wilmot, was their move to open prison really appropriate? In 2015, Wilmot – who was first convicted of raping four women and committing a string of robberies – was given four additional life sentences and 15 years without a chance of parole for the crimes committed while on day release from North Sea Camp. The judge, who heard that Wilmot had received a warning for his deteriorating behaviour, said he was “very concerned as to how anybody could ever have thought it was safe to release him”. The Ministry of Justice overhauled the process for allowing prisoners out on day release as a result, and commissioned an independent investigation looking at strengthening the system. The MoJ revealed in 2020 that, since 2015, an estimated 631 inmates have absconded from institutions like North Sea Camp across the UK – in England there are 13 open prisons for men and two for women. In 2016 convicted murderer Darren Jackson, 51, sparked a nationwide manhunt after fleeing HMP Sudbury in Derbyshire, after being moved there despite a documented history of attempted breakouts. He was sentenced to life in 1986 for killing 29-year-old mother-of-three Gill Ellis as she walked home in Burnley, Lancashire. Eighteen men who escaped in this time period were convicted rapists, seven were convicted of manslaughter and four caused death by dangerous driving. While absconding rates have fallen over the years, families of victims like Ellis are perplexed by decisions that quite obviously leave the public unsafe. A report promised by summer 2021 from justice minister Lucy Frazer QC, looking to review the parole system in England in the face of calls for reform, has yet to materialise. Labour’s shadow justice secretary Steve Reed wrote to the lord chancellor, Dominic Raab, this week to seek assurances over public safety after this latest blunder by the Parole Board. But more than assurances, we need reform. Usually, overturning decisions deemed dangerous, especially to women, like the subsequently overturned release of John Worboys in 2017 for example, come down to the efforts of public protest. Victims of these offenders are rarely told when their attackers are given day release or, in Worboys’ case, released on licence. My sisters are now the ones living near to that Frieston border that me and my friends used to cross on our bikes, and speak in the same hushed voices about the close danger they too can sense. Robson may have been caught again, but while the system remains inadequate, there are still a whole host of other dangerous offenders putting another generation at risk. As it ever was, that peripheral fear – a chill, just off in the distance – remains. Zoe Beaty is a freelance writer",Opinion/Opinion,I grew up near an open prison.

2/22/2022,"Germany has stopped the certification process for the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in reaction to Russia’s recognition of the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk in east Ukraine, chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced. Germany’s energy minister, Robert Habeck, on Tuesday morning instructed the withdrawal of an assessment required to authorise the pipeline between Russia and Germany.  “This may sound technical, but it is the necessary administrative step without which the pipeline cannot be certified,” Scholz said at a press conference in Berlin at midday. “Without this certification Nord Stream 2 cannot go into operation”. Scholz said he has commissioned a new assessment into Germany’s energy security in the light of geopolitical developments in east Ukraine. The German leader described Putin’s recognition of the Russian-controlled territories as a “grave breach” of international law that broke with decades of agreements between Russia and the west. “The situation today is fundamentally different,” he said. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy giant Gazprom has been built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. The construction of the pipeline was completed last September and its operator says it is already filled with gas and ready to go into use, pending permission from German authorities. Social Democrat Scholz, who was sworn in as German chancellor last December, has skirted around the Nord Stream 2 debate in the first weeks of his tenure, with his spokespeople initially sticking to the line that the pipeline was a purely commercial project. As tensions heightened on Ukraine’s border with Russia, Scholz said that “all options are on the table” when it came to sanctions against a possible incursion, but still refrained from naming Nord Stream – until now.",News/World news,Germany halts Nord Stream 2 approval over Russian recognition of Ukraine ‘republics’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/germany-halts-nord-stream-2-approval-over-russian-recognition-of-ukraine-republics
