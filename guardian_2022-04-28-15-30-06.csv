4/28/2022,"One of the most familiar visual tropes to emerge from the pandemic has been that of Serious People seated in front of their bookshelves. Whether it’s a cabinet minister on television or an accountant working from home, the poetics of Zoom insist on a backdrop of titles composed of equal parts stuffy professional manual, well‑thumbed Penguin Classic and, for those who like to raise the stakes, last year’s International Booker prize shortlist. Books don’t just furnish a room, they semaphore to the world exactly how you yourself would like to be read. In this brilliantly written account of the book-as-material-object, Emma Smith explains that people have been posing in front of their libraries ever since Gutenberg started cranking up the printing press. Before, in fact: one of her earliest revelations is that people in China and Korea were printing books several centuries before sluggish northern Europe got round to it. Still, one of the most deft proponents of the early “shelfie” was Jeanne Antoinette Poisson, also known as Madame de Pompadour, companion of Louis XV. In the 1750s, when Jeanne was making the tricky move from maîtresse-en-titre to femme savante, she enrolled her favourite painter, François Boucher, to manage the transformation. From now on he was to paint her either against a backdrop of crammed bookshelves or, better still, actually reading a book and looking thoughtful about it. Boucher was careful to give bookish Jeanne the same creamy décolletage and luscious sweep of a silk gown that featured in her early publicity portraits, on the grounds that there was no reason why a woman couldn’t be clever and sexy too. It was a message that Marilyn Monroe took to heart when in 1955 she posed for the famous photograph taken by Eve Arnold, in which she wears a swimsuit while absorbed in Ulysses, a novel often described as unreadable. The following year Monroe would marry playwright Arthur Miller, prompting Variety’s famous headline: “Egghead Weds Hourglass”. Monroe’s “shelfie”, then, functions along similar lines to Madame de Pompadour’s careful self-staging as she transitions from pin-up to public intellectual. In Portable Magic – the phrase is borrowed from Stephen King – Smith’s subject is the materiality of reading, or what she calls “bookhood”. Books in their physical form turn out to be endlessly adaptable, not just in the domestic space as doorstops, yoga blocks, and occasional kindling when times are tough, but out in the world too. In the first world war, pocket-sized Bibles were clad in full metal jackets in the hope that, carried close to the heart, they might save a soldier from enemy fire while also saving his soul. More mundane is the revelation that, at the beginning of this century, fragments of some 2.5m copies of Mills & Boon novels were used to create an absorbent, noise-reducing layer for surfacing the M6 toll motorway in the Midlands. This, though, should not be taken as a comment on commercial romantic fiction: Smith reminds us that being turned into substratum, or something like it, is the fate of most books, high or low. Her own publisher, the esteemed Penguin Random House, runs a large “centralised returns processing site” in Essex which shreds, crushes and bales around 25,000 of its own books every single day. More joyous altogether is Smith’s retelling of the creative intervention perpetrated by Joe Orton and his lover Kenneth Halliwell on their library books in the late 1950s and early 60s. Each week the men would take out the lustreless novels available from their local Islington branch and spend the intervening weeks snipping out the cover images and patching them up with something surreal before returning the books for circulation. Phyllis Hambledon’s 1960 bodice ripper, Queen’s Favourite, had its cover repurposed so that, instead of a young wasp-waisted woman in a ruff, the main figures were now two bare-chested male wrestlers. In a study of John Betjeman the photograph of the straw-hatted poet was replaced with one of a pot-bellied and heavily tattooed man in his underpants. Orton and Halliwell also had their way with blurbs, so that the inside flap for Gaudy Nights hailed Dorothy L Sayers “at her most queer, and needless to say, at her most crude!” Smith reads Orton and Halliwell’s actions as a kind of queer performance art. They were not vandals or, at least, that is not all they were. The books they roughed up were mass-produced and easily replaced – this was not the literary equivalent of drawing moustaches on old masters. Rather, the men were engaged in a protest against the relentlessly middle-brow, heteronormative pap on offer to the citizens of Islington. Within a couple of years, Orton wrote Loot and Entertaining Mr Sloane, the avant garde plays that shook up a British theatre that was already bored with the kitchen sink dramas of the late 1950s. Still, Orton believed that the reason he and Halliwell were sentenced to six months’ imprisonment was because they were gay at a time when homosexuality was illegal. The Daily Express reported, on the same page as the Orton–Halliwell book trial, that a drunken driver who had killed his passenger received the same sentence as the book vandals of Essex Road. When the muddle-headed puritans worried about the “poison” that Orton and Halliwell were releasing into the body politic they were drawing on ancient terrors about the book as a vector of disease. As late as 1907, public health authorities decreed that any volume from a household recently visited by smallpox, cholera or tuberculosis should be disinfected, if not destroyed, for fear that it might carry contamination far and wide. Smith is quick to see a parallel here with the early days of the pandemic, when government guidelines warned that books that had been bought online should be quarantined for 72 hours before being deemed safe to handle. How thrilling, then, to learn that this principle can also work the other way round. Smith explains that ancient volumes are now being harvested for accumulated DNA – skin cells and traces of nasal mucus from sneezes – left behind by early readers. At one level this allows us to glimpse people from the past as they lean over a particular volume: the detritus from a 1637 American Bible recently revealed the DNA of a northern European reader who suffered from acne. More therapeutically, plans are in play to swab old books to gather genetic material that predates modern medical problems such as antibiotic resistance. Portable Magic is a love song to the book as a physical object. In tactile prose Smith reminds us of the thrills and spills of shabby covers, the illicit delight of writing in margins when you have been told not to and the guilty joy that comes from poring over traces left by someone else. It is these haptic, visceral and even slightly seedy pleasures of “bookhood” that she brings so brilliantly to life.

4/28/2022,"Scott Morrison has contrasted his “busy” schedule while isolating with Covid earlier this year with Anthony Albanese’s “quiet” week at home during the campaign, while pushing for two commercial TV election debates next week. The prime minister contracted Covid prior to calling the election and isolated at home in Sydney early in March. Albanese is about to complete his week of isolation after testing positive last Thursday. “I’m looking forward to him re-joining the campaign,” Morrison told the Nine Network on Wednesday. “He’s had a pretty quiet week. I remember when I was in iso I had a very busy week attending Quad summits and doing all those sorts of things.” Morrison was chided by the Nine presenter Allison Langdon. “Oh, come on. He’s been out there. He’s been zooming. He’s been doing his best,” she said. During his week of isolation, Albanese did five television interviews and eight radio interviews, as well as liaising with his campaign team. Morrison has not yet answered a request from the national broadcaster to join a leaders’ election debate on 9 May and signalled he wants two debates on the Nine and Seven networks next week after Albanese emerges from isolation. The Labor campaign has proposed a National Press Club debate in the closing week of the campaign ahead of the 21 May election. It would be moderated by the club’s president Laura Tingle. There is always jostling over election debates but the press club has played the leading role in hosting them since the mid-1980s. Labor’s campaign director, Paul Erickson, has written to his Liberal counterpart, Andrew Hirst, seeking agreement for the press club face-off on 18 May. Erickson noted the Liberals had been “extremely eager” to stage a single moderator debate at the club during the 2019 contest. “A National Press Club debate during the election campaign was good enough for John Howard, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull – and good enough for Mr Morrison in 2019,” Erickson said. “Given your enthusiasm for this format in 2019, I can’t imagine why you would not be similarly willing to agree now.” A debate at the press club, hosted by Tingle, the chief political correspondent for the ABC’s nightly current affairs program 7.30 and a two-time Walkley award winner, could be carried live by all Australian television networks. The ABC is also proposing a 9 May debate moderated by the Insiders host and three-time Walkley winner David Speers. The ABC has proposed a prime time Leaders' Debate on Monday May 9, available live across the ABC main channel, news channel, radio, iView and YouTube. The ABC's Managing Director has written to both major parties, highlighting the importance of a debate on the public broadcaster. Morrison and Albanese have squared off in one debate thus far hosted by the pay TV broadcaster Sky News. The first debate was a town hall format with swinging voters posing questions to the leaders and a majority in the audience scored the encounter for the Labor leader. The prime minister told reporters in Cairns on Thursday he was available for two debates next week hosted by commercial free-to-air broadcasters. The Seven debate would be hosted by the network’s political editor, Mark Riley, another Walkley winner, while Nine has proposed a panel of presenters and senior journalists. The Liberal party has not declined the other proposals but Morrison signalled three encounters was a good number. Similarly, Labor has not declined the proposed debates hosted by Nine, Seven and the ABC, but campaign strategists would prefer Albanese had a chance to recover fully from his bout of Covid-19. The Labor leader is due out of isolation on Thursday night and will head west ahead of the ALP’s official campaign launch in Perth on Sunday. * Katharine Murphy is a former long-time board member of the National Press Club",News/Australia news,Morrison takes aim at Albanese’s ‘quiet week’ with Covid amid wrangling over election debates ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/28/morrison-takes-aim-at-albaneses-quiet-week-with-covid-amid-wrangling-over-election-debates
4/28/2022,"For Matt Tannenbaum’s bookstore in Lennox, Massachusetts – simply known as The Bookstore – the Covid-19 pandemic was transformational, but not in the way you might think. When the lockdowns were imposed, business quickly came to a near standstill, with Tannenbaum’s weekly sales amounting to what a good day might have been pre-Covid. The situation grew dire, and then he decided to try raising money through the popular donation platform GoFundMe. Very suddenly, everything changed. Tannenbaum’s GoFundMe didn’t just meet its target – staggeringly, it actually doubled its $60,000 goal in just two days of operations, instantly changing The Bookstore from a business that had long operated in the red to one that was flush with cash reserves. Speaking on the remarkable upwelling of community support, Tannanbaum told me, “I knew it was there, because people had been telling me for years how much they cared about the store. It was just delight squared.” This sudden infusion of cash turned Tannenbaum into a completely different kind of small business owner than he had been before Covid. “I never had money before in my life,” he said. “I can actually get out of debt now. I have a backup now. I can place larger orders and have more stock and be more successful as a bookseller.” Laughing, he concluded, “So I learned, after three-quarters of a century of being alive, that if you have money you can make money.” Film-maker Adam Zax happened to be in the middle of shooting a multi-year documentary about his friend Tannenbaum and The Bookstore when these remarkable events transpired. It is to the credit of Zax and his movie, Hello, Bookstore (the name comes from Tannenbaum’s greeting when he answers the phone), that he chooses not to let this Cinderella moment dominate but instead lets it be just one panel in a much larger collage that captures the feel and flow of the life of this independent bookstore. The resultant movie is an offbeat, extremely atmospheric look at what longstanding small businesses and entrepreneurs like Tannenbaum mean to the communities that surround them. Taking his cues from documentarians like Frederick Wiseman and the Maysles brothers, Zax is far more concerned with ambience and texture than plotting or making a point. Hello, Bookstore moves slowly, encompassing multitudes as innumerable small moments collect around its subject. “I’ve always loved fly on the wall documentaries,” Zax told me. “I’ve never really responded to the talking head style of movies. I don’t want to hammer in things, I want there to be a sense of discovery while you’re watching it. With the rhythm of [Hello, Bookstore], I took my cue from the store. I thought that, if we can get the atmosphere right, the contours of the story will figure out where they need to go. I wanted it to be cozy and relaxing, like you’re in a bookstore.” Hello, Bookstore does indeed succeed in capturing the quiet, calming feel of being in a great independent bookstore. Zax tends to use lengthy, static shots that give each scene time to slowly develop, leisurely finding their purpose. Often the action is around Tannenbaum speaking to longtime patrons of The Bookstore or his two adult daughters; we also frequently see him engaging in a favored pastime: evangelizing for great literature by reading aloud passages to whomever will listen. Although the effect of Zax’s approach can be at first jarring, confounding a viewer’s expectations, over time the unusual flow of the movie becomes more and more compelling, its rhythms more familiar and lulling. Pre-pandemic footage of Tannenbaum’s bookstore shows a bustling, quirky business complete with wine bar where “our motto is, you can’t drink all day unless you start in the morning.” Nearly everything carries a story with it, including the wine bar itself, a memorial to a friend who barely survived the Holocaust, and then lived to the age of 90 years, dying in 2010. Zax told me that his intent in these shots “was to capture the soul of the shop and what Matt has created here, all these sorts of layers underneath that show how shops like The Bookstore are the lifeblood of our community.” These shots of Tannenbaum, laughing and relaxed, releasing a seemingly unending stream of commentary while handselling to his customers, alternate with much more static and morose scenes wherein the very same man laboriously takes down credit card information through a glass window and directs customers to stand back as he ceremoniously places their purchase on a stool just outside the front door. “When Covid hit,” said Zax, “at first there was a sadness about not being able to show the bookstore as I knew it. Not being able to continue showing it in its glory. And then it was an acknowledgment that I have the privilege to be filming in an unprecedented time. This was what I was given, to show this transition from the old world into this new world. Once I started accepting that, it became clear that everything I was exploring in the subtext, like the age of Amazon, what’s a bookstore to a community, it all came forward through this process with Covid.” About one-third of the way through Hello, Bookstore, apparently during the early days of the pandemic, Tannenbaum sits at his computer behind looming bottles of Clorox bleach and hand sanitizer, reading aloud from Willa Cather’s My Ántonia with a sense of wonder: “That is happiness; to be dissolved into something complete and great.” The scene is just an isolated moment, but one senses that here Tannenbaum is nourishing himself with literature to sustain his hope when so much has been taken away from him. Cather’s sentiment echoes how Zax’s camera elegantly captures Tannenbaum seeping into the community at large through language and storytelling, finding his happiness through these interactions. “I’m very centered on the needs and desires of my customers,” Tannenbaum told me, “and I’ll take my lead from them and what they want. It’s like being a therapist, and I get to visit them every day. I try to be there for each customer.” Toward the end of Hello, Bookstore, after the miraculous GofundMe campaign that saves his business, Tannenbaum is musing with a reporter from The Boston Globe on what would have happened if he had needed to sell out and move on. “Who would spend all the hours that I spend for the little pay that I get?” he asks. Clearly, the answer is “no one,” because Tannenbaum has created a space that is his and his alone. Hello, Bookstore succeeds because Zax has managed to occupy this space alongside him and observe this symbiotic relationship between man and bookstore, bookstore and community. The movie is an earnest and urgent homage to a community space that many are now looking for as the pandemic subsides and we make our way back out into the world. Hello, Bookstore opens at New York’s Film Forum on 29 April and in further cities on 6 May with a UK date to be announced",Arts/Film,‘It’s like being a therapist’: the highs and lows of an independent bookstore,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/27/hello-bookstore-hulu-matt-tannenbaum-adam-zax-documentary
4/28/2022,"Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, has refused to comment on a leaked report from the anti-corruption watchdog that reportedly found the state branch of the Labor party condoned the misuse of public funds. The Independent Broad-based Anti-Corruption Commission (Ibac) and the Victorian Ombudsman have been investigating allegations that former minister Adem Somyurek enlisted the help of staff for branch-stacking work, as part of Operation Watts. Somyurek has conceded involvement in branch-stacking and that his staff did political work. But he maintains these activities were widespread across politics and permitted under the legislation governing the use of electorate officers. The practice, which involves paying for other people’s Labor party memberships, was allegedly done to boost his moderate faction’s influence and ensure preferred candidates were preselected. It is not illegal, but Labor party rules prohibit payments for other people’s memberships. Ibac and the ombudsman are investigating whether Victorian MPs engaged in corrupt conduct by directing ministerial or electorate office staff – paid for with public funds – to perform such work. According to the Age, Ibac’s draft report is said to have found the “unethical practices” exposed in its investigation were not confined to the moderate faction of the party and it is “highly likely” the misuse of publicly funded staff and employment of family members and factional allies was widespread. Ibac reportedly concluded such practices had been “approved or condoned by party leadership for decades”. The draft report reportedly says 26 witnesses, including Andrews, were interviewed by Ibac in private while Somyurek and six others faced public hearings. The premier is said to have told Ibac that significant cultural reform was required within the party. At a press conference on Thursday, Andrews refused to answer questions about the leaked report. “It is grossly inappropriate for me to be talking about these matters before a final report has been tabled,” Andrews said. “Until that time, my position on this will not change.” Andrews said several steps had been taken to reform Victorian Labor, including to place the party under administration and suspend voting rights for rank and file members until 2023, to allow for a comprehensive audit of every member. “But of course, we’re always ready to do more, to take further steps,” he said. Somyurek was dumped from cabinet and quit the Labor party before it moved to expelled him, while his allies Marlene Kairouz and Robin Scott resigned from the frontbench after their faction was the subject of an investigation by the Age and 60 Minutes in June 2020. Kairouz and Scott have not be preselected to represent the party at the November state election. Immediately after the 2020 reports, Andrews wrote to the national executive to place to Victorian branch under administration and the matter was referred to Ibac. He said there was a “significant problem” in the branch and apologised to Labor “true believers”. “I apologise for your pain and guarantee you that when this reform work is finished, not only will your voice be heard but it will be louder than it has ever been,” Andrews said at the time. Late last year, Ibac commissioner Robert Redlich QC and ombudsman Deborah Glass wrote to Victorian political parties to inform them they were considering whether there should be a ban on the employment of close relatives by MPs, and if the staffing allocation and electorate office budgets should be reduced. They said parliamentary reforms in 2019 that prohibited electorate officers from doing “party-specific activity” at work – after Labor’s so-called red shirts scandal – “have not deterred” MPs. Ibac must give accused parties an opportunity to respond to the allegations in the report before it is tabled to parliament. Somyurek took to Twitter on Thursday to accuse Ibac of leaking the report. “IBACs drop of its report before those mentioned in report have a chance to respond is a denial of procedural fairness,” he said in a post. A spokesperson for Ibac said as a matter of practice, it did not comment on investigations before it. The opposition leader, Matthew Guy, said he had not seen the draft report but described its reported contents as “concerning”. He said the Coalition’s integrity policy, to be released soon, would include additional funding for Victoria’s probity bodies.",News/Australia news,Daniel Andrews refuses to comment on leaked Ibac report into Victorian Labor party,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/28/daniel-andrews-refuses-to-comment-on-leaked-ibac-report-into-victorian-labor-party
4/28/2022,"Good morning, and welcome back to First Edition, which I hope you’ve already recommended to three of your friends. For one measure of the clarity of the government’s plan to alleviate the cost of living crisis, consider the rollercoaster ride of its view of a windfall tax on oil and gas profits yesterday: first Dominic Raab said it would be “disastrous”. Then Boris Johnson said it was a “tax on business”. Then Rishi Sunak said “nothing is ever off the table”. All of this a day after the PM asked his cabinet for solutions he could put in place for free. For today’s newsletter, then, we’re asking: what are the measures that could help the people most affected by this crisis – and is getting your MOT less often one of them? The Guardian’s economics correspondent Richard Partington answered my questions about it all, and then I wrote it up in a way that made me sound more knowledgable than I am. Perk of the job. That’s it from me this week – Nimo Omer, our assistant editor, will be bringing you tomorrow’s newsletter. Here are today’s headlines. 1. Ukraine | Vladimir Putin warned of a “lightning fast” retaliation if western countries intervened in Ukraine. UK foreign secretary Liz Truss last night said the UK’s goal was “to push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine”. 2. #MeToo | The former BBC DJ Tim Westwood has “stepped down” from his Capital Xtra show until further notice, following the allegations of sexual misconduct made against him by multiple black women. 3. Climate crisis | Human damage to the planet’s land is accelerating, with up to 40% now classed as degraded, UN data shows. A report said that half of the world’s people are suffering the impacts. 4. Politics | The government chief whip is investigating complaints that a Conservative frontbencher watched pornography next to colleagues in the chamber. The news follows reports that 56 MPs from across parliament are facing sexual harassment complaints. 5. Coronavirus | The government’s policy of sending untested residents back to care homes in England at the start of the pandemic was illegal, a court ruled. Bereaved families said their loved ones had been “thrown to the wolves”. The increase in the cost of living is already at the very top of most people’s list of worries, and it’s only just beginning to bite. In September last year, with post-pandemic demand rocketing, we were already calling the situation a “perfect storm”. “And then the war in Ukraine started,” Richard said. “And because of Russia’s position as a huge exporter of gas and oil, the problem got bigger.” Last month, the Office for Budget Responsibility said that with inflation going up fast, it expected living standards in the UK to fall at their fastest rate since the 1950s. So who is hurt when a perfect storm gets even worse, and what might the government do to help people? The problem The really crucial thing to understand about the cost of living crisis is this: its biggest impacts are on the worst off. Even if the impacts were evenly spread, the poorest would obviously feel them most – but this time “it’s particularly severe because lower income households spend more of their income on energy,” Richard said. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has produced some stark analysis setting this out: in March, they estimated that as the spike in energy costs bites, middle-income households will spend about 7% of their income on energy costs, against 19% for low income families. For single people on low incomes, it’s just under 50%. The offer Let’s do the serious bit first, if only because the less serious bit may annoy you so much that you stop reading. In his spring statement, the chancellor Rishi Sunak set out a series of measures – like a cut in fuel duty, and a £3,000 increase to the income threshold at which you start to make national insurance contributions – that he said would help. That was on top of an energy package of council tax rebates and repayable loans announced a month earlier. It added up to £17.6bn. “The Office for Budget Responsibility said that would offset about half the blow to household finances from higher energy and fuel bills,” Richard said – or a third of the overall fall in living standards they would otherwise have faced. That leaves a big gap to fill, and here’s the less serious bit. This week, the prime minister had a big idea: a cabinet brainstorming session. Ideas would have to be ‘fiscally neutral’ – another term for ‘free’ – to introduce, just as it’s fiscally neutral when estate agents try to increase the value of a house by rearranging pot plants for the photos. Here are some of the cabinet’s pot plants:  Let childminders care for more children at the same time to bring costs down Reduce the frequency of MOTs from once a year to once every two years Remind phone and broadband companies to let people know if they could be on a lower rate Let’s bear in mind that £17.6bn worth of measures covered a third of the increase in the cost of living. Where would this cornucopia of freebies get us? Richard pauses, sounding genuinely a bit baffled for the only time in our conversation, and then talks to me kindly and slowly, as if to a small child. “It’s tiny,” he said. “What’s an MOT, fifty quid? It’s tiny. And they’re not aimed at the people who need help the most.” The solutions So waiting until next year to check your car isn’t going to crash *may* not be the panacea for massive inflation that you thought. What might actually help? Richard helpfully explains the obvious once more: “The most powerful way of targeting people who need it is the benefits system.” One big lever the government could have pulled, Richard says, is the upcoming increase in universal credit, which was pegged to inflation – 3.1% – in September last year. “We were already at 7% in March, and it’s forecast to be 9% in April, which is when the increase in benefits will actually come in,” he said. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said last month that raising benefits by 8.1%, rather than the dated 3.1% benchmark used by the government, would cost the exchequer an additional £9bn. “That would have had a substantial effect in protecting the poorest.” Rishi Sunak’s newfound openness to a windfall tax on oil and gas profits, which Labour says would raise about £1.2bn, is described by a Treasury source quoted in the Telegraph this morning as “a warning shot”. In the meantime, he has about £30bn to play with to stay within his own fiscal limits. But he wants to leave “fuel in the tank” – partly, many observers suspect, so he can cut taxes closer to an election, but also because the cost of servicing the national debt could be forced up by inflation. “And he has an argument,” Richard said. “We’ve already seen some of that headroom eroded.” Yet there is a plausible alternative story – about a chancellor and a government who have prioritised crowd-pleasing general measures and gimmicks above easing the pain for the very worst off. “The targets he has set himself – chancellors for decades have missed them when they’ve had to,” said Richard. “It still comes down to choices in the end. The sky isn’t going to fall in. But it feels like that isn’t part of the debate.” Cricket | Ben Stokes will be named the new captain of the England test side on Thursday. The all-rounder succeeds Joe Root after a disastrous winter for the team. Football | Liverpool turned their dominance into a 2-0 victory over Villarreal in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final at Anfield. Football | Women playing in the Italian top flight are finally to be deemed fully professional, removing a pay cap of 30,000 euros a year. The move was described as an “epochal change”. You might have seen Martin Chulov’s piece yesterday about how two academics hunted down a Syrian war criminal, or heard the first half of a Today in Focus two-parter from Michael Safi and Alex Atack on the story. The second episode of the podcast is out this morning, and it’s just as stunning a piece of work. Archie I loved this introspective article by Courtney Maum on her relationship with a race horse that was abandoned and abused. It’s a really touching story that explores the limits of human generosity. Nimo Bernadine Evaristo’s piece about older Black women “totally smashing it” in the arts is, unsurprisingly, beautifully written. Stick around for her interesting reflections on why she’s glad she didn’t win the Booker sooner. Archie As exam season approaches, George Monbiot asks: “why are we doing this to our children?” Monbiot persuasively argues that exams do little more than preserve privilege, urging people instead to call for a system that doesn’t make inequality worse. Nimo Today in NSFW internet dystopia: Rolling Stone interviewed the woman whose obvious Twitter joke started a surreal moral panic over Snickers removing… well, read it to find out what, and don’t say you weren’t warned. Archie The Guardian’s lead is “Fear of energy price crisis as Russia cuts gas supply” while the Times says “Truss fears Ukraine war could carry on for years”. The Telegraph has “Energy firms face threat of windfall tax”. It also has the porn in the Commons story, which is the splash in the Mirror, “Sleazy party’s new low … Tory’s porn shame in Commons” – as well as the Express, “Tory MP ‘caught watching porn in Commons’” – and the Metro, “Porn MP exposed”. The i has “20 warnings missed to stop Covid slaughter in care homes”. The Daily Mail’s top story is “Police review over Starmer’s lockdown drinks”. The Sun’s front-page lead is “Gospel truth: I’m done” about Tyson Fury saying he is hanging up his gloves. The Financial Times has “Gas price soars as Russia turns off taps to Poland and Bulgaria”. A genocide researcher investigating a 2013 atrocity committed in Syria creates an alternate online identity – the character of ‘Anna S’ – to entice a military commander to confess to war crimes. But how far can she push? And how long can Anna go on? A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad Ugandan fashion designer Bobby Kolade is helping to address the industry’s sustainability crisis, and curb the seemingly endless flow of second hand clothes to Africa with his new brand “Return to Sender”. As the name suggests, Kolade’s brand is made up entirely of second hand clothes sent from western countries to Uganda that he then sells back in the global north. Kolade’s ingenuity has landed him critical acclaim, helped revitalise Uganda’s textile industry, all while remaining eco-friendly.

4/28/2022,"Brownies are to learn coding and Guides will investigate chatbots in a bid to shift stubborn attitudes among girls that science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) careers are just for boys. The drive to engage thousands more girls in technology comes after research by Girlguiding found more than half (52%) of girls and women between the ages of 11 and 21 believed that Stem was for boys. The strength of feeling is unchanged since 2016. Courses will include Happy Appy, a session on apps for Rainbows, the guides’ branch for four- to seven-year-olds. Primary-age girls are far less likely to consider Stem a preserve of boys than those aged above 11, polling shows, by which point attitudes among many are already baked in. Girls and women remain underrepresented in some key Stem school subjects and careers. More than 14% of male students progress from maths GCSE to A-level, compared with only 9% of female students, while the figures for physics were 8.3% and 2.2%. However, girls who took A-level physics were more likely than boys to get a top grade. The percentage of women in the core Stem workforce in England slipped 2% from 26% in 2019 to 24% in 2020, according to analysis of government figures. Maddie Wray-Reynolds, 23, a Guides and Brownies leader in Cheltenham, said it was “really sad” to hear some Brownies say recently that “they couldn’t be a doctor because they were a girl”. She said she was called “a geek” and “a nerd” at secondary school because of her interest in computing and was made to feel ashamed of her passion for Formula One motor racing. Related Brownie badges include aviation, invention and space while Guides cover science, computing, robotics and engineering. But the most popular badges in Brownies are baking, mindfulness and performing and among Guides they are mixology (non-alcoholic), upcycling and backwoods cooking. Nicole McWilliams, who leads the engineering group for Android smartphones at Google, which is supporting the courses, said: “People think about drawing and painting as what creativity is but technology is incredibly creative. It’s like a blank canvas and a box of crayons.” Peyton Mitchell, 10, a Brownie from Hemel Hempstead, said: “It’s unfair that people think it is more for boys. We all use [technology] in our daily lives.” Asked about female role models, she said: “Most of the girls in my class don’t know anyone we can look up to if they want to be an engineer.” Daljit Kaur, a former computer science teacher who works for Stem Learning, a government-backed organisation which aims to improve science and technology teaching, said she had noticed that girls aged nine and 10 had no problem getting stuck into experimenting with a robot, but by the age of 12 “they become more hesitant, they don’t want to break it”. She said that once pushed, the girls were as successful as boys. Meanwhile, half of the Scouts membership lost during the pandemic has returned with the restart of in-person meetings.

4/28/2022,"Efforts are under way to get emergency contraception into Ukrainian hospitals as quickly as possible, as reports of rape after the Russian invasion continue to rise. About 25,000 packets of the medication, also known as the morning-after pill, have been sent by International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) to Ukraine, while a network of volunteers across Europe has been collecting donations of the medication from abroad and delivering them to hospitals. “The timeframe for treating victims of sexual violence is really essential,” said Julie Taft, of IPPF. “If a woman is seen within five days of an event, then that medication should automatically be given to her.” Taft said the IPPF was also sending medical abortion pills, which can be used up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. While emergency contraception was widely available in Ukraine, the war has destroyed local supply chains, caused a displacement of patients and healthcare providers, and increased the rate of sexual assaults. “There is a demand for emergency contraception, but very rarely from hospitals in the west. It is mostly hospitals to the east, in Kharkiv, Mariupol, those regions,” said Joel Mitchell from Paracrew, a humanitarian aid organisation delivering food and medical equipment to Ukraine. “As soon as we made contact with hospitals in those regions, we had standing orders for that medication.” It is not clear how many of the recipients of the medication are sexual assault victims, but a volunteer with Paracrew told the Guardian that he delivered emergency contraception directly to one hospital in a town north of Kyiv, where he says he was told by hospital staff a number of rape victims were being treated. Ukraine’s human rights commissioner, Lyudmila Denisova, said in early April that there were nine official cases of women who were pregnant after being raped by Russian soldiers. The reports of rape victims raise concerns about areas in the east, which continue to be under Russian occupation. Alona Zubchenko from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) said that in a crisis situation reported cases of violence, including rape, are likely “just the tip of the iceberg.” The UN has previously included emergency contraception in “post-rape kits” to hundreds of women and girls in armed conflicts around the world, including the Bosnian war. In addition to emergency contraception, survivors typically were given medication preventing STDs such a hepatitis B and HIV. Distributing the medication to rape survivors in post-conflict zones remains a UN policy. So far UN has sent 40 metric tonnes (40,000 kg) of reproductive health supplies to Ukraine and 33 Clinical Management of Rape (CMR) and Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) kits to 19 Hospitals in 10 regions in Ukraine. Denisova has said her office had officially documented the cases of 25 women who were kept in a basement and systematically raped in Bucha, a town north of Kyiv now synonymous with Russian war crimes, but the true number of victims could be far higher. A volunteer who evacuated residents from the towns north of Kyiv at the beginning of April told the Guardian: “What usually happens is that survivors of rape initially want to tell their story but then they go away and it isn’t until months later that they come back to talk.” She said she had encountered three women in the region who came out of houses and basements naked. One, immediately taken by ambulance, had been badly beaten and had broken bones. The Guardian reported this week that postmortem examinations on bodies in mass graves north of Kyiv revealed evidence that some women had been raped before being killed by Russian forces. “There are multiple psychological, emotional and physical health issues that the survivor is coping with and the anxiety around possible pregnancy is really enormous for many women,” said Taft. “It can lead to stress and PTSD, so being able to prevent it in the first place is key.” However, the supply of pills within Ukraine has been badly damaged by the invasion and volunteers who spoke to the Guardian described multiple logistical issues delaying attempts to get the much-needed medication into the country. “Many pharmaceuticals were previously produced in Ukraine but much of that manufacturing has stopped or became stuck in major cities because transportation is not safe,” said Taft. “Additionally, the current capacity of health providers and commodities [is insecure], particularly because we’re seeing a lot of destruction of health facilities.” Aleksandra Weder Sawicka, a Polish activist based in Oslo who worked with Paracrew, coordinated a collection of 500 pills from Norway but drew scrutiny from the Norwegian directorate of health, which did not condone the informal donation of the medication. A big pharmacy chain in Norway also refused to deliver the medication to her for that reason. She has had to stop further donations while she tries to reach an agreement with Norwegian authorities to allow her to continue the work. Taft said the strict control of the medication in some countries along Ukraine’s border, such as Romania, Hungary and Poland, had made the procurement of the pills more expensive, challenging and time consuming. “In those countries you can’t buy emergency medication in bulk,” she said, “so we had to procure them from providers in Denmark and the Netherlands.” Krystyna Kacpura, director of Federa, a Polish organisation advocating for women’s rights and reproductive health, said: “International organisations reached out in the first days of the war offering to send over emergency contraception, but we had to advise them to send it straight to Ukraine through the Czech Republic, as we couldn’t be seen handling controlled substances.”",News/Global development,Rush to get emergency contraception into Ukraine as reports of rape rise,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/28/russia-ukraine-emergency-contraception-amid-rape-reports
4/28/2022,"Ihave seen My Fair Lady an alarming number of times but never on stage. The musical is coming to the Coliseum in London and, when this was announced, I learned that Amara Okereke, who is playing Eliza Doolittle, is reported to have watched the film version more than 200 times. Now, it’s not a competition, but I reckon I’m up there with those sorts of numbers. I’d not seen the film for years, as I did most of my watching in early childhood while I was being looked after by my grandma. Back then, grandmas weren’t armed with the same childcare tools. There was no on-demand kids’ TV, iPads or YouTube so she had to rely on the humble VHS to entertain a preschooler. She narrowed the suitability of her video collection down to a fairly small number of classic musicals. My Fair Lady was a weekly watch. Other musicals in my gran’s collection included Carousel, Oklahoma! and Oliver! but My Fair Lady was my favourite. I reckon it could be because the female protagonist felt different from others of the era. Eliza is outspoken, noisy and funny, and transforms herself to become princess-like with real poise and beauty. Eliza is not treated well by the male characters but as a younger person I don’t think the misogyny really registered. A child may not have a nuanced view on Professor Henry Higgins’s treatment of women but is more likely to really enjoy Eliza shouting “COME ON, DOVER! MOVE YOUR BLOOMIN’ ARSE!” Arse is simply a fantastic word for a female protagonist to shout, and that moment in the film is as joyful to me now as it was 30-odd years ago. On a rewatch as an adult, it’s clear Higgins has contempt for all women, except, maybe, his mother. He is awful to Eliza and not much better to his housekeeper, Mrs Pearce. He sets out to dehumanise Eliza by calling her a “presumptuous insect” or a “draggle-tailed guttersnipe”. His treatment of her is horrendous, but the writer in me can’t help but enjoy his choice of words. It feels like the very definition of a guilty pleasure, to listen to a tirade of sexist insults that includes language such as: “You squashed cabbage leaf, you disgrace to the noble architecture of these columns, you incarnate insult to the English language.” You dislike him for how he treats her but he’s hugely entertaining as a wordsmith, and when he expresses himself through song, thanks to Rex Harrison’s performance you like him even more. You want Eliza to succeed and to win, but I found myself also wanting Higgins and Colonel Pickering to go off into the sunset holding hands. The song Why Can’t a Woman Be More Like a Man? seems to me to emphasise that Pickering might be the perfect partner for Higgins, rather than that Eliza is not right for him, and you want them to live in a world where they could openly explore that. As for the show’s conclusion, it would be satisfying if Higgins met with a grizzly end, as described in the revenge song Just You Wait. I don’t think modern audiences would want Eliza to end up with any of the male characters. You want a man for her who has the intellect of Higgins but the heart of her younger love interest, Freddy. Freddy has one of the best numbers – The Street Where You Live – but you can understand why it’s a no from Eliza, because not even a cracking song can save you when you have the personality of a dishcloth. I think the future that modern audiences would want for Eliza would be for her to keep kicking her way through those class barriers and go it alone; she’s ready for it. My Fair Lady is from an era of musicals that provoke valid discussion as to whether or not they should be revived, mostly because they do not conform to modern standards. I don’t think My Fair Lady quite falls into this category. Yes, it has its problematic bits, but I still think there’s good reason to revive it for years to come, and I look forward to finally seeing it on stage this summer.

4/28/2022,"Marise Payne has denounced the “secret” terms of China’s security deal with Solomon Islands, while insisting “no document signed and kept away from public view” would change Australia’s commitment to answering Pacific countries’ needs. The foreign affairs minister said the agreement was “not transparent” – unlike Australia’s existing security treaty with Solomon Islands – and was also being hidden from other Pacific countries. As the Coalition continues to reject Labor’s claims it presided over the worst Australian foreign policy failure in the Pacific in decades, Payne said other members of the “Pacific family” shared Australia’s concerns about the secretive arrangement. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has relied on the public promises of his counterpart, Manasseh Sogavare, that Solomon Islands would not allow a Chinese military base or a persistent military presence. But Payne revealed on Thursday Australia had “continued to seek assurances on that and we will be doing so into the future”. Payne made the remarks during a significant pre-election foreign policy address, during which she warned “we’ve entered a period that is becoming more dangerous, less stable and less prosperous”. She called for “rules over anarchy” and argued the Coalition’s hard line against Beijing’s “growing assertiveness” had been vindicated. “We have led on this,” Payne said at a United States Studies Centre event in Sydney. “There is now strong agreement from amongst the Australian people that standing firm on our values and principles, even in the face of pressure, is the right approach for our long-term future.” In a reference to China, Payne said “a region in which an authoritarian power is dominant doesn’t get us closer” to Australia’s goal of a freer, more open Indo-Pacific. But China’s signing of the security agreement with Solomon Islands, 1,600km from Cairns, has complicated the Coalition’s push to project a strong message on national security before the 21 May election. On Thursday a key adviser to the premier of the most populous province in Solomon Islands also expressed concern that the deal could enable Sogavare to use Chinese armed police and military personnel to quash democratic dissent and hold power for years to come. Payne implicitly rejected claims Australia had “dropped the ball” in the region. Australia had been dealing with security developments “consistently for some time”, including discussions about China’s desire to establish a security presence in the region, she said. Those conversations had enabled Australia to “even more readily” deploy Australian federal police and Australian defence force personnel in response to unrest in Honiara in November and December, together with New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. “It’s important to acknowledge that that is a Pacific family security response that worked, that was immediate, that addressed the needs of the Solomon Islands,” Payne said. But she said “ultimately a security arrangement kept secret at the insistence of a partner is what we are dealing with now”. Payne acknowledged that Solomon Islands had made a sovereign decision but added: “We know other members of the Pacific family share our concerns.” When asked late on Wednesday whether Beijing planned to disclose the whole treaty, a Chinese foreign ministry official said the two countries would “act in accordance with international customary practice on the basis of bilateral consultation”. The official, Wang Wenbin, said “some Australian politicians” were “seeking their own political gains by making denigrating remarks against China”. He accused the US and Australia of “pure double standards”. “The US shows no openness and transparency when it conducted nuclear tests and dumped nuclear wastes in the South Pacific region and when Aukus opened the Pandora’s box of nuclear proliferation in the Asia Pacific region,” Wang said. Labor’s home affairs spokesperson, Kristina Keneally, echoed Payne’s concerns about the secrecy surrounding the deal. “We have already now got China dictating terms to a member of our Pacific family,” Keneally told reporters in Sydney. Keneally continued to prosecute the argument Morrison “has been caught asleep at the wheel and as a result Australia is less secure”. She cited “extraordinary” remarks from the head of Australia’s Office of National Intelligence, Andrew Shearer, denying that the deal reflected an intelligence failure. “That means it was a government failure,” Keneally said. Keneally accused Karen Andrews of indulging in “conspiratorial fantasies and unhinged commentary about foreign interference” after the home affairs minister implied on Wednesday China might have timed the announcement to influence the Australian election outcome. Keneally said Andrews had yet to reply after she wrote to the minister on Wednesday reminding her of “the vital convention that opposition is briefed on any developing matters of national security” during the election campaign. Andrews has not responded to Guardian Australia’s questions about the matter.",News/World news,Australia’s foreign minister denounces China’s ‘secret’ security deal with Solomon Islands,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/australias-foreign-minister-denounces-chinas-secret-security-deal-with-solomon-islands
4/28/2022,"Prime minister Scott Morrison is doing the surfers’ shaka sign, otherwise known as the “hang loose” gesture; Australians who grew up in the 80s are more likely to remember it from the Network 10 show Ridgey Didge. Yes, it’s the PM in Hawaii. Disconcertingly, ash starts to float across the scene as a male voiceover says: “Going to Hawaii when half the country was burning was a mistake”. The Labor attack ad is made for social media and television and deploys that most useful Morrison line: “I don’t hold a hose, mate.” It mainly comprises various news reports, cobbled together. Today we're launching Labor's new ad campaign.No more mistakes. No more excuses. No more Morrison. pic.twitter.com/IIYFIGmVcm Labor leader Anthony Albanese doesn’t feature in it. It’s a blunt instrument, hammering Morrison over the delays in delivering vaccines and rapid antigen tests. The 30-second video ends with various clips of Morrison saying “that’s not my job”. After an initial prime ministerial-style advertisement focused on Albanese, Labor’s attack ads have come thick and fast. The party’s Facebook page is a blend of videos that rely on terrifying all-caps claims about how the Coalition will ruin your life and Simpsons-style memes, contrasted with leader Anthony Albanese looking … determined. Dr Andrew Hughes, a political marketing lecturer from the Australian National University, says it’s a “smart move” to leave Albanese out of the attacks. “They’re trying to protect his reputation and his brand,” he says. “Minimising damage to him by not linking to him directly is a smart move.” It can backfire when individuals attack other individuals, he says – with a notable exception. Hughes says he’s surprised Labor didn’t kick off with footage of the Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells standing up in parliament after the budget was delivered. Her blistering attack included calling Morrison an autocrat and a bully, and her claims about his actions during his own preselection in 2007 were dominating headlines for weeks. Dr Chris Wallace, a researcher at the University of Canberra who is also the author of How to Win an Election, also reckons Labor could have gone harder. “A good ad as far as it goes,” she says. “But [it] taps, rather than hits, hot-button memories Australian voters have of Scott Morrison’s laggardness, laziness and misfires on the bushfire disaster, vaccine ‘strollout’ and general reluctance to take responsibility. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “This is pretty typical of Labor’s ad approach, expecting gentle reminders of the facts of Morrison’s prime ministership to translate into a reasoned decision by voters to go Labor.” Wallace says Labor should take inspiration from the Lincoln Project, which ran high-profile and successful advertisements against Donald Trump while he was US president. “A skilled director needs to take the needle to this ad and inject a massive dose of emotion into the production and delivery of the content,” she says. “These are dramatic, traumatic memories for Australians – but where’s the drama in the ads?” Hughes says any attack ad, anything controversial, draws people’s attention – even if they don’t hold it for long. “They have to move people really quickly,” Hughes says. “They have just three weeks now so they’re aggressive, they don’t hold back, from the start of the ad to the last second.” He also points out that “ultra-negatives” ads usually use male voices, while female voices are used in less aggressive ones. The only other person whose face features in the Labor advertisement (apart from the guy in the Hawaii snap) is a Cobargo firefighter who refused to shake the PM’s hand. “They’re trying to show that Morrison’s out of touch and he’s not liked. That he can’t connect with normal people in the street,” Hughes says. “That image works really well. “I still think they should have started with Fierravanti-Wells.” Seen an election campaign ad you think we should take a look at?

4/28/2022,"The EU’s border agency has been involved in the pushbacks of at least 957 asylum seekers in the Aegean Sea between March 2020 and September 2021, according to a new investigation. Frontex, the EU’s best-funded agency with a budget of €758m, is being investigated over previous allegations of complicity with Greek authorities in illegal pushbacks of asylum seekers, something the organisation has denied. Now a joint investigation by Lighthouse Reports, Der Spiegel, SRF Rundschau, Republik and Le Monde has revealed Frontex’s involvement in what appear to be pushbacks, according to its own database. According to the joint investigation, a freedom of information request (FoI) found the agency’s internal incident report database, called Jora, recorded sightings of asylum seeker pushbacks in the Aegean being labelled by officials as “prevention of departure”. The Frontex guidelines define this as an incident when migrants are stopped at sea by non-European country authorities in their territorial waters and sent back to their point of departure. Frontex provided a redacted version of the database but included descriptions of 145 cases labelled “prevention of departure”, which differed from reports of the same incidents by the Turkish coastguard, witnesses, leaked documents and other confidential sources, when cross-referenced. In at least 22 incidents, asylum seekers were taken off dinghies, put into Greek life rafts and left adrift at sea. On 28 May last year, a group of almost 50 asylum seekers who had already landed on the Greek island of Lesbos contacted the Norwegian NGO, Aegean Boat Report, sending photos and a WhatsApp message showing their location near the island’s capital, Mytilene. Hours later, some of the group were found by the Turkish coastguard at sea in orange life rafts. This case was later recorded in the Frontex database as a “prevention of departure”. Two Frontex sources claimed to reporters that illegal pushbacks in the Aegean end up in the Jora database as “prevention of departure”. “Why don’t they just call it ‘pushbacks’ and get it over with?” said a Greek coastguard officer. Human rights groups have called pushbacks in the Aegean “systematic”. The fresh allegations against Frontex come before a 15 May referendum in Switzerland on the country’s involvement with the EU border agency. In 2021, Switzerland donated 24m Swiss francs (CHF) to the agency and the government plans to increase this donation to 61m Swiss francs by 2027. But opponents of the agency’s expansion say it would make Switzerland directly responsible for human rights violations taking place on Europe’s borders. The referendum was called after a petition collected more than 62,000 signatures in support of cutting funding for the agency. Greece and Frontex deny allegations of pushbacks and say their officials comply with human rights legislation, but there has been mounting pressure on Frontex executive director Fabrice Leggeri, and the EU has frozen part of its budget while allegations are investigated. Tineke Strik, the Dutch MEP and a member of the Frontex Scrutiny Working Group, called for a suspension of the border agency’s operations in Greece. “A fundamental change in the culture” of the EU border agency was needed, she said, including a change of leadership, because Leggeri has “lost credibility in taking fundamental rights seriously”. “[Frontex] should suspend operations in Greece,” Strik said. “We have so many credible reports from authorities such as the UN and the European Council, which all say that pushbacks are systematic. More needs to be done, otherwise you become part of the violations and complicit – and this is the problem that Frontex is facing.” Frontex said it had no power to investigate the actions of individual countries and that it “ensures and promotes the respect of fundamental rights in all its border management activities”. The agency said it was “fully committed to uphold the highest standards of border control within our operations and our officers are bound by a code of conduct. This is the standard we bring to every one of our operations.” In a statement, the agency added: “Fundamental rights, including the respect for the principle of non-refoulement, are at the core of all the agency’s activities.” Non-refoulement is the fundamental principle underpinning international refugee law: a person requiring protection cannot be forcibly returned to a place where they will face harm.
