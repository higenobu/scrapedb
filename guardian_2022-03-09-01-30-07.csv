3/9/2022,"This twisty-turny thriller from South Korea is an impressive, auspicious debut for writer-director Kwon Oh-Seung; taut as a piano-wire garotte, it’s compelling as a genre exercise. But it also offers a (possibly accidental) critique of a culture that often treats women and disabled people as inferior to able-bodied men. That latter point is extremely well illustrated late in Midnight when heroine Kyung Mi (Jin Ki-joo), a young deaf woman, keeps trying to get help from the cops or onlookers in a crowded street only to find people usually inclined to believe her pursuer, serial killer Do Shik (Wi Ha-Joon, best known as the handsome cop from Squid Game, magnificent here as a baddie) because he’s such a good actor, skilled at implying she’s “hysterical” or “damaged”. Unlucky Kyung Mi just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when she interrupted Do Shik while he was in the process of attacking another young woman, So Jung (Kim Hye-Yoon), whose incredibly controlling brother Tak So (Park Hoon) warned her not to stay out too late. Annoyingly, it turns out he was sort of right. At least it’s the women who show mettle, resourcefulness and compassion, and that also goes for Kyung Mi’s deaf mother (Kil Hae-yeon); the men are largely thugs, dopes or in Do Shik’s case, straight up killers. While Kyung Mi and her mum’s deafness and skill with sign language puts a spin on things, the script doesn’t patronise them by making them more noble or more vulnerable, nor does deafness define their characters. Unsurprisingly, the film uses sound and silence inventively – both to simulate how the world sounds to its deaf characters but also to crank up the tension. That said, Kwon can’t resist over-egging the pudding in the final act with a protracted, borderline-silly finale; but even that excess makes it interesting.

3/9/2022,"Say what you like about Everton, but they don’t get relegated very often, and when they do, they do it in style. In fact, they’ve only been sent down twice. In 1930, a mere two years after Dixie Dean’s 60-goal title-winning season, the Ev were relegated despite winning four of their last five games. They drew the other one, 3-3 at Manchester United, having been 3-1 to the good, dropping a point that would have kept them up. Then in 1951, their fate was sealed on the final day in a 6-0 humiliation at Sheffield Wednesday. “To abuse Everton at this stage,” wrote Donny Davies in Big Paper, “would be too much like picking up a person badly mauled from a street accident and reading him a lecture on the folly of jay-walking.” Talk about slyly putting the boot in. A drop-kicking, if you will. Whether the current iteration of the Ev are quite as hopeless as those particular forefathers is a moot point, though Monday night’s 5-0 hammering at Tottenham doesn’t exactly help. It’s true that games between the two clubs are rarely predictable: Everton have won 5-4 and lost 6-2 at Goodison in recent years, while Tottenham’s all-time highest goal haul in the league came in a 10-4 win at White Hart Lane in Bill Nicholson’s first game in charge. (“It can only get worse,” a deadpan Danny Blanchflower told the new boss as he ambled off the pitch and down the tunnel, whistling insouciantly.) But this collapse has come at the worst possible time, with Everton one point above the relegation zone, and what would be only their fifth season out of the top flight since the league began in 1888 now a very real possibility. “I have no problems with the challenge,” insisted Frank Lampard after this latest fiasco. That statement might not survive full scrutiny, given Everton have lost four of the seven games played since he took over, and in two of the other three, his team could only manage five goals in 180 minutes against non-league Boreham Wood and a defence given instructions by Marcelo Bielsa. Those early Goodison parties against Leeds and Brentford in the Cup suddenly look less the start of the honeymoon, more a dead cat bounce. That may explain why Lampard went on to blame individual errors over any perceived tactical incompetence. “The first 15 minutes looked like I wanted it to,” he began, his voice barely audible above the sound of running water and freshly soaped hands, “but the crucial part of Tottenham’s game as a counterattacking team is to find space behind you and the players were aware of that and didn’t deal with it.” Lampard went on to bemoan “issues that were there before me and don’t take care of themselves overnight”, which is fair enough until you consider he’s had 37 overnights now to address at least one thing, something, anything, and has only another six to work out a plan for the visit of Wolves that doesn’t involve throwing his players under the bus in the post-match presser.

Anyone taking a foul throw in the Nottsborough FC third team is hit with a mandatory pint-downing fine. If this was introduced in the top flight, refs and fans might be keener to call them out” – Dan Ashley. “If Alan hadn’t already switched off Forest v Huddersfield last night due to the amount of corners clearly being taken from outside of the quadrant, I dread to think what action he took upon viewing Pipa’s injury-time throw-in” – Jim Hearson. “Many people have mentioned their favourite tea-time email being shortened (Fiver letters passim).

3/9/2022,"Nine-time NBA All-Star Russell Westbrook has spoken out after his wife, Nina, said she has received “death wishes” as the Los Angeles Lakers’ struggles continue. The 33-year-old Westbrook, who joined his hometown Lakers in August, has become a focal point for fans’ ire as the 2020 NBA champions struggle to make the playoffs this season. “I 100% stand behind my wife and how she’s feeling,” Westbrook said after the Lakers lost to the San Antonio Spurs on Monday, their eighth defeat in 10 games. “When it comes to basketball, I don’t mind the criticism of missing and making shots. But the moment it becomes where my name is getting shamed, it becomes an issue. “I’ve kind of let it go in the past because it never really bothered me. But it really kind of hit me the other day. Me and my wife were at teacher-parent conferences for my son. And the teacher told me, ‘[Westbrook’s son] Noah, he’s so proud of his last name. He writes it everywhere. He writes it on everything. He tells everybody and walks around and says, ‘I’m Westbrook.’ ... And I kind of sat there in shock, and it hit me, like, ‘Damn. I can no longer allow people [to denigrate my surname].’” Westbrook has been nicknamed “Westbrick” by some Lakers fans for his perceived poor shooting. The 2017 NBA MVP said the insults meant his family no longer wanted to attend Lakers games in person. “It affects them even going to games,” he said. “Like, I don’t even want to bring my kids to the game because I don’t want them to hear people calling their dad nicknames and other names for no reason because he’s playing the game that he loves. And it’s gotten so bad where my family don’t even want to go to home games, to any game ... and it’s just super unfortunate, man. And it’s super upsetting to me. “I’m at a point where I’m going to continue to address it. It’s just unfortunate.” The Lakers started the season as favorites to win the NBA title after adding veterans such as Carmelo Anthony and Westbrook to a roster than includes LeBron James and Anthony Davis. However they have struggled mightily, particularly in recent months, and are now 11.5 games behind the Denver Nuggets, who occupy the final automatic qualifying place for the playoffs. If the season ended today, the Lakers would be forced into a play-in tournament to qualify for the first-round of the playoffs.",Sport/Sport,Russell Westbrook hits back after wife receives ‘death wishes’ as Lakers struggle,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/08/russell-westbrook-hits-back-after-wife-receives-death-wishes-as-lakers-struggle
