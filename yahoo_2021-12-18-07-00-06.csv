12/18/2021,"A dog with a monstrous deformity atop its head is getting a second chance at life after one Louisiana community rallied to provide a surgical makeover. The “swelling mass” was removed in a procedure done at the Louisiana State University School of Veterinary Medicine, according to Jefferson Protection & Animal Welfare Services. The parish is just south of New Orleans. Before and after photos shared on Facebook this month show the canine is now doggedly cute, despite a large row of stitches between its ears. The shelter staff named her Presley, though some in the community took to calling her Anabelle. “We can confirm that the growth on her head was not cancer and she should recover beautifully,” the department wrote Dec. 16. “Presley has a long road of healing ahead of her, but she has shown us all that she has the spirit of a fighter. Don’t the best fighters have the largest fan base? Well, with OUR community backing her, she will no doubt continue to heal and recover.” The cause of the mass was not revealed. Photos of the strange growth were first posted Dec. 2 on Facebook, when shelter officials reported Presley was caught wandering along railroad tracks in the Avondale area of Jefferson Parish. She was “immediately” seen by a veterinarian, who discovered the dog also had a fractured leg. The post ignited offers of financial aid from the community, with some calling the photo “pretty upsetting.” “Oh my goodness, this is just heartbreaking,” Tim Allen wrote. “It’s just unbelievable,” Jamie Smith Scaffidi posted. The surgery at LSU also included placing pins in the dog’s back legs, which means physical therapy will be needed to help Presley walk again, officials said. Further leg surgery will also be done, but shelter officials said that can wait until she is stronger. Costs are being covered in part by the nonprofit Drew Pet Foundation, officials said.

12/18/2021,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Leading California cannabis companies warned Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday that the state’s legal industry was on the verge of collapse and needed immediate tax cuts and a rapid expansion of retail outlets to steady the shaky marketplace. The letter signed by more than two dozen executives, industry officials and legalization advocates followed years of complaints that the heavily taxed and regulated industry was unable to compete with the widespread illegal economy, where consumer prices are far lower and sales are double or triple the legal business. Four years after broad legal sales began, “our industry is collapsing,” said the letter, which also was sent to legislative leaders in Sacramento. The industry leaders asked for an immediate lifting of the cultivation tax placed on growers, a three-year holiday from the excise tax and an expansion of retail shops throughout much of the state. It’s estimated that about two-thirds of California cities remain without dispensaries, since it's up to local governments to authorize sales and production. The current system “is rigged for all to fail,” they wrote. “The opportunity to create a robust legal market has been squandered as a result of excessive taxation,” the letter said. “Seventy-five percent of cannabis in California is consumed in the illicit market and is untested and unsafe.” “We need you to understand that we have been pushed to a breaking point,” they told the governor. Newsom spokeswoman Erin Mellon said in a statement that the governor supports cannabis tax reform and recognizes the system needs change, while expanding enforcement against illegal sales and production. “It’s clear that the current tax construct is presenting unintended but serious challenges. Any tax-reform effort in this space will require action from two-thirds of the Legislature and the Governor is open to working with them on a solution,” Mellon said. Companies, executives and groups signing the letter included the California Cannabis Industry Association, the California arm of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, the Los Angeles-based United Cannabis Business Association, Flow Kana Inc., Harborside Inc., and CannaCraft. In a conference call with reporters, Darren Story of Strong Agronomy said tough market conditions forced him to cut loose more than half his staff. He said taxes that will increase next year make it an easy choice for shoppers. With prices in the underground half of what they see on legal shelves, he said “most consumers are going to take off.” The companies asked Newsom to include their proposals in his upcoming budget proposal, which will be released early next year.
