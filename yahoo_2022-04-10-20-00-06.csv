4/10/2022,"By Jan Lopatka PRAGUE (Reuters) -The Czech Republic has delivered tanks, multiple rocket launchers, howitzers and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine among military shipments that have reached hundreds of millions of dollars and will continue, two Czech defence sources said. Ukraine has repeatedly called on the West to urgently supply more weapons, especially heavy equipment, as Russian forces regroup in the country's east for a new offensive after withdrawing from around the capital Kyiv and other regions. NATO members are providing a wide range of weapon systems to the country, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday. The Czech Republic - a former Soviet satellite as part of then Czechoslovakia - has spare equipment that Ukrainian forces are familiar with in storage as well as a defence industry focused on upgrades and trade in such weapons. It has been among the most active EU nations in backing Ukraine. Defence sources confirmed to Reuters a shipment of five T-72 tanks and five BVP-1, or BMP-1, infantry fighting vehicles seen on rail cars in photographs on Twitter and video footage this week, but those were not the first shipments of heavy equipment. ""For several weeks, we have been supplying heavy ground equipment - I am saying it generally but by definition it is clear that this includes tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, howitzers and multiple rocket launchers,"" a senior defence official said. ""What has gone from the Czech Republic is in the hundreds of millions of dollars."" The sources declined to discuss numbers of weapons supplied. The senior defence official said the Czechs were also supplying a range of anti-aircraft weaponry. Independent defence analyst Lukas Visingr said short-range air-defence systems Strela-10, or SA-13 Gopher in NATO terminology, have been spotted on a train apparently bound for Ukraine, in line with a report in Czech weekly respekt.cz. The Defence Ministry declined to comment on concrete military aid. Reuters has asked the Ukrainian government for comment although it normally declines to give information on weapons shipments. One agreed shipment publicised by the German government includes 56 Czechoslovak-made infantry fighting vehicles that used to be operated by East Germany and by Sweden. They were later sold to Czech arms firm EXCALIBUR ARMY, part of industrial and defence holding CZECHOSLOVAK GROUP that is instrumental in the Czech supplies to Ukraine. The company declined to comment on specific shipments. It said its supplies since the war started included heavy equipment. FUNDRAISING FOR WEAPONS The Czech programme to ship weapons includes money raised in public fundraising efforts by the Ukrainian embassy, which has raised $42.31 million as of Friday, the embassy said. It said the effort was unique among aid campaigns by Ukrainian embassies in its sole focus on buying weapons in cooperation with local authorities, and that $31.18 million had been used. It declined to comment on the weapons purchased. Funding also comes in the form of Czech government gifts of army equipment and ammunition - worth over $44.51 million to date, according to the Defence Ministry - and from Ukrainian and other governments, the defence official said without giving further details. Sourcing, of both light and heavy weapons, is done from army stockpiles and through Czech defence companies and their network of contacts in other countries, the sources said. Visingr said the Czech army had possibly around 60 tanks and a three-digit number of fighting vehicles and CZECHOSLOVAK GROUP had even more pieces of heavy equipment in storage that could be potentially supplied to Ukraine. The fact that a lot of the equipment has not been modernised is a plus for Ukraine due to time constraints, he said. ""That is a benefit, not a deficiency. These are things the Ukrainians know perfectly."" The Czech Republic has also been in talks with Ukraine about repairing damaged Ukrainian equipment. The defence source said this could be equipment in Ukrainian storage that needed repairs, or equipment damaged in fighting. Czech repair companies were being consulted about their possibilities, the source said.

4/10/2022,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — A 16-year-old high school student has been jailed in Las Vegas and will be prosecuted as an adult on sex assault and attempted murder charges following an after-school attack on a teacher, authorities said Friday. Las Vegas police said the female teacher was punched and choked into unconsciousness and the student fled the Eldorado High School campus before another school employee found the teacher and summoned police and medical help. The woman was treated for multiple injuries, police said. The student was arrested by school police several blocks from the campus that serves about 2,000 students several miles east of downtown Las Vegas. His name and the name of the teacher were not immediately made public. On Friday, school administrators issued a statement to parents calling the attack “an isolated incident,” and Clark County School District Superintendent Jesus Jara sent a message to employees calling safety “our top priority.” “I am devastated, and the CCSD family hurts for the teacher assaulted at Eldorado High School,” Jara’s message said. “Our hearts are heavy because of the violence committed against her, and we pray for her full recovery.” But the violence was only the latest for the sprawling district, the nation’s fifth-largest with more than 300,000 students and more than 18,000 teachers at about 336 schools — including more than 70 high schools — in an area the size of New Jersey. The district began a weeklong spring break after classes were dismissed on Friday. On Wednesday, a 17-year-old boy was arrested after a loaded gun was found on the floor of a school bathroom at a northwest Las Vegas high school. On March 29, a campus police officer fired three gunshots at a moving car that had struck a girl amid a report of a fight in a parking lot at a downtown Las Vegas high school. Four teenage non-students were in the car. The driver and a passenger received minor wounds, and the girl struck by the car was not seriously hurt. A day earlier, a 36-year-old mother was arrested near a Henderson high school and accused of trying to kill two schoolgirls by driving her vehicle into them to prevent them from fighting her daughter after an on-campus dispute. Police said the injured girls had broken bones but were expected to recover. In early March, 11 people were arrested, including an adult who allegedly entered a southwest Las Vegas high school campus during several days of student fights, social media threats, classroom lockdowns and an unproved report of a gun. In February, video posted to the internet showed a female high school student attacking a girl who was seated at a desk, pummeling her with about 35 punches to the back and side of her head. Jara, who was abruptly fired by the school board in October and reinstated about three weeks later with no public explanation, issued a recent public plea for an end to violence. He blamed it on ""the stress, anxieties and isolation of the (coronavirus) pandemic.” Since schools began in August, campus police have reported 3,000 assaults and fights, and confiscated more than 25 guns, the school district police chief said. “As I have said previously,” Jara said in his message on Friday, “violent acts, assaults, and bullying will not be tolerated ... and those who choose to engage in these activities will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” School police Lt. Bryan Zink said the teen arrested after Thursday’s attack was taken to the Clark County jail and would face charges as an adult. Las Vegas police said he was booked on attempted murder, sexual assault, battery, kidnapping and robbery charges. It was not immediately clear when the teen would face a judge or if he had an attorney. The charges against him could put him in prison for the rest of his life. Las Vegas police said in a statement that investigators determined he entered the teacher’s classroom “to talk about his grades.” “At some point, the (student) got violent and began punching the (teacher) and strangled her until she lost consciousness,” the statement said.",U.S./Associated Press,Teen in troubled district accused of teacher murder attempt,https://news.yahoo.com/teen-troubled-district-accused-teacher-234914132.html
