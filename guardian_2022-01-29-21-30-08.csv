1/29/2022,"African art music – a bridge between western classical forms and traditional melody and rhythm – has a determined champion in the Romanian-Nigerian pianist Rebeca Omordia. She has made her life’s work a quest to discover and perform the output of composers – often unpublished – from right across that great continent. Judging by her inaugural recital in this year’s African Concert Series, her determination is yielding fascinating results. Imagine, if you can, a sensuous, serpentine Arabic melody in the left hand winding its way up towards a delicate filigree of sparkling stars in the right hand and you have something of the impression that Moroccan composer Nabil Benabdeljalil (b.1972) creates in his beautiful Nocturne No 4 from 2015. His romantic Nocturne No 6 from 2020, which expresses his intense joy at roaming the Middle Atlas mountains after lockdown, feels as though John Field himself might have been a ghostly presence at his side.  Christian Onyeji (b.1967) seeks to transfer Nigerian drumming techniques to the piano in his Ufie, Igbo Dance, which becomes a wild celebration of intense rhythm, captured dramatically by Omordia. His piece neatly mirrored the ideas of Akin Euba (1935-2020), who promoted interculturalism in composition and saw pianism as a means to express features of Nigerian traditional music. Euba’s Ore Meta uses percussion – performed here by Abdelkader Saadoun – to drive his sophisticated arrangement of a popular song from the Yoruba region. David Earl (b.1951) grew up in Stellenbosch. Princess Rainbow, from his Scenes from a South African Childhood, shimmers with a lyrical nostalgia as he recalls fishing on the river alongside his father.

1/29/2022,"The inquiry into Downing Street parties could be shared with Boris Johnson as soon as this weekend as cross-party demands mount for the report to be published in its entirety after an intervention by Scotland Yard. The timeline for the publication of the long-awaited report by the senior civil servant Sue Gray on alleged lockdown breaches at Downing Street and Whitehall was thrown into question this week when the Metropolitan police announced on Tuesday that a criminal investigation had been launched.  Scotland Yard provoked outrage by demanding that references to matters it was examining be removed from the report. MPs labelled the force, which is investigating possible breaches punishable by fixed-penalty notices, “a broken organisation”. The Met’s intervention has been met with a torrent of criticism, with Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party calling for full transparency over the Gray report. Sir Christopher Chope, the Conservative MP for Christchurch, on Saturday became the latest figure to join demands for the report’s publication, accusing the Met of an “abuse of power”. Government sources said on Friday night that Gray’s team had decided to send a redacted version of the report to No 10. There were also new claims late on Friday that the prime minister’s wife, Carrie Johnson, allegedly sent messages to No 10 staff offering to bring a cake to a June 2020 gathering. The Telegraph reported that the inquiry was told she asked a government official to gather staff together to celebrate the prime minister’s 56th birthday, adding that she would organise the cake. Chope told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Saturday: “I don’t think it’s any of their business. This is a Cabinet Office inquiry and the findings have been concluded, and they’ve been shared – I don’t know why – with the Metropolitan police. Now the Metropolitan police seem to be interfering both in the content of the report and trying to prevent it being published in an unredacted form.” He said matters would have been different if criminal charges had been imminent, in which case the matter would have been sub judice and barred from discussion in the Commons. “Under the rules of law which apply in our country, this is not sub judice … that’s why I think this is an abuse of power by the Metropolitan police,” he said. Adam Holloway, the Tory MP for Gravesham, also called for Gray’s report to be published in its entirety. “The fact is we’re not getting a full and rounded view from what we’re getting from the media, and that’s why I – and probably Boris too – would like to see the whole of Sue Gray’s report, and as soon as possible, so we can end this madness,” he said. Holloway defended Johnson, describing him as “a really remarkable guy who got an 80-seat majority”. He said he “believed him when he said he didn’t know it was a party”. Commander Catherine Roper, the head of the Met’s central specialist crime command, said the timing of the document’s release was up to the Cabinet Office. She defended the force’s request for Gray to limit her report, saying it was a means of protecting “the integrity of the police investigation” in order to be “as fair as possible to those who are subject to it”.",News/Politics,PM awaits Sue Gray report as Tory MP claims Met is ‘abusing power’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/29/boris-johnson-could-receive-sue-gray-report-this-weekend
1/29/2022,"There is an old story about Fabien Galthié that is worth telling again now, a week out from the start of the Six Nations. It is from 2003, when France’s head coach was captaining the team in the World Cup. It was his fourth, he had been in teams that lost in the quarters in 1991, the semis in ’95, and final in ’99. Understandably, he was hell-bent on finishing his career by winning the thing. But France were beaten in the semi-finals again, 24-7 by England. That left them one game to play, the third-place play-off against New Zealand four days later. By the time it came around, Galthié had already gone. He was fit but had quit and flown back to France.  Galthié said it was because his uncle had just died, but he had already announced he was retiring right after the semi-final when he admitted in private he wasn’t interested in playing the last game. There were plenty of people who thought Galthié, famously driven and furiously intense, had walked out on the team because he was so utterly focused on winning that he felt like it was first or nothing. It was held against him when he was repeatedly overlooked for the job of national coach, which he wanted so much and went instead to Marc Lièvremont, Philippe Saint-André, Guy Novès and then Jacques Brunel. Some of those appointments look even worse now, given how well France have played since Galthié finally did take over in 2019. He and his crack band of assistant coaches, Shaun Edwards, William Servat and Thibault Giroud, have had a transformative effect on the team. They have shepherded the best of the talented young bunch who won back-to-back titles in the World Under-20 Championship into senior rugby, finished runners-up in the Autumn Nations Cup and in two Six Nations, won their first away victory over Australia in 30 years, and, best yet, beat New Zealand by 15 points in Paris last November. All of a sudden, as the Italy coach, Kieran Crowley, says, France are “the team of the moment” and clear favourites to win what is shaping up to be a fiercely competitive Six Nations. After a decade of dysfunction, there is a sense that things are finally starting to come together. The prospect of hosting the World Cup in 2023 has got the French Federation, run by Galthié’s old coach and great mate Bernard Laporte, and the Top 14 clubs pulling together in the same sort of direction. Which is why Galthié might just be beginning to feel a little twitch of that old anger of his because he, his coaches and players know the one thing they haven’t done yet is win a championship. Edwards has said as much, more than once. “We’re kind of everyone’s second-favourite team at the moment aren’t we?” he said recently. “We’ve got a bit of respect, but we haven’t won anything yet. That’s the next step, and it’s often the hardest one.” And they need to make it soon. Not just because it’s been so long – the French haven’t won the Six Nations since 2010 – but because the World Cup is so close. It’s a young squad buoyed by the sense of expectation, but that could switch pretty quickly and begin to feel like a hell of a lot of pressure unless they prove to themselves, and everyone else, that they can win a trophy. Eddie Jones knows. He picked up on it when he was asked about France’s chances. “You know, France are sitting at the top of the tree in the Six Nations, red-hot favourites, expected to win, and if they don’t the French rugby public is going to be disappointed,” Jones said. “They’ve shown what great depth they’ve got, they had a development tour to Australia and the results were amazing. And then they’ve got the luxury of having 43 players in camp, the grand master of French rugby, Bernard Laporte, has done a great job in getting the clubs to work with the French union. So they don’t have any excuses. And all of that comes with a price.” A price, Jones said, which he was sure France’s new captain, Antoine Dupont, “would be able to handle”, even if “he does have a lot on his plate already”. Which might just be a typical little bit of mischief-making from a coach who knows France are likely to be one of the biggest obstacles to his England team achieving his own dream of winning the World Cup next year. But it still has a hint of Jones’s thinking in it, of the weaknesses he sees, and how he wants to exploit them. As for Galthié, he is handling it by talking up everyone else. “We’re happy and proud to be considered the team of the moment, but Ireland have been undefeated since February, beat the All Blacks in November, and are ahead of us in the rankings. Scotland have put in some great performances. Wales won last year. England won two years ago. They all have the ability to win this tournament.” France’s tournament has already had a wobbly start, with Dupont and a group of his Toulouse teammates forced to miss the first week of training after testing positive for Covid. Given they begin with a home game against Italy, they’ll cope, but the tournament is still going to be a test of France’s ability to put together a string of performances like they will need to do in 2023. That win against the All Blacks came after four weeks of prep, all focused on that one match, the squad built up to it through games against Argentina and Georgia. Beating Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England back-to-back is going to be a very different sort of test. Not for the first time in Galthié’s life, winning is starting to feel like everything, and anything else isn’t enough.",Sport/Sport,Time has come for Galthié’s France to deliver a trophy | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/29/the-time-has-come-for-fabien-galthies-france-to-deliver-a-trophy
1/29/2022,"Born in Hitchin in 1990, James Bay is a singer-songwriter whose music spans indie-pop, blues-rock and soul. He scored a triple-platinum hit in 2014 with his stadium anthem Hold Back the River, taken from his debut album, Chaos and the Calm, which won the coveted Brits critics’ choice award. The album went straight to No 1 in the UK charts and was followed by the R&B-inspired Electric Light; a third album is due out later this year. Bay is currently playing small-capacity gigs in support of Independent Venue Week; the tour ends on 4 February. A former face of Burberry, he lives in London with his partner, Lucy Smith, and their daughter.  This photo was taken when I was 17 and sitting in Lucy’s halls of residence in Brighton. I was getting into the mood of what the next few years would be: riders full of chips and beer. I’d had long hair since I was 12, so chopping it off was quite an outrageous thing for me to do at the time, especially as it ended up looking a bit like a mullet. It might seem like I was that stereotypical guy at the party with the acoustic guitar, but I wasn’t that naff. I was always playing music, though, or at least always trying. I grew up in a little town called Hitchin in Hertfordshire. Once the proper teenage years kicked in, I started to get bored, so I’d break into supermarket car parks and skateboard all night. In the background was this constant obsession with music. I first picked up a guitar when I was 11; by the time I was 14 I’d discovered Guns N’ Roses and Cream, and was fully fixated. Instead of posters, I’d draw my heroes, like Jimi Hendrix and Slash, and stick them on my bedroom wall. Although I’d get the occasional person shouting “Cut your hair!” at me, I was really tall, which is a bit of a godsend when it comes to avoiding bullying. It was lucky, as I was an introverted teenager. Most of all, I was my brother Alex’s wingman. Along with some other friends, he and I formed a band called Roadrunner and spent our evenings playing pubs or people’s living rooms. The rest of the group looked like Kings of Leon in their bootcuts, old band T-shirts and layered hair. I was more hippy-like: baggy jeans and Converse. I didn’t have the guts to pull off cowboy boots or anything too extravagant. As a result, my brother was the lead singer and I was the one standing behind him. Eventually his confidence rubbed off on me. It was on those trips to see Lucy in Brighton where I discovered the open mic nights in the city. I finally felt as if I could step into the spotlight and do this on my own. At first I felt pressure and anxiety as a solo artist. There was one bleak night in Hitchin where I played to one old man standing 25ft away from me in an empty room. The guy running the venue was not happy: “Where’s the fucking audience, mate? I’m trying to make money on the bar and you’ve not brought anybody except this old bloke who’s here every day.” The tragic experiences made the incredible moments when people did start to turn up even better, though. There was another show in a pub in Hitchin where a crowd of 50 people were losing their minds. The promoter leaned over the speakers and gave me a tenner to do two more songs. So I did. And then he gave me another tenner to do two more songs after that. It was nights like that where I felt like something had shifted. I still knock around with the same gang of friends that I did when I was 15, so they know how to keep me in check. That’s really helpful when your career is first taking off. At the start it was a weird sensation to have people comment on how I looked. I used to wear hats, a style that became my signature look for Chaos and the Calm. The press would focus on my fedora, and so it became central to how I was perceived. So these days I don’t wear one. I’m glad to have kicked the habit. I don’t want to be unoriginal, but I definitely found the threat of the second album overwhelming. I was amazed by the reception of my debut and while it looked like an overnight success, I’d been trying to make it happen since I was 14. It was 10 years of hard work and then it all went very quickly, a really crazy ride. It was that transition from being an innocent creative artist to having this nagging voice in my head – saying, “Can you actually do this again? Your new album better win all the accolades the first one did!” – that made me question what I was doing. The pressure didn’t stop me from having a brilliant time taking it on tour, though. Not that I am very rock’n’roll. I have to take care of myself; my voice won’t work if I’m hungover. Opening for the Rolling Stones at Twickenham Stadium in 2018 was one of the best days of my life. It was also totally illuminating. They’re the most rock’n’roll band in the world, and yet before the show Mick Jagger was backstage doing a full workout with 10 personal trainers. It made me feel all right about all those times I’ve gone back to the hotel alone to get an early night. Looking back at this photo, I see a guy who was passionate and driven, but I had no idea how hungry I’d need to be to stick around. I’ve definitely become more calm and confident, and my hair’s possibly a bit better. Plus there’s no more chips and dips on my rider. Everything is now in recyclable packaging and is as organic and healthy as it can possibly be. No drugs, no Jameson. One nice bottle of wine, at the very wildest. Let’s not overdo it.",Lifestyle/Life and style,James Bay looks back: ‘I’m glad to have kicked the fedora habit’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/29/james-bay-looks-back-im-glad-to-have-kicked-the-fedora-habit
1/29/2022," The Greek star violinist Leonidas Kavakos made his concert debut aged 17, in 1984. Only now has he made his first recording of Bach’s six solo sonatas and partitas, mighty monuments of the violin repertoire, traditionally grouped as Sei Solo (Sony). Kavakos’s sound is intense, silken, mercurial – a modern, characterful performance aware of history, playful in its ornamentation, but without exaggeration. The recording is spacious and resonant. His formidable technique makes light of the effortful cross-string chordal passages – in the Sarabande of the B minor Partita, or in the tugging, anguished opening of the vast Chaconne of the D minor (which he ends with), bringing out voices, structure, line.  There are as many ways to perform this music as there are top violinists: from Rachel Podger, matchless in her understanding of period performance, to those aristocratic players of the past – Arthur Grumiaux, Nathan Milstein. In recent months, James Ehnes, Augustin Hadelich, Tedi Papavrami and Fabio Biondi have issued sets. There’s no best here: many voices, all worth our attention, but Kavakos’s fire and grace take some beating.  The pairing on disc of settings of the Magnificat by JS Bach and his son CPE Bach has precedent but isn’t common, and the comparisons between these two works, both in D major, make fascinating listening. Jonathan Cohen directed his group Arcangelo in these, and a third by another prominent son, JC Bach, in 2018 (Hyperion). Champions of historical performance practice, the excellent Gaechinger Cantorey of Stuttgart and soloists, conducted by Hans-Christoph Rademann (Accentus), do not favour quite the same thrilling propulsion in the JS Bach setting that you might find with either of John Eliot Gardiner’s recordings. The nine-movement CPE Bach Magnificat, however, crackles with punch and purpose, the instrumental writing vigorous, the arias – such as the bass’s Fecit potentiam – virtuosic, the choruses grand, all reminding us of CPE’s genius, which might be more appreciated had he not been the son of that particular father.

1/29/2022,"International travel will receive its biggest boost in two years when the government scraps the need to be Covid tested before and after you arrive back home in England or Scotland – provided you are fully vaccinated or under 18. The rule change, which comes just in time for the half-term break, applies to anyone arriving after 4am on Friday 11 February. Wales and Northern Ireland are yet to change their testing rules, although they are expected to follow.  Under-18s and those who qualify as fully vaccinated (having had the second jab at least 14 days previously) will no longer need to take a Covid test before they depart for home, nor after they arrive back. On the same day, the unvaccinated will no longer be required to self-isolate on arrival but they will still need to take a pre-departure test, and book and pay for a day-two PCR test. The need for the second, day-eight, test is removed. Everyone arriving in the UK will still be required to fill in a passenger locator form. Those heading abroad face a bewildering set of rules – depending on their destination. Most countries now require a vaccination certificate to enter without quarantine and, or, a negative Covid-19 test result taken up to 48 hours before the traveller departs the UK. Some countries require the under-18s to prove they have been vaccinated or that adults have had a booster. In Austria, 16- and 17-year-olds must be fully vaccinated, take a test and have a booster in order to enter. Malta still requires 12- to 18-year-olds to be fully vaccinated before arrival. For this reason, the UK government has announced that children aged 12-15 are to be given access to digital Covid passes in time for half-term. Families can also request a NHS Covid pass letter, which takes about seven working days to arrive. Plenty of people who have had the coronavirus in the previous three months are returning positive results when they take pre-departure PCR tests. Some countries, for example, Morocco, which reopens to tourists on 1 February, currently require a negative PCR test taken up to 48 hours before departure. It is worth considering whether all your party would pass a test before you book an expensive trip. PCR tests will pick up traces of infection up to three months after it ended. Some countries will accept proof of recovery instead of a negative PCR test but not many. It is expected that more countries will relax rules in the coming weeks and months but you may not want to bank upon it.",Lifestyle/Money,Covid tests: travellers from England and Scotland face new rules,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/29/covid-tests-travellers-from-england-and-scotland-face-new-rules
1/29/2022,"The Tory MP Tom Tugendhat has become the first to say he would throw his hat in the ring if there were a Conservative party leadership contest. The MP for Tonbridge and Malling and chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee said it would be a “huge privilege” to serve as prime minister, a job he once described as like winning the lottery.  The former soldier, 48, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, said anyone who would be able to garner support from a group of colleagues should “go for it”, and that it was “up to all of us to put ourselves forward”. The likelihood of Boris Johnson facing an imminent confidence vote over Downing Street parties that allegedly broke lockdown rules has stirred speculation about possible leadership candidates. Tugendhat, a Tory centrist without ministerial experience, is considered a 16-1 outsider to succeed Johnson, but his name is increasingly coming up as a viable option. One former cabinet minister said: “Tom would be my first choice.” Tugendhat told Times Radio: “I think I’m making it pretty clear that I think that it’s up to all of us to put ourselves forward. And it’s up to the electorate, in the first case parliamentary colleagues, and in the second case the party, to choose.” He said he had not been canvassing support, but “of course you should have a go”. “I think it’s a position of absolute integrity to say that of course you should offer yourself to the electorate if you think you can do it. Of course you should talk to colleagues and see if you can get a group together, and if you can get a group together you should go for it,” he said. Pressed on whether he would still like to be PM after expressing an interest in the past, he said: “It would be a huge privilege. It’s one of those questions that I know many people ask and some people, some of my colleagues are coy about and I don’t understand why. “I don’t think you should be embarrassed to want to serve your country. I was very proud to serve my country in the armed forces and I got to the highest rank I could so that I could have the best effect that I could. And I was very proud to serve as a diplomat around the world.” Tugendhat has an important ally in Michael Gove, the levelling-up secretary, but he is less popular on the party’s right. The chief whip, Mark Spencer, has reportedly nicknamed him “Tom Tugendtwat”. He supported the remain campaign, but his loyal voting record on Brexit matters under Theresa May and Johnson and his opposition to stricter Covid measures could net him some support from rightwingers. Whether Tugendhat would end up as “the Rory Stewart of the race”, as one MP put it – a reference to the former development secretary’s failed leadership bid in 2019 – his motivation seems to be shatterproof. He told Politics Home: “I will serve at whatever level I’m asked to.” ",News/Politics,Tory MP Tom Tugendhat becomes first to throw hat into leadership ring,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/29/tory-mp-tom-tugendhat-becomes-first-to-throw-hat-into-leadership-ring-boris-johnson
1/29/2022,"West Ham’s hopes of strengthening their attacking options have suffered another blow after Leeds turned down a bid for Raphinha. David Moyes wants to add more depth to his squad before the transfer window shuts on Monday night and has funds available as he tries to boost his side’s hopes of qualifying for the Champions League. West Ham have spent the month hunting for a forward and had set their sights on Raphinha, who is enjoying an impressive season at Leeds.  It is thought that West Ham were prepared to pay a club-record fee for the Brazilian winger, who produced a dazzling display when Leeds beat Moyes’s side two weeks ago. However their attempts to sign Raphinha were knocked back, with Marcelo Bielsa adamant that the 25-year-old will not leave Elland Road this month, and it remains to be seen if the east Londoners return with a higher offer. West Ham, who are in fifth, are under pressure to sign an attacking player. Michail Antonio is the only recognised centre-forward in their squad and has looked tired at times this season. Antonio needs more support and while Raphinha usually plays on the right, Moyes thinks the Brazil international can play a number of roles. Moyes believes Raphinha can play in the same team as Jarrod Bowen, who plays on the right for West Ham. West Ham also made an inquiry about Bayer Leverkusen’s Patrik Schick this month, but were told the Czech Republic forward is not for sale. The east London club have also looked at Blackburn’s Ben Brereton Díaz and Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who is unlikely to leave Goodison Park this month. Moyes also wants a centre-back and has targeted Marseille’s Duje Caleta-Car. However, West Ham would prefer to sign the Croatia defender on loan, with Marseille after a permanent sale.",Sport/Football,West Ham struggling to boost attack after Leeds reject Raphinha bid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/29/west-ham-leeds-reject-raphinha-bid
1/29/2022,"It is a chilly Tuesday evening at Fairfax Park, home to Bridgwater United, and in the modest main stand it is out with the old and in with the new. A volunteer, Richard Gudge, is replacing 150 red and black seats as preparations to play host to Manchester United in front of a record crowd continue. The Women’s FA Cup shimmers on a plinth before camera crews and huddling children keen to take a closer look. These are snapshots that epitomise a community bursting with pride. “I’ve taken the week off work to be here to help,” says Gudge, a decorator whose daughter, Freya, plays for the under-21s.  On Sunday, when Bridgwater welcome the Women’s Super League side to Somerset in the fourth round, Gudge will be selling hats, scarves and programmes in the club shop. It is impossible to escape the sense that a significant occasion is on the horizon. There is a tangible buzz, nervous energy flowing through everybody from the coaching staff to the squad, who are midway through a double training session, and the caterers, who have ordered a quarter of a tonne of chips to feed a capacity crowd of 2,500. Among the fans will likely be Grace Best, sister of the Manchester United legend George, who is related to a player on the fringe of the first team. The club’s previous record attendance was 1,112, for a men’s derby against Taunton Town in 1997. Sunday’s tickets for the main stand sold out in 10 minutes. In contrast to the men’s competition, home teams keep 100% of gate receipts. Such is the level of interest the chairman, Bob Buckingham, believes they could have sold another 1,000 but, unlike when they entertained Milton Keynes Dons this month in front of a crowd of 146, there will be no room for walk-ups. “It is great to hear the community talking about the game and talking about us as a club, which is fantastic because it doesn’t happen too often,” says the captain, Leah Burridge, who joined in 2014. “It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and we’re going to make the most of it.” Founded in 1990 as Yetminster Ladies, after undergoing numerous rebrands – Sherborne Ladies, Yeovil Ladies and Yeovil United – last year they merged with Bridgwater Town and morphed into Bridgwater United. They have trained in Bridgwater, a town on the edge of the Somerset Levels, since 2016. Yeovil reached the WSL as a part-time club but after a switch to full-time for the 2018-19 season the club hit financial trouble, were docked 10 points, relegated and forced to start over in the third tier. That summer the club was taken over by the businessman Adam Murry, the former Bournemouth co-owner who in 2008 gave a 31-year-old Eddie Howe his first job in management. Howe kept the team in the Football League despite a 17-point deduction. The story goes that Murry, who set up a youth academy in Florida, had arranged a friendly against Yeovil but after the game was cancelled he decided to step in and buy the club. “Coming to Bridgwater reminded me a lot about the early days of when I took over Bournemouth,” he says. “It is a similar situation because we are the underdogs here. I love getting involved in challenges and Bournemouth was a big challenge for us.” Bridgwater are part-time – they train 5-10pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays – and are adding an extra weekly session to the load. They are also looking into the men’s and women’s teams training together, as Oxford United have done this season. The goalkeeper Bethany-May Howard works for Royal Mail as a postal worker and the defender Bow Jackson for the Avon fire and rescue service. Others work as teachers, sports coaches and in sales. The former Crystal Palace defender Amy Goddard helps run the commercial department and the run-up to the game has been understandably busy. “I looked in the inbox and saw 100 emails: ‘Oh, great!’” she says. “There have been a few late nights trying to get everything sorted ready for the big game. I look after all the sponsorships and doing that alongside the football makes you feel that little bit more involved.” Murry has big plans, including building what he believes would be the first dedicated women’s football stadium in the world on a nearby 11-acre site. He does not want the women’s team to be “just one page alongside the men’s”. Murry is also the team’s acting manager, taking training alongside the former Southampton academy coach Kevin Braybrook, who worked with Gareth Bale and Adam Lallana at the club. Braybrook leads a technical session – predominantly sharp passing – on a 3G pitch, adjacent to their stadium, that belongs to the local college. “We need to look after the ball because on Sunday they are going to press, press, press,” he says of the opposition. Bridgwater are third in the FA Women’s National League South. “I was lucky enough to be part of the WSL journey and to still be here and make sure the club is back on its feet and continues to move forward is special,” says the chief operating officer, Ewan Greenhill. “To have reached such a big game again, after a lot of transition and uncertainty over the last few years or so, is amazing. “It does help put our whole club on the map. There are people who have bought tickets who have never been to the ground but only live a couple of streets away and hopefully this is a platform to build and grow.” By 9.30pm and after a round of interviews – Laura Holden, who scored the winning goal against Palace in the previous round, does some keepie-uppies for the cameras – an analysis session and a return to the 3G pitch, it is time for the post-training meal: chilli and rice is on the menu. Manchester United have won their past six matches without conceding a single a goal and have struck up a rhythm under the former Birmingham manager Marc Skinner. But nothing will kill the optimism in these parts. “There’s only one United and that’s Bridgwater United,” Gudge says, breaking into a broad grin.",Sport/Football,Bridgwater buzzing for big Women’s FA Cup tie: ‘It puts club on the map’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/29/bridgwater-united-womens-fa-cup-manchester-united
