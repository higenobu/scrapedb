3/24/2022,"When Amanda Liu Chang and Jia Shihan grow old, they can tell their family members of the time they got married in the middle of a pandemic, Liu having to trudge with her wedding dress through the snow. The story began on 19 March when the couple awoke in their respective Tangshan city apartments in China’s Hebei province, looking forward to formalising their three-year romance with family and friends. But unknown to them, authorities had locked down Jia’s gated neighbourhood overnight, banning all residents from leaving, after some had tested positive for Covid-19. In keeping with custom, Jia had planned to pick up his fiance from her home at 6am. “When I tried to go outside our neighbourhood, our guard said we can’t go out at this time, that we’re isolated,” Jia told the Guardian. He phoned Liu with the bad news. “At that second I knew our wedding and everything could not be held. So I decided if he cannot get out I will come for him,” Liu says. She gathered her dress, shoes, makeup and other belongings. In a thick red coat, white sneakers and laden with bags, Liu jogged the three blocks to his community. It had snowed overnight, and temperatures had dropped to -6C. But when she arrived the guards were confused. Lockdowns were coming suddenly, amid China’s worst outbreak of the pandemic, and the guards didn’t seem to know the rules of this one. Eventually they told Liu she could come in but then she wouldn’t be allowed out again until the lockdown lifted. “Of course I wanted to come in. The guard unlocked the door and let me in, and I ran into Jia’s arms,” she said. The couple decided to push on with their plan to get married. A neighbour helped Liu with her hair and makeup, but halfway through they were ordered to get a PCR test. They complied, finished getting ready and the couple held a small ceremony inside Jia’s apartment. A neighbouring aunt acted as officiant, while Jia’s parents – who had been staying with him – looked on as witnesses. “My mum and family were in my home because they didn’t know the policy if they go outside,” says Liu. “It’s OK … My mum likes him, she thinks he is a very good son-in-law.” The couple were napping after the festivities when a relative’s classmate uploaded a video of the day to social media. By the time they woke up they were famous, with hundreds of millions of views and Chinese netizens praising the couple for finding a way through the restrictions to go ahead with their wedding. As attention built, they filmed themselves answering questions from viewers. “How does this affect our future life?” Jia read from one. “Going viral is just a short-term thing. We still have to go back to our normal life,” Liu answered. The couple are still locked in the compound. Many of Jia’s family members also live there, and so they’ve been helping to care for Jia’s nine-year-old nephew. They open one wedding gift a day, to keep themselves entertained, and are still fielding interview requests. To keep busy they play Uno and plan future trips. Jia spent four years studying in England and Scotland, and hopes to go back with his wife one day, when they are allowed to travel internationally again. Liu says she has two messages for people. “Stay home and do what you should do to help our world become normal quickly. The second thing is, you should go for your love.” Additional reporting by Xiaoqian Zhu",News/World news,"A run through the snow, PCR tests and no guests: a wedding in China’s Covid lockdown",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/a-run-through-the-snow-pcr-tests-and-no-guests-a-wedding-in-chinas-covid-lockdown
3/24/2022,"If the mark of a great TV series is poor imitators in its wake, Taskmaster is starting to look like a classic. Revive the panel show by making comedians tackle ephemeral challenges instead of just doing a quiz, it said. Easy! But if The Island (Dave) is any indication, rebottling the Taskmaster magic is far more difficult. Warning klaxons sound straight away, as the host, Tom Allen, opens proceedings by getting bogged down in explaining the concept. Four comedians are on an imaginary cruise ship that has run aground. Four uninhabited islands are within reach. Each comic must found a new society, shaping every element of its imaginary way of life, in the hope of persuading the highest number of imaginary passengers to become citizens. First, the comedians – Ninia Benjamin, Ahir Shah, Sara Pascoe and Johnny Vegas – must name their island. What’s a funny name for an island that isn’t real and, at the moment, possesses no characteristics? Well, there isn’t one. Pascoe calls hers “Magical Island”, which leads into an odd bit about the place being full of magicians. Vegas goes for “Sale Now On”, on the grounds that cruise passengers tend to be old people who are congenitally unable to resist a bargain – at least that’s a gag, albeit not a good one. Benjamin barely even tries with “St Benjamaninia”, while Shah chooses “Poyais”, because this was the name of an island invented by a 19th-century fraudster, which is less a joke and more a relevant fact. Round two asks the comedians to nominate a celebrity to be their chief of police. As the names come in – Sean Bean! Mystic Meg! Gregg Wallace! Ricky Grover, the excellent but not that well-known comic actor! – any hope that someone will have thought of a funny reason for saying them ebbs, and the fatal flaw of the set-up is confirmed. The Island is so nebulous and contrived, it is asking participants to conjure laughter up out of nothing. It’s crypto-comedy. People who are funny for a living cannot do it. With so many programmes now involving three, four or possibly five comedians thinking of things or completing tasks, a hierarchy exists that in theory decides where such shows are available. The best ideas go to terrestrial TV, with satellite channels just below. Further down the food chain are Radio 4 series, followed by overlong podcasts you reluctantly subscribe to having seen them on the Apple homepage a hundred times, followed at the very bottom by podcasts behind paywalls that non-subscribers never hear about. Being on Dave, the original home of Taskmaster before its big-money move to Channel 4, puts The Island on level two, but it should rightly be down there grubbing with the podcast hordes. Indeed, it was co-created by James Acaster and Ed Gamble, the presenters of Off Menu – a podcast where comedians talk about food they enjoy. Acaster and Gamble should probably have noticed that whereas that format prompts revealing anecdotes about real life, so that guests are funny in a new and relatable way, The Island … doesn’t. This show is a filmed podcast. The only advantage for us of being able to see the comedians, rather than idly half-listening to them while we cook, go for a run or redo some bathroom sealant, is when they make clay busts of themselves, to be assessed by Rich Miller from The Great Pottery Throw Down. Miller makes some generic ceramic-y comments (“I love the material qualities coming through”), assigns random points, then wanders off. Other than that, the comedians spend the hour sitting round a table, saying things. Near the end, they play a simple parlour game, where they have to think of famous people who have places in their names, which suggests every single scribble on the ideas-meeting whiteboard has been used. Then, we realise that, as in Taskmaster, The Island is going to feature the same people every week. This is alarming: episode one has already accidentally included several shots of Pascoe smiling wanly as another of her colleagues’ quips collapses like a sherbet canoe. How stricken is she going to look in week five? Allen perhaps deserves the most sympathy. He is an indefatigable pro in a crisis like this, able to spritz the deadest moments with vinegary camp. You feel he could have a decent crack at fronting a show where comedians name their favourite prime numbers, if that hasn’t already been commissioned by Audible as a 43-parter hosted by Dara Ó Briain. Allen does provide the episode’s funniest moment, but when that moment is him pretending the sound of the ship’s horn is him farting, it’s clear this vessel is stuck. The Island is beyond rescue.",Arts/Television & radio,The Island review – this nautical panel show is so laugh-free it’s a wreck,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/23/the-island-review-this-nautical-panel-show-is-so-laugh-free-its-a-wreck
3/24/2022,"Two of the five officers who were involved in the traumatic strip search of a 15-year-old black girl in her school in Hackney, London, have been removed from frontline duties, the Metropolitan police has confirmed. The admission came at a community meeting on Wednesday evening as anger over the treatment of the girl, known as Child Q, continues. The meeting was originally supposed to take place in person but had to be moved online after the police force could not find a venue. More than 250 people attended, with more wanting to but unable to join because of the meeting’s limit. Tensions were high on the call with many frustrated and angry attenders saying that the force was institutionally racist, and that they had not addressed the issue face on. The police panel, led by Hackney’s Basic Unit commander, Marcus Barnett, admitted that the Met has a problem with officers viewing inner London children as “adults”, adding that what happened to Child Q would probably not have happened to a child living in the Cotswolds, as an example. “I think we view inner London kids as adults, the issue we have in policing at the moment is that we view kids and we believe that kids in London are more resilient than they are,” said detective superintendent Dan Rutland, who was also on the panel. It was also confirmed that two of the officers that conducted the search in December 2020 have been removed from frontline duties. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is investigating the incident. The meeting also revealed that Barnett knew about the girl being strip searched in January 2021. Officers were called due to a teacher wrongly suspecting that she had cannabis. He added that the school “probably should not have called us and we should probably have understood very quickly that we had no role to play there”. Chanel Dolcy, a solicitor at Bhatt Murphy, which is representing the family in proceedings against the police, said Child Q had launched civil proceedings against the force and her school seeking to hold both institutions to account “to ensure this never happens again to any other child”. She added: “The Metropolitan police has seemed incapable of reform for generations, and it is difficult to say it will ever change.”",News/UK news,Two Met officers who strip-searched school girl removed from frontline duties,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/two-met-officers-who-strip-searched-school-girl-removed-from-frontline-duties
3/24/2022,"The UK will double the number of missiles it sends to Ukraine and urge western allies to step up provisions of lethal aid to the country, as the Russian invasion turns into a prolonged war of attrition. Boris Johnson will tell world leaders at the Nato summit on Thursday that the conflict is entering a new phase of aggression and humanitarian catastrophe with the siege of Mariupol and the indiscriminate attacks on civilians. Western officials have said that both the Ukrainians and the Russians are running short of weapons as the conflict grinds on due to Ukrainian defence that was far better than expected – and that they had anticipated they would be supporting a smaller Ukrainian insurgency by this stage. Ahead of the summit, Johnson said the UK would provide 6,000 new defensive missiles, including high-explosive weapons, and £25m from Foreign Office funds to help Ukraine pay its military and police forces. Not all of the missiles are expected to be next-generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAWs) – of which the UK has already provided more than 4,200. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was filmed saying that the UK would send more missiles but was “running out of our own” on a prank call last week. The additional weaponry means that the UK has now provided more than 10,000 missiles. It will be supplying Starstreak high-velocity anti-air missiles to help Ukrainians defend themselves against aerial bombings, as well as body armour, helmets and combat boots. But No 10 said it was hoped that international partners would also send weapons needed for longer-range targeting and intelligence. The talks with Nato and G7 leaders, which will be followed by a European Council meeting to which Johnson has not been invited, mark one month since the Russian invasion. “Vladimir Putin is already failing in Ukraine,” Johnson said in a statement ahead of the summit in Brussels. “The Ukrainian people have shown themselves to be extraordinarily brave and tenacious in defending their homeland, in the face of an unprovoked onslaught. But we cannot and will not stand by while Russia grinds Ukraine’s towns and cities into dust. “The United Kingdom will work with our allies to step up military and economic support to Ukraine, strengthening their defences as they turn the tide in this fight. One month into this crisis, the international community faces a choice. We can keep the flame of freedom alive in Ukraine, or risk it being snuffed out across Europe and the world.” No 10 said that 4 million items of medical equipment and 500 mobile generators will also be sent to Ukraine.",News/World news,UK doubles number of missiles sent to Ukraine ahead of Nato summit,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/uk-doubles-number-of-missiles-sent-to-ukraine-ahead-of-nato-summit
3/24/2022,"The BBC World Service is to get £4.1m in extra funding to support its Ukrainian and Russian services, the government has announced. Ministers said the funding would “cover urgent and unexpected costs” that have arisen as a result of the invasion of Ukraine and would help the corporation to tackle disinformation “in the face of systemic propaganda”. Its extra costs include relocating many Russian-based staff out of the country to safe locations in a bid to comply with laws restricting the reporting of the war. The BBC already receives direct government funding to the tune of £100m a year from the Foreign Office for many of its World Service operations, often in countries that are seen as key to Britain’s strategic aims. The corporation said it believes its output was playing a “valuable role in challenging the Kremlin’s disinformation” but it is facing “additional costs from operating within a military conflict and due to a crackdown on independent reporting in Russia”. The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, who recently announced another real terms cut to the BBC’s licence fee income that is likely to result in further job cuts, said it was the corporation that had asked for the emergency funding. She said the government would provide the cash to bring western news to audiences in Russia and Ukraine. She said: “In scenes reminiscent of 80 years ago, the BBC will ensure that audiences in the region can continue to access independent news reporting in the face of systemic propaganda from a dictator waging war on European soil. It’s vital we lift the veil on and expose the barbaric actions of [Vladimir] Putin’s forces.” Russian officials have repeatedly attempted to portray the BBC’s coverage of Ukraine as being a tool of the British government. The BBC’s Russian language website has been banned in the country, although can be accessed using VPNs. Yet despite threatening retaliation after media regulator Ofcom decided to permanently ban Kremlin-backed news station RT from British airwaves, Moscow has so far not stopped the BBC’s English-language journalists reporting from the country. Welcoming the government’s announcement of £4.1m, the BBC director-general, Tim Davie, said the money would “enable us to continue expanding the ways we are reaching audiences in Russia and Ukraine”. He added: “The BBC has seen a big demand for clear, fact-based, impartial journalism to counter disinformation and our teams are working around the clock to bring people the very best independent journalism.”",News/Media,BBC World Service to get extra £4.1m to support Ukrainian and Russian services,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/23/bbc-world-service-to-get-extra-41m-to-support-ukrainian-and-russian-services
3/24/2022,"Steve Clarke has admitted to serious doubts that Scotland’s World Cup play-off semi-final against Ukraine will take place on its rescheduled early June date. Ukraine’s visit to Hampden Park, originally set for Thursday, was postponed due to Russia’s invasion of the country. It has since emerged that several of Ukraine’s squad have signed up for military service. Scotland will host Poland in a friendly instead, with £10 from every ticket sold being donated to Unicef’s Ukrainian aid efforts. Provisional Uefa and Fifa plans involve Scotland facing Ukraine on a June date originally intended for Nations League fixtures, with the winners to face Wales or Austria days later for a World Cup place. Clarke, while adamant the semi-final should take place if at all possible, is sceptical about that happening in little more than two months. “The very short answer is ‘no’,” the Scotland manager said when asked whether there had been an update on the play-off. “I would imagine everyone is waiting until this round of matches is out of the way and then see how the situation develops. But, obviously, it’s not looking great at this moment. “If you’re asking me now will the game go ahead in June then it’s going to be difficult,” Clarke added. “But it’s a situation we can’t control, so I’ll focus on these two friendlies and make sure we get something out of the games in this camp. “Then, maybe in April, we can all sit down together, look at the schedule and how it’s going to pan out for us. It’s difficult to see how we’ll be playing them in June and it’s not just about the fixture – it’s the fact that they need to get together, have a training camp and get all their players on the pitch with a proper period of time to prepare for such an important game. “Andriy Shevchenko, who I know from my time at Chelsea, spoke quite well about the situation and said they would want to play on the pitch. The way the situation is I think they should get as much time as possible to try to make that game happen, Scotland against Ukraine at Hampden.” It remains unclear what would happen if June proves an unviable option. The game could be pushed into the September international window. “We have to be guided by Fifa, Uefa and most importantly by Ukraine themselves,” Clarke added. “It’s just a horrible, horrible situation and the quicker we know we’re going to play Ukraine at Hampden the better because it will mean the war has stopped and we’re all trying to move forward again. We have to be guided by other people and hope and pray that the situation improves enough for the fixture to go ahead at some time.” The Scotland captain, Andrew Robertson, will miss the Poland match because of illness, but the Liverpool full-back may return for the friendly against Wales or Austria on Tuesday. Clarke is expected to name his strongest available team, with Everton’s Nathan Patterson likely to play at right-back despite a shortage of domestic minutes since his £11m January move from Rangers. The Poland head coach, Czeslaw Michniewicz, in charge of the team for the first time, denied he would shuffle his pack drastically with next week’s play-off final against Sweden or the Czech Republic in mind.",Sport/Football,Steve Clarke unsure if Scotland play-off with Ukraine will go ahead in June,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/23/steve-clarke-unsure-if-scotland-play-off-with-ukraine-will-go-ahead-in-june
3/24/2022,"It has been a month since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, and such has been the intensity of the first phase of the fighting that both sides in the conflict have increasingly depleted their stocks of ammunition and other military supplies. But while Ukraine is willing to claim that the Russian invaders have only three days of supplies left, while warning that its own troops are running out of anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems, the reality is hard to measure. “Resupply issues are hard to gauge, as both sides are keeping that information close to their chest due to operational security concerns,” said Nick Reynolds, a land warfare specialist with the Rusi thinktank. For Ukraine there is a particular concern that it is running short on the western-supplied weapons that have helped it knock out Russian tanks and planes. Kyiv’s military has been requesting a huge number more weapons in the run-up to the Nato summit on Thursday, and has secured a commitment from Britain to send 5,000 more missiles. It is also clear that Russia is suffering from serious logistical constraints that have forced it to abandon its clearly over-optimistic plan to simultaneously encircle Kyiv and Kharkiv and attack from the south and east. Western officials believe it has lost the ability to fight an offensive on multiple axes, partly because of resupply issues but also because of the casualties it has sustained – somewhere between 7,000 and 10,000 – and it is now simply focusing on trying to capture Mariupol with a brutal and long-running bombardment. An important sign of the scale of Russia’s difficulties will be if Ukraine can muster an effective counterattack in the Irpin area north-west of the capital, which has seen some of the most deadly fighting from almost the beginning of the war. “If the early reports of a Ukrainian counter-offensive in the Irpin area prove accurate, this will be a key indicator that Russian supply problems along the Kyiv axis of advance have not been rectified, though casualties, low morale and poor operational coordination will also have played a role,” Reynolds said. The prevailing view, however, remains that the advantage sits with the aggressor. “Russia retains, in overall terms, significant materiel and personnel reserves that it can draw upon,” said one western source, speaking on condition of anonymity. But the supply lines are complicated for some of the invading forces, particularly those from Russia’s far-off easternmost districts. Ukraine’s problem is more serious. The country’s arms industry was already far smaller than Russia’s and many of its industrial areas in the east have been heavily damaged by the war. It is long-term damage, which, judging by the scant regard Moscow has shown for civilian casualties, was probably partly deliberate. Kyiv, in terms of most of the key military hardware, is now entirely reliant on a regular, continuing flow of supply from the west to counteract Russia’s ability to mass tanks and air power against Ukrainian defenders and people. But such high-end weapons can easily be used in warfare far faster than they can be manufactured. When it comes to arms and ammunition, that could mean a longer fight is to Russia’s advantage, if the Kremlin is willing to continue to tolerate large numbers of casualties. Unfortunately, Vladimir Putin appears willing to do just that.",News/World news,Military supplies depleted on both sides but Russia retains advantage,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/military-supplies-depleted-on-both-sides-but-russia-retains-advantage
