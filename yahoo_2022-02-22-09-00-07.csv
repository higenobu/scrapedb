2/22/2022,"A Chinese woman purportedly studying in Brisbane, Australia, was recently filmed rejecting the claim of Uyghur Muslims being detained in ""concentration camps"" in China as she took down posters featuring photos of the Tiananmen Square protests created to support Hong Kong’s democracy.

The incident, filmed by Billie Kugelman, chief editor of student newspaper Semper Floreat at the University of Queensland, was shared online by Drew Pavlou, an outspoken critic of the Chinese government and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) who is running to “represent Queensland in the Australian senate.”

The video shows the unidentified woman, whose face is blurred, arguing with Kugelman as she tears down posters from the university’s Lennon Wall.

“You are ruining my liberty. I don't want to show my face,” the woman tells Kugelman. “I just want to show that I'm not (afraid) to show my freedom.”

Kugelmen responds by saying her face will be blurred in the video, then says, “Can you tell me a bit about why you think it's right to rip these down?”

“Do you think you are right to tell these lies to the students, especially those teenagers?” the woman replies, referring to the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and its photos featured on the posters, one of them being the iconic photo of the ""Tank Man.""

“I don't think they are lies,” Kugleman responds. He asks her if she knows what happened during the massacre – which occurred around 33 years ago – to which she replies, “No, I don't know about that because it happened 40 to 50 years ago... It happened decades ago. I'm just thinking about now, thinking about the future, the students, the teenagers. What's your big influence by this wall?”

“I think the intent is to make them think twice about what’s happening,” Kugelman replies. He eventually brings up the Uyghurs, a Muslim-majority ethnic minority in northwest China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) that has been described as the ""most persecuted ethnicity"" in China, as NextShark previously reported.

“As far as I'm aware, there are Uyghur Muslims in concentration camps,” Kugelman tells the woman after she brings out her phone and fails to show him what “what China is looking like.”

The woman then laughs exaggeratedly at the term “concentration camps.”

""You have jails in Australia, you have jails in Australia,"" the woman says as she walks out on Kugelman.

Pavlou identified the woman as a “Chinese international student” in his tweet on Thursday, but Kugelman corrected him, saying that the woman claimed she was not a student of the university.

So no, I won't give them her face,” he wrote.  Pavlou recently drew international attention for his campaign to produce and hand out T-shirts emblazoned with the words “Where is Peng Shuai?” at the 2022 Australian Open. The shirts refer to the Chinese tennis star who disappeared from the public eye for two weeks after making sexual assault accusations against a Chinese official.     Featured Image via @DrewPavlou Enjoy this content?

2/22/2022,"Donald Trump is still trying to blame anyone but himself for his longtime accounting firm’s decision last week to sever ties with the Trump Organization. He insisted Sunday that the firm Mazars USA was “broken” by “Radical leftist racist prosecutors.” Trump offers no evidence for his accusations that the prosecutors are racist. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and state Attorney General Letitia James — who are both investigating Trump Organization business practices — are Black. Trump quoted Mazars’ statement that it “performed its work in accordance with professional standards.” But Mazars didn’t say the same about the Trump Organization. Mazars terminated its relationship, it explained in a letter that was part of a court document filed last week, because 10 years of financial statements it had prepared with records provided by the Trump Organization could no longer be considered reliable. NEW!

President Donald J. Trump:

“My long-term accounting firm didn’t leave me for any other reason than they were harassed, abused, and frightened by DA’s and AG’s that for years have been threatening them with indictment and ruination. They were “broken” by these Radical... pic.twitter.com/cdcSeZENDl — Liz Harrington (@realLizUSA) February 20, 2022 It ducked out of its relationship with Trump as the attorney general investigates whether Trump inflated asset values to obtain bank loans and entice investors, and reduced values to lower tax bills Trump also claimed in his first, lengthy statement about Mazars’ defection last Tuesday that the company had been “threatened” and “intimidated” by James’ office to back away from his business. He went on at length to discuss his own company’s finances and financial practices. The statement complicated legal issues for him. Just the day before, his attorneys had argued that Trump knows virtually nothing about the financial details of his own company, and therefore, could hardly be held accountable for practices being investigated by James. James quickly fired off a letter to the judge presiding over her investigation about Trump’s first Mazars statement, noting that it flatly contradicted claims by his own attorneys. Clearly, Trump knows “exactly what OAG is investigating,” she wrote, referencing the Office of the Attorney General. Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron last Thursday ordered Trump and his children Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. to sit for depositions to answer questions under oath concerning the Trump Organization and James’ probe.

2/22/2022,"Is that strange customer for here or to go? A Texas mom went on Facebook to thank baristas at a Corpus Christi Starbucks who she said looked out for her teenager daughter when a man inside the coffee shop approached the 18-year-old customer. According to Brandy Selim Roberson’s Facebook page, a quick-thinking Starbucks employee saw a potentially uncomfortable situation brewing and slyly handed the young woman a paper cup with a message scrawled across it. “Are you ok?” read the cup. “Do you want us to intervene?” The writing on the cup instructed Roberson’s daughter to remove the lid if she felt unsafe. “A barista handed her an extra hot chocolate someone forgot to pick up,’” Roberson explained. “How grateful I am for people who look out for other people! Though her daughter felt no need to remove the lid from the cup, Robeson expressed gratitude to the Starbucks workers who had her covered just the same. “She said the whole team was watching over her the rest of the time she was there,” Robeson wrote. Facebook users — some of whom were themselves mothers — shared Robeson’s enthusiasm over the Good Samaritans looking out for their neighbor. “Love it,” wrote Jennifer Stockton. “I hope someone looks out for my girls, like this!!” Robeson told NBC’s “Today” that the incident happened Saturday night while her daughter was studying at the coffee shop. The man, whom the teen reportedly didn’t know, seemed “quite animated,” which got the attention of the baristas on duty. “Today” said the stranger picked up on the fact the person he’d approached was communicating with staffers and left her alone.",U.S./NY Daily News,Starbucks barista scribbles note on cup to help teen customer,https://news.yahoo.com/starbucks-barista-scribbles-note-cup-212500403.html
