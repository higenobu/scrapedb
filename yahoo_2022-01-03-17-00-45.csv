Investors are also focusing on the policy trajectory of the Federal Reserve and other central banks into 2022, particularly as inflation continues to present a challenge. There’s a “positive setup into 2022 with Fed and Covid headwinds to ease, and China policy tailwinds,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists led by Mixo Das in Hong Kong, wrote in a report Sunday. “Overall, our economists see less disruption to economic activity and above trend global growth this quarter, particularly in Asia. In terms of Fed tightening, the moment of peak disruption for markets may also be passing.” Asia’s factory activity continued to expand in December, according to a slew of data released Monday, boosted by resilient demand and the easing of supply-chain bottlenecks. While no specific reason was given for the halt in Evergrande trading, Chinese developer shares sank amid local-media reports that the company had been ordered to tear down apartment blocks at a project in Hainan province.
