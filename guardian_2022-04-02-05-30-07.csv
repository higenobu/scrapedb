4/2/2022,"It’s unclear when exactly the US will know the identity of their opponents in their first game, given the ongoing invasion of Ukraine, but some time in June appears most likely. Wales, who beat Austria 2-1 in a playoff semi-final on 24 March courtesy of two superb goals from Gareth Bale, will face the winners of a match between Scotland and Ukraine. Wales were semi-finalists at Euro 2016 and reached the round of 16 at Euro 2020. They would perhaps represent the most challenging opponents for Gregg Berhalter’s men. Bale will be 33 at kick-off in Qatar but the Real Madrid reserve remains a formidable talent, while the pace of Leeds United attacker Dan James tormented Austria. Scotland were bottom of their group at Euro 2020. They were ultimately well beaten by the Czech Republic and Croatia but did pick up a point with a spirited performance against England at Wembley. Ukraine were third in their group behind the Netherlands and Austria but still made it to the quarter-finals. They raised their game for a 2-1 extra-time win over Sweden in the first knockout round, but lost 4-0 to England. Fifa world ranking Wales 18th; Ukraine 27th; Scotland 39th Best World Cup performance Wales, quarter-finals, 1958; Ukraine, quarter-finals, 2006; Scotland, group stage, eight times A fixture that always fizzes with historical and cultural resonance, and it’ll be extra-special not only for Chelsea’s Christian Pulisic, but for two other players who started against Costa Rica this week: Yunus Musah, a former England youth international who was courted by Gareth Southgate before choosing the US last year, and the Milton Keynes-born Fulham defender Antonee Robinson. England ran out 3-0 winners in the most recent meeting between the sides, a friendly in 2018 that was DC United legend Wayne Rooney’s international farewell – not that a game from four years ago means much considering the US’s dramatic rebuilding job under Berhalter. Both nations are replete with exciting young talent, Jude Bellingham at the top of the English rising star list – but England are a few years ahead of the US on the learning curve and boast more recent big tournament experience and more players at leading clubs. Their depth and ability in midfield is likely to pose problems for the US – as it would for most teams. The current American first-choice center back pairing of Miles Robinson and Walker Zimmerman have been stalwarts in Concacaf qualifying lately, but will the MLS pair be able to handle Harry Kane and Raheem Stirling? Famously – or infamously, depending on whether you spell “color” with a “u” or not – the nations met in 1950 and 2010, when Steven Gerrard’s early goal settled any English nerves. Oh wait, it didn’t. A few minutes before half time came the spill heard round the world, as goalkeeper Robert Green’s howler donated an equalizer to Clint Dempsey. The game ended 1-1 and thanks to Landon Donovan’s late heroics against Algeria the US went on to top the group ahead of Fabio Capello’s side. Southgate’s team is more vibrant, more talented, more cohesive and coached far better, than that elderly, stilted and stressed-out England crop. They reached the semi-finals four years ago, losing 2-1 after extra time to a more savvy Croatia. Were it not for the manager’s tactical caution in last year’s Euro 2020 final against Italy, as the Three Lions failed to add to an early lead then were pinned back in the second half (similar to the Croatia semi), and the mismanagement of the penalty shootout, they’d probably be going into this tournament as European champions. As it is, they’re likely to be hungry, confident and still improving when November rolls around. England were imperious in qualifying, albeit in a relatively easy group, scoring 39 times and conceding only three goals. They are the obvious favorites to top Group B in Qatar. Key player Harry Kane Fifa world ranking 5th How they qualified First in group, with eight wins and two draws from 10 games Best World Cup performance Winners, 1966 Not a team to take lightly. This will be the third successive World Cup appearance for Iran, who ended up with the most points of any side in the final round of the Asian qualifiers. They reached Qatar back in January with three group games to spare. And they conceded only four goals as they topped their group’s table ahead of South Korea, who nonetheless beat them 2-0 in Seoul on 24 March. Though Iran will be taking part in their sixth World Cup, they’ve never gone beyond the group stage. They were fairly impressive while finishing third in their group in 2018, though: beating Morocco 1-0 in their opening game, losing 1-0 to Spain, then securing a 1-1 draw with Portugal courtesy of an injury-time penalty. In 29-year-old Porto striker Mehdi Taremi, who has scored 21 times this season for club and country, Iran have a bona fide goal threat – even when he’s upside-down. So is Sardar Azmoun, who joined Bayer Leverkusen in January after a prolific spell with Zenit St Petersburg. There was, though, some tension last year between Taremi and the head coach, Dragan Skočić. That seems to be in the past; after all, they reportedly followed each other on Twitter, so everything must be OK. Skočić, a 53-year-old Croatia-born managerial nomad, took charge in 2020 after seven years coaching club football in Iran. Iran and the US met back at France ’98, Iran running out 2-1 winners in a politically-fraught encounter. A friendly two years later in California was a 1-1 draw.

4/2/2022,"The Metropolitan police has been urged by a council boss to accept that institutional racism is a problem in the force after the treatment of Child Q, a 15-year-old black girl who was strip-searched by officers at her school in London. Hackney council has challenged the Met to “again, accept that institutional racism – as defined in the Stephen Lawrence report – is a consistent factor in the relationship between the police and the Black and Global Majority communities, and in their wider experiences”. They said this might prevent a similar incident happening again and restore trust and confidence. The girl was strip-searched at her east London school by two female officers in Hackney in December 2020, after being wrongly suspected of carrying drugs. Protests were held in London last month after a report by the City & Hackney Safeguarding Children Partnership, which found that Child Q – who was having her period at the time – was made to remove her clothing, underwear and a sanitary pad, spread her buttocks and cough. The review concluded that racism was “likely” to have been a factor, Child Q should never have been strip-searched and there was an absence of a safeguarding-first approach. In a letter to the Met, Hackney council’s chief executive, Mark Carroll, has proposed a safeguarding-led briefing event for parents, carers and guardians, who may have concerns about their children’s safety and wellbeing in schools. Carroll has also recommended that the force bring community partners together in workshops to appraise the police response, help shape a strategic plan, and identify the ways in which they can continue to be involved in the strategy. Carroll wrote: “As you recognise, Child Q should have been treated with dignity and respect. She should have been treated as the child she is: her rights as a child, safeguarded; and her position as a child protected by the adults around her that day. “It is clear that she was wholly failed, and together we must all make sure that this is never allowed to happen again. Hackney council accepts the review panel’s finding that this appalling and humiliating experience was ‘likely influenced’ by racism. “We welcome your recognition of the pain and anger that the experience of Child Q has caused in our communities, and that it has had a direct impact on their trust and confidence in the Metropolitan police. The family of Child Q are clear that they too want this to be a moment of real change.” Child Q’s mother and aunt have said the strip search has traumatised her. Two of the police officers involved have been removed from frontline duty. A recent Freedom of Information request to the Met revealed that the force conducted about 9,000 strip searches on children in the past five years. In Hackney, 60% of the children strip-searched last year were black. Carroll’s letter was in response to the Met’s reply the previous day to the council’s initial letter about the Child Q incident. Laurence Taylor, deputy assistant commissioner of frontline policing, wrote: “I want to start by clearly stating that the MPS acknowledges that events in the history of policing London have led to a breakdown in trust and confidence with some communities. “It is of the upmost importance that we address this, but recognise it is not easy. We have clearly stated our intention to rebuild trust and confidence and want to work with our communities and partners to help us do this and become a truly anti-racist organisation.” He added: “We are in full agreement with the review that this incident should never have happened. It is more than regrettable and as you noted we have apologised to the child concerned, her family and the wider community.” Taylor also announced a pilot scheme across Hackney and Tower Hamlets for searches. In addition to the current requirement of a conversation with a supervisor and the presence of an appropriate adult, officers will now require the authority of a police inspector before a search takes place. Officers will also require a Merlin report – a Met police database of children they come into contact with – to be submitted for all such searches.",News/UK news,Met police urged to admit racism after strip-search of black girl in Hackney,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/01/met-police-urged-to-admit-racism-after-strip-search-of-black-girl-in-hackney
