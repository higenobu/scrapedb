12/16/2021,"A Connecticut school board member was slugged in the face by an angry parent Tuesday night during a debate on the future of Glastonbury High School’s Native American-inspired mascot. The dust-up between the parent, Mark Finocchiaro, and board secretary Ray McFall, took place during a 10-minute recess after tempers flared amid a public comment period about the Glastonbury Tomahawks name, which was changed last year to the Glastonbury Guardians. The school’s team logos were also switched from a tomahawk, which many found offensive, to a knight’s helmet. A committee was formed to consider changing the Tomahawks name and logo in the wake of nationwide protests following the murder of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, by a Minneapolis police officer. The choice was all-but solidified when the National Congress of American Indians subsequently contacted the board and asked that the tomahawk logo and mascot be phased out. Because of pandemic restrictions at the time, the Glastonbury school board was convening only online, and accepting opinions from the community via the internet. A petition started by Glastonbury residents argued that the process denied them an “opportunity to provide meaningful input,” and demanded that the school’s tomahawk logo and mascot be restored. On Tuesday evening, the board held a special meeting to discuss the issue in-person. Cellphone video recorded by bystanders at Tuesday’s session showed Finocchiaro, 53, confront the 57-year-old McFall, standing nose-to-nose with the former Marine Corps officer. When McFall gently pushed Finocchiaro away, Finocchiaro responded by punching McFall, who immediately dropped to the floor. Parents Fume Over Handling of Vile ‘White Power’ Video With School Board Prez’s Kid McFall was able to get back up on his own and did not appear to be seriously injured. Glastonbury Town Councilman John Cavanna was at the meeting, and stepped in to break up the altercation. “I was up near the stage area when I heard voices get raised, and I turned to make my way over there,” Cavanna, who is also a sergeant with the Hartford Police Department, told The Daily Beast on Wednesday. “Folks in the audience know me as the type of guy that will maintain order. So people started yelling my name, and I turned to see Mr. McFall, who had apparently gone off to confront the other gentleman.” Before Cavanna could step in, he said he saw McFall “pushing the parent,” after which “the parent struck him.” Cavanna, a 17-year police veteran, said he was wholly disheartened by the fracas, adding, “I wouldn’t be surprised if they arrest both, and it will be for a judge to decide what transpired.” “Honestly, at the end of the day, it’s just sad that something like that had to take place,” Cavanna said. “To see it get to the point where folks are physically going after each other is just sad. We’re never going to get anything accomplished if we don't work together.” Lt. Mark Davis of the Glastonbury Police told The Daily Beast that the department is “investigating the altercation.” “No charges have been filed yet, but our investigation is ongoing at this point,” he said. Finocchiaro’s niece, Miranda Beach—who was there and filmed the attack—told The Daily Beast that the family has been instructed not to say anything about the confrontation “because we’re in contact with lawyers and the police. He doesn’t want to say anything until we get that all figured out.” McFall did not respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment. In a statement provided to The Daily Beast by the Glastonbury Public Schools Board, Superintendent Alan Bookman said the board was forced to adjourn the meeting “without voting on the matter.” “The Board of Education welcomes public comment and appreciates that there will always be passionate testimony when controversial issues are considered,” the statement said. “But it is critical that we listen to each other with respect and follow meeting rules so that everyone can be heard.” Bookman’s assistant told The Daily Beast that he is unable to comment on the incident at this time “because it is a police matter.” Once the school board decided to change the Tomahawks name and logo last year, they issued a call for ideas from students and faculty. Glastonbury High School senior Prasham Vachhani designed the logo—a knight’s helmet—that was ultimately used for the new Glastonbury Guardians. “I thought of it as a particular character in my head,” Vachhani, 18, told the Hartford Courant in March. “This guardian does not back out of stuff, and that’s what we represent—we don’t back out, we don’t quit.” Some were upset by the change, and Glastonbury High senior Erin Cabana started a petition last year to keep the Tomahawks name. “The Glastonbury High School Tomahawks must stay,” she wrote. “While I understand its tie to the Native Americans, in today’s day and age, tomahawks are a tool that people everywhere use. In fact there are even tomahawk throwing competitions. It is simply an axe type weapon/tool that was invented by the Native Americans. It’s not like Glastonbury is ‘stealing their tool’ or ‘making fun of it’ when it’s something you can find at any local hardware store and it has proven to be a very helpful tool. There’s no Native American in the logo either, it’s just an axe like graphic. What is offensive about an axe?” Numerous Connecticut high schools have abandoned Native American-inspired names and mascots in recent years. In 1996, Newtown High School became the first in the state to update its name from the Indians to the Nighthawks. In 2015, Northwest Catholic High School in West Hartford changed its name from the Indians to the Lions. “This was not done for any political correctness, this was done because in our time and in our history it was the right time to do it,” Northwest Catholic administrator David Eustis said at the time. “It wasn’t about being first. It was about doing what is right for our 600 kids.” Last April, the Newington High School Indians became the Nor’Easters. A month later, Farmington High School ditched its own Indians name and logo in favor of the River Hawks. On the other hand, Killingly Public Schools in January 2020 reverted back to their old name and mascot, the Redmen, in the face of widespread community opposition. The issue is not going away anytime soon. In February, the West Hartford Public Schools board will take a vote about whether or not to change the names of the Conard High Chieftains and the Hall High School Warriors.

12/16/2021,"One of FL Gov. DeSantis' Democratic opponents accused him of making appointments to state university boards of trustees conditional upon campaign reelection donations. Nikki Fried, the state agriculture commissioner, made the allegation Tuesday night. The DeSantis campaign and the Florida university system's press office did not return Insider's requests for comment. Nikki Fried, Florida's agriculture commissioner and a Democratic candidate for governor, has accused Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis of trying to leverage campaign donations over members of the Florida public university system's boards of trustees. Fried is the only Democrat to win a statewide election in Florida since 2018, and is one of three Democrats challenging DeSantis in next August's primary. DeSantis is already considered a rising GOP star and contender for the party's 2024 presidential nomination by some Republican insiders. He has come under scrutiny from critics for appointing major donors to boards of trustees across the state's university system and signing a controversial law on what he's described as student ""indoctrination"" at the public institutions of higher learning, threatening to defund campuses without adequate ""ideological diversity."" ""I don't know if this is as public. You all should know,"" Fried said at a virtual town hall event held Tuesday night by the United Faculty of Florida Union. ""Our current boards of trustees across the state were required to give a campaign contribution to Ron DeSantis in the amount of $100,000,"" she continued. ""And if they didn't give him the campaign contribution, they were not reappointed to the boards. That is what we are dealing with here in the state of Florida with this Governor."" Her allegation, first reported by Scott Powers of Florida Politics, goes beyond the otherwise common practice of public university board of trustees members being appointed after donating to a winning candidate's gubernatorial campaign. It is entirely legal for someone to donate tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to a prospective governor's campaign and then receive a state government appointment, but threatening current board of trustee members over reelection donations is a far more serious charge. While Fried's campaign declined to comment on how she heard of the alleged demand from DeSantis — citing ""a private conversation"" — a campaign spokesperson doubled down on the claim. ""DeSantis' appointments are stacked with his biggest donors — and the Boards of Trustees are no different,"" Drew Godinich, the campaign spokesperson, told Insider in an email. ""DeSantis' corruption knows no limits — even when it means compromising on Floridians' schools."" Neither the DeSantis campaign nor the University of Florida's communications office returned Insider's requests for comment. Republican Party of Florida Executive Director Helen Aguirre Ferré denied Fried's allegation. ""It is a bald faced lie, which is par for the course for Fried,"" she told Florida Politics. At least nine current members on boards of trustees across Florida's university system have made donations to the DeSantis 2022 campaign or the state GOP, either in their own name, through their company, or via a spouse, according to state campaign finance records, which are available in a public database. Representatives at the University of Florida communications office would not put Insider in touch with board members who have donated to DeSantis or the state GOP so far this election cycle. Among those trustees are Carlos Duart of Florida International University, the University of Central Florida's Bill Chrisite, Jeff Condello, and Joe Conte, the University of Florida's Mori Hosseini, Richard Cole, and Rahul Patel, as well as the University of South Florida's Will Weatherford and Leslie Muma. Muma's wife gave $100,000 to the DeSantis campaign this year, while the smallest donation amount was $25,000 from Hosseini to the Florida GOP and Weatherford to DeSantis. In Tuesday night's virtual town hall, Fried promised to clear the boards of GOP campaign donors. ""While I won't be able to immediately fire them all,"" she said, ""certainly when their reappointments come in play, I will not be reappointing those members of boards of trustees that are all campaign donors to the Republican Party.""

12/16/2021,"Editor’s Note: This article contains mentions of sexual violence against minors. Please take care while reading, and note the helpful resources at the end of this story. The first rule of r/DuggarsSnark is that there are no fans allowed.  The subreddit is dedicated to “snarking on” — playfully or sarcastically mocking — the Duggar family. The former stars of the megahit TLC show 19 Kids and Counting and its spinoff Counting On include a politician patriarch and his adoring wife, with focus on their 19 children and a number of spouses and grandchildren.  ‘What a quaint, wholesome family’ The Duggars first found fame in 2004 with a one-hour TV special called 14 Kids and Pregnant Again. They caught public attention because of their many children (whose names all start with the letter “J”) and their strict religious rules tied to a “cult-like” Christian sect known as the Institute in Basic Life Principles (IBLP). One of the most distinguishing aspects of the Duggars initially was their unmistakable fashion sense, particularly among the female family members. Traveling home for the holidays? Here are 4 things you need to do right now A well-known image of the eldest daughters — Jana, Jill, Jessa and Jinger — shows the girls sporting uniforms, elbow-length permed hair and long skirts typical of modest dress. Members of r/DuggarsSnark told In The Know they found their appearance to be unusual in a way that kept them coming back for more and more episodes of the family’s eventual series. “When the show was airing, way back when, I remember my mom talking about what a quaint wholesome family the Duggars were,” estesparkranger, one of the original moderators for r/DuggarsSnark, told In The Know. “Later, once I saw the belief system beneath the glossy, perfect TV family, I started getting mad that no one knew they held all these archaic beliefs. A snarker was born.”  Look your best this holiday season with top fashion items from Walmart: As the Duggar girls grew up, the world watched and waited for them and their married brothers to decide whether they would break free from IBLP standards. That rapt attention is comparable to the way some audiences treat child stars, only instead of expecting a huge mental breakdown, Duggar followers just wanted to see who would cut their hair, wear pants or have fewer than four children.  How the Duggars helped normalize purity culture Critics of the Duggar family and fundamentalist Christianity identified that the beauty standards they adhere to are known as “purity culture” — a movement that gained prominence in the 1990s that placed sexual purity as a virtue above all else.  It was not unpopular for Christians to wear “purity rings” as a promise to abstain from sex until marriage, but the Duggars faced even more intense rules. All dates between couples who were “courting” had to be chaperoned. Holding hands was reserved for engagement, and for many, the first kiss comes on the wedding day. Virginity was everything.  Purity culture shined through many episodes of the Duggar shows. Women had to dress modestly, covering their knees, at the risk of “defrauding” the men around them. Sexual sin appeared to be especially heinous compared to other moral boundaries they set. Rachel Joy Welcher, the author of Talking Back to Purity Culture: Rediscovering Faithful Christian Sexuality, wrote that purity culture was well-intentioned but full of gross errors. It made sexual purity a prize that could be lost — in direct contradiction with the central tenant of Christianity that claims all will be forgiven. It burdened women with the responsibility to control male lust, as well. Purity culture ultimately failed victims of sexual abuse, who would, by purity culture principles, be forever considered impure because of an offense committed against them. How the Josh Duggar trial affected r/DuggarsSnark Members of r/DuggarsSnark noticed this pattern in the Duggar family and often critiqued it. On the forum, you’ll notice “snark” on the minutiae in the lives of the Duggars — Jill dyed her hair blonde, Jessa named her baby “Spurgeon,” Jinger wiped her daughters’ faces from social media, and so on. But since April 29, 2021, visitors may have noticed an influx of serious posts. On that date, the eldest Duggar son, Josh, was arrested. Days later, he was indicted on federal charges related to the possession of child pornography, which activists say is better labeled “child sexual abuse materials” (CSAM), as it does not imply consent.  It was then that the public was reminded of the reason behind the Duggars’ first fall from grace that led to the cancellation of their initial series — when In Touch Weekly uncovered police reports in May 2015 that revealed Josh had molested his sisters in the past. Two of the eldest Duggar girls and their parents spoke to Megyn Kelly following the incident noting that they forgave Josh and that the incident was in the past, but critiques surrounding the initial reporting of the incident emerged and have only become more pronounced after a witness testified during Josh’s December 2021 trial to a pattern of abusive behavior in his youth. When the news of Josh’s 2021 charges broke, the r/DuggarsSnark subreddit had 80,000 subscribers. Now that he’s been found guilty, the subreddit has more than 130,000 subscribers. The subreddit’s five moderators have been busy, but they found time to speak to In The Know about the role the subreddit has played in the trial and in the critique of purity culture at large.  APW25, who joined the moderation team just before the legal proceedings officially began, said the community “has broken down the trial in such a way that anyone could follow along without feeling stupid.” Users freely asked questions, and legal experts (like moderator and law student nuggetsofchicken) attempted to answer them. “We covered aspects of the proceedings that wouldn’t make headlines. A response to a response to a motion isn’t really a great cover story for PEOPLE, but it was cool for us to read what direction each side seemed to be trying to take the narrative,” nuggetsofchicken explained.  The subreddit is rife with in-jokes that only insiders with a wide knowledge of Duggar lore would be able to understand right off the bat, but that just proves the sense of community that has developed among Duggar snarkers.  As further proof the subreddit isn’t just there to poke fun at celebrities or gawk at a sensational trial, members helped raise more than $12,000 for the Children’s Safety Center in Northwest Arkansas, which empowers children to overcome abuse. The center received so many donations, it filled up a mail truck with Amazon packages, and had to repeatedly replenish the wish list because it kept being bought out. Dismantling purity culture and the future of r/DuggarsSnark The trial may be over, but r/DuggarsSnark’s work isn’t done. Many members of the Duggar family still adhere to the same patriarchal standards that treat women and girls as vehicles for temptation and shame those who have “lost” their sexual purity that it makes it difficult for victims of abuse to come forward. In a TikTok video shared to r/DuggarSnark as well as r/FundieSnarkUncensored and r/ExMormon, a woman who provides resources to people working through their religious trauma explained how pedophilia and purity culture can sometimes go hand-in-hand.  “Some of the standards of purity culture are innocence, which pretty much means ignorance about sex; submission, which for women means submission to men; virginity as the ultimate standard of worth; and modesty, which for women means that we are not allowed to wear anything that reveals our adult curves,” TikTok user Jo Luehmann said. “Purity culture makes the desirable standard a child. It makes child-likeness desirable in regards to sexuality.”  She clarified that, of course, not every man raised in purity culture is a pedophile. It just attempts to rewire the brain to desire childlike qualities and makes it a lot easier for pedophiles to have access to people with such qualities.  Purity culture also discourages comprehensive sex education, which makes it challenging for young people to discern what’s appropriate and what isn’t. It also shames people for sexual thoughts or behaviors, which makes people who might be vulnerable feel afraid to speak up about possible abuse.  “Dismantle absurd notions that virginity and worth are connected,” Luehmann continued. “Women inside fundamentalist Christianity are also expected to rely on men financially while they are out in the world and not to get a formal education. They are expected to be grown children … if we really want to protect women and children, purity culture has to go.”  Moderator nuggetsofchicken said purity culture comes up a lot on r/DuggarSnark, even if it isn’t explicitly called that, because “so much of the Duggar show and livelihood was built on that core value.” “The original [Duggar] show showed very little of the older boys but very much highlighted the older girls. ​​The topics thus naturally gravitated to discussions on purity because the girls had very few other defining interests, and I’m sure their parents thought that their chastity would be a great thing to highlight [in order] to minister to people,” they explained. “But it’s such an obsession. Someone once described the show as, ‘I have never seen people who talk about sex this much who don’t actually talk about sex.’”     A post shared by Jessa Seewald (@jessaseewald) Estesparkranger noted that Josh’s case is “dripping with the effects of purity culture.” “I could write a dissertation on how the beliefs [that] the Duggars held directly impacted Josh and Josh’s victims. Sexual desires are repressed, physical and emotional punishments are used as a means of controlling sexual desire,” they said. “If a woman or girl is violated, the blame goes to the woman for evoking ‘desires that cannot be righteously fulfilled.’ The Duggars believe this. They teach and preach this.” The moderators and snarkers of r/DuggarSnark don’t see any problem with poking fun at the family because they believe the Duggars have truly harmful beliefs. Though the elder Duggar sisters have gained respect from members for their resilience in facing their abuser, the subreddit still isn’t for fans. In fact, there’s a comprehensive guide as to why each of the Duggar kids still “suck,” from anti-LGBTQIA statements to child endangerment to sexism. Moderator larakf critiqued the Duggars and other fundamentalist Christians for living “prescriptive lifestyles” that demand others assimilate to their own religious beliefs.  “At the end of the day, these are cult members AND public figures. By nature of being a public figure, people become fans,” they told In The Know. “We find it in our human nature to call out ideas and beliefs we don’t agree with … [and] that’s what the snarking is about. It exposes who these people are for what they believe.” Nuggetsofchicken noted that snark can help dismantle oppressive belief systems from a “purely capitalistic standpoint,” too.  “If the Duggars face enough public ridicule, it significantly limits their opportunity to profit from TV shows, books, sponsorships, etc,” they said. At the end of the day, the five r/DuggarsSnark moderators oversee the subreddit because they know it’s important. It’s fun making fun of the patriarch’s hairpiece, sure, but it can make all the difference for survivors and people who don’t even realize what beliefs have been passed down to them. “It’s just funny. It’s always fun to mock people who operate outside of our existing schemes of how people ‘should’ be behaving in the world,” nuggetsofchicken said. “It’s for sure a coping mechanism for many and helps take back some of the sting of what they’ve experienced in that kind of religious institution.” “I think there’s value in calling out problematic behavior for the victims involved,” they added. “It’s sort of a meme-y way of reminding victims that ‘what happened to you is not OK.’” If you or someone you know needs support after experiencing sexual violence, contact the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) at 1-800-656-4673 or chat online with a trained counselor. You can also connect with a Crisis Text Line counselor at no charge by texting the word “HOME” to 741741.

12/16/2021,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Another storm pushed into California on Wednesday as the state cleaned up from a powerful weather system that coated mountains with much-needed snow and set rainfall records in the drought-stricken state. The new storm was expected to impact Northern California with widespread rain, gusty winds and snowfall in coastal mountains and the Sierra Nevada, where the snowpack normally supplies about 30% of the state's water needs. The latest tempest followed on the heels of a multiday atmospheric river — a long plume of moisture from the Pacific Ocean that delivered remarkable rainfall, including more than 11 inches (28 centimeters) over 72 hours at Mount Tamalpais, north of San Francisco. By Tuesday afternoon, 8.1 inches (20 centimeters) of rain had fallen in one area of the central coast's Santa Barbara County. Downtown Los Angeles got 2.16 inches (5.4 centimeters), more than doubling the date's old record set in 1888. More than 4.6 inches (11.8 centimeters) fell within 24 hours in Orange County’s Silverado Canyon, south of LA, where sheriff’s deputies rescued residents after mud inundated homes in the area scarred by wildfires. No injuries were reported. Firefighters searched the surging Los Angeles River on Tuesday after discovering two submerged vehicles wedged against a bridge pillar south of downtown LA and learning that a third vehicle had been swept past the bridge. No victims, if any, were immediately located and firefighters were waiting for the water level to fall. “The circumstances surrounding these three separate vehicles and their journey down the LA River remain unclear,” a Fire Department statement said. Earlier, a man was rescued after being swept into a covered stream channel in the San Fernando Valley. The man called for help on his cellphone and firefighters reached him through a maintenance hole on the street above. He suffered bruises and hypothermia, fire officials said. The storm prompted officials to shut down a 40-mile (64-kilometer) stretch of the iconic Highway 1 in the Big Sur area to repair damage and clean up rocks in lanes. The coastal route south of the San Francisco Bay Area got more than a foot (30 centimeters) of rain in 24 hours. It frequently experiences damage during wet weather. The storm began over the weekend in Northern California and brought heavy precipitation as far inland as Nevada, where more than 6 feet (1.8 meters) of snow fell at the Mt. Rose ski resort just southwest of Reno. Avalanche warnings were in effect in the Mono and Inyo county areas of California's eastern Sierra. Residents near the Alisal Fire burn scar in Santa Barbara County were ordered to evacuate over concerns that heavy rains might cause flooding and debris flows. The order was lifted Tuesday afternoon. Similar orders were issued for people living near burn scars in the San Bernardino Mountains east of Los Angeles, where rockslides were reported. A mountain route into the resort town of Big Bear was closed until Wednesday morning while crews cleared several feet of mud and debris. It was too soon to know how much of a dent the rain would make in the state's drought. The system built on the progress of a massive rain storm in October, particularly in Northern California, said Michael Anderson, the state climatologist. Heavy rains moistened the ground, which will ensure more water stays packed in the snow, he said. Last year, the mountain snow lost a lot of moisture into the ground because it was so dry, he said. December, January and February are typically the wettest months of the year in California; about half of the state’s annual precipitation falls in that window, he said. If storms don’t continue through the winter, the effect of this storm on the drought will be “muted,” Anderson said. Any moisture is much-needed in the broader region that’s been gripped by drought that scientists have said is caused by climate change. The latest U.S. drought monitor shows parts of Montana, Oregon, California, Nevada, and Utah are classified as being in exceptional drought, which is the worst category. ___ Associated Press writers Christopher Weber and Robert Jablon in Los Angeles; Terence Chea in Oakland, California; Janie Har in San Francisco; Kathleen Ronayne in Sacramento, California; and Scott Sonner in Reno, Nevada contributed to this report.",U.S./Associated Press,Another storm heading into already drenched California,https://news.yahoo.com/california-cleans-powerful-storm-drenches-051611960.html
