12/11/2021,"After a breakdown in the broadcasting of the first Ashes Test normal service eventually resumed, England’s meek collapse on the fourth morning in the face of a rejuvenated Australian attack condemning them to a nine-wicket defeat and a 1-0 series deficit head into the pink ball encounter in Adelaide.As Marcus Harris and Marnus Labuschagne finished off a target of 20 runs in 25 minutes after lunch, the latter striding in after the fall of the promoted Alex Carey, it condemned England to their 10th defeat in their last 11 Tests, handed Pat Cummins a first victory as captain and restored the Gabba’s status as Australia’s fortress.  They may have lost to India on the ground back in January, but England? This was a seventh victory over the old enemy in their last nine encounters in Queensland as part of an unbeaten Ashes record that stretches back to 1986. ‘Gabbattoir’ references have thankfully been light over the past week but it still deals in butchery. No wonder Cricket Australia were so keen to start this unique Ashes series on Vulture Street, despite the logistical issues thrown up by the pandemic and Queensland’s hard border. These led to a lack of engineers and technicians on the ground, with the third umpiring technology reduced throughout and even the television pictures dropping out for 25 minutes during what proved the final morning. As it happened this gap in transmission did well not to miss a wicket on a morning that saw England lose eight of them for 77 in 33 overs and bowled out for 297. This wasn’t a rushing cascade of dismissals, rather the slow, inevitable decline of a batting line-up that has regularly crumbled all year. Once Dawid Malan had become Nathan Lyon’s 400th Test victim on 82, and Joe Root edged a beautiful outswinger from Cameron Green on 89, resistance proved worryingly fleeting. This will be a match that leaves plenty of regret for England to stew over during the next four days. Even considering their meltdown on that electric opening day, rolled for 147 inside two sessions after Mitchell Starc bullseyed Rory Burns’ leg stump first ball, and the squandering of the best bowling conditions at the toss, England carved out openings that could have set up a first innings versus fourth innings contest. On the second evening they reduced Australia to 195 for five, their lead just 48 at that stage, only for Travis Head to ignite the afterburners with 152 runs from No 5 that feasted on a weary, undercooked seam attack and continued the misery for Jack Leach. This intervention swelled the first innings difference into 278 runs and defeat inside three days could easily have followed for England. But the tourists then mustered a further fightback, one that saw them head into day four on 220 for two, with Root and Malan closing in on centuries that, along with further runs down the order, could have given their bowlers a workable target to defend. Instead Australia, though once again lacking the presence of Warner in the field after a rib injury and with concerns over the fitness of Josh Hazlewood, crucially struck three times for 14 runs during their 10-over wait for the second new ball. It began with a moment to savour for Lyon. The offspinner had spent 326 days stranded on 399 Test victims - it might have been 325 had Australia reviewed a gloved catch off Malan when on 37 the previous afternoon - but the return of close fielders to generate some early pressure told, Malan’s attempted flick after dancing down the pitch ballooning off his pad to give Labuschagne a simple catch at silly mid-off. With Root than undone by some late movement from Green, the hunt for a first century on Australian soil thwarted at the 19th attempt, and Ollie Pope’s skittish time against Lyon ended on four when a cramped and injudicious cut shot flew to slip, England were 234 for five, still 44 runs in arrears and with a brand new Kookaburra looming. Then came the blackout in pictures, during which time Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler seemingly managed to get themselves in to chisel the deficit down to 12 runs. But, as has so often been the case, Cummins delivered the breakthrough, extra bounce twisting up Stokes on 14 as a catch flew to gully, with Hazlewood gritting his teeth through the pain of an unspecified injury and removing Buttler caught behind on 23. Thereafter the tail folded once more, the only cheers from the smattering of England supporters being ironic ones when it was confirmed Australia would bat again and Lyon picking up two more wickets. When Carey held his eighth catch behind the stumps, Chris Woakes a second victim to the giant Green on 16, it equalled the record number of dismissals for a wicketkeeper on debut one and set up the meagre target. Carey didn’t quite get a fairytale finish thereafter, nicking behind off Ollie Robinson when deputising for the stricken Warner. “We couldn’t find him,” joked Cummins at the presentation. “We looked everywhere in the stadium. [But] he is fine, we just didn’t want to risk him and he will be alright for Adelaide.” Whether England will be after their latest Gabba misfire remains to be seen.",Sport/Sport,Australia demolish England by nine wickets in first Ashes Test | Ali Martin,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/11/ashes-gabba-england-australia-first-test-match-report-root-stokes-buttler-lyon-starc-carey
12/11/2021,"In the January of 2020 the world was a different place. The Australian men’s Test team had burned through a home summer against Pakistan and New Zealand - double centuries, triple centuries, innings victories, the works. Nathan Lyon, Australia’s off-spinner, finished it in style in the Sydney Test. Five wickets in the first innings, five in the second, 10 for 113 in the match, 27 for the season, and up to 390 in his career. Just around the corner lay 400, that huge milestone that at the time had only been passed by 15 players. Then of course the world was turned upside down. Australia’s next Test engagement against Bangladesh was cancelled, a place where Lyon took 22 wickets in two matches on his previous visit. Not in any overseas T20 leagues, he spent the winter cooling his heels. He played three Sheffield Shield matches towards the end of the year with plenty of overs returning nine wickets for 392 runs. Then it was into a series against India, the specialists against spin.  Abruptly, the charge to 390 stalled. In Adelaide he got one in the first innings and didn’t get to bowl in the second, as the fast bowlers tore through India for 36 runs. In Melbourne he cleaned up the tail for 3 for 72, but featured less than three overs second time around as India strolled a small chase to win. Sydney was where things really came apart: 31 fruitless overs in the first innings, even as India made a modest score, then 41 overs in the fourth innings, bowling through the final day but striking only twice, allowing India to escape with a draw. That meant 396 wickets coming into the series finale in Brisbane. One more in the first innings, tricking the opener Rohit Sharma in flight. Then once more the fourth innings, a big lead, an expected victory, and the tables being turned, India making 329 to win. Lyon got a slip catch and a chop-on, 31 overs for two wickets, a series loss, and a career tally of 399. The year to follow panned out like the one before. Australia cited the pandemic in cancelling three Tests in South Africa, not Lyon’s happiest hunting ground but another opportunity lost. No other tours were scheduled in its place. Another winter of sitting around, sorting the button box by colour and size, watching macrame tutorials on YouTube. It’s not as though Lyon had spent a lot of actual Test matches with 399 hanging over him, but he had spent nearly two years. So the number was there when the Ashes began in Brisbane - not quite a monkey on the back, but perhaps a lemur on the shoulder. It grew more simian on the first day - a day for the fast bowlers, yes, with cloud cover and English wickets tumbling in the gloom, but also a sufficiently limp batting performance that a spinner bowling nine overs would expect to pick up at least one frazzled shot to a catcher. No such luck. None for 21. As the third innings unfolded, the monkey started combing through the stubble on Lyon’s head for snacks. The first two wickets fell, but not to the spinner. He was brought on to target Dawid Malan, turning the ball sharply across the left-hander but never taking the edge. Then Malan settled in for the rest of the day with Joe Root. The pair cut and pulled Lyon when he dropped short, came down the wicket to drive him, swept him off a length. He was bowling faster, flatter, than his best. Marnus Labuschagne’s part-time spin came on. Lyon finished the day with no wicket for 69, having bowled 24 overs. Well after the fact, the television cameras realised that a ball that had bounced back to the bowler off Malan’s pad had also hit the batter’s glove on the way. It would have been wicket 400, but there was barely an appeal. And so onto day four. The partnership up to 162, in the fourth over of the morning. The flight was there, the loop, some turn. An inside edge into Malan’s ankle, a deflection to the catcher under the batter’s nose. Monkey returned to the wild, ball held aloft to the crowd from among the white-clad throng. Just because numbers are arbitrary doesn’t mean they don’t mean anything. From there, things quickly broke Lyon’s way. Ollie Pope charged and swiped towards cover only to get an edge to slip. England were still behind Australia’s first innings on runs. Lyon had a break as the visitors kept sliding. He returned for Ollie Robinson to play a reverse sweep to backward point, then for Mark Wood to miss a straight ball aimed at his stumps. The stagnation of 399 had quickly given way to 403, Lyon now one of 17 in that club having been preceded to it by his Indian peer Ravichandran Ashwin. With four Tests to go, it is time to start towards the next number. For a spin bowler having just turned 34, the ambitions on that front need not be modest. The last two years may have been dry, but in Brisbane, the rains can come suddenly and fast.",Sport/Sport,Nathan Lyon spins his way into the 400 club – eventually | Geoff Lemon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/11/nathan-lyon-spins-his-way-into-the-400-club-eventually
