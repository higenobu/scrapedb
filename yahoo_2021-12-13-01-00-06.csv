12/13/2021,"ELLIOTT, Iowa (AP) — A coalition of California restaurants and grocery stores has filed a lawsuit to block implementation of a new farm animal welfare law, adding to uncertainty about whether bacon and other fresh pork products will be much more expensive or in short supply in the state when the new rules take effect on New Year's Day. The lawsuit is the latest step in a tumultuous three-year process of enacting rules overwhelmingly approved by voters but that remain in question even as the law is set to begin. Since voters approved Proposition 12 by a 2-to-1 ratio in November 2018, state officials have missed deadlines for releasing specific regulations covering the humane treatment of animals that provide meat for the California market. Most hog producers haven't made changes to comply with the law. And now a coalition of business owners is seeking more than a two-year delay. “We’re saying this is not going to work,” said Nate Rose, a spokesman for the California Grocers Association. While groups are working to delay the measure, the state has eased the transition to the new system. It has allowed pork processed under the old rules and held in cold storage to be sold in California in 2022, which could prevent shortages for weeks or even months. As Josh Boak, who leads farm animal protection efforts at the Humane Society of the United States, put it, California residents need not fear “pork industry claims of the apocalypse."" Put simply, the law requires that breeding pigs, egg-laying chickens and veal calves be given enough space to stand and turn around. For pigs, that means they no longer can be kept in narrow ""gestation crates"" and must have 24 square feet (2.23 square meters) of usable space. Producers of eggs and veal appear able to meet the new law, but hog farmers argued the changes would be too expensive and couldn’t be carried out until the state approved final regulations for the new standards. An estimate from North Carolina State University found the new standard would cost about 15% more per animal for a farm with 1,000 breeding pigs. The National Pork Producers Council has challenged California's right to impose standards on businesses in other states, but so far those efforts have failed. California is the nation’s largest market for pork, and producers in major hog states like Iowa provide more than 80% of the roughly 255 million pounds (115 million kilograms) that California’s restaurants and groceries use each month, according to Rabobank, a global food and agriculture financial services company. Without that supply, it’s unclear if a state that consumes about 13% of the nation's pork supply will have all the meat it demands. The North American Meat Institute, an industry group, said packers and processors “will do their best to serve the California market."" “What will happen in California? I don’t know,” said Michael Formica, the general counsel for the National Pork Producers Council. “One thing we know is there will be finite supplies to sell there.” Adding to the uncertainty is the lawsuit filed last month in Sacramento County by the California Grocers Association, California Restaurant Association, California Hispanic Chambers of Commerce, California Retailers Association and Kruse & Sons, a meat processor. The suit seeks a 28-month delay until final regulations for enforcement of the rules are officially adopted. California's agriculture and health departments have said the voter-backed measure didn't give them enough time to approve final regulations. The agencies were still accepting public comments for revisions in December. That means it could be months before final rules are approved. Given that delay, the groups claim in the lawsuit that they can't be sure they're complying and could be subject to penalties stipulated in the law. “Our concern is the uncertainty,” said Rose, of the grocers association. He said a judge has scheduled a hearing for March, but the group is pushing for an earlier date. If the law takes effect Jan. 1, it’s possible the state could avoid immediate shortages or steep price increases because the industry has about 466 million pounds (211 million kilograms) of pork in storage. Not all of that meat can be sent to California, of course, but when combined with new supplies from processors that meet the new standards, it should meet at least some of the demand. If there is a disruption, it “would be significantly smoothed,” said Daniel Sumner, a professor at the University of California-Davis, who teamed with colleagues to study the price and supply implications of Proposition 12. While an earlier study projected bacon prices soaring by up to 60% in California, a UC-Davis report estimated that the uncooked pork prices rising eventually by a more manageable 8% in California. Massachusetts has approved a similar animal welfare law that takes effect next month, but state lawmakers are considering a one-year delay because of supply concerns. The accuracy of the California estimates could depend on how many farmers adopt the new standards and how long the transition takes. Iowa farmer Ron Mardesen already meets the California standards, and for much of the year gives sows free rein to roam through large areas of his farm about 100 miles (160 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines. With so much room, “They’re like a bunch of big, old sisters,” he said. “You can tell they’re happy. No one is squealing or crying.” Chris Oliviero, general manager of Niman Ranch, a specialty meat company in Westminster, Colorado, said he hopes California’s new rules help change a system he calls “lower cost at any cost.” Although Niman charges more for its pork, he said he hopes the new California rules help limit the environmental consequences of large-scale animal agriculture. “There is volatility in the markets, so I understand the fears that comes with that, but I also think most large agricultural companies have shown that when they put their mind to it they’re very capable of solving complex problems,” Oliviero said. ___ Follow Scott McFetridge on Twitter: https://twitter.com/smcfetridge ___ This story has been updated to correct the amount of pork consumed in California and the amount in cold storage.",U.S./Associated Press,Will new bacon law begin?

Fox News Media said in a statement, “We are extremely proud of our journalism and the stellar team that Chris Wallace was a part of for 18 years. The legacy of Fox News Sunday will continue with our star journalists, many of whom will rotate in the position until a permanent host is named.” Wallace, 74, has been one of the network’s highest profile hosts, known for his hard-hitting interviews on both sides of the aisle. But he also has been a target of President Donald Trump, including after Wallace moderated the first presidential debate last year. That event turned into a chaotic event, as Trump repeatedly interrupted Joe Biden. Wallace later acknowledged that it went a bit off the rails. But his interviews with newsmakers often drew praise for their preparation and for his followups, including when Wallace interviewed Trump in July, 2020. The then-president at times took to Twitter to blast Wallace. Since Trump’s defeat last year, Fox News has tried to consolidate the audience on the right, bumping newscasts from the nighttime hours in favor of more talking head opinion hosts. Tucker Carlson, more than any other figure, has triggered ongoing controversies, most recently over a Fox Nation documentary that advanced the theory that the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol was a false flag operation. More recently, Jewish groups called for an apology after Lara Logan, a Fox Nation host, guested on Fox News Primetime and compared Anthony Fauci to Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. In interviews, Wallace has tried to distance himself from the opinion side of the network. In his on air remarks on Sunday, he said, “Eighteen years ago, the bosses here at Fox promised me they would never interfere with a guest I booked or a question I asked. And they kept that promise. I have been free to report to the best of my ability, to cover the stories I think are important, to hold our country’s leaders to account.” Wallace’s announcement was a surprise. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) tweeted, “Shocked to hear that Chris Wallace is leaving #FoxNewsSunday. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time on the show. Chris challenged everyone fairly and tried to give his viewers the best information to evaluate issues.” Wallace signed a multi-year contract in 2017 to remain at the network past the most recent presidential election.

12/13/2021,"A double-vaccinated woman has caught COVID-19 after a lab mouse bit her, say reports. Taiwan has not seen any community cases of the virus in over a month. The technician took trains and buses, shopped, and dined out before testing positive despite feeling sick. A laboratory worker in Taiwan has caught COVID-19 after being bitten by an infected mouse, according to reports. Taiwan's health officials are still to establish, without doubt, that she caught the virus as a direct result of the rodent bite, The Guardian reported. Taiwan has not seen any community transmission of COVID-19 for over a month. ""We believe the possibility of infection from the workplace is higher because we have zero confirmed infections in the community,"" the health minister, Chen Shih-chung, said, per The Guardian. As part of experiments at Academia Sinica, Taiwan's leading research institute in Taipei, the rodent was infected with the virus. After being bitten twice by an infected mouse, the double-vaccinated woman tested positive for the Delta variant of COVID-19 on Thursday. Despite feeling sick, the woman traveled by trains and buses, went shopping, and dined out for several days before testing positive, said The Times. This case has given traction to speculation that the pandemic could have been caused by a lab accident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in China, a theory that The Office of the Director of National Intelligence says is a plausible explanation for the pandemic outbreak. Yanzhong Huang, a Chinese public health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, said that should it be confirmed that the Taiwanese researcher did catch COVID-19 due to the rodent bite, then ""this will add credibility to the lab leak theory."" ""This case comes as we have reached an impasse on the origins probe for COVID-19, with no progress on establishing whether the outbreak was the result of a natural spillover from animals or a lab leak,"" he told The Times.

12/13/2021,"By Andrew Osborn and Andrey Ostroukh MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin has lamented the collapse of the Soviet Union three decades ago as the demise of what he called ""historical Russia"" and said the economic crisis that followed was so bad he was forced to moonlight as a taxi driver. Putin's comments, released by state TV on Sunday, are likely to further fuel speculation about his foreign policy intentions among his critics, who accuse him of planning to recreate the Soviet Union and of contemplating an attack on Ukraine, a notion the Kremlin has dismissed as fear-mongering. ""It was a disintegration of historical Russia under the name of the Soviet Union,"" Putin said of the 1991 breakup, in comments aired on Sunday as part of a documentary film called ""Russia. New History"", the RIA state news agency reported. Putin also described for the first time how he was affected personally by the tough economic times that followed the Soviet collapse, when Russia suffered double-digit inflation. ""Sometimes (I) had to moonlight and drive a taxi. It is unpleasant to talk about this but, unfortunately, this also took place,"" the president said. Putin, who served in the Soviet-era KGB, has previously called the collapse of the Soviet Union, which was ruled from Moscow, as the ""greatest geopolitical catastrophe"" of the 20th century, but his new comments show how he viewed it specifically as a setback for Russian power. Ukraine was one of 15 Soviet republics and Putin used an article of more than 5,000 words published on the Kremlin website this year to set out why he believed Russia's southern neighbour and its people were an integral part of Russian history and culture. This view is rejected by Kyiv as a politically motivated and over-simplified version of history. The West has accused Russia of massing tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine in preparation for a possible attack as soon as January, and the Group of Seven wealthy democracies was set to warn Moscow on Sunday of massive consequences and severe costs if it attacked Ukraine. The Kremlin has said Russia has no plans to launch a fresh attack on Ukraine and that the West appears to have convinced itself of Moscow's aggressive intentions based on what it calls false Western media stories. Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014 and has backed separatists who took control of a swath of eastern Ukraine that same year and continue to fight Ukrainian government forces.

12/13/2021,"Supply-chain issues have sent the price of used cars soaring for much of the last two years. Since people can't find the new cars they're looking for, they're flocking to the used market. Some particularly in-demand models from Tesla, Toyota, and GM are now worth more used than new. Supply-chain issues have slammed coveted goods from cream cheese to cars. Shortages have hit the US vehicle market so hard, in fact, that bizarre things have started happening. Amid a dwindling supply of new cars, used vehicles have experienced record price increases over the last year and a half. Moreover, things are so out of whack that more than a dozen models now cost more to buy lightly used than new, according to a November study from automotive research site iSeeCars. This has been happening for months now, but iSeeCars has identified the 15 models that are experiencing this sort of backward pricing as of November. The issue here is that new versions of popular vehicles have become increasingly scarce on dealer lots. Rather than suffer through a long wait for a brand-new vehicle, buyers are paying top dollar for slightly older ones with some mileage. For some particularly popular models, that means shelling out above MSRP. While this doesn't bode well for buyers, it's great news for sellers. If you bought one of the identified models in the last couple of years, you may be in the perfect position to make thousands by selling your vehicle privately or to a dealer. iSeeCars analyzed more than 1 million new and used cars listed for sale during the first half of November. It compared the asking prices for new vehicles (2021 and 2022 models) with the asking prices for lightly used ones (2020 and 2021 models with between 10,780 and 16,171 miles on the odometer). See the full list of 15 models below: Average price new: $56,685 Average price used: $64,930 Difference: $8,245, 14.5% (Because Tesla sells directly to consumers, iSeeCars estimated new Tesla prices based on their MSRP and the distribution of trims on the used market.)

12/13/2021,"Nicole Jacobson was far from home and feeling alone, placed by the Peace Corps in a remote village in Zambia with a host father who had five wives and a disturbing interest in the young American volunteer. The man routinely leered at her while touching himself, Jacobson said. He grabbed and groped her, once bursting into her hut and pushing her up against the wall. Yet when she called Peace Corps staff to report him, Jacobson said, staff repeatedly dismissed her concerns. “According to them, I just didn't understand the situation,” she said, adding that one Peace Corps staff member told her, “It just means he likes you.” Jacobson said staff left her there for more than a year before pulling her from the site in 2018. Now, she and other volunteers who shared their experiences earlier this year in a USA TODAY investigation worry officials are about to place more volunteers at risk as the Peace Corps rushes to reestablish volunteers abroad after service was shut down in March 2020. The agency is poised to send a new class of recruits into the field as soon as January, but an outside review ordered in response to USA TODAY’s investigation found the agency still lacks a comprehensive plan to prevent them from being sexually assaulted. The Sexual Assault Advisory Council, a panel of specialists tapped by the Peace Corps, recommended the agency hire a violence prevention specialist and called for “a new culture that prioritizes prevention as well as response, strengthens accountability and transparency, and conducts all sexual assault programming using trauma-informed approaches.” USA TODAY’s investigation found forcible sexual assaults and rapes disclosed by volunteers at the end of their service nearly doubled from 2015 to 2019. At the same time, the agency knowingly placed volunteers in dangerous situations and inflicted more trauma by bungling its response to volunteer assaults, USA TODAY found. In the months since, Peace Corps officials have pledged a litany of reforms and hired a consultant to evaluate the structure of its sexual assault program – a separate assessment from the council’s review. Carol Spahn, the agency's chief executive, said in a statement that she and other agency leaders are committed to doing “everything we can to prevent sexual violence and to provide a compassionate response when it does occur.” She and other agency officials declined repeated interview requests. In the statement, they said staff would analyze the council's recommendations and release a formal response and plan in early 2022. In the meantime, agency officials said they've made changes to enhance volunteer safety. But many of USA TODAY’s findings and the recommendations from the council’s review — as well as the pledges to fix the shortfalls — mirror those that have been raised before, fueling skepticism among volunteers like Jacobson that Peace Corps officials are serious about revamping the storied institution. “I just think it's a lot of talk,” Jacobson said. “They're kind of trying to do whatever the bare minimum is to make the story go away and to make the exposure go away,” said former volunteer Amanda Moses, who was sexually assaulted in Kyrgystan in 2017 on a bus where another volunteer had previously reported being sexually assaulted. “It's like pulling teeth to get one thing, one little initiative.” Even as the council directed the agency to “improve transparency and communication,” Peace Corps officials have declined to provide key details to USA TODAY about the fixes it has promised, delaying and denying requests for information and referring questions to the agency’s Freedom of Information Act Office. Spahn had pledged increased transparency following USA TODAY’s investigation. Each year, the Peace Corps, a federal agency, deploys thousands of Americans, mostly young women, around the globe. The agency is tasked with vetting where those volunteers live and work during their two years of service, providing medical care and supporting those who are victims of crimes. USA TODAY revealed in its investigation that 44% of women who finished service in 2019 were sexually assaulted in some way, ranging from groping to rape. The analysis also found that reporting rates for forcible sexual assault and rape have remained relatively stagnant in recent years, indicating that volunteers are being assaulted more frequently – and not just growing more comfortable coming forward to report what happened. A dozen former volunteers who served between 2016 and 2020 shared their experiences with USA TODAY. Reporters corroborated many of their accounts with agency records, contemporaneous messages and interviews with fellow volunteers. One described being sexually assaulted by a Peace Corps-selected doctor in Ecuador whom another volunteer had already reported for inappropriate behavior. Another woman told USA TODAY Peace Corps officials fabricated details in official documents after she reported being raped while serving in Guatemala, writing that she had initially consented to sexual contact with her attacker. A third, Fellina Fucci, said that after a man in her Samoan village raped her, a Peace Corps safety and security manager questioned her memory, chastised her for not using a rape whistle during the attack and told her the assailant was a friend of his who would likely gossip about her. “I spent more time during my trauma therapy discussing the Peace Corps staff’s response to my assault rather than the assault itself,” Fucci said.

In the months since USA TODAY’s report, the agency said it has created staff positions in each country to ensure crimes are documented and reviewed before volunteers are placed; improved screening and training of host families and colleagues; and required in-country staff to conduct formal case reviews of every assault. The agency also will now allow volunteers to review summaries of their crime reports – after several women told USA TODAY they found inaccuracies in official records. Spahn asked the agency’s inspector general to investigate what happened in the cases highlighted by USA TODAY. In a report released earlier this month, the inspector general said investigators had finished reviewing one woman’s case. They did not find evidence staff violated policies but found errors in how the sexual assault was documented. The report said reviews of the other cases are ongoing. After receiving inquiries from USA TODAY, agency officials said they referred an additional case for investigation: Jacobson's. Members of Congress – who in 2011 and 2018 passed reform packages after volunteers decried substandard care they received while abroad – responded to USA TODAY’s reporting with alarm. “There’s no excuse for inaction over the years,” said Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., the only former Peace Corps volunteer serving in Congress. Garamendi, who said he anticipates current agency leadership will make the necessary changes, is pushing legislation to increase the agency’s funding and expand its volunteer ranks. At a September hearing on the bill, Rep. Scott Perry, R-Penn., questioned any such move until the agency does more to protect volunteers. “It’s abundantly clear that the Peace Corps has a systemic problem regarding assault,” he said after entering USA TODAY’s investigation into the congressional record. “It's disgusting to read about it. I would not want my daughters to go to the Peace Corps, I'm going to tell you that right now. It is a betrayal of the highest order.” The agency, meanwhile, is moving forward with plans to send volunteers back into the field and has invited new recruits to begin service in five countries with start dates ranging from January to March “so long as conditions allow,” the Peace Corps said in a recent newsletter. They are Belize, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Zambia, with plans to add more later in 2022. If the timeline holds, the Peace Corps will deploy volunteers without having resolved numerous safety recommendations from its inspector general, completed the ongoing review of its sexual assault program or finished weighing the council’s directives – among other fixes. Sue Castle, whose son died after receiving inadequate medical care from a Peace Corps doctor while volunteering in China in 2013, said the COVID shutdown has been a “perfect opportunity” for the agency to revamp its sexual assault policies but that she does not think that’s happened. She called it “irresponsible” for the agency to redeploy volunteers now. At least once a year, Castle travels to Washington D.C. to meet with lawmakers and agency officials about improvements needed to the agency. In 2018, Congress passed a law named after her son Nick that enhanced medical care for volunteers and expanded on earlier legislation pertaining to sexual assault. She said it was heartbreaking to read the accounts shared by USA TODAY. “It's very frustrating for me. My son, it was poor medical care. Other people, it's sexual assault,” she said. “They need to do better and they can do better. I don't know why they don't.” Before last month, the agency’s Sexual Assault Advisory Council, which is made up of nearly a dozen experts in violence prevention and response as well as former volunteers, had not issued a public report in five years. Spahn, in response to USA TODAY’s investigation, asked the council to examine whether the agency had implemented recommendations by prior councils since 2015. The resulting report in its top conclusions highlights the lack of a comprehensive sexual assault prevention plan – a deficiency the council first flagged in 2015. At the time, the Peace Corps developed a flow chart that directs staff in each country to develop policies for home and work site selection as well as “crime action plans” where assault rates are high. In its most recent report, the council said relying on crime action plans for each country is not enough. It recommended the Peace Corps set measurable goals for success, hone a strategy that spans every level of the agency and develop a global core training for volunteer host families and coworkers that “emphasizes unwanted attention, violence prevention, and bystander intervention.” The panel also found staff is not doing enough to support volunteers after they are assaulted, echoing USA TODAY’s findings. For example, Peace Corps medical officers are required to complete a 90-minute online training session on conducting sexual assault exams that is “inadequate” and “minimally relevant,” the group said. Addressing that shortfall – which the council said it also flagged in 2015, 2019 and 2020 – is “critical to ensure the safety and well-being of sexual assault survivors,” the council concluded. The council said all Peace Corps staff should be trained annually in trauma-informed responses to sexual assault. Peace Corps officials told USA TODAY the agency is expanding training of medical and other staff. The council’s chair, Elizabeth Arlotti-Parish, who works as a senior adviser at Jhpiego, a global healthcare nonprofit affiliated with Johns Hopkins University, declined interview requests and referred inquiries to the Peace Corps. Kellie Greene, who was hired by the Peace Corps nearly a decade ago to be its first victim advocate, said many problems identified in the new advisory council report have been raised before, including by her. Greene, who left the agency in 2016 after filing a whistleblower complaint alleging the Peace Corps wasn’t doing enough to protect volunteers, said inaction since has led to unnecessary volunteer trauma. “As the Peace Corps prepares to return volunteers to the field, they must focus on how to prevent sexual assaults and demonstrate loyalty towards volunteers,” she said. “I know the Peace Corps has the ability to be a leader in the field of sexual assault. It can do better and must.” As the agency analyzes the new recommendations, it has yet to close out more than a dozen others from the Peace Corps inspector general that were issued years ago. They include directives – one dating to 2013 – designed to prevent placing volunteers in known danger, ensure adequate medical staffing, and to track staff training on sexual assault. Peace Corps officials said they are working to address the outstanding recommendations. They said some cannot be resolved until volunteers return to the field but didn’t say which and declined to explain what remains to be done. On multiple fronts, the Peace Corps has declined to provide information that would provide a deeper understanding of sexual assaults experienced by volunteers and what the agency is doing to address the problem. It declined to provide details or documentation backing up claims that it has strengthened numerous policies to protect volunteers and referred requests to the Freedom of Information Act office. The agency also has yet to release full copies of the advisory council’s reports from 2017 through 2020. In copies provided to USA TODAY, the agency redacted every recommendation the council made. The Peace Corps contended the agency can withhold the information under the Freedom of Information Act because they are part of a “deliberative process.” “It would only serve to mislead the public if an agency provides detailed information that is still under development and subject to change,” the agency said. USA TODAY is continuing to push for access to the information. Glenn Blumhorst, president and CEO of the National Peace Corps Association, which represents up to 250,000 returned volunteers, said the organization has “encouraged Peace Corps leadership to be more forthcoming” about what it’s doing to better protect volunteers. “I think one of our roles is to do our best to try to hold Peace Corps accountable,” he said in an interview. ""It is sometimes challenging given the lack of transparency and the kind of cyclical nature of Peace Corps leadership and this council itself even.” Emma Tremblay, a former volunteer who reported being sexually assaulted by a doctor whom a previous volunteer had reported for inappropriate behavior, said it’s long past time to hold the agency accountable. Before ending her service in Ecuador in 2019, Tremblay started an Instagram account where she shares stories of volunteers disillusioned with the agency. In recent months, she and others have organized town halls for former volunteers and others concerned by the agency’s shortfalls. “What remains to be seen,” Tremblay said, “is whether the Peace Corps holds itself accountable to volunteers this time.” This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Sexual assault in Peace Corps: Review identifies agency failures",U.S./USA TODAY,Peace Corps volunteers were raped and assaulted.

12/13/2021,"Mark Meadows said it was ""infuriating"" when Fox News called Arizona for Biden on election night. Meadows quickly called Fox News editor Bill Sammon, forcefully tapping the numbers on his phone. ""I'm surprised I didn't crack the screen of my iPhone,"" the former Trump aide wrote in his new book. On November 3, 2020, then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows was eagerly awaiting the results of the presidential election alongside then-President Donald Trump and the multitude of Republican loyalists who were on hand at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. As Meadows relished in Trump's vote advantage over then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in Florida — an electoral behemoth prized by both major political parties — he also remarked on the then-president's leads in additional swing states. To the Republicans present at the White House, Trump's reelection to a second term seemed nearly assured, according to the former presidential aide's new book. When a phone call came through for Trump from veteran Republican political consultant Karl Rove to congratulate him for his success that night, Meadows said that the then-president was waiting for official network calls to declare victory. However, when Fox News called the state of Arizona for Biden — projecting a win for the former vice president in a state that had not supported a Democratic presidential nominee since Bill Clinton in 1996 — the mood in the White House turned sour, Meadows wrote in ""The Chief's Chief."" ""I walked back down to the Map Room, where our analysts were reporting good news from social media. The Twitter traffic was all trending in the right direction,"" Meadows described the scene at around 10:30 p.m. that night. He continued: ""Then, out of nowhere, I heard a loud series of screams and expletives from the next room. Fox News had called Arizona for Joe Biden."" Meadows, a former congressman from North Carolina who served in office from 2013 to 2020, is no stranger to political campaigns and said that the decision to call Arizona for Biden at that stage was premature. ""Not only was this infuriating, but it was also mathematically impossible to determine at this early hour. With the information that Fox News had at the time, they could not possibly have been able to legitimately make the call that they did,"" he wrote. The presidential aide had previously initiated a testy phone call with Bill Sammon — who at the time was the managing editor of Fox News Washington — over what he felt was uneven election coverage by the network. On election night, Meadows felt that his growing suspicions about Fox News had been validated. ""My worst fears — that there was a liberal contingent within the network trying to sabotage President Trump in the name of objectivity — had been realized. I dialed Bill Sammon once again, tapping the numbers with such force that I'm surprised I didn't crack the screen of my iPhone,"" he wrote. He told Sammon: ""There is no information that you could have at this time that would make this call possible."" Sammon informed Meadows that the network's election modeling projected a Trump loss in Arizona, but the top presidential aide pushed back on the call. ""It may well be that President Trump loses Arizona,"" Meadows replied. ""But if he does, it's going to be by fewer than ten thousand votes, and there is no way you could know that right now."" In the final tally, Biden edged out Trump in Arizona by 10,457 votes out of nearly 3.4 million ballots cast. Meadows said that he received a dismissive response from Sammon, who reportedly expressed to him that it wasn't the network's job to placate political figures in the White House. According to three individuals who spoke with The New York Times, Sammon received criticism from Fox News executives for his oversight of the network's election coverage, despite the accuracy of the Arizona projection. Sammon retired from the network in January. The presidential aide later complained in the book that in the early morning hours of November 4, Democratic-leaning votes were being added to tallies across the country, without mentioning that states including Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were restricted from counting Biden-skewing mail-in ballots until Election Day.
