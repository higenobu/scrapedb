3/18/2022,"The UK should be helping Caribbean nations sever ties with the monarchy rather than sending the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on a charm offensive, Caribbean experts and Windrush campaigners say, predicting that Barbados’s decision to remove the Queen as head of state may have a domino effect across the region. The royals will embark on a tour of Jamaica, Belize and the Bahamas on Saturday that is widely viewed as an attempt to persuade other Caribbean nations not to follow Barbados’s example, after the Queen was said to have been dismayed by the island’s move. But although many hold warm feelings towards the royals across the Caribbean, calls for true independence are growing louder, especially among the younger generation, and in Jamaica, which celebrates 60 years of independence in 2022. Patrick Vernon, a Windrush campaigner, cultural historian and the author of 100 Great Black Britons, said: “Britain still has key legal and economic ties, which makes it difficult for a country like Jamaica to be truly independent. This year is an opportunity for people to reflect: do we want to be a republic, and what does that mean? If Jamaica decided it did, there would be a domino effect on the rest of the English-speaking Caribbean.” Jamaica’s opposition leader, Mark Golding, has called for the Queen to be removed as head of state. A lawyer, Hugh Small QC, recently burned three judicial wigs as part of a call to move away from the UK-based privy council as the country’s highest court, and cultural figures such as the dancehall artist Sizzla have voiced their support. Jamaica is thought to be split over the question of removing the Queen as head of state, which Vernon said was a complex one since although there was an awareness of the negative impact of the colonial legacy, a sense of “Britain as the mother country” persisted. He said many Jamaicans did not fully understand the Windrush scandal and what it says about the UK’s attitude towards them, as it had been under-reported in the country. However, he argued that it was time for the country to hold a referendum – a required first step towards removing the Queen as head of state – to gauge the mood of the public. Emily Zobel Marshall, an academic whose research focuses on Caribbean culture, said it had come as a surprise in the Caribbean that Barbados was the first country to remove the Queen as head of state, given its close links and “Little England” moniker. She suggested that the prime minister Mia Mottley’s success was down to perceptions of her as “a very strong woman” who had “impressed the world”, whereas other Caribbean leaders feared that a referendum on the Queen would be misconstrued as a popularity contest. Zobel Marshall said that rather than engaging in a charm offensive, the royals should be working with the UK government to facilitate the conversation in the Caribbean around full independence and meaningful reparations led by local needs. “We’ve had centuries of enslavement, followed by colonialism in the Caribbean. The damage that has been done economically and historically by Britain is vast, and the legacies of that are ongoing. To still have the Queen as the head of state, in this day and age, is baffling to me,” she said. “I think it’s important symbolically not to be a part of that hierarchy. It’s important for Caribbean countries to be proud of themselves in their own right and to be untethered from Britain.” William and Kate’s trip suggested “there’s clearly an anxiety in the royal family about other English-speaking countries pulling out of the Commonwealth”, she said. Zobel Marshall added: “I think that having the Queen as head of state in the Caribbean is locked into that way of thinking, that sense of superiority, that nostalgia for the past when Britain ruled the waves. Instead of sending the beautiful couple out there to woo the royal family back into favour, they should be talking about what’s best for the Caribbean nations.”",News/World news,Windrush campaigner criticises royal charm offensive in Caribbean,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/windrush-campaigner-criticises-royal-charm-offensive-in-caribbean
3/18/2022,"As Voltaire put it: “Life is a shipwreck but we must not forget to sing in the lifeboats”. The great French philosopher might just as well have been referencing Eddie Jones’s England before their final leg of a hitherto unrewarding 2022 Six Nations voyage. Paris is never an easy place to go, let alone for sides whose title hopes have, in effect, already left the harbour on a P&O ferry. Compared with France, seeking to seal their first grand slam since 2010, England have had a consistently turbulent passage since they initially embarked for a storm-lashed Scotland last month. Murrayfield misery has been followed by last week’s Twickenham tribulations and now here they are needing to beat Europe’s best side, in Paris, to avoid finishing in the bottom half of the championship for the second year in a row. Keep singing, indeed. Lose by the length of the Champs-Élysées under the Stade de France floodlights and, Italy aside, the 2019 World Cup finalists will have managed just two wins (both at home) in eight Six Nations fixtures over the past two seasons. Against Scotland, Wales and Ireland this year they have scored a total of two tries. No wonder there is a sink or swim feel to their final fixture. Either way, those who reappointed Jones for a second term as England’s head coach will be feeling twitchy. If France do win a slam, no England coach will have flown back with a more pot-holed championship record for 15 years. Admittedly England did win the 2020 title on the rebound from the World Cup but, with Jones’s squad having also finished fifth in 2018, the sense of underachievement relative to their resources is growing. For every forward step England take under Jones, they seem prone to taking two backwards. Overly harsh? Not if you judge England as rigorously as they should be judging themselves. Yes, they were gallant with only 14 men in unenviable circumstances against Ireland but the 4-0 try count in the visitors’ favour cannot simply be dismissed as one of those things. For all the talk of a brave new England, the same maddening structural and selectorial flaws continue to resurface. The team picked for this game is a classic example. Is George Furbank really the best full-back in the land? Where is the specialist blinding pace out wide? Or a complementary midfield? Or someone whom poor Marcus Smith or Henry Slade can potentially use as a line-breaking foil? Lately England have basically been hiring a jazz quartet to go on tour with The Stranglers. Of course England continue to be beset by injuries. A British & Irish Lions tour which stretched deep into August has clearly taken a significant toll. But it is the same for all the other home nations who have mostly managed to make the best of it. For Jones to say, as he did this week, that he might be unable to field his best XV until next year’s World Cup will not greatly thrill the willing and available squad members over whom he presides. Equally disingenuous was his claim last Monday that being Australian was somehow counting against him in England. “I don’t think it helps being an Australian but that’s part of the deal.” Really? He never complained about the old ‘Wizard of Oz’ headlines in happier days and there remain some decent cattle at his disposal. Smith, Slade, Maro Itoje, Ellis Genge, Sam Simmonds, Sam Underhill…used properly all are top-notch operators who deserve much, much better. Too many others, though, have been either summarily discarded in the endless pursuit of something shinier or, usually, bigger. The guillotine treatment dished out to the highly talented Max Malins this week is the latest dispiriting case study. Even if England were somehow to win in Paris it will simply paper over the widening cracks. But where is the rugby nous at the top of the Rugby Football Union to rectify the situation? How many companies in any industry would not even reprimand an employee who has written a book for personal gain in which he slags off certain members of his team for their lack of leadership aptitude? Listening to Jones publicly ducking responsibility the other day for what appeared under his name, choosing instead to try to throw his excellent ghostwriter under the bus, was the final straw. It is all such a striking contrast to what is steadily building in France. England have sneaked to victory in the last two games between the sides, both of them decided by a close-range try in the closing moments, but Les Bleus are maturing fast. Fourteen of their XV also started the 40-25 win over New Zealand in Paris in November; it would have been 15 had the hooker Julien Marchand not been injured. In addition they have the best kicker in the tournament in Melvyn Jaminet, the best scrum-half, the most unyielding midfield and, collectively, a they-shall-not-pass mindset courtesy of their persuasive and relentlessly successful defence coach, Shaun Edwards. “He’s transformed them, hasn’t he?” acknowledged England’s attack coach Martin Gleeson, who know Edwards well. “They respect him 100 per cent and they’ll go the trenches for him. No matter where he goes he seems to have success.” Maybe England will find some joy elsewhere. They will hope to unsettle the French line-out, as Wales did, and cause problems aerially but they will also have to subdue the most dynamic attacking threat they have yet confronted. France also have a tendency to score early and the home crowd will revel in every visiting error. With Jaminet around to punish any ill-discipline at the breakdown and the 8-9-10 combo of Grégory Alldritt, Antoine Dupont and Romain Ntamack growing in stature, England will have to take every half-chance they are given. The South African referee Jaco Peyper will be another crucial figure but, assuming a red card is not shown to a French forward inside the first two minutes, something special will be required to ruin the grandest of French finales. Much water has flowed beneath the Pont des Arts since Les Bleus last won a slam in 2010 but these days the French rugby public are falling back in love with their blossoming team. And England? As Voltaire perceptively put it: “The only way to truly see yourself is in the reflection of someone else’s eyes.”",Sport/Sport,Eddie Jones’s inconsistent England stand in way of French grand slam,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/18/eddie-joness-inconsistent-england-stand-in-way-of-french-grand-slam
3/18/2022,"Driving more slowly, turning down the air-conditioning, car free Sundays and working from home should be adopted as emergency measures to reduce the global demand for oil, according to a 10-point plan from the International Energy Agency (IEA). Such measures and changes to consumer behaviour would allow the world to cut its oil usage by 2.7m barrels per day (bpd) within four months – equivalent to more than half of Russia’s exports – the global energy watchdog said. The IEA laid out a series of measures it said would help reduce global demand, currently close to 100m bpd, helping to ease sky-high oil prices hurting consumers and reduce reliance on Kremlin-controlled resources. Immediate steps it recommended including reduced speed limits, car-free Sundays and cheaper public transport. “These efforts would reduce the price pain being felt by consumers around the world, lessen the economic damage, shrink Russia’s hydrocarbon revenues, and help move oil demand towards a more sustainable pathway,” it said. The IEA said that many of its proposals could be implemented by governments of advanced economies immediately, and estimated how much oil they would save by doing so. Reduce speed limits on highways by at least 10 km/hSaves around 290,000 bpd of oil use from cars, and an additional 140,000 bpd if trucks also reduced their speed. “A reduction in speed limits can be implemented by national governments; many countries did so during the 1973 oil crisis, including the United States and several European countries,” the IEA said. Work from home up to three days a week where possibleOne day a week saves around 170,000 bpd; three days saves around 500,000. Pre-pandemic, the use of private vehicles to commute was responsible for around 2.7m barrels of oil use a day, the IEA said, yet about one-third of those jobs could be done from home. Car-free Sundays in citiesEvery Sunday saves around 380,000 bpd; one Sunday a month saves 95,000. Switzerland, the Netherlands and West Germany all did this during the 1973 oil crisis and some cities have used the measure to promote public health more recently. Benefits include cleaner air, reduced noise pollution and improved road safety, the IEA report said. Make public transport cheaper and incentivise walking and cyclingSaves around 330,000 bpd. New Zealand is halving public transport fares for the next three months in response to high fuel prices, while studies in the US have shown cheaper fares lead to greater use. Some governments have incentivised people to walk or subsidised bike purchases. All of this would require government subsidy. Alternate private car access to roads in large cities (eg every other day)Saves around 210,000 bpd. For example, cars whose number plate ends with an odd number can drive on Monday and those with an even number can drive on Tuesdays. Such schemes have been deployed to tackle congestion and air pollution peaks in Athens, Madrid, Paris, Milan and Mexico City. Exceptions could be made for electric vehicles. One downside is that households with multiple cars could game the rules. Increase car sharing and adopt practices to reduce fuel useSaves around 470,000 bpd. Carpooling has long been used as a way to save money and reduce emissions. Governments can incentivise this with dedicated traffic lanes and parking spaces, or by reducing road tolls on higher occupancy vehicles. Many smartphone apps exist to arrange ride-shares. Cars are more inefficient if poorly maintained or driven at an incorrect tyre pressure. The IEA also found that air conditioning can account for 4% to 10% of fuel use, so recommends setting the thermostat three degrees higher on hot days. Promote efficient driving for freight trucks and delivery of goodsSaves around 320,000 bpd. As with private cars, freight trucks can be driven more efficiently, including the use of so-called “eco-driving” techniques such as reducing excess weight and not slowing down or speeding up abruptly. Loads should also be optimised to avoid journeys with empty vehicles. Using high-speed and night trains instead of planesSaves around 40,000 bpd. Based on existing high-speed rail infrastructure, around 2% of flights in advanced economies could be shifted to trains, according to the IEA. Almost all of this involves flights of less than 800km. Avoid business air travel where alternative options existSaves around 260,000 bpd. The IEA recommends virtual meetings where possible and points out that firms such as HSBC, Zurich Insurance, and S&P Global plan to cut their business travel emissions by as much as 70%. Reinforce the adoption of electric and more efficient vehiclesSaves around 100,000 bpd. By the end of last year, 8.4m electrical vehicles (EVs) were on the road in advanced economies but the IEA urged faster adoption. “Actions taken now to hasten the adoption of electric vehicles will have a sustained effect in the future,” it said. The IEA called for governments to pursue such measures to counter massive global disruption. “As a result of Russia’s appalling aggression against Ukraine, the world may well be facing its biggest oil supply shock in decades, with huge implications for our economies and societies,” said the IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol. Reducing oil use must not remain a temporary measure, the report noted. “Sustained reductions are important not only to improve countries’ energy security but also to tackle climate change and reduce air pollution,” it said.",News/Business,Car free Sundays? IEA sets out 10-point plan to reduce global oil demand,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/18/car-free-sundays-iea-sets-out-10-point-plan-to-reduce-global-oil-demand
3/18/2022,"A group of prominent Black men and women have said they long “for a day when Black people do not feel unsafe” in the presence of police, as plans for protests gather pace in the wake of the Child Q scandal, in which a Black child was subjected to a strip-search at school that involved exposure of intimate body parts. A letter signed by more than a dozen public figures, including football pundit Ian Wright and the chief business officer of Condé Nast, Vanessa Kingori, accuses the Metropolitan police of endemic racism and calls for “immediate and decisive action” to right the wrong, including holding to account the officers who were involved. Pressure is growing on the Met to acknowledge and address fury and dismay within Black communities after an official investigation found racism was likely to have been an “influencing factor” in the officers’ actions. No appropriate adult was present during the 15-year-old girl’s ordeal, described by a senior local authority figure as “humiliating, traumatising and utterly shocking” and which took place without parental consent and in the knowledge that she was menstruating. A demonstration is planned on Friday afternoon in Stoke Newington, north-east London, with a further solidarity march planned on Sunday. Tweeting details of the event, Windrush campaigner Patrick Vernon called for “full accountability and criminal prosecutions”, adding that “warm apologies” were now outdated. On Thursday the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, condemned the strip-search as she presented the government’s strategy for tackling racial disparities in the UK. She called it an “appalling incident”, but said the public backlash against the incident shows the UK is “a country that cares about ethnic minorities”. The Metropolitan police have apologised for what a senior officer described as the child’s “truly regrettable” treatment, which is the subject of a separate Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation. The letter to the Met’s deputy commissioner, Sir Stephen House, organised by Black maternal health campaigner Five X More’s Atinuke Awe, expresses a “collective devastation” for Child Q, adding: “We feel her pain and trauma throughout our community and we long for a day when Black people do not feel unsafe in your presence.” Awe said she had organised the letter as a mother and champion of Black mothers. “The injustice we face as Black people every day is exhausting,” she said. “Our children should be kept safe from harm, especially in the places that are supported to protect them. As parents we all feel deeply connected to Child Q and we need there to be more accountability for the perpetrators. More needs to be done to ensure this doesn’t happen again.” The letter continues: “People from Black communities do not […] have trust or faith that the police will treat people from these communities fairly and without bias.” The letter is signed by entertainment stars including singer-songwriter Jamelia, Little Mix’s Leigh-Anne Pinnock, singer and television presenter Rochelle Humes and actor and model Jodie Turner-Smith, as well as MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy, leader of the Women’s Equality party, Mandu Reid, writer Candice Carty-Williams and academic Kehinde Andrews. Campaigners Shola Mos-Shogbamimu, Clotilde Abe from Five X More, Carina White of Black Mums Upfront, Osha Daley of Pregnant then Screwed, Elliott Rae of Music, Fatherhood and Football and Ben Anderson of Diary of a Dad also added their support. The letter concludes: “We are calling on you to take immediate and decisive action on this issue, to demonstrate and acknowledge that this behaviour is and was wholly unacceptable.” ",News/UK news,Child Q scandal: prominent Black Britons call on Met to right wrong,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/18/child-q-scandal-black-britons-letter-to-met-police
3/18/2022,"I’m 43 and father to a wonderful daughter, whom I co-parent. I live abroad now but am British-born. My parents were abusive, and this left me with PTSD; I no longer have contact and am happy not to be part of that toxic dynamic. I’ve done the work, given myself a shot at my life, and am a pretty good parent. My ebullient nature was squashed by the dysfunction and violence I experienced when young. Substance misuse and suicide attempts followed and, while I was quite bright and talented, I would create opportunities then sabotage them. It wasn’t until I was 32 that I found a therapist who was able to help. My parents will never own the damage they caused, and come from horrible backgrounds themselves. Any contact saw them continuing to create a dependent, dysfunctional and toxic relationship, with me as the listener and care giver, and when I refused, my name was mud. I wish to forgive my parents, but what they did was child abuse. I do not like them as people, and have precious little in common with them. When they become frail and need care, I will be involved, my choice – but how do I let go of my resentment? I’m very sorry for the abuse you suffered but confess to being confused by why, after everything, you’d want to be involved in their care. I realise children – even adult children – are endlessly forgiving of their parents. But you seem very strong in your resolve to avoid your parents. What do you think will change when they get older? Is it that they will be vulnerable and you will have power over them? Abusive parents don’t tend to change; they just get older and the risk of psychological, if not physical, abuse remains. I would tread very carefully. I consulted family psychotherapist Lorraine Davies-Smith (aft.org.uk) who noted that it sounded as if you’d had a year of therapy a decade ago and wondered if this was something you might consider revisiting? She said: “You say you wish to forgive your parents, but to forgive, we need an understanding of how and why someone was able to do what they did. That may bring understanding, which can lead to forgiveness, but you don’t seem anywhere near that.” The other thing to remember is that you don’t have to forgive – I personally think forgiveness is overrated. And you can’t let go of resentment as if it were a balloon; it takes a lot of work. But I think Davies-Smith is right that trying to understand why your parents did what they did may lead to a resolution for you. “And are you really talking about forgiving your parents or do you want to separate from them without guilt or self-criticism?” asked Davies-Smith. “Consider why you want to forgive and if the process needs to wait until they’re about to die? Isn’t it better to work on it now? You’ve also got this idea that they’re going to need care; what if they don’t? Suppose there isn’t the period of caring?” Also, it will be up to them if they get care and who looks after them. They may want professional carers; they may go into a home. And would you be prepared to leave the life you’ve made abroad, and your daughter, to come and look after them in the UK? Because it may not be in “20 years”, it could be in a couple of years that they need you. Think carefully and honestly, perhaps with the help of a therapist, about what you want and how, practically, to achieve that, in the near future.

3/18/2022,"As we move into the late stages of the pandemic, it is important to reflect on the scientific discoveries of the past two years, so that we are better prepared for future virus outbreaks. I believe there are two areas in particular where we can learn from the experience. The first is understanding that outbreaks are not always easy to identify quickly. Viruses such as Nipah and Ebola cause severe, and therefore obvious, illness in everyone who is infected. The fatality rate is high but transmissibility is low, with an R number – the rate used in epidemiology to measure the reproduction of a virus – of about 2 for Ebola and less than 1 for Nipah. This means that outbreaks can be rapidly identified and contained. In contrast, coronaviruses cause mild, sometimes asymptomatic, infection in the majority of people, but transmissibility is higher. The R number in early 2020 was about 5 – meaning that, on average, each infected person infected five others. Transmission can also occur before symptom onset. The first reports of “pneumonia of unknown cause” in four people that heralded the start of the Sars-CoV-2 outbreak didn’t appear to provide much cause for concern – but those cases were investigated because the 2002 Sars outbreak in the same part of the world had not been forgotten. Rapid and strict local lockdowns prevented virus transmission in China but, at the time, no one was aware of how much the virus was spreading, undetected, in Europe. That was because of something I hadn’t paid much attention to previously: a lack of diagnostic capabilities. Border closures shut the stable door after the horse had bolted and, in the spring of 2020, the lack of ability to conduct widespread testing meant decisions were made in the absence of clear information about who was infected. The 2015 Mers outbreak in South Korea was caused by one person who became infected while travelling and then visited several hospitals in Seoul, resulting in 186 cases, 38 deaths and a multibillion dollar cost. The Mers fatality rate is usually stated as 34%, but that is only among those who are ill enough to seek treatment – we know asymptomatic and mild infections also occur without being detected. In comparison, the fatality rate was not very different among those hospitalised with Covid-19 in early 2020, at about 26%. If the Korean traveller had been less seriously ill, the Mers virus could have spread undetected for far longer, as Covid did, and to countries less able to suppress transmission. In 2020, the sudden need for large-scale testing resulted in a large number of manufacturers producing test kits, some much more accurate than others. If we are to be prepared for future outbreaks, more needs to be done to develop testing strategies where production can be scaled up rapidly and accurately if required. If the next outbreak is caused by another novel virus, it will probably be related to a known pathogen – just as Sars-CoV-2 is related to the original Sars virus. With a testing strategy in place, existing test kits could provide a stopgap at the beginning of a new outbreak until a more specific test is developed. This would allow for a targeted quarantine of a small number of people at an early stage, and could prevent the new virus from spreading further. The second thing we should learn from the past two years is the importance of vaccine-manufacturing facilities. Oxford University has its own small-scale Clinical Biomanufacturing Facility, which worked heroically quickly to produce the first batch of our ChAdOx1 Covid vaccine. Clinical trials began in April 2020 and, from there, we should have been able to scale up production via the Vaccine Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (VMIC), established in 2018 with support from academic institutions including Oxford, as well as vaccine companies and UK government funding. But the manufacturing plant had not been built. The VMIC construction programme was accelerated with further funding, but we had to move from one manufacturer to another to provide vaccines for rapidly expanding clinical trials. Our partner, AstraZeneca, set up a worldwide network of manufacturers, but transferring technology to each new facility took many months of hard work and, once the vaccine had been licensed for emergency use, supply lagged behind demand. There is much more to do in developing vaccines against diseases such as Lassa fever, Nipah and others, but VMIC is now up for sale, as “the need for surge capacity has passed”. This leaves us in the same situation as before, when it should be obvious that we will need the VMIC again. To help tackle this challenge and more, Oxford is setting up its own Pandemic Sciences Institute to ensure that the world is better equipped to create global, science-driven solutions that allow us to prepare for, identify and counter pandemic threats. We should never again have to experience the same failure for vaccines with proven efficacy to be made available equitably around the world.

3/18/2022,"If you notice that a wine you bought a couple of weeks ago is suddenly 50p more expensive, you no doubt assume that all the other bottles have gone up, too. The real surprise, however, is that there is still a fair amount of value around, with prices not much higher than they were 12 months ago. One reason for this is that the supermarkets are getting progressively more ingenious about their marketing. Tesco, for example, now seems to have near-permanent discounts for its Clubcard members, even in smaller stores; Co-op members also benefit from discounts. And the more affordable 20% off three bottles seems to have become more popular than 25% off six. But how do they manage these lower prices, especially after Brexit? The supermarkets themselves are reluctant to talk about promotions, waffling on about being committed to offering value to their customers, but my suspicion that they treat wine as a loss-leader is borne out by wine consultant Angela Mount, former head buyer for Somerfield. “A wine promotion will often be funded from a central marketing pot for several departments,” she says, “but it’s a key footfall driver and pays for itself in sheer volume.” So what do you have to spend nowadays to get a decent bottle? Although many supermarket wines have now hit the £9.99 mark, I can guarantee that, if you’re prepared to spend between £7 and £8 a bottle, you’ll still drink pretty well. I’d say the three most important things you can do to keep your wine bill down are not to be sniffy about own-label, particularly the premium ranges such as Tesco’s Finest, Morrisons The Best and Asda’s Extra Special; buy brands only when they’re on offer; and stick to inexpensive sources such as South Africa, which is currently giving New Zealand a run for its money on sauvignon blanc – Chile and Portugal, especially for reds, Languedoc (cheaper for rosé than Provence), and cava, which offers the best value for sparkling wine; Italian wines, especially whites, are also almost invariably good value, too. According to Mount, some of us are willing to pay more, even at discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. “They’ve been really successful in building credibility in the quality of their wines,” she says. “So if people see a barolo at £13.99, they assume it’s going to be good and are inclined to spoil themselves, especially at weekends. When restaurants reopened, there was a rush to eat out, but people forgot how expensive it is to go out, say, twice a week – and £13.99 a bottle in a restaurant would be cheap.” Tesco Finest Soave Classico Superiore £7.50, 13%. You have to thank soave for being such an unfashionable wine for this brilliant price. A really elegant, Italian white that would be great with risotto, or chicken or pasta in a creamy sauce. Villiera Sauvignon Blanc 2021 £8 (by the case) Marks & Spencer, 13%. New Zealand had a poor sauvignon harvest in 2021, so look to South Africa for savvy b bargains such as this deliciously crisp, citrussy example. Morrisons The Best Barbera d’Asti 2018 £7.50, 14.5%. Warm, hearty barbera is a bit of a bargain, and great with robust pasta dishes or pulses. Aldi Specially Selected Ribera del Duero 2019 £7.99, 13.5%. If you like rioja, you’ll love ribera del duero, a similarly mellow, oak-aged red from the north of Spain that cries out for a Sunday roast. Asda Extra Special Fiano Terre Siciliane 2020 £6, 12.5%. Smooth, ripe, peachy, chardonnay-like white with a fresh, citrussy aftertaste. Ideal with a chicken caesar salad.

3/18/2022," Children in New York have been back at school for a single week without masks and already the old favourites are back. On Saturday, it’s a sore throat and a sniffle (two at-home tests, not Covid). On Sunday, the phlegmy cough sets in (another test, not Covid). On Monday, the vomiting starts, something we haven’t seen since 2019. Hello, old friend. It’s been so long, I’ve forgotten the drill. At 3am, stumbling into the kitchen and throwing open the cupboards, I wonder which one is the vomit bowl and whether in the last two years I’ve used it for pasta. (I have.) The next morning, my children are white as ghosts on the sofa, shivering under a blanket. I’ve forgotten the day-after-a-night-of-vomiting drill, too. Everyone looks so sad and lethargic, I order Slurpees for delivery from the 7-Eleven. Life is short; let these people have their red and blue frozen drinks – a course of action to which, with a fraction more forethought, I might have predicted the outcome. On the other hand, purple vomit does, briefly, lift everyone’s spirits. After a day of rest and some dry toast per the rules, I send one back into school, while the other remains home. Post-Covid, coughing in public is a nerve-wracking business, and 90 minutes after drop-off, the nurse rings for me to come fetch my child. Red-faced and exhausted, she has spent the morning trying to conceal her cough like Typhoid Mary and is in a dismal state. We do a fourth and final Covid test. It’s not Covid. Guiltily, I think this would be less hassle if it was. The clocks went forward in New York on Sunday, ushering in that odd three-week stretch during which there is only a four-hour time difference with London. On Tuesday, the US Senate approved legislation to make daylight saving time permanent, starting in 2023, which would extend this period of time difference to half the year. This, it seems to me, is an instinctively good thing, although I confess I have only the sketchiest familiarity with the arguments: “more cheerful” versus “farmers”, right? As with every seemingly marginal call, it turns out it’s more complicated than that, with heated interests on both sides. The only times that daylight saving was maintained year-round in the US were during the second world war and in 1973, during the oil crisis, as a measure to reduce energy consumption by keeping the lights off for longer. Over the last seven years, around 30 states have proposed ending the changing of the clocks. Proponents of the shift named the legislation the Sunshine Protection Act, which is one stop shy of calling it the Anyone Who Disagrees With Us Is a Bat In a Cave Act. There is another side to the argument. Some Americans, including experts called to the House energy and commerce committee this week, argue we should preserve the clock change, or live permanently on standard time, including several sleep experts who voiced concern that for eight months of the year, long dark mornings interfere with sleep patterns. After reading accounts of the hearing, I discover the real reason for the proposed change, which is, of course, neither about good cheer nor better wellbeing but concerns longer days enabling “more economic activity”. (The Biden administration, busy with more pressing matters, declined to take a position on any of it.) US stockbroker Peter Schiff, known only to the tax authorities and a few investigative journalists until recently, won worst take on Twitter this week with his observation “Doesn’t the president of Ukraine own a suit?” President Zelenskiy appeared by video link before the US Congress on Wednesday, dressed in his customary army green T-shirt and looking much better than a man fighting for his country while dodging Russian death squads should look. Zelenskiy’s wardrobe and demeanour have already destabilised President Macron, who appeared at the weekend sporting, as the Wall Street Journal put it, “a conspicuous strip of stubble, beefy mutton-chop sideburns, jeans and a hoodie bearing the logo of CPA 10, a special forces unit of the French air force”. The paper and others surmised he was trying to look like Zelenskiy (either that or “a tech bro”), the general conclusion being: who can blame him? Peter Schiff, is the answer to that. In 2010, Schiff ran for the Senate in his home state of Connecticut but didn’t make it past the primaries. He is an investor, primarily, whose company, Euro Pacific Bank, was the subject of a 2020 joint investigation by the New York Times and the Australian newspaper the Age, which alleged that the bank had been targeted by Operation Atlantis, a huge investigation by the tax authorities of the US, UK, Netherlands, Canada and Australia into tax evasion and organised crime. During a Zoom interview with an Australian journalist, Schiff (who denied any wrongdoing personally or by the bank) ripped off his mike, threatened to sue the Age and stormed out of his own living room. He was in a suit, but it was still not a good look. Anna Sorokin, aka Anna Delvey, aka the Fake Heiress, is due to be deported from the US to Germany this week, possibly even today, after a year in ICE custody and four years in prison for grand larceny. Sorokin, who was born in Russia and grew up partly in Germany, passed herself off as a German heiress for years in New York, during which time she conned hundreds of thousands of dollars out of her marks. It’s hard to argue that Sorokin’s crime hasn’t paid, however: she sold her life rights to Netflix for $320,000 – even if most of it did go towards paying restitution and legal bills – and is back in business on social media. I’d no desire to watch Inventing Anna, written by Shonda Rhimes and starring Julia Garner, but with a limp child on the sofa and Sorokin back in the news, decided to give it a go. I don’t know if was the plodding writing, or Anna Chlumsky’s gurning journalist, or Garner turning in an accent that sounds Austrian by way of Texas; or maybe it’s just a post-Trump thing. But half an episode in, the invitation to spend another 10 hours with this hollow grifter seemed less appealing than knuckling down to deal with the faint purple stains in the bathroom. On the phone to a kitchen appliance store, the automated message announces a 30-minute wait time for customer help with the line “During these extraordinary times, we are working to bring you the best service, but owing to safety considerations around Covid-19, we ask for your patience.” As the rules relax, these guys – and the hotels, and airlines, and contractors, and big box stores – are on extremely borrowed time with their bogus pretext for terrible service.

3/18/2022,"Amateur hackers are being warned off joining Ukraine’s “IT army” by western officials, amid fears that activists could be breaking the law or launch attacks that spiral out control. Ukraine’s cyber-response to the Russian invasion has been bolstered by hackers organising on the Telegram messaging app under the IT Army of Ukraine banner. More than 300,000 people have signed up to the group, including members from outside Ukraine. Western officials said they would “strongly discourage” joining the group and taking part in hacking activity against Russia.” “We wouldn’t encourage criminality in any way, shape or form,” said one official on Thursday. “We would strongly discourage people from looking to get involved in those kinds of activities.” Ukraine’s cyber-offensive has had particular success with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, in which websites are rendered unreachable by being bombarded with traffic. Russian government websites including the Kremlin and the Duma have been targeted in this way as well as Russia Today, the state-media owned news service. Anonymous, a hacking collective, has also claimed credit for DDoS attacks. Joining Ukrainian cyber-attacks from the US or the UK could break the law in those countries, according to experts, such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in the US and the computer misuse act in the UK. “Whilst I totally understand the sentiment behind the actions of many in this IT army, two wrongs do not make a right. Not only might it be illegal but it runs the risk of playing into Putin’s hands by enabling him to talk about ‘attacks from the west’,” said Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University. He added that hacks could have unintended consequences and “it’s very easy for cyber-attacks is to spill over into unintended areas”.” Western officials said the Ukrainian government has so far performed well against cyber-attacks during the war. So far Ukraine has been targeted by DDoS attacks and several “wiper” attacks, which destroy computers but have had limited impact in this instance. Officials said a “successful” Ukrainian cyber-defence had been assisted by western governments. “Behind the scenes [there has been] … a massive international government effort to support our Ukrainian allies in this space,” said one official. They added that the UK and other western allies of Ukraine had not seen an increase in hostile Russian cyber-activity since the invasion began last month. “We are not seeing a heightened threat to the UK or generally to allies. It’s fair to say that the level of cyber-activity we see is not significantly up or down,” said one official. The most significant cyber-incident involving a western target during the conflict involved the US telecoms firm Viasat. Unidentified hackers disabled tens of thousands of modems that communicate with Viasat Inc’s KA-SAT satellite, which supplies internet to some customers in Europe, including in Ukraine. “It’s certainly something we’re investigating quite actively,” said an official.",News/World news,Amateur hackers warned against joining Ukraine’s ‘IT army’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/amateur-hackers-warned-against-joining-ukraines-it-army
3/18/2022,"Mesmerising work by P&O Ferries, whose decision to sack 800 seafaring staff over a Microsoft Teams meeting makes them slightly more distasteful boat owners than several people on the international sanctions list. Indeed, for the duration of the HR chief’s message on Thursday, there may even have been people smugglers in the Channel who would have been more palatable. Certainly, they seem to operate some of the same routes more reliably. And so to how the day unfolded. On Thursday morning, P&O Ferries recalled its vessels to port with the most ominous words in the shipping forecast – “all-colleague announcement” – promising that “long-term viability” was about to be secured. Sounds good! At which point, the human resources chief, Stephen Nee, delivered a pre-recorded message from some kind of middle-management bunker, as though he were coordinating the resistance of a besieged eastern European country and not just avoiding having to look any of the staff in the eye when he tells then they’re being “restructured” with immediate effect. The former employees were informed their jobs would be promptly taken over by cheaper agency workers. Whether this is even legal is a matter of some debate; suffice to say the implications of the story continue to unfurl themselves like the petals of a stinking corpse lily. Having made their peace with losing out on Employers of the Year 2022, P&O Ferries apparently followed up the video message by sending balaclava-wearing, handcuff-trained private security guards on to the boats to clear away all remaining … colleagues, is it? Some staff refused to leave their vessels but eventually dispersed when it was suggested that they were risking their severance. Justified outrage is apparently above their paygrade. Sorry – ex-paygrade. Even the government seems appalled, while a lot of people have a lot of questions. None of which are, “Ooh, is Stephen Nee single?” For the video alone, he must be judged the worst person associated with ferries since Chris Grayling. (Although, as I know you’ll recall, Chris was more associated with firms that didn’t have any ferries. That was kind of the problem. All right, all right – one of the problems.) I can tell you that a mere four months ago, Mr Nee was on LinkedIn pushing a video celebrating P&O Ferries as an employer who wanted to “do things differently”. As this uplifting film explained of working at the company – “It’s not just a job; it’s a career. It’s not just a job; it’s the future of seafaring. It’s not just a job; it’s family.” Righto. Unfortunately, it’s the Roy family. Anyway, further down Steve’s LinkedIn page is a glowing salutation from one of his previous managing directors. “I would welcome Steve on to my team any time,” this reads, “especially when facing union challenges. He has a passion for pushing boundaries of existing practice to explore new ideas and methodologies.” I think we’re all on the point of being able to see that, mate. The boundaries of existing practice appear to have been not so much pushed as shat on. Dimly and belatedly realising that perhaps he ought to say something, P&O Ferries’ chief executive, Peter Hebblethwaite, wrote to staff on Friday morning, touching euphemistically on what he called “changes we’re making to our crewing model”. Why do people talk like this even in their employees’ hour of anguish? It’s not “changes to a crewing model” – it’s sacking them. I see he’s also claiming it is “essential” that staff “avoid posting any comments or views on social media”. So I’m happy to point out that Peter will be paid hundreds of thousands of pounds a year to be this much of a cowardly arse. Of course, it’s not just Peter and Stephen – in many ways they’re the monkeys as opposed to the organ-grinder. As you’d expect of any self-respecting island nation, Britain’s P&O Ferries is now owned by the Dubai-based DP World. Things we know about DP World? They have a £146m unpaid debt with the Merchant Navy Ratings pension fund, which is supposed to offer P&O Ferries staff security in their retirement. And they’ve also just spaffed £147m sponsoring golf’s European tour. Which seems a little on the nose, even by the debased standards of the age. As for the age, it continues to feel not-as-billed. The movies might have led you to believe that late stage capitalism would feature a charismatically monstrous overlord, shot on a multimillion-dollar lighting budget. In fact, it’s just a guy called Steve reading off his Notes app, as he explains that your immediate financial devastation is “well beyond the statutory requirements”. Hard to imagine how this could have been more excruciating, unless Steve had prefaced it with a poem by Bono, as the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, did the same day in her St Patrick’s Day remarks. Affectlessly aware that they can do whatever they want, executives like Steve talk like the hold music to the underworld. Perhaps appropriately. After all, in ancient Greek mythology, Charon the ferryman would carry the newly deceased souls across the River Styx. It was a fairly turbo-capitalist transit system itself, actually – if you didn’t have the fare you had to wander the shores for a hundred years, probably while a lot of spectral figures explained how you could easily have saved for a house deposit if you’d just had the drive to live a bit longer. Charon was described as a “sordid god” by Virgil (who was not the poet Bono is, but still quite good), though that was all thousands of years ago. These days, we should expect our passage to the other side to be helmed by someone very like Stephen Nee, probably droning “get in the hole” as he watches European tour highlights on his phone.

3/18/2022,"What is Jason Segel up to? It’s a question one is intended to pose during the opening of contained Netflix crime thriller Windfall, the actor poking his way through an extravagant Ojai house, pissing in the shower and rubbing his fingerprints off from door handles. But it’s also a question that many of us have been asking for the last almost decade of film, the actor fading from the comedy A-list and far, far into the background. It was weirdly Sex Tape – a film that also counts as Cameron Diaz’s last screen credit – that saw him pick up sticks and head to smaller fare (what on earth happened on the set of Sex Tape?) and even then, his choices have been sparse and minor (the few unlucky people who endured his teeth-achingly twee Charlie Kaufman-lite show Dispatches from Elsewhere will have also asked, with a more fatigued tenor, what is Jason Segel up to?). We at least now know what he was up to during the pandemic, briefly at least, reuniting with director Charlie McDowell (son of Malcolm and his then-wife Mary Steenburgen), who’d previously cast him in 2017’s little-loved sci-fi indie The Discovery. Segel co-crafted the story for McDowell’s latest, a frustratingly inert little trifle, bizarrely purchased by Netflix for a rumoured eight-figure total, intended audience more of a mystery than the story itself. McDowell has also cast his wife, Emily in Paris’ Lily Collins (daughter of Phil) as his co-lead, playing the unfulfilled spouse of Jesse Plemons’ obnoxious tech billionaire. The couple are the owners of the aforementioned palace, interrupting what appears to be a robbery of sorts. The Covid-conceived and shot film, which could have easily been a stage play, then cosies the three up for the duration, spatting with each other as they figure out how to survive. What’s most surprising about Windfall is how little surprise the script, written by Seven scribe Andrew Kevin Walker and McDowell collaborator Justin Lader, then has to offer. We assume there’s something greater at play, some juicy secrets waiting to be unfurled, something to elevate it past the rather rote dynamic at its centre. Because without that, we’re stuck with a character-driven drama driven by characters that have fallen asleep at the wheel, the film tanked by an alarming overestimation of how much interest we’ll have in what three mostly uninteresting people have to say and do. There’s a lackadaisical attempt to say something about wealth in America and what it represents for many – what should people with so much do with it and does having so much make one any more interesting or necessary than someone who doesn’t – but it’s more shallow, two-joints-in pondering than anything approaching genuine social commentary. Windfall is lightly positioned as some sort of contemporary, socially aware genre deconstruction but tonally, it feels more like we’re back in the late 90s, watching a talky, sub-Tarantino crime thriller. There’s a crackle missing from the dialogue, the script outdone by McDowell’s crisp, bright visuals (it’s a hell of a house) and a fun, atmospheric score from Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans. There’s never really enough for the underserved trio of actors to sink their teeth into, although they all manage to coast comfortably enough – Plemons subverting his nice and quiet shtick to become loud and odious, Collins trying to bring depth to a bored trophy wife with edge and Segel further scuzzing it up to distance himself from any studio comedy associations. Windfall is one of many, many, many Covid concoctions that feels like it was made more for those involved than for any real audience outside of Los Angeles, an acting exercise to pass time until postponed productions started up again. Taken on that level, it’s great those involved were able to remain productive. Taken on any other level, it’s not quite the reward its title would have you believe.

3/18/2022,"A resurgence of Covid cases is under way across the UK, with infections in the over-70s at a record high, official figures have shown. Based on random swab tests taken in the community, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that almost 5%, or 1,544,600 people, in England had Covid in the week ending 12 March, and 3.5% of people in the oldest age group. Infections also reached a record high in Scotland, with one in 14 testing positive. The high prevalence among older people has prompted unease, after reports this week that vaccine immunity declines steeply in care home residents. It is six months since many people in this age group had their last vaccine dose. “Older age groups, especially people who have been isolating for so long, are now quite vulnerable even if they have kept up to date with their vaccines,” said Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia. The increase in infections is being driven by the more transmissible Omicron BA.2 variant, which has become the dominant strain across the UK. It transmits more readily than the original BA.1 strain but there is good cross-immunity between the two variants. “It’s basically sweeping up everyone who didn’t get Omicron the first time around,” Hunter said. This, he added, meant the current wave was more likely to follow a short, sharp trajectory as had been seen in Denmark and the Netherlands, where there had been an Omicron BA.2 wave. “It wouldn’t surprise me if it peaks before the end of March,” he said. Prof James Naismith, a director at the Rosalind Franklin Institute at the University of Oxford, noted the higher prevalence in Scotland than England – despite its more stringent rules, including a continued mask mandate in shops and on transport. “The reality is that differences in control measures between the countries are meaningless,” he said. “Prevalence is increasing in every area and across age groups. Without vaccines, this would be bleak .… Countries with poor vaccination rates face a very challenging future. “For the UK, my main concern is for the vulnerable, for whom this disease is serious and for those whose lives will be blighted by long Covid. Every effort must be made to triple-vaccinate as many people as possible, quadruple-vaccinate the most vulnerable and make available antivirals.” Sarah Crofts, the head of analytical outputs for the ONS Infection Survey, said: “These latest figures show further increases in infections across most of the UK with high levels of infection everywhere, and in Scotland the highest our survey has seen. “These increases are largely driven by the marked rise of the Omicron BA.2 sub-variant,” she added. “It’s notable also that infections have risen in all age groups, with the over-70s reaching their highest estimate since our survey began.”",News/World news,Covid resurgence sweeping UK with infections in over-70s at record high,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/covid-resurgence-uk-infections-record-older-people-vaccinations
3/18/2022,"There’s a running theme in Phoenix Rising, the two-part documentary on Evan Rachel Wood’s story of domestic and sexual abuse by shock rocker Marilyn Manson, of evidence. Wood, a 34-year-old actor, has old photos from the early stages of her relationship with Manson, whom she met as an 18-year-old in 2006 (he was 37) – cherubic and teenage before, atrophied and vacant after. The film selects from journal entries recounting her emotions as he turned her against friends and family. There are so many press and paparazzi photos of them together, which makes public fascination with the pair – a gorgeous Hollywood Lolita with middle America’s nightmare in goth makeup – feel even more queasy now. During filming from 2019 until Wood publicly named Manson, given name Brian Warner, on Instagram in February 2021, several other women and former Manson associates come forward with details either mirroring her experience or corroborating her memories riddled by the repetitive trauma, sleep deprivation and drugs she says Manson forced on her. I can’t stop thinking about this evidence; most women don’t have near the documentation Wood does, as confirmation or support for their own memories, let alone as material for authorities. As we have seen time and again with first-person accounts stemming from the revelations of the #MeToo movement, there is power and catharsis in disclosure, in telling one’s story. But for all Wood’s personal testimony, her processing of years of memories through the language of trauma and therapy for herself and for us, the pursuit of legal action – the backbone of Phoenix Rising’s narrative – comes down to documentation, files, photos, a case. As the star of HBO’s Westworld, Wood has considerable power in her own right, and little incentive to accuse Manson for the sake of publicity, as he has claimed in a defamation lawsuit filed earlier this month (conveniently timed, as Wood told The Cut earlier this week, to the release of the documentary). So it’s disheartening to see, over the course of three hours of film covering months of working through the system, how little changes and how much comes back down to perceived trustworthiness of one’s story. To date, 16 women have accused Manson, 53, of sexual abuse – including the Game of Thrones actor Esme Bianco, whose story shares striking similarities with Wood’s – and four have sued for sexual assault. Manson has denied all allegations and has not been charged with a crime. His defamation lawsuit alleges Wood and her friend, the activist Ilma Gore, concocted a conspiracy to defame him and forged an FBI letter to shore up Wood’s allegations. (Gore, Wood told the Cut, is no longer affiliated with The Phoenix Act, Wood’s nonprofit to change the statute of limitations on abuse cases.) Phoenix Rising, directed by the Oscar-nominated Amy Berg (An Open Secret, The Case Against Adnan Syed), is the latest in a wave of documentary projects in the #MeToo era that uncovered patterns of abuse by beloved public figures, traced the long shadow of sexual trauma, and outlined the cultures that turned a blind eye. This includes Leaving Neverland, the 2019 HBO series on two thorough accounts of alleged child sexual abuse by Michael Jackson; Catch and Kill: The Podcast Tapes, on Ronan Farrow’s 2017 investigation of Harvey Weinstein, which helped ignite the outpouring of recognition that became #MeToo; On the Record, which follows former Def Jam executive Drew Dixon as she contemplates telling her story of alleged rape by music mogul Russell Simmons to the New York Times. There’s Lifetime’s Surviving R Kelly, Showtime’s We Need to Talk About Cosby, and Athlete A, on the journalists, lawyers and gymnasts who exposed the systemic of abuse of cover-up of USA gymnastics doctor Larry Nasser. HBO’s Allen v Farrow, released last year, was both an investigation into allegations that director Woody Allen molested his daughter Dylan and a personal account of Dylan’s life warped by trauma, processing, and years of public scorn and dismissal. Some of these projects strike the balance between messiness of experience, the often cyclical nature of pain and abuse, and clarity of ethics better than others. Some are justifiably postured against retaliation. All deal with the legal and emotional consequences of coming forward against a prominent person. Different alleged crimes and context, of course, but they’re all dealing, fundamentally, with intimate trauma: how it presents and morphs, how one lives with it, how long it takes to begin to understand. Wood’s allegations are, to be clear, consistently horrifying. Among them: that Manson repeatedly drugged, manipulated and coerced her on the set of his 2007 music video Heart-Shaped Glasses and “essentially raped” her on camera; that Manson controlled her eating, raped her in her sleep after he gave her a sleeping pill, tortured her with an electric shocking device, beat her with “a Nazi whip from the Holocaust” while she was tied to a kneeler and fed her meth and other drugs without her knowledge. In concert with several other women, some of whom appear in the film in a meet-up, Wood outlines a pattern of love-bombing, isolation, control and abuse. Phoenix Rising, like the others, hinges on disclosure, the catharsis that is telling one’s story, and the tricky navigation of publicity. But it also feels like the outer limit of what a #MeToo documentary can do. Five years of listening, five years of hearing the same type of patterns and recognizing how predators operate within cultures and systems, how messy one’s personal life can be and still not detract from the violation. What do we do now? As the documentary depicts, Wood was successful in getting the Phoenix Act passed in California, which raised the statute of limitations on domestic violence felonies from three to five years and required police officers to undergo more training on intimate partner violence. She cooperates with a Los Angeles police investigation into Manson and gives an interview to the FBI, shown wordlessly in the film. But still it comes down to attention. By film’s end, fearful for her safety and hiding out with her child in Tennessee, Wood decides that issuing a public statement is the best course forward. “If there’s not public outrage about this and about the crimes that he’s committed, and if there aren’t people coming forward, then there’s no real incentive for law enforcement to do something,” she says over footage of her drafting a grenade of an Instagram post. “And we could just be waiting in line at the DMV for two years waiting for something to happen.” The Phoenix Act seems eminently reasonable, an opportunity to better shape laws to the human experience and what these films, long-form investigations, podcast, testimonials hammer home again and again: trauma is messy, idiosyncratic, mutable, chameleonic. One’s ability to see clearly is a slow process even with the privilege of therapy and time. “People underestimate the power of that kind of trauma and what it does to your body and your brain,” Wood told Trevor Noah on the Daily Show this week. “This is what the laws do not reflect: the effects of trauma on the brain.” Wood was in Manson’s orbit for close to four years; when she began work on the Phoenix Act amid the #MeToo movement, the statute of limitations in California was one to three years. “One to three years is nothing to a survivor,” she told Noah. “It’s nowhere near enough.” Manson is still free (and collaborating with Kanye West), as is his right, given that he’s never been charged with or convicted of a crime. Phoenix Rising, for all its messy and compelling personal elements, ultimately jabs at that fact. When the criminal justice system doesn’t account for the long tail of trauma, what do you do? What is fair, what is right? And is it worth it? Five years and many thematically similar documentaries in, we still don’t have good answers.
