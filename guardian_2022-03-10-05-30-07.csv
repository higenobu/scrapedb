3/10/2022,"Good morning. Global outrage rises as Russian military targets civilians in Mariupol, while western officials are warning of “serious concern” that Vladimir Putin could use chemical weapons on Kyiv. In Australia, major flooding is continuing in some parts of NSW, and frustrations grow as flood victims miss out on relief payments. Russian shelling has “completely destroyed” a children’s and maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukrainian authorities have said. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called the bombing of the 600-bed complex an “atrocity”, and says countless children remain trapped under the rubble. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmitryo Kuleba, accused Russia of “holding 400,000 people hostage” in Mariupol, a city in which continuous shelling has killed more than 1,170 residents in recent days. The EU has imposed travel bans and asset freezes on another 160 Russians connected to Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile, the UN has urged Ukraine to remain “compassionate and humane” to men attempting to leave the country, despite the imposition of martial law. Britain fears Russia could be setting the stage to use a chemical weapon in Ukraine, after Kremlin officials alleged without firm evidence that the US had been supporting a bioweapons program in the country. Western officials said at a briefing on Wednesday “we’ve got good reason to be concerned about possible use of non-conventional weapons” by Russia, reflecting the experience of chemical weapon use during the Syrian civil war. The concern arose partly because Russia’s foreign ministry had been engaged in “setting the scene” by making “false flag claims” about a biological weapons program operating inside Ukraine. Residents from flood-ravaged northern NSW have criticised a federal government disaster relief package that leaves out several shires declared disaster zones. The federal MP for Richmond, Labor’s Justine Elliot, said it was “astounding” and “disgusting” that residents would be ineligible for two $1,000 payments during “a humanitarian crisis”. As Katherine Murphy writes, Scott Morrison’s tour of Lismore has once again revealed several of his “core crisis characteristics”: “passivity and blame shifting”. Meanwhile, thousands of flood victims in NSW and Queensland could also be excluded from insurance claims due to “policy fine print”, rights experts have said, with big discrepancies in coverage between major insurers. Western Australia has recorded half as many Covid-19 cases in the past week as it has during the entire pandemic. But despite the sharply rising case numbers, intensive care cases remain low so far, with epidemiologists suggesting vaccination rates have helped greatly. Australia’s $200bn Future Fund has banned investment in Israeli defence contractor Elbit Systems, which stands accused of manufacturing the type of cluster munitions reportedly used by Russian forces in the Ukraine. The company has denied producing or selling such weapons. Both Labor and the Coalition are poised to make major defence spending commitments, with national security looming as a key election issue. Scott Morrison is expected to commit $38bn for additional personnel, while Anthony Albanese will commit to spending 2% of GDP on defence. The number of non-melanoma skin cancers in Australia continues to rise steadily each year, despite successful sun-safe education campaigns, new research has found. The increase in cases of 2-6% each year for the past three decades was driven by those aged 55 and above, according to the study. Pro-gender equality rallies in Pakistan have been met with counter-protest “hijab marches” by thousands of women promoting Islamic values. International Women’s Day events have attracted significant opposition in recent years, with organisers facing death threats and abuse. Venezuela has released two American citizens held on terrorism charges. The US broke diplomatic ties with the Maduro government in 2019, but analysts suggest rapprochement amid energy insecurity concerns tied to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. South Korea’s two main presidential contenders are neck and neck, according to exit polls. Conservative Yoon Suk-yeol battles Democratic party opponent Lee Jae-myung to succeed former human rights lawyer Moon Jae-in. It’s a common prejudice that art is regarded “as heterosexual until proven otherwise”. The exhibition, Queer: Stories from the NGV Collection, is keen to dispel this, through a sensory explosion of classical paintings, video works and objects of striking juxtaposition, Giselle Au-Nhien Nguyen writes. “It’s a dazzling and sometimes overwhelming kaleidoscope of the myriad ways in which sexuality and gender can be experienced and expressed.” “If the community had not gone in there with their private boats, hundreds of people would have died.” As the extensive cleanup from flooding in northern NSW begins, so too does the debate about who is best resourced to act as “first responder” in major natural disasters, Calla Wahlquist writes. And while there are “cultural, practical and constitutional issues” surrounding the deployment of the army in instances of flooding or fires, is the Australian defence force the answer? “How can I help my child worry less about all that’s happening in the world?” It’s a common concern for many parents, amid wars, natural disasters and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. As Sarah Ayoub writes in the parenting column Sharing the Load, providing your children age-appropriate information “means carefully addressing their present and future state of mind in response to the bad news cycle.” As a self-confessed internet “laggard”, Luke Heggie is late to modern culture. But as curator of this week’s 10 funniest things on the internet, he’s unearthed everything from the Beautiful of Ridge Forrester playing frisbee, to the Bo(w)l(e)d by John Howard. Vladimir Putin has united Ukraine. After two weeks of of unimaginable horror, one stark outcome of Russia’s invasion of its neighbour is that it has galvanised and unified a once-divided land. On this episode of Full Story, eastern Europe correspondent Shaun Walker explains how the Kremlin’s war has united Ukraine.

They’re names on a whiteboard. They’re bargaining chips. They’re shopped around for chickenfeed.” A new season, a new hope. That’s one of the enduring attractions of sport. But for supporters of at least 10 NRL clubs, there’s not too much to get excited about in 2022, Nick Tedeschi writes, with Panthers, Storm and Roosters still the benchmark. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has warned of a “new economic era” in which Australians will have to accept higher costs of living due to geopolitical fallout from the Ukraine invasion, the Financial Review reports. Less than 2% of WA’s population are accounting for nearly half of all Covid-19 hospital admissions due to not being vaccinated, the West Australian claims.

3/10/2022,"Colin Kaepernick’s decision to start taking the knee during the national anthem playout at NFL games in 2016 shook the world of American football. The birth of his activism gives the backdrop to Pravin Wilkins’ Theatre503 international playwriting award-winning play. News of Kaepernick’s protest ripples through the locker room and on to the field. Still, Chicano star running back Luis Moreno (Sebastián Capitán Viveros) is more bothered by his growing fame and fortune than engaging with a “wokeness fashion statement”. That is until the popularity of Donald Trump’s electoral campaign results in his mother’s taco shop being graffitied with the slur “Build the wall”, when he, too, feels compelled to make a public revolt in support of his community. Wilkins’ play morphs into a nuanced analysis of different ethnic minorities’ experiences of racism. As Luis’ anger spills out in a camera-flashing press conference, the team’s politically minded defender Ezekiel (Joseph Black) wonders why it has taken him so long to find his voice. “This protest has been going on for months,” Ezekiel presses, “now you want to insert yourself right in the middle?” Questions are raised over the right time and space to make a stand, and astute perspective comes as Ezekiel considers how to get “mythical conscientious white folk” on side. But it takes a while to get here. The play’s first half is bloated by marathon set-up scenes that do little to push the pace. Much of the early drama feels like filler and the attempted stylised execution doesn’t come off. There is a sense of stagnation to Nancy Medina’s direction, too. Long pauses are favoured as a technique to build tension. An initially comical moment where the youngest team member, Cre’von (Hayden Mclean), frustratingly packs his bag is stretched so far the audience’s laughs mutate into silence. A pity, as it sucks the vitality that is needed to keep the script moving. Nevertheless, this is a commendable debut. Carried by a sprightly cast, Wilkins’ writing feels fresh in its focus on racism in sport. He is an emerging talent we can expect to climb the ranks. Moreno is at Theatre503, London, until 26 March",Arts/Stage,Moreno review – Colin Kaepernick’s decision to take the knee causes ripples,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/09/moreno-review-colin-kaepernicks-decision-to-take-the-knee-causes-ripples
3/10/2022,"Abutterfly flapped its wings last June and nine months later sport is still dealing with the fallout. It happened when Dr Steve Haake, a professor of Sports Engineering at Sheffield Hallam University, was confronted with a case of self-plagiarism committed by a contributor in a set of conference proceedings he had edited in 2006. It got Haake thinking about a similar incident in his life from around the same time. In 2000, he wrote an article called Physics, Technology and the Olympics, for Physics World. In 2012, he was surprised to find much of that same article repeated, verbatim, in an editorial published in 2005 by the editor in chief of the British Journal of Sports Medicine, Dr Paul McCrory. After dealing with the one old case, Haake decided, at last, to do something about the other. You may not have heard of McCrory – Haake didn’t know much about him either – but if you have played or watched a contact or collision sport in the last 20 years he has had a hand in your pastime. McCrory was a founder member, and the co-chair, of the Concussion in Sport Group. They produce a consensus statement which is supposed to sum up the existing research into concussion, and which shapes medical practice in the field across grassroots and professional sport. They are funded by World Rugby, the IOC and Fifa, among others. McCrory has been one of the most influential figures in the field for the last 20 years. The BJSM eventually agreed with Haake that there was a “significant overlap” between the two pieces. McCrory explained that it had been an editing error, that a draft version of his article had been uploaded by mistake. And that is where the matter might have rested. But the story was picked up by an organisation called Retraction Watch, where it caught the attention of an academic named Nick Brown. Brown describes himself as “a self-appointed data police cadet”. He and friend James Heathers had previously exposed flaws in the work of the former Cornell professor Brian Wansink, among others. Brown decided to start digging into McCrory’s back catalogue. He soon found more articles that contained similar “significant overlaps” with other publications. Within hours of these coming to light, McCrory had stepped down from CISG. One of CISG’s key roles is to evaluate new concussion research. It’s a job that requires the trust of the community of people doing the research, especially since CISG uses such strict eligibility criteria. That strictness is ostensibly why they have always adopted such a conservative position on the risks of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. It says there is not enough proof. According to the group’s most recent consensus statement, it’s still not possible to say that there is “a cause-and-effect relationship” between CTE and concussion. McCrory was the lead author. The chain of events that followed Haake’s decision to deal with that one case of plagiarism from 2005 has left the governing bodies that relied on CISG in the years since having to explain why they invested so much stock in their work and decide whether they will continue to stand by it. The group’s credibility, which had already been called into question by campaign groups and politicians during the DCMS hearings into concussion in sport last year, is at an all-time low. Their latest conference, which has already been postponed twice, is due to be held in Amsterdam later this year. This is a problem for World Rugby in particular, and not just because of their involvement in the legal test cases about how their sport handled concussion in the years they were being guided by CISG. Rugby union’s governing body currently operates a six-day return-to-play protocol, meaning it’s possible for a player to be concussed one Saturday, and, if symptom-free, they can be back playing by the following Saturday (although in practice players are often out for much longer). It used to have a mandatory three-week stand-down for concussed players, but this was changed to bring it in line with the recommendations made by CISG in their 2012 consensus paper, of which, again, McCrory was the lead author. In the last year the AFL has increased its return-to-play period to 12 days and the Rugby Football League increased its return-to-play period to 11 days. World Rugby has come under pressure to increase its return-to-play too, but hasn’t – it says this is because of a belief that a blanket time-limit would mean that players start under-reporting symptoms (if they are right about that, it suggests they still have more work to do on their player-education programmes because the players still don’t understand exactly what’s at stake, although, given that last CISG Consensus statement questions the link between CTE and concussion, they are not alone in that). What World Rugby has done instead is adopt what it describes as a more “individualised” approach to the issue, in which the time it takes to return-to-play is decided on a case-by-case basis. This shift, which is in line with the advice from their independent concussion working group, suggests it is already trying to put distance between itself and the policies laid out by CISG, which they relied on for so long. This “individualised” approach is fine in theory, but in practice inevitably leads to inconsistencies in the way concussed players are managed. If it’s going to work, everyone involved, especially players, former players and their families, has to have complete faith in all the different processes the sport is using to diagnose concussions and manage the return to play. Given these are the same systems that allowed Tomas Francis to play on after he showed evidence of concussion against England, and which have allowed Wales to say they are happy to pick him again to play tomorrow even though he had a previous concussion in November, that is not the case.",Sport/Sport,How a plagiarism problem has started to shift rugby’s concussion protocols | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/09/how-a-plagiarism-problem-has-started-to-shift-rugbys-concussion-protocols
3/10/2022,"If you are a member of the board of British American Tobacco, courting popularity was probably never a top personal priority. Even so, the people overseeing a large and widely-held FTSE 100 company might still feel obliged to explain why, amid the broad boycott of Russia by multinationals, they think it’s fine to carry on business in the country roughly as normal. A statement attributed by BAT to “a spokesperson” strained to create the impression of change, but any specific action was lost in a fog of corporate-speak. Suspending an unspecified sum of capital expenditure, “rationalising” marketing activities and “scaling our business activities appropriate to the current situation” commits the company to very little. BAT’s bottom line is this: “Our business in Russia continues to operate”. In other words, a large factory in St Petersburg will keep producing Lucky Strikes, Kents, Rothmans and Dunhills, and a head office in Moscow, plus 75 regional offices, will continue to distribute. BAT accounts for about a quarter of the cigarette market in Russia. Naturally, BAT included a line about its “duty of care” to 2,500 local employees. But other large companies selling consumer inessentials have concluded that their equivalent duties are best fulfilled by suspending operations while continuing to pay the workers. What they want to avoid is paying tax revenues to Putin’s regime. And remember, in the tobacco industry, excise revenues also apply. The FTSE 100’s other fag merchant, Imperial Brands, with 1,000 local employees, has opted for a clear suspension of activities. Unlike BAT, Imperial is halting production in its Russian factory and is stopping all sales and marketing. It is not messing about with “rationalising” and “scaling”. One can only conclude that BAT (corporate slogan: “building a better tomorrow”) cares less about its contribution to Putin’s coffers. If Luc Jobin, BAT’s chairman, feels that interpretation is unfair, he is free to speak for himself. You want more bad news about energy prices? Here’s a contender: Ofgem gave itself powers last month to hike the price cap before the next scheduled update in October. So, theoretically at least, the widely-predicted £3,000-ish could arrive early. Ofgem called its new tool an “in-period adjustment”. The power to adjust the cap more frequently than every six months flowed from the perceived need to keep consumers’ bills and energy firms’ costs roughly in step when wholesale price are soaring or plunging violently. Exceptional adjustments would be made only in exceptional circumstances, Ofgem advised, helpfully providing a checklist of five criteria. The trouble is, the first three would seem to have been met already. The latest explosion in gas prices has been caused by a “rare” event that is “external” to UK energy suppliers and was “not reasonably avoidable” by them. Ofgem would still have to consider if an adjustment is “appropriate” and “urgently” required, but the new powers could almost have been designed for today’s wild market. The regulator has no current plans to do anything, it should be said, and can’t anyway before the new £1,977 cap comes into force at the start of next month. Thereafter, though, Jonathan Brearley, the regulator’s chief executive, has the technical authority to make himself the most unpopular man in the country. Such a move would not be career-enhancing, the chancellor may wish to mention. National Express’s planned all-share takeover of bus and coach rival Stagecoach was announced last autumn – so long ago that shareholders dozing on the back seats may have assumed the deal had completed by now. Well it hasn’t, and now looks unlikely to do so. German infrastructure fund DWS has turned up with a £595m offer for Stagecoach that is superior on three counts. First, it’s in cash, which is nice to have in current nervous markets. Second, it’s pitched at a 37% premium to where Stagecoach’s shares stood on Tuesday. Third, there are no competition concerns, the reason for the delays so far. It’s slightly odd that DWS has waited months to move, but the working-from-home effect on the UK’s new national bus strategy probably took a while to assess. As for National Express, a company where nothing ever seems straightforward, it must surely know that attempting to sweeten its offer is a non-starter. The 25% rise in its own share price suggests its investors never much liked the Stagecoach adventure anyway.",News/Business,Beyond the smoke screen it’s business as usual in Russia for British American Tobacco,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/09/beyond-the-smoke-screen-its-business-as-usual-in-russia-for-british-american-tobacco
3/10/2022,"The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said Vladimir Putin will fail in his effort to subjugate Ukraine, and will instead lead Russia into a “strategic defeat” that is already unfolding. Blinken was talking at a press conference with the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, at which both pledged to keep up security and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. “I’m absolutely convinced that Putin will fail, and Russia will suffer a strategic defeat no matter what short-term tactical gains it may make in Ukraine,” the secretary of state said. “You can win a battle, but that doesn’t mean you win the war. On the contrary, you can take a city but you can’t take the hearts and minds of its people and Ukrainians are demonstrating that every single day.” “We’ve already seen that Russia has failed in its chief objectives,” he added. “It’s not been able to hold Ukraine. It’s not going to be able to hold Ukraine in the long term.” Blinken said that Putin “has a clear plan to brutalise Ukraine, but to what end? He is now turning to a strategy of laying waste” Ukrainian cities. He warned that if even if Putin succeeded in installing a puppet regime in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, Ukrainians would never acquiesce. “I think it’s pretty evident that they will never accept that,” he said. Blinken also tried to explain the fiasco on Tuesday surrounding the plan to deliver Polish MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. The US had previously given a green light to Poland to supply the planes to Ukraine, saying it would replace them by providing more modern US fighter jets to the Polish air force. On Tuesday, Poland announced it would hand all its MiG-29s to the US at the Ramstein airbase in Germany, taking Washington by surprise. Within hours the Pentagon said the plan was not tenable. “I think what we’re seeing is that Poland’s proposal shows that there are some complexities that the issue presents when it comes to providing security assistance. We have to make sure that we’re doing it in the right way,” Blinken said. The Russian defence ministry has said that any country that provided bases from which Ukrainian war planes took off from to attack Russian forces would be considered as being involved in the conflict. “Departing from a US Nato base in Germany to fly into airspace contested with Russia over Ukraine raises some serious concerns for the entire Nato alliance,” Blinken said. “So we have to work through the specifics of these things going forward. It’s simply not clear to us that there’s a substantive rationale for doing it in the way that was put forward yesterday.” Both Blinken and Truss were questioned about the Ukrainian demands to establish no-fly zones over Ukraine, or at least over humanitarian corridors inside the country. Both ruled it out. “The reality is that setting up a no-fly zone would lead to a direct confrontation between Nato and Russia, and that is not what we are looking at,” Truss said, and pointed out the announcement on Wednesday that the UK would supply the Ukrainian armed forces with the Starstreak anti-aircraft system. “What we are looking at is making sure that the Ukrainians are able to defend their own country with the best possible selection of anti-tank weapons and anti-[aircraft] systems.” Blinken said: “If I were in President Zelenskiy’s position, I’m sure I would be asking for everything possible, in his mind, to help the Ukrainian people. But he added: “Both of our countries and so many others, have done extraordinary things to make sure that the Ukrainians have in their hands the means to effectively defend themselves against this war of choice from Russia.”",News/World news,"Putin will lead Russia to strategic defeat in Ukraine, says Blinken",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/putin-will-lead-russia-to-strategic-defeat-in-ukraine-says-blinken
3/10/2022,"The actor Stewart Bevan, who has died aged 73 after a short illness, was a welcome presence on British television over the years. A fresh-faced juvenile lead, later a reassuring and genial character player, he gave solid performances that were grounded in reality but not without flair. He featured in the long-running series Doctor Who, in 1973’s The Green Death, remembered fondly by viewers as “the one with the giant maggots”. The departure of popular companion Jo Grant (Katy Manning) called for someone special to lure her away from third Doctor, Jon Pertwee, and to this end the charismatic Welsh eco-warrior Professor Clifford Jones was conceived. Michael Briant, the director, was having trouble casting this part but was reluctant to interview Bevan because he was Manning’s fiance at the time. He finally relented and discovered that Bevan was exactly what he was looking for: handsome and with the requisite crusading zeal and lightness of touch. Bevan’s obvious rapport with Manning also helped to make her departure one of the series’ most memorably tear-jerking. Bevan himself was an empathic anti-capitalist vegetarian, guitar player and writer of poetry – all of which contributed to making Jones a believable character. Although he and Manning had split up in 1976 he reunited with her to play Cliff in a couple of short films used as trailers for the 2019 and 2020 Blu-ray releases of Pertwee’s Doctor Who episodes and for a retrospective documentary, Keeping Up With the Joneses (2019). Stewart was born in St Pancras, central London, to a canteen manager, Gwen (nee Snow), and truck driver, Ray Bevan, who became the personal driver to the celebrity hairdresser Raymond Bessone (aka Mr Teasy Weasy), while Gwen became his housekeeper. Raised in Southall, Middlesex, Stewart walked out of his school aged 15 after he was caned for standing up for a Sikh classmate. Working at Pierre Cardin’s London fashion store he attended amateur dramatics classes and was emboldened when he won an award for playing Alec in Noël Coward’s Still Life at a drama festival held at the Questors theatre in 1964, and so enrolled at the Corona theatre school. On only his second day there he auditioned to play a schoolboy in the landmark Sidney Poitier film To Sir, With Love (1966) and in 1967 worked as a dancer with Jayne Mansfield when she toured the UK in cabaret. He was soon getting big-screen credits – including Lock Up Your Daughters! (1969), the horror films Burke & Hare and The Flesh and Blood Show (both 1972), Steptoe and Son Ride Again (1973), The Ghoul (1975), and the John Wayne vehicle Brannigan (1975). After Doctor Who he appeared in many popular drama series – from Public Eye (1975) to Silent Witness (1997) via Shoestring (three episodes, all 1979), Blake’s 7 (1980) and The House of Elliot (1994). He had a stint in the soap opera Emmerdale (1977, then called Emmerdale Farm) as Ray Oswell, caught in a storm and seeking help with his pregnant wife, played by Virginia Moore. He and Virginia fell in love off-screen and they remained together for the rest of his life, settling in Suffolk. He also featured in Douglas Camfield’s all-star TV version of Ivanhoe (1982) and Noel’s House Party (1993-94) – which required sharp improvisational skills in order to pull off elaborate pranks on unsuspecting victims. He was also a familiar face on TV adverts – in the 80s for Fairy Liquid and the 90s for Kellogg’s Bran Flakes. His theatre highlights were his West End debut in the first production of Conduct Unbecoming (Queen’s theatre, 1969-70), taking the lead role when the play toured the UK in 1971, and touring with David Soul in Ira Levin’s Deathtrap in 2002. His last film role came in the Jack Thorne-scripted The Scouting Book for Boys (2009). He is survived by Virginia and their daughters, Coral and Wendy. His three sisters predeceased him.

3/10/2022,"When a Russian spokeswoman took to a podium in Moscow on Wednesday and warned of a “biological weapons programme” in Ukraine, fighters on another battlefield – Syria – understood what she meant. The anti-Assad opposition groups that still held northern Syria had heard it all before. From 2015, when Russia took a prominent stake in the conflict, and throughout the gruesome years that followed, claims that they, instead of the Assad regime, had used chemical weapons were a ready-made slur that put them on notice of an imminent assault. The allegations were made by Moscow, whenever ground forces it was supporting wanted to clear a town or city. Brutal, indiscriminate bombardment followed. So did impunity. Even in its infancy, the Russian war in Ukraine has many parallels with the conflict in Syria: barely restrained savagery, the mass flight of terrified civilians, and wanton destruction. Now the use of foreboding pretexts can be added to a growing list, which was born amid the ruins of Grozny, Crimea and Donbas and fine-tuned on the civilian population of Syria’s beleaguered north. The Pentagon and Ukraine’s leadership both disdainfully denied the Russian claim, which had been accompanied by a call for answers, and there seemed little likelihood of it cutting through an international discourse that has run heavily against the Kremlin and its disinformation programmes. It was a very different story in Syria, where each claim of chemical weapons use by rebels was received with credulity in parts of the UK and Europe and there was little interest in exposing Moscow’s lies. Winning the war of misinformation was a Russian success in Syria, in a theatre that wasn’t short of wins for a military with no-one apart from outgunned rebels and jihadists willing to stand in its way. “Ukraine today is part of a much longer continuum than Syria,” a former senior Nato officer told the Guardian. “It goes back further than Chechnya – politically, in terms of foreign policy, in terms of Russia’s internal dynamics and in terms of the tactics of the Russian war machine. The only surprise over the past fortnight is quite how useless the Russian armed forces have been – thankfully. They have been utterly dire in every respect, which is very good news all round. “We are all victims of our experience, and Putin’s experience is of being able to get away with almost anything he wants in every dimension of warfare. The blatant fostering of frozen conflicts in high-profile nations such as Georgia and Ukraine, the widespread and hardly concealed undermining of governance through hybrid warfare, the use of the most brutal tactics, crushing of whole towns and cities along with their populations. “His experience is that you can grind out a win using heavy explosives in the full glare of western media attention. And with an extremely effective control of his own [patriotic] population, he has little to fear at home.” Compared to the quagmire it has found in Ukraine and the blistering international reaction to its invasion, Syria was a relatively low-cost intervention for Moscow. Its pilots ran bombing runs without serious fear of being shot from the skies, its heavy weaponry had the run of towns and cities and its disinformation machine won at a canter. “The scope of the Ukraine war is different,” said Charles Lister, the director of the Syria and counter-terrorism programme at the Middle East Institute. “But some of the tactics were definitely learned and deployed in Syria. “The broad assumption of impunity unquestionably drove this forward and put Putin in a psychological position where he believed something like this was feasible. He learned to pay no regard to international red lines. The sustained and overwhelming use of heavy bombardment aimed at undermining public confidence and as a tool of intimidation now being seen in Mariupol was honed in Syria, where Russia barely used precision-guided munitions. “The vast majority have been dumb bombs. To use these, they need to fly at a lower level. And that’s why we are seeing Russian planes shot down, by Stingers and other ground-to-air missiles that were not supplied to the rebels in Syria.” Another parallel has emerged in recent days – an often cynical use of human corridors as tools of coercion. “It is the shock and awe effect on the population, and one that leads to a greater number of war crimes. “We saw this in Aleppo and now we are seeing it in places like Mariupol. It is clearly a tactic of intimidation and subjugation. … In both cases, it’s shell to hell, surround and besiege, then shell to hell again and offer concessions.”",News/World news,Russia’s ‘warning’ of Ukraine’s biological weapons sounds just like Syria,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/russias-warning-of-ukraines-biological-weapons-sounds-just-like-syria
