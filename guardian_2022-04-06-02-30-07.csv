4/6/2022,"Given the day’s importance and the many long months he and his family had dreamed of it, Jorge would probably have preferred a special guest appearance by Tony Stark, Dr Bruce Banner or Marshall the fire pup from Paw Patrol. Or, better still, all three. But in the end he had to make do with a surprise visit from Pedro Sánchez. At 12.45pm, on Tuesday, surrounded by friends, teachers – and Spain’s prime minister – Jorge fulfilled the biggest ambition of his 12 years by standing up, walking over to his classmates, and playing with them. To do so, Jorge, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, was placed into the state-of-the-art exoskeleton that has changed his life over the past two years, and which could offer millions of children a previously unthinkable degree of movement. Jorge’s mother, Eva Muñoz-Torrero, said she would never forget the first time he put on the exoskeleton: “He said, ‘You can keep the wheelchair. I’m having this now and I’m taking it home’.” Ever since then, he had begged to be able to take the equipment out of the therapy room he visits twice a week and into his school just outside Madrid. On his 12th birthday, Jorge got his wish. As he walked into the room where his friends were waiting, he was met with cheers, applause, and the tears that glossed the eyes of a stocky, bullet-headed member of the prime minister’s security detail. Marsi Bionics, the company that designed the exoskeleton, describes the kit as “the only paediatric exoskeleton in the world that allows the child to move around freely”, and says its uniqueness lies in the elastic technology that adapts to the user’s body. The firm, which has been running a clinical trial with Madrid’s La Paz hospital and Spain’s National Research Council, says the equipment could help the 17 million children worldwide whose neurological impairments prevent them from walking. “There’s nothing more beautiful than seeing a child in their school and playing with their friends,” said Elena García, the co-founder and CEO. But the enormous potential the exoskeleton offers doesn’t come cheap. While Jorge’s family has managed to cover the costs of the therapy – which can reach €30,000 a year – through crowdfunding, not everyone is so fortunate. “The exoskeleton is a dream but it’s not right that it should only be available to families who can arrange crowdfunding and a massive investment so that their child can walk,” said Muñoz-Torrero. She would like more families to be able to witness the changes she has seen in her son. Although Jorge has never lacked discipline, determination or an unflagging sense of humour, the exoskeleton has given him and the family a massive motivational boost. “It’s also really raised Jorge’s self-esteem,” she said. “He doesn’t want to sit in his chair in a corner. He wants to get involved.” Once the presents had been given, the piñata looted and the happy birthdays sung, Jorge went back to class in his wheelchair. As the prime minister and his retinue departed and the TV cameras beckoned, Muñoz-Torrero offered a brief summary of the morning’s achievements. “This has been a really important step because we’ve shown how important it is to get technology to people with disabilities,” she said. “But, more personally, this was what Jorge had wanted since the first day: he wanted to have his friends at his side as he stood up and walked. And he’s fulfilled that dream.”",News/World news,‘It’s a dream’: exoskeleton allows boy to walk and play,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/its-a-dream-exoskeleton-allows-boy-to-walk-and-play
4/6/2022,"The world economy may be on the cusp of a new inflationary era with persistently higher growth in consumer prices due to the retreat of globalisation, a leading central bank chief has said. Agustín Carstens, the head of the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements – which is known as the central bank of central banks – said there was a strong risk that prices would rise uncontrollably without a sharp rise in interest rates above existing plans. In a speech setting out risks for persistently higher rates of inflation, Carstens said higher borrowing costs could be required for several years to curb the risk of spiralling prices wreaking long-term damage on the economies of the industrialised world. However, his comments are debated as other experts warn high inflation will probably choke consumer spending and economic growth – reducing the urgency for significantly higher interest rates. Data has shown inflation heading towards 10% in several countries, mostly in response to rising gas and oil prices after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. In February, the consumer prices index hit 6.2% in the UK – the highest level since the 1990s. In March, the CPI in Germany and Spain hit 7.3% and 9.8% respectively. The Bank of England is on course to raise its base rate to 2% next year according to City investors, up from the current level of 0.75% after Threadneedle Street began hiking rates from a record low of 0.1% in December last year. Last month the US Federal Reserve approved a 0.25 percentage point hike from near zero, the first increase since December 2018, with a signal it plans several more rate rises this year. Carstens said a trend for manufacturers to cut back extensive global supply chains in response to the pre-pandemic trade war between the US and China and, more recently, sanctions on Russia, meant production costs would be higher for a longer period than central banks and independent economists currently estimate. “What starts as temporary can become entrenched, as behaviour adapts if what starts that way goes far enough and lasts long enough. It’s hard to establish where that threshold lies, and we may find out only after it has been crossed,” he said. Carstens’ speech in Geneva challenges the outlook put forward by the Bank of England, which estimates that inflation should begin to fall next year after only a modest rise in interest rates. Earlier this week, the Bank’s deputy governor, Jon Cunliffe, suggested comparisons with the 1970s when inflation was persistently higher were unrealistic. He said changes to the UK labour market since the 1970s – when trade union membership was at its peak – meant workers do not have the same power to demand higher wages to compensate for higher inflation. This would make it unlikely for the UK to experience a wage-price spiral, whereby workers demanding higher pay leads companies to raise their prices. Unlike Carstens, who said there was a risk of high inflation becoming entrenched in the public consciousness, Cunliffe said there were few signs of this so far. “I do not think we are yet seeing a psychology of persistently higher inflation emerge,” he said. “I am not at present convinced that we will inevitably have to lean heavily and constantly against an embedding of an inflationary psychology,” he added.",News/Business,"World may be on cusp of new inflationary era, says central bank chief",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/05/world-may-be-on-cusp-of-new-inflationary-era-says-central-bank-chief
4/6/2022,"The managing director of Manchester airport has quit following weeks of chaos in which thousands of passengers have missed their flights because of queues lasting up to seven hours. Karen Smart stepped down on Tuesday after coming under fierce criticism from airport staff as well as angry travellers. She had been in post for two years, the most turbulent time in aviation history. “Having taken on the position at the start of the pandemic, she has decided now is the time to return to the south of England, where her family is based, to pursue fresh career opportunities,” Manchester Airports Group (MAG) said in a statement. Ian Costigan, MAG group transformation director, will take on the role of interim managing director and will be responsible for delivering the programmes of recruitment needed to increase operational capacity over the summer. Smart had been due to meet Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester on Tuesday, as well as Unite, the union. Travellers have faced long delays and chaotic scenes with queues trailing outside terminals to reach check-in and hordes of people waiting to get through security and to pick up luggage. One man told the BBC on Sunday that he waited seven hours missing his flight, and saw “sick on the floor with no one clearing it up” as people queued in a “boiling hot confined area”. Piles of suitcases have been left in terminals after travellers abandoned the wait to reclaim their baggage and instead left for home. One airport worker publicly quit this week over what he called “dangerous” and “chaotic” operations. Ray Ellis, who had worked at Manchester airport since 1994 and had been a health and safety rep, said he was speaking out because he was “genuinely concerned for passenger safety”. The airport, along with much of the aviation industry, has struggled to recruit staff made redundant after the pandemic shutdown airports and travel. As the Easter getaway increases travel, similar problems have hit other airports including Heathrow and Birmingham. More than 1,000 UK flights have been axed in recent days due to crews being off sick amid a rise in coronavirus cases. Industry experts also said airlines and airports were struggling because of the number of job cuts made during the pandemic. John O’Neill, north-west regional industrial officer for Unite, said after mass redundancies due to Covid, some workers had found alternative jobs with similar wages and might not be willing to return to work at the airport doing unsociable hours for similar rates of pay. O’Neill said: “There is a huge problem with recruitment, a massive problem with recruitment. This is the test for summer, the Easter break, is the test for summer. Summer is going to be far worse than this. It is the time to get everything in place otherwise summer is going to very difficult.” MAG, which also runs Stansted and East Midlands airport, is partly owned by the 10 local authorities of Greater Manchester, with the biggest stake held by Manchester council. The Australian investment firm IFM Investors also owns a 35% stake. The MAG airport website is currently offering jobs for drivers with a starting salary of £13,000 a year and security “ambassador” jobs targeted to students paying £10.53 an hour, including night shifts, 3am starts, weekends and bank holidays. The chief executive of MAG, Charlie Cornish, said: “Over the last two years, Karen has guided Manchester airport through the most challenging period of its 84-year history, having made a major contribution to MAG throughout her time with the business. “I am sorry to lose Karen after her years of valuable service, but also understand her desire to return to the south for family reasons and indeed to explore new career opportunities. “While there are sure to be further challenges ahead, I am confident we will soon start to see the benefits of the recovery plans Karen has helped put in place and look forward to working with Ian and his leadership team to drive them forward.”",News/UK news,Manchester airport manager quits after weeks of chaos,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/05/manchester-airport-manager-quits-after-weeks-of-chaos
4/6/2022,"Britain will work with the US and Australia in developing nuclear-capable hypersonic weapons, after Russia used the deadly high-speed missiles in airstrikes last month during the war in Ukraine. The military agreement – endorsed by Joe Biden, Boris Johnson and the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison – is a new element in the Aukus pact, originally announced last autumn to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Canberra. A statement from all three leaders announced a further expansion of the agreement, described as “new trilateral cooperation on hypersonics and counter-hypersonic” weapons, part of a growing militarisation after the Russian invasion. China has tested its own version of the weapons, and the Aukus leaders are keen to be seen to be presenting a united front against Beijing and Moscow. “Our ability to determine their use and to counter their use will be important part of maintaining stability right across the world,” a British official said. The US quietly tested its own hypersonic missile last month, although it kept details secret for a fortnight for fear of antagonising Russia, and it is already collaborating with Australia. The agreement means Britain is now engaged for the first time. Hypersonic missiles – whether nuclear or not – travel at at least five times the speed of sound, faster than conventional cruise missiles. They are designed to be manoeuvrable, allowing them, in theory, to evade conventional missile defences. However, it is unclear if they have any genuine military utility, and critics say their development is contributing to a deepening international rearmament in response to the Ukraine crisis. Biden said last month that Russia had used its Kinzhal hypersonic missile against Ukrainian targets, describing it as “a consequential weapon” that was “almost impossible to stop”. Russia said it had used them twice, against targets near Mykolaiv and elsewhere in the west of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has previously praised the Kinzhal and weapons like it, saying four years ago that “its speed makes it invulnerable” and that it was “quite understandable why the leading armies of the world seek to possess such an ideal weapon”. But others have voiced scepticism. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said he would “not see it as a gamechanger”, and other experts see them simply as modified versions of Russian Iskander ballistic missiles, which are launched from a plane against a target. China has been testing hypersonic weapons using a different technology, known as the hypersonic glide vehicle, in which the missiles are initially launched into space and then attached to dedicated aerodynamic craft designed to bring them down to their targets on Earth. The UK, US and Australia intend to work on researching both types of hypersonic technology – missiles and glide vehicles – and examine ways of countering the threat they may pose. “We need to understand how the overall targeting system of our adversaries might work,” a British official said. Pentagon officials have assessed that hypersonic weapons will add $21.5bn (£16.4bn) to the navy’s budget and $7bn to the army’s in coming years, although the estimates are tentative as the technology emerges. British sources, however, said the UK had not committed to buying any hypersonic weapons, and is only engaged in a research and development phase before deciding how to proceed. Kate Hudson, the general secretary of the pressure group CND, said she believed the extension of the Aukus pact would “further escalate global tensions at a time when the threat of nuclear war is at its highest in decades”, and it risked accelerating an arms race with China in the Asia-Pacific. “Not to mention the fact that military budgets are already escalating – what will the opportunity cost be for embarking on a whole new class of weaponry?” Hudson added. The joint progress report will be seen as politically helpful to Morrison, whose Coalition government in Canberra is trailing Labor in the polls as it prepares for a federal election expected on 14 or 21 May. Morrison, who is expected to formally trigger the election campaign within days, is seeking to make national security one of his key themes, arguing that the world is facing “uncertain times” and it is not a moment for “weakness”.",News/Politics,Aukus pact extended to development of hypersonic weapons,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/05/aukus-pact-extended-to-development-of-hypersonic-weapons
4/6/2022,"The D-day veteran Harry Billinge, who at 18 was one of the first British soldiers to land on Gold beach in 1944, has died the age of 96 after a short illness, his family have said. As a sapper attached to the 44 Royal Engineer Commandos, Billinge was one of only four men from his 10-man unit to survive the landings and subsequent battles in France, later fighting in Caen and the Falaise pocket in Normandy. He settled in Cornwall and went on to raise more than £50,000 for veterans, including for a national memorial honouring his fallen comrades. He was made an MBE in 2019 for charitable fundraising, and he was also awarded France’s highest award, the Légion d’honneur. His daughter, Sally Billinge-Shandley, said: “He was a man that always gave his word, his word was solid. He always fought for what he believed in. The passion he had for all the veterans that lost their lives was unwavering. “How he dedicated his life to making sure that was never forgotten, that’s how he’ll be remembered. The memorial for the Normandy veterans just became part of him; it was just a huge part of his life. Some of his last words were: ‘Love one another.’” On being made an MBE, Billinge told BBC Breakfast: “I’m no hero, I was lucky, I’m here. All the heroes are dead and I’ll never forget them.” A proud cockney, he grew up in Petts Wood in Kent but had been in Cornwall for 70 years. He set up shop as a barber and became president of the local clubs for the Royal British Legion and Royal Engineers. He made annual pilgrimages to the cemeteries of Normandy. A tribute from British Normandy Memorial said: “The trust sends its deepest condolences to Harry’s wife, Sheila, and to all his family and friends.” In 2020 Billinge was “deeply moved” to have a Great Western Railway (GWR) intercity express train named after him to mark 75 years since the end of the war. Mark Hopwood, the GWR managing director, said: “We’re so sad to hear about the passing of our dear friend Harry Billinge MBE. It was our absolute honour to name one of our trains after him in October 2020 and we will never forget the impact he had on so many.” Billinge is survived by his wife, Shelia, to whom he was married for 67 years, two daughters Sally and Margot, son Christopher and granddaughters Amy and Claire.",News/UK news,D-day veteran and fundraiser Harry Billinge dies at 96,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/05/d-day-veteran-and-fundraiser-harry-billinge-dies-aged-96
4/6/2022,"Whatever the rights and wrongs of punishing NHS staff for mistakes (New law means future medical scandals could be missed, says NHS watchdog, 1 April), the government is ignoring a fundamental cause of the dreadful events described in the Ockenden report. Poor staffing can lead to problems such as a lack of listening and empathy, rudeness, mistakes and bullying. Imagine you are constantly rushing between too many labouring women, or “ignoring” a new mother’s buzzer because another is in floods of tears, or trying to monitor several abnormal foetal heart rates simultaneously. Is it surprising that your stress means you don’t listen properly, are unintentionally abrupt, miss something vital and are bullied by your manager, who is also stressed and bullied by theirs? You will be too exhausted, demoralised and scared to blow the whistle. Increased workforce numbers would help. The government has refused to take a vital step here, rejecting an amendment to the health and care bill that would have required it to publish an independent review of NHS workforce requirements every two years. The amendment was backed by Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the health select committee, and Simon Stevens, the former NHS England chief executive, but voted down in the Commons last week. The government has just cut £330m from the NHS budget, so of course it doesn’t want the inevitable demand for more money for staff and training that would undoubtedly be recommended in these workforce reviews. Yet £6bn is being spent on more expensive agency staff. So I beg MPs to vote for this amendment when it returns from the Lords.Gay LeeLondon  Avoidable baby and mother deaths are almost certainly not confined to Shrewsbury and Telford hospital NHS trust (Police examine 600 cases after damning NHS baby deaths report, 30 March). A factor common to all hospitals was the use of the number of caesarean sections as a negative performance indicator. Clearly, top-down pressure to minimise caesareans might override clinical judgment in individual cases. The use of this performance indicator has been criticised for over a decade, but it was not until February this year that NHS England and NHS Improvement said hospitals should no longer use “total caesarean section rates as a means of performance management” because it may lead to decisions that “may be clinically inappropriate or unsafe in individual cases”. In the time it took these august bodies to arrive at this glaringly obvious conclusion, at least 201 babies and nine mothers died unnecessarily in Shrewsbury and Telford, many because of resistance to performing caesarean sections. These deaths, and many others that have probably occurred at other trusts for the same reason, should be blamed largely on NHS England and, ultimately, successive health secretaries.Geoff RenshawLeamington Spa, Warwickshire  Re Gaby Hinsliff’s article (The horrific birth stories from Shrewsbury NHS trust are haunting.

Mine is the failure of most of broadcast and print media to report the continuing death toll from Covid. This plays into the hands of libertarians who care little about public health, still less about the hugely unequal distribution of those deaths, and fuels the myth that Covid is just another virus that we have to live with. Chiles’s distinction between “interesting” as the basis for what is newsworthy rather than “important” is spot-on. But he omits examples of dogged journalism that do keep a story alive precisely because it is important, such as Amelia Gentleman’s outstanding work on the Windrush scandal. I hope that someone of her calibre takes up the Covid death toll and keeps it in the public eye. Last week it was over 1,000.

Zoe has consistently been the country’s most reliable source of information about symptoms and virus prevalence over the entire pandemic, as well as providing an extraordinarily rich basis for future research.

4/6/2022,"Trevor Bayliss, the World Cup-winning former England head coach, has held talks with Cricket Australia over the vacancy left by Justin Langer’s post-Ashes departure in February. Bayliss, 59, is back at Lord’s this summer and will be reunited with Eoin Morgan, his England white-ball captain, having been named as the interim head coach of London Spirit in the Hundred following the death of Shane Warne last month. But while some have viewed this new role as a sign that Bayliss’s interest in coaching Australia is over, the Guardian understands discussions with CA took place last week as the governing body assesses its options. Andrew McDonald, Langer’s former assistant, is the front-runner to take over, having led the coaching staff during the recent tour of Pakistan that delivered a historic 1-0 Test series win. Though a 2-1 defeat in the one-day international leg of the trip followed, that result is unlikely to diminish his prospects. “[McDonald] is just a great operator,” Pat Cummins, Australia’s Test captain, said in the aftermath of that victory. “The boys absolutely love him. He’s very diligent, very thorough and strategic and organised. He’s a huge part of this tour win. It’s not my place to employ the coach but ‘Ronnie’ has been fantastic.” McDonald, 40, has similarly spoken to CA in the past week but stopped short of declaring his interest publicly when asked about it, revealing there was “no great detail or clarity on what the role would look like’’ during the talks. It appears Australia are still to decide whether the role of head coach should be split by way of Test and white-ball international cricket given the crowded fixture schedule, something the England and Wales Cricket Board is also considering for its men’s set-up once a new managing director is appointed. If so, it may be that Bayliss and McDonald – both known to be popular among the current Australia squad – find roles in a rejigged coaching set-up, with the former’s past success possibly leaning him towards the limited-overs teams.",Sport/Sport,Former England coach Bayliss holds talks with Cricket Australia over role,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/05/former-england-coach-bayliss-holds-talks-with-cricket-australia-over-role
4/6/2022,"A prominent Nigerian humanist has been sentenced to 24 years in prison after pleading guilty to blasphemy charges, in a landmark case that has put a new focus on the threats to freedom of expression in the west African country. Mubarak Bala, the president of the Humanist Association of Nigeria, was sentenced on Tuesday afternoon, two years after his arrest at his home in the northern Kaduna state on 28 April 2020. He was then taken to neighbouring Kano, where calls for action against him had been made by members of the religious establishment in the majority Muslim and conservative state. Bala, the son of a religious scholar in Kano, is an atheist who had been an outspoken religious critic in a staunchly conservative region. He faced death threats and calls for him to be tried for blasphemy after he posted comments critical of Islam on Facebook in April 2020. In court on Tuesday, to the surprise of his legal team, Bala requested to change his plea to guilty, one of his lawyers said. “Just suddenly, he changed his plea and pleaded guilty to the whole 18-count charges … We were in shock.” The lawyer said Bala might have seen the guilty plea as a way to end the case. “It feels like he felt he should just know his fate. He didn’t know when this would come to an end. He may have thought a guilty plea would lead to some leniency but the judgment was harsh,” he said. Leo Igwe, an associate of Bala’s and founder of the Humanist Association of Nigeria, said following the case: “Unfortunately this is a very sad day for humanism and for human rights in Nigeria. The implication is not good for the humanist movement, because it means that humanists will be, by implication, criminal.” Bala’s detention and treatment has been condemned by Humanists UK and UN human rights experts. Bala was detained without charge for a year, during which his whereabouts were unknown and he was denied contact with his lawyer or family for months. A high court in the capital, Abuja, ordered his release on bail but the ruling was ignored by Nigerian authorities in Kano and Kaduna. His case has been seen as an example of a clampdown on voices judged to be critical of religious orthodoxy, in a deeply conservative region. Bala had previously been forcibly committed into a psychiatric facility by his family in Kano, after he renounced Islam in 2014. Following Bala’s sentence, Igwe claimed that members of the religious establishment had likely threatened Bala to admit guilt. “He was under pressure to admit he was guilty and that otherwise he could die in prison. It was impressed on him by authorities in Kano that the only way his family could be safe was if he admitted that he was guilty, so even against legal advice he decided to agree and face the consequences.”",News/World news,Nigerian humanist jailed for 24 years after pleading guilty to blasphemy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/nigerian-humanist-mubarak-bala-receives-24-year-jail-sentence
4/6/2022,"The chair of the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association, Alex Wurz, has put F1 on notice that its drivers will no longer stay silent on issues such as where the sport races after they considered boycotting the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. The GPDA represents the 20 F1 drivers and the controversy in Saudi Arabia was, for Wurz, indicative of the sea change in the attitude of his members and across sport as a whole that has taken place recently. “We can see that sport has undergone a very swift change over the last few years,” he said. “It really came to the surface with the issue of racism and with Black Lives Matter. Before, drivers were seen as sportspeople where the position was: ‘I am a sportsperson, I am not getting involved in politics.’ That time has really gone. “In the last two to three years those young people have suddenly come to the position that they should have an opinion and that they should also talk and express their opinions and deal with their responsibility for it.” The Saudi GP was already a source of unease for drivers because of the state’s terrible human rights record. Then, a missile strike within six miles of the Jeddah circuit on the Friday before the race led to the drivers agreeing the race should be cancelled. They were ultimately placated but are expected to meet with F1 during or shortly after this weekend’s Australian GP to air their concerns about racing in Saudi Arabia. F1’s owners, who have the commercial rights to the sport and decide the calendar, are not going to cancel the hugely lucrative Saudi Arabian GP but that the drivers will require more input into how the sport is run now appears inevitable. F1 is invested in selling them as the stars of the show, a marketing tool that has worked well, however with it comes an emboldened generation who are aware of the potential power they wield. Wurz admired the way they acted collectively in Saudi Arabia but was not surprised that they did so. “It’s definitely very impressive to watch that they strongly came together,” he said. “As they did so over the last few years, but now it is demanded of athletes. The transformation of young people taking this responsibility is impressive. “We are talking about people who are dedicated to a professional life and they are going out and informing themselves and forming their opinions.”",Sport/Sport,"F1 will continue to speak out after Saudi chaos, says Drivers’ Association chair",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/05/f1-drivers-will-continue-to-speak-out-says-drivers-association-chair

A jazz-trained musician, Messina often did little more on a Motown record than play a chord on every backbeat, the second and fourth beats of each bar. But those downstrokes added a certain thickness and tone to beats already being given their weight by the snare drum and their cutting edge by a tambourine. The result was the kind of dancefloor propulsion heard on Martha and the Vandellas’ Dancing in the Street, the Miracles’ Going to a Go-Go, the Four Tops’ I Can’t Help Myself and Temptations’ (I Know) I’m Losing You, the sort of hits that would give Motown a vast international following. Long unknown by name or face to those who bought and danced to the million-selling records on which they played, the Motown session men finally made it into the public eye in 2002, when the award-winning documentary film Standing in the Shadows of Motown revealed their role. The film’s popularity resulted in live reunions that included shows at the Apollo theatre in Harlem, the Royal Festival Hall in London, the opening ceremony for the 2004 Ryder Cup golf tournament at Oakland Hills, just outside Detroit, and the White House, where they were hosted by President George W Bush. Many were surprised to see a white guitarist among the ranks of the Motown musicians. In the days when he sat between his fellow guitarists Robert White and Eddie Willis, both African Americans, churning out one hit after another in Motown’s Studio A, he liked to refer to himself, in the sort of joke that probably could not be made today, as “the cream in the Oreo cookie”. Born to Mary and Jasper Messina in Detroit, Joe attended the city’s Central high school and studied music at Cass Tech, the alma mater of many celebrated jazz musicians, before dropping out to pursue a professional career. From the late 1940s he played in Detroit’s jazz clubs and eventually landed a job with the band on the comedian Soupy Sales’ popular nightly TV show, broadcast nationally from a studio in midtown Detroit. A student of bebop, he was proud of playing with Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and Milt Jackson, among other visiting stars. At the beginning of the 60s, with the Motown sound in its infancy, Berry Gordy Jr, the company’s founder and president, assembled a cadre of skilled musicians who could be put on salary, guaranteeing their loyalty and their permanent availability for sessions run according to an around-the-clock schedule inspired by Detroit’s automobile production lines. Mickey Stevenson, Gordy’s head of A&R, recommended Messina, who soon found himself among musicians of the calibre of the drummer Benny Benjamin, the bassist James Jamerson, the keyboards players Earl Van Dyke, Joe Hunter and Johnny Griffith, the vibraphone and tambourine exponent Jack Ashford, and the percussionist Eddie “Bongo” Brown. Known to themselves as the Funk Brothers, they worked day after day in the studio they called the Snakepit. Producers and songwriters such as Stevenson, Smokey Robinson, Lamont Dozier and the brothers Eddie and Brian Holland would often arrive with nothing more than a snatch of melody and hum it to the musicians, who would come up with the framework – the introduction, the background riffs, the turnarounds – that transformed those fragments into gold records. None of the musicians would receive a penny in royalties for their contributions to records still being played six decades later. Although the three guitarists were all well-rounded players, each had his own speciality. White thumb-picked lyrical intros, Willis added a hint of the blues to the riffs, and Messina hit the backbeat with a plectrum on his customised guitar: a Fender Telecaster with a Jazzmaster neck, strung with heavy-gauge flatwound strings to emphasise the percussive effect. When Gordy moved the company to Hollywood in 1972, planning to continue making records there while breaking into the movie business, he left almost all his stalwart session musicians behind, many of them stranded without a regular income. Messina put down his guitar to concentrate on his investment in a car-wash business. Not until 2000, when the guitarist Allan Slutsky began approaching the old Motown musicians with the idea that eventually turned into the documentary, did he begin playing seriously again. In 2013 the surviving Funk Brothers gathered for the unveiling of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: a somewhat ironic accolade, given that Gordy’s Sunset Boulevard dreams had put an end to their work together. His wife, Josie, died in 2009; although a wheelchair user, she had accompanied him to all the Funk Brothers’ reunion gigs. He is survived by their son, Joel, their daughter, Janice, four grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
