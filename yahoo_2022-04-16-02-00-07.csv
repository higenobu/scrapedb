4/16/2022,"A British fighter captured by Russian forces in Ukraine appeared bloodied during an interview on Russian state TV. Aiden Aslin, 27, seemingly spoke under duress during the interview. Asline was fighting alongside Ukraine's armed forces in the besieged city of Mariupol when he was forced to surrender. A British fighter who was captured by Russian forces while fighting on behalf of Ukraine appeared battered and bloodied during an interview on Russian state TV as he parroted Russian propaganda. His family is now condemning his treatment in Russian custody, calling the possible beating ""shocking."" Aiden Aslin, 27, had been fighting alongside Ukraine's armed forces in the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol but was forced to surrender to Russian troops. ""It's been 48 days, we tried our best to defend Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian forces,"" read a tweet from Aslin's account on April 12 — an apparent relayed message from the UK man. ""We have no food and no ammunition. It's been a pleasure, everyone. I hope this war ends soon."" —COSSACKGUNDI (@cossackgundi) April 15, 2022 The British fighter from the town of Newark-on-Trent then appeared on Russian state TV on Friday with a visible gash on his forehead as he repeated Russian propaganda. ""From the first day when we arrived in Mariupol, I said that we should leave, because, as I said before, Donbas is recognized as independent, Luhansk also,"" Aslin was quoted as saying by Russian newspaper Izvestia. Izvestia also claimed Aslin urged Ukraine to recognize Russia's claims to Crimea, which Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded and annexed from Ukraine in 2014, Izvestia described Aslin as a ""mercenary,"" and during the interview, Aslin apparently referred to Ukrainian troops as ""criminals."" Aslin's Twitter account — which The Guardian previously reported is being run by a friend of his while he was in Ukraine — suggested Aslin had been coerced into making the statements as a ""victory lap"" for Russian media. The account posted a screenshot of Aslin from the interview and tweeted that it showed ""a better shot of the bashing they gave Aiden."" ""So far they're going through what we expected with recorded statements,"" the account added. ""Russian media are taking a victory lap. Perfectly happy for them to do that if it keeps my friend alive."" Another photo of Aslin tweeted from the account showed him in handcuffs wearing the same clothes he wore during the interview. —COSSACKGUNDI (@cossackgundi) April 14, 2022 Aslin's younger brother, Nathan, told British tabloid The Daily Mail that it was ""so shocking for our family to see Aiden in that state."" ""What have the Russians done to him? He looks awful, absolutely exhausted. His face is drained of color,"" Aslin's brother said, according to the news outlet. Aslin's mother, Angela Wood, pleaded for Putin's forces to treat her son with humanity, the Daily Mail reported. ""I'm in bits. I now hold Vladimir Putin to the terms of the Geneva Convention,"" Wood said, according to the Daily Mail. ""Aiden is a serving member of the Ukrainian armed forces and as such is a prisoner of war and must be treated with humanity."" Human rights groups have warned both Russia and Ukraine that parading prisoners of war before the media is a violation of international law. Translations by Oleksandr Vynogradov.

4/16/2022,"WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) — Infowars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones will be getting back the $75,000 in fines he paid to a Connecticut court for failing to appear at a deposition last month in a lawsuit over his assertions that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax, a judge has ruled. Relatives of some of the 20 children and six educators killed in the 2012 Newtown, Connecticut, massacre sued Jones for defamation, saying they have been subjected to harassment and death threats from Jones’ followers. A judge found Jones liable for damages, and a trial on how much he should pay the families is set for August. Judge Barbara Bellis in Waterbury ordered the return of the money Thursday, because Jones eventually did show at a rescheduled deposition last week. The fines, which escalated daily, were aimed at making sure Jones did appear for questioning. Jones said he missed the March 23 and 24 deposition in Austin, Texas — home to Jones and Infowars — because of a medical problem that included vertigo. He said his doctors first thought it was a serious heart issue, but it later turned out to be a sinus infection. Bellis said there wasn't enough evidence Jones was too ill to attend the deposition. Jones paid a $25,000 daily fine for April 1 and another $50,000 daily fine for April 4. He then attended a deposition in Bridgeport on April 5 and 6. A lawyer for the Sandy Hook families declined to comment Friday. A message was left for Jones' attorney. Jones was also found liable for damages in similar defamation lawsuits by victims' relatives in Texas, where a trial is set to start later this month. Jones has since said he believes the shooting did occur.",U.S./Associated Press,"Alex Jones to recoup $75,000 in fines in Sandy Hook lawsuit",https://news.yahoo.com/alex-jones-recoup-75-000-155955404.html
4/16/2022,"Somehow, the dumbbell front raise is commonly held to be an important exercise for shoulder workouts. The idea is to give your front delts some dedicated attention, so the exercise is often plugged into upper body splits. But once you look at your training from a functionality standpoint, the front raise has worn out its welcome. If you’re already doing plenty of presses for both chest, then adding this isolation move can be considered a bit of overkill on your anterior deltoids. That makes the exercise highly overrated, according to Men’s Health fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S., and Men’s Health Advisory Board member David Otey, C.S.C.S.. Even more than overrated, the front raise might do you more harm than good. The front raise actually incorporates the elbows, wrists, and hands to raise the load, and not in a way that's conducive to everyday, functional movements. When’s the last time you picked anything up with your arms fully extended? Worse, you put unnecessary stress on elbow joints with the front raise. “Even if you're thinking about building perfectly symmetrical shoulders, you're better off focusing on lateral raises, and rear delt raises,” Samuel says. “The front raise just isn't great bang for your buck.” So what to do instead? Try these shoulder suggestions instead. Although this exercise targets the lateral deltoid head, lateral raises are not a complete isolation exercise—they also incorporate surrounding muscles to help strengthen the entire shoulder. And when it comes to shoulder symmetry, the outer deltoid is more important. Shoot for three sets of three sets of 10 to 12 reps. Barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells—it doesn’t matter which you choose, any of press is more beneficial to your anterior delts than the front raise, according to Samuel and Otey. The primary function of the front delt is to press into an overhead position, and presses allow you to use a heavier load, which will help build up the front shoulder. When performed properly, presses allow your shoulders to work in a more natural way. Eight to 10 reps should be sufficient for this exercise. This bodyweight chest classic also hits the front delts in a safer way that will take some unnecessary stress off the shoulders. Try for three sets of as many reps as possible. “When it comes to symmetry, shoulders don't really happen unless your chest is there,” Samuel says. “So come off of the front raise. It's not worth it.” You Might Also Like This Workout Torches Fat in Under 10 Minutes How to Cool Down After Your Hardest Workouts What’s the Deal With Intermittent Fasting for Weight Loss?",Health/Men's Health,Stop Blasting Your Shoulders With Front Raises.

4/16/2022,"Russia failed to mobilize 26,000 reservists to fight in the Donbas, Ukraine's defense ministry said. That's because potential Russian recruits were afraid of becoming ""cannon fodder,"" the ministry said. Russia has lost multiple high-ranking officers in the face of surprisingly strong Ukrainian resistance. Russia is failing to recruit new troops because potential conscripts are too afraid of dying in battle, Ukraine's defense ministry told a Friday press briefing, citing military intelligence. Russia had planned to mobilize 26,000 reservists to fight in the Donbas, but this effort ultimately failed because Russians were avoiding being conscripted, defense ministry spokesman Col. Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told the briefing. ""Males aged 18 to 65 make every attempt to avoid mobilization because they don't want to become cannon fodder for the occupier's army,"" Motuzyanyk said. Ukraine's defense ministry claims it has killed about 20,000 soldiers and officers of the Russian army. This figure has not been independently verified. Motuzyanyk told reporters that potential recruits had been promised that their duties would include ""controlling occupied territories, guarding roads and military facilities, and improving the defense positions."" The reality, he said, is they have been forced into battle to replace those killed in combat. ""As practical experience shows, such mobilized people are the first priority reserve to replenish losses of those units who are directly engaged in combat action against Ukraine,"" Motuzyanyk said. Multiple reports in recent weeks have described low morale among Russian forces in Ukraine. The BBC reported earlier this week that Russia's losses in Ukraine included elite troops that take years and millions of dollars to train. Mikhail Benyash, a lawyer representing Russian national guardsmen who were fired for refusing to go to Ukraine, told the Financial Times that hundreds of people had gotten in touch with him looking for advice on avoiding the war.
