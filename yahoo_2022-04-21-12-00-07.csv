4/21/2022,"The Army has found its replacements for the M4 rifle and M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, handing out a contract to put new guns in the hands of tens of thousands of soldiers. The force is awarding a 10-year, $20.4 million contract to Sig Sauer for the XM5 Rifle, which will become the new standard rifle for soldiers, and the XM250 Automatic Rifle, which will replace the SAW. The service will also switch from 5.56mm ammo to 6.8mm, after a search for rounds better built to penetrate body armor.

""The new ammunition includes multiple types of tactical and training rounds that increase accuracy and are more lethal against emerging threats than both the 5.56mm and 7.62mm ammunition."" The news comes after a 27-month evaluation process in which other defense contractors, including General Dynamics, competed to be the Army's go-to small arms dealer. The weapons will include the XM157 Fire Control optic, which includes a laser range finder, ballistic calculator, visible and infrared lasers, and a compass. That optic is made by Vortex Optics. It's unclear how many weapons the Army aims to buy over the decade, or how quickly soldiers will totally ditch the decades-old SAW and rifle. In its proposed 2023 budget, the force is requesting 29,046 new weapons. But that budget still needs to be approved by Congress. -- Steve Beynon can be reached at Steve.Beynon@military.com.

4/21/2022,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Wednesday asked people to not buy or use certain dietary supplement products sold with variations of the names 'Artri' or 'Ortiga' as they may contain some potentially harmful ingredients not mentioned on their labels. The agency said its laboratory analyses revealed some of the products contain dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac sodium and methocarbamol, which is a muscle relaxant. The products are marketed to treat arthritis, muscle pain and other conditions and are sold online and in some retail stores, the agency said. The FDA said it found the hidden drug ingredients in Artri Ajo King, Artri King, Ortiga Mas Ajo Rey and Ortiga Mas Ajo Rey Extra Forte products. The FDA in January had first issued a warning about Artri Ajo King, asking consumers not to purchase the product sold for joint pain and arthritis on various websites, including Amazon.com. The agency said it has received reports of adverse events including of liver toxicity and death, associated with the use of Artri King products since the warning. The Artri King products are made by supplements maker NaturaMex. Dexamethasone could cause serious adverse events including infections and elevated sugar levels while diclofenac sodium could lead to heart attack and stroke or gastrointestinal damage, the FDA warned on Wednesday. Methocarbamol may cause dizziness and low blood pressure, it said.
