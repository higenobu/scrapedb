5/4/2022,"A manhunt across southeast Pennsylvania came to a tragic end on Monday afternoon with a mother behind bars and two school-aged boys on the verge of death. In a Monday afternoon news conference, Bucks County District Attorney Matt Weintraub said that Trinh T. Nguyen, 38, of Upper Makefield Township, was arrested and charged with shooting and critically wounding her sons, the Bucks County Courier Times reports. Nguyen’s charges will likely be upgraded to homicide because her sons, ages 9 and 13, are not expected to survive and are only being kept alive to facilitate organ donation, Weintraub said. According to a press release, the incident unfolded Monday morning when local police were notified of a startling altercation between the mother and her neighbor. Gianni Melchiondo, 22, was awoken by the sound of gunshots, Weintraub said. When Melchiondo went outside to investigate, he claims Nguyen approached him in the shared yard of their luxury duplexes and gave him a box of pictures to pass along to her ex-husband, who works with Melchiondo. She then pulled a gun and tried to fire but—“by the grace of God,” Weintraub said—the gun didn’t go off and the neighbor was able to wrest the weapon from Nguyen, who then fled, Weintraub said. When police arrived, they entered Nguyen’s house with the neighbor’s mother, who knew young boys lived in the home, the press release said. First responders found the boys in their beds—both had been shot in the head as they slept. Evidence inside the home also indicated that Nguyen had tried to kill herself, Weintraub said. The Courier Times reviewed court documents that revealed Nguyen had a recent history of domestic and financial turmoil. She was set to be evicted from her five-bedroom duplex by Tuesday if she didn’t voluntarily vacate. The documents reveal that she owed the homeowner, her ex-sister-in-law, at least $11,500 in rent, which a judge ordered her to pay in December. Nguyen continued living in the home after her ex-husband moved out; court documents reveal the couple divorced in October. A lawyer involved in the dispute wrote to Nguyen in September warning her that she could face legal ramifications if she continued navigating the dispute with “threatening and verbally abusive behavior.” Weintraub said the two boys have different fathers; one was by his son’s hospital bed on Monday evening and the other had yet to be located. The shocking incident sparked a brief manhunt on Monday afternoon, with police issuing a notice for the community to keep watch for Nguyen, who fled in a white 2018 Toyota Sienna. According to the Courier Times, a nearby church spotted a matching vehicle in their parking lot and called the cops. Police say they found Nguyen under the influence of unspecified drugs at the church around 11:30 a.m. In an email to parents of children at Newtown Middle School, which at least one of the boys attended, Principal Timothy Long said, “We are all greatly saddened by the tragic event that occurred within our school community today. Such tragedy is always difficult to process for all of us, especially for our children.” “I have two kids, and this couldn’t hit any closer to home” Weintraub said at the afternoon press conference. “I’ve kept saying my prayers since I got the call this morning.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

5/4/2022,"The Kremlin escalated its rhetorical dispute with Israel over World War II history on Tuesday morning by reiterating and expanding on the falsehood-riddled comments made by Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, about the supposed collaboration of Jews during the Holocaust with their own Nazi killers. In a post titled “On Antisemitism,” published on the Telegram social media network, Russia’s foreign ministry tried to equate Israel's support for Ukraine with Jews whom it alleged collaborated with Nazis in World War II, arguing (incorrectly) that history “is unfortunately familiar with tragic examples of Jewish-Nazi collaboration.” It went on to accuse the current regime in Kyiv — headed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is Jewish — of precisely such complicity, while insisting to Israel that it was the Red Army “that stopped the Holocaust and the destruction of the Jewish world.” The post went so far as to suggest that Israel, which has not played a prominent role in supporting Ukraine in its war effort, may be too naive to realize that after “canceling” Russians, the Ukrainian leadership will inevitably move against the nation’s Jewish population. It was a remarkable turn of events, considering that when the war began, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett sought to broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. Slow to help at first, Israel offered Ukraine material support late last month. If that support has been more limited than that of European nations and the United States, that is largely because Israel’s precarious geopolitical status leaves it little room to maneuver between allies and foes. Still, it is not entirely clear why the Kremlin has decided to invoke one of the most controversial and misunderstood aspects of World War II history as a means of persuading Israel — and, presumably, other nations — that it was right to invade Ukraine. Such an attempt may have been inevitable, given that Russia’s initial rationale for attacking its much smaller neighbor was a need to “de-Nazify” Ukrainian leadership. Lavrov offered his own thoughts on the matter on Sunday, telling an Italian outlet,“Wise Jewish people say that the most ardent antisemites are usually Jews.” He also repeated the debunked claim that the Nazi dictator, Adolf Hitler, was partly Jewish. Having just commemorated the Holocaust the previous week, Israeli leadership vigorously denounced Lavrov’s remarks. “Foreign Minister Lavrov’s remarks are both an unforgivable and outrageous statement as well as a terrible historical error,” Lavrov’s counterpart, Israeli foreign minister Yair Lapid, wrote on Twitter. “Jews did not murder themselves in the Holocaust. The lowest level of racism against Jews is to accuse Jews themselves of antisemitism.” Despite the fact that there is little evidence that Lavrov’s argument — or any other Russian justification for the Ukraine invasion — has gained any traction, Russia’s foreign ministry decided to post a lengthy exposition on Telegram that called Lapid’s statement “anti-historical” and repeated Lavrov’s claim that European Jews were responsible for their own destruction. The Russian foreign ministry charged Zelensky with “consciously” abetting Ukrainian neo-Nazis, comparing him to Jewish leaders during World War II who may have been aware of some aspects of the Holocaust but who chose to say nothing. Zelensky, on the other hand, is helping neo-Nazis “quite voluntarily,” the Telegram post said. Russia's claims about complicity with the Nazis fail to reflect what the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum calls “impossible moral dilemmas” faced by Jewish leaders in Eastern European ghettos, from which hundreds of thousands of Jews were deported to the death camps of Poland. The Nazis kept secret their plans for the Holocaust, telling Jews that they were merely being “resettled” in Poland. Rumors of the death camps did reach the ghettos, where Jews were housed in inhumane conditions, but many refused to believe them. Even as the Russian foreign ministry proffered its arguments about Jewish-Nazi collaboration, it acknowledged — in the same Telegram post — that any such collaboration on the part of Jewish leaders was, in the words of three leading Israeli historians, a “marginal phenomenon.”",World/Yahoo News,Russia lashes out at Israel as rift over Holocaust and Ukraine widens,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-lashes-out-at-israel-as-rift-over-holocaust-and-ukraine-widens-223208572.html
