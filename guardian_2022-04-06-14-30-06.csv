4/6/2022,"Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories today. Britain, the United States and the western allies are preparing to impose new sanctions on Moscow over civilian killings in Ukraine as the west makes a fresh attempt to cripple Vladimir Putin’s economy and war effort. In a powerful address to the United Nations last night, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy described the atrocities in his country as “war crimes” while the office of Ukraine’s top prosecutor said 4,400 incidents were being investigated. The carnage in Bucha and other towns around Kyiv has caused worldwide revulsion and new measures against Russian banks, officials and a ban on new investment will be unveiled today, coordinated between Washington, G7 economies and the European Union. Russia’s ambassador to the UN repeated the Kremlin’s claims that the violence was due to “the horrific provocation of Ukrainian forces”, but the attention in New York was on Zelenskiy and his “uncomfortable” message for the UN to provide more help. Our correspondent Shaun Walker spent two days in one of the worst-hit towns, Trostianets, where he found “evidence of summary executions, torture and systematic looting”, adding that “it will a take a long time to catalogue all the crimes the Russians committed” in such places. Boris Johnson issued a video appealing to the Russian people to obtain the technology to bypass censorship and “look at what is being done in your name”. It came as Britain said it would work with the US and Australia in developing nuclear-capable hypersonic weapons after Russia used the deadly high-speed missiles in airstrikes last month during the war in Ukraine. Here’s what we know so far on day 42 of the conflict, and here is the blog with the latest developments. Two-child failure – The government’s attempts to tackle the so-called “benefit culture” by limiting welfare payments to the first two children born to the poorest households has failed, according to research. Since its introduction five years ago, the fertility rate for third and subsequent children born to poorer families has barely fallen. Instead, the main impact of the policy has been to become the biggest single driver of child poverty, said Prof Jonathan Portes, co-author of the study. C4 backlash – Boris Johnson will struggle to get his plans to privatise Channel 4 through parliament after a backlash from within his party. The plans to raise £1bn-plus by selling off the state-owned channel has sparked furious opposition from people such as Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Tory leader, and former cabinet ministers Damian Green and Jeremy Hunt. Another opponent, father of the house Peter Bottomley, said it should rejected because it was “bad for the diversity of television, bad for viewers and bad for independent producers”. Sky, ITV, Discovery and Paramount are possible buyers if the plans went ahead. ‘Come clean’ – Ministers are refusing to disclose any pictures taken by official No 10 photographers of illegal gatherings held inside Downing Street, prompting Labour to call on Boris Johnson to “come clean and release these photos”. The Cabinet Office refused to confirm or deny the existence of any photographs of events in the cabinet room, leaving parties, and a party in the prime minister’s Downing Street flat after official pictures of the gatherings were requested under freedom of information laws. Covid risk for over-55s – A rise in Covid infections in the over-55s could see an increased number of hospitalisations and deaths in the coming weeks, experts have warned. Imperial College London’s latest React-1 study found that while infections appeared to be slowing down or plateauing in most younger age groups in England, they were rising in over-55s, with no clear sign of when they will peak. The average prevalence of Covid-19 across England stood at 6.4% – by far the highest since the study began in May 2020. Pop hit – Manchester is to become home to the British Pop Archive, including treasures such as handwritten lyrics by Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis and memorabilia from the city’s rich music history. Its creators hope it will become the national collection for all aspects of postwar popular culture. Also part of the collection will be the archive of Granada TV, shining light on its dazzling roster of programmes including Coronation Street, World in Action and Prime Suspect. From the cancellation of performances of Tchaikovsky to the exit of Ikea and McDonald’s from Moscow, there has been a rush to boycott all things Russian. But what impact do these official and unofficial economic protests have?

Emine Saner talks to specialist investigators, ghost hunt organisers and the man behind an Uncanny podcast. Manchester City were not the smooth operators they so often are but a slender victory against Atlético may prove invaluable when the tie is decided in next week’s return at Wanda Metropolitano. Foden started on the bench but after little more than a minute on the pitch his dribble and pass led to Kevin De Bruyne’s goal. Jürgen Klopp’s public exercise in maintaining Liverpool’s focus held little consolation for Benfica, who went down 3-1 at home. Tiger Woods’s Masters comeback after the life-threatening car crash seemed fanciful but the former world No 1 has defied limits throughout his career. The chair of the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association, Alex Wurz, has put F1 on notice that its drivers will no longer stay silent on issues such as boycotting the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. Leah Williamson has described being named as England’s captain for the European Championship this summer as “the biggest honour in football” and something that will “never sink in”. And it comes as the curator of a new exhibition at London’s Design Museum called for the rich history of women’s football to be taken more seriously. Eleanor Watson, the curator of Football: Designing the Beautiful Game, called for “a concerted effort on all sides” to address the imbalance towards men in football history. The world economy may be on the brink of a new inflationary era where consumers will be faced with persistently higher prices and rising interest rates due to the retreat of globalisation, a leading central bank chief has said. Agustín Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements, said higher rates could be required for several years to combat inflation which is 6.2% in the UK. Asian markets followed the US downwards overnight but FTSE100 futures are pointing to a flat start in London. The pound is $1.307 and €1.199. The Guardian’s main story is “Zelenskiy: Russian leaders must face war crimes trial” and the front also features Shaun Walker’s devastating dispatch from Trostianets. “Stop Putin or dissolve yourself, Zelenskiy tells UN” is the headline in the Telegraph, while the Times has “Britain wants hypersonic missiles to counter Russia” and the Mail goes with Johnson’s video message: “Don’t let Putin do this in your name”. The Mirror features the story of a mother in Ukraine who wrote her daughter’s details on the child’s back in case the family was split up by the Russians. “If I don’t make it … this is who you are”, the splash headline reads. The Sun claims that former Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is feeling the pinch because of sanctions: “Red Rom kicked in roubles”, it says. The i picks up on the growing Tory rebellion over plans to privatise Channel 4 – “Tory rebellion brewing over Channel 4 privatisation” – which is also a big story in the Yorkshire Post because the station has a base in Leeds: “Alarm over plans to sell broadcaster”. The FT leads on market concern as “Fed to make ‘rapid’ cuts to balance sheet next month, says top official”, and the Express claims “2,921 council ‘fat cats’ paid more than £100k”.

4/6/2022,"The Department of Defence will not commit to briefing the opposition on major project decisions that the Morrison government may have made secretly prior to the launch of the election campaign. The stance has led the opposition to claim the government may have already signed off on a series of defence-related decisions “which are banked up but not yet public”, essentially saving them for the campaign period. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is expected to call an election within days. The Coalition is eager to make national security a major theme in its pitch to voters, with Morrison arguing the world faces “uncertain times” and it is not a time for “weakness”. The acting secretary of the Department of Defence, Matt Yannopoulos, agreed at a Senate estimates hearing on Wednesday that defence capability decisions should not be driven by politics. But he relied on a strict reading of caretaker conventions that government decisions could be made before the campaign begins and announced during it without requiring opposition consultation. Yannopoulos said if there was a “a major capability change or the need for a government decision” to be taken during the campaign period itself, “we would brief the opposition in accordance with the caretaker conventions”. But when asked whether the department intended to brief the opposition on decisions already taken, but not yet announced, prior to potential public announcement during caretaker mode, Yannopoulos replied: “No.” Pressed on the reason for not doing so, he added: “Because the government has taken those decisions prior to the caretaker period. We’re not in caretaker yet.” Labor’s Senate leader, Penny Wong, said the public had a right to know if there were “secret capability decisions” that the government was holding off for an election campaign. Yannopoulos said he would “need to seek some advice” from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C) “in terms of the way I’m interpreting the caretaker conventions”, but his understanding was that “we can brief on processes of government”. The caretaker period begins at the time the House of Representatives is dissolved and, by contention, governments avoid making major policy decisions that are likely to commit an incoming government. If such a major policy decision needs to be made during the caretaker period, “the minister would usually consult the opposition spokesperson beforehand”, according to the official guide. But a gap in the conventions is if decisions have already been made prior to the start of the campaign, but are announced during it. “However, where possible, decisions should be announced ahead of dissolution if their announcement is likely to cause controversy, which may distract attention from the substantive issues in the election campaign,” the PM&C guide adds. At Wednesday’s committee hearing, the Labor senator Tim Ayres said the public should brace for the Coalition to make a “set of political announcements” on defence during the campaign. Ayres asked whether a decision on air warfare destroyers had been taken but not yet announced, following a report in The Australian that the Spanish shipbuilding company Navantia was pitching to build three more within a decade. Yannopoulos made clear that Defence had “not prepared any advice on what has been reported in the media today” and he believed it would be “highly unlikely” that the government would announce it without taking advice. “They would need the expertise of our organisation and our capability acquisition expertise. I can’t be clearer than that: we have not done that work, but we are in a unique time in the Australian cycle when there is a lot of speculation,” he said. Asked whether political considerations should drive defence capability decisions, Yannopoulos said: “No.” Later in the hearing, Yannopoulos appeared open to a more general briefing process. Wong suggested it would be reasonable for the shadow defence minister, Brendan O’Connor, to have a pre-election consultation with the department in which officials could be asked about “machinery” and “administrative matters, including the procurement framework”. In response to this broader suggestion, the department secretary replied: “Yes.” The exchange follows an announcement early on Wednesday morning that Australia, the US and the UK would collaborate on hypersonic missile technologies under the Aukus banner. Labor has pledged bipartisan support to the Aukus partnership, under which the US and the UK will also help Australia to acquire at least eight nuclear-propelled submarines. But the first of those submarines are not expected to be ready until the late 2030s. Morrison told reporters on Wednesday cyber was “part of modern warfare” and that was why the government had committed $10bn over 10 years in last year’s budget for the so-called Redspice program. However, it has been revealed that the government has scrapped a $1.3bn program to buy armed drones to partly offset Redspice. Under the now-cancelled SkyGuardian program, Australia had planned to acquire up to 12 armed drones for a range of purposes including surveillance. Vice Adm David Johnston, the vice chief of the Australian defence force, confirmed Australia did not have any armed drones, but argued that type of capability “can be mostly replicated through other means”. Until the cancellation, Johnston said, Defence had been “continuing the development” of the SkyGuardian program and its “expectation” was that it would probably advance to the next stage. But he said the scrapping was “a result of a decision to prioritise a cyber capability and we needed to determine the funding to achieve that”.",News/Australia news,Morrison government accused of keeping defence decisions secret and ‘banked up’ for election campaign,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/06/morrison-government-accused-of-keeping-defence-decisions-secret-and-banked-up-for-election-campaign
4/6/2022,"Ethiopian paramilitaries have carried out a campaign of ethnic cleansing in Tigray, forcing hundreds of thousands of people from their homes using threats, killings and sexual violence, according to a joint report by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. The rights groups accuse officials and paramilitaries from the neighbouring Amhara region of war crimes and crimes against humanity in western Tigray, in northern Ethiopia. “Since November 2020, Amhara officials and security forces have engaged in a relentless campaign of ethnic cleansing to force Tigrayans in western Tigray from their homes,” said Kenneth Roth, director of HRW. According to the report, militias from Amhara joined the Ethiopian armed forces and its allies to seize western Tigray in the first few weeks of the war, using indiscriminate shelling and execution to force people to leave. The report said these forces also put up signs in towns demanding that people leave and made threats to kill civilians who wanted to stay. The report said government forces were complicit in the alleged crimes. “Ethiopian authorities have steadfastly denied the shocking breadth of the crimes that have unfolded and have egregiously failed to address them,” said Roth. The report cited a woman who said she had been raped by soldiers. She said they had told her they were trying to wipe out Tigrayans and were “purifying your blood”. A boundary change that formed the western Tigray zone has been disputed since 1992 by Amharas living in the zone, who said Tigrayan forces had suppressed their identity, including through violence. The report highlights how Tigrayan forces committed war crimes against Amharas during the conflict, including the massacre of Mai Kadra when Tigrayan forces and Tigrayan residents attacked Amharas in the town on 9 November 2020, prompting retaliatory attacks. The UN said more than 200 people were massacred. Over 15 months, researchers from Amnesty and HRW interviewed more than 400 people, including interviews with Tigrayan and Amhara residents, and Tigrayan refugees in Sudan. Researchers also consulted medical and forensic reports, court documents, satellite imagery, and photographic and video evidence. Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general, said the level of abuse of civilians had not been taken seriously enough internationally. “The response of Ethiopia’s international and regional partners has failed to reflect the gravity of the crimes that continue to unfold in western Tigray,” she said. “Concerned governments must help bring an end to the ethnic-cleansing campaign, ensure that Tigrayans are able to safely and voluntarily return home, and make a concerted effort to obtain justice for these heinous crimes.” Amnesty and HRW also accused Amhara forces and officials of denying humanitarian aid to civilians in western Tigray, an issue the UN has raised concerns about in recent months. The UN said road closures meant humanitarian agencies were running low on supplies and fuel, forcing six aid organisations to halt their work in February. Last week the first convoy of aid for 100 days reached Tigray’s capital, Mekelle, after a “humanitarian truce” was announced by the Ethiopian prime minister, Abiy Ahmed.",News/Global development,"Tigray has been the scene of ‘ethnic cleansing’, say human rights groups",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/06/tigray-has-been-the-scene-of-ethnic-cleansing-say-human-rights-groups
4/6/2022,"Crab and lobster have been classed as “fish to avoid” by the Marine Conservation Society in its new UK guide to sustainable seafood, due to concern over whales getting entangled in Scottish fishing gear. Monkfish from the North Sea and the west of Scotland, where populations have declined to their lowest since 2013, have also joined the guide’s list of “fish to avoid”, alongside most skates and rays. Skates and rays are in decline globally, with a third of species facing extinction due to overfishing. The charity said its latest assessment of UK seafood shows a need for more rigorous management of British seas, as well as revealing a glaring data gap of fish and seafood stocks in Scottish waters. Fourteen species of fish and seafood have joined the MCS’s “fish to avoid” list. Ten were added last year. The MCS said the picture was concerning as it “was moving in the wrong direction”. “The latest Good Fish Guide ratings – where all new UK ratings are either amber or red rated – illustrate the urgent need for transparency and better management if we’re to recover fish stocks in UK seas,” said Clara Johnston, fisheries policy manager at the MCS. Crab and lobster populations are suffering as a result of poor management generally. In the west of Scotland, however, there is particular concern that migrating whales are getting entangled in ropes attached to crab and lobster pots more frequently. A study last year by Nature Scotland found increasing entanglements of cetaceans, sharks and turtles in crab and lobster creels. Reported entanglements were most likely to be minke whales or basking sharks, but 95% of entanglements went unreported, the study said. The waters around Skye were the riskiest for interactions between creels fleets and whales. Charlotte Coombes, MCS’s good fish guide manager, explained: “The migrating whales are funnelled between the mainland and the islands. Some of the evidence suggest the minke whales are not as strong swimmers as humpbacks, so minkes are more affected.” Recent data suggest that 2.2% of the local minke population may be killed through entanglement each year. Except for in Shetland, there are no limits to the number of pots that fishers can put in the water in Scotland. The decline in monkfish in the North Sea and the west of Scotland is also worrying, added Coombes. “There are catch limits and that does help. But the limits apply to a wider area, so there is room for the population to be taken at higher quantities than it can sustain.” Nine types of Scottish brown crab and lobster were classified differently in this year’s guide: eight were either “fish to avoid” (or amber, under the MCS’s traffic light system), while only one, Shetland brown crab, was rated as “best choice” (a green traffic light). There was some good news: 10 types of fish and shellfish were now in the “best choice” category, including sardines from off south-west England and North Sea herring. There are 656 species ratings in all, with 161 now listed as “avoid” and 148 as “best choice”. The Future Fisheries Alliance, a coalition between the MCS, WWF and the RSPB, is calling for fisheries management to be to strengthened. It wants to see the current draft of the Joint Fisheries Statement, due to be published at the end of the year, include targets for recovery of depleted fish populations via more effective management, a commitment to install remote electronic monitoring on vessels and urgent action to tackle wildlife bycatch. Monkfish from the North Sea and west of Scotland. Numbers have declined from a peak in 2017 to the lowest since 2013 (below the average for the last 16 years). Management is poor and fishing pressure is too high. If you are desperate for monkfish, those caught in the Celtic Sea remain amber-rated as an “OK choice”. Celtic Sea cod. Cod, whiting and haddock fished here are caught together because they swim and feed together. However, Celtic cod and whiting populations are at dangerously low levels, affecting reproduction rates as a result. Scientists recommend that cod should not be caught at all in this area. Most brown crab and lobster. New ratings for Scottish brown crab and lobster have been added to the Good Fish Guide this year. Eight of the nine new ratings are either rated as amber, or fish to avoid. Shetland brown crab is the only “best choice”, green-rated option in the UK.Crab and lobster populations are suffering as a result of poor management, and in some areas, there are concerns of entanglement of whales in the ropes attached to pots. There is hope that if the fishing method is improved, it could become sustainable because it makes little difference to the seabed. Mackerel. Stocks have stayed high, so the green rating remains for this. Scampi and langoustine. These are ranked amber if trawled, but green if pot-caught. North Sea herring. Green again, because the steep decline in population observed since 2017 has slowed down, and an updated stock assessment shows better numbers than previously thought. Sardines from the southern Celtic Sea and Channel. These have been moved from amber to green. King and queen scallops from the Isle of Man. Showing improvements thanks to good management. Queen scallops have been moved off the red list and are now rated amber.

4/6/2022,"It was clear during the first season of Bridgerton – which reigned over prime pandemic Netflix last year – that creator Shonda Rhimes was taking full creative liberty over Regency-era dramas. There were acoustic Ariana Grande covers, a Black queen of England, and other perfect anachronisms to accompany a love story so lusty, its sex scenes were analysed and deconstructed in national media for weeks after its debut. The second season, meanwhile, presents a new family to simultaneously scrutinise and stan: the Sharmas. The chaotic, beautiful and historically/culturally inaccurate telling of this Indian family in the early 19th century is the exact spin that I needed in a series that so brutally decided that keeping Daphne and not Regé-Jean Page’s Duke around was morally acceptable. The Sharmas – Mary and her daughters, Kate (Simone Ashley) and Edwina (Charithra Chandran) – enter the screen as British nobility who are outsiders to society. Mary (of some sort of vague Indian heritage) married an Indian clerk beneath her family’s station and moved with him to India, away from her parents’ malignant gaze. Kate is the clerk’s daughter from a previous relationship. But after his death, the three women come back to London with their hopes hinged on Edwina, the youngest, finding a rich English suitor. What ensues is the dramatic lovechild of Jane Austen and Karan Johar. There are stolen glances, forbidden affairs, gold-digging men and women, some on-brand steamy scenes and many hidden secrets. But the most delightful part to me was how Rhimes and her scriptwriters have played with this often fraught idea of representation. For any person-in-the-know it is clear that the Sharma family does not fit neatly into a south Asian/Indian formula. Their last name is upper-caste north Indian, but Kate and Edwina call their father Appa, the Tamil name. There is a pre-wedding haldi ceremony. The family speaks Marathi and Hindustani, which could align with their Bombay upbringing, but Kate calls Edwina “bon”, a Bengali word for sister, which she pronounces like “bon-bon”. Kate disdains English tea, opting instead for some version of chai, which she makes with pour-over hot water. In short: the whole thing is a pan-Indian cluster that is delightfully and wonderfully nonsensical. I believe firmly that this was on purpose. It would take one Google to know that some of these decisions don’t necessarily make sense. But instead of attempting to force authenticity into a plotline and world that requires suspended imagination in the first place, we get to enjoy mainstream diversity and frivolity at the same time. We are offered a romantic, sugar-coated world through the eyes of Lady Whistledown, while still having moments of connection – Kate’s desire to move back to Bombay, for example, forever one of the best cities in the world. I’ll admit that in the past I’ve been a purist. Years of growing up around few people that looked like me – or being harassed in post-9/11 Florida – have made me cringe when the first south Asians trickling on screen were pigeonholed or whitewashed, or simply seemed off. But at this stage of reckoning with big-I identity and big-R representation, this is a sign of something new. Something that doesn’t require pandering or assuaging a monolithic community that doesn’t actually exist, except to white people. Instead it’s beautiful brown women on a screen, acting out a fantasy which dabbles ever so lightly in feminism, antiracism and classism. That doesn’t, of course, mean that colorism and racism don’t exist. In interviews, the actors playing Kate and Edwina have expressed pride in what they’ve brought to the series as well as the racist harassment received on social media. The latest Teen Vogue cover star, Chandran talks about being derided for her “dark” skin, even in her own family. And Ashley said she attempts to take both “culturally specific roles and non-culturally specific roles” to avoid being typecast in the industry. To that end, the Sharma family embodies a little bit of both. In doing so, it allows for a much greater spectrum of both frustration and delight for the brown audience. And that fits for a show that acknowledges one of life’s most constant truths: kabhi khushi, kabhie gham.",Arts/Television & radio,Bridgerton’s South Asian representation is wonderfully anachronistic | Ankita Rao,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/06/bridgerton-south-asian-representation-is-wonderfully-anachronistic
4/6/2022,"The rich history of women’s football needs to be taken more seriously so future generations of fans can learn about its heritage, the curator of a new exhibition at London’s Design Museum has said. Eleanor Watson, the curator of Football: Designing the Beautiful Game, called for “a concerted effort on all sides” to address the historical imbalance in football history, which is hugely tipped in favour of men. “It has to come from a genuine desire to change things, not to just have something tokenistic, such as: in every Top 10 [players] list we have to include something about one woman,” she said. Watson said an effort needed to be made to engage with British players from the 1970s, some of whom have not been interviewed, about their experiences. “It’s taking the time to approach some of these players from different eras to uncover their stories. They competed internationally and they’re still alive – it is an opportunity that still remains open,” she added. During her research for the show, Watson stumbled upon images from the 1971 Women’s World Cup, which was held in Mexico and featured the British Independent Ladies, the unofficial British women’s team. Despite the tournament being a success, Watson describes the “crazy moment for the team who played at the Aztec Stadium in front of 100,000 people and then came home to the UK and no one greeted them at the airport. No one. None of it had been covered.” The plan for the exhibition was to have 50/50 male and female representation, but the Football Association’s 50-year ban on women playing football, which started in the UK in 1921 and lasted until the 70s, made that impossible. “The answer isn’t obviously just one exhibition,” she added. “The reality is that there’s so many other things that need to happen before we reach that 50/50 representation.” The exhibition, which took two years to assemble and includes loaned items from the National Football Museum in Manchester, is a sprawling look at the impact design has had on football and vice versa. Items include a woman’s football kit from 1895, Nike’s first boot designed specifically for women, as well as banners made by Liverpool fan and “craftivist” Peter Carney and a pair of George Best’s boots that he wrote on to keep track of his goal record. There is also a section on stadium design, including the Zaha Hadid “eco-stadium” for Forest Green Rovers and the Estádio Municipal de Braga in Portugal, which is carved into the side of a cliff and won the Pritzker Architecture Prize. As well as high-end design and boots by huge manufacturers such as Adidas, there are fan-crafted items including a two-volume collage scrapbook dedicated to the Preston North End player Sir Tom Finney. “They’re absolutely incredible because this person has gone through collecting reams and reams of articles about him and cut out all of these pictures of him and then painted in his shirt – they’re like bonkers collages,” Watson added. The exhibition comes at a time when the women’s game is more popular than ever. In March, 91,553 people came to the Camp Nou to witness Barcelona beat Real Madrid – the biggest ever attendance for a women’s football match. The BBC is showing Women’s Super League games on terrestrial television, while the upcoming Euro 2022 championship is expected to break more attendance records.",Sport/Football,Curator of football exhibition says women must be represented,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/06/curator-of-football-exhibition-says-women-must-be-represented
4/6/2022,"In Charles Daniels’ modest home in Somerville, Massachusetts, on the outskirts of Boston, lie tens of thousands of undeveloped photos, sitting in molting canisters scrawled with cryptic markings and decaying instructions. Most have been sitting there for over five decades, and while Daniels can’t be sure of everything that’s hidden in his trove, he knows for sure that much of it chronicles a pivotal moment in pop culture – when rock acts as impactful as the Who, the Faces, and Jimi Hendrix made their first mark in America. As a young man in the 1960s, Daniels took pictures obsessively, shooting whatever caught his eye, wherever it wandered. By 1967, he had an enviable vantage point for that obsession, courtesy of the great amount of time he spent hanging out, and working as emcee, at the Boston Tea Party, a key venue in the psychedelic rock revolution. Despite his proximity to history, however, Daniels never took his bounty seriously. “Most of what I shot, I just forgot about,” he said during a Zoom interview from his home. “We took a lot of things for granted at that time.” In fact, it wasn’t until the isolation caused by the Covid lockdown that Daniels’ longtime companion, Susan Berstler, finally prodded him to begin the daunting task of having his work developed. The relatively small number of shots that have been developed so far demonstrate Daniels’ rare perspective on the stars of the day. “We all hung out together,” he said. “So I had an intimacy with the bands no one else had.” It shows in the rough-hewn character of the photographs. Unlike the carefully lit, finely composed work of rock photographers such as Annie Leibovitz, Henry Diltz or Jim Marshall, Daniels’ shots are more like the fly-on-the-wall snaps you’d get from a friend. As a result, they capture something more casual, close and real. “What’s unique about Charlie’s photos is that they show you what life was really like for a band on the road at that time,” said Steve Nelson, who booked and managed the Boston Tea Party during its peak. “Because he was a part of the crew, his pictures present the bands in a new light.” The Tea Party was the perfect place to catch it. According to Peter Wolf, vocalist of the Boston-based J Geils Band, “the British groups would come to the Boston Tea Party to get their stuff together before they went down to Hartford, then to New Haven and then to New York, where the media was waiting for them. It was a testing ground.” “It’s a shame the Tea Party never gets mentioned in the same breath as the Fillmores in San Francisco and New York because it was just as important,” said Ryan H Walsh, whose book Astral Weeks: The Secret History of 1968 centers on the Boston music scene of the time. “It was essential.” How Daniels himself became an essential part of the scene reflects the attitudes of the era. The club never officially hired him as its emcee. He just naturally evolved into the role. “I was someone who was there every weekend on the scene,” Daniels said. “I knew the music. So when they felt they needed a little intro for the bands, as opposed to them just starting to play, it became easy enough for me to become the announcer.” He first did so for Wolf’s pre-J Geils band, the Hallucinations, in 1968. “I met Charlie hanging out in Harvard Square, which was a cultural mecca,” said Wolf. “We would see each other at various shows and we became really tight.” So much so that Wolf started to use Daniels as his foil on a radio show he hosted on Boston’s prime underground rock station, WBCN. Wolf let Daniels host on nights when he couldn’t make it back from a gig on time, and he gave him his nickname: “the Master Blaster”. Still, Daniels’ style as emcee and DJ eschewed the hyped-up tone that moniker implies. “Charlie’s style was very mellow and easy,” Wolf said. “He was welcoming to people, and that’s why I think he developed such a friendly relationship with the bands he photographed.” For Berstler, Daniels’ immersion in Black music may also have played a part. “One of the reasons Charles made such an instantaneous connection with a lot of the British rockers was their love of Black music,” said Berstler. “For those guys, this music was something new. For Charles, it was something he grew up around.” She thinks the fact that he wasn’t looking to publish his photos boosted his rapport with the musicians. As Daniels said: “This was just something I was doing for myself.” Small wonder Berstler considers these pictures to be “Charles’ visual diary. One roll of film we got back made me laugh,” she said. “It was a few shots of whoever was his girlfriend at the time, some pictures of people on the subway and some people walking down Newbury Street and then towards the end of the roll are backstage shots of Pete Townshend and Keith Moon. So, this was less ‘Charles shot the Who’ than ‘this is Charles’ day’.” His approach was so casual, said Wolf, that “some people began to joke that there was no film in his camera. He was taking so many shots that no one saw!” he said. Daniels’ connection to photography began just as purely. Though he was born in segregated Alabama, Daniels grew up in the Boston neighborhood of Roxbury, where he began taking photos at age 12 or 13 after discovering a camera in his parents’ closet. “I just shot what was going on in the neighborhood,” he said. He considered himself a street photographer, much in the manner of Bill Cunningham, who later became well known for shooting whatever fashion caught his eye on the streets of Manhattan. By the late 60s, when the counter-culture became generationally defining, Daniels found both his métier and his milieu. “Things were changing fast,” he said. “When the music started to change, it elevated everything.” He became so interested in the exotic new English musicians who started coming to town, he began to dress like them. “I became as visually interesting as they were,” he said. He formed a special bond with the foppish and hard-partying Ron Wood and Rod Stewart, whom he first met when they were in the Jeff Beck Group. “Jeff was keeping most of the money and not giving Rod and Woody much of a salary so they quit and formed the Faces,” Daniels said. To bolster their effervescent new image, the Faces had a bartender serve them drinks onstage during their shows and they asked Daniels to dance and play tambourine with them. “I became an onstage character,” he said. They even invited him to travel in a Lear jet with them to gigs in other cities. “The rest of their entourage was sent on another plane,” said Berstler. “But Charlie was always on the jet.” During one tour, she said, “Charles got chastised [by the tour manager] because he was spending more money on the road than Rod Stewart!” “To be honest,” Daniels chuckled, “that never slowed me down.” Clearly, Wood didn’t mind because, when he joined the Rolling Stones in 1975, he invited Daniels along simply to keep him company and covered all his expenses. “The roadies had to sleep four to five in a room,” he said. “But I always had my own room.” One person who wasn’t thrilled about Daniels’ presence on the Stones’ tour was Annie Leibovitz, the tour’s official photographer. “She would go out of her way to make sure that I was not getting good photographs,” he said. “She would stand in front of me. But I was always going to get something.” Much as he loved the Stones, his idol was Hendrix, so it was a dream when he was asked to introduce and shoot his show at Boston Garden. “They wanted to know how much to pay me,” Daniels recalled. “I said I would do it for free. But they paid more than anyone else had at the time: $200. I’d love to lay my hands on the film I took from that show.” In the years following classic rock’s peak, Daniels remained a fixture at local shows. He was also hired by a blues and jazz club in Cambridge called Night Stage so that the largely Black artists who played there, including Etta James and Howlin’ Wolf, would feel comfortable in what was an overwhelmingly white environment. Later, Daniels made a humble living shooting dance and fitness videos. Several of his vintage photos were later published in a lavish coffee table book about the Faces and, in the last 20 years, he has twice exhibited his twork local galleries. Over the last two years, Berstler has begun the development process with a local lab, which the couple paid with money from a local arts grant. Realizing the scope of the project, however, a friend set up a GoFundMe campaign with a goal of $40,000. It has raisedmore than $56,000, allowing Daniels to hire Film Rescue International, which specializes in such projects. Even for them, this remains an overwhelming task. With over 3,200 rolls of film – each containing either 12 or 36 shots, at 120mm or 35mm, respectively – that adds up to over 60,000 photos. The project has buoyed Daniels’ spirits during a challenging time. At 79, he is undergoing chemotherapy for a blood disorder. His greatest hope is that the restoration project results in a book, something that never would have occurred to him back in the 60s when he was just living, and shooting, in the moment. “Now I take it a lot more seriously,” he said. “It’s incredible to think that all these things were just sitting there all this time, waiting to come back to life.”",Arts/Art and design,"The photographer with 60,000 undeveloped images of rock history ‘waiting to come back to life’’",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/05/rock-photography-charles-daniels-rolling-stones
4/6/2022,"Of all modernist works of literature, TS Eliot’s The Waste Land is one of the hardest to piece together – as countless disconsolate English students have realised. How to crack the codes of its influences and multiplying footnotes? Are sections of it autobiographical, drawing on the poet’s nervous breakdown and volatile marriage? Why do the poem’s opening lines decree that April, with all its lush promise of spring and renewal, is the “cruellest” of months? Is it genuinely one of the greatest works in the language, or – as the poet once claimed – just “a piece of rhythmical grumbling”? This April, audiences will have an opportunity to consider such questions afresh, perhaps even come up with some answers. To mark The Waste Land’s 100th birthday – it actually first appeared in October 1922, but a little poetic licence seems justified – a six-day festival will take over the City of London, filling 22 churches with responses to Eliot’s poem and its afterlife. The title, fittingly enough, is Fragments. “There are so many different elements to The Waste Land, so many different ways to react,” says co-curator Séan Doran. “It’s kind of a dream work.” Anyone wanting dry textual analysis should look elsewhere: there is not a single straightforward reading of the poem on offer. Instead, Doran and his fellow director Liam Browne have programmed a jamboree of artistic reimaginings, many of them musical, blending – as the poem does – down-and-dirty popular culture with the highest of art. One event features a piano transcription of Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring, which Eliot heard the year before the poem came out and which affected him profoundly. Another is assembled around Messiaen’s Quartet for the End of Time, written in a Nazi prisoner of war camp and likewise shot through with a sense of precarious faith in the bleakest of circumstances. The festival concludes with a tribute to the music hall star Marie Lloyd at Wilton’s, whom Eliot passionately – perhaps incongruously – admired as a “genius” and whose obituary he composed a week before The Waste Land first came out. The festival will be stranded into five, multi-part evening “celebrations” and audiences are encouraged to drift among individual events, sampling, say, a new setting of lines from the poem by the Orkney-born composer Erland Cooper en route to concerts of sea shanties or gospel music. The mezzo-soprano Ruby Philogene will perform songs by Wagner, one of a multitude of artists and writers quoted or alluded to in Eliot’s poem. “There are suggested routes,” Doran explains. “But you can deviate and take in other sites as much as you can. Or just sit for 50 minutes with Gavin Bryars’ Jesus’ Blood Never Failed Me Yet, and slowly sink into it.” Would Eliot approve? He laughs. “I’d hope he would say that we’ve built something real upon the poem. We’ve brought it back into place.” The festival commences with a “secular sermon” delivered by Jeanette Winterson in the ancient nave of Southwark Cathedral, which will explore The Waste Land’s examination of faith and belief. Eliot was a keen student of sermons by 17th-century preachers such as Lancelot Andrewes – buried just metres away from where Winterson will speak – and the poem shows Eliot grappling to find a form for his Christianity, which culminated in his conversion to Anglicanism in 1927 (his friend Virgina Woolf didn’t think he was serious; he absolutely was). The poem probes some of the deepest questions there are, Winterson says: “It’s a slow point in the turning world. It encourages you to take your hand off the panic button and breathe a bit deeper. There’s a real meditative quality to it, if you spend the time.” Having first encountered The Waste Land as a student, Winterson has been refreshing her memory by listening to Alec Guinness’s celebrated mid-70s recording, witty and surprisingly lyrical. “Every time, there would be somewhere deeper to go, somewhere unexpected,” she reflects. “It’s filmic, almost visual. Every time you think you know where you are, it moves to somewhere else.” How is she approaching Eliot’s undoubted antisemitism? “That was real, and I’m not excusing it,” she replies. “But I’m not a fan of cancel culture.” Spread across historic City churches, 15 of them designed by Christopher Wren, the Fragments festival underlines something not always appreciated about The Waste Land: that it’s one of the greatest poems about London ever written. Southwark Cathedral is a stone’s throw from London Bridge, the site of one of the poem’s doomier meditations on mortality (“Under the brown fog of a winter dawn, / A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many, / I had not thought death had undone so many”). As a clerk at Lloyd’s Bank, Eliot worked on King William Street, immediately north of the bridge; he will have walked past the sombre architecture of the St Mary Woolnoth church and heard what the poem calls the “dead sound” of its clock every working day. A later section takes us inside what sounds like a Cockney pub at closing time (“Goonight Bill. Goonight Lou. Goonight May. Goonight …”), while one of its most evocative sequences whisks the reader eastwards along the Strand, towards a dive bar on Lower Thames Street where the mandolin plays and “where fishmen lounge at noon”. “We’ve tried to make it site-specific,” says Doran. “There’s so much in the poem about place, London most of all.” Some of these varied sights and sounds will be refracted in a new acoustic piece devised by the French sound artist and composer Pierre-Yves Macé and installed in St Mary-Le-Bow on Cheapside. Played on a loop, it will sample a babel of voices and characters drawn from the text to create a kind of sound world for this noisiest of poems. Known for pieces that blend concrete sounds and musical textures, Macé was drawn to the polyphonic texture of Eliot’s writing, which – as well as snippets he heard on London’s streets and drinking holes – draws deep on a spread of European influences, from Apollinaire and Baudelaire to Dante and Wagner. “Little by little, we had a cast of 10 voices, among them French, Italian and German native speakers,” Macé explains. “Then I made music out of the spoken words.” Though The Waste Land is regarded as a keystone of English literature, it’s far more than that, he goes on. “The poem is completely European, in my view.” Not just European, says the British-Indian pianist Rekesh Chauhan, who will perform one of the festival’s closing events. Inspired by the poem’s very last words, “Shantih shantih shantih” – a Sanskrit phrase taken from ancient Hindu scripture, translated by Eliot as “The Peace which passeth understanding” – Chauhan will draw on classical Indian ragas to offer a meditation on calm and rest. Eliot studied Sanskrit and was fascinated by the connections between different belief systems; Chauhan argues that despite its anxiety and turbulence, the poem shows a sense of life beyond. “The Waste Land is dark, but there’s also a lot about regeneration, renewal, spring,” he says. “I really hope that will come out.” Perhaps this is a lesson to draw from The Waste Land, a century on: created in the shadow of world war and a devastating global pandemic, it asks whether fragments of the old order can ever be reassembled or whether, to move on, we need to start again. Those themes have boomeranged back in 2022, somewhat uncannily, Doran observes. “A hundred years on, here we are again: Covid, world war, the sense of the fragility of life, even climate change. The poem couldn’t be more relevant to now.” But above that, he argues, it offers a way to navigate a world where so much is nervous and uncertain. “All you need to do is listen to its strength and its spirituality. It’s all there, waiting.”  Fragments: The Waste Land 2022 is at various City of London churches, from 7-12 April.",Arts/Books,‘It takes your hand off the panic button’: TS Eliot’s The Waste Land 100 years on,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/06/it-takes-your-hand-off-the-panic-button-ts-eliots-the-waste-land-100-years-on
4/6/2022,"It was one of the Conservatives’ most controversial cuts: waging war on the UK’s “benefit culture” by restricting social security payments that supposedly enabled “welfare scroungers” to have large families they could ill-afford. The two-child policy – which limits benefits payments to the first two children born to the poorest households – would, proponents argued, cut the welfare bill and bring “feckless” parents to heel by – as one minister put it – teaching them “the reality that children cost money.” New research, however, indicates the behavioural change aspect of the policy has dismally failed. Since its introduction exactly five years ago today, the fertility rate for third and subsequent children born to poorer families has barely fallen. Instead, the main impact of the policy has been to become the biggest single driver of child poverty. “In the absence of a behavioural fertility response to the policy, the main function of the two-child limit is to deprive families living on a low income of approximately £3,000 a year. This will inevitably lead to dramatic increases in child poverty among larger families,” said Prof Jonathan Portes, co-author of the study. Analysis of birth records and household survey data for the study, commissioned by the Nuffield Foundation, found the policy’s introduction in 2017 led to a decline in births of third children of just 5,600 a year – fewer than 1% of the total annual births in England and Wales. The study speculates as to why the policy has had so little behavioural impact. Unpublished research suggests over half of families were unaware of the policy before they were affected. Many large families – Orthodox Jewish and Muslim families are disproportionately affected – may ignore it for religious reasons. The research comes as fresh estimates suggest that 1.4 million children in more than 400,000 families in the UK are affected by the two-child policy. April’s below-inflation benefits rise means affected families with three children face a £983 a month shortfall in benefits, with larger families facing an even bigger hole in their income. Sara Ogilvie of Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG), which produced the estimates, said: “The two-child limit is a brutal policy that punishes children simply for having brothers and sisters. It forces families to survive on less than they need, and with soaring living costs the hardship and hunger these families face will only intensify.” Over 50% of children in families with more than two children will be in poverty by 2027, according to CPAG. Removing the policy would immediately lift 250,000 children out of poverty. Despite ministers’ “feckless claimants” rhetoric, official figures show over half of families affected are working. The two-child policy was the brainchild of the former chancellor George Osborne, who announced it in 2015 against a backdrop of rightwing media hysteria around large families – “benefits broods” claimed to be having children primarily to exploit what was considered to be an over-generous welfare system. It immediately ran into problems after critics pointed out that women who gave birth to a third or subsequent child as a result of rape would be penalised under the policy. Exemptions were introduced for this and for instances of multiple births, or where families had adopted children or had kinship care arrangements. There is evidence the two-child policy has been a key factor in many women’s decisions to have an abortion. Research has suggested it has had a devastating impact on family life, even before the current cost of living crisis, with households forced to cut back on food and heating. It was recently savaged by Tory former welfare reform minister Lord Freud, who called it “vicious” and an “excrescence” and said it should be scrapped. He claimed the policy was forced on a reluctant Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) by the Treasury as the price of introducing universal credit. A DWP spokesperson said: “Universal credit enables people to support themselves and their families while building towards financial independence through work, and the latest figures show that there were 200,000 fewer children in absolute poverty after housing costs compared to 2019/20. “This policy means families on benefits are asked to make the same financial decisions as families supporting themselves solely through work, including considering our comprehensive childcare offer for working parents and child benefit for all children.”",News/Society,"Two-child policy hasn’t made families smaller, only poorer, finds report",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/06/two-child-policy-hasnt-made-families-smaller-only-poorer-finds-report
4/6/2022,"A new report analyzing thousands of direct messages sent to high profile women on Instagram has uncovered what researchers describe as “systemic” failures to protect women in the public eye from “misogynist harassment”. The report, released by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), analyzed thousands of messages sent to five well known Instagram users: including actor Amber Heard, UK television presenter Rachel Riley, activist Jamie Klingler, journalist Bryony Gordon, and magazine founder Sharan Dhaliwal. Researchers examined a cache of 8,717 messages from the women who participated and say they uncovered a wave of misogynistic abuse, pointing to various ways in which Instagram, owned by Meta, has been “negligent” in addressing the issues. Concerns include the fact that users are unable to report abusive voice notes sent directly to them, that users cannot report messages sent in “vanish mode” – when an image is shown just briefly before disappearing – without viewing them, and that users struggle to download evidence of abusive messages. Instagram also allows strangers to place voice calls to women they don’t know over direct message. “There is an epidemic of misogynist abuse taking place in women’s DMs,” said Imran Ahmed, CCDH chief executive director. “Meta and Instagram must put the rights of women before profit.” The messages analyzed in the study were obtained via the Instagram’s data download feature, which allows users to access a record of messages sent by strangers requesting to send them a direct message. However, in some cases participants who had previously blocked abusive users could not access the full “requests” dataset. Thus, only Rachel Riley, Jamie Klingler, and Sharan Dhaliwal were able to see a full analysis of their direct message history. CCDH said such difficulties in accessing data are not limited to the study’s participants and mark a broader problem in the quest to address widespread harassment online. Heard, who received “error” messages when trying to download her own data, said Instagram’s reporting function is “not user friendly, not intuitive, not common sense based.” Although the study surveyed the DMs of just a handful of high profile users, researchers say the findings underscore a wider reality for women on the platform, where death threats, harassment, and unsolicited nude videos and images are sent without recourse. Cindy Southworth, Meta’s head of women’s safety, said that while the company disagrees with “many of the CCDH’s conclusions” that it does agree “the harassment of women is unacceptable”. “That’s why we don’t allow gender-based hate or any threat of sexual violence, and last year we announced stronger protections for female public figures,” she said. Southworth highlighted measures including a separate request inbox for messages from unknown senders and tools to filter messages with common abusive words and phrases. Despite those measures, the CCDH study chronicled dozens of examples of users sending women pornography, nude images of themselves, and pornography edited to feature other faces, known as “deep fakes”, without consent. Aside from the “image-based” sexual abuse, women also received countless violent messages and more specific death threats. Heard said she frequently receives messages imploring her to kill herself, or threatening her baby – to the extent that she no longer feels safe reading any of her messages. Instagram’s community guidelines bans violence and attacks on anyone “based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases”. Such messages are supposed to be taken down immediately, but the CCDH study found this often was not the case. The study showed one in every 15 of the thousands of DMs analyzed violated such rules. It also showed that Instagram failed to act on nine in 10 accounts sending violent threats over DM. It is possible that a larger volume of abuse against famous women goes unaddressed, as Instagram’s guidelines do note the platform does “generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large public audience”. But for many users, harassment on Instagram can have a chilling effect. In 2020, the largest ever global survey on online violence found that one in five girls (19%) have left or significantly reduced use of a social media platform after being harassed, while another one in 10 (12%) have changed the way they express themselves. Several women in the study said they no longer feel safe using Instagram. That aversion can have a particularly detrimental effect on the many women who rely on the platform to make a living, including financial and professional connections and sponsorships. “Digital spaces provide increasingly important ways to maintain relationships, communicate and build personal brands,” Ahmed said. “For women, however, the cost of admission to social media is misogynist abuse and threats sent by abusers with impunity.” Meta platform has in the past taken steps toward removing the accounts of users who send abusing messages. In February 2021 it began to allow users to block abusive accounts from sending further messages for a set period, disabling accounts that repeatedly send abusive DMs, and disabling new accounts created to get around the above measures. But the study’s participants say this is not enough. Gordon, who has been open about her struggles with eating disorders, said she gets ceaseless abusive messages about her weight. “When we look back on this period of our completely unboundaried use of social media we’ll look back with the same horror as we do adverts with the Marlboro man saying smoking is good for you,” she said.",News/Technology,"High-profile women on Instagram face ‘epidemic of misogynist abuse’, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/05/high-profile-women-on-instagram-face-epidemic-of-misogynist-abuse-study-finds
4/6/2022,"It was the middle of the night in April 2020, and everything was “perfectly quiet”, says Mandy Dean. She lives alone in a two-bedroom flat in the north of England and doesn’t tend to go to sleep until around 2am. She was in bed, reading, when suddenly it sounded as if a heavy weight had been dropped on the bedside cabinet beside her. “I jumped out of bed, legged it out of the bedroom, and slept in the living room with the light on,” says Dean. “This happened three nights in a row, and on the fourth night, it was the same sort of noise, but it wasn’t at the side of the bed – it was in the wall right behind me.” She adds: “I’m going to sound crazy, but I know I’m not.” After those four nights, the noises stopped for a couple of weeks, then started up again. Dean did everything she could to find an explanation. The flat below her was empty, but she asked another neighbour and he couldn’t explain it. She checked the heating, the pipes. “You think: ‘Am I actually hearing it?’ Maybe I’m getting a bit stir-crazy. Because of lockdown, my daughters couldn’t come to see if they heard it as well.” Dean called in a paranormal investigator once home visits were allowed. While they were sitting in the living room having coffee, she says, the investigator felt something “really cold go past his legs. About five or 10 seconds later, we heard this bang over by the TV, like something had been dropped. Both of us looked to where the noise was.” The leaves on a plant nearby were moving, she adds. “We go over, and there’s nothing there. So we try to replicate it.” When they lifted the digital streaming box by the TV and dropped it, “it was pretty much the same sound, but we never saw it move”. The investigator, she says, thinks the activity has something to do with the death of her father from Covid-19, because it started a few days afterwards. Dean isn’t convinced, although she heard similar noises in 2016, several weeks after her mother died. At the time, Dean’s daughter was living with her and also heard the noises; she was so scared, she would sleep with a fan whirring to drown the sounds out. Anecdotally, at least, paranormal experiences proliferated during the pandemic. Caroline McKendrick, of Somerset Paranormal Investigators, believes there has been an increase. “Particularly during lockdown,” she says, “which wasn’t ideal because we couldn’t visit people’s homes.” Prof Christopher French, head of the anomalistic psychology research unit at Goldsmiths, University of London, is not surprised to hear reports of a rise. “There is historical evidence for increased interest in, and reported experiences of, this kind of stuff at times of uncertainty, stress and turmoil.” There is certainly a growing fascination with the paranormal, and other phenomena such as UFOs. TV shows on this theme are booming in popularity, from reality programmes following ghost hunters at work, to dramas and spooky films. Numerous Facebook groups have sprung up with people posting pictures they have taken, convinced ghostly faces can be seen in blurred images; organised ghost hunts are well attended. Last year, the Pentagon released a report on “unexplained aerial phenomena”, and UFO research is being taken more seriously, prompting one expert to predict: “2022 is going to be a seismic year for UFOs.” The podcast Uncanny, documenting eerie and terrifying tales, has been a hit; its host, Danny Robins, also made the successful podcast The Battersea Poltergeist, and his play 2:22 has been well received by critics and West End audiences. “I think culture is reflecting back the horror of our society,” says Robins. “The more extreme and horrific society is – and Lord knows, with Trump, Brexit, coronavirus and Ukraine, it has been about as extreme as it gets within most of our lifetimes – we seek ever more extreme forms of entertainment. I noticed from the audiences of my podcast, people are saying: ‘We want to feel that hit of fear.’” Tim Gibson is a paranormal enthusiast who moderates several online groups, and says there has been “a huge surge in interest”. He started experiencing unexplained activity at the beginning of the pandemic. A marketing consultant, he had recently moved into new business premises when coronavirus hit and ended up working there alone. One of the first things he noticed was a framed print, encased in bubble wrap and propped up against the wall, falling over with no explanation. Since then, Gibson says he has taken more than 1,000 videos showing lights going on and off and things moving. He sends me a recording he took, in which a ghostly moan can be heard. “We’ve come to the conclusion that if we were to give it a title, it would be poltergeist activity,” he says. In one of the rooms, he says: “We caught something that seemed like an unbelievable white glow, and when you slow it down, you can sort of see what looks like a face in there. What on earth it was, we have no idea. My wife has experienced [activity] as well, while she’s been here.” He has had a longstanding interest in the paranormal, and has done investigations in the past, but for this he called in a more experienced investigator to help. Investigators are usually not paid for their work, only being reimbursed for petrol costs. “We won’t say it’s ‘paranormal’, because we don’t have proof,” says Gibson. “The paranormal would suggest there’s an afterlife, and nobody’s got any conclusive proof of that as yet.” But he believes in the paranormal? “Absolutely. This is what keeps, I think, all investigators going. We’ve had our own experiences, which is generally what starts our interest. It’s from there: you go looking for irrefutable proof of an afterlife of some sort.” There is a paradox to ghost stories, Robins points out, “that is simultaneously frightening and comforting. The fear is exhilarating, but – at a time when we feel intense existentialist anxiety – it’s like a buffer zone between us and death, that idea that there might be something more out there.” Robins has had “hundreds and hundreds” of people contacting him with their stories recently, although this is more likely to be as a result of the success of his podcasts than an overall increase in experiences. Hauntings, he thinks, “often come from a growing feeling of uneasiness in your surroundings” and clearly the pandemic has caused this for many. In the past couple of years, we have spent more time in our homes, but the pandemic just accelerated the trend towards isolation. “For a long time, we’ve been living more solitary lives, linked by computers and not real-life encounters,” says Robins. If you feel trapped inside, he says, “to the point where the familiar starts to feel claustrophobic, your mind starts to go to other places. A sceptic would argue that the more time we spend in our houses, the more likely we are to be haunted by them.” There are other aspects swirling around. “The interest in the supernatural, post-first world war, definitely came from a breakdown of organised religion, and simply not being able to deal with the amount of grief that was pouring out,” says Robins. Religion is even less likely to provide comfort and answers now – in the latest British census, less than half were expected to say they were Christian, a fall from 71.6% 20 years ago, although an increase in other faiths has been predicted. Is a belief in the paranormal also linked to a growing disregard of science and “experts”? Does the rise of conspiracy theories run alongside the rise in paranormal interest? “I think there is an overlap between some of the people who are seeking answers through the more populist forms of politics and some elements of ghost belief,” says Robins. “You’re seeing that sweeping kind of idea of ‘We want to believe’, and conspiracy theories are about that. I guess it’s simple answers to complicated questions.” Robins points out that the stories he receives “cover the entire spectrum of society. These are rational, sane people having very strange experiences.” One of the most compelling cases on Uncanny was that of Ken – now a scientist – who described a haunting at his university (giving rise to the series’ catchphrase: “Bloody hell, Ken”). “The last few years have been the most stressful that many people can remember,” says French (Uncanny listeners will recognise the professor as one of Robins’s contributors). Stress can interfere with sleep and “sleep deprivation can cause a greater propensity to hallucinate”, he says. “One of our main topics of research is a phenomenon called sleep paralysis.” This is where someone “wakes” but cannot move, and it can be terrifying – people may experience hallucinations, and some have described seeing ghostlike or demonic figures. “If you’ve got susceptibility, it’s more likely to manifest if your sleep pattern is disrupted,” says French. “If you are one of those people, and it’s not a particularly rare phenomenon, you’re more likely to have an attack if you’re going through a very stressed period. About one in 12 people will have at least one episode of sleep paralysis some time in their lives.” There are other, more mundane reasons that people may have experiences they believe are paranormal. Working from home, perhaps on streets that are quieter than usual, they may notice things they haven’t before. “Your house might make funny noises where it’s settling in the heat of the sun or as the heating clicks in and clicks out, that you might not have been aware of,” says McKendrick. “People have become heightened and aware of their surroundings, being at home 24/7.” (She also believes, though, that under psychological stress and with negative thoughts, people can manifest poltergeist-like activity.) There are other reasons for some of the calls investigators receive, caused by the crisis in mental health funding and under-resourced care. Hazel Williams, a paranormal investigator with the London-based group Spectrum Paranormal, says she often gets calls from people suffering from mental illnesses involving psychosis, who believe the voices they are hearing are ghosts. Cheshire-based Tony Hayes, of Paranormal Investigation UK, says the same. “I’ve spent more time on phone calls to mental health services, and the police on occasion, when an individual is clearly unwell, and there is a safeguarding issue,” he says. Another reason that interest in the paranormal has been growing, says Williams, is the increased use of technology, and people posting their own “paranormal” content on social media. “I’ve never known a time when there’s been this abundance of paranormal content everywhere,” she says. More people’s homes are fitted with video-recording devices – such as baby monitors, or home security – and just about everyone has a cameraphone. Almost every case can be explained, she says. “It’s actually quite normal for cameras to pick up dust particles,” she says, which can look like glowing orbs on recordings. “Because of the way the media portrays orbs on TV as spirit energies and ghosts, people tend to jump the gun.” Hayes noticed that after the US paranormal series Ghost Adventures went on air, he would get a surge of calls the following morning – previously, they had been spread out over the week – and the things people complained about were often things that had been on the show. “Over the last four or five series, they’ve moved into darker phenomena, chasing demons, and the calls fit in with that,” says Hayes. “Generally, demonic reports would be probably one every couple of years and we’re suddenly getting dozens of the things.” We make, says French, the most incredible – and unproven – conclusions to explain unexplained phenomena. In the case of UFO sightings, he says, “we very quickly go from something that we don’t know what it is up in the sky to ET, and it’s a huge inferential leap”. When UFO “flaps” – numerous reported sightings – first started to occur in the late 40s and early 50s, people didn’t make the same immediate connection. “If you look at the opinion poll data from that era, the notion that this was something extraterrestrial was hardly part of public consciousness at all,” says French. On sighting something unusual in the sky, “the main worry was that it was Soviets testing secret military technology. This was the height of the cold war, and the degree to which people were projecting their fears about Russia.” We don’t like not being able to explain things, he says, and we will often take even the flimsiest evidence. “That applies to everybody – believers, sceptics. It’s confirmation bias. We’re all disposed to ignore any evidence that seems to contradict what we either don’t believe or don’t want to be true, and to not see any problems with the evidence that apparently does support what we want to be true.” Dean doesn’t agree her “haunting” is related to any kind of sleep disorder, because she sometimes hears the strange sounds during the day, although she does accept that her sleep has been disturbed. Sometimes, the noises are frightening, but she has become used to them. “It’s still happening at the moment, but it’s not every night. I’ll have a period where it’s quiet for about seven to 10 days.” The element of doubt is there, she says, “but when you’re in the moment and you’re going through it, and it can’t be explained no matter how many times you try to rationalise it, you have to accept that there’s probably something on the other side.” Some names have been changed",Lifestyle/Life and style,Spooky Britain: how ghosts became a national obsession,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/06/spooky-britain-how-ghosts-became-a-national-obsession
4/6/2022,"An archive’s fabulous treasures, including a Gutenberg Bible, a Shakespeare first folio and the oldest known fragment of the New Testament, are to be joined by Ian Curtis’s handwritten lyrics for Joy Division’s She’s Lost Control and a wealth of material that shines light on Granada TV. The John Rylands Research Institute and Library in Manchester has announced plans for the British Pop Archive (BPA), which it hopes will become the national collection for all aspects of postwar popular culture. It essentially argues that Weatherfield is as important as Middlemarch and that Curtis should be treated as reverentially as Shakespeare. “Obviously … why wouldn’t you?” said Jon Savage, the recently appointed professor of popular culture at the University of Manchester and one of the driving forces behind the project. “But it is a kind of false equivalence. It’s very easy to look at artefacts from 400 years ago and say that’s really important. What we are saying is this is important now. Maybe if more people had kept material from Shakespeare’s time it wouldn’t just be Shakespeare that we’re talking about.” Pop culture had long been treated with the seriousness it deserved, Savage said. “People really put their heart and soul into it so why wouldn’t you take it seriously?” The collection will include the archive of Rob Gretton, the manager who oversaw the transition of Joy Division into New Order and was a meticulous record-keeper, according to Hannah Barker, the director of the John Rylands institute and a professor of British history. “He kept everything. The archive is enormous, it took up an entire cellar. I never knew Rob, but I’m assuming he kept these things because he knew they were important.” Barker said the idea for a popular culture archive began to form in her head in 2018 after the deaths of Mark E Smith and Pete Shelley. “Because I’m a historian who works in archives, I remember thinking: ‘I wonder what happens if these guys had no archive.’” She met Savage and the project started to take off. She also read a call in the Guardian by Jill Furmanovsky, one of the UK’s most celebrated music photographers, for a dedicated British rock photography archive. “You know when you feel like the universe is whispering to you,” said Barker. Many discussions have been taking place, including with the photographer Kevin Cummins who also has a pair of Hacienda trainers, boxed and unworn in his archive. “I know,” Barker said. “Imagine what a Chorlton dad would do with those.” Also part of the collection will be the archive of Granada TV, shining light on its dazzling roster of programmes including Coronation Street, World in Action, Prime Suspect and, for people who could only dream about going out, The Hitman and Her. Savage said there were a lot of pop and youth culture holdings across the UK, but he believed this would be the first specifically designated pop culture archive. “The reason is obvious really, pop culture has been incredibly fertile in these islands in the post-war period.” Manchester, with its rich popular culture history, is the obvious home for the collection, say its supporters, and it will launch on 19 May with a Manchester-flavoured exhibition of stand-out objects. The intention though is for it to be a national collection and lots of discussions were going on about acquiring archives, said Barker, who wants to challenge “the default assumption that things should go to London, that a national collection should be based in London”. I’d like to question that,” she said. “There’s a lot going on under the surface, there are lots of conversations and negotiations. We’ve got big ambitions.”",News/UK news,From Shakespeare to Ian Curtis: British pop archive to open in Manchester,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/06/from-shakespeare-to-ian-curtis-british-pop-archive-to-open-in-manchester
4/6/2022,"The way in which Britain is powered and heated could be dramatically reshaped by the government’s energy strategy, set to be published this week. Against the backdrop of Russia’s brutality in Ukraine, the landmark policy proposals have been rendered all the more poignant. On top of targeting net zero carbon emissions and wrestling with sky-high energy bills, the UK is also looking to reduce its exposure to Kremlin-controlled oil and gas supplies. With the stakes so high, various industries and political factions are pushing their own special interests in the hope of steering the government – and billions of pounds of taxpayer-backed funding – in the “right” direction. The cabinet is split, with the Treasury sceptical about the funding required for a huge expansion of the UK’s nuclear fleet and divisions also emerging about whether to roll out more onshore wind turbines. So what might be in store when the long-awaited strategy is finally published? Yes. Boris Johnson and Kwasi Kwarteng, the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) minister, have said they intend to reverse the industry’s long-term decline. Nuclear capacity reached nearly 13GW in the late 1990s – about 25% of electricity demand – but will fall to just 3.6GW by 2024 as reactors are retired. Johnson wants to return to that 25% watermark. National Grid estimates UK peak electricity demand in 2050 will be around 85GW, up from 60GW now, because of factors such as the electrification of vehicles and home heating. That implies required nuclear capacity of about 21 GW, equivalent to between six and seven nuclear power plants. The first step is the 3.2GW Hinkley Point C, due for completion in 2027 unless it is delayed yet again. The life of Sizewell B is likely to be extended until 2050, adding another 1.2GW back into the mix. Sizewell C and Wylfa, on Anglesey – both of which have already been through the early stages of planning – are obvious next steps, adding nearly 6GW. Small nuclear reactors (SMRs), known as mini-nukes, are being developed by both Rolls-Royce and GE Hitachi, in theory adding about another 5GW by 2035. To reach the government’s target, another two or even three sizeable plants could be needed. In 2011, the government identified a further five options. Oldbury in Gloucestershire, Moorside (Sellafield) in Cumbria, Bradwell in Essex, Heysham in Lancashire and Hartlepool, County Durham. The government has already given the green light to a “regulated asset base” funding model via the nuclear financing bill, transferring some of the multi-billion pound risk of major projects to the taxpayer. Now the Treasury needs to give its blessing. Nuclear projects take a long time though. If we want energy security in short order, something swifter is required. Relatively speaking, yes. Offshore wind projects take about four years to build and onshore is even quicker, as well as being cheaper and cleaner. The good news is that offshore wind already has full government backing to increase from 11GW to 40GW. Ministers could go further this week and take the target to 50GW. Onshore wind expansion has potential but is complicated by politics. Capacity is approaching 15GW now and the wind industry wants the government’s blessing to get to 30GW. The big question is how much of that would be in England, amid a cabinet split. Scotland’s high wind speeds and remote locations already make it more attractive. It has 8.6GW of onshore wind and could get to 26GW if proposed projects get the green light. England has just 2.9GW and only a further 0.2GW in the pipeline. That’s due to a 2015 moratorium, introduced when Ukip were an electoral threat and had set their face against windfarms. A block on subsidies was lifted in 2020 but ramping up English onshore wind projects would also require reform of planning laws that were introduced at the time, amounting to a de facto ban. That’s where the politics come in. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, called windfarms an “eyesore” at the weekend and is among a group of MPs hoping to thwart a major rollout in England, with Kwarteng and Michael Gove pushing back. Solar is also in line for significant expansion with Kwarteng keen on a ramp-up from 14GW to as much as 50GW. That, too, could be met with opposition. A proposed new £600m solar farm in eastern England – covering an area eight times bigger than Hyde Park in central London – has been labelled a potential “blight” on the countryside. Not straight away but it is no longer ruled out. In 2019 the government imposed a moratorium on fracking, which pumps water, chemicals and sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release trapped oil and gas. Kwarteng is said to be dead against it, with Boris Johnson only marginally less determined, depending on political expediency. But, amid a growing clamour among climate-sceptic Tory MPs, the government has re-opened the debate. Kwarteng has commissioned a study from the British Geographical Survey into any new fracking techniques suitable for use in the UK, which will consider the impact of tremors, saying on Tuesday: “In light of Putin’s criminal invasion of Ukraine, it is absolutely right that we explore all possible domestic energy sources”. And the fracking firm Cuadrilla was recently given another year before it has to cement over its fracking wells in Lancashire. Watch this space. More or less. Jacob Rees-Mogg said this week that the government wants “every last drop” of North Sea oil. There almost certainly will not be a windfall tax on oil explorers, after Kwarteng said that such a plan, proposed by Labour to pay for discounts on home energy bills “would destroy investment and would add to the uncertainty in oil markets”. The likelihood is that they will be encouraged to keep drilling and maximise production. Shell certainly seems to think so. It had abandoned plans to develop the Cambo oilfield in the North Sea before reversing the decision amid high oil prices. Days later it was granted a two-year extension to the field’s licence. Good question. The important flip side of increasing energy output is to reduce energy demand. In his spring statement, the chancellor announced that homeowners installing energy efficiency materials such as solar panels, heat pumps or insulation would not pay VAT, but he was accused of merely “scratching the surface”. Few people can afford to spend thousands of pounds retro-fitting their homes even without the tax. The Green Homes Grant closed last year, so the government could announce a home energy efficiency scheme to replace it. The Energy and Climate Intelligent Unit (ECIU) thinktank backs more ambitious targets for insulation and replacing gas boilers with electric heat pumps. The annual gas savings from insulation upgrades would reach 18 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2027 for 5m homes, they said, matching the output of proposed new gas fields. The ECIU reckons 1.5m heat pumps could be installed before 2027, giving gas savings of 17TWh a year.",News/Business,What to expect in the UK’s energy strategy to be published this week,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/06/what-to-expect-uk-energy-strategy
4/6/2022,"The Queensland police service has taken “immediate steps” to remove an “inappropriate” image of Adolf Hitler that was mistakenly included in an online domestic violence training module for officers. A QPS spokesperson said the silhouette image depicting the Nazi dictator in a peak cap was “unintentionally used” in a module about coercive control “after searching ‘police officer silhouette’ on design program, Canva”. A total of 8,641 QPS members have completed the training, which was endorsed by several domestic violence organisations, the spokesperson said. Queensland’s police minister, Mark Ryan, told Guardian Australia he was “more than disappointed that this has happened”. “I am advised the QPS has apologised, which is the right thing to do,” he said. “I have made it very clear to the commissioner that the police service must have systems in place to ensure that this cannot happen again.” Queensland police have received sustained criticism of their response to domestic violence victims via a number of high-profile cases.

4/6/2022,"The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has accused the federal government of again treating flood victims differently based on their location, in a renewed stoush over emergency response funding. Perrottet on Monday announced grants of up to $20,000 to help uninsured owners and renters make their homes habitable again, saying NSW was funding the whole package because residents could not wait any longer for federal authorities to act. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Tuesday said he had told the premier that the commonwealth was willing to split costs on “the one-in-500-year flood event”. “Our offer remains that we would meet those one-in-500-year flood costs for those impacted properties,” he said, pointing to promises of $2.1 billion in support for the recovery so far. But in an interview with ABC radio on Wednesday, Perrottet suggested that could rule out some victims of recent flooding. “There seems to be people who were disqualified for that funding from the federal government based on where they live,” he said. “It doesn’t matter if you’ve lost your home in Lismore or you’ve lost your home in Mullumbimby. You’re in the same position and you should receive the same financial assistance.” The federal Coalition was last month widely criticised, including by members of its own parties, for offering additional disaster funding to flood victims in Lismore and not nearby Tweed, Byron and Ballina shires. The government later agreed to extend the extra funding to those communities following an assessment by the National Recovery and Resilience Agency. Perrottet, who has been in the flood-hit northern rivers since he returned from paternity leave on Monday, admitted the ongoing negotiations with federal counterparts over flood recovery grants had been “frustrating”. The premier confirmed he had received an offer of more help from Morrison for one of the programs and he would “work through the details”. “We’ve requested further assistance from from the commonwealth. I just want to make sure that we give it as much support as we can,” he said on Wednesday. Speaking earlier on Wednesday, the federal emergency management minister Bridget McKenzie said the governments had been working together at an “unprecedented” level. She reiterated that her government was willing to support the NSW government’s scheme for uninsured residents. “But the PM has made clear that it’s for the one-in-500-year flood event,” she said. The response to the flooding events will be scrutinised in an independent inquiry due to report later this year. Meanwhile, the SES has issued a severe weather warning for heavy rainfall for people across large parts of the state including in Sydney, the Illawarra and parts of the Hunter on Wednesday.",News/Australia news,"NSW flood victims missing out on federal relief because of where they live, premier says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/06/nsw-flood-victims-missing-out-on-federal-relief-because-of-where-they-live-premier-says
4/6/2022,"Victims of upskirting, grooming and image-based abuse will be entitled to financial compensation under reforms introduced to Victoria’s parliament on Wednesday. The Victims of Crime (Financial Assistance Scheme) Bill 2022 will introduce a new financial assistance scheme the state government says is built around the needs of victims and will minimise trauma. This will replace the Victims of Crime Assistance Tribunal (Vocat). Under the new scheme, victims of crime will no longer have to apply to the tribunal to have their applications for financial compensation determined. They will also no longer be required to face their perpetrators or front a hearing to access compensation. In an Australian first, victims will be given the opportunity to request a “recognition meeting” with a government representative to discuss the harm caused to them. The meetings, carried out by a dedicated official, will address the trauma caused by the crime and include a personal apology on behalf of the state government. Victim recognition statements, which acknowledge the effects of the crime, as well as a plain-language statement explaining the reasons for decisions, will also be made available on request. The bill also removes the current practice of pooling financial assistance for bereaved families. This is intended to reduce trauma and conflict between family members, who will now be able to seek assistance for their individual needs. Other features of the bill include the introduction of financial assistance for victims of crimes that are not currently covered by existing law, including sex offences such as upskirting, grooming and image-based abuse offences. Eligibility has also been expanded to recognise Aboriginal kinship relations, LGBTQ+ “chosen families” and close extended family members, while children exposed to family violence will be considered victims in their own right. The bill will also increase the time limit in which victim-survivors of sexual assault or family violence can make a claim from two years to 10 years and provides an oversight role for the victims of crime commissioner. Several of the changes were recommended by the Victorian Law Reform Commission review conducted after the 2015 royal commission into family violence. The minister for victim support, Natalie Hutchins, said the reforms, which are expected to come into effect in the second half of 2023, represent the most significant change for victims of crime in 50 years. “For many victims, going to a court-based tribunal exacerbates their trauma and far too many victims give up or just do not apply for the help they need. We’re fixing that,” she said. Fiona McCormack, the state’s victims of crime commissioner, welcomed the reform but urged the government to make improvements to Vocat in the interim. “It is important government get these reforms right, but while that happens, many victims will still need to interact with the existing scheme administered by Vocat. I have heard from too many victims of crime that the current system is traumatic,” she said. “Victims are dealing with the real-life consequences of Vocat delay – victims of crime are in dire financial circumstances following victimisation. These issues range from missing out on much needed psychological support because victims can’t afford a psychologist bill to experiencing homelessness.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She said backlogs and delays needed to be immediately addressed and the consideration of a victim’s “character and behaviour” when determining compensation scrapped. A wholesale review of the language and materials used to communicate with applicants, consistent with a trauma-informed and plain English approach, should also be carried out, she said. Justice party MP Stuart Grimley said victims of crime need support throughout the whole criminal justice process and called on the government to provide them with independent legal representation. “Police and prosecutors, they do a great job but essentially they represent the state. They represent the law and what we are hearing is and there’s no one that represents victims,” Grimley said. “They’re not there by choice. We need to be doing all we can to make sure that they’re fully supported and protected through the whole process, not just when it comes to financial restitution.”  If you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault, domestic or family violence, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732 or visit 1800RESPECT.org.au; International helplines can be found via www.befrienders.org.",News/Australia news,Victoria’s overhauled crime compensation scheme to include victims of upskirting and grooming,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/06/victorias-overhauled-compensation-scheme-to-include-victims-of-upskirting-and-grooming
4/6/2022,"East of Bakewell, the Monsal Trail peters out like the frayed end of a rope, and it’s not obvious which of several strands to follow. So I have often paused here, considering my next move, under a field of rough sheep pasture that runs down from Manners Wood. It’s a lumpy patch of ground that seems to resent its current use. You sense it wouldn’t take a long human absence before its patches of scrub reclaimed lost territory. But for now it remains occupied. About to move on, I paused at the unmistakable mewling of a buzzard and looked up. A pair of crows was on its tail, invading its airspace, chasing it off, primaries spread like fingers, before turning again for another pass. It’s a common enough sight, especially at this time of year, with these nesting crows more anxious than usual about threats to their young. Yet while it was dramatic, the dogfight overhead lacked the desperate intensity of a genuine fight for life. Buzzards may take a crow chick, but a goshawk is a far greater threat and will bring out many more crows in a raucous flash mob. This was more a performance, a silent exhibition of flying ability from two smaller birds working together to a common end, and one that wasn’t simply about chasing off an enemy. Conflict in nature is a deep pool, one that is often muddied with our own philosophical preconceptions, from Alfred Tennyson’s “red in tooth and claw” to Peter Kropotkin’s “mutual aid”. The battle these crows were fighting might have had layers of motivation beyond mere survival. Watching this pair, I couldn’t help but wonder if a little jeopardy adds something to a relationship between two crows. The buzzard, growing weary of their games, flicked itself casually on to its back and reached up its talons. The crows put the brakes on, sheared off to either side and left the buzzard to right itself, stretch its wings and swoop away in search of easier pickings. The crows, reunited, slid together into the sanctuary of the trees.
