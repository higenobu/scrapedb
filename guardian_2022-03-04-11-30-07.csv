3/4/2022,"Novak Djokovic’s efforts to compete at the next grand slam on the tennis calendar will be far less complicated than his failed Australian Open bid after the French government announced it would suspend its vaccination pass this month. The decision to end current restrictions on 14 March means the Serb will likely be able to defend his French Open title at Roland Garros, beginning on 22 May. The world No 2, who lost top spot in the ATP rankings last week, was unable to play at the year’s opening grand slam in Melbourne after being deported due to his vaccination status. France had held a similar stance to Australia and required all athletes to be vaccinated if they wanted to play in the country, putting Djokovic’s bid for a third French Open title in doubt. The 34-year-old is not vaccinated and said after his experience in Australia – which included several days in detention – that he would be prepared to sacrifice participation at future tournaments rather than receive a Covid-19 jab. But the announcement from French prime minister, Jean Castex, appears to have cleared the path for Djokovic to put himself in contention for a record-equalling 21st grand slam title, after Rafael Nadal inched ahead of the Serb with victory in Melbourne. “The situation is improving thanks to our collective efforts,” Castex said. “The conditions are met for a new phase of easing of measures. From Monday March 14, we will suspend the application of the vaccination pass wherever it applies.” The easing of restrictions in France could also mean Djokovic, who was replaced by Russia’s Daniil Medvedev as world No 1 earlier this week, plays in next month’s Monte Carlo Masters. He returned to action for the first time this year at last week’s tournament in Dubai, but will miss this month’s Masters tournaments in Indian Wells and Miami as he is unable to enter the US.",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic set for French Open with vaccination restrictions to be eased,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/04/novak-djokovic-set-for-french-open-with-vaccination-restrictions-to-be-eased
3/4/2022,"ABC viewers may have been pleasantly surprised to see retired veterans Philip Williams and Michael “Brisso” Brissenden pop up to lend their considerable expertise to analysis of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Once the ABC’s chief international correspondent, Williams quit in April for a quieter life cultivating grapes. But the 64-year-old had to abandon the vineyard and jump on a train to Ultimo last week when the call for help came from his former ABC colleagues. A charmingly dishevelled Williams spent hours on air on the ABC news channel. As a former Europe correspondent, Williams has the gravitas and authority of someone who was the eyes and ears of ABC viewers on the world stage for decades. And this week Brisso, a former Moscow, Brussels and Washington correspondent who filed his last story for the ABC in June, also stepped into the breach. Europe correspondents Nick Dole and Isabella Higgins, and the Middle East correspondent, Tom Joyner, are on the ground in the conflict and winning plaudits for their live coverage of the unfolding events. If I’m counting correctly this is the 6th time air raid sirens have sounded in Lviv today. Mostly we are given a safety signal within the half hour. But I’ve watched a woman drag her 3 small, children to our hotel shelter at all hours now. Each time you feel her sense of panic And Eric Campbell of Foreign Correspondent and David Lipson travelled to Ukraine for a report from the frontline, aired on Thursday night. Here’s our @ForeignOfficial storyRoad to War: Ukraine on the Eve of Russia's Invasion. https://t.co/1srKJmVPD7 -A privilege to work with such a great team on this. Mat Marsic, Leah Donovan, @ericperipatetic @MJSCarney @JuliKutsenko and more. Their work is dangerous and mentally and physically exhausting. Former ABC correspondents, including Williams and Sally Sara, have spoken of the toll that reporting on conflicts can take on their personal lives. But back in the studio in Ultimo, endless rounds of redundancies and the slow erosion of resources for foreign correspondents has meant there are fewer senior staff to support those in the field. ABC journalists and former correspondents told Weekly Beast the drafting of Williams and Brisso exposed the “gaping hole” at the public broadcaster, where journalistic ranks had been “hollowed out in the middle”. Coalition cuts totalling $783m since 2014 have resulted in fewer staff, while the demand for continuous news coverage has increased. A lot has changed in Ukraine in the last few days. @isabellahiggins and I have been in Lviv. The city and atmosphere has changed a lot. Here are a few more photos I’ve taken: An ABC spokesperson said: “The ABC currently has reporters, producers and camera operators on the ground across Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, the UK and the US. They are all doing a superb job. A wide range of other expert voices is also adding to the coverage. The coverage has been comprehensive and of the highest quality and the huge audience response demonstrates its value to Australians.” While Fremantle only confirmed this week that Neighbours will come to end in June, the soapie’s producers have been thinking about how to craft the end of the 37-year-old story for months. The executive producer, Jason Herbison, has revealed that the fictional suburb of Erinsborough will not end with a bang, or anything as dramatic as a bomb, which will be a relief to the 1.5 million Britons and north of 100,000 Aussies who watch the series every day. “Ramsay Street is eternal and I like to think it will live on in the hearts and minds of the viewers long after the final scene,” Herbison told TV Tonight after the announcement on Thursday. “I would never, ever blow it up. The ending will be a celebration of the past and the present, with the door very much left open for a future.” The door has even been left open for a revival. Fremantle said the show would be “rested” and not axed, although the cast and crew would be let go. After a bruising week of staff leaking against him and Twitter critics hammering him, the Sydney Morning Herald editor, Bevan Shields, it was left to the celebrated SMH journalist Kate McClymont to appeal for readers to remain calm. Shields’ initial insistence on the morning of the train shutdown that it was a “strike” rather than a lockout dominated the gossip at the industry event. Shields blamed “a few activist accounts” on Twitter for whipping up the furore over the issue, with the Herald later describing it as a “shutdown”. After picking up her ninth Walkley – for best print report for her Melissa Caddick story – McClymont thanked people for praising her journalism but asked them to give Shields a chance because he was new to the job. It didn’t go down well. Thanks so much, that is greatly appreciated. But can I ask that people please give @BevanShields a decent go. He's only been in the job a couple of weeks. https://t.co/IaKfCrG8Li There is a great deal of competition among authors to get a review published in a newspaper. The Australian’s literary editor, Caroline Overington, says she receives 200 requests for reviews each week and can only select 10 to 15. If a book is self-published and not supported by a major publishing house, getting a spot in the Oz or the Herald is even harder. But a self-published book by the celebrated cricket writer Gideon Haigh was not only reviewed in the Weekend Australian, it was given a second plug in Overington’s editor’s column in the Review section. “In today’s Books pages you will find a review of an Edwardian murder mystery in which the weapon is a cricket bat,” Overington wrote of Roy Hay’s review. “Gideon Haigh has self-published, making the book available only through his website, in the main to ensure the quality of the design and printing.” Overington goes on to say she welcomes self-published novels. Haigh has been a cricket writer for the Oz for many years and it’s not unusual for the paper to cover the literary work of its own writers, but Overington didn’t mention that Haigh is her partner. We asked Overington if she should have disclosed her relationship with the author but she didn’t respond. The ABC’s floods coverage has been excellent and a decision to send presenters out into the field has paid off. The ABC news channel presenter Joe O’Brien and News Breakfast’s finance reporter, Madeleine Morris, and meteorologist, Nate Byrne, have all been out in the rain, bringing immediacy to the story. Morris even helped stranded residents into a boat. She wasn’t alone in helping out. Seven’s Matt Doran climbed on to a roof during a live cross and Nine’s Jessica Millward paddled up to stranded residents in a canoe. 5! pic.twitter.com/PKiTe6p9ef With all those reporters in the field the ABC 7pm bulletin couldn’t resist having five of them in different locations in one live cross. But Seven News went even further, putting 10 reporters in the field in one live cross box. Any reporter who has covered courts in Sydney has come across the legendary 2GB court reporter Gil Taylor, who has been on the beat for more than a decade. Taylor retired last week, prompting an outpouring of appreciation from journalists who had worked alongside him. Farewell to legendary 2GB court reporter Gil Taylor @873gt, who departs court today after a stellar career. His professionalism and strong moral compass will be sorely missed in the legal district.

3/4/2022,"Fire has broken out at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant located in Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine, according to an announcement from the mayor of the nearby town of Energodar. “As a result of continuous enemy shelling of buildings and units of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is on fire,” Dmytro Orlov said on his Telegram channel. Russian forces were in control of local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol. Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on the Ukrainian capital. At least 33 civilians were killed in a Russian airstrike on a residential area in the northern city of Chernihiv on Thursday, Ukrainian authorities said. The death toll across Ukraine has continued to rise. Vladimir Putin has told Emmanuel Macron that Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means he will continue to pursue his war in Ukraine, France’s presidential Élysée Palace has said, adding: “We expect the worst is yet to come.” In a televised speech shortly after his 90-minute call with Macron, Putin claimed Russian military operations in Ukraine were going according to plan. The president went on to accuse Ukrainian forces of using civilians as “human shields” but provided no evidence. Ukraine and Russia agreed to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians in a second round of talks on Thursday afternoon, but the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the outcome of the talks had fallen short of Ukraine’s hopes. A third round of talks was set to take place at the start of next week, the Belarus state news agency Belta cited Podolyak as saying. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for direct talks with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, saying it was “the only way to stop this war”. Speaking at a press conference, Zelenskiy called on the west to increase military aid to Ukraine, warning that the rest of Europe would be under threat if Russia was allowed to advance. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has imposed sanctions on the Uzbekistan-born Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, whose commercial links to Everton football club have been suspended; and on the Russian former deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov, the Foreign Office has said. The BBC has been blocked inside Russia, according to GlobalCheck, which tracks internet censorship. It comes after the EU blocked the Russian state-run media sites Sputnik and RT. The Pentagon has established communication with the Russian defence ministry “for the purpose of preventing miscalculation, military incidents, and escalation”, a US defence official told the AP. That such a “deconfliction” line has been established was not yet officially announced, but multiple news organisations confirmed the news. The line was reportedly established on 1 March.

3/4/2022,"The Coalition’s anti-trolling bill has come under fire from the Business Council of Australia, which has claimed it may breach the US free trade agreement and joined those warning it may increase online abuse. The BCA has urged that the bill not proceed, arguing in a submission to a Senate inquiry it would have “limited impact on safety outcomes” while resulting in “substantial changes” to defamation law. The Morrison government released the proposed anti-trolling bill in early December, claiming it could help victims of trolling by incentivising social media companies to set up complaints-handling procedures that can reveal the identities of anonymous commenters. The bill primarily helps operators of social media accounts by deeming they are not the publishers of comments by other users on their posts. The Law Council and academics David Rolph and Michael Douglas have warned deeming those operating social media pages not liable for defamation and giving social media companies a defence may worsen online abuse and harm victims’ access to justice. The BCA submitted to the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee that the commonwealth lacks constitutional power to legislate on defamation. The “carve-out” for page owners “poses substantial problems, including potentially increasing the volume of defamatory or otherwise problematic material posted, as page owners will have less incentive to moderate comments”, it said. The BCA also raised the alarm about the provision requiring social media companies with more than 250,000 Australian users to have a “nominated entity” in Australia to comply with local obligations. The BCA said this “appears in breach of the [Australia US free trade agreement]” which “explicitly states that neither party will ‘require a service supplier of the other party to establish or maintain a representative office … in its territory as a condition for the cross-border supply of a service”. The eSafety commissioner said the bill may lead to confusion because it “seeks to address defamation but uses the terminology of trolling”. It also warned of unintended consequences, including social media companies needing to retrospectively gather contact details for their users in order to benefit from the defence of having a compliant complaints procedure. “This would be a complicated and arguably burdensome requirement for industry, with Facebook alone counting 17 million Australian monthly users. “eSafety believes some users may be hesitant to provide these details to services due to lack of trust, and others may have difficulty complying.” The eSafety commissioner argued this could have a disproportionate impact on low-income households, if social media companies made provision of those details a condition of providing the service. The anti-bullying charity Alannah and Madeleine Foundation submitted that the uptake by children and young people of improved procedures to get court orders to identify trolls is likely to be low. “This is not because children and young people do not experience false and damaging reputational claims online – in fact, that problem seems relatively common – but rather because resolving the problem through formal defamation proceedings is unlikely to be an accessible or appealing option for many young Australians.” The small and family business ombudsman, Bruce Billson, submitted that “more should be done to ensure the proactive removal of unfounded and malicious reviews” of small businesses on platforms such as Google, UberEATS and Facebook.",News/Australia news,"Anti-trolling bill could breach US free trade deal and increase online abuse, BCA says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/04/anti-trolling-bill-could-breach-us-free-trade-deal-and-increase-online-abuse-bca-says
3/4/2022,"Experts have urged Sydneysiders to avoid swimming at murky beaches due to increased risk of shark encounters following torrential rain that has caused devastating damage along Australia’s east coast. There have been numerous shark sightings in Sydney in recent days. On Tuesday, the Northern Beaches Council issued an alert that a shark more than 3 metres long had been spotted off Manly Beach, which was subsequently closed. The Manly Observer reported that it had been “receiving reports from local surfers and swimmers all week”, and Surf Life Saving NSW also reported an unidentified 2.5 metre shark off the beach on Monday morning. A spokesperson for the Northern Beaches Council said there had been no further sightings since Tuesday. Last week, in the days after a fatal shark attack at Little Bay – the first in Sydney waters since 1963 – two tiger sharks were tagged and released from drumlines off Clovelly and Malabar Beach. A spokesperson for the NSW Department of Primary Industries said there was no evidence to suggest that shark numbers were increasing in the coastal and estuarine waters of Sydney, but that the risk of shark encounters increased in murky waters after heavy rainfall. “Run-off and nutrients from the land run into our waterways and can attract fish and other animals to feed – this can then attract sharks,” the spokesperson said. “Reduced water visibility can make conditions ideal for ambush predators, like sharks, to hunt in. Our recommendation is to avoid the water during these conditions.” Prof Nathan Hart of Macquarie University said the increased rainfall was pushing effluent and rubbish into waterways. “It delivers a lot of nutrients into coastal waters, and that can sometimes attract particular prey species into the area,” he said. “Inevitably, you might get some predators coming in to feed on those fish as well.” A modelling study Hart co-authored in 2019 found that the risk of shark attacks by certain species was linked to wet weather. “Tiger sharks, for instance – their attack risk increases with rainfall,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sydney, which has had its wettest summer in 30 years, saw 356mm of rain this February. Hart’s research found the risk of great white shark encounters increased with mean monthly rainfall up to a limit of 100mm, but dropped above that – a finding Hart attributes to a “complex interaction between season, the type of stuff that’s being washed down, and just how much has been washed down in those rivers”. Great white shark attack risk was also significantly higher with warmer sea surface temperatures, the study found. A key driver of the wet 2021–22 summer in New South Wales has been an ongoing marine heatwave in the Tasman Sea. Sightings of large great white sharks were rare, Hart said, adding that during marine heatwaves great whites seem to move into waters closer to the coast, where upwelling currents bring cold water up from the deep. “When the water gets warm … white sharks actually seek out those cooler waters,” he said. “Whether that’s because their prey are going there, or just because physiologically the water is too hot and they’re trying to find colder pockets, we don’t really know.” Dr Vanessa Pirotta, a marine predator researcher, said the higher than usual temperatures could have implications for where sharks moved as a result of following prey. “We have seen higher temperatures, persisting for a longer period of time on the east coast, and it seems to be strengthening in some areas. This is likely to have changes for the way in which animals are distributed in the marine environment,” she said. “It would be very tricky to tie all the environmental variables to why we’re seeing sharks when we are,” she said. “It’s a big ocean and these animals are capable of large geographical movements.” Research from the NSW Department of Primary Industries has found that sharks are present in the state’s waters year round. Great white sharks were mostly present in sea surface temperatures between 18 and 24C in NSW, the department said. “Bull sharks are more numerous in the estuaries and coastal waters of Sydney over the summer and autumn months, when water temperatures increase.” “By tagging and tracking the movements of sharks, we know that sharks are not resident to any particular location along the NSW coast. White sharks tagged off the NSW coast have been tracked to Western Australia, Papua New Guinea, Tasmania, sub-Antarctic islands, New Zealand, and New Caledonia.” “Data from our tagged sharks indicates that most juvenile white sharks move northward along the NSW coast in late autumn and early winter.”",News/Australia news,Shark warnings at popular Sydney beaches as rain and floods muddy the waters,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/04/shark-warnings-at-popular-sydney-beaches-as-rain-and-floods-muddy-the-waters
