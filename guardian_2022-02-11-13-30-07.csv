2/11/2022,"Anthony Albanese says the head of spy agency Asio has not raised any concerns with him about Labor’s federal election candidates, stating Peter Dutton is engaged in “game-playing” with national security issues. The Nine newspapers on Friday reported “multiple security sources” had said a Chinese intelligence service was behind a recently disrupted foreign interference plot that had “attempted to bankroll NSW Labor candidates in the upcoming federal election”.  Guardian Australia has been unable to verify the claim aired on the eve of Saturday’s by-elections in four NSW state seats. It comes as the Morrison government is facing internal divisions, damaging cabinet leaks and poor poll numbers ahead of the federal election due by May. NSW Labor said on Friday the Nine report was the first it had heard of the allegations. It said the Asio chief, Mike Burgess, had “never raised these matters” with either the leader of the state party, Chris Minns, or the NSW general secretary, Bob Nanva. The report was published a day after Dutton, the defence minister, levelled an accusation in federal parliament that the Chinese Communist party had “made a decision about who they’re going to back in the next federal election … and they have picked this bloke [Albanese] as that candidate”. According to the Nine newspapers, unnamed security sources confirmed that Dutton was referring to a Chinese plot to interfere with NSW Labor’s preselection process. Albanese hit back on Friday, saying national security was “too important to engage in game-playing, such as what we saw on the floor of the parliament yesterday, however much the government needs a distraction”. The federal Labor leader said he took national security seriously and had regular briefings with the Asio chief. Albanese said he had spoken directly with Burgess on Friday morning. “The Asio director-general has publicly stated that if he had concerns about attempts at foreign interference in political parties he’ll raise them directly with the party leader,” Albanese told reporters in Melbourne. “I have total confidence in all of my candidates, and the director-general of Asio has never raised a concern about any of my candidates.” Albanese said that in Friday’s call Burgess “reaffirmed that he has not raised concern about any of my candidates”. “I can’t be clearer than that,” he said. Albanese said it would be “entirely inappropriate” to discuss national security briefings as that would endanger security “and the capacity of our agencies to operate clear of political interference”. But the Labor leader said the government’s claim that an Albanese government would “appease” China if elected was “desperate” given the major parties had the same position on Beijing’s trade sanctions, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the South China Sea, human rights concerns, foreign interference and cyber security. Albanese said he was “not going to sit back and cop the sort of nonsense that’s being put forward from a government that sat back” while a Chinese company was given a long-term lease over the Port of Darwin. Earlier, Dutton has told ABC radio there was “no doubt in [his] mind” about what he described as a “statement of the obvious” regarding China’s preference of Labor. He claimed he based Thursday’s inflammatory allegation on “open source and other intelligence”. The personal attack on the Labor leader was echoed by Scott Morrison, who claimed in parliament on Thursday that “those who are seeking to coerce Australia” knew that “their candidate” in the election was “the leader of the Labor party”. The former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull – who oversaw the introduction of tougher foreign interference laws – said on Friday that Dutton’s claim was “reckless” because it “undermines Australian security” and “uses matters of grave national security purely for crass political advantage”. “The proposition that Albanese is under influence of the CCP is ludicrous,” Turnbull told the ABC. In his threat assessment speech on Wednesday evening, Burgess disclosed that Asio had “recently detected and disrupted a foreign interference plot” in the run-up to “an election in Australia”. Burgess was vague when describing the election targeted and he did not say which country was responsible. He noted Australia was “seeing attempts at foreign interference at all levels of government – in all states and territories”. Burgess said the case “involved a wealthy individual who maintained direct and deep connections with a foreign government and its intelligence agencies”. The goal, he said, was “secretly shaping the jurisdiction’s political scene to benefit the foreign power”. Burgess also said attempts at political interference were “not confined to one side of politics”. The issue is likely to be raised when the Asio chief is questioned at the next round of Senate estimates next week. Nanva, the NSW Labor general secretary, said foreign interference was a real and growing threat and the party took that seriously. He said no national security agency had ever raised “these alleged matters” with the parliamentary leadership or the organisational wing. “We are concerned about the timing and source of these allegations,” Nanva said on Friday. The political dispute over national security coincides with Australia hosting the foreign ministers of the US, Japan and India for a Quad meeting in Melbourne. Prof Rory Medcalf, the head of the Australian National University’s national security college, said the foreign minister, Marise Payne, should reassure her Quad counterparts that Australia could be trusted on security “no matter who wins government”. Australia’s national interests require the Foreign Minister to reassure her Quad counterparts they can have confidence in Australia as a security partner, no matter who wins government. Jason Wood, the federal assistant minister for customs, community safety and multicultural affairs, has already sought to campaign on the issue. He published a post on Facebook on Friday afternoon headlined: “CCP DESPERATE FOR ALBO TO BE ELECTED”. The home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, declined to comment on intelligence matters. Comment was also sought from Dutton, Asio and the Chinese embassy.",News/Australia news,Anthony Albanese hits back at ‘nonsense’ suggestion China wants Labor to win federal poll,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/11/anthony-albanese-hits-back-at-nonsense-suggestion-china-wants-labor-to-win-federal-poll
