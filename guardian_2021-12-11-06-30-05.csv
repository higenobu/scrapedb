12/11/2021,"The veteran newsreader Simon McCoy has become the latest senior figure to leave GB News. McCoy is poised to leave in January for “personal reasons” with his morning slot on the rightwing news channel to be taken over by Eamonn Holmes and former Sky News newsreader Isabel Webster.  GB News’ chief executive, Angelos Frangopoulos, described former BBC News presenter McCoy as an “outstanding broadcaster” and told the Daily Telegraph: “We remain open to ways we can work with him again in future.” The 60-year-old was one of the station’s highest profile recruits when it launched earlier this year. He had become well known for his deadpan delivery of news on royal events. Holmes is scheduled to join GB News on 3 January after 15 years with ITV daytime show This Morning, which he presented with his wife Ruth Langsford. The broadcaster also spent 12 years presenting ITV breakfast show GMTV and 11 years at Sky News Sunrise, the morning show he co-presented with Webster. Holmes said: “I’ve been involved with broadcasting firsts for my whole career. I love them, I’m excited by them and I’m in my element when I’m doing them. “I’ve admired GB News from the start, for all the ways it is doing television news differently and breaking the mould. The industry needs a shake-up and I couldn’t wait to get on board. “I was at the inception of daytime programming in Britain, when the BBC launched the first-ever dedicated daytime service in 1986, and I was there on day one of GMTV, which we built from scratch and became the market leader. “Every time, people said it would fail, or there was no audience for it. Every time, we proved them wrong. GB News will be no different.” Holmes and Webster will also become the face of GB News Radio, a new DAB station being launched at the end of January. In September, the broadcaster Andrew Neil resigned as the rightwing network’s lead presenter and chairman.",News/Media,Simon McCoy becomes latest presenter to depart GB News,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/dec/10/simon-mccoy-becomes-latest-departure-from-gb-news
12/11/2021,"Grayson’s Art Club was a brilliantly and quickly conceived response to Britain’s pandemic-induced lockdowns. The first series covered the first two confinements, the second one our third – though you suspect not final – sheltering-in-place. The unflagging optimism of Grayson, and his equally indefatigable wife Philippa, framed the enforced hiatus as an opportunity for us to get stuck into something we might not otherwise do, and turn to art as a way of processing the unprecedented situation and expressing the otherwise inexpressible. Each series had six episodes, with a different theme each week, and asked the public to submit pieces on the subject with the aim of putting on an exhibition to mark the whole extraordinary experience once circumstances allowed. Grayson would interview with his usual warm skill some of the artists – even and especially if they wouldn’t call themselves that – by Zoom, drawing out their stories and feeding them back as further insight into their work specifically and the power of art in general. The programme garnered a million viewers a week and more than 17,000 members of the public submitted their artwork. Now Grayson’s Art Exhibition is here to showcase preparations for the event at the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery and talk – face to face this time! Oh, the heady intimacy and excitement! – with some of the people whose pieces will be on show.  Grayson accompanies wedding musician Tony Baine as he records the audio for one of his soundscape tapes; a little loop of actual cassette tape he runs through a miniature forest scene, say, to reproduce the effects of walking through it. Watching the tiny piece come together is – as the Art Club so often is – unexpectedly moving. The chosen contributions tend to snag a bit of your soul you didn’t even know was there. You can curse and bless their and Grayson’s sorcery as you turn into a tearful, soggy heap on the sofa. As ever, Grayson is on hand to put a few of the thoughts flickering around the edge of your consciousness into words before you can. “They’re so sweet,” he says of the little scenes suddenly alive with the sound of rushing rivers and crunching leaves, as Tony patiently threads his tapes and tends to his spooling stations. “It takes us back to a time when people messed around in sheds, had hobbies … Art draws our attention to the world in a new way. Is there a sensuality to mundane sounds we take for granted?” Tony says that hearing is his main sense. Now we hear him too. Then there is Becky Taylor, who has very little physical control over her body and communicates and creates her art entirely through eye-controlled digital technology. It is the most compressed message about the power of art to give control over life, expression to experience and to independent sensibility as you could find. Potter Michael Pennington – more widely known as comedian Johnny Vegas – gives a heartfelt and touching account of lockdown forcing him to acknowledge that making art is vital to him. “I’d be so disappointed in myself if I went back to treating it like a luxury I can ill-afford.” Lulu Willis has created a tableau of herself as a warrior queen, to stand for all those like her – a full-time carer for her behaviourally challenged son Matthew – who were invisible to the government and left to suffer multiple miseries during lockdown. “What I’d really like is for people just to know that we exist and that it’s a really difficult job we do.” The warrior queen is on show now.",Arts/Television & radio,Grayson’s Art Club: An Exhibition for Britain review – its sorcery will turn you into a soggy heap,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/10/graysons-art-club-an-exhibition-for-britain-review-its-sorcery-will-turn-you-into-a-soggy-heap

12/11/2021,"Sonia Sotomayor, the liberal-leaning justice on the US supreme court, put it plainly. For almost three months, lawmakers in the Republican-controlled legislature of Texas had “substantially suspended a constitutional guarantee: a pregnant woman’s right to control her own body”. “The court should have put an end to this madness months ago,” Sotomayor said.  But when the supreme court issued on Friday its majority opinion on SB8, the extreme Texas law that bans abortions effectively at six weeks, in blatant violation of the court’s own constitutional rulings, it still didn’t put an end to the madness. It allowed the law, the most restrictive currently in force in the US, to remain in effect. And by varying margins, the new conservative supermajority of the court, consolidated by Donald Trump’s appointment of three new rightwing justices, restricted the legal route by which abortion providers could challenge the law. From now on the legal battle would have to be focused narrowly on just four state employees responsible for medical licensing in the state. Other Texas officials involved, notably the state’s attorney general Ken Paxton and clerks in state courts, would be let off the hook. Even more provocatively, while the court sent the abortion fight back to a federal district court in Austin, it let the ban itself stand. That adds insult to injury given the supreme court’s much-criticised refusal to stay the ban at the start, not to mention the many weeks it has taken to hand down its decision. Over those weeks, Texas women have paid a heavy price. “The court’s delay in allowing this case to proceed has had catastrophic consequences for women seeking to exercise their constitutional right to an abortion in Texas,” Sotomayor said in a powerful dissenting opinion. In September alone, the first month of the ban, the number of legal abortions performed in Texas plummeted to about half the level a year ago. That was the largest recorded decline in the state’s recent history, with untold numbers of women forced to seek abortions out of state or carry unwanted pregnancies to term. Sotomayor, who is emerging as a pivotal voice of resistance within the post-Trump court, was forthright in her choice of words. Her disagreement with the conservative justices went far beyond a “quibble” over which state officials abortion providers can sue, she said. The question was: is the supreme court prepared to stand up in the name of constitutional rights to the cynical antics of ideologically driven Republicans in states such as Texas? “The choice to shrink from Texas’s challenge to federal supremacy will have far-reaching repercussions,” Sotomayor warned. “I doubt the court, let alone the country, is prepared for them.” Nobody can doubt that SB 8 is a flagrant violation of the constitutional right to an abortion enshrined in the 1973 landmark ruling Roe v Wade. While Roe sets the bar of fetal viability at about 24 weeks, Texas now puts it at the point of earliest cardiac activity, around six weeks – before many women even know they are pregnant. Neil Gorsuch, one of the three Trump appointees, who wrote Friday’s majority opinion, said that the issue of the constitutional right to an abortion was not under consideration in this case. The matter at hand in the Texas law was whether abortion providers could press on with their challenge to the ban by suing specific state officials. That will do little to assuage the jitters of 80% of Americans who think that abortions should be legal in all or certain circumstances. In a separate case before the supreme court based on a new Mississippi ban at 15 weeks, which is now blocked by a lower court, Roe v Wade is very much up for grabs, and the signs are ominous. In oral arguments in the Mississippi case less than two weeks ago, several of the conservative justices indicated they were willing to sharply restrict or even overturn the right to an abortion despite its rock-steady standing as a pillar of constitutional law for almost 50 years. Nor does Gorsuch’s protestation that Friday’s case was merely focused on procedural matters offer much comfort. SB 8 was devised by Texas Republicans as a juridical trick to skirt around constitutional protections by making it more difficult for abortion providers to challenge the law in federal court. At the heart of the legislation is a ruse designed to make a mockery of federal oversight. Enforcement of the abortion ban is transferred from state officials who are vulnerable to federal challenge to private individuals, armed with financial inducements of up to $10,000 to cover legal fees. “SB 8 is structured to thwart review and result in ‘a denial of any hearing’,” Sotomayor decried. “The events of the last three months have shown that the law has succeeded in its endeavor.” That is why the vote of the court’s new post-Trump majority to issue such a narrow opinion over SB 8 is more than a “quibble”. The highest court in the nation has been defied by a group of extremist Republicans openly flouting the court’s own rulings. In response, the conservative majority emboldened by Trump has opted not to insist on respect for the constitutional law of the land, but instead to blithely play along. As Sotomayor put it: “By so doing, the court leaves all manner of constitutional rights more vulnerable than ever before, to the great detriment of our constitution and our republic.” Perhaps most tellingly, the idea of appeasing Texas Republicans in their attempt to undermine the supreme court’s own precedents proved too much even for John Roberts, the chief justice. In important aspects of Friday’s decision, he broke with his five fellow conservative justices and sided pointedly with Sotomayor and the liberal minority. “The clear purpose and actual effect of SB 8 has been to nullify this court’s rulings,” Roberts said, in words which may reverberate down the years. “The role of the supreme court in our constitutional system is at stake.”",News/US news,Sotomayor decries abortion ruling but court’s conservatives show their muscle,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/10/supreme-court-abortion-ruling-texas-ban
12/11/2021,"It was not quite the grand switching on ceremony that Downing Street had anticipated for its Christmas lights. A Labour MP has admitted she unwittingly turned on the lights early after mistaking the switch for a doorbell. Carolyn Harris, MP for Swansea East, attended a meeting at No 10 last Wednesday but said that, when the door failed to open, she pressed a grey button nearby.  The door then opened at the same time as the Christmas tree lit up, an hour earlier than scheduled. Ironically Boris Johnson’s first attempt at switching on the festive lights was unsuccessful in front of an audience of children who sang carols. After a countdown, footage posted on social media showed the prime minister pressing the switch only for the lights to flicker on for a second before turning off again. The lights remained on after a second press of the button. Harris told BBC Radio Wales: “I got to the door and I’m waiting for the door to open and it doesn’t. I think ‘that’s odd, I thought the door automatically opened’. “So I looked on the wall and there’s this grey box, so I think it’s a doorbell, so I press the grey box – the front door does open – but the Christmas tree lights came on at the same time. I get inside and I say ‘the tree looks lovely’ and they say ‘yes, the prime minister is going to switch them on at five o’clock for the carol service’. “So I said ‘I think you’ll find I’ve already done that’, so I had to go back outside to turn the tree lights off, which was quite funny, especially when the prime minister did turn them on an hour later and they didn’t work the first time he tried it.” Harris said she “cried laughing” with fellow MPs afterwards, adding: “I don’t know if the prime minister will be very happy that somebody beat him to it after the week he’s had.”",News/Politics,Labour MP admits accidently switching on No 10 Christmas lights early,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/10/labour-mp-admits-accidently-switching-on-no-10-christmas-lights-early
