3/6/2022,"A 29-year-old personal trainer died from a caffeine overdose in 2021, an inquest heard. Tom Mansfield got his ""maths wrong"" when measuring a dose of caffeine powder, the coroner said. He ingested up to 5g (0.2 oz) of caffeine powder, which is equivalent to up to 200 cups of coffee. A personal trainer died from an overdose after accidentally ingesting a powder with caffeine levels equivalent to up to 200 cups of coffee, an inquest heard, per reports. Tom Mansfield, 29, bought a 100g (3.5 oz) bag of caffeine powder from Blackburn Distributions, a British sports supplements company, according to BBC News. The recommended dose of caffeine powder, which is often used by gymgoers to aid their performance, was between 60 300mg (0.002 and 0.01 oz). But Mansfield's digital scale had a starting weight of 2g (0.07 oz), and the product did not come with a measuring scoop, Yahoo! News reported. The father-of-two from Colwyn Bay, Wales, miscalculated his measurement and scooped up to 5g (0.2 oz) of the powder, the inquest heard, per Yahoo! News. Coroner John Gittins said Manfield had been aiming for the ""mid-range of the recommended dose,"" but ""he got his maths wrong,"" per BBC. Mansfield took a sip of the mixture before downing the rest of the drink on January 5, 2021, the media outlet said. The inquest heard that he began clutching his chest and complaining that his heart was beating fast, BBC News reported. Minutes later, the media outlet said, he started foaming at the mouth. Paramedics arrived at his home and tried to resuscitate him for 45 minutes before pronouncing him dead at a hospital. A post-mortem examination showed Mansfield had caffeine levels of 392mg per liter of blood, per BBC News. The cause of death was marked as caffeine toxicity. A typical coffee contains 2 to 4 mg per liter, meaning that he consumed the equivalent of up to 200 cups. According to North Wales Live, the coroner said that had Mansfield been provided with a scoop, he would likely still be alive today. Gittins said he had been ""massively reassured"" that Blackburn Distributions now provides a scoop with this brand of caffeine powder, the media outlet said.

3/6/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday that Western sanctions on Russia were akin to a declaration of war and warned that any attempt to impose a no-fly zone in Ukraine would be tantamount to entering the conflict. Putin reiterated that his aims in Ukraine are to defend Russian speaking communities through the ""demilitarisation and de-Nazification"" of the country so that it became neutral. Ukraine and Western countries have dismissed this as a baseless pretext for the invasion he launched on Feb. 24 and have imposed a sweeping range of sanctions aimed at isolating Moscow. ""These sanctions that are being imposed are akin to a declaration of war but thank God it has not come to that,"" Putin said, speaking to a group of women flight attendants at an Aeroflot training centre near Moscow. He said any attempt by another power to impose a no-fly zone in Ukraine would be considered by Russia to be a step into the military conflict. NATO has rejected Kyiv's request for a no-fly zone, on the grounds it would escalate the war beyond Ukraine. Putin said there were no conscripts involved in the military operation, which he said was being carried out only by professional soldiers. ""There is not one conscript and we don't plan for there to be,"" Putin said. ""Our army will fulfil all the tasks. I don't doubt that at all. Everything is going to plan."" Putin dismissed concerns that some sort of martial law or emergency situation could be declared in Russia. He said such a measure was imposed only when there was significant internal or external threat. ""We don't plan to introduce any kind of special regime on Russian territory - there is currently no need,"" Putin said. His government has clamped down on protests in Russia against the war.

3/6/2022,"(Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Saturday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's attempt to secure direct NATO help in the conflict between their countries was not helping talks between the two sides. ""Constant angry statements from Mr Zelenskiy do not increase optimism,"" Lavrov told reporters on Saturday. In particular, he mentioned Zelenskiy's strong criticism of the Western military alliance on Friday for refusing to intervene in the conflict by preventing Russian missiles and warplanes using Ukrainian airspace. ""My question is: If he is so upset that NATO has not intervened on his behalf as he hoped, then he expects to resolve the conflict by involving NATO in all this, and not through talks?"" Lavrov said. Earlier, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he was open to talks with Lavrov, but only if they were ""meaningful"". Russia invaded Ukraine by land, sea and air on Feb. 24, in what it calls a ""special military operation"". Wary of being dragged into Moscow's war on its neighbour, NATO on Friday turned down Zelenskiy's appeal to create a no-fly zone over Ukraine, prompting the Ukrainian president to say that the alliance had given Russia the green light to continue its bombing campaign. Russian and Ukrainian delegations from Moscow and Kyiv have held two rounds of talks, the latest on Thursday, after which they said they had agreed on the need to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians, but not much else. Lavrov said Moscow was ready for a third round, but had not received new dates from the Ukrainian side, which he said was inventing pretexts to delay the process. The Kremlin said on Friday that progress in the negotiations would depend on Kyiv's reaction to Moscow's position on how to end the war, which had been conveyed to Ukraine on Thursday.
