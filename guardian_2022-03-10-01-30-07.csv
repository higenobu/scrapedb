3/10/2022,"Russian speakers in the UK are being urged to phone ordinary citizens in Russia to counter the Kremlin’s propaganda and media blackout about the war in Ukraine. The #CallRussia initiative, which was launched on Tuesday, urges volunteers to cold call Russians in order to challenge Vladimir Putin’s narrative about the invasion one conversation at a time. It uses an open database of 40m phone numbers in Russia, which members of the Russian diaspora in the UK and elsewhere have begun to call, in an ambitious non-violent campaign to help end the war. Volunteers include Lidia, a 29-year-old Moscow-born accountant from Huddersfield. “This is great way to try to make a connection with real people who in my view have the power to enact change in Russia,” she told the Guardian. Guidelines for volunteers begin with the warning that calls “will be very difficult”. Of the more than 20 calls Lidia has made so far, many have ended abruptly with phone being banged down as soon as she mention Ukraine. Others she has called have asked hostile question such as “who in the west is paying you?” But Lidia already feels she has changed some minds in Russia. She said: “You only need one conversation where you feel you have made someone doubt what they are hearing day in and day out on state media to make you feel like it’s worth it.” One of her first calls was to a woman called Natalia who believed the foreign media was trying discredit Putin and his “liberation mission for Russian speakers”. But Lidia probed a bit further, and shared accounts by members of her family who have been trying escape the besieged city of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine. It was then that Natalia admitted she knew of friends and family in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro who had witnessed the killing of women and children. “I said ‘why would they say that if it wasn’t true?’ Eventually there was a silence because there is no real explanation,” Lidia said. She sensed that Natalia was beginning to question the official line from Moscow. Lidia said: “What is being presented in Russia about the ‘liberation mission’ and nazism in Ukraine is nonsense, but if you hear it every day you need a different perspective from someone who doesn’t.” She added: “It came across as if Natalia got all her information from state TV. That is close to me, because I have grandparents in Russia who believe all that.” Lidia is determined to continue making calls to Russia during her lunch break at work and when she gets home. She said: “I want to carry on because I feel there is a strength in numbers – the more you do the better chance you have to sway as many people as possible. I firmly believe that the only way in which Putin’s regime can come down is from the inside.” It is an approach that is shared by the Paulius Senūta, one of the founders of the #CallRussia initiative, who said: “One conversation cannot overcome Putin’s evil propaganda but millions might. Russians empowered with truth and compassion are the only ones who can stand up against Putin’s lies and end this war.”",News/World news,UK volunteers urged to cold call Russia to counter Putin’s propaganda ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/call-russia-initiative-aims-to-counter-russian-propaganda-over-ukraine
3/10/2022,"As military conflict has mounted between Ukraine and Russia, so have fears of unprecedented cyber war. Experts are monitoring both countries closely, fearing a volatile crisis involving one of the world’s leading hacking super powers could lead to a massive conflict playing out online – one that could outlast the physical battles. Joe Biden preemptively warned Russia that the US is “prepared to respond” to any attacks on critical infrastructure, and academics have warned of a Cyber Pearl Harbor. But thus far, experts say, it has been relatively quiet on the cyber warfront. “Though it would be foolhardy to rule it out in the future, we have not yet seen the completely destructive attacks on Ukraine infrastructure some anticipated,” said Glenn S Gerstell, former general counsel of the National Security Agency and Central Security Service. Fears of cyber warfare are stoked by a long history of international attacks coordinated out of Russia. The country was behind a large-scale attack on Ukraine’s power grid in 2015 in coordination with its annexation of Crimea. In 2017, Moscow unleashed onto Ukraine the data-wiping NotPetya virus, a destructive malware that ultimately spread globally. In addition, non-government Russian hackers have been linked to several brazen hacking schemes in past years, including the debilitating 2021 ransomware hack of the Colonial pipeline in the US. Coinciding with its invasion of Ukraine, Russia unleashed a number of smaller hacks – starting in January when more than 70 Ukrainian websites were defaced and separate cyber-attacks knocked out government websites including the ministry of foreign affairs and the education ministry. While these attacks have been “significant and unprecedented,” according to Aaron Turner of California cybersecurity firm Vectra, they have “not yet been catastrophic”. That is largely because no international power yet wants to be the one to cast the first stone in a cyber third world war, he said. “We have most likely reached a sort of detente, where both sides understand that catastrophic cyber attacks will most likely result in mutually-assured destruction of systems,” he added. National powers are also now better prepared to stave off attacks than they were previously, so it is possible some larger hacks have been quietly thwarted, experts said. The US has invested billions in cyber defense resources – both from private and public sources. Ukraine spent the past seven years in the wake of its power grid attack in 2015 steeling its infrastructure. “There has been a lot of thought and hard work put into preparing for an all-out assault on the cyber domain,” said Theresa Payton, cybersecurity expert and former White House chief information officer. “If we were to experience a hit to critical infrastructure, there are many playbooks in place to avoid sustained outages. Russia also seems to be investing more resources in coordinated disinformation campaigns than overt hacking operations, said Payton. Several US tech firms have been forced to take measures after Ukrainian officials pleaded with them to address the stream of Russian disinformation that has exploded ion their platforms. Disinformation experts have reported Russia is leading a coordinated campaign to push false narratives around the invasion of Ukraine, including doctored videos and disinformation. Russian officials have blocked access to social media in the country to prevent the spread of information that does not fit its narrative. Gerstell, the former NSA general counsel, said it is not unexpected for Putin to preference a disinformation-heavy strategy over destructive hacks. An attack on infrastructure would be treated as “equivalent to a physical attack by a bomb or missile”, he said, while propaganda falls into a gray area. “These are all acts that fall below the threshold of an act of war, but are very malicious and damaging nonetheless,” he said. Payton also noted that just because there have not yet been major attacks does not mean that there will not be in the future – or that there are not others in progress now. Many covert operations, especially those on a large scale, take time to unfurl, she said. In the case of the Solarwinds hack, for example, Russia’s massive breach of US organizations started in March 2020 was not revealed until December 2020. “There could be incidents already underway that we are not yet aware of,” she said. “With Russia, I always say that if you have not seen anything yet, just stay tuned.”",News/Technology,"‘Catastrophic’ cyber war between Ukraine and Russia hasn’t happened (yet), experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/09/catastrophic-cyber-war-ukraine-russia-hasnt-happened-yet-experts-say
3/10/2022,"Trevor Noah investigated pressure at the pump on Tuesday evening, as the US recorded its highest average gas price ever recorded: $4.17 per gallon, up ten cents in one day and 55 cents over last week. Some gas stations in Los Angeles hit nearly $7 a gallon. “If you thought gas prices were already high, Russia invading Ukraine has only made things worse,” the Daily Show host said. “Which sucks for everybody!” “It sucks for parents who need to drive kids to school, it sucks for small businesses who have to spend more money to move things around,” he continued. “It sucks for everyone, because the price of gas effects the price of everything. Like, if this keeps up, the next Fast and Furious movie is gonna take place on public transportation.” It’s particularly frustrating for people who can no longer afford to fuel their cars despite no change in salary or income. “Can we agree on this as a concept? It’s weird that the price of gas changes but like instantly at the pump,” Noah mused. “Do you get what I’m saying? I feel like the change should only affect the gas that’s on its way, not the gas that’s already there.” “You’ve really got to hand it to corporations when you think about it, man,” he added. “Because you hear people all the time being like, ‘Ah, the price of oil has gone up, so everything costs more.’ But they’ve done a great job of tricking all of us into thinking that prices are these magical things that nobody has control over.” Consumers understand that if the price of oil goes up, they pay more, “but who made that rule?” Noah wondered. “Oil companies are making windfall profits right now, over $100bn a year. Why can’t they take a hit? Just a tiny hit? “Because when prices go up, you know, the oil companies are there and they’re just making the money.” On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert expressed his admiration for Ukrainian president and former successful comedian Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who has emerged as a stalwart leader of a country under siege. “Normally I’m against electing comedians to political office – and keep in mind, I ran for president twice,” Colbert said, referencing his satirical runs as his Colbert Report character. “But this guy is inspiring the world with his courage in the face of the Russian invasion.” And on Monday evening, Zelenskiy “took his bravery to a whole new level of bad-assery” with a video filmed in Kyiv, where he has remained despite offers of an evacuation by the US and despite reports of assassination attempts. “I stay here. I stay in Kyiv,” he says in the video. “I’m not hiding, and I’m not afraid of anyone.” “That is so brave. I am personally inspired by his example,” Colbert said. “And I just want to say: Vladimir Putin, I’m not afraid of you, either! If you’re looking for this comedian, I’m at the Ed Sullivan Theatre on Broadway in Manhattan … five hours ago. We pre-taped this show.” As a response to Russia’s escalation of bombings in Ukraine, Joe Biden banned all Russian imports of oil and gas to the US. “Take that, Vlad! America doesn’t need your klepto-crude! America is perfectly happy to stay home and frack ourselves blind.” In response, Russia released a list of “unfriendly” countries including the US, Australia, the UK, Canada and South Korea. “Oh no, not an unfriendly list!” Colbert exclaimed, feigning concern. “This is the most devastating attack since Fidel Castro put JFK in his burn book.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers ribbed Biden’s latest approval rating of about 45%, “which if you’ve seen his past numbers, pretty much counts as beloved,” he said. “To the Biden camp, this is like Paul Rudd numbers.” As for Biden’s ban on Russian oil, natural gas and coal imports: “Honestly, I’m surprised Russia sends us any fuel since they can’t even get it to their tanks,” Meyers joked, referencing reports of abandoned and stalled Russian tanks throughout Ukraine. Meyers also admired Zelenskiy’s video from Kyiv, in which he said wasn’t hiding. “Dude, I salute your courage, but it’s fine if you hide,” said Meyers. “It’s a war, not WWE – ‘I’m right here, brother! Any time, any place.’”",Arts/Culture,Trevor Noah on gas prices: ‘The next Fast and Furious movie is gonna be on public transport’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/09/trevor-noah-late-night-tv-gas-prices
3/10/2022,"Members of the Democratic-controlled House judiciary committee have referred Amazon to the Department of Justice, alleging “potentially criminal conduct” by the company and some of its senior executives. In a letter to the attorney general, Merrick Garland, lawmakers claim that Amazon had engaged in a “pattern and practice of misleading conduct that suggests” it was acting to influence the committee’s investigation into online market competition. “Amazon repeatedly endeavored to thwart the Committee’s efforts to uncover the truth about Amazon’s business practices,” the congressional letter dated 9 March says. “We have no choice but to refer this matter to the Department of Justice to investigate whether Amazon and its executives obstructed Congress in violation of applicable federal law,” it added. Amazon said in a statement that “there’s no factual basis” for the committee’s move and that it had cooperated with the investigation. The existence of the letter, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, follows a warning from the committee in October that accused executives with the Seattle online retailing and cloud storage giant of either misleading Congress or possibly lying to it about Amazon’s business practices. A Reuters investigation last year cited documents that showed that Amazon had conducted a systematic campaign of copying products and rigging search results in India to boost sales of its own brands, or private-label brands – practices that Amazon denies. The congressional committee later claimed that news coverage “directly contradicts the testimony of Amazon’s executives including former CEO Jeffrey Bezos”. The company denied the allegations, responding that it “did not mislead the committee” and had “sought to correct the record on the inaccurate media articles in question”. But lawmakers claim the company had declined opportunities to demonstrate with evidence that it had made accurate and complete representations to the committee. The request to the justice department increases tension between political representatives and big tech, which is facing a number of investigations as well as calls for curbs to their market power, a virtual mirror of anti-trust suit faced by Microsoft in the 1990s. Two years ago, the same House antitrust subcommittee took issue with Amazon’s claims that its share of total US retail shopping is the most relevant way to understand its size – not its e-commerce dominance that accounts for about 39% of products purchased online. “Amazon functions as a gatekeeper for e-commerce,” the report said, and detailed what it claimed was how Amazon wields its size and platform to thwart competition. Amazon responded that “all large organizations attract the attention of regulators, and we welcome that scrutiny. But large companies are not dominant by definition, and the presumption that success can only be the result of anti-competitive behavior is simply wrong.” The latest escalation comes after committee members requested that Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, provide “exculpatory evidence” surrounding its private-label business practices. The company claimed that evidence from its own investigation into the issue was protected by attorney-client privilege. Amazon, the committee responded, “has refused to turn over business documents or communications” and “it appears to have done so to conceal the truth about its use of third-party sellers’ data to advantage its private-label business and its preferencing of private-label products in search results.”",News/Technology,Amazon referred to US attorney general over ‘potentially criminal conduct’,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/09/amazon-attorney-general-potentially-criminal-conduct-house-judiciary-committee
3/10/2022,"Britain is planning to supply Starstreak anti-aircraft weapons and “a small consignment” of Javelin anti-tank missiles to Ukraine as Russian forces close in on Kyiv to the east, the defence secretary has said. The UK would also continue to supply NLAW short-range anti-tank weapons, Ben Wallace told the Commons, and has already given Ukraine 3,615 of the portable missile systems – nearly double the 2,000 figure previously disclosed. Wallace said Ukraine had already received “900 man-portable anti-air missiles” – a reference to Stingers supplied by other Nato countries – but was desperately seeking more arms as Russian forces attempted to encircle Kyiv. “The capability needs strengthening,” Wallace said. “So in response to Ukrainian requests, the government has taken a decision to explore the donation of Starstreak high-velocity man-portable anti-air missiles.” Later, in response to questions from MPs as to how long the supply decision would take, Wallace said: “We are in principle going to do it.” He acknowledged Ukrainian soldiers would need to be trained in how to use the missiles. “How we are doing it [training] is sensitive,” he added. Starstreak is the British army’s equivalent to the better known US-made Stinger air-to-ground missiles that have been supplied to Ukraine by the US, Germany and the Netherlands among others since the Russian invasion. They are laser-guided with a range of 7km, unlike Stingers, which rely on infrared, and are designed to be harder to jam. Both Labour and the SNP urged Wallace to send the Starstreak and other missiles promptly. John Healey, Labour’s shadow defence secretary, called for the supply decision to be made “as quickly as possible”. A near identical plea followed from the SNPs Stuart McDonald. “This is only still week two,” Healey said. “Russia has such crushing firepower. Putin has such utter ruthlessness that we must expect more than one of his military objectives to be taken over the next few weeks.” Wallace told MPs that “the estimated number of Ukrainian civilians killed or injured now stands at over 1,000” and that “the true figure is expected to be much higher”. British funding to Ukraine would increase to £220m, of which £120m would be humanitarian aid, the minister said. People had been “without power and water for almost a week” in the south-eastern city of Mariupol, while unguided bombs had been dropped on Chernihiv, to the north-east of Kyiv, Wallace added. Russian forces were trying to encircle Kyiv, moving troops into the capital’s eastern Brovary suburb. The minister was also pressed on if he would support Poland supplying its 28 MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, with the Conservative bankbencher John Baron asking whether such an agreement would not represent a dangerous escalation of western involvement against Russia. “A wider war would not serve the interests of any population,” the MP said. In reply, Wallace said the decision was a matter for Poland, it was up to Warsaw to consider if it was a calibrated response to the crisis: “If the Polish government feels the security threat is so acute that it requires itself to do that, then I would fully understand their decision and stand by them.” On Wednesday, an apparent deal to send the MiGs to Ukraine via the US collapsed when the Pentagon said: “We do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one.” Poland had not wanted to send the jets directly for fear of provoking the Kremlin. Discussions about a possible supply of the fighter jets continued, the US said, although Wallace said in an earlier answer to McDonald he was not directly involved in those talks.",News/World news,"UK plans to send anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine, says Ben Wallace",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/uk-plans-to-send-anti-aircraft-weapons-to-ukraine-says-ben-wallace
3/10/2022,"Artificial intelligence could bring to life lost texts, from imperial decrees to the poems of Sappho, researchers have revealed, after developing a system that can fill in the gaps in ancient Greek inscriptions and pinpoint when and where they are from. Dr Thea Sommerschield, a co-author of the research at Ca’ Foscari University of Venice and Harvard University, said inscriptions were important as they were written directly by ancient people and were evidence of the thought, language, society and history of past civilisations. “But most surviving inscriptions have been damaged over the centuries. So their texts are now fragmentary or illegible,” she said, adding that they may also have been moved from their original location, while methods such as radiocarbon dating were unusable on materials such as stone. Writing in the journal Nature, Sommerschield and colleagues report how they built an AI system that they nicknamed Ithaca, after the Greek island that was home to the legendary King Odysseus. The team fed Ithaca more than 63,000 transcribed ancient Greek inscriptions, enabling it to pick out patterns in the order of letters and words, as well as associations between words and phrases and the age and provenance of the text. The team then tuned the system before exploring whether it could accurately suggest when and where another 7,811 inscriptions were from, and propose a selection of letters and words to fill in artificially created gaps in the inscriptions, ranked by probability. The results reveal that Ithaca achieved 62% accuracy when used alone to fill in the gaps in inscriptions, and 72% accuracy when the system’s suggestions were interpreted by a historian – about three times higher than when historians worked alone. The team said Ithaca was able to date the inscriptions to within 30 years of their established date and correctly identified their provenance 71% of the time. “Just as microscopes and telescopes have extended the range of what scientists can do today, Ithaca aims to singularly augment and expand the capabilities to study one of the most significant periods of human history,” said Dr Yannis Assael, a co-author of the work from the AI company DeepMind. The team said the approach could be used for any medium and any ancient written language, from Latin to Cuneiform, and it might be possible to train the system on Greek literary texts written on fragments of papyrus – an approach that could shed light on the writings of poets such as Sappho. There is also the potential to develop AI systems that could provide insights into the authorship of texts. The researchers said Ithaca had already been used on a set of decrees most of which were found on the Acropolis of Athens,suggesting one – relating to the collection of tributes across the Athenian empire – dated to 424BC rather than 448-7BC as was long thought, chiming with recent dating breakthroughs. “Although it might seem like a small difference, this 30-year shift has momentous repercussions for our understanding of the political history of classical Athens, and helps us better align literary sources – such as Thucydides’ account of these years and events– with the epigraphic record,” said Sommerschield. Prof Peter Liddel, an expert in Greek history and epigraphy at the University of Manchester who was not involved in the research, said even the provenance of many of the marbles brought back by Lord Elgin was unclear. “The application of AI through Ithaca certainly has the potential to contribute to the toolbox of historians involved in analysing ancient texts and using them to understand processes like the development of imperialism or the nature of cult activity,” he said. However, Liddel warned that, like scholars, AI was limited by gaps in the ancient record. “AI is only powerful as a tool to help us ask questions about, and make comparisons to, the existing evidence,” he said. Prof Melissa Terras, an expert in digital cultural heritage at the University of Edinburgh, said it was important to keep training scholars in traditional approaches to be able to develop AI systems such as Ithaca, and to interpret the suggestions they generate. But she said there was huge potential for AI to assist with interpretation of the past and its cultures given ancient texts were often fragmented yet followed structured formats. “This means they require a lot of cross-referencing for the human brain to solve the puzzle – but this is the type of repetitive calculation that [AI systems such as] deep neural nets excel at,” she said.",News/Science,"AI could decipher gaps in ancient Greek texts, say researchers",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/09/ai-could-decipher-gaps-in-ancient-greek-texts-say-researchers
3/10/2022,"Director Penny Marshall knocked it out of the park with this terrifically warm, heartfelt and effortlessly entertaining baseball picture, scripted by the veteran screenwriting duo Lowell Ganz and Marc “Babaloo” Mandel, in the spirit of old-fashioned films such as The Pride of the Yankees with Gary Cooper, or Knute Rockne, All American with Ronald “The Gipper” Reagan. It was inspired by the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, founded in the second world war because the men were all away fighting. It is outstandingly performed and Madonna, in a small role, is perfectly directed and cast in a way she was never to be again in the movies. David Strathairn plays the general manager, Mr Lowenstein, and the director Garry Marshall, brother of Penny, has a cameo as the league’s owner, Walter Harvey. Geena Davis, meanwhile, is excellent as Dottie Hinson, a farm worker whose husband is away in uniform: she loves to play baseball in an amateur league and so does her endlessly competitive kid sister Kit, played by Lori Petty. Ernie Capadino (Jon Lovitz) is the fledgling league’s obnoxious scout and he is keen to sign Dottie, and not Kit, but Dottie won’t join on her own. The pair are introduced to their team, the Peaches, and to their manager, the notorious drunk and has-been former player Jimmy Dugan – who, of course, gradually comes to love his players and finds redemption in managing them. Jimmy is played by Tom Hanks in that way he has of nullifying the supposedly bad parts of his character’s personality and somehow making them nice too. Hanks has to spit, urinate in front of the girls, behave objectionably and be hungover a lot. You could never believe Hanks would do any of these things, but the force of his movie-star personality convinces you that it doesn’t matter. The film is chiefly known for the legendary scene in which Joe yells at right-fielder Evelyn Gardner (Bitty Schram) who then bursts into tears and contemptuous Jimmy announces: “There’s no crying in baseball!” – just to make sure everyone sees her humiliation. In the hands of any other actor, that would be a startling, even shocking scene of dysfunctional abuse. But sprinkled with Hanks stardust, it becomes a piece of hokey homespun wisdom about baseball, albeit brusquely expressed. Later, Jimmy has to give Evelyn another telling-off, but you can see he has supposedly learned his lesson, suppressing his bad temper with a grin. But there was never any real bad temper. The movie powers along with some glorious corn-fed montages about life on the road, going from town to town, match to match, on the bus. And the men, however rough-hewn, are perfect gentlemen. A new version of A League of Their Own might want to acknowledge more explicitly the fact that no African American women were hired, and maybe fictionalise the parallel existence of one or two left out (Davis nods respectfully here at one woman of colour who throws the ball to her with expert accuracy and force.) However, it’s a great piece of Hollywood confectionery, and you might well find yourself choking up a little at the end.

3/10/2022,"Iam in a hotel ballroom in Los Angeles, two floors below street level, the kind of venue I associate with family barmitzvahs and work parties. But I am talking to neither a cousin nor a colleague. Instead, I am talking to Will Smith. So, Will, I say, just about resisting breaking into “In west Philadelphia, born and raised …” Have you been practising your Oscar speech since you were 12? “No, not at all,” he begins, then notices me writing his God-like words in my notebook. “Wait now, this isn’t an interview! We’re just chilling, OK?” OK Will, I say. And so, the Fresh Prince and I chill. Well, for five seconds anyway, until someone else comes along demanding the sunbeam of his attention. Just behind him, Javier Bardem and Penélope Cruz whisper and giggle to one another. Behind them, Benedict Cumberbatch, Andrew Garfield, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Paul Thomas Anderson stand in a cluster, talking intensely. As I walk back to my seat, film producer David Dinerstein comes up to me and asks, “Excuse me, have you seen my director?” I have, as it happens – it’s Questlove, and he’s two tables away from us, sitting next to Denzel Washington. This is the Oscar nominees luncheon, the official moment the Oscars meat machine really grinds into action. The usual reason for the annual lunch is the big photo, in which all the nominees are photographed together, school picture-style. But this year, the Academy has decided that while it’s now safe for more than 200 people to eat lunch next to one another in a basement for four hours, it’s not yet safe for them to pose for a photo together. Instead, this year, they will pose in socially distanced batches of a dozen or so. No one ever came to Hollywood for sensible ideas. Events kick off in what I guess could be described as the foyer, but is really little more than a carpeted corridor next to an underground car park. This is where the nominees mill around before the lunch itself. The first person I spot is Kenneth Branagh, who has three nominations this year (best original screenplay, best director and best picture, all for Belfast), surely making him a super nominee. Is this the least glamorous film event he’s ever been at? “It’s pretty knockabout, isn’t it? And it’s defiantly anti anti-Covid,” he says, looking at all the unmasked people spraying canapés on one another. “But this is a very nice event because there are no prizes, so you can just say ‘hello’ and ‘well done’ to people you admire. Plus, they mix everyone up so you’re sat with so many new people.” Branagh’s last point, about being sat with people from other films, comes up a lot when I talk to the nominees, suggesting, perhaps, an understandable exhaustion some feel by the end of awards season, after travelling around for months with the people from their film. “The first time I came, I was sat with an animator and a makeup artist. It’s eclectic, which I like,” says JK Simmons (best supporting actor nominee for Being the Ricardos.) Not that he’s entirely thrilled about being here this year: “I’m filled with Covid dread, as usual, but other than that it’s delightful,” he says, with a wary look around what could be the biggest celebrity super-spreader event in history. Simmons keeps his mask on for the entire event. Most people bring their partner as their plus one – Maggie Gyllenhaal (best adapted screenplay, The Lost Daughter) is accompanied by Peter Sarsgaard, who somehow actually looks good in a bright yellow suit; young Kodi Smit-McPhee (best supporting actor, The Power of the Dog) grips the hand of his girlfriend, Rebecca Phillipou, looking for all the world as if they were en route to the prom. But Lin-Manuel Miranda (best original song, Encanto) brings his most excellent father, the political strategist, Luis A Miranda Jr. Are the two of them excited about Lin-Manuel’s imminent membership of the EGOT club, for people who have won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony? Lin-Manuel winces: “You say that like it’s a fait accompli! It hasn’t happened yet, but it would be a pretty cool club to join.” I tell him that my Uber driver who drove me to the lunch had We Don’t Talk About Bruno on the stereo, the ubiquitous song he wrote for Encanto. “My kids are really into that song!” he says, looking genuinely astonished.Your kids and everyone else’s, Lin, I say. “And that makes me very happy,” he grins. Any discussion about winning is the one big faux pas at this lunch. For some, it’s because it’s a potential jinx. For others, it’s because, they insist, they’re “just enjoying the ride” (Andrew Garfield, best actor, tick tick… BOOM!) Everyone is, of course, ludicrously overdressed for a Monday lunchtime, and the big trend at this lunch is showing your stomach, as modelled by Kristen Stewart (best actress, Spencer), Coda’s Emilia Jones and Gyllenhaal. Someone who is very much not modelling this trend is Guillermo del Toro (best picture, Nightmare Alley), who is the nominee everyone wants to talk to, and he greets them all with an anti anti-Covid smooch on the cheek. At last, we are ushered into the ballroom, which is filled with circular tables, each with chairs for 10 or so people. Everyone is assigned to a table and Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard are sat with Jessica Chastain (best actress, The Eyes of Tammy Faye), Stewart is sat a stone’s throw away from Billie Eilish (best original Song, No Time to Die). I am seated back to back with Stewart and next to the delightful Bob Morgan (best costume design, Dune) and his partner, Philip Schurer, an actor. This is Morgan’s first nomination and, for the occasion, Schurer accessorised his tux with a pin of the Ukrainian flag. “It was pretty surreal getting ready for this while watching the news. Now here we are, drinking champagne while people are running for their lives,” Morgan says. In fact, we are drinking Coppola chardonnay at this point while waiters bring our three course gluten-free meal. In recent years, the Oscars have felt like an exercise in self-flagellation, with politically charged acceptance speeches far outnumbering the jokes. At first, it looks like this lunch will maintain the tradition when a slide appears on the large screen at the front of the room: “We gather to celebrate your nomination on the ancestral lands of the Tongva people.” But perhaps it’s because the news is so unremittingly terrible, or maybe it’s that the Oscars have been leaching viewers, but someone has decided that people need laughs rather than lectures. So we next get a short satirical film from Saturday Night Live’s Kate McKinnon about how to accept awards, which is far too funny to only be seen by 200-or-so people. Then the Oscars’ very enthusiastic producer, Will Packer, takes to the stage. “[After Covid], we are all survivors. And the people in this room are thrivers,” he says solemnly. “We are part of an industry that makes people feel something. In that sense, you are all essential!” This, unsurprisingly, gets big applause. Academy president David Rubin sums up the mood in his speech, which begins with an announcement that the Academy “voices unconditional support for the people of Ukraine. What a time. OK, welcome to the great tradition of celebrating the Oscars!” he says, and then thanks the 10 zillion sponsors. What a time … but as long as there are advertisers, the show must go on. There are some notable no-shows – most notably, The Lost Daughter’s Olivia Colman and The Power of the Dog’s Jane Campion, Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons. Despite that, when Alfred Molina reads out all the nominees’ names to call them up for the mini group photos, each one getting enthusiastic applause, it takes so long that Stewart turns around to me and asks, massaging her palms, “Don’t your hands hurt?” They do, but I don’t follow her lead in resolving the problem by smacking the backs of my hands together. If one were to predict winners by which nominees get the biggest applause in the room, a betting man would put money on Eilish, Questlove (best documentary feature, Summer of Soul), Aunjanue Ellis (best supporting actress, King Richard) and, most of all, Will Smith (best actor, King Richard).

3/10/2022,"Since 2015, Boris Johnson told an antsy House of Commons at prime minster’s questions, “We’ve done more to resettle vulnerable people than any other European country”. It didn’t make sense, so perhaps it was a mistake. Poland has taken 1.2 million Ukrainian refugees, Hungary has taken 190,000, Germany 50,000. By Tuesday, we’d taken 300. Maybe he didn’t mean Ukrainians, because he hadn’t refreshed his browser? Maybe he meant Syrians, 621,000 of whom were given sanctuary by Germany; 29,000 by the UK. Nope. Or maybe he said it by accident? But then he said it again, and again. Could it have been a straight lie? A dicey move, in parliament. Not exactly: he was referring to the number of people taken in under a resettlement scheme over the past seven years, in which the UK numbers do surpass other nations’. Overall, our figures are absolutely dwarfed by even much smaller neighbours. The same old prime minister arrived in parliament, in other words, with the same old manoeuvre of turning something technically true into an untruth by stripping it of context. But it’s not the same old world any more. When you stand up and deliberately mislead, call the worst the best, turn facts on their head, it all sounds a bit Putin-esque. He had another couple of lines – that he didn’t believe in letting refugees in without checks, and that Conservatives must be humane and have sanctuary in their blood, because look how many on its frontbench were descended from refugees. Those were both weaker, but less murderous-dictator-adjacent. So many members, from so many parties, stood up to challenge Johnson on the UK’s response to the refugee crisis. The SNP’s Ian Blackford gave a persuasive and workmanlike rundown of how far short we were falling. Ed Davey got Johnson on the hop, as he found himself rattling through the UK visa centres in eastern Europe, muffling one city into another in frantic underenunciation. One of the most affecting speakers was from the Tory benches, Julian Smith, whose voice quavered slightly as he asked when his own party was going to show some humanity. Keir Starmer went another way, as they say in casting: the chancellor’s measures on fuel bills were nothing like enough to meet the situation, so “when will the prime minister force the chancellor to U-turn?” It was a peculiar angle, dispersing the fault between Johnson and Sunak, and ham-fistedly obvious about not expecting an answer. But it transpired to be just some fancy footwork before his main attack: BP has made £9.5bn out of prices that were surging even before Ukraine, and Shell made £14bn, “in their own words”, said Starmer, “more money than they know what to do with”. His call for a windfall tax on energy company profits is probably as close to popular radicalism as he’s prepared to sail. Johnson replied that, if you tax these corporations, they will just pass that cost on to the consumer. It was ironic that they had a pointless barney about nuclear power right after (a leader who has built no nuclear power stations, accusing an opponent who’s never been in government of failing to build nuclear power stations). That answer on windfall tax – what’s the point of taxing companies, when the consumer will always pay? – is radioactive for Johnson. It will sound worse and worse, as fuel bills rise. Perhaps it was because he realised this that Johnson started mangling his words, or perhaps in some corner of his limbic brain, he thought that accelerating his speech would make the time go faster. He figured out eventually that it was the other around. Starmer has found a laddish mojo in his responses, all “come off it” and “does he expect us to buy that?” Two questions from Johnson’s backbenchers were downright peculiar. Greg Clark, the MP for Tunbridge Wells, asked if the prime minister would like to join him in wishing a happy birthday to the second world war veteran Colin Bell. Why yes, Boris Johnson would love to do that. His answer was so baggy, his relief so audible, he sounded a breath away from launching into the song. Richard Holden, the MP for North West Durham, wanted to know whether, when his constituency’s new cottage hospital was built, the prime minister would grant him the honour of opening it? It’s nothing new for a backbench chancer in a hurry to lob an asinine question to give some rhetorical respite to a flailing leader, but these were on a whole new level, reaching for desperate patriotic bass notes, promising photo ops and, who knows, maybe a dressing up opportunity, as if dealing with a … well, maybe not an autocrat: but autocrat-adjacent.",News/Politics,Johnson turns truth on head in lines about UK response to Ukraine refugee crisis | Zoe Williams,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/09/johnson-turns-truth-on-head-over-uk-response-to-ukraine-refugee-crisis
3/10/2022,"Manchester City welcome Sporting Clube de Portugal to the Etihad on Wednesday, having won the first leg in Lisbon by five goals to zip, so we’ll not insult your intelligence by giving it the Big Cup big sell. But even if that risible non-event of a tie was teetering on a knife-edge, it still wouldn’t be the game of the day, because over in Madrid, Real Madrid and PSG, two genuine heavyweights with 13 Big Cup titles between them, go head to head for a place in the quarter-finals. You’ve already done the maths, we’ll not belabour the point. PSG’s travails in Big Cup are well documented, so there’s no need to revisit them again. We will, though. They infamously shipped a four-goal first-leg lead against Barcelona, lost a two-goal first-leg advantage against Ole-era Manchester United, for goodness sake, forgot to turn up when they eventually did make it to the final, and have generally been a dependable source of entertainment for neutrals around Europe, the delicious nectar of sweet schadenfreude pumping freely from the pipeline of high amusement, as thick and unctuous and precious as oil. Charge your glasses. Another gush threatened to slick over PSG when good-time charlie Lionel Messi scuffed his penalty in the first leg, but Kylian Mbappé dug him out of a hole by conjuring an injury-time winner out of thin air. There’s still plenty of time and scope for things to go badly wrong again, though, despite the precious 1-0 lead they take to the Bernabéu. Since that first leg, Madrid have won all three of their league matches to the cumulative tune of 8-1, while Mauricio Pochettino’s side have lost two of their subsequent three games, Neymar missing another penalty along the way. All of which suggests an over-reliance on Mbappé to have a good game, else another Big Cup fiasco awaits the French. Pochettino is currently a favourite to be the next Manchester United manager, by the way, but we’ll not belabour that point either. Join Scott Murray from 8pm GMT for hot Big Cup coverage of Real Madrid 3-0 PSG (agg: 3-1), while Barry Glendenning will be on hand for Manchester City 1-0 Sporting (agg: 6-0). “They wanted to take my home in 1990; they took it in 2014; now they want again to take my home, our home. I think this is already too much” – Shakhtar Donetsk director of football Darijo Srna drove out of Kyiv for 36 hours and saw things he’d hoped never to witness again. While that went on, he got his players to safety. Now he’s spoken to Nick Ames. Here’s the latest Football Weekly podcast. “Re: corner kicks (Fiver letters passim). Unlike The Fiver I’m not usually one to drag out an issue that clearly raises hackles in a minority, but while running the line of an Under-11s game my son was playing in, I made a boy on the opposing team retake his corner because the ball wasn’t placed in the quadrant. Now I sleep well at night knowing that at least one scruffy youth in Greasborough is fully aware of the regulations” – John Rigby. “As a journeyman ‘lino’ at various step levels, can I point out that no part of the ball has to be in contact with the outermost edge of the quadrant to be in a valid position, let alone sitting inside it. The required perspective is using imaginary lines looking straight down from above the ball – as long as any part of it obscures the quadrant, the ball’s considered inside. As a sphere, it wouldn’t of course necessarily have to ‘touch’ the line. See, easy, all those shouting dog’s abuse at opposition corner-takers around the grounds can finally wind their necks back in and find a something else to take their anger issues out on. Or support Everton” – Mike Kilner. “Can I add my pet hate, which is goalkeepers kicking from hand when they are a good two or three metres outside their area. It’s bloody handball. Mind you, for those readers who only watch Premier League football, the idea of a goalkeeper kicking the ball from hand is pretty hard to believe. It certainly still happens in the National League” – Dan Levy. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today’s winner of our prizeless letter o’ the day is … Mike Kilner. Colchester chairman Robbie Cowling says the club will donate all gate receipts from Saturday’s League Two game with Forest Green to humanitarian aid efforts in Ukraine. “All I have been able to do so far is watch the news and marvel at the kindness being shown by those people in the countries that neighbour Ukraine, such as Poland, and wonder what can be done to help those refugees,” he said. Mexican authorities have ordered Queretaro to play home matches behind closed doors for a year after fans went on a rampage that – at the very least – left 26 people injured, three critically.

After watching Liverpool get beaten 1-0 by Inter but still qualify for Big Cup’s quarter-finals, Jürgen Klopp has some sage advice for budding young managers. “The art of football is to lose the right games,” he parped. RB Salzburg boss Matthias Jaissle has splashed his face with cold water and reflected on his side’s 7-1 shellacking at Bayern. “It was really horrible,” he gasped. “A few teams have come here and got a battering – and it happened to us.” Luke Shaw is open to extending his Manchester United contract but, in even more surprising news, he is still only 26. Richie Wellens has been given the Leyton Orient job and, presumably, instructions not to take the League Two strugglers down. And Patrick Bamford might be fit enough to play for Leeds in Thursday’s 3-2 defeat by Aston Villa after recovering from foot-knack. Sevilla boss Julen Lopetegui gets his chat on with Sid Lowe about falling for football, his Spain exit and Big Vase hopes before their tie with Taxpayers FC.

3/10/2022,"Ukraine has accused Russian forces of “holding 400,000 people hostage” in the southern port of Mariupol, as fresh efforts to evacuate civilians from devastated cities along safe routes agreed with Moscow made little progress. Ukrainian authorities said corridors should allow residents of Mariupol, Enerhodar, Sumy, Izyum and Volnovakha, as well as towns around Kyiv, to leave. Civilians did manage to leave Sumy for a second day, and some vulnerable people got out of Enerhodar in the north-west, but there was little evidence the corridors were working elsewhere. Concern was rapidly growing over civilians in Mariupol in particular, where hundreds of thousands of residents have been sheltering from Russian shelling and missile attacks for more than a week without water, power or heating. Britain’s Ministry of Defence said fighting continued north-west of Kyiv. The cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol were being heavily shelled and remained encircled by Russian forces. Ukraine said the Chernobyl nuclear plant had been disconnected from the grid and reserve generators only had fuel for 48 hours. On Thursday 24 February, Russia attacked Ukraine along multiple axes, bringing to a calamitous end weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war. Fighting and other military activity took place around and on the way to Kyiv. A substantial attack was aimed at the eastern city of Kharkiv. Russian forces also headed north and east from Crimea. On Friday 25 February, Russian forces reached the outskirts of Kyiv and carried out an amphibious assault from the Sea of Azov near Mariupol. The shape of the Russian incursion became clearer: On Saturday 26 February, Russian forces in control of territory to the north-west of Kyiv continued their assault on the capital. Elsewhere, heavy fighting was reported in and around Kharkiv and there were Ukrainian counterattacks in some places previously claimed by Russian forces. On Monday 28 February, Russian rocket attacks killed dozens of people in Kharkiv. Pre-dawn blasts were heard again in Kyiv and in Mariupol, which was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack. On Tuesday 1 March, Russian forces bombarded the government headquarters in Kharkiv, and the armoured column continued rolling towards the capital. On Wednesday 2 March, Moscow’s forces took the port and train station in the strategically important city of Kherson, on the Black Sea. Russian paratroopers landed in Kharkiv overnight, after several days of fierce bombardment that killed or wounded dozens of civilians. Kyiv came under more heavy shelling as Russian forces stepped up their offensive and moved closer towards the capital in an apparent attempt to encircle it. A week into the Russian invasion, on Thursday 3 March, the Black Sea port of Kherson became the first major Ukrainian target to fall under the de facto control of Moscow’s forces. On Friday 4 March the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was seized by Russian military forces after a fire sparked by overnight shelling burned for several hours at the largest facility of its kind in Europe. On Saturday 5 March a deal to evacuate civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol and the nearby town of Volnovakha collapsed, and residents in occupied Kherson and Melitopol took part in anti-Russia demonstrations. On Sunday 6 March civilians came under fire as they tried to leave areas including Irpin, where a young family was killed. On Monday 7 March Ukraine dismissed as immoral and unacceptable Russian proposals to evacuate civilians along routes into Russia or Belarus. On Tuesday 8 March civilians left Sumy and Irpin in the north, and Russia was accused of violating a ceasefire by shelling a proposed humanitarian corridor from besieged Mariupol. Over the previous few months Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Vladimir Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/russia-war-ukraine-complete-guide-maps-video-and-pictures
3/10/2022,"In the autumn of 1972, I had just finished filming A Warm December with Sidney Poitier. I was in New York at a party hosted by Island Records, and that’s where I first met Bob. He and the Wailers had recently signed with the label and he was in the city for promotional work. I was at a stage in my life where I was fed up of repeating other people’s ideas and voices as an actress. I wanted to find another way to express myself. I had been learning the craft of photography through my friend Francine Winham, and I decided to put aside my acting career to document Bob Marley and the Wailers for their forthcoming album Catch a Fire. My then partner, Chris Blackwell – co-founder of Island – asked me to guide the group and help transform them into international artists. I travelled with Bob to Trinidad and Tobago and Haiti soon afterwards. We began to develop a very close relationship that involved us writing together, including the lyrics for Get Up, Stand Up. He was serious about being an artist, and was desperate to get his voice out to the world. When we got back to Jamaica, I suggested that we go to Hellshire Beach for the shoot. It’s a part of the island famed for its beautiful white sands, clear water and the Blue Mountain in the backdrop. I wanted to show Bob as himself, a young artist coming out of Jamaica, on his own terms. It was paramount to demonstrate how important Rastafarian philosophy and its way of life was to him. I knew that Bob’s Covenant, as he called his “Rasta tam” (his cap of red, gold and green), was the connection. I sought to show that without the Rastafari tradition there was no Bob Marley. Back then, Rastafari was not considered part of Jamaican culture, and people on the island were disenfranchised and ostracised for being Rastafarians. Having dreadlocks often prevented access to white collar jobs. I wanted Bob Marley and the Wailers to be a catalyst for a change in the perception of Rastafarians both in Jamaica and worldwide, and to associate the tradition with the beauty of reggae. On the day of the shoot, Bob had had a disagreement with Chris and was in a bad mood. To loosen him up, I got him to run on the beach. He got very warm so he took his shirt off. All the while he was jogging, feeling free, I was getting shots of him. I wanted to photograph him in the light of Jamaica, showing the colour of our skin the way it should be shown. I remember him saying: “Gosh, you’re taking many pictures of me!” The camera loved him and he loved to show off – he photographed like a dream. By the time he stopped running, the evening sun had fallen and reflected like burnt gold on the surface of the water. I went in for a closeup, and that’s when he clasped his hands. To me, the photo is like a prayer, as if Bob was saying: “I am looking out at Babylon and I trust you.” The pose was completely natural, but I knew as soon as he did it that here lay the decisive moment. I used a Nikon with a 200mm lens. I adore the grainy quality that it gives a photo – I particularly dislike pictures to be completely flat. The image depicts the very essence of being comfortable in one’s own skin, and how self-expression is born out of being true to self.
