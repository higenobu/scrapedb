12/28/2021,"The DJ Janice Long, who has died aged 66 following a short illness, became a pioneer in broadcasting as the first woman to have her own weekday show on BBC Radio 1 and the first to become a regular presenter of Top of the Pops. Unlike some of the prominent DJs with whom she shared the airwaves during the first part of her career in the 1980s, Long was a genuine music fan, credited with giving a helping hand to a number of artists whom she had championed, including Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Primal Scream, Manic Street Preachers, the Teardrop Explodes, Amy Winehouse and the Coral.  She continued to promote new talent after she had left Radio 1 and Top of the Pops in the late 80s, hosting a long-running breakfast show on Radio 2, from 2000, and working for a variety of other stations, including Radio 6 Music, XFM and her own co-creation, the Liverpool station Crash FM. Until her death she was broadcasting four nights a week on BBC Radio Wales, as well as on Saturday afternoons on Greatest Hits Radio. Long was born in Liverpool to Margaret (nee Wells) and Colin Chegwin, who encouraged their three children to pursue their interests in stage performance. Keith became a TV presenter and his twin brother, Jeff, went into music promotion. In her teenage years Janice was a member of the Merseyside Youth Drama company, but she began her working life as cabin crew for Laker Airways, followed by stints as a shopworker, insurance clerk and in telesales before marrying Trevor Long in 1977 and moving into broadcasting as a station assistant at BBC Radio Merseyside two years later. Soon she was presenting a Sunday evening show, Streetlife, taking a weekly look at the post-punk scene in Liverpool, and in that role she helped Frankie Goes to Hollywood gain wider attention by offering them their first radio appearance. Long was quickly upgraded to her own afternoon show and it was there that she did an interview with the Radio 1 DJ Paul Gambaccini, who was so impressed by her style and knowledge that he recommended her to his bosses. As a result she joined Radio 1 in late 1982 with a Saturday evening show, and within two years was occupying a much higher profile Monday to Thursday evening slot with the Janice Long programme, on which she presented a mix of new music, interviews and live studio sessions. Radio 1 had been a bastion of the male DJ from its launch in 1967, and although Annie Nightingale had featured on its airwaves since 1970 with a Sunday evening programme, Long’s promotion to a regular midweek berth was groundbreaking. Warm, witty and good company – on radio as in life – she aligned herself more to the studious interest of John Peel and David “Kid” Jensen than the happy-go-lucky “Smashie and Nicey” DJ mainstream. She was often paired with either Peel or Jensen on Top of the Pops, and appeared on the programme more than 60 times as the sole female presenter, paving the way for Jackie Brambles, Anthea Turner, Fearne Cotton and Jayne Middlemiss to come in later. In 1985 she was also chosen as one of the main presenters of the BBC’s coverage of the huge Live Aid concert at Wembley. Long’s successful six-year spell on Radio 1 and Top of the Pops ended in 1988, when she took time off to have a child with her partner, Paul Berry (whom she married in 2017), after a divorce from Trevor in 1982. As was common at the time, no one offered her a way to return. Instead, in 1989 Long moved on to Greater London Radio (now BBC Radio London), where she presented the daily breakfast show before switching to the weekends. While maintaining her presence there she also took on occasional shows for what was then BBC Radio 5 and established an early behind the scenes connection with one of the new batch of commercial radio stations, the indie-focused XFM. By 1995 she had gone back to Liverpool to set up an alternative rock and dance station, Crash FM (later Juice FM and now Capital Liverpool) with backing, among others, from Bob Geldof and Boy George. Although she did some presenting work for the station, once it was properly established she returned to the BBC, where from 1999 she presented a three-hour Saturday afternoon show for Radio 2, moving on to become a longstanding weekday breakfast presenter the following year. While there she also appeared for two years on BBC Radio 6 Music from its launch in 2002, hosting its Dream Ticket programme of new music and studio sessions. Long was with Radio 2 for 18 years in all, although after almost a decade she was shunted into the post-midnight slot and she eventually left in 2017 to present her own Monday to Thursday evening show on BBC Radio Wales. From 2020 onwards she also fitted in a Saturday afternoon programme on Greatest Hits Radio. Aside from her prolific radio work, Long also featured on a number of light TV programmes over the years, including game shows, and in 2006 she was called back to co-present the final episode of Top of the Pops after it was decided to bring it to an end. In 2018 she received an honorary doctorate from Edge Hill University in recognition of her commitment to music, and the same year was featured in the Royal College of Art’s First Women UK exhibition, celebrating 100 pioneering 21st century British females. She was also a patron of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts. Long is survived by Paul, their daughter, Blue, and son, Fred, her father and her brother, Jeff. Keith died in 2017.

12/28/2021,"Tributes were paid to Sarah Weddington after the attorney who argued and won the landmark Roe v Wade case at the supreme court, establishing the right to abortion, died aged 76.  Susan Hays, a former student of Weddington’s and a Democratic candidate for Texas agriculture commissioner, announced on Twitter that Weddington died on Sunday morning “after a series of health issues”. Alexis McGill Johnson, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood, the largest US provider of reproductive services including abortions, tweeted: “What a loss. What a tremendous legacy. “Planned Parenthood will continue to honor Sarah Weddington’s work every day – by keeping up the fight to ensure that everyone has access to abortion.” Steve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, from which Weddington graduated, wrote: “Sarah Weddington was 26 (!) when she first argued Roe before [the supreme court] in December 1971, just over three years after graduating. “A remarkable woman, a remarkable career, and a remarkable life. May her memory be a blessing.” Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg, of the National Council of Jewish Women, tweeted: “May her memory be a blessing that lights our way in our fight for abortion access and equity for all.” Julián Castro, a Texas politician who was housing secretary under Barack Obama and ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, wrote: “Sarah Weddington was a proud Texan who led the charge to protect reproductive rights under Roe v Wade. “She leaves behind an incredible legacy – one we must defend now more than ever.” He was referring to growing threats to Roe v Wade, including the Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization case, heard at the supreme court earlier this month, which could weaken provisions of the landmark ruling. Colin Allred, a civil rights attorney and Democratic congressman for Texas’s 32nd district, touched on the supreme court’s decision to uphold a Texas abortion law, the most extreme in the US to date, which bans abortions at six weeks and does not make exceptions for invest and rape. “Texas was home to Sarah Weddington who argued Roe, which no longer exists here,” Allred wrote. “Our history provides hope for our future. We must keep fighting for a better Texas.” Celia Israel, a Democratic member of the Texas state legislature, tweeted about studying under Weddington at the University of Texas, Austin. “It was always hard to just call her ‘Sarah’,” Israel wrote. “She commanded respect … she taught a leadership class, held me to high standards and encouraged me to get involved and make my mark. “As is the case with teachers and leaders we look up to, we are their legacy.” In an interview with the Guardian in 2017, Weddington predicted: “Whatever else I do in my life, the headline on my obituary is always going to be ‘Roe v Wade attorney dies’.” She was at peace with that, she said. “I think most women of my generation can recall our feelings about the fight,” she said. “It’s like young love. You may not feel exactly the same, but you remember it.”",News/US news,Sarah Weddington: tributes paid to lawyer who argued and won Roe v Wade,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/27/sarah-weddington-lawyer-roe-v-wade-abortion
12/28/2021,"Years ago I collected my new prescription glasses and walked home staring up like a person who had time-travelled from a pre-aeroplane era: I had no idea trees had individual leaves that could be seen from the ground. Before 2020, I had never noticed gardens, either: they were things that old people liked and neighbourhood dads mowed constantly. The garden attached to my flat became interesting only if a fox was standing in it. Then lockdown happened, and the people who usually kept the vines and trees from eating the building stopped coming. I tried to sort it out myself, pathetically Googling to figure out what was supposed to be there and what was an alien plant invasion. Somehow, I ended up watching Gardeners’ World. I can’t remember the first episode I saw, nor the first time I heard Monty Don talk about elephant garlic. I’d never heard of a “sweet pea” outside of Popeye cartoons, but I remember Monty telling us that their fragrance was intoxicating. I learned that flowers that looked like living spirographs were called dahlias and that tulips and daffodils, the welcome sights of spring and harbingers of warmth, only come alive if they’ve been left out in the cold all winter.  Over the year, my interest, well, grew. My boyfriend gave me Monty Don’s back catalogue of books for my birthday, including one from the 90s where he’s still going by Montagu. Very soon I became entirely unavailable on Friday nights, mentally or physically; if Monty was in the pond with his waders on, even the cat was ignored. Whatever horrors were happening in the news, the birds were chirping at Longmeadow and Monty was there among them, a calming presence when everything else was on fire. “The BBC made a decision to carry on filming Gardeners’ World, and I always see it rather like wartime,” says Monty, when I call to tell him about the creepy shrine I have erected in his honour (I’m joking. I would never tell him). “They had to entertain the troops. So I was the Vera Lynn of Covid.” There’s a pause and he laughs. “I’m going to regret saying that.” At Longmeadow, where Gardeners’ World is filmed, the BBC installed five miles of cabling and blocked the drive with four metal containers that served as isolation pods for the cameraman, the sound recordist, the director and the electrician. It stayed like that until July 2021. Monty was alone in his garden – Vera Lynn with a walkie-talkie, remote-controlled cameras and an invisible audience. “I really didn’t enjoy filming during lockdown; there was no fun. When you’re filming with a crew it becomes a collaborative, creative process. But I felt, in a quite old-fashioned way, that I was doing my bit.” I ask what got him through the year if he couldn’t watch Gardeners’ World like the rest of us. “I lapped up Succession. I’ve seen the first two seasons twice.” When the first lockdown began, I didn’t know that for the next 18 months I would think of little else but the garden, that I would one day be a person with a preorder for spring bulbs. I am, statistically speaking, not unusual: my newfound interest stands alongside banana bread and sourdough as one of the great pandemic cliches. According to the HTA (Horticultural Trades Association) Garden Retail Monitor, garden centres at one point reported a rise in sales of 34% compared with pre-pandemic times, and they are still trading at 25% higher than in 2019. Gardeners’ World itself had an influx of new viewers. “I don’t think it came out of nowhere,” says Monty of the surge in interest. “This has been a slow burn; circumstance suddenly gave it a flowering. Over the last five years or so there has been a growing movement in people who are interested. It’s the interface with the natural world that most people have.” At last count, 88% of people in the UK had some kind of access to a garden or an outside space. But prior to the pandemic, many regarded their garden as a bind, something else to be kept tidy. “They didn’t see it as a creative opportunity. I think that that’s what lockdown did,” he says. “It opened up the possibilities of a garden.” Lockdown also opened up the possibilities of what the BBC would broadcast: Monty put out a call for viewers to send in videos of their own gardens – to fill the spaces in the programme where presenters would ordinarily go farther afield. They received 10,000 videos in the first year. Although they still included three an episode right through 2021’s series, the majority have never been shown. The videos are a fascinating, uplifting, sometimes heartbreaking glimpse into people’s shrunken lives. There was the woman in Warsaw who had filled her tiny fourth-floor balcony until you couldn’t see the walls, but had left a window for her dog to look out of, like a mouse-door in the skirting board. There was the 84-year-old woman talking about how for the first time she was starting a garden while being conscious of her own mortality; she wanted mature trees because she didn’t believe she had time to wait and watch them grow. And there were the doctors and nurses on a Covid ward who had discovered that the stuffy environment of the hospital office created the perfect conditions for cultivating the kind of vegetables they remembered from growing up in the Philippines. They had Chinese bitter gourds trained up against the windows, ripening in the sun. “I think what’s come through from all those is people just sharing pleasure,” says Monty. His own favourites include a 90-year-old woman who “didn’t quite say it, but she meant: ‘Fuck it, I’m going to do what I want,’” and the infectious joy of the sisters with Down’s syndrome who wrote him a poem. “You can gloss over them and call them simple pleasures, but they’re not: they’re really deep, rich pleasures, and they’re intensely complicated because they strike so close to where true happiness is.” When Gardeners’ World finished for the year last autumn, I was bereft. I watched old episodes and pretended it was spring. I stared out my window and willed the daffodils to grow. All I wanted was a one-off special where Monty wore a big jumper and showed us his houseplants. I couldn’t handle the fact that the light that had seen me through the horrors of the pandemic was going out, just as the clocks changed and the world got darker. This year, when I watched Monty fill pots with tulip bulbs and prepare the garden for another winter, the only thing that grew was the feeling of dread in my stomach. He was going to go away again. “I don’t think the schedulers really understand gardens, gardening, or the audience,” he says. “They see it as: ‘Well, the season’s over, it’s October and it’s wintry. Obviously no one’s interested in gardening in winter, so therefore we don’t put gardening out.’ What they don’t realise is they are gardeners. Gardening doesn’t leave their life just because Gardeners’ World goes off air, any more than food leaves people’s lives because Bake Off finishes a run.” The loss was obviously not felt by me alone. This year, the BBC is putting out winter specials – something it hasn’t done in a decade. The world is more interesting thanks to Monty. I tell him I can name plants in gardens as I pass them, that I can make an educated guess as to how much tender care goes into their lives. I know that trees are sharing food and possibly spreading information through their root systems to alert others to disease or danger – and now that I know all of this is happening beneath my feet and far above my head, I won’t ever forget. As the poet Mary Oliver wrote: “Attention is the beginning of devotion.” “Ah,” he says, chuckling. “Now you’re the smartarse who knows.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"The person who got me through 2021: Monty Don inspired my new, obsessive love of gardening",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/27/the-person-who-got-me-through-2021-monty-don-inspired-my-new-obsessive-love-of-gardening
12/28/2021,"Their classroom has no roof, no seats, no desks; most of the 50 small children sitting on the rubble-strewn floor have no pens or paper. But the students in this makeshift school in Hays, a village in Yemen’s Hodeidah province, are still among the luckiest in the country simply for having a teacher and a place to learn. Seven years into a catastrophic war that sparked the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, Yemen’s conflict shows no signs of ending soon, and the future of an entire generation is at risk of being destroyed. About 3 million children are unable to attend school, according to the Red Cross, with 8.1 million needing urgent educational assistance.  “There is a huge pressure to leave school to work to support the family,” says Yemeni Agence France-Presse photographer, Khaled Ziad, who took the picture in September. “Some children in Yemen are now 10 years old and they’ve never had the chance to enrol in any school. If families don’t have money for food or medicine and hospital fees, how can they afford education expenses?” The UN has yet to make an official declaration of famine in Yemen because there is not enough reliable data to meet the technical definition. But 16.2 million people – around half the population – are food insecure, and fluctuating pockets of famine-like conditions have left nearly 2.3 million children under the age of five acutely malnourished. Weakened immune systems also make infants susceptible to Yemen’s devastating outbreaks of cholera and dengue fever: most people say Covid-19 is the least of their concerns. Yemeni childhoods are ending earlier and earlier. The average age of marriage for girls in some rural areas was just 14, even before the conflict broke out, and has only dropped since, while boys as young as 11 are recruited to fight by parties on all sides of the complex conflict. Most of the children getting basic literacy and numeracy lessons in Hays had already been displaced from other areas, Ziad says, as families attempt to flee the fighting between the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, who control most of the region, and the Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition fighting to restore Yemen’s internationally-recognised government. According to Unicef, the warring parties have attacked schools at least 231 times since March 2015, when the coalition intervened. In 2018, a coalition airstrike dropped a US-made missile on a school bus of boys in the Houthi heartland of Saada, killing 44. “Students do not feel safe while they get lessons. They can’t afford supplies. Schools are destroyed, homes are destroyed … years go by, and there is still no chance to get a proper education,” Ziad says. Civil servant salaries in some areas have not been paid in several years, meaning many teachers and doctors effectively continue to work for free. While Yemen has about 170,000 teachers across primary and secondary schools, about two-thirds do not receive regular salaries. “The teachers say that, even though they don’t have salaries and the conditions are harsh, they feel there is a responsibility to keep working. If they leave education, they know the disaster would be even greater,” Ziad says. “They continue to perform an important duty.” Ziad, who lives in the nearby city of Hodeidah, says that he hopes his work as a photographer will help the world understand Yemen’s tragedy. He worries constantly about what the future holds for his two-year-old son. “If the war continues, I do not think that my child or the rest of the children in Hodeidah will be able to have a better future. It has to end,” he says.

12/28/2021,"Jimmy Anderson walked into the indoor nets at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and slumped into the first available chair. His eyes were weary. His boots were scuffed. His trousers were soaked in blood, a fielding injury from Adelaide two Tests earlier which had never been allowed to heal. The fourth Ashes Test of 2017-18 had just ended in an excruciating draw, Anderson had just bowled 59 thankless overs and only a lunatic would have entertained the notion that he would be back at this very ground in four years’ time for more of the same.  A lunatic such as Jimmy Anderson, in other words. For in the last week of 2021, here he was: a fresh set of whites, a fresh set of stumps, a fresh set of edges, a fresh haul of victims. And even if England’s latest batting collapse extinguished any faint hope that his four for 33 might prove an Ashes-saving effort, then in many ways this is to capture the very essence of late-career Anderson: a bowler steadily getting better and better, even as his team gets worse and worse. Certainly it looks less enjoyable than it once did. Anderson with the ball in his hand always had a certain sullenness to him, the knack of making professional sport look like hard labour. But something has changed, too. The catches go down with increasing frequency. So too the amount of time he gets to spend in the dressing room putting his feet up. And whereas peak Anderson was once one of the primary attacking weapons in the game, for the last few years he has been more often deployed in defence: chasing lost causes, bailing out failing batters. And so to watch Anderson these days is a curiously draining experience. The wickets are met with a snarl, the plays-and-misses with a grimace. There was a moment on the second evening when Jonny Bairstow ran round from deep midwicket to save a second run, but made the mistake of returning the ball on the half-volley instead of on the bounce. Anderson was still glaring at him a full 10 seconds later. The scars of battle may be largely psychological, but still visible for that. This will be his 60th Test defeat. Only Brian Lara and Shivnarine Chanderpaul have lost more. Only Allan Border and Kim Hughes – both Australians, you will note – will have lost more Tests in Australia. Only Muttiah Muralitharan and Courtney Walsh have taken more wickets in defeat. If we accept the modern pro’s maxim that personal accomplishments are largely irrelevant and only team success matters, then it turns out Anderson has done a lot of running and bowling and glowering and bleeding in a pointless cause. What, then, was the point? Perhaps, at heart, it really is just a numbers game. Not milestones or statistics – Anderson never paid much heed to those – but the singular, fiscal pursuit of the highest number of wickets for the fewest possible runs. Some of his recent analyses – 23-10-33-4, 10-6-8-1 – have an antediluvian, black-and-white feel to them. You need to go back 24 innings to find the last time he went at more than three runs an over. Anderson is 39 now, and no longer the sort of bowler who runs through a team or blazes his way through an entire summer. It is more than three years since he played a full five-Test series. His moments are rarer now. But when conditions are good and the ball is doing a bit, there are still few bowlers you would rather watch. The Lord’s Test against India was one such occasion. Now, on an unseasonably green MCG wicket, he stepped up again. The dangerous Steve Smith was dismissed with barely a flicker of resistance. Marcus Harris was bewitched and tortured from around the wicket before inevitably offering up a catch to slip. And though Pat Cummins tried to cut loose against the second new ball, Anderson ended up getting him too: a rare short delivery that Cummins could only skew to point. But of course, Anderson can only do it in England. Never mind that he now averages fractionally better (a shade over 33) in away Ashes Tests than he does at home. Or that he averages 12 in away Tests this decade. But the caricature of Anderson as a green-wicket phenomenon remains a stubbornly persistent myth, even within his own camp. Certainly you suspect it contributed to his omission in Brisbane and subsequent rustiness in Adelaide. By the time Anderson was finally up to speed, the Ashes had all but gone. After play, Anderson was asked if he was enjoying the tour. “I’ve got the opportunity to put an England shirt on,” he replied, and you realised that for all the pain, for all the bubbles, for all the despair and the defeat, none of this has been in vain. As the Covid scare in the England camp illustrated, Test cricket itself feels like an exceptionally fragile gift at the moment, and more fragile still in the hands of a 39-year-old fast bowler who may have only another two or three tours of Australia in him. The feel of a new ball in his fingers; the thrill of a plan in fruition; the blood on his trousers at the end of a long hard day; for Anderson, cricket itself was the point all along.",Sport/Sport,Late-career Jimmy Anderson chasing lost causes in failing England team | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/27/late-career-jimmy-anderson-chasing-lost-causes-in-failing-england-cricket-australia-ashes
12/28/2021,"Shishkin made his long-awaited reappearance at Kempton a winning one on Monday with a decisive runaway victory over Greaneteen in the Desert Orchid Chase. The winner travelled comfortably in third in the four-stong field for a good deal of the contest before the turn from home when he was encouraged to take closer order. The hot favourite skipped clear over the last two fences for a smooth success.  Victorious rider Nico de Boinville said: “That was pretty phenomenal from him. We’ve had our struggles [in the build-up the the race] and he took a good blow going into the last, but his class shone through.” A rare winner for Britain at the Cheltenham Festival in March when a 12-length scorer in the Arkle Trophy, he backed that up at Aintree in April. He had not been seen since, with plans to run in the Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown in early December controversially shelved as trainer Nicly Henderson felt he was not getting the right signs, the Joe Donnelly-owned gelding subsequently scoping dirty. Edwardstone ran out a most impressive winner of the Wayward Lad Novice Chase on the card, cementing his position in the betting for the Arkle Trophy at Cheltenham in March. Coral cut the seven-year-old to 9-2 from 6-1 for the Arkle and make him their second-favourite behind the Willie Mullins-trained Ferny Hollow (6-4). Winning trainer Alan King said: “It’s exciting. It’s going back to the old days when we had Voy Por Ustedes and My Way De Solzen. We haven’t had one as good as this for a bit. “The Arkle is his only target [at Cheltenham] - it will be the Arkle or nowhere. A break, the Kingmaker [Chase at warwick] and then if that goes well, hopefully the Arkle. I’m just relived we’ve got today out of the way.” ⭐️ Shishkin - a winning return at @kemptonparkrace for @sevenbarrows & @NdeBoinville🏇 11 races🥇 10 wins🏆 G1 Arkle🏆 G1 Maghull Novices' Chase🏆 G1 Supreme Novices' Hurdle🏆 G2 Desert Orchid Chase✅ Unbeaten over fences👊 Good to see you champ pic.twitter.com/8ahdYae1BL Iceo made an impressive British debut for trainer Paul Nicholls in the opener at Kempton, the Introductory Juvenile Hurdle, beating Rewired by 17 lengths in the hands of Bryony Frost. However, it is far from certain that the winner will tackle the Triumph Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival. Nicholls said: “I wasn’t sure what to expect, to be honest. Although he’d won, and I was very taken by the way he’d won previously in France, he had been very keen at home and we’d just been trying to get him to relax and get him fit and jumping well, so what he did out there today was going to show us really. Betfair cut the winner to 16-1 from 50-1 for the Triumph Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival, but Nicholls warned: “For a horse like him the Triumph Hurdle is not necessarily the be all and end all. “He’s a National Hunt horse of the future. If the Triumph Hurdle came up testing ground then you might look at it, but there’ll be nice races for him along the way and ultimately he’s a chaser of the future. “We’re not too worried about Triumph Hurdles at the moment, unless he proves differently.” Earlier, Chacun Pour Soi was understood to have sustained the equivalent of a hamstring injury after pulling out of his stable lame on Monday morning and missing his expected clash with Envoi Allen in the Grade One Paddy’s Rewards Club Chase at Leopardstown. The gelding was last seen running poorly when last of five in the Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown in early December but prior to that he was an impressive winner of the Champion Chase at Punchestown in April. “It’s a hamstring, that’s basically it but there might be more to it,” Mullins reported. “I said to my vet to give it to me in layman’s terms and he said it was a hamstring, so we’ll have to see how long it takes.” Mullins’ son Patrick, who rode the horse at Sandown, said: “He was lame this morning so we’re going to have to do a little more investigation to find out what it is, hopefully it’s not too bad.” The odds-on shot Envoi Allen won the contest but not after being made to fight by Battleoverdoyen before gaining victory, with the latter looking to be going best before the last fence until the winner kicked away in the closing stages to prevail by a workmanlike seven and a half lengths. “We had a bit of a scare turning in, but he put his head down and galloped to the line,” winning jockey Rachael Blackmore said. “I think Henry was right to step him back [in trip]. Obviously with Chacun Pour Soi being out it changed the dynamic of the race, but it’s great to get his head in front. He felt good today, they can only beat what they are up against I suppose and I’m happy with him.” Bookmakers were generally unimpressed with the manner of victory, pushing the Cheveley Park Stud-owned winner out in the betting for both the Ryanair Chase and Champion Chase at Cheltenham in March.",Sport/Sport,Shishkin ‘phenomenal’ as chaser eases to victory on Kempton comeback,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/27/shishkin-phenomenal-as-chaser-eases-to-victory-on-kempton-comeback-welsh-grand-national-horse-racing
