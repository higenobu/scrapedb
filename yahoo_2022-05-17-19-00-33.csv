5/17/2022,"Last week S&P 500, Dow Jones, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 all broke below the major support and dropped sharply into an oversold condition. This sharp move was anticipated just right before it happened based on the bear market leading indicator as I discussed in the video at the bottom of the post. On Friday all the 4 indices had a strong rebound off the oversold condition. This is significant not because of the magnitude of the rally, but the market breadth because the difference between the number of stocks hit 52 Weeks High and 52 Weeks Low spiked from -1600 to -160. This is a sharp turn from a very bearish market breadth to almost neutral as majority of the stocks participated the reversal. Refer to the market breadth chart below: From the chart above, the spike of the market breadth after 24 January 2022 and 24 February 2022 (circled in orange) corresponded to a swing low in S&P 500. A market rally can be expected based on the current market breadth. Next, we need to determine the quality of the potential rally to anticipate how far it can go. Let’s apply the Wyckoff method to find out if this is likely a stock market bottom or a bull trap by focusing on the price action and the volume. Refer to the chart of S&P 500 Futures below: The bearish bias of S&P 500 was formed after the selloff happened in January 2022. Subsequently, a Wyckoff re-distribution pattern was formed (as highlighted in orange). After the upthrust after distribution (annotated as UTAD), the rallies were of poor quality and the down swings were impulsive and volatile with increasing of supply. These are the key characteristics of a bear market leading to a sign of weakness (annotated as SOW). The confirmation of the strong down swing was identified after the weak rally on 18 April 2022 (annotated as LPSY 0) where I explained in detail about the bearish signal detected from the Wyckoff distribution pattern in the video. Last week S&P 500 broke below the major support at 4100 followed by a sharp move down below 3900 within 4 days, which marked a sign of weakness from the re-distribution structure. Despite the sharp move down, climatic price action and volume did not show up, suggested pending institution capitulation. This is a key difference when comparing to the selling climax low formed on 24 January 2022. There was presence of demand on last Thursday as reflected on the demand tail and the slight increase of volume while the price hit the oversold of the down channel. This was confirmed by Friday’s price action. This is likely the relief rally to test the axis line near 4050-4100 where the support-turned-resistance. The resistance zone coincides with the supply line of the down channel, which could potentially form the last point of supply (annotated as LPSY 2) where the supply will be attracted for institutions to sell into strength (as annotated in green arrow) followed by lower price target at 3600 (and lower). This could be similar to the bear market in 2008 from the price structure to the market rotation sequence as discussed in the video 2 weeks ago. As mentioned earlier, watch the video below find out how to use this leading indicator in the bear market as early warning before the sharp move happened last week (and beyond) in S&P 500. Based on the characteristics of the price action and volume, selling into strength to avoid bull trap is a better bet. Under a more bullish scenario where the current rally is strong enough to test 4200, a trading range could be anticipated rather than a continuation of the selloff to test 3600 in the short-term.

5/17/2022,"Don't miss CoinDesk's Consensus 2022, the must-attend crypto & blockchain festival experience of the year in Austin, TX this June 9-12. A key narrative in the crypto world in 2021 was the arrival of institutional investors to the space. Tesla (TSLA) bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin (BTC) and Wall Street banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS), as well as hedge funds, started allocating client assets to bitcoin that year. Not only were these institutional investors a sign of growing mainstream acceptance, they also appeared to drive up prices. Crypto boomed with the sector’s market capitalization growing 185% that year. Now, as the crypto market's latest swoon wipes off $1.25 trillion from the industry's all-time high market capitalization reached late last year, the question has risen: What role is institutional money playing in the crash? Or to put it more bluntly, are institutional investors making things worse? One thing we know: The crypto market is increasingly correlated to the stock market, and institutional investors appear to have heightened that correlation. And when the stock market goes down, it takes crypto with it. “The influx of institutional interest in BTC, which started to pick up in early 2020 with public declarations of interest from stalwarts of traditional investing, such as Paul Tudor Jones and Renaissance Technologies, coincides with a sustained jump in the 60-day correlation between BTC and the S&P 500,” according to an April 2022 report by Genesis Trading. (Genesis is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.) The three-month correlation between bitcoin and ether (ETH) and the major U.S. stock indexes reached a record high last week, according to Dow Jones Market Data. For bitcoin bulls, the nettlesome takeaway is that the recent crypto crash can't be delinked from the downturn in traditional markets. Stocks are now in a bear market after the Federal Reserve’s latest rate hike of 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage point, at its latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in May. Both crypto and traditional markets briefly skyrocketed after Fed Chair Jerome Powell ruled out a larger increase than that at upcoming meetings, but they quickly reversed course after what Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Market Intelligence, called a “reality check.” The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both dropped nearly 5% the day after the meeting on May 4. Bitcoin fell over 10%, now down over 35% year to date. For market watchers, the upshot was how closely they're traveling in tandem. A recent report from Morgan Stanley found that institutional investors dominated trades in crypto in 2021, and that retail investors accounted for only a third of all trades on crypto exchange Coinbase, reported the Financial Times. “Client interest [is] concentrated more heavily onto the two main crypto assets, BTC and ETH,” analysts at data provider VandaTrack wrote, according to the newspaper. ETH stands for ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. ”This matters because, as more institutions await the first results of the White House executive order on crypto regulation and the ETH merge to ETH 2.0, current price behavior will continue to be driven by TradFi assets.” (ETH 2.0 is shorthand for a planned upgrade of the Ethereum network, and ""TradFi"" is crypto-industry jargon for ""traditional finance."" The old world, as it were.) “We think the increased involvement of institutions, which are sensitive to availability of capital and therefore interest rates, has contributed in part to the high correlation between bitcoin and equities,” the report stated. So does that mean that those institutional investors who helped crypto to flourish a year ago are now a factor in the crash? “Absolutely,” said Bob Iaccino, chief strategist at Path Trading Partners and co-portfolio manager at Stock Think Tank. “We could make such an assumption, since the market has matured and a larger portion of participants are institutions, exposed to both crypto and traditional assets,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital. “With time, it is plausible that we see faster tops and bottoms in the crypto space compared to the prolonged periods in the past.” “This is the nature of tradable assets,” he said. “When assets are sold, all assets are sold. Bitcoin has correlated with the Nasdaq for quite a while now. This is no exception.” It isn't easy to separate institutional and retail inflows and outflows. But sometimes you hear from the investors themselves. Miller Value Partners Chairman Bill Miller, known for beating the S&P 500 Index for 15 consecutive years, sold some of his bitcoin to meet margin calls, noting that when things get tough you want to sell very liquid assets – in this case bitcoin. Take a look at the “Coinbase premium,” which is the difference between the price of buying bitcoin with dollars on Coinbase and the cost of buying bitcoin on Binance using the stablecoin USDT. Crypto-market analysts look at this figure to evaluate who is the bigger force in the market at any given moment – institutional investors or retail investors. The thinking is that Coinbase's user base skews more institutional than Binance's. So if there's a premium, it usually means that institutional investors are leading the market higher. But recently, the premium flipped negative and fell to a 12-month low, according to data from CryptoQuant. “Usually, there is a Coinbase premium. This means that the bitcoin price on Coinbase is higher than on Binance. This was/is very important, because American institutions and HNW (High Net Worth) were trading mostly on Coinbase. However... in the latest few days it’s negative. This indicates heavy selling on Coinbase Pro!” CryptoQuant said in a blog post.  “The crypto investor from retail to institutional tend to also be the investor in tech stocks,” said Howard Greenberg, cryptocurrency educator at Prosper Trading Academy. ""They tend to be those bullish on technology as a disrupter to current industries, and this crossover and correlation is playing out currently."" The connection apparently holds fast when the market goes into reverse, he said. “For Institutions it is also easier to liquidate their crypto positions especially with the 24/7 access to their capital than some other positions, so they tend to be the first positions closed out,” he said. “In the past year-and-a-half, we’ve had new entrants to the digital assets market from the macro hedge fund world,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca wrote in a report. “It’s the players, not the assets, that are correlated.”",Business/CoinDesk•13 hours ago,Big-Money Investors Who Boosted Bitcoin’s Price Might Now Crash It,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-money-investors-boosted-bitcoin-203610665.html
5/17/2022,"(Reuters) - Intel Corp shareholders rejected compensation packages for top executives, including a payout of as much as $178.6 million to Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger, a regulatory filing showed on Monday. About 1.78 billion votes were cast against executive compensation at the annual meeting, Intel said, though the vote is non-binding. About 921.2 million votes were cast in favor. ""We take our investors' feedback very seriously, and we are committed to engaging with them and addressing their concerns,"" Intel said in a statement. The company said it had taken specific steps to address investor questions, including linking pay to performance but added ""there is clearly more work to do"". Gelsinger earned more than 1,700 times the typical employee at the chip giant in 2021, according to a regulatory filing in March. Intel forecast its second-quarter revenue and profit below Wall Street expectations in April, citing weak demand in its largest market, PCs, and increased supply-chain uncertainty due to fresh COVID-19 lockdowns in China.
