5/5/2022,"Tuesday’s interest rate rise means homeowners are now going to have to deal with something they have not had to deal with for more than 11 years. Not only that, but there is also the prospect of mortgage repayments never again being as low as they are now. It means housing affordability is going to become much worse. After a record 137 months without a rate rise, to be honest, in the end I thought the RBA’s reasons for raising the rate were rather feeble, given wages growth remains well below inflation. Philip Lowe’s statement read more like one searching for justifications rather than an explanation. The governor told reporters on Tuesday that “business liaison and various business surveys has indicated that there is now stronger upward pressure on labour costs”. Although he also noted that while “some firms are paying higher wages to attract and retain staff … there is still considerable inertia in the wages system”. Let us hope the data reflects the liaisons and surveys with businesses and not the inertia. As it is, last week’s inflation figures forced the RBA’s hand, not so much because raising the cash rate would stifle inflation, but because it meant the real cash rate (ie taking into account inflation) was absurdly low: Graph not displaying? Click here The cash rate remains 3.4 percentage points below underlying inflation, and thus monetary policy remains very expansionary. So it is not surprising that Lowe suggests more rises are on the way – possibly up to 2.5% by the end of next year. Such an increase remains well below the absurd predictions in the futures markets, which would have the cash rate above 3.9% by August next year – a speed of increase that would assuredly cause a recession: Graph not displaying?

We know house prices are absurd – in New South Wales, the average home loan is more than seven times that of average male full-time earnings: Graph not displaying? Click here But interest rates since November 2010 provided something of a buffer to falling affordability from rising house prices. Yes, saving for a deposit became a massive hurdle, but the mortgage repayments, at least, were not as bad as they might have been because rates kept being cut. But that is over now. It means the affordability of not only buying a house, but repaying the loan will be as bad as it has ever been. The balance of interest rates, loan sizes and earnings is why arguments that those under 40 don’t know how good they have it because they don’t have to pay 17% interest rates are rather silly. Back in 1990, when the standard variable rate hit 17%, the average new loan in NSW was about $100,000 and the average annual earnings for a full-time male were about $32,300. That meant mortgage repayments accounted for nearly 53% of such an annual income. Currently the repayments on a new average loan in NSW are about 45% of annual average male full-time earnings: Graph not displaying? Click here That might sound like those in the 1990s had it tougher, but they didn’t. Because here’s the thing: if you had taken a loan out in January 1990 you did not pay 52% of your average weekly earnings on repayments for long – because interest rates fell. Similarly, someone born in 1952, who in 1982 at the age of 30 took out an average-sized home loan in NSW of $40,200, made repayments worth only 28% of male full-time average earnings. And yes, in 1990 they too had to pay 17% rates – but while that increased the monthly repayments by 21% from $443 to $557 a month, in that same time, average annual male full-time earnings rose 73% from $18,662 to $32,318. By contrast someone born in 1980 who took out a loan in 2010 was looking at spending 43% of male average full-time earnings repaying their $400,000 loan. And even when interest rates fell to record lows they were still making repayments equivalent to about 23.4% of those earnings: Graph not displaying? Click here To put it another way: even with record low interest rates, a millennial would on average be paying more of their income on mortgage repayments than a baby boomer was when interest rates were at record highs. By the time someone taking out a 30 year loan in 1982 made their last repayment, it was equivalent to just 4.2% of a month of male-full-time earnings. Sure, they had to pay 17%, but they spent a lot more time paying a lot less on a much smaller loan, and their income rose faster than it does now. Consider that the total repayments over the first 10 years of a loan taken out in 1982 were worth 21% of male full-time earnings over that decade, compared to 27% for someone who took out a loan in 1990. But for someone who took out a loan in 2010, the average total repayments were equivalent to 34% of the total a male on average full-time earnings made from 2010-2019: Graph not displaying? Click here But here’s the real worry. Someone who took out a loan in 2020 has already spent on average the equivalent of 35% of male-full-time earnings repaying the mortgage. And that is likely as good as it is going to get. Let’s say interest rates go up 2.5% points as suggested by the governor of the RBA. That means by the end of next year the monthly repayments on a $610,000 average 2020 loan at the standard variable rate will rise by 31% from $3,098 to $4,067 in 18 months. Does anyone think wages will rise by that amount? Forget trying to say people are lucky now not to be paying 17% interest rates. Any way you slice it, housing affordability is much worse now, and about to get more so.",News/Business,"More interest rate hikes are coming, and housing affordability is about to get crunched | Greg Jericho",https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2022/may/05/more-interest-rate-hikes-are-coming-and-housing-affordability-is-about-to-get-crunched
5/5/2022,"The shock over China’s security deal with Solomon Islands is evidence of “a relationship failure” , New Zealand’s foreign affairs minister has said, confirming that the pact took New Zealand, Australia and other Pacific nations completely by surprise. The deal marks Beijing’s first known bilateral security agreement in the Pacific. The text of the final deal is secret, but a draft leaked on social media in March granted Chinese military and police significant access to the country, allowing China to “make ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands”. While there had been some knowledge of overtures from Beijing to the Solomons on policing, the deal’s scope came as a surprise to officials in Australia, Aotearoa New Zealand and across the Pacific. Speaking on Monday, Nanaia Mahuta told the Guardian that New Zealand’s first knowledge of the deal was when a draft was leaked online at the end of March, reinforcing statements from the defence minister, Peeni Henare, that it had caught Australia and New Zealand off-guard. “In terms of the detail of any security agreement, it would be fair to say that probably very few of the Pacific nations, New Zealand included, will have been aware of the detail of those discussions – or, in fact, how far those discussions had progressed to something material,” Mahuta said. She condemned the deal as “unwelcome and unnecessary”, and said in March that it “could destabilise the current institutions and arrangements that have long underpinned the Pacific region’s security”. On whether the two countries were surprised by specific details of the deal, or its very existence, the minister responded: “Both.” However, Australian politicians have been circumspect about whether the draft deal came as a surprise. Australia’s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, and the Pacific minister, Zed Seselja, both confirmed they did not know of the deal until it was leaked online at the end of March, but the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has refused to answer questions about what he knew, or when. Behind the scenes, Australian officials briefed some media outlets that Australian intelligence was aware of the agreement and were pushing for it to be leaked. “I would say that this is a relationship failure,” Mahuta said when asked if the shock leak represented an intelligence failure for Australia and New Zealand. “That’s why it’s so important for the Solomons to provide a level of transparency – to ensure that we can elevate the conversations around the impact of those arrangements around regional security and regional sovereignty to the Pacific Islands Forum.” Much of the responsibility for that breakdown in relationship, however, lay at the feet of the Solomons’ government, and, by extension, its prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, she suggested. “It would be good manners, and good protocol, to enable your neighbours to have a greater awareness and understanding of your concerns around regional security prior to entering into relationships outside the region,” she said. “While we respect the sovereignty of the Solomons and any nation in the Pacific, we also respect our contribution towards supporting and strengthening the cohesion of the Pacific.” Mahuta added that was “very much a New Zealand-centric view of where the relationship breakdown has occurred … I don’t want to conflate New Zealand’s position with Australia’s – we stand on our own two feet in relation to the way in which we work with our Pacific neighbours.” The deal raised immediate concerns from New Zealand, Australia and the United States about the prospect of a Chinese military base being built in the Solomons – and in the wider Pacific that the region could become a chessboard for geopolitical powers. Australia called the prospect of a military base a “red line”, and the US said it would “take action” in response to any base being built. Within the Solomons, Matthew Wale, the leader of the opposition, argued it “would make the Solomons a geopolitical playing field” and “further threaten the nation’s fragile unity”. Mahuta, however, said heated discussions of a possible military base were not helpful. “We’ve got to take this one step at a time,” she said. “The first conversation should be to understand the nature of the arrangements – because if we jump too quickly to a set of hypotheticals that aren’t confirmed … it’s not going to be helpful to the kind of conversation New Zealand believes would benefit the region.” She said New Zealand had to “take at face value” assurances from Solomon Islands that a naval base would not go ahead. “We would be deeply concerned if the nature of these arrangements led to the militarisation of the Solomon Islands,” she said. “We take at face value … [the assurance] that these arrangements will not lead to the militarisation of a base in Honiara … [although] it would be good to have something written down.” Within the Solomons, the agreement has raised concerns that Chinese forces could be used by authorities to squash dissent and protest. A cartoon widely shared in Solomon Islands on social media shows protesters being hemmed in by an armed Xi Jinping in military garb, while Sogavare stands behind Xi, saying: “He’s protecting you from you.” Mahuta tacitly acknowledged those concerns, saying New Zealand’s previous assistance during periods of unrest had been designed to assist the population broadly, rather than to benefit political elites. “New Zealand … when we respond to issues of unrest, like in the Solomons, our response is for all people in the Solomons, not just some people. So, again, it was a curious set of arrangements from our perspective,” she said. Even as the security deal continues to generate headlines, however, Mahuta said the greatest threats to the Pacific and its security were climate change and the economic impact of Covid. Last week the Pacific Elders’ Voice group, which includes former leaders of the Marshall Islands, Palau, Kiribati and Tuvalu, released a statement saying it was climate change, not military bases that needed the most urgent attention. “The big conversation for the Pacific is not necessarily a security conversation, but an economic conversation because the level of economic vulnerability of the Pacific has only been compounded by Covid and will continue to be compounded by climate change,” Mahuta said. “It’s not just security issues that create instability. It’s actually economic fragility. That is a challenge for the Pacific that needs to be discussed.”",News/World news,New Zealand foreign minister blames ‘relationship failure’ for China-Solomons security deal ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/new-zealand-foreign-minister-blames-relationship-failure-for-china-solomons-security-deal
