1/7/2022,"Former President Donald Trump was challenged to a debate by Arizona businessman Daniel McCarthy. McCarthy blasted Trump and said he would donate $1 million to charity if Trump accepts his offer. In 2020, McCarthy ran for Arizona's GOP senate nomination, but lost the primary race. A businessman who once ran for senate in Arizona — and who recently torched his MAGA using a flamethrower — has challenged former President Donald Trump to a live debate at the latter's upcoming rally and offered to donate $1 million to charity if the former president accepts. Daniel McCarthy, who ran for Arizona's Republican Senate nomination in 2020 but lost to former Senator Martha McSally, tweeted a strongly-worded video message for Trump on Wednesday. ""Hey, Donald Trump. This is Daniel McCarthy in Arizona. The world is waking up to your massive grift,"" McCarthy said while seated in the cab of a truck. ""Please stop with the smoke and mirrors and with these audits."" ""Stop with your fundraising, stop establishment candidate endorsements,"" McCarthy continued. ""Stop pushing this gene therapy, the sauce."" It's not immediately clear what McCarthy was referring to. He noted that Trump would be arriving in Arizona on January 15 for ""another one of your do nothing, rah-rah session rallies"" and suggested that Trump take 30 minutes of stage time to debate McCarthy or answer his questions in front of the former president's supporters. The businessman, who, according to his biography, works in skincare and real estate, pledged that if the former president accepts, he can choose from six charities listed on this website to donate a total of $1 million. The charities include a mobile anti-abortion ""crisis pregnancy"" center, a gun-rights lobbying group, and a legal defense fund for QAnon Shaman Jacob Chansley. Trump announced on Tuesday that he would be delivering public remarks at the Arizona rally after canceling a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida that had been scheduled for the anniversary of the Capitol riot. In the video, McCarthy proceeded to verbally attack Trump's presidency. ""Think about all the things you've done... that you've been held accountable for,"" he said. ""You ushered in medical tyranny. You exploded our national debt. You relinquished our sovereignty with the USMCA trade deal. You passed more gun laws than Obama did with Fix NICS,"" McCarthy continued. —Daniel McCarthy for Arizona (@DemandDanielAZ) January 4, 2022 McCarthy also believes that he lost the 2020 Arizona GOP primary because it was ""stolen."" He said Trump had failed to prevent ""election fraud"" — Trump's false claim that the presidential election was stolen from him — even though McCarthy said his team ""months in advance warned you that we were stolen from in the Senate primary."" McCarthy went on to blast Trump further, saying that the former president surrounded himself with ""swamp creatures for four years"" and that he had set up his ""most loyal supporters"" — those detained in connection with the Capitol attack on January 6, 2021. ""I look forward to seeing you on January 15,"" McCarthy said, ""Although I know you won't do it because you're a little bitch."" McCarthy is then shown exiting his truck and using a flamethrower to torch a ""Make America Great Again"" hat. McCarthy and Trump did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment.

1/7/2022,"JERUSALEM (AP) — One of the Israel Museum’s biggest patrons, American billionaire Michael Steinhardt, approached the flagship Israeli art institution in 2007 with an artifact he had recently bought: a 2,200-year-old Greek text carved into limestone. But shortly after it went on display, an expert noticed something odd — two chunks of text found a year earlier during a dig near Jerusalem fit the limestone slab like a jigsaw puzzle. It soon became clear that Steinhardt’s tablet came from the same cave where the other fragments were excavated. Last month, Steinhardt surrendered the piece, known as the Heliodorus Stele, and 179 other artifacts valued at roughly $70 million as part of a landmark deal with the Manhattan District Attorney’s office to avoid prosecution. Eight Neolithic masks loaned by Steinhardt to the Israel Museum for a major exhibition in 2014 were also seized under the deal, including two that remain exhibited at the museum. Museums worldwide are facing greater scrutiny over the provenance — or chain of ownership — of their art, particularly those looted from conflict zones or illegally plundered from archaeological sites. There are growing calls for such items to be returned to their countries of origin. Donna Yates, a criminologist specializing in artifact smuggling at Maastricht University, said that several recent scandals involving looted artifacts — such as the Denver Art Museum's return of Cambodian antiquities — are “causing museums to reconsider the ownership history of some of the objects that they have.” “They can’t really afford the public embarrassment of constantly being linked to this kind of thing, because museums aren’t wealthy and many of them hold a place of public trust,” she said. In addition to the Heliodorus Stele and two of the ancient masks, at least one other Steinhardt-owned artifact in the Israel Museum is of uncertain provenance: a 2,800-year-old inscription on black volcanic stone. The museum’s display states the origin as Moab, an ancient kingdom in modern-day Jordan. How it got to Jerusalem remains unclear. Steinhardt gave the Royal Moabite Inscription to the museum on extended loan in 2002, shortly after buying it from a licensed Israel dealer in Jerusalem, said Amir Ganor, who heads the Israel Antiquities Authority’s theft prevention unit. That dealer, who confirmed the deal but spoke on condition of anonymity because of the legal questions surrounding the item, told The Associated Press that he obtained the inscription from a Palestinian colleague in Bethlehem, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, who didn’t specify its provenance. “I don’t know how it got to the dealer in Jerusalem,” Ganor said. He said it could have come from the West Bank, neighboring Jordan or through Dubai, a longtime antiquities hub. The Israel Museum declined interview requests and refused to show the artifact’s documentation. But in a statement, it denied wrongdoing, saying it “consistently follows the applicable regulations at the time the works are loaned.” It said all displays are “in full cooperation” with the antiquities authority. The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office said the Moabite Inscription wasn’t part of the Steinhardt investigation and declined to discuss the item. James Snyder, who was the Israel Museum’s director from 1997 to 2016, said all artifacts coming to the museum have their provenance checked by the IAA before they’re exhibited, and that Steinhardt’s other looted artworks “came with documentation of legal ownership.” “We were given documentation of legal purchase, it was approved to come in on loan and it was approved to be returned” by the authority, Snyder said. Israel has a legal antiquities market run by some 55 licensed dealers. They are allowed to sell items discovered before 1978, when a law took effect making all newfound artifacts state property. This market has provided an outlet for the laundering of smuggled and plundered antiquities from around the Middle East that are given fabricated documentation by dealers in Israel. Israel began closing that loophole in 2016, when it mandated a digital database of dealers' artifacts. Israel recently returned smuggled antiquities found in dealers’ stores to Egypt  and Libya. Other antiquities stolen from Iraq and Syria — including thousands of cuneiform tablets purchased by Hobby Lobby owner Steve Green in 2010 — were smuggled to Israeli dealers before being sold to collectors with fraudulent documentation. Morag Kersel, archaeology professor at DePaul University in Illinois, said the wanton plunder of archaeological sites across the Middle East ultimately “is all demand driven.” “Looters do this because there’s someone like Steinhardt who’s willing to pay money and buy things that come straight out of the ground,” she said. Under the deal, the Manhattan District Attorney seized 180 of Steinhardt’s artifacts and will repatriate them to their respective countries. Steinhardt also agreed to a lifetime ban from acquiring antiquities — though it is unclear how that ban will be enforced. Steinhardt, 81, is a longtime patron of the Israel Museum and many other Israeli institutions, including a natural history museum at Tel Aviv University bearing his name. Since 2001, his family foundation has donated over $6.6 million to the Israel Museum, according to partial U.S. tax filings. Steinhardt was not accused of plundering any items himself and has said he did not commit any crimes. But the DA’s office said he “knew, or should have ascertained by reasonable inquiry” that the antiquities were stolen. Steinhardt declined an interview request. His office issued a brief statement saying the Manhattan DA “did not challenge Mr. Steinhardt’s right, title, or interest to any of the artifacts” other than those in the settlement. The DA began investigating Steinhardt’s massive antiquities collection in 2017 after he loaned a Bull’s Head sculpture to the Metropolitan Museum of Art that had been plundered from a site in Lebanon. The DA says the three items at the Israel Museum are “effectively seized in place,” and has opened talks with Israel to coordinate the return of 28 additional items. It said Steinhardt “has been unable to locate” the final nine items traced to Israel. Of those 40 artifacts, more than half are believed to have been plundered from West Bank sites, according to court documents. An additional nine artifacts from Jordan, many sold to Steinhardt through Israel’s licensed antiquities market, are also being repatriated. Neither the Jordanian government nor the Palestinian Tourism and Antiquities Ministry responded to requests for comment. Under interim peace deals in the mid-1990s, the fate of items taken from the occupied West Bank is to be part of a still elusive peace deal. The Israel Museum said it had only recently learned about the settlement and is currently examining the matter. For now, the plundered artifacts in the museum still bear Steinhardt’s name. ___ Follow Ilan Ben Zion on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ilanbenzion",World/Associated Press,Billionaire's looted art still on display at Israel Museum,https://news.yahoo.com/billionaires-looted-art-still-display-060904083.html
1/7/2022,"By Devjyot Ghoshal and Sankalp Phartiyal NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian police said on Thursday they had arrested a 20-year-old man they suspect created an online app that shared pictures of Muslim women for a virtual ""auction"", as an investigation into the case of communal harassment widened. An open source app on the Github platform called 'Bulli Bai' - a derogatory term to describe Muslim women - had shared pictures of dozens of women without their consent before it was taken down. K.P.S Malhotra, a police official in the capital New Delhi, said his team had arrested a 20-year-old engineering student from Jorhat in the eastern state of Assam after a probe that involved the state-run Computer Emergency Response Team. ""He is the person who had created the Bullibai app on Github. He had also created the Twitter handle @bullibai_ and other handles,"" Malhotra said. Police in the western city of Mumbai, who are also investigating the app, have separately arrested three people this week, including two 21-year-old engineering students and an 18-year-old woman. Mumbai police said they were investigating whether the app, which did not involve any actual auctioning of people, was part of a ""larger conspiracy"". Several Indian Muslim journalists were targeted by the app, including Ismat Ara who filed and then shared on social media a police complaint on Sunday that said the app was ""designed to insult Muslim women"". ""After today's arrest by @DelhiPolice, I hope the culprits behind this elaborate harassment of Muslim women, including journalists like myself, will ultimately be caught & punished,"" Ara said in a tweet on Thursday. Muslims account for around 14% of India's 1.3 billion population. Some sections of the community have been at odds with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration and Hindu right-wing supporters, including over a controversial 2019 citizenship law that triggered large-scale protests. The youngest of those arrested so far is from the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand. The 18-year-old began spending time on social media and made contact with Hindu right-wing users after finishing her school-leaving exams last year,a local police official who spoke to her earlier this week told Reuters. The official, who declined to be named, said she had told him that her actions were based on Hindu right-wing ideology, which she had picked up on social media platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter. ""She came to social media to distract herself but she kept getting entangled in it,"" the official said.
