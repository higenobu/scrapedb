2/11/2022,"Asked in 1978 to describe his job, the visual effects pioneer Douglas Trumbull said: “I’m in the area of creating experiences that are beyond the realm of physical reality.” Trumbull, who has died aged 79 from cancer, was instrumental in bringing to the screen three of the greatest science-fiction films ever made: Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner (1982). He was 23 when he began working with Kubrick. During a production schedule that lasted for more than two years, he went from designing graphics for the film’s computer screens to masterminding the kaleidoscopic “star gate” sequence, in which the astronaut Dave Bowman, played by Keir Dullea, passes through an intergalactic corridor of streaking, coloured light.  “We had to build new equipment, we had to build new types of cameras, we had to build lighting systems,” said Trumbull. He adapted the “slit-scan” photography technique, placing in front of the lens a giant movable slide with an aperture. To this set-up, he then added a backlit glass panel on to which patterns were projected while being photographed with a long exposure camera. Six months of experimentation produced the spectacular psychedelic effects that would endear the film to the acid-dropping midnight-movie crowd, while leaving sober viewers just as dazzled and disoriented. “We wanted the audience to feel like they were actually going to space,” he said. For Close Encounters of the Third Kind, he made advances in motion control photography to enable the camera to tilt and move for the first time with special effects in the frame. (Most effects shots prior to that had been static.) He also conjured the baleful cloud formations that precede the approach of the alien mothership. This he achieved by introducing white liquid paint into a colossal aquarium tank filled with water. “If Trumbull hadn’t accepted the job, I’d still be on the Columbia backlot, trying to get a cloud to materialise out of thin air,” said Spielberg. His contributions to Blade Runner included the moving images on the sides of skyscrapers and blimps, as well as the liberal use of smoke. Scott’s film earned Trumbull a third Oscar nomination following previous ones for his work on Close Encounters and Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979). On the latter title, he was entrusted with directing several sequences, including Spock’s space walk, during which Trumbull paid homage to his own work on 2001. He already had one directorial credit under his belt by then: the prescient and poignant Silent Running (1972), which starred Bruce Dern as a botanist tending to Earth’s last remaining forest. Rescued from the planet, which is now denuded of all plant life, the flora is contained within greenhouse-like bio-domes on a spaceship called the Valley Forge. Though the film was retitled in some territories as 2002: The Second Odyssey, it was far more modest in scale than Kubrick’s work. Instead of the plush bombast of Strauss on the soundtrack, Trumbull used original songs by Joan Baez to establish a reflective tenor. Trumbull was born in Los Angeles, to Marcia Hunt, an artist, and Donald Trumbull, a special effects rigger whose credits included The Wizard of Oz (1939) and, later, the original Star Wars (1977), which Douglas had turned down. Though Donald moved into the aerospace industry after Douglas was born, father and son ended up working on several of the same films. On Silent Running, Douglas hired his father to oversee the trio of waddling robots, named Huey, Dewey and Louie after Donald Duck’s nephews. Douglas was educated at Morningside high school and El Camino college in LA County. He parlayed his enthusiasm for science fiction and his skill at drawing into work as a background illustrator at Graphic Films, a Los Angeles studio making animated simulations for Nasa. To the Moon and Beyond, a short which screened at the 1964 New York World’s Fair, brought him to Kubrick’s attention. “It just turned out that I had this weird skill set that lent itself to what his needs were,” he said, “and I started solving some problems and building weird gizmos for photography.” He was surprised to find that the technological gauntlet thrown down by Kubrick’s movie was not widely taken up by other film-makers. “We thought at the time that 2001 would start a big trend,” he said. “It really didn’t … The main effect it had … is that people look at 2001 and say: ‘No one’s ever going to do this again …’” A stint doing effects work on the ending of Zabriskie Point (1969) was short-lived. He was fired by the director, Michelangelo Antonioni, who chose instead to use more traditional techniques. (Trumbull later incorporated into Blade Runner some of the footage he had shot for Antonioni.) He developed for The Andromeda Strain (1971) a camera that could relay images seen through a microscope. In 1974, he established with Richard Yuricich a special effects research facility to explore new technology. In 1983, he directed his second feature, Brainstorm, a thriller about a device that enables users to experience pre-recorded sensations uploaded on to a virtual reality-style headset, from the giddiness of a rollercoaster ride to the horror of a heart attack. Trumbull was unsuccessful in his attempt to convince MGM to let him make the movie in his own pioneering Showscan format, which projected 70mm film at 60 frames per second, rather than the usual 24. The film was greeted with lukewarm reviews, and came to be associated with the death of its star, Natalie Wood, who drowned in suspicious circumstances during a break from production. Trumbull distanced himself from the industry after this, though he continued to work in the field of technical innovation and immersive entertainment. He designed the Back to the Future ride at the Universal theme park in Florida, and helped to popularise the Imax format. He also worked on sequences imagining the creation of the universe in Terrence Malick’s The Tree of Life (2011). It was that early collaboration with Kubrick, though, that lingered throughout his life in good ways and bad. Though he referred to the director as his “mentor”, the pair fell out after Kubrick, credited on screen as the designer and director of the “special photographic effects”, won a visual effects Oscar for the film. Trumbull, who was credited along with three colleagues as “special photographic effects supervisor”, believed the director ought to have insisted on sharing the award. A rapprochement of sorts was initiated by Trumbull, who phoned the director out of the blue in the 1990s to thank him for the effect he had on his career. Trumbull is survived by his third wife, Julia Hobart, whom he married in 2012, and by two daughters, Amy and Andromeda, from his first marriage, to Cherry, which ended in divorce. His second wife, Ann Vidor, died in 2001.

2/11/2022,"The six puppies were dumped in a crate on the verge of a main road in Kent. Four cocker spaniels and two terrier crossbreeds, bright-eyed and full of life despite being abandoned like fly-tipped rubbish. A passerby took them to the RSPCA’s Canterbury branch, where they were fed, watered and nursed back to health before being fostered by staff while permanent homes were found.  They are safe, but animal charities have warned that the end of the “puppy mania” that seized so many people in lockdown could mean that dangerous times are ahead for countless young dogs. There is concern that as demand – and thus prices – fall, unscrupulous breeders may find themselves with puppies they cannot turn a profit on and dump them. As more people return to physical workplaces, fears are growing that new owners may try to sell on dogs on to inappropriate homes or simply abandon them. Over Christmas, the RSPCA received reports of 1,478 abandoned dogs and other animals, up 29% on the previous year. A spokesperson said this week: “We have long feared that the combination of a surge in spur-of-the-moment pet ownership during the pandemic, the change in people’s circumstances as some normality returned, and the economic impacts of the pandemic could be a perfect storm for abandonments.” RSPCA inspector Clive Hopwood, who dealt with the Kent puppies last month, suspects they may have been abandoned by a breeder. “We’ve seen a massive surge in dog ownership,” he said. “Many people have seen this as an easy opportunity to make money by breeding and selling puppies. We believe these puppies may have failed to sell, so they were abandoned. We’re expecting to see more dogs abandoned.” There have been other abandonments over the last few months. Fifteen sick cockapoo-type puppies, believed to be from two litters, were dumped in a dirty crate at the side of a road in Pitsea, Essex. One of the cockapoos was dead when it arrived at the RSPCA’s centre and three others were so ill they had to be put down. There are some horribly sad stories. Just before Christmas the bodies of four newborn puppies were found next to a road in Darlington while three dead newborns, possibly staffordshire bull terriers, were dropped into a canal in Tipton, West Midlands, and at the end of January the bodies of two pups thought to be German shepherds were discovered next to a canal in Leeds. One of the most curious cases was the discovery by Rob Carter, the managing director of a Winchester construction company who discovered seven beautiful Labrador puppies running free as he cycled home in October. “What was remarkable was how calm they were. They were clearly used to human contact,” he said. “They had no collars on, no form of identification. They had just been abandoned.” Carter, a dog lover himself, phoned for help and a kennels came out to pick the dogs up. Before the pandemic, the average price of a dog was £876, rising to £2,237 in March 2021, according to the online marketplace Pets4Homes. By the summer it was down to £1,873 and continues to fall. Some online sellers were this week offering puppies at sharply reduced prices: American bullies down from £3,000 to £1,800; cavapoos from £2,200 to £1,800; and jugs (a hybrid of a pug and a jack russell) from £650 to £450. A spokesperson for Pets4Homes: said: “It would seem that puppy mania in the UK has peaked and normality is returning.” Kennels are not reporting a flood of incoming puppies, but this is not necessarily a good thing, the charity Blue Cross said. It pointed out that people who paid inflated prices for dogs at the height of the pandemic would want to recoup some of their outlay and are more likely to sell on their dogs rather than give them up to a charity for re-homing. “That can lead to dogs being unsettled and having behavioural problems or being housed in inappropriate settings,” said a spokesperson. The Kennel Club published research in the summer that found almost a quarter (23%) of all owners feared they would no longer be able to provide a suitable home for dog when “normal life” resumed. As more and more people return to physical workplaces, Bill Lambert, a spokesperson for the Kennel Club, said it could be a challenging time: “The fear is there is going to be an influx [of] rescues. Now is the danger time.”",News/World news,‘Now is the danger time’: why the end of lockdown puts puppies at risk,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/11/now-is-the-danger-time-why-the-end-of-lockdown-puts-puppies-at-risk
2/11/2022,"The Location, Location, Location presenter Kirstie Allsopp has some advice for young people wanting to buy their first home. Think twice about going to university and racking up student debt. Move back in with your parents for three years if you can. Stop going to the gym, watching Netflix, buying coffee from Starbucks and taking a couple of easyJet flights abroad each year. And be prepared to move to a cheaper part of the country if necessary. For someone who has made a living out of telling people how to get the best value for money out of their property, Allsopp’s maths is a little suspect. Assuming you are paying your parents no rent, you are probably saving yourself about £7,000 per year. Given that the average deposit, according to Halifax, is £59,000, you are going to have to stay with your parents for eight and a half years – assuming house prices don’t rise during that period. And if staying with your parents isn’t an option, it will take you 37 years to save for a deposit if you’re relying on cutting out coffee, the gym, streaming TV and overseas holidays. Nor does Allsopp seem to have thought through how moving to a cheaper part of the country might work if your job is in the south-east. Then there is the knock-on effect. If young people from London all move to the north to find affordable housing, where are those living in the north supposed to buy? There will always be someone who loses out. Though not Kirstie. She walked to work, went without a foreign holiday or two and soon had cash spare to buy her own house. That was in 1981, when the average house price was £51,000. And she was helped out by her parents.  The Mail on Sunday and the Daily Mail have been publishing extracts of Michael Ashcroft’s biography of Carrie Johnson. It’s been hard to keep track of her apparent crimes against humanity but they include using her husband’s phone to send messages rubbishing MPs she doesn’t like and getting Boris to change his mind about decisions he has made. Then there are the friends she insisted be given important jobs in Downing Street and the enemies she tried to have fired. However, Carrie’s greatest offence appears to be that she isn’t his second wife, Marina, who was considered a steadying influence and would put up with any old shit – up until the moment she decided she had had enough, of course. One colleague of Boris was quoted as saying: “He’s fallen out with his children, he’s lost Marina, and since he became prime minister so many of the problems he’s had have been because of Carrie … His potential to transform the country has been squandered. It’s like a toxic relationship. He’s isolated. It’s very sad.” To which any sane person would say: “What a load of sexist crap.” Boris isn’t some passive receptacle in all this. He is responsible for his own choices. Carrie can do or say what she likes but it’s Johnson who should have the final say on what goes on in government. If he can’t manage that, it’s not his wife’s fault. After all, it isn’t as if his back catalogue of malice, infidelities, incompetence and bad faith don’t predate his marriage to Carrie by many decades. The clues were all there and it’s just the country’s bad luck that the Tories chose to ignore them when they elected him as their leader. RIP Bamber Gascoigne. The original and – for me at least – the best presenter of University Challenge. Call me chippy, but I still think I detect a pro-Oxbridge bias in Jeremy Paxman, something you never used to get with Gascoigne. I first started watching University Challenge back in the 60s with my dad and I’ve scarcely missed an episode since. My best years were when my children were in their teens and I could get them to sit in silence and score for me while I concentrated on the answers. I didn’t differentiate between starter and bonus questions: I just awarded myself one point for each answer I got right. And I had some handy cheats. Any maths ones I didn’t know, I just shouted out 0 or -1. While pre-impressionist French painters came up a lot and were invariably Delacroix or David. Now the kids have left home, I have to score myself, which wrecks my concentration. I did also once get invited on to the show to represent Exeter in a Christmas special edition about 10 years ago and I thought it would be a dream come true. Far from it. Not only did our team not have anyone who could answer the science questions, we were up against one man on the Glasgow team who was lightning-quick on the buzzer. Come the halfway mark we were losing by something like 100 points to 20 and I had humiliated myself by misspelling mozzarella. We then decided to change tactics and start pressing the buzzer even if we weren’t wholly certain of the answer; by the end we had managed to claw things back so we only lost by about 160 to 125. Hardly a triumph, though. Hubris, thy name is Crace. There may well be many benefits to the UK leaving the EU – Boris Johnson is curiously reluctant to implement one, the cutting of 20% VAT on fuel bills, that would make an immediate difference to everyone – but the government appears loath to tell us what they are. During the Brexit referendum we were promised the country would be far better off, that we could carve out more advantageous trade deals and that deregulation would reduce bureaucracy and cut prices. Six years on, even the low-hanging Brexit fruits have remained tantalisingly out of reach. So much so that Johnson used his largely cosmetic reshuffle this week to demote Jacob Rees-Mogg to the newly created role of minister for Brexit opportunities. If you think Jakey has a plan and is about to spoil us with treats, then think again. For today Rees-Mogg has written an open letter in the Sun asking readers to tell him exactly what these Brexit opportunities are. Though some might think twice before replying, as Rees-Mogg compares himself to Lord Kitchener putting out the all-persons “Your Country Needs You” poster. You might remember that what the country needed men for in 1914 was to die in their hundreds of thousands in a bloodbath of futile gestures. Rees-Mogg also appears confused as the only example of a Brexit benefit he can cite is the Johnson lie that being outside the European Medicines Agency allowed the UK to be the first to implement a Covid vaccine programme. This is simply untrue. And presumably we are expected to look on the extra 215m customs declaration forms that HMRC predicts are heading our way each year as exciting Brexit red tape gains. In the meantime we can only hope the country hasn’t run out of ideas for a bright Brexit future. Even if the government has. New research by a team from Cambridge University, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, has found that people from around the world with the same personality types tend to like the same types of music. Neurotics, it seems, are universally fond of David Bowie. Something I am happy to confirm. Though I can’t say I’m also a big fan of punk and heavy metal, which also appeal to neurotics. My mosh pit days are well behind me. Not that they ever really started. Nowadays you’re more likely to find me at the opera or classical music gigs – which apparently makes me open and agreeable, according to the research. Not words my wife often associates with me. Then, I don’t listen to Journey and Coldplay, so there are clearly limits to my openness and agreeability. Still, I am open and agreeable enough to be enjoying the feeling of the world slowly returning to normal after two years living under the shadow of Covid. When I travel on public transport, go into work or go to the opera – I went to Theodora at the Royal Opera this week and it was sensational, get a ticket if you can – I no longer feel like I am taking my life into my hands. Though perhaps I have just – like the government – become demob happy, as Covid infections still remain stubbornly high. In his race to appease the libertarians in the Tory party and make the UK free from all restrictions, Boris Johnson does appear to have abandoned any pretence of following the science. It can’t be a good idea to do away with self-isolation requirements for people who have Covid when there are no plans to protect the immunosuppressed and other vulnerable groups. Perhaps we’d all be better off waiting until Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance are willing to endorse the government’s plan at a Downing Street press conference. Their absence from our screens perhaps tells its own story. Digested week, digested: One Dick resigns. Just one more to go.

2/11/2022,"She doesn’t pretend this isn’t hard. Devastating, even. When you’ve won as often as Mikaela Shiffrin – three overall World Cup titles, two Olympic gold medals, more victories on alpine skiing’s top flight than all but two people in history – the acid taste of coming up short under the brightest lights will never be easy. Nor should it. But as the 26-year-old American stood at the bottom of the women’s super-G course on Friday having crossed the finish line for the first time in three races at the Beijing Olympics, the familiar smile that’s been absent throughout the most arduous week of her professional life was back.  It wasn’t the result she wanted. Shiffrin needed 1min 14.30sec to negotiate the icy track known as the Rock, coming in 0.79sec behind the early leader and eventual gold medalist Lara Gut-Behrami, of Switzerland, beneath a pale blue sky on the south side of Xiaohaituo Mountain. But simply making it down the course and finishing ninth overall was reason enough to feel good amid the lowest week of a career defined by dizzying highs. “It felt really nice to ski that today,” Shiffrin said. “There’s been a lot of disappointment over the last week. There’s a lot of emotions. [It was] not really easy to reset and know if I was up for the challenge today. “The track itself is beautiful, and it’s sunny, and the snow is amazing. Coming back out and getting the chance to race again was just the perfect thing to do, actually.” Shiffrin’s disqualifications for missing gates early in her opening runs of Monday’s giant slalom and Wednesday’s slalom were unexpected enough. After all, the Colorado native had failed to finish a race only twice in four years entering the Beijing Games – and a total of 13 times in 228 starts across all disciplines at World Cup, Olympic and world championship events. The shock was compounded by the fact they happened in two of her best events – the disciplines at the foundation of her dominance and metronomic consistency – striking destructive blows to her confidence. Not since December 2011, when she was 16, had Shiffrin failed to make it to the bottom in back-to-back technical races. Her ninth-place finish on Friday came in the speed race which she’s only contested twice in the past two months on the World Cup circuit (where she is once again the overall points leader). She opted to skip the super-G entirely at her first two Olympics, but winning it at the 2019 world championships made her a strong contender to reach the podium in Beijing. That was before Shiffrin was unable to navigate more than 12 gates in her first two outings, throwing her plans of entering as many as six events at these Olympics into question. Battered by self-doubt and battling what she described as “emotional fatigue” after her nightmarish start, Shiffrin went through three training runs on Thursday before deciding that she felt OK to race. “I feel emotionally weary right now, there’s just a sense of dullness, and you can’t have that racing, especially not racing speed,” Shiffrin said. “But when we got out today I just felt a little bit more settled, a little bit quieter, trying to keep some calmness and just trying to focus on the task at hand so I could put my attention where I wanted and ski the hill and the course properly. “It’s a really big relief to be here now in the finish, having skied a run well. I wasn’t skiing safe or anything, but I also did get to the finish and that’s really nice for my heart to know that it’s not totally abandoning everything I thought I knew about the sport.” Athletes at the Olympics are under no obligation to speak with the media while passing through the mixed zone after an event. But after both of her DNFs and again on Friday, Shiffrin has spent hours fielding a stream of questions. Even more impressively she did not simply resort to the canned soundbites that are amply within the scope of her years of media training, but lengthy, thoughtful and considered responses that have shown a real-time grappling with a crisis of confidence. On one hand Shiffrin’s professionalism comes as no surprise. She has always embraced the responsibilities that come with being the face of a sport and, for a second straight Winter Games, the tentpole of NBC’s breathless promotion of the Olympics in the United States. But the real test comes when not everything is falling your way. And she’s handled all of it with a remarkable self-awareness, humility, empathy and often brutal honesty. Throughout Friday’s marathon session with the press, Shiffrin acknowledged her crushing disappointment and confessed to a sometimes unhealthy obsession with competition in one moment while maintaining a balanced perspective on her blessed life and career in the next. “A lot of athletes have said before pressure’s a privilege, and it truly is, to be in the position that I come to the Olympics and I’m a contender, and actually expected to medal in multiple events,” she said. “That’s spectacular. It says a lot about the work that my whole team, we’ve all done to this point. “But it’s an enormous letdown when it doesn’t happen. I can go back and say I’ve won medals before in my career and that’s wonderful, but it doesn’t take away any hurt or disappointment from these races. I think it’s possible to feel both proud of a career and sad for the moment you’re in.” The direct and transparent manner in which Shiffrin has managed this trying hour – not falling back on credible excuses like the back injury that limited her preparations in November, or the bout with Covid that sidelined her in December, or the all-encompassing grief over the unexpected death of her father which caused her to openly contemplate retirement – has laid down an example that everyone can learn from: life goes on. As a press flack tried to wrangle Shiffrin away, the American insisted on answering one final question when asked about a word that keeps coming up amid her third Olympic campaign: failure. “Failure is a scary word, and disappointment, all the negative words, because we’re supposed to be kind to ourselves. But I do consider it failure. I think a lot of people do. It’s just tough to see that word in the headline of an article, and it feels like clickbait to say ‘crashes out, fails, disappoints the world, chokes’. They’re just harsh words, but I’ve finally come to terms with that being a little bit part of what we’re doing here. “I’ve had a lot of moments where I didn’t fail as well, so it all comes out in the wash in the end.”",Sport/Sport,Mikaela Shiffrin: ‘Failure is scary but I’ve had a lot of spectacular moments’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/11/mikaela-shiffrin-failure-is-scary-but-ive-had-a-lot-of-spectacular-moments
2/11/2022,"From Kingstanding in Birmingham to Becontree in east London, architects are calling for England’s draughty interwar suburbs to be wrapped in insulation in a national drive to slash carbon emissions. The Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) has calculated that insulation, double- or triple-glazing and gas boiler replacement in 3.3m interwar homes which sprawl around England’s towns and cities, could cut the country’s carbon emissions by 4% – helping it towards the net zero target by 2050.  The professional body is calling for a national programme and has costed the works at up to £38bn, which far exceeds current government green homes subsidies. But it believes the works could prove cheaper because the repetitive designs of the terraced and semi-detached homes should allow for economies of scale in a mass rollout. It also foresees savings of more than £500 a year in energy bills in many cases. Riba is calling for policies to incentivise private owners, who own more than 70% of interwar homes, and social landlords to fund the works. The proposal comes as householders face soaring utility prices. With a fifth of residents of poorly insulated interwar homes already in fuel poverty, they look likely to be among the worst-hit. Around half of the interwar homes – those built between 1919 and 1930 – have uninsulated solid walls which are responsible for almost half of heat loss. Those built between 1930 and 1945 mostly have cavity walls, few of which have been insulated. “There can be no further delay in embarking on a national programme of home retrofitting, which will transform UK housing, creating warm and cheaper-to-heat homes while bringing health and wider societal benefits,” said Simon Allford, the president of Riba. “This process will drastically reduce fuel poverty, create half a million green jobs, and positively contribute to the national levelling up agenda.” But experts have cautioned that some measures to retrofit housing to cut carbon emissions are more cost-effective than others. Jan Rosenow, the Europe director at the Regulatory Assistance Project, a clean energy thinktank, said loft and cavity wall insulation were among measures that delivered the best “bang for buck” in terms of cutting carbon, while solid-wall insulation was less efficient. Investing the money in other carbon-cutting technologies such as renewable energy might be more cost-effective. But solid wall insulation also makes homes more comfortable. Rosenow also said he believed the Riba estimates of 4% carbon savings were too optimistic. Jess Ralston, an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “Efficiency is the first crucial step to limiting our [energy] demand. “Once we have done that we can fill the gaps with cheaper renewables, bring out homes down to zero emissions and save money on bills.” Riba’s plan comes amid a growing campaign among architects to “retrofit-first”, to reduce the carbon emissions from creating new buildings. Campaigners claimed a victory last month when the multinational bank Citigroup chose not to demolish its 42-storey skyscraper at Canary Wharf, and instead plan to retrofit it, saving 100,000 tonnes of embodied carbon. Energy use in homes accounts for about 14% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions. Only 10% of interwar homes achieve an energy performance certificate (EPC) above band C. If current band D rated homes were retrofitted to achieve band C performance, households would save £511 a year under the proposed 2022 energy price cap, Riba said. A higher proportion of households who live in interwar homes (17%) are fuel poor than the general population (13%) which means living in a home with an energy efficiency rating below band D or having an income below the poverty line after housing and energy bills. Energy use in homes accounts for about 16% of England’s greenhouse gas emissions, producing a total of 58.5m tonnes of CO2 every year. These emissions need to fall by about a quarter by 2030 from 1990 levels for the UK to meet its carbon budget, yet housing is one of the only sectors where the implementation of measures to reduce emissions has stalled, Riba argues. Rates of installation of cavity wall, solid wall and loft insulation all fell between 2012 and 2017. The independent Climate Change Committee, chaired by Lord Deben, the former Conservative environment secretary John Gummer, has calculated that to get to net zero the UK needs to spend £55bn on improving efficiency in existing homes by 2050. It warns that buildings of all types are one of the most costly challenges across the economy but that for every £12bn spent each year, there could be annual operating savings of £5bn. While some homes will require much more, close to two-thirds of homes need no more than £1,000 spent on retrofitting energy efficiency measures.",News/Society,Architects call for mass insulation of England’s interwar suburbs,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/11/architects-call-for-mass-insulation-of-englands-interwar-suburbs
2/11/2022,"The leader of a party in Belgium’s governing coalition has sparked a debate after proposing that the country abolish internet shopping to let its high streets thrive and reduce night warehouse work. Paul Magnette, the leader of the Socialist party and mayor of Charleroi, Belgium’s third-biggest city, said he feared the current trends were hollowing out urban centres and driving down working conditions.  “Let Belgium become a country without e-commerce,” Magnette told the Francophone newspaper Humo. “I don’t think e-commerce is progress, but social and ecological degradation. Why do we have to let workers work in those warehouses at night? Because people want to buy around the clock and have their parcels at home within 24 hours. Can we really not wait two days for a book?” According to Eurostat, 75% of Belgians aged 16 to 74 made a purchase online in 2021, just above the average among the 27 EU member states. Denmark had the highest proportion of internet shoppers (91%) and Bulgaria the lowest (33%). The Covid pandemic has sped up the transition. In March 2020, about 40% of UK shoppers said they had been shopping more online than before the pandemic. By February 2021, this proportion had grown to approximately 75%, according to Statista. Magnette’s comments had been made before a decision of the federal government on possible changes to the regulations on night work, a reform deemed necessary by some in order for Belgium to keep up with neighbouring countries such as the Netherlands. Companies in Belgium must pay a night rate for work carried out after 8pm. A new system is under consideration where a daily rate is applicable for 20 of the 24 hours of a day, if a union representing staff in the company is in agreement. Magnette argued that night work should instead be limited to where it was strictly necessary, including within the emergency services, as he claimed that the biggest risk facing Belgium was “not unemployment, but the long-term sick”. A spokesman for the Socialist party later clarified that Magnette was not opposed to the digital sector but that he wanted there to be a debate about the consequences of internet shopping. The comments nevertheless drew scornful responses from his political foes. Egbert Lachaert, the chairman of the Open VLD, a Flemish conservative-liberal party, tweeted: “Going back to the economy of 100 years ago will not help us. E-commerce can now provide jobs for thousands of people. We’re not going to let that go, are we?” Georges-Louis Bouchez, a senator in the liberal Francophone Reformist Movement party said: “The 19th century cannot be a model of society. Progress is an opportunity. We need an open mind and adaptability in our society for greater wellbeing. We should not just leave e-commerce to other countries. We would lose hundreds of millions.” Asked to comment on the debate, Vincent Van Peteghem, the federal finance minister and a member of the Christian Democratic and Flemish party, said he recognised the need to strike the right balance. “I do not think it should be one or the other, but rather one and the other,” he said, adding that it was important to have “an e-commerce sector which is sustainable and which functions with adequate working conditions”.",News/World news,"Abolish internet shopping in Belgium, says leader of party in coalition",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/11/abolish-internet-shopping-belgium-says-paul-magnette-socialist-leader-coalition
2/11/2022,"What began as Pulitzer prize-winning journalism in the New York Times in 2019, and was later expanded into a book and a podcast, has made its final transformation into an audiobook. A collection of essays, poems and fictional works by more than 50 writers, The 1619 Project is a remarkable reframing of American history in which slavery and the Black experience are at the heart of the narrative. It traces the birth of a nation not to 1776 and the American revolution but to August 1619, when a ship arrived at Point Comfort in Virginia carrying a cargo of between 20 and 30 African captives, beginning a system of chattel slavery that would continue for 250 years. Discussing the origins of the project, journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones recalls her realisation that the history taught to her at school had “rendered Black Americans, Black people on all the earth, inconsequential at best, invisible at worst. We appeared only where unavoidable.” Elsewhere, Yaa Gyasi, Honorée Fanonne Jeffers, Terry McMillan, Wesley Morris and Barry Jenkins are among those considering themes of democracy, capitalism, music, religion and justice, each piece given renewed power through the voice of its author. Among the many highlights is a section, written and read by Robert Jones Jr, about an offer of freedom to enslaved men in 1775 by Lord Dunmore, the royal governor of Virginia, in return for joining the British Army, in which the narrator wonders whether Dunmore is a man of his word. “Never safe to trust toubab,” he says, with profound melancholy. “If you remember the ship, if it didn’t take your mind from you, then you understand.”   The 1619 Project is available on Penguin Audio, 18hr 57min.

2/11/2022,"“It’s very draughty and cold,” said Rahimah Baccass, 68, who lives in one of the hundreds of three-bedroom semis built in the 1930s after a slum clearance in Upney, east London. Recently her gas heating broke down for three days and she was “absolutely freezing”, wrapping up in layers of jumpers and hot-water bottles. The retired civil servant is one of millions of people living in interwar housing – from Blackpool to Barking – which the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) has identified as in urgent need of overhaul. Many homeowners have already tried to fix the problems with uPVC double glazing and loft insulation, but the biggest problems – uninsulated walls and cash- and carbon-guzzling boilers – are harder to crack.  “We have double glazing, but it’s difficult to keep warm,” said Baccass. “I tried to go for cavity wall insulation but it was too expensive.” With rising gas heating and food bills, she is now considering switching the heating on only once instead of three times daily. More worryingly, she is having to rethink what food she buys, a particular problem as she is diabetic. “I was always able to buy good value food that is good for my body, but now I am tempted to buy some of the rubbish.” In Kingstanding in north Birmingham, the largest council housing development in Europe when it was created in the 1930s, Lee Mason, 80, has also decided that insulating his walls – the source of about 50% of heat loss in many cases, according to the RIBA – was too expensive. He installed solar panels on the roof and insulated the loft, but was told it would cost several thousand pounds to insulate his walls, which were built without cavities. “We’re very economical, we can’t do any more to be honest with you,” he said. “We only heat the lounge and the kitchen during the day. And our fuel bills are reasonable at the moment. But getting the walls insulated is a lot of money.” Nearby lives Sharon Merryweather, 62, who has felt the benefit of insulating the loft of her 1937 home before Christmas, to save money before the energy price rises come in. “Without insulation it can be quite draughty, but luckily we haven’t had a bad winter this year,” she said. “The bedrooms are much warmer since we’ve had the [loft] insulation put in though.” Tam, 39, a mother-of-two living in an interwar home in Dagenham, said it was long past time that the government tackled insulation. She said her “penny-pinching” landlord refused to insulate the walls. There are draughts around doors and a 5cm gap in one room between the skirting and floorboards that lets cold air stream in. She is already paying £80 a month on her gas meter and is regularly in her emergency credit. “It’s hard to keep it warm, but I need it warm,” she said. “I can’t have my children going cold.”",News/Business,‘Absolutely freezing’: life in England’s draughty 1930s homes,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/11/absolutely-freezing-life-in-englands-draughty-1930s-homes
2/11/2022,"“I can’t see, I can’t see,” Omar Elabdellaoui shouted at a friend after a firework exploded in his face on New Year’s Eve 2020. Gunpowder and metal had penetrated his skin and eyeballs and his jacket was burning. His wife, Anne, ran to help put out the flames but the devastation was obvious. It was to be the start of a long road to recovery for the Galatasaray defender, who is in the frame to make a miraculous first-team return on Saturday after 11 surgeries to restore his vision, having been clinically blind. “I just thought I had something in my eye and had to clear it out but then I felt my face totally burning and everything was black,” Elabdellaoui recalls. He was in the garden preparing to light a third firework with friends and family, including his three children, when it went off prematurely as he tried to light the fuse. An ambulance came within minutes but Istanbul’s size meant it took a long time to reach the hospital. By the time Elabdellaoui arrived, journalists and teammates were waiting – the story had travelled fast across social media once a photo of his badly burned face, taken in the ambulance, was posted.  “I didn’t really have control over the first days,” the Norwegian says in impressive English developed during a spell in Manchester City’s academy. “Everything was dark – I didn’t know if it was night or day. Time was irrelevant.” There was anger among Elabdellaoui’s nearest and dearest that a person supposedly sent to help had shared a picture of him at such a traumatic time. Some demanded the accused be sacked or sued but Elabdellaoui asked only for an apology, knowing further punishment would help nobody. He is yet to receive one. As doctors assessed the injuries, Elabdellaoui’s career looked over. “There were a lot of people and noise,” he says. “Voices become so much louder as you hear everything when you can’t see. The longer it took, the more afraid I was.” The 30-year-old had been in Istanbul for a matter of months after moving from Olympiakos but was already a popular member of the squad. Teammates offered support, spending hours at the hospital. The then head coach, Fatih Terim, left his New Year’s celebration to join them, and Elabdellaoui’s brother Rashid and his agent, Mikail Adampour, travelled to be there. The damage to Elabdellaoui’s face meant his brother could not recognise him and collapsed to the hospital floor in tears. “I tried desperately to understand but it was difficult,” Elabdellaoui says. “Because of all the gunpowder my face was burned. I think it was difficult for them to say how bad it was straight away. In one moment I grabbed the doctor to say: ‘Just tell me the truth, tell me how bad it is.’ She said: ‘Your left eye doesn’t look too bad but your right eye, we do not know.’ But the way she said it, I knew it was not good.” There was a chink of light, literally and metaphorically, as vision started to return to Elabdellaoui’s left eye, allowing him to see shapes and colours. “I didn’t dare to sleep. As soon as I got a bit of light after a few days in my left eye, I was afraid to sleep as I was afraid of the darkness, so was afraid to close my eyes. Even though it was a tiny bit of light from my left, I was always checking if the light was there because I was afraid of losing it.” It was obvious there was no simple solution to get Elabdellaoui his sight back, let alone playing football again. Adampour, of Tempo Sports Group, and the club doctor Yener Ince set about finding the treatment to give him the best chance. Extensive research was done and inquiries made at hospitals from the UK to China and Canada. Last February Elabdellaoui travelled with his agent to see Dr Edward Holland at the Cincinnati Eye Institute, where Holland has pioneered corneal transplant surgery. He would end up spending six months, on and off, in the US. Like the body, the eyeball has layers of skin for protection but Elabdellaoui had burned away all the tissue that creates new skin, leaving his right eye in the state you would expect of a third-degree burns victim. He had also burned away his tear ducts. Corneal transplants are very effective when the ocular surface skin is healthy but Elabdellaoui’s was anything but. His iris was opaque and to complicate matters he had lost one-third of his upper eyelid. A strategy was created to get the eye to a state where a corneal transplant could be considered, and the processes had to be fast-tracked to give Elabdellaoui a chance of resuming his career. Holland gave Elabdellaoui a 5-10% chance of getting his sight back because it was one of the worst injuries he had examined in a 35-year career. He described it as four times worse than those suffered by an American soldier he treated who was blinded by a bomb in Afghanistan. The first stage was to calm and stabilise the eye with oral and topical anti-inflammatory medications, using procedures to reinforce the surface. Doctors used an amnionic membrane from human placenta, a technique borrowed from dermatology, to create a pseudo skin. A new eyelid was also needed because an eye cannot function without one; it is required for protection and to keep it moist. For that, membrane was taken from inside Elabdellaoui’s mouth and skin from one of his ears by plastic surgeons. By spring the medics and Elabdellaoui could move to the stages for restoring vision. An ocular surface stem cell transplant from a family member would enhance the chances of success, and one of his sisters, Ikram, was found to be a perfect match. “It was unreal,” Elabdellaoui says. “It was a big sign that this might actually go well. Even though we knew it was a long way, to have my sister 100% made a big difference. To make my sister go through an operation is not something I wanted. It’s funny as my other siblings were almost upset it wasn’t them, as they wanted to be the one. It was important to have that love from my family. It did a lot to have my sister give me her cells.” Ocular stem cells from his sister and an anonymous donor were needed to allow the eye to create its own skin again and give the planned corneal transplant the best chance of working. Elabdellaoui watched across the corridor as cells were taken from his sister’s eye and walked across to him. It was the latest in a long line of surgeries, each testing his attempts to stay optimistic. “When reality hits you and you’re alone in the room and everything is still dark, then it is difficult to keep that positive mindset. Even when I was totally down and felt my life was ruined, I still kept the discipline for the task. I could have felt sorry for myself, I could have cried and got very down, but I did everything I had to do.” Among the constant treatment and checkups in Cincinnati, Elabdellaoui trained when he could to maintain fitness, despite being able to see only out of his left eye. A fitness coach at the NFL team Cincinnati Bengals, who play in the Super Bowl on Sunday, was enlisted to give sessions suitable for a wide receiver – supposedly the sport’s fittest players – but they were not intense enough. “That saved me, that kept me alive, I am not going to lie,” Elabdellaoui says. “Without that I would have not been able to survive all the way – that was my real escape. I started training early on and I put in my mind that I would be going back to play no matter what. Every time I had a really good hard session I would sweat everything out. I could feel I was still capable, strong and still alive. “Training for me was everything. I remember the few weeks when I could not train, if I had a delicate procedure or operation. They were the most difficult times and Holland understood that and would make sure I trained when I could. The training and visualising training with the team was something that kept me alive.” Galatasaray and Elabdellaoui’s Norway teammates have been very supportive, and the club have paid for his treatment. “He has a strong mentality and has been able to stay positive and see the possibilities,” Norway’s head coach, Ståle Solbakken, says. “I think the people around him have been very good at supporting him because there have been some bumps along the way where you have doubts.” From the second night in hospital to the months away from his family in America, Elabdellaoui has had one man by his side: his agent. “I don’t think there is any agent in the whole world that would do what he has done and he deserves all the praise,” Elabdellaoui says. “The accident happened and he came and slept in the hospital room with me for a month. Bear in mind this is the January transfer window, so I am really lucky and I am so thankful to have him.” Adampour was there when the corneal transplant took place in September. To get to this stage Elabdellaoui had been on a regime of drops, an anti-inflammatory diet and drinking only water for months. Holland describes Elabdellaoui as “the most motivated patient” he has seen. “His perseverance to get his vision back has inspired me and my staff,” he says. “He will jump through hoops of fire if we tell him to.” Elabdellaoui left the hospital and within an hour was removing his patch to see again. “It was really special – I do not know how to put it into words,” he says. “You can try to imagine but I do not think it is possible for anyone else who hasn’t been in the position. I was taking off the patch and had a bit of vision; I was closing my left eye and could actually see my hand on my right side; I could see all the movements on my right side that I hadn’t. It was a miracle, like a dream come true. You never think that to see is a dream – you just take that for granted.” A permanent return to the family home after more than half a year was another milestone for the right-back. “This period has given us more emotional moments than we have had all our lives, so for me to be able to come back home and see them and them to see me … there were a lot of tears, of hugs. When your only goal for nine, 10, 11 months is to see, when it’s the only thing you think about 24/7, when we were able to achieve it, that was pure happiness.” Elabdellaoui, who has to use eye drops every half an hour unless on the pitch, was reintegrated into the squad at the start of January, fitted with specialist glasses and a contact lens. His fitness regime meant he slipped back in easily. “When he returned to play it was very emotional, all the players were crying and hugging,” says Galatasaray’s Dr Yener, who has since cleared Elabdellaoui to play. Two Fridays ago Elabdellaoui featured in a friendly, which felt like his professional debut as a teenager, but his league return was delayed by Covid. He is expected to be on the bench on Saturday at home to Kayserispor and is hoping for an emotional comeback for a club with whom he now has an unbreakable bond. After a year of pain, Elabdellaoui has a career to look forward to again. “It is something that will stay with me forever,” he says. “I cannot forget. It is a scar that will be with me forever.”",Sport/Football,‘A miracle’: Omar Elabdellaoui’s road back from blindness to football,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/11/omar-elabdellaoui-road-back-from-blindness-to-football-galatasaray-miracle
2/11/2022,"It’s called Forgiveness but that’s not the keynote of Jonny Donahoe’s solo show. He calls himself a storyteller but this meditation on trauma, fear and love barely coheres into a story. Forgiveness is too fractured and unresolved for that. You have to respect Donahoe’s refusal to wrangle this raw material, addressing how new parenthood prompted a reckoning with the childhood trauma he had long run from, into a neat narrative shape. There’s a deficit in dramatic terms: the show isn’t always gripping. But you never doubt its honesty, or the hard-won nature of the truths it unfolds. Donahoe’s tale begins on a trip to San Francisco with his partner, the comedian Josie Long. Long discovers she’s pregnant; Donahoe (a musical comic himself with his band Jonny and the Baptists) has a panic attack, then locks himself in a dark room for a fortnight. Childhood, we learn, has negative connotations for Donahoe: his was blighted by abuse. Memories – some vague, some maybe even unreliable – now refuse to be stifled. Donahoe must tell his story, he says, to make moving on and becoming a father possible.  But are stories the solution or part of the problem? Forgiveness, directed by P Burton-Morgan, is much exercised by this question. A substantial portion finds Donahoe ruminating over what he is telling us and why. The show runs along twin tracks – shards of childhood memory spliced into the linear tale of Long’s pregnancy and birth – but the impact of the former on the latter is not always clear. His story of expectant fatherhood, with its trips to Ikea and deep dives into parenting literature, is not a remarkable one. Donahoe is still processing what he endured as a child. With many a brooding pause, he gives full account of his conflicted feelings and this stuff feels still raw. But there’s lightness, too, in the conversational moments when he engages the crowd, and in his reverence for his partner and their new arrival. This isn’t a perfectly constructed show, but in its intimacy and cautious hope, it is unquestionably affecting. Forgiveness is at The Point, Eastleigh, 11 February, then touring until 5 March.",Arts/Stage,Forgiveness review – new dad Jonny Donahoe returns to childhood trauma,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/11/forgiveness-review-new-dad-jonny-donahoe-old-town-hall-hemel-hempstead
2/11/2022,"The This by Adam Roberts (Gollancz, £16.99)Imagine a social media app implanted in the roof of the mouth for more immersive connectivity. This one small step turns out to be a giant leap in human evolution, a sort of telepathy that brings everyone together as parts of one vast, gestalt consciousness. But is that really such a great idea? Roberts takes a classic trope of speculative fiction, combines it with current preoccupations and views the whole in the context of religious belief and Hegelian philosophy. The result is dazzlingly inventive, exciting, funny and addictively readable.  All the White Spaces by Ally Wilkes (Titan, £8.99)This impressive debut is a vivid, immersive tale about a fictional British expedition to the Antarctic in 1919-20 – classic territory, but with a transgender perspective. The narrator is a teenage stowaway aiming to leave life as a girl behind, and begin again as Jonathan Morgan. This point of view effectively defamiliarises the standard narrative, as well as adding a layer of suspense, making for a gripping read. On top of that (although it comes halfway through the book) is the element of supernatural horror. Here, too, the author excels, creating a new sort of ghost story in the empty, icy wastes. The Embroidered Book by Kate Heartfield (HarperVoyager, £14.99)In 18th-century Europe, two little girls discover a hidden spellbook. By the time they are sent away to take up their roles as wives to foreign princes, the sisters are determined to become magisters, and use their secret powers for the good of their people. One, the new queen of Naples, achieves acceptance as the first female member of the local secret order, which jealously guards this hidden knowledge. The other, now known as Marie Antoinette, casts her lot with the people, and the rogue magisters. Heartfield has clearly done her research; the many historical figures who make up the cast of characters are depicted in convincing detail. The age of reason was also an age of secret societies, alchemists and self-styled magicians. In this absorbing novel, magic is a field of study like chemistry, but to do it takes considerable sacrifices, both physical and emotional. Focusing on two of the most famous and highly placed women in the late 18th century, Heartfield sustains a fine balance between history and fantasy. The Leviathan by Rosie Andrews (Raven, £14.99)There are so many literary historical novels that cross the border into supernatural fantasy that they are almost a genre in themselves: this haunting debut is a fine example. The plot is as surprising and sinuously twisting as the legendary sea monster of its title. In addition to the biblical references to this mysterious, powerful beast, Hobbes’s Leviathan points to a political subtext. Thomas Treadwell, an unwilling soldier in the English civil war, finds more trouble waiting for him at home, his father felled by a stroke and his sister accusing their servant of witchcraft. He considers himself a rational man, but reason alone can’t deal with a mounting death toll, and he’s forced to go for help to a distant kinsman, the poet John Milton, who eventually reveals the terrible choice he must make. More than just an entertaining fantasy, the novel offers a lesson about the importance of accepting responsibility. Echo by Thomas Olde Heuvelt (Hodder & Stoughton, £16.99)The long-awaited new novel from the Dutch author of Hex is an ambitious, capacious work referencing books by Shirley Jackson, Clive Barker, HP Lovecraft and other gothic classics. The story, which circles around the mystery of a climbing accident in the Swiss Alps, is related through a variety of manuscripts, reports, notes and recordings, most narrated by the American Sam Avery and his Dutch husband, Nick Grevers, who claims amnesia about the disappearance of his climbing partner and the accident that sheared off half of his own face. It’s a long, rambling tale, containing everything from psychological suspense to cosmic horror. With moments of wonder as well as terror, it looks likely to be one of the highlights of this year’s horror scene. They by Kay Dick (Faber, £8.99)“They” are those who distrust imagination and individuality, think books and art should be destroyed, approve of television and social housing … This “lost masterpiece” was originally published in 1977. Although there is a cool, sinister edge to the stories, they don’t add up to much; the persecuted artists are a bit too self-righteous (and privileged), and the book shows its age. Ray Bradbury’s still-relevant Fahrenheit 451 is a much more coherent treatment of the theme.",Arts/Books," The best recent science fiction, fantasy and horror – reviews roundup",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/11/the-best-recent-science-fiction-fantasy-and-horror-reviews-roundup
2/11/2022,"Booking Office 1869 lives inside St Pancras International, which is that rarest of British railway stations in that it’s a highly enjoyable one to linger in. Yes, Didcot Parkway will have its fans, but St Pancras is a destination in its own right, where splendid gothic 19th-century architecture meets shimmery luxury boutique shopping, and it’s also colonised by chic Parisians awaiting the Eurostar and enjoying the Tracey Emin light sculpture. At St Pancras, even the people clanking away on those public street pianos have a working knowledge of Ludovico Einaudi.  That said, until now, I’ve never been truly excited by St Pancras’s food offering, although the humongous Wetherspoons, The Barrel Vault, on the ground floor is never anything short of heaving. However, the recent revamp of the Booking Office – a bistro on the first floor, but also accessible via the St Pancras hotel – is interesting for several reasons. At the helm is chef Patrick Powell, who is also behind one of London’s loveliest, and possibly most underrated fine dining experiences, Allegra at The Stratford next to the Olympic Park. Powell is a unique talent, and Allegra’s menu is ever-intoxicating, mixing hearty Irish cooking with intricate French technique and tangential modernity: fried oysters with ginger and seaweed, lobster vol-au-vent with buttered leeks, and chicken in vadouvan spices with pommes Pont Neuf and pickled jalapeños, to name just three. Powell is a fan of classic cooking, but he’s also a feeder and a creator of lavish comfort food. Powell’s menu at The Booking Office 1869 is less fancy-dan, but only marginally so. Yes, there is a house burger and a caesar salad, but there is also poussin roasted over coal, monkfish curry and slow-roast lamb in chermoula. It’s a menu that’s much more ostentatious than a railway station typically deserves, and it’s made all the more gloriously incongruent by Parisian interior designer Hugo Toro’s lavish rethink of the space. Behold, the 8m palm trees and the animal-print armchairs alongside turquoise tiling, which all combine to create a style vibe I’m calling Phileas Fogg Acid-Safari chic. What’s more, the place takes its cocktail list as seriously as the Savoy’s American Bar, so if you were to order, say, an Ol’ Signalman – made from pecan-infused bourbon, Cocchi Rosa and coconut bitters – a man will appear tableside with a blowtorch and start scorching the caramelised pecan nut garnish with both aplomb and due care for your eyebrows. Yes, we are dining in a railway station, but we’re not at the Delice de France kiosk any more, people. I mean, there’s even a raw bar with Irish oysters and tuna skewers with daikon. Those skewers, incidentally, are one of the best things on the menu: top-notch fresh sashimi, all rich with white soy, miso and sesame seeds. The moment I ate it, I thought, OK, this has heavy shades of Allegra. The same goes for the dainty gildas featuring salty anchovy, an olive and a pickled chilli, while the humbly named “fried chicken” turns out to be a painstakingly boned bird, breadcrumbed, deep-fried and served with a lime-infused yoghurt dip. Of all the starters, though, don’t miss out on the cashew hummus. Yes, I know: hummus. Bad hummus is soul-zapping, but good, silky, nutty, oily hummus, such as the one here, is an emotional experience, plus it is topped with a soft-boiled egg and wisps of sliced pickled radish. A Tuscan brussels sprout salad follows with dried chicken skin, dried cranberries and fresh pecorino, all unusual partners for sprouts, which are perhaps a little al dente if you’re planning to mix in polite society afterwards. A plate of cured salmon, chopped and served tartare style, comes with a rösti, the sliced potato erected into a fabulous and delicious turbo-chip. I’ve had similar elsewhere, sure, but I will never tire of spud-based architecture. The Booking Office is not a sedate, genteel restaurant; it is a decidedly lively, slightly noisy, serious cocktail bar that’s filled with well-heeled commuters and guests from the St Pancras hotel, and that boasts one of the best menus within a two-mile radius, an area where competition is fierce yet very hit-and-miss. I couldn’t resist trying Powell’s “fried fish sandwich”, which turns out to be breadcrumbed halibut slices in a glossy steamed white bun with spicy homemade tartare containing fistfuls of gherkin; underneath the bonnet of the bun lies a thick layer of ready-salted crisps. Pudding was a slice of salted caramel tart that, while very edible, was perhaps not the most exciting or freshest I’ve ever eaten, and I still regret not opting for the rhubarb brioche doughnut with cinnamon cream. But I will go back, because it’s in St Pancras station, which I pass through several times a month, along with what feels like the rest of the planet during rush hour. I can’t guarantee that it’ll be any calmer in the Booking Office, but you’ll get properly fed and they’ll make you a very good cocktail.  Booking Office 1869 St Pancras Station, Euston Road, London NW1, 020-7841 3566. Open Tues-Sat, 4.30pm-midnight (1am Fri & Sat).

2/11/2022,"Brighton may be ninth but they are absolutely one of the hardest teams to beat this season. Only Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City have lost fewer than Brighton’s tally of four. They restart after a three-week break without Dan Burn’s significant presence but with Graham Potter’s superior coaching it is unlikely to break the spell against Watford.

2/11/2022,"Book now Having a healthy brain is crucial to our wellbeing and happiness. However, diseases of the brain and mental health are the most prevalent causes of death in the 21st century.  In this masterclass with chartered psychologist Kimberley Wilson, you will discover, through evidence-based research, the secrets to a healthy brain, and how improving your brain health can significantly strengthen your mental and emotional resilience. Beginning with an overview of prevailing attitudes and common perceptions, Kimberley will reveal how and why your brain will greatly benefit from the same attention and care as your other organs. She will share what foods and nutrients the brain needs, where these come from, and what happens when there are imbalances in our diet. She will also discuss the crucial roles that sleep and exercise play in our brain health. This masterclass is essential for anyone who wants to learn how to nourish and protect their brain, and will feature exercises for you to take part in, and simple, practical tips helping you to start embracing these new and effective habits.

2/11/2022,"Cressida Dick was “the most defensive and dismissive” leader of a British police force with problems worsening under her tenure as Scotland Yard’s commissioner, the leader of the National Black Police Association (NBPA) has said. Dick announced her departure on Thursday after a falling out with London’s mayor Sadiq Khan who lacked confidence she could improve an alleged misogynistic, racist and closed culture blighting Britain’s biggest force.  Insp Andy George, president of the NBPA, praised Dick’s decades of public service, but said it was right she stood down. George, a former firearms officer based in Northern Ireland, told the Guardian that Dick was brought down by her “achilles heel” of wanting to protect the Met’s reputation. He said the next commissioner needed to end a “culture of fear” and “toxic culture” in the Met. The ousting of Dick triggered criticism of Khan, praise for the outgoing commissioner, as well as relief that Dick’s tumultuous commissionership was coming to an end. George said: “The news that Dame Cressida Dick has resigned from leading the Metropolitan police service has come with great sadness across policing. “Her devotion to officers and staff was clear for all to see but this was ultimately her achilles heel and her desire to protect the reputation of the force has prevented the wholesale cultural reforms that are much needed. “The vast majority of police officers put on their uniform and do their best to protect the public but time and again we have seen a culture of fear within the [Met]. “A fear of challenging inappropriate behaviour and even when that behaviour is challenged, it is rarely dealt with robustly. The officer reporting discrimination can often find themselves being targeted for speaking out. “Defending the indefensible and failing to tackle the widespread issues of racism, misogyny and bullying allows bullies and poor behaviour to thrive and does a disservice to the many hardworking police officers across London and the UK. “I have the privilege of speaking to many leaders in policing and I found Dame Cressida Dick to be the most defensive and dismissive leader I meet.” However critics of Khan warned that Londoners were “less safe” as a result of Dick’s departure. Asked if Dick’s departure meant Londoners were less safe, the chair of the London assembly’s police and crime committee, Susan Hall, said it did, and pointed to the turmoil that would now follow. The mayor was wrong to have put Dick on notice, she maintained. “Ninety-nine per cent of officers are really good, very good brave officers and they have been absolutely rocked by the latest IPOC [Independent Office for Police Conduct] report into misogyny. They need confidence. They need support and to have done this in this way is completely wrong,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “It will leave a void at the top as opposed to a properly managed handover, which is no way to run a service like this, no way to run the Metropolitan police.” Last Wednesday Khan had put Dick “on notice” that she had to rapidly reform Scotland Yard or lose his support. His confidence in her was shaken to breaking point by a scandal at Charing Cross police station where officers shared racist, sexist, misogynistic and Islamophobic messages. Two of the officers investigated were promoted, while nine were left to serve in the Met. Her resignation comes less than three weeks after the Met announced a criminal inquiry into lockdown parties in Downing Street. Dick, the first female leader in the Met’s 193-year history, has led the force since 2017, with her five-year term as commissioner due to end in April this year. Her contract was extended by two years to 2024 only last September​ by the home secretary, Priti Patel, a decision endorsed by Khan. In a statement Dick made it clear she had been forced out: “It is with huge sadness that, following contact with the mayor of London today, it is clear that the mayor no longer has sufficient confidence in my leadership to continue. He has left me no choice but to step aside as commissioner of the Metropolitan police service.” Khan effectively picked Dick as commissioner in 2017, thrilled by the historic legacy of the first woman commissioner in the history of the Met, which was founded in 1829.

2/11/2022,"Harry Randall and Alex Dombrandt have been selected to start for England against Italy on Sunday with Eddie Jones ringing the changes to his side. Jones has made six changes in total with Randall, Dombrandt and Jack Nowell all starting in an eye-catching XV as England seek to get their campaign back on track. Elsewhere, Jamie George and Will Stuart come into the side, as does Charlie Ewels with Maro Itoje shifting to blindside flanker in the absence of the injured Lewis Ludlam. Tom Curry again captains the side from openside flanker with Courtney Lawes still sidelined while Ben Youngs is set to equal Jason Leonard’s England caps record of 114 assuming he comes off the bench. Leicester’s Ollie Chessum is also named among the replacements with the 21-year-old set for a debut if he comes on. Ellis Genge, Henry Slade and Luke Cowan-Dickie – who is among the replacements – have all been named as vice-captains.  Jones’s decision to select Randall at scrum-half is a show of intent from the head coach. The 24-year-old was an unused replacement against Scotland but is a livewire No 9 and caught the eye in his two previous appearances last summer, dovetailing nicely with Marcus Smith. With Dombrandt preferred to Sam Simmonds at No 8 it is an attack-minded side Jones has picked with the Harlequins back-row coming in for his first Six Nations start. Nowell, who was a late replacement against Scotland, comes on to the left wing with Joe Marchant shifting to his more familiar position of outside-centre and Elliot Daly dropping to the bench. Itoje’s move to the back-row paves the way for Ewels to join Nick Isiekwe in the second-row while the selection of George and Stuart to start will allow Jones to call on the more dynamic Cowan-Dickie and Kyle Sinckler as the game opens up against Italy. Genge keeps his place at loosehead prop while Smith, Slade, Max Malins and Freddie Steward all keep their places. Joe Marler is again on the bench with Cowan-Dickie, Sinckler, Chessum, Simmonds, Youngs, George Ford and Daly. Jones said: “We’ve set ourselves the target of playing really well and lighting up Rome. We’ve made some changes and this is the best side to face Italy. We want to start fast and take the game to them. It’s been a difficult week, but the players have bounced back well, trained hard and are ready to put on a good performance on Sunday.”",Sport/Sport,Randall and Dombrandt start as England ring Six Nations changes ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/11/harry-randall-alex-dombrandt-start-as-england-eddie-jones-ring-six-nations-changes-italy-rugby-union
2/11/2022,"Relatives and friends of the serial killer Stephen Port’s victims have welcomed Dame Cressida Dick’s resignation, saying they had no confidence in her leadership after her refusal to accept prejudice played a part in the inept police investigations into the four deaths. Sarah Sak, the mother of fashion student Anthony Walgate, 23, Port’s first victim, said: “I’m really pleased. Week in, week out the Met is in the news. It’s about time somebody came in and took control.”.  During a recent meeting with Dick, Sak said she told the commissioner that she “truly believed the officers who originally dealt with Anthony’s case were homophobic”. Sak said: “And she gave me this big long spiel about how diverse the Met is, how many gay officers, etc, etc. She just didn’t believe there was any homophobia. I felt she just paid lip service to me.” “Somebody has got to get a grip and not be a political puppet,” said Sak, whose book of her experience, A Life Stolen, is published next week. “She was in charge. She was getting paid to be in charge, and it was all crumbling around her feet. She had no option, I think, but to resign.’” A jury found Port, who fatally drug-raped victims he met on dating sites, might have been stopped sooner and lives saved but for police failings. For legal reasons, the jury was instructed it could not comment on whether prejudice, discrimination or homophobia played any part. The Met has consistently denied any prejudice. John Pape, a friend of Port’s second victim Gabriel Kovari, 22, who accused the Met of “institutional homophobia” in his evidence to the inquests, said: “I feel relieved and gratified that someone in power, Sadiq Khan, has taken decisive action. “It feels like somebody has got the message that we need radical change within the culture of the Met in order to restore confidence.” Because of the legal scope of the inquest preventing the jury from being able to consider prejudice as a factor, Pape said of Dick: “She totally hid behind that.” He claimed Dick had told a recent London Assembly meeting Pape attended that the coroner had found there was no evidence of homophobia. “That’s was my tipping point. I thought, ‘Well, she has to go.’ “It feels like her instinct is always to defend the Met from the public. But the deal is we give them powers to arrest us, to use violence against us, and in return we are supposed to feel protected. But after the experience I’ve had with the Port case, as a gay Londoner, I don’t feel protected and I wonder who does. “Their core values are supposed to be professionalism, integrity and courage. And I think by not acknowledging that prejudice played a part in the Port case, I feel she was unable to embody those values, and as such it is right that she has gone.” Pape recently attended a meeting with the LGBT+ Met police advisory group, “and there were a couple of young LGBT+ people there who said they would now not go to the police if they had a problem because they had lost faith in the Metropolitan police. That’s downright dangerous if people have lost faith to the extent that they wouldn’t report crimes to the police.” Ricky Waumsley, the partner of Port’s youngest victim, Daniel Whitworth, a chef aged 21, said he “didn’t have much faith” in Dick when he met her just before Christmas, and that she “definitely needed to go”. “There’s so much homophobic, sexist and racist stuff going on within the Met police right now. I don’t think she is capable of sorting out these issues,” he told Radio 4’s Today programme. He is calling for an investigation into the officers who handled the case to be reopened.",News/UK news,‘She paid lip service’: friends and relatives of Stephen Port’s victims on Cressida Dick,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/11/cressida-dick-stephen-port-victims-friends-relatives-met-homophobia
2/11/2022,"Every year, after the nominations for the Academy Awards are announced, our brethren at Guardian US drop their roundup of Oscarbait failures, highlighting those poor films that didn’t earn any nominations despite trying the damnedest to do so. You know the type: big stars, lavish production values, a period setting, worthy subject matter, and a sense that they have been genetically engineered to win over Academy voters.  This year, per the list, there seem to be more Oscarbait failures than ever: take your pick from Dear Evan Hansen, George Clooney’s The Tender Bar, a Mark Wahlberg drama whose existence I wasn’t aware of until 38 seconds ago, and not one but two Ridley Scott films. There’s even that most dead cert of Oscarbait dead certs: a biopic, in the form of Jennifer Hudson-starring Aretha Franklin life story Respect. Strange days indeed. Something seems to have changed among Oscar voters in recent years: the bait is being set but the Academy doesn’t seem to be gobbling it up in the same way. Instead its appetite has become more adventurous. Take the last two best picture winners: a virtuosic Korean comedy-thriller (Parasite) and an impressionistic road trip movie whose cast – bar one admittedly stellar name, and a few respected character players – was pretty much entirely made up of non-actors (Nomadland). This year’s runaway favourite, meanwhile, is Jane Campion’s brooding tale of mangled masculinity, The Power of the Dog. It has common ground with more traditional winners of the past – a garlanded director, a lead actor (Benedict Cumberbatch) seemingly hellbent on winning a best actor gong, the sort of trad period setting beloved by older Academy voters – but in other ways it feels about as far from Oscarbait as possible: too opaque, too understated and just a bit too twisted for middlebrow tastes. Yet it earned a whopping 12 nominations, as many as perhaps the definitive example of an Oscarbait movie, The King’s Speech, managed. Indeed, The Power of the Dog looks a positively safe choice when placed next to another of this year’s nominees, the Japanese drama Drive My Car – a two-hour 59-minute Murakami adaptation that muses meanderingly on death, creativity and Chekhov. Even the token blockbuster in the nominations list, Dune, feels about as arthouse-y as a blockbuster can get. This isn’t to say that more typical ‘awards-y’ films are entirely out in the cold – Belfast, for one, definitely ticks that box – but there does seem to be an interesting broadening of tastes being exhibited, most likely a result of the Academy’s decision to expand its member base, making it younger, more diverse and international. Suddenly the prospect of wins for foreign language dramas, stories you haven’t seen before on screen, or films directed by people who aren’t white blokes (should Power of the Dog win best picture it would be the first time there have been two back to back wins by women in the category) feels far more possible. And, at a time when mainstream cinema seems to be an endless procession of superhero sequels, that is something to cling on to.

2/11/2022,"Little remains of the street where Kenneth Branagh was raised. It is the day after the Oscar nominations and Branagh has professed he is “dazed and delighted” and in a “beautiful state of shock” over the seven Oscar nominations his film Belfast has received.  A BBC radio crew goes house to house to inquire about the parties planned for Oscar night. But the pickings are thin. Most of Mountcollyer Street including No 96 where Branagh grew up was demolished 10 years ago. It’s pretty much a wasteland. Buddleia competes with moss for the cracks in the street while a so-called peace wall and 3-metre-high galvanised steel fencing stretching along both sides of the road suggest dereliction and years of neglect. But the place is packed full of memories for those that remain and those who, like Branagh, moved away as the Troubles began in 1969. Fond recollections of playing on the street until dark, of running in and out of each other houses, Catholic and Protestant. But also of the intimidation, of the petrol bombs to get Catholic families “put out” of the area – all depicted in this semi-autobiographical film now destined for world acclaim. “I cried, my wife cried,” says Moore Kennedy who grew up at No 92, two doors down from the Branaghs. “When the hand-to-hand fighting started, I just sat in the cinema; the tears. I just cried. It was scary and it was reminiscent and realistic. “I didn’t see fighting in Mountcollyer Street because we moved to the Ardoyne by the time the troubles broke out, but I saw fighting there too. And it was just like in the film.” Like Branagh he moved permanently to England, a journey many of his generation underwent. “It was like going from hell to heaven,” he says. An older woman who lived four doors up from the Branaghs is initally reluctant to chat. She doesn’t want to revist the past but has heard all about the film. “That was the way it was back then. It was terrible. There was violence on both sides. People were told to ‘get out’ of their houses. And you just did what you were told. You were just glad you weren’t shot or kneecapped,” says Marilyn. “I remember from my bedroom window seeing a large group of men who had barricaded the soldiers against the fence and throwing stones and petrol bombs. I just thought: ‘Is this real life or am I watching a movie?’” Those who did not live through the troubles or in Northern Ireland will have little understanding of the horrors of what many think was a civil war. “I worked in town in Donegall Street and a bomb went off,” Marilyn says, remembering an IRA atrocity in 1972. “A bin lorry just came and they were throwing bits of legs and stuff into it. I couldn’t go and watch that film.” Not everything is a faithful representation of Branagh’s childhood street, which was recreated on a studio set in England because of Covid restrictions during filming in 2020. In real life there was just one side to the street, recalled 92-year-old Peggy who lived a few doors away from Branagh. The terrace of red bricks was a mixture of “kitchen houses”, local slang for two-up two-downs with outdoor toilets, that Branagh’s grandparents lived in and the bigger “parlour houses” including No 96, that had sitting rooms and indoor toilets. A mural of Northern Ireland’s second most famous footballer Danny Blanchflower is also a forgotten memory or fiction for most. When Kennedy was small it bore the words: “Sexy girls wear frilly knickers”. “I remember it very well because I didn’t understand what ‘sexy’ was and I remember asking my mother. She told me it meant ‘girls who were not married’,” he recalls. For some it is a glimpse of the poverty as well as the violence of the time that Branagh has got spot on. “There’s a scene when someone is there sitting on the toilet having a cup of tea and chatting and there’s newspaper hanging on the wall. My granda used to do that. He would cut out the newspaper in triangles and hang it on a butcher’s hook and that was the toilet roll,” says Clara Stratton, whose mother was first cousin of Branagh’s mother Frances Harper. They lived 2 miles away and she says the sectarianism was the same. “I thought the movie was so sad. We had Catholic families that were also ‘put out’. Neighbours rallied round and told them they were not to go, just like in the film, but the people who’d come for them would come from another part of town. How to blessed God did we live in those days. It was just unbelievable,” she says. Branagh has said the film was not an autobiography but inspired by his memories and “a look at a people and a place in tumult” through the eyes of Buddy, the central character of the movie at nine-years-old, the same age as Branagh when his parents moved to England.",Arts/Film,‘I just cried’: film stirs memories on Belfast street Branagh left behind,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/11/i-just-cried-film-stirs-memories-on-belfast-street-branagh-left-behind
2/11/2022,"Today in a nutshell: We said farewell to Shaun White, Lara Gut-Behrami finally got a medal, Nils van der Poel smashed a world record and Irene Schouten is hopefully having a nice rest after destroying the field in the speed skating late yesterday Next up: There’s more curling and ice hockey today, and then tomorrow we can anticipate the US v Canada in the men’s ice hockey  After his final Olympics appearance retiring snowboarding legend Shaun White said of the younger generation: “I don’t want to beat these guys anymore. I want to sponsor them.” White first won Olympic gold when aged 19 in 2006. This year’s gold went to Japan’s Ayumu Hirano. Australia’s Scotty James took silver, while Switzerland’s Jan Scherrer took the bronze. “I just tried to ski today, nothing more, nothing less,” Switzerland’s Lara Gut-Behrami said when asked if her previous near misses had played on her mind. “Sometimes that’s the problem: we just try to think too much and try to do something different at the Olympics.” The 30-year-old won gold today in the women’s super-G after two consecutive agonising fourth-placed finishes at previous Games. Her compatriot Michelle Gisin took bronze, Austria’s Mirjam Puchner was second, 0.22 seconds behind Gut-Behrami. Mikaela Shiffrin finished ninth after failing to finish in either of her two previous races in Beijing. On the endurance side of things, Finland’s Iivo Niskanen dominated the men’s 15km classic cross country. He finished just over 23 seconds ahead of Alexander Bolshunov of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC). Marte Olsbu Roeiseland won gold for Norway in the women’s 7.5km biathlon. The future of 15-year-old Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva remains in limbo despite the Independent Testing Agency confirming that she tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine on Christmas Day. Whether she is allowed to compete or not – along with whether the Russian team can keep its team gold – is still being contested in a courtroom. Irene Schouten is just a phenomenon on ice. Yesterday she added the 5,000m speed skating gold to her earlier 3,000m victory, 4.67 seconds ahead of Canada’s Isabelle Weidemann. It wasn’t just a second gold – it was a second Olympic record in the space of a few days, breaking a mark that was set in Salt Lake City by Claudia Pechstein 20 years ago. Nils van der Poel of Sweden was also a record-breaker, setting a new world fastest time in the men’s 10,000m as he took a second gold of these Games. Things you might have missed The mixed teams aerials final in the freestyle skiing yesterday went to the US, with China in second and Canada third. There was no surprise in the result of the first quarter-final of the women’s ice hockey, as the US progressed 4-1 at the expense of the Czech Republic. However, the Czech team had taken the lead, and once again the US women unleashed attack after attack without scoring prolifically. “You’ve just got to keep shooting – doesn’t matter how many shots you’ve taken, one’s going to go in,” four-time Olympian Hilary Knight said after the match. “These goalies are great at this level and we really have to challenge them.” If it is the luge, then it is probably a gold medal for Germany. The team relay competition yesterday was no different. Reality bites for China’s ice hockey ringers on Winter Olympic debut ITA confirms Russia’s Kamila Valieva tested positive for banned substance Team GB’s struggles go on with problems for skeleton crew Australia’s Scotty James wins silver medal in snowboard halfpipe There’s a relentless amount of curling going on.

In the men’s, Sweden are unbeaten after three, and Canada have a 100% record after their two games. Times are all in local Beijing time.

2/11/2022,"From oral contraceptives to proposals to edit their DNA, efforts to control the UK’s invasive grey squirrel population have become increasingly elaborate. But a growing number of chefs and conservationists have a far simpler idea, which they see as part of the trend in ethical dining: eat them. “My original starting point with grey squirrel was taste. But it’s also great for the environment,” says Paul Wedgwood, one of Scotland’s leading chefs, whose restaurant on Edinburgh’s Royal Mile has had grey squirrel on the menu since 2008. Wedgwood has even made haggis from the North American rodent that has driven the local extinction of the native red across much of England and Wales.  “It’s mellow, nutty and a bit gamey. It’s just a really nice flavour, and it’s easy to match. Anyone who’s doing rabbit could just easily swap in squirrel,” he says. Wedgwood is not alone among chefs putting invasive species on the menu. At Dai Due restaurant in Austin, Texas, owner and chef Jesse Griffiths is encouraging Americans to hunt and eat more of the millions of feral hogs that cause billions of dollars of damage to farmland. In the Bahamas, Michelin-starred chef José Andrés is serving up invasive lionfish to help protect reefs in the Caribbean. At Fallow in London, chefs are planning to cook king crab, the latest arrival on British shores that has sparked fears for native brown crab and scallop populations. The concept of “invasivorism” was developed more than two decades ago by Joe Roman, a conservation biologist at the University of Vermont. “With this idea, humans are a form of biological control. Humans are amazing predators: whether it’s eating the grey squirrel in Britain or the European green crab in the US, we know eating them can have an impact on populations,” he says. The spread of invasive species counts among the major drivers of extinctions and biodiversity loss on Earth, according to leading scientists. Not all non-native organisms become invasive, but those that do spread rapidly and outcompete native wildlife, often due to the absence of predators, causing financial and ecological damage. Examples include mice on Gough Island in the south Atlantic where the rodents eat albatross chicks in their nests, and the Burmese python in Florida’s Everglades, which has devastated mammal populations. Invasive species are also expensive: a Queen’s University Belfast study revealed this week that they have caused £878bn of damage worldwide since the 1960s, a bill set to spiral this century. Roman runs the website EatTheInvaders.org, hosting recipes for invasive species in the US that include the green iguana, wakame seaweed and nutria or coypu – a river rat. “We need to say from the beginning that the goal is to reduce these populations – not to create a market for them. We don’t want people to say ‘wow, this crayfish is really good. I wish we had it in this river system’ or something like that,” Roman says. “In this time of globalisation, we’re moving animals, plants and fungi around all the time that have ecological impacts. We are trying to work against that.” Critics are wary of how effective invasivorism can be at achieving its aims, with evidence the “eat them to beat them” approach can have the opposite effect for some species. A 2020 paper on catching invasive signal crayfish populations in North Yorkshire, where Britain’s only native crayfish is being driven out, found that traps were likely ineffective and helped spread the crayfish. Despite the crayfish being promoted by chefs including Gordon Ramsay, the report found that less than 2.5% of invasive crayfish were large enough to be caught in traditional traps, which could harm other creatures. Then there is the question of scale. The Wild Meat Company, which sells game from Suffolk, England, sold about 10,000 grey squirrels last year, hardly enough to dent the population of 2.7 million in the UK. In the US, a 2014 review found that while eating invasive species can reduce populations and raise public awareness, it might inadvertently provide disincentives to their eradication. It offered an 11-point strategy for using invasivorism effectively, along with following local laws on harvesting species, which differ around the world. While proponents acknowledge it is not possible to turn all invasive flora and fauna into gourmet food, they say that taste is key to success. At Miya’s, a sustainable sushi restaurant in New Haven, Connecticut, head chef Bun Lai developed a dedicated invasive species menu and won the White House champions of change award in 2016 for his sustainable food. “If we ate invasive animals such as boar and nutria instead of cows, we would have a significant impact on climate change because of their greenhouse gas emissions,” says Lai, who now runs sustainable sushi pop-ups after the closure of the restaurant in 2021. “From a swamp rodent called nutria to python, poisonous cane toad and a plethora of invasive plants, I have hunted, fished and foraged many invasive species. People’s tastes are constantly changing,” he says. “In my sushi platters for decades, I’d include non-conventional ingredients. Rather than tuna, farmed salmon, eel, and yellowtail, I’d use invasive carp with black soldier fly larvae, invasive blue catfish, invasive lionfish, edible weeds, invasive plants, and organic vegetables and fruit. For years, people would tell me every day that the sushi I was making wasn’t sushi, but over time it became more accepted.” In the UK, time will tell whether Japanese knotweed vodka and muntjac deer burgers become part of the measures to limit invasive species. Not all invasive animals are classed as game, and therefore the public is not free to shoot, trap and consume every invasive species. But for fine diners in Scotland, grey squirrel, which it is legal to kill humanely, is already a firm favourite. “The demand is there from customers,” says Wedgwood. “I had a guy fly in from Switzerland who ordered a squirrel tasting menu. A six-course menu … just with squirrel!” Recipe by Paul Wedgwood. Serves 2 2 squirrel racks – room temperature2 jersey royal potatoes1 clove garlic1 sprig rosemary500ml goose fat1 large carrot50g butter, diced in small pieces2 wild garlic leaves50ml oilSalt and pepper Peel the potatoes and gently fry in a little goose fat to add colour. Transfer to a small saucepan, add the garlic and rosemary and enough goose fat to cover the potatoes. Place on a medium heat. Bring the fat to a simmer, reduce the heat and gently simmer for about 30 minutes or until the potatoes are soft and cooked through. Peel the carrot and slice. Place in a small pan with a little salt and cover with water. Bring to the boil and cook until the carrot is soft. Drain and reserve the cooking liquor. Using a hand blender, blitz the carrot with the diced butter and season with salt and white pepper. Adjust the consistency if required with the cooking liquor and leave somewhere warm. Blitz the wild garlic with the oil and pass through a fine sieve. In a small frying pan, take two spoonfuls of the potato confit fat and heat until it is just beginning to smoke. Turn the heat down slightly and carefully add the squirrel racks and baste for about two minutes. Remove the racks from the pan, season with salt and pepper, and leave somewhere warm. Add a spoonful of the carrot puree to a plate, remove the potatoes from the fat and place on an absorbent cloth for a few seconds. Season with salt, then add to the plate. Place the squirrel rack on top and drizzle with wild garlic oil.

2/11/2022,"Good morning. President Joe Biden has urged Americans in Ukraine to immediately leave the country, stressing that “things could go crazy quickly” as Russia-Ukraine relations further deteriorate.  “American citizens should leave, should leave now,” Biden said in an interview with NBC News. “We’re dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. This is a very different situation and things could go crazy quickly.” Russia and Ukraine said on Thursday night in Berlin that no breakthrough had been achieved after a day of talks with French and German officials. Talks between the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and her Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, also failed to make progress. Why was there no breakthrough? Russia and Ukraine continued to hold different interpretations of the 2015 Minsk agreement aimed at ending the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, said the Russian envoy Dmitry Kozak. How quickly could Russia launch an attack? Moscow has gathered more than 135,000 soldiers on Ukraine’s borders in Russia and Belarus, military analysts say. Some believe nearly all the key elements are in now place for an attack. The US has urged Canada to use federal powers to end the protest blockade of the Ambassador Bridge, where protesters opposed to vaccine mandates are causing deeping economic disruption. The “Freedom Convoy” of truckers opposed to a vaccinate-or-quarantine mandate for cross-border drivers began blocking North America’s busiest international land border crossing on Monday. The US homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, and the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, urged the Canadian government “to use federal powers to resolve this situation at our joint border”. The mayor of Windsor, Ontario, Drew Dilkens, said that police near the Ambassador Bridge had begun receiving reinforcements, saying: “[If] the protesters don’t leave, there will have to be a path forward,” he told CNN. “If that means physically removing them, that means physically removing them, and we’re prepared to do that.” What else is being done to end the blockade? Windsor is seeking an injunction from Ontario superior court to have the protest ended, Dilkens said, adding he continues to search for a peaceful resolution. What are the protesters demanding? As the “Freedom Convoy” protest in Ottawa enters its third week, the movement has broadened to demand an end to all Covid public health measures. Far-right conspiracy theory movement QAnon appears to have begun a nationwide attempt to seize control of the US election process in key swing states ahead of the 2024 election. At least 15 candidates associated with the movement, which maintains the lie that the 2020 election was “stolen” from Donald Trump, are running to serve as chief election officials in crucial battleground states. At least eight of them are working in coalition, sharing tactics and ideas on how to radically reshape the election system. “This is the way that QAnon could trigger a constitutional crisis,” said Alex Kaplan, senior researcher at the watchdog Media Matters for America who is a close observer of the conspiracy theory. “QAnon is linked to an effort to recruit and elect candidates to positions directly controlling election administrations, and given their ties to harming democracy, that is very concerning.” How could the candidates subvert democracy? If any are elected, they would be in a strong position to distort or even overturn state election results in favour of their preferred candidate, which could sway the national result. Federal protections for gray wolves have been restored in much of the US after being scrapped during the Trump administration. Wildlife advocates have hailed it as a significant conservation success, while the move has angered livestock farmers. Jerry Harris, the former star of the Netflix documentary series Cheer, has pleaded guilty to federal charges of receiving child sexual abuse images and soliciting sex from minors. Harris, 22, pleaded guilty to two of seven felony counts against him and is scheduled to be sentenced on 28 June. The spread of the mysterious Havana syndrome has seriously affected US morale and ability to recruit diplomats, the head of the American Foreign Service Association has said. Recruits are asking whether the government would provide for them if they became ill with the syndrome, which involves long-term loss of balance and cognitive function. The number of abortions carried out by registered practitioners in Texas dropped by 60% within a month of the state passing the most restrictive abortion law seen in decades, new figures show. The law, which bans the procedure once cardiac activity is detected and makes no exception for incest or rape, has forced some patients to travel hundreds of miles to clinics in other states, resulting in a backlog of appointments in some places. Despite the continued threat of radiation that persists 35 years after the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, refugees displaced by the eight-year conflict in the Donbas region have moved into abandoned housing near the forbidden zone. Photojournalist Gaëlle Girbes documents the lives of Ukrainians seeking refuge in a largely deserted area with almost no infrastructure and no jobs. After Simon Curtis found a tiny tree frog in a box of lettuce while preparing a salad, he did what any concerned pet-owner-to-be would do: asked Twitter for advice. His phone blew up with people invested in the story, and after consulting a frog specialist, he decided the best option was to keep the animal, which he named Tony, as a pet. Curtis describes him as living “a chill existence … He’s mischievous, incorrigible and precious.” First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.
