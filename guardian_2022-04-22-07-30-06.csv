4/22/2022,"Barcelona ground out a feisty 1-0 win at Real Sociedad on Thursday, returning to second in the La Liga table and putting Monday’s home defeat to Cádiz behind them. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s early strike helped Xavi’s side tighten their grip on a top-four place, opening an eight-point gap over Sociedad in sixth. The Gabon forward struck after 11 minutes, heading home Ferran Torres’ cross after Ousmane Dembélé had struck the post. That was the first goal the hosts had conceded at the Anoeta since mid-December and la Real quickly set about making amends, with Alexander Isak dragging a shot wide of the far post. In the second half, Marc-André ter Stegen denied Alexander Sørloth twice, while Gavi missed a chance to seal victory on the break. Sevilla are in third place after holding on for a hard-fought 3-2 victory at lowly Levante. Jesús Corona scored his first goal for the club with a header, then got a second with a fine lob from Lucas Ocampos’ pass after the home captain, José Luis Morales, had levelled from the penalty spot. In the second half, Levante had a golden opportunity to equalise when Marcos Acuña conceded another spot-kick, but this time Morales sent the ball wide. Jules Koundé headed home from a corner to extend Sevilla’s lead, with Roberto Soldado’s late goal only a consolation as the hosts stayed six points from safety. Cádiz fell back to earth after their Camp Nou victory as Athletic Bilbao raced into a three-goal lead. Raúl García grabbed the opener from close range, with Iker Muniain scoring the rebound after his penalty was saved. Mikel Vesga added a third from the edge of the box with 33 minutes played, and Iñaki Williams saw his effort ruled out for offside just before the break. The hosts rallied in the second half, with substitute Lucas Pérez pouncing on an Unai Simón error with 35 minutes to go. Vesga was sent off 15 minutes later, but Rubén Sobrino’s late second proved too late as Athletic won 3-2. Elsewhere, Rayo Vallecano halted their slide down the table with a vital 1-0 win at Espanyol – their first away victory in the league since September.",Sport/Football,"La Liga: Barcelona bounce back at Real Sociedad, Sevilla hold off Levante",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/la-liga-real-sociead-barcelona-sevilla-roundup
4/22/2022,"There is an undoubted sense in which new Channel 4 series Chivalry, co-written by and co-starring Steve Coogan and Sarah Solemani, asks the question, “What if Alan Partridge were a successful Hollywood producer in the post-#MeToo era?” This is a question worth asking, especially when the answers are as good and funny and deft as they are here. Coogan plays Cameron, a fairly (one imagines) typical film producer. He’s just coming out of another relationship with a twentysomething partner who was his assistant. He has slept with the leading lady he is now trying to persuade to reshoot scenes from his latest project. And he is just bright enough to know he’s being left behind as this strange, new landscape emerges, but not bright enough to know how to adapt to it. When Bobby (Solemani), the indie darling who has been brought in to detoxify the project poisoned by its European old-guard director, shouts “Sorry!” as she rushes off mid-conversation, because a call about her son comes through, he shouts back: “Never apologise for being a mother!” It’s the perfect amount of wrongness that Partridge made his own. But, if, in the portrait of a man applying limited intelligence to matters of deep import, Chivalry plays to Coogan’s greatest strengths, it is still so much more. The programme grew out of the real-life sparring over feminism and the need for change that went on between Coogan and Solemani when they were working on the 2019 film Greed, as the wave of the #MeToo movement began to break against Hollywood’s shores. And the show is filled with complexity and nuance instead of didacticism or simple satirisation of past excesses and the overcorrections that come with the new era. Bobby welcomes input from Cameron’s new assistant Ama (Lolly Adefope) on the sex scene she has to reshoot, but moves swiftly on when Ama reckons it would be empowering to have the leading lady (Lark, played by Sienna Miller) be “a squirter”. But she and Bobby unite later to embarrass Cameron as they rework the scene to make it sexy for women as well as men. “Let’s see her get her pussy ready!” says Bobby. “You want to see the vagina?” says Cameron, faintly – beautifully – appalled. “It’s not technically a vagina,” says Bobby. There’s a brief pause in which you can hear a thousand thoughts and questions, and resistance to asking any one of them crumbling, and Cameron says, with reluctant defiance: “What is it then?” Bobby and Ama school him thoroughly, basically bouncing his balls back and forth effortlessly between them. The phrases “muscular canal” and “longitudinal folds” are used while Cameron looks ever closer to death. It’s very funny. Folded into the main theme – the labia minora to the labia majora of systemic sexism, if you will – is the tendency of power to corrupt. Cameron bemoans the introduction of compulsory intimacy supervisors on set. “Do you want to know why they’re compulsory now?” says Bobby. “Because the men who had the power to stop women being abused chose not to. The environment created was just so hostile and toxic and predatory and disgusting that intimacy supervisors were created to spell out what should be obvious.” “Right,” says Cameron. Written down, it sounds heavy, but delivered by Solemani, as light and dry as a touchpaper, it is hilarious at the same time as being immensely satisfying. I mean, isn’t that the absolute heart of the matter? That we – women, activists, legislators and so, almost infinitely on – are all working simply to enact everything that should be obvious? Still, as the episodes and the reshoots go on, Bobby is driven to sideline intimacy supervisor Tatiana – a new focus for Cameron’s attentions and a wonderful turn from Aisling Bea – who drags down the whole production with her overindulgence of the male actor (“Would it help if you thought of your characters as animals?”). He in turn doesn’t feel safe during the sex scene with Lark, who is herself eyerolling so hard at this new world order that she almost falls off the bed. Bobby tells Cameron to distract Tatiana so she can get the actor to undress. “I don’t care how that sounds.” Chivalry is a quality, precision-engineered piece of work by a duo with extraordinary chemistry, both on- and off-screen, in the writers’ room. Add Adefope and her immaculate timing (and delivery almost as dry as Solemani’s), Wanda Sykes as the manipulative powerhouse studio executive, and occasional impeccably daft cameos from the likes of Paul Rudd (“One of the most unpleasant people I’ve ever met,” says Cameron) and, unlike any of Cameron’s former assistants and most of his leading ladies, you have no cause for complaint.",Arts/Television & radio,Chivalry review – Steve Coogan and Sarah Solemani’s immensely satisfying #MeToo comedy,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/21/chivalry-review-steve-coogan-and-sarah-solemani-immensely-satisfying-metoo-comedy
4/22/2022,"It is immediately clear that Punchdrunk’s new immersive show is a massive endeavour. It resembles a gallery of antiquities on arrival: there are snaking queues, phased entrances for crowd control and a row of ancient vases, libation bowls and headdresses in glass displays. The promenade show, a modern enactment of life in the ancient fallen city of Troy, is arranged across three Grade II-listed buildings, which comprise the company’s new home, and 54 performers portray 28 characters. We are instructed to don beaked masks before entering a cavernous maze of rooms, corridors and floors. Walking whichever way we choose, we come across performers who dance in what seem like ritualistic ways; others cry, writhe, or hold their heads in their hands, all playing Trojans mourning their losses, it seems. The beaked masks give us a look of predation and as we crowd around the actors we appear like rampaging voyeurs in the ruins of this city. The signs of flight – unfinished jigsaws, washing left to dry, feasts laid out – are poignant. We touch these abandoned things as we go by. The immense space and its immersive elements are impressive – we really feel as if we are in a bombed-out city, travelling through its grime and crumbling grandeur. Even the bar is immersive, with its own Cabaret-style decadent and risque performances, with magnificent singing by Kimberly Nichole. The set, designed by Felix Barrett, Livi Vaughan and Beatrice Minns with attention to the smallest detail, has an intimate filmic beauty. The doom-laden sound design by Stephen Dobbie is a permanent accompaniment, occasionally building to adrenalised trance music. There is a phenomenal lighting design by F9, Ben Donoghue and Barrett (from shadow-play to showers of celestial light) and stylishly modern gothic costumes by David Israel Reynoso (black bodysuits and basques, gold jewellery and feather boas). All these elements evoke atmosphere and give this show its “wow” factor. But it comes to feel like an elaborate on-site installation rather than an enveloping human drama. The stagecraft is the main event. Directed by Barrett and Maxine Doyle, The Burnt City is an epic set-up without enough epic storytelling. Aeschylus’s Agamemnon and Euripides’s Hecuba are the source texts but where ancient Greek tragedy classically relies on words and songs, this production employs mime, movement and dance. A few actors speak but their words are barely audible. They are all intense, agile performers, especially Sarah Dowling’s Hecuba and Jordan Ajadi’s Polymestor, who she blinds in a dance that looks like a techno rave. This scene is repeated over the course of the performance, as if on a hellish loop. There are slow scenes of pained choreography by Doyle: a man sits in a greenhouse holding a plant; tarpaulin is laid out on which to drag a dead body away; tormented mortals appear to be comforted by Gods. These conjure the despairing aftermath of battle but feel like snatches of moments, their stories sometimes arcane. Set against the dramatic impact of the music and lighting, they look like the teasing excerpts of a movie trailer – not the movie itself. There is an increasingly exhausting feeling in this three-hour show of moving around the circuit of rooms in search of more performers, more story. Some of the longer and more dynamic scenes, when they come, are enthralling. In the most powerful moment a group of men move towards a desperate huddle of Trojan women, one of whom is strung up, half-naked and bloodied. The terror and tragedy – of female sacrifice and male violation – pervades the vast room, which looks like a gladiator’s ring. It could be a scene from Pat Barker’s magnificent and horrifying The Silence of the Girls, though it uses no words. Its emotional power lands like a punch and shows us that this company can orchestrate fantastically potent human theatre. So it is frustrating that they do not build more of it into the production. That said, those who are satisfied with spectacle above story will enjoy this meticulously crafted show. Those of us who come for meaty drama and narrative momentum may leave hungry. The Burnt City is at One Cartridge Place, London, until 4 December.",Arts/Stage,Punchdrunk: The Burnt City review – spectacle eclipses story in siege of Troy epic,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/21/punchdrunk-the-burnt-city-review
4/22/2022,"Sheryl Sandberg, the Meta executive, allegedly pressured the Daily Mail to drop unflattering stories about her then-boyfriend Bobby Kotick, the Activision Blizzard CEO, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. The Journal reports that she persuaded the digital edition of the Mail not to run stories revealing that an ex-girlfriend of Kotick had obtained a temporary restraining order against him in 2014. Kotick reportedly said that Sandberg, who he dated for three years until 2019, told the Mail in 2016 that if the article were published, it could damage the outlet’s relationship with Facebook. Sandberg allegedly contacted the Daily Mail in 2016 and 2019 to put a stop to the articles, and both times the stories never ran. According to the Wall Street Journal’s reporting, Meta and Activision employees were involved in Sandberg’s effort to kill the story, as well as outside advisers. Facebook is investigating whether Sandberg violated internal rules, the Journal reported, but a spokesperson denied the allegations. “Sheryl Sandberg never threatened the MailOnline’s business relationship with Facebook in order to influence an editorial decision. This story attempts to make connections that don’t exist,” said Mao-Lin Shen, a Meta spokesperson. Some Facebook executives believe any effort by Sandberg to stop a news article could have been seen as a threat given her powerful role at the company, the Journal reported. Advisers to Sandberg were reportedly worried the news of a restraining order against Kotick could damage the Meta executive’s reputation as a champion for women. Sandberg has positioned herself as an advocate for women in the workplace, writing the 2013 book Lean In, which encourages women “sit at the table” and seek challenges to advance in their careers. In 2014, according to the court documents reviewed by the Journal, Kotick allegedly traveled to the home of an ex-girlfriend uninvited, harassing her after she had broken up with him because of his “bullying and controlling nature”. The incident prompted her to obtain a temporary restraining order, which lasted about three weeks. In a statement, Kotick told the Journal that its reporting was inaccurate, and that he never said Sandberg threatened the Daily Mail. Instead, Kotick said, the Mail chose not to run the story because it was not true. Kotick’s ex-partner who took out the restraining order echoed his statement that the allegations she once made against him were untrue. “I told the Wall Street Journal that what I said 8 years ago about Bobby was false. It is still false. In fact, in 2014, I signed a sworn statement making clear that what I had said about Bobby was untrue” she said in a statement that her attorney provided to the Guardian. Kotick has been heavily criticized in recent months over accusations that he was aware of “many incidents of sexual harassment, sexual assault and gender discrimination at Activision Blizzard”. The company has faced multiple sexual harassment lawsuits and was sued by California over its workplace culture, which a state agency described as “a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women”. A group of shareholders accused Kotick of failing either “to ensure that the executives and managers responsible were terminated or to recognize and address the systematic nature of the company’s hostile workplace culture”. The Activision Blizzard board of directors said in a statement that it has been aware of the incident since 2014, and that Kotick had been “fully transparent” to the board. “The board, through its counsel Skadden Arps, has done a thorough examination of the facts and circumstances of the events, satisfied itself that there was no merit to the allegations, and notes that they concern a personal relationship that has nothing to do with the business of the Company. The board continues to have full confidence in Mr Kotick’s leadership and his ability to run the company,” it said in a statement to the Guardian. The Daily Mail did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Guardian.",News/Technology,Sheryl Sandberg allegedly leant on news site to drop stories about ex-boyfriend,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/21/sheryl-sandberg-meta-daily-mail-bobby-kotick-activision
4/22/2022,"Florida legislators passed a bill on Thursday that would revoke Walt Disney Co’s special tax status in a move widely seen as tit-for-tat for the company’s opposition to a new “don’t say gay” state law limiting discussion of LGBTQ+ issues in schools. The bill now heads to the desk of Governor Ron DeSantis, who is all but guaranteed to sign it. The Republican-led state house in Florida voted 70-38 to do away with a special tax district created by a 1967 law that allows Disney to self-govern the roughly 25,000-acre Orlando area where its Walt Disney World theme park complex is located. The state Senate passed the measure on Wednesday. DeSantis, in a surprise move, had asked lawmakers to consider the legislation during a special session he called this week. He did not immediately comment on the bill’s passage on Thursday. “If Disney wants to pick a fight, they chose the wrong guy,” DeSantis wrote in an email to supporters on Wednesday, adding, “I will not allow a woke corporation based in California to run our state.” The law would eliminate a handful of special tax districts including the Reedy Creek Improvement District that covers about 25,000 acres in Orange and Osceola counties. That structure makes Disney, one of the state’s largest private employers, and other landowners responsible for providing services such as firefighting, power, water and roads. They in turn get relief from taxes and fees. The change would go into effect in June 2023. In a statement to CNN, the Democratic state representative Fentrice Driskell said, “It’s going to cost the government in Orange county and Osceola counties and therefore the taxpayers billions of dollars, I’m talking an additional tax burden that’s estimated $2,200 to $2,800 per family.” Disney came under fire last month by many in the LGBTQ+ community, including some Disney employees, for initially failing to take a public stand against the “don’t say gay” measure, then condemned the legislation and said it would pause all its political donations in Florida. That set off a storm of condemnation against the company by many Republicans. DeSantis, a Republican who is a potential candidate for his party’s 2024 presidential nomination, wants to strike back at Disney for its opposition to a law that bans classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity for students in kindergarten through third grade. The governor signed the legislation, dubbed the “don’t say gay” bill by opponents, last month. The law, which is to take effect on 1 July, also prohibits such teaching that “is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate” for older students. It is being challenged in court.",News/US news,Disney to lose special tax status for opposing Florida’s ‘don’t say gay’ bill,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/21/florida-disney-dont-say-gay
4/22/2022,"Burnley started life at Turf Moor without Sean Dyche by selecting a classic 4-4-2 formation made up of players their former manager brought to the club, but this was a different team from the one that lost 2-0 at Norwich less than two weeks ago. Southampton could not cope with the liberated hosts, who gave themselves hope once again of beating the drop. Goals from Connor Roberts and Nathan Collins put a revitalised Burnley in control of their first home contest without Dyche at the helm for almost a decade. The victory leaves them one point behind Everton and safety having played a game more, but with a marginally better goal difference. In a carefully poised season, such things could be decisive. Their caretaker manager, Mike Jackson, has secured four points from his two games in charge but does not know if he will be in the dugout when Wolves visit on Sunday. “I think the players and the group have remembered who they are, what they are good at and what they are capable of,” Jackson said. “It’s as simple as that. We are here to guide them – the staff have all mucked in, everyone’s played their part. I don’t buy into this magic wand thing, I am not reinventing the wheel here. This is a group of guys here who have come together and are fighting.” There was no mourning the departure of Dyche in the stands. Instead supporters focused their efforts on vociferously backing a team in need of a win. They were, however, almost silenced inside seven minutes when Kyle Walker-Peters cut in from the right into space and hit a shot that was deflected over. The resulting James Ward-Prowse corner was attacked by an unmarked Oriol Romeu, who headed wide from six yards to provide a much-needed wake-up to Burnley. The dynamic of the match changed when Burnley’s first attack concluded with the right-back Roberts receiving a pass 20 yards from goal. Space was given to a man whose most recent club goal came almost a year ago, allowing him to move the ball on to his left foot and perfectly curl a shot round Fraser Forster into the corner to make everyone inside Turf Moor forget their troubles. Jackson was mobbed on the touchline by his makeshift backroom staff, including the club captain, Ben Mee. The opener ignited an aggression inside Burnley who saw their opportunity to attack a Southampton side lacking thrust. Maxwel Cornet took the ball and slipped a pass through for Wout Weghorst, who shimmied before striking at goal but the legs of Forster kept his effort out. Weghorst was then picked out by a Dwight McNeil cross, which was headed down and ended up with a snapshot from Jay Rodriguez that was repelled by Forster’s quick reactions, proving why he has earned an England recall. “When you concede the goal with the first chance from then and then after this don’t win any duels until half-time, you don’t deserve to win, because we have been lacking in everything in the first 15 minutes and it’s simply not good enough today,” Ralph Hasenhüttl said. Burnley were the ones eventually rewarded from a corner as Collins got above Ward-Prowse to leave Forster helpless on the stroke of half-time. VAR took a long look to see if an offside Jack Cork was interfering with play but ultimately granted the goal, much to the relief of the home fans. The liberation of Burnley’s full-backs did create gaps to be exploited on the counter, but the determination of those in claret ensured Southampton could not make the most of their opportunities when Roberts or Charlie Taylor were found at the other end of the pitch. There were also more errant passes than in the Dyche era but this could be put down to the greater ambition when in possession, something the crowd appreciated rather than moaned about when the ball went astray. Rodriguez and Cork sheepishly wheeled away to celebrate a potential third goal after Forster had palmed a James Tarkowski header against the duo as they simultaneously clattered into the goalkeeper. Sadly for Burnley, Cork was deemed to be interfering with play on this occasion as he stood inches in front of Rodriguez, causing VAR to upset the home support. In the final moments there were chants from the stands of “There’s only one Sean Dyche” for their departed manager. The fans will be back on Sunday for the visit of Wolves as the team look to honour Dyche’s legacy with survival, but on their own terms.",Sport/Football,Burnley boost survival hopes as Connor Roberts sparks sinking of Southampton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/burnley-southampton-premier-league-match-report
