1/10/2022,"Novak Djokovic has won a battle with the Australian government after a court quashed the decision to cancel his visa – but he may still yet lose the war. No sooner had federal circuit judge Anthony Kelly revealed the home affairs minister had agreed to settle the case, than the Australian government’s counsel warned the immigration minister could still decide to use a personal power to cancel Djokovic’s visa anew.  That means that Alex Hawke, one of the closest political allies of prime minister Scott Morrison, now has a momentous political decision to make: let Djokovic stay and play for a record 21st grand slam singles title; or deport him, which comes with a hefty three-year ban from re-entering Australia. The harsh border policies that have allowed Australian governments to detain asylum seekers indefinitely are now being directed at one unvaccinated man, who happens to be the world’s No 1 ranked male tennis player. Djokovic obtained an exemption on the basis he had recently contracted Covid-19, which the judge noted had satisfied a qualified physician and an independent panel set up by the Victorian government. But a delegate of the home affairs minister cancelled his visa on the basis the tennis star might pose a risk to public health. The government argues recently having Covid by itself does not justify an exemption, because Djokovic has recovered. In a hearing on Monday the federal circuit court heard procedural complaints about that decision. After a lengthy afternoon adjournment the government agreed to roll over but warned the nuclear option is still on the table. To exercise the personal power, Hawke will have to be satisfied: there is a ground to cancel the visa, in this case the alleged threat to public health; that Djokovic hasn’t dissuaded him of this; and that it is “in the public interest to cancel the visa”. Immigration law professor Mary Crock told Guardian Australia the Migration Act gives the minister “god-like powers” to cancel visas and if “they really decide to … the power is there”. Crock said only one ground needs to be made out to cancel a visa, natural justice rules do not apply to the decision, and the idea of “public interest” is a broad one that could fit the current scenario. “Everything that has gone before can be disregarded – it is set up precisely for this situation, to come in and cancel a visa anyway. “The politics behind this is enormous … If the visa is cancelled under this provision – you’re excluded for three years,” she said. “Australia would be at risk of losing the Australian Open.” Crock said such a cancellation is “not common” and would “definitely end up in court again” – this time to answer the substantive question of whether an unvaccinated person poses a risk. Amid a surging wave of Omicron cases, the idea one unvaccinated person could pose a threat seems ludicrous – but the Migration Act is built to allow the government to deport first and ponder proportionality later. The architecture Australian governments designed to deter unlawful arrivals and reverse lawful ones at the drop of a hat may now be directed at the man vying to become recognised as the greatest ever male tennis player. The Morrison government has already tried once to crack this walnut with the proverbial sledgehammer, the only question now is whether they’re desperate enough to prove “rules are rules” by having another swing.",Sport/Sport,"Djokovic wins in court, but Australia’s government can still use its nuclear option to deport him",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/10/djokovic-wins-in-court-but-australias-government-can-still-use-its-nuclear-option-to-deport-him
1/10/2022,"Until 2019, virtual reality was an absolute faff to use. It was expensive and tethered by cables to expensive PCs, but the wireless and easy-to-use Oculus Quest has changed that. Once the headset is on you can browse from a few hundred apps and games designed for VR, many of which are social spaces designed for chatting to other people. VRChat is one of several, and the most popular, partly because it is intriguingly wild and random. Some VR spaces – including Meta’s Horizon – attempt a kind of calming, sanitised, futuristic look, with soft colours and cartoonish humanoids. VRChat is a total mishmash, dominated by anime aesthetics: neon cities, cat ears, big-busted, scantily clad 2D women, and of course furries (that’s sexualised anthropomorphic cartoon animals, for anyone fortunate enough not to know).  Portals lead to different chatrooms – a club, a beach, apartments, galleries – all of which look like they’re straight out of a video game from 2009. This is not an aesthetically rich experience. In a miniature cyberpunk city, my eyes are assaulted by clashing neon and giant billboards advertising different spaces and communities, mostly adorned with smiling anime girls. In my latest trip into VRChat, a little green robot, a giant banana and a frog – other players – are wandering about aimlessly. The frog looks at me and gives a thumbs up. I exchange a few hellos with a Korean raccoon, before he walks off. The point, in as much as there is one, is to find other people to chat with. And because a very large proportion of VRChat’s users are teenagers, people seem to be mostly interested in messing with each other. Trolling might be seen as a problem in virtual spaces by adults, but for teens it is rather the point, as evidenced by hundreds of YouTube video compilations. “Edgy” humour is the norm here. The first thing anyone said to me in VRChat (a few years ago now) was: “Hey, do you want to do drugs?”, in a voice that had definitely not yet hit puberty. It reminds me a little of Second Life, the online virtual world that briefly captured headlines in the early 00s, where I was once approached by a giant squirrel who offered to sell me a “bucket of Aids”. I did not encounter problems everywhere I went on VRChat – mostly just banalities and nonsense – but if I wanted to go looking, I would not have to go far to find someone spouting slurs for laughs, or one of the explicitly adult rooms. Getting a conversation going at all can be a challenge. The truth is that most chats are random, fleeting and rather pointless, or mildly unpleasant. Right now, apps such as VRchat work on a kind of self-regulating report system when it comes to moderation: players who continually receive complaints about their behaviour gradually lose privileges, and you can mute or block other users if they’re annoying or harassing you. Given how endemic toxicity is online, from Twitter to Facebook to Call of Duty, I do not have high confidence that Meta or indeed anyone in the big tech world has either the will or the means to make the online world universally pleasant and safe. In this way, VR worlds are no better or worse than anywhere else online. Bearing in mind that like social media, VR headsets are not intended for users under 13, the best we can do at the moment is equip teens to deal with it.",News/Technology,VR worlds are no better or worse than anywhere else online,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/10/vr-worlds-are-no-better-or-worse-than-anywhere-else-online
1/10/2022,"To Paradise, Hanya Yanagihara’s vast, complex follow-up to her Booker-shortlisted A Little Life, is a novel of many faces. I could tell you, for instance, that it’s about colonialism and racism in America today; or that it’s a queer counterfactual history (and future) that asks what would happen if sexuality were destigmatised (and then restigmatised); or an elegy for the lost kingdom of Hawaii. Most readers, I think, will concentrate on the book’s longest section, the third, in which Yanagihara writes of a series of pandemics and the way they reshape society in the decades ahead. To Paradise is arranged in three discrete but interrelated parts. The first, Washington Square, is set in the 1890s in a fictional New York. History has gone through a delicious skew, so that the north-eastern states have seceded from the rest of the US, part of a more general post-civil war rearrangement. Our hero for this section is David Bingham, the dreamy and foppish scion of a banking empire. He lives with his grandfather, Nathaniel, in a beautiful house in Washington Square. The “Free States” based their independence on the question of gay marriage – it seems that, with all stigma stripped away from homosexuality, around half of the citizens choose same-sex relationships.  This section is in essence a love story, as David, “still almost-young”, falls for the 23-year-old Edward, a music teacher. There is another potential suitor for David: the bluff, genial Charles Griffiths, a New Englander. As David attempts to choose between the two men, Nathaniel Bingham looks into Edward’s past and finds that all may not be as it seems. David is faced with a choice: the certainty of life in the Free States or a journey westwards, to California, to paradise. The second part of the book, Lipo-Wao-Nahele is itself divided in two sections. The first is about another David Bingham, this one a junior paralegal carrying out a semi-illicit affair with his boss, the wealthy Charles Griffiths. It is the 1980s, deep in the heart of a pandemic (which we presume is Aids – it is never named). Even from Griffiths’s opulent Washington Square home (the house is one of the constants in the novel), there is the sense of a city under siege. Yanagihara has always been brilliant on the trappings of the good life, but here there’s an almost fetishistic caressing of material goods, a celebration of luxury as necessity at a time of crisis. We discover in this second section that David Bingham is “from one of the oldest families in Hawai’i… If things had gone differently, I would have been king.” David is Kawika, heir to a throne that no longer exists. The dark history of the US annexation of Hawaii is too complex to unpack here, but it is one of the key themes running through the novel; how American capitalism warped and curdled Hawaii’s sense of itself. The drifting, gentle David/Kawika, and the narrator of the second half of this section, Wika, David’s damaged and dying father, are collateral damage in this half-forgotten act of colonialism. The final part of the novel is Zone Eight. Again, the section is split in two, although these two parts interweave and reflect upon each other. One thread is set in the 2090s, two centuries after the novel opens, and is narrated by Charlie, who we learn is a survivor of one of the terrible zoonotic pandemics that swept the globe in the course of the 21st century. She is a strangely blank, affectless character: she fell ill as a child in the pandemic of 2070 and the experimental drug that was used to cure her has half-destroyed her mind. Charlie lives, again, on Washington Square, although the house has been divided into apartments. The world is ruled from Beijing and all the marks of classic dystopia are there: the internet has been shut down, the press is state-controlled, books are banned, the secret police spy on people using insect drones. This narrative is intercut with letters from another Charles Griffiths, Charlie’s father, who is writing to Peter, a fellow scientist in “New Britain”. His letters begin in 2043 and take us through the dark years of the second half of the 21st century, where each new wave of disease becomes an excuse for increasingly totalitarian modes of control. It’s brilliant and horrifying in equal measure, particularly if, like me, you’re temperamentally disinclined to worry too much about the loss of freedoms in the face of a pandemic. I’m not about to burn masks in Parliament Square, but this is a novel that really forces you to examine your woolly liberal assumptions about the motives behind lockdowns. Put together, the three sections of the novel combine to deliver a series of powerful statements about progress and utopia, about those who are excluded from our visions of a better world. Yanagihara asks us in particular to move beyond binary configurations of sexuality, race and health, to challenge any political movement that seeks to privilege one group or another based on narrow definitions of identity. We are all multiple selves in the world of To Paradise. Nabokov said that names carry “coloured shadows” in a novel and the repetition of names across the three sections is on one level quite simple: this is a multigenerational family saga, showing how fortunes rise and fall over centuries, questioning the idea of inheritance and examining ideas of family that extend beyond blood ties. There’s something more than this, though, something that chips away at the verisimilitude of the novel, that asks us to engage in a complicated way with the very idea of characters in a book: these are figures facing similar challenges in different times, but the points of correspondence reveal essential truths about what it means to be human at a time of crisis. Sometimes literature takes time to digest momentous events: the great novels of the Napoleonic wars, of the Holocaust, of the plague, weren’t published until decades after the episodes they describe. Occasionally, though, a masterpiece emerges from the white heat of the moment: The Great Gatsby, The Decameron, The Waste Land. There’s something miraculous about reading To Paradise while the coronavirus crisis is still playing out around us, the dizzying sense that you’re immersed in a novel that will come to represent the age, its obsessions and anxieties. It’s rare that you get the opportunity to review a masterpiece, but To Paradise, definitively, is one. To Paradise by Hanya Yanagihara is published by Pan Macmillan (£20, AU$32.99).

1/10/2022,"Fears are growing among experts, politicians, and former generals about the rise of rightwing extremism in the US military and the potential threat it could pose to American democracy. Even as the US Department of Defense issues new policies to root out extremism in its ranks, some experts caution that the safeguards don’t go far enough, leaving the next election vulnerable to attack as well as fears about a broader violent “insurgency” by rightwing radicals.  “We’re behind the ball on what we know about domestic terrorists in the United States,” Paul Eaton, a retired US army major general and senior adviser to the non-profit VoteVets, said. Eaton and two other retired army generals recently wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post last month warning of the threat of a coup in the 2024 election. The generals warned that it could succeed with the aid of rogue military elements. They contemplated the possibility of a breakdown of the chain of command, along partisan lines, in the aftermath of a contested election with “rogue units organizing among themselves to support the ‘rightful’ commander in chief”. Eaton said in an interview that the American military and law enforcement have a history of underestimating the threat from the far right. “It’s the Timothy McVeigh problem: what did we know about McVeigh and what were we doing about it?” said Eaton. The 1995 Oklahoma City bombing killed 168 people and injured over 650 when one morning ex-army soldiers Timothy McVeigh and co-conspirator Terry Nichols parked a rental truck filled with homemade explosives outside a federal building and detonated it. It remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in US history. The two men harbored anti-government and racists beliefs. “The McVeighs of the world are still there, we had about 4,500 of them crawling all over the nation’s capitol [during the 6 January attack],” said Eaton, who added that the increased power of the internet and rise of social media had boosted the threat massively since McVeigh’s attack. “The infection of extremism into our state and local police and our armed forces is a very serious concern that needs to be monitored,” said Eaton. Eaton added: “There’s a recruiting effort going on locally, they’re going to school boards, like missionaries sent to the islands to convert people. The Proud Boys and Oath Keepers are definitely recruiting.”” In many ways the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol in Washington DC laid bare the vulnerability of US service members to extremism. The 727 defendants charged in the 6 January Capitol riot include 81 with ties to the military, while five were active duty service members. A 35-year-old woman, air force veteran Ashli Babbitt, was fatally shot while attempting to break the doors into the House chamber. The appeal of extremism among active duty and veterans is a longstanding issue with a track record of violent incidents. Last year army private Ethan Phelan Melzer confessed to prosecutors in the southern district of New York to plotting an attack on fellow soldiers in his unit. The federal indictment states that Melzer confessed to sharing sensitive information about his soon-to-deploy unit with members of a neo-Nazi group in order to facilitate an attack that would “result in the deaths of as many of his fellow service members as possible”. In 2018 marine lance corporal Vasillios Pistolis was imprisoned after assaulting people at the 2017 Charlottesville “Unite The Right” rally. Pistolis was discovered to belong the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen after bragging about violence in chats with other Atomwaffen members, which were eventually leaked. From 1990 to July 2021 there have been at least 354 people with military backgrounds that have committed criminal acts motivated by “political, economic, social, or religious goals” according to data collected by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. The data suggest the problem is growing in the US as from 1990-2010 there was an average of six cases a year, but over the last decade “that number has more than tripled to nearly 21 subjects per year”. The generals’ public call for elections safeguards in the military comes as the Pentagon issued new guidelines aimed at rooting out extremism in its ranks. The defense chief, Lloyd Austin, ordered a 60-day “stand down” early last year to come up with rules to stomp out extremism among the military’s various branches. The new rules adopted by the Pentagon last month specify that service members are prohibited from engaging in extremist activities and could face disciplinary action for even “liking” extremist content on social media. The new guidance specifies that commanders must not be “indifferent” and hold service members who participate in extremist activity accountable. The Pentagon defines extremism as advocacy for violence to achieve goals that are “political, religious, discriminatory, or ideological in nature”. It includes efforts to overthrow the government and advocating widespread unlawful discrimination “based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including pregnancy), gender identity, or sexual orientation”. Bu the Pentagon’s effort towards stomping out extremism in the military may not go far enough. An Associated Press investigation found the new guidelines fail to account for racism among the ranks, membership in groups such as the KKK, and longstanding racial disparities in military justice. The new guidelines don’t prohibit membership in extremist groups like the KKK as long as they are not “actively participating”. The new rules attempt to police acts rather than associations or beliefs. Some former military figures say it’s absurd to allow service members to also be members of violent extremist groups. “Seriously? You want to be in a foxhole with a guy whose a member of the KKK? Is that really what we want to do here?” said Eaton. “The idea of service members having to be in close proximity to card carrying members of the Proud Boys, as long as they don’t ‘march’, that just doesn’t get it.” he added. Some experts also criticize the approach as ignoring the very real threat of white supremacists. “It reflects the institutional bias that permeates all of our government, that even calling out white supremacy is politically fraught,” said Mike German, a former FBI special agent and current Fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. German is concerned the classification has the potential for unintended consequences. “It opens the door to a strange political ‘both sides-ism’,” he said. “The consequence is that somebody expressing anti-racism can be seen as an extremist under that description.” Experts see the far-right and other extremists as actively trying to recruit members of the military, including foreign agents seeking to promote disruption within the US. “We’re in the early stages of an insurgency in the Untied States,” said Kristofer Goldsmith, an Iraq war veteran and researcher. In a 200-page report published by Vietnam Veterans of America, Goldsmith found that between 2017 and 2019 foreign entities, such as Russian hackers, “coordinated online targeting of American service members, veterans, and their families” in an effort to disrupt American democracy. “We found 10 different ways foreign entities were targeting veterans online,” said Goldsmith, including through ads, fake veteran accounts that sent friend request to other veterans in order to penetrate the “relatively small community of veteran advocates, and found large social media pages run by foreign admins that spread disinflation tailored to veterans in a effort to influence the election”. Goldsmith sees anti-democratic, white supremacist and fascists movements targeting veterans for the same reason as foreign adversaries. “Veterans are an economically efficient target for campaigns, because if you get one, they often bring their immediate social circle with them,” said Goldsmith. Goldsmith warns that the coming election is vulnerable to a rising insurgency. “We saw a violent insurrection, we did not experience a peaceful transfer of power. It was an attempted coup. Every failed coup is just practice for the next one,” said Goldsmith.",News/US news,Rise of rightwing extremism in US military sparks fears over democracy,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/10/us-military-rightwing-extremism-american-democracy
1/10/2022,"Michael Gove, the communities and levelling up secretary, made a slightly delayed appearance on Radio 4’s Today programme after being trapped in a BBC lift for about half an hour. “We were hoping to talk to Michael Gove. You might have been hoping to hear from Michael Gove,” the presenter Nick Robinson told BBC listeners about five minutes after Gove’s interview had been due to begin at 8.10am.  “He’s very kindly come in to the building so we didn’t have to deal with one of those awkward line failures. Mr Gove is stuck in the Broadcasting House lift. I wish I could say this is a joke. It’s not a joke and it’s not very funny for Mr Gove and the security men, who have been stuck there for some time. “But he’s keeping cheerful, and even offered at one stage to talk to us on the phone. But I think we will try and get Mr Gove released from the Broadcasting House lift, and we hope to hear from him a little bit later in the programme.” Gove appeared about 10 minutes later, telling Robinson: “After more than half an hour in the lift you successfully levelled me up.” Saying “these sorts of things happen,” Gove insisted the mishap would not affect negotiations on the future of the BBC, saying it could instead be source material for the corporation’s BBC-set comedy W1A. Told by Robinson that the hashtag #FreeMichaelGove had been started on Twitter, the cabinet minister said he suspected there were “rather more people” who felt he should be incarcerated for longer. Gove said later he had texted the BBC chair, Richard Sharp, in order to be freed from the lift. Speaking on LBC, he said: “I’m talking to you from BBC New Broadcasting House but in a scene, perhaps, I think more appropriate for The Thick Of It or W1A, I was trapped in a BBC lift for half an hour between 7.45 and 8.15. “But, thanks to the good offices of the Today programme, and also thanks to my texting the BBC chairman, I was liberated. “He made sure that a crack engineering team were dispatched. As someone pointed out, even though we had to wait half an hour, eventually I was levelled up.” He said it was “very good advice from both a health and a safety point of view” to take the stairs out of the building. Gove was on a broadcast round principally to talk about a £4bn package intended to make sure leaseholders escape onerous costs in replacing combustible cladding. He is set to announce to parliament that residents of blocks between 11 meters and 18 metres tall will no longer face crippling bills. He has said developers and others responsible will be asked to pay, and that those who fail to do so could be penalised via legal means and, if needed, the tax system. Leaseholders in buildings with other fire-safety problems such as wooden balconies could still face significant bills, and campaigners have urged Gove to help them. In an earlier interview with BBC1’s Breakfast, Gove said the aim was to identify these other defects, saying the “guiding principe is that leaseholders should not be responsible” for such costs.",News/Politics,‘You levelled me up’: Michael Gove trapped in BBC lift,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/10/you-levelled-me-up-michael-gove-trapped-in-bbc-lift
1/10/2022,"Like Andy Dufresne in The Shawshank Redemption, the Rumour Mill continues in the early stages of its crawl to freedom, through 31 days worth of transfer-related foulness most people can’t even begin to imagine. And as unlikely a prospect as it seems, we’re also hoping to come out clean on the other side. Cristiano Ronaldo could be planning an audacious escape bid of his own as he weighs up an attempt to break out of Old Trafford, where everything has gone pear-shaped for Manchester United since they hijacked Manchester City’s attempt to sign the forward last summer. The Portugal international is reported to be in “crisis talks” with his agent Jorge Mendes over what to do next.  Tanguy Ndombele is hoping to find a new home where he will be more appreciated after being booed off the pitch and down the tunnel during his slow trudge upon being substituted during Spurs’ FA Cup win over Morecambe on Sunday. The Athletic reports that the French midfielder is anxious to leave the club in the current transfer window, having unsuccessfully agitated for a summer move. With more than two years left on his contract, whether or not Ndombele will be able to find a club willing to match his current £200,000-per-week wages remains to be seen and a loan move seems more likely in this window. Dutch winger Steven Bergwijn is also reportedly headed for the Tottenham door marked “Do One!” and could pitch up at Ajax in the coming weeks. Having brought in Philippe Coutinho on loan last week, Aston Villa are reported to be confident of signing out-of-favour Everton left-back Lucas Digne. Newcastle are also interested in signing the £25m-rated Frenchman, while Chelsea would like to bring him in to deputise for the sidelined Ben Chilwell, but only on loan. The European champions are also trying to recall Emerson Palmieri from his loan spell at Lyon but are meeting stout resistance. They will almost certainly have to compensate the French side in order to bring the Italian defender back to Stamford Bridge. With Kieran Trippier already one defeat into his Newcastle career, his new employers are interested in signing New Zealand striker Chris Wood from Burnley, all the better to convert the many delightful crosses they hope to see their new full-back ping towards opposition penalty areas. While you could be forgiven for thinking Wood’s employers would be unwilling to sell him to fellow relegation strugglers, reports suggest they are open to rinsing Newcastle’s preposterously wealthy new owners for an ageing player with just 18 months left on his contract. The Mags have also identified RB Salzburg’s young Swiss international centre-forward Noah Okafor as a potential target, it says here. Best known for a Puskas Award-nominated scorpion kick he scored for Newcastle Jets in the A-League three years ago, Riley McGree now plies his trade with MLS side Charlotte FC but spent the first half of this season on loan at Birmingham City. The midfielder is believed to be on the verge of joining his fellow Aussie, Ange Postecoglou, at Celtic despite firm interest from Championship sides Middlesbrough and Nottingham Forest. And finally, Gareth Bale is reported to be considering retirement when his contract with Real Madrid runs out this summer, but only if Wales fail to qualify for the World Cup. In the event of Wales booking a place at the winter jamboree through the play-offs, he is expected to prolong his playing career until the tournament by signing a short-term deal with some team or other from one of the English league’s top two tiers, in order to stay match fit ahead of Qatar.",Sport/Football,Football transfer rumours: Cristiano Ronaldo to leave Manchester United?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/10/football-transfer-rumours-cristiano-ronaldo-manchester-united-chris-wood-newcastle
