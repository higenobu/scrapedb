3/12/2022,"Last month, a group of California elementary school students launched a free hotline featuring on-demand inspiration and advice for anxious souls. With joy in short supply these days, the tiny school’s project has since gone viral, receiving thousands of calls hourly. Dial 707-998-8410 and you’ll hear a cheerful voice listing your options: “If you’re feeling mad, frustrated or nervous, press one. If you need words of encouragement and life advice, press two. If you need a pep talk from kindergarteners, press three. If you need to hear kids laughing with delight, press four.” After reading the morning’s headlines, I tend to need all of the above, so I was eager to give it a try. It took several attempts to get past the busy signal, but it was well worth it. I was immediately transported back to the optimistic days of my youth and reminded that often life is less complicated than we make it. It was clear these students have quiet wisdom well beyond their years, as well as a true appreciation for ice cream. I won’t spoil things by revealing all their tips, but here are a few I took to heart: “If you’re nervous, go get your wallet and spend it on ice cream and shoes.” “If you’re frustrated, you can always go to your bedroom, punch a pillow or cry on it and just go scream outside.” “If you’re mad or frustrated, you can do what you want to do best or you can do flips on the trampoline.” “If you’re sad or angry, go get a cookie, a smoothie or an ice cream.” Other pieces of advice could save you a great deal of money on therapy: “You are OK.” “Don’t give up – power through.” “The world is a better place with you in it.” “Choose weird.” And finally, a cognitive-behavioral approach: “If you’re feeling up high and unbalanced, think of groundhogs.” The project was envisioned by Jessica Martin and Asherah Weiss, who teach art at West Side Union elementary school in Healdsburg. “We wanted to do a project that was going to be simple enough to do and call on kids to think about what they wanted to say in the world, to uplift other people,” Weiss said. “And as we all know, we’ve been going through a lot these last few years. So we wanted to do something really simple but profound.” They went to each classroom in the small school, whose 141 students range in age from kindergarten to sixth grade. They gave the kids a simple prompt. “We said: ‘It’s been a very rough few years. You kids are incredibly resilient. And you found all kinds of ways to stay joyful,’” Martin said. They encouraged the children to think of moments when they felt frustrated and they’d received good advice, or come up with something helpful on their own. “So all of the responses are really coming from the kids and their own life experience, and the advice they’ve gleaned over their short years on this planet.” In crafting their advice, the students were keenly aware of the bleak backdrop: the war in Ukraine, local wildfires that have required yearly evacuations, and the seemingly endless pandemic. After more than a year of remote learning, the students were all too familiar with the isolation of Covid. “I experienced it – home schooling and quarantine,” said Natisse, a fifth-grader. Rosalie, another fifth-grader, said it wasn’t hard to come up with ideas. “It’s good to say nice things to people,” she said. “So I’d say a lot of things come into your head.” In Healdsburg, a northern California community of 12,000, the hotline was “a fun project that seemed like it was going to have kind of a small reach”, said Susie Dalton, the school’s fifth-grade teacher. “But it’s been amazing for everybody to see the impact it’s had on a larger scale.” Students initially distributed cards and flyers announcing the project, dubbed Peptoc – which was how Martin’s son, a first-grader at the school, spelled “pep talk”. As word of mouth spread, the project went viral on social media and in the news. Martin had signed up for the cheapest hotline provider she could find, thinking the kids would be excited to hear 100 people had called in a month, she said. “And then two days later, we’re getting 500 an hour, and now we’re getting 9,000 an hour.” The positive response has been overwhelming. “We get people saying, ‘Oh, we’re so relieved to have the resource’, or ‘this made me cry so I sent it to all my friends’,” said Rosalie. Martin said staff and patients at Johns Hopkins medical center had been regularly calling the hotline. Rima Meechan, the school’s principal and superintendent, heard from a woman with cancer who calls during her treatments. Weiss said she had seen the school’s office manager in tears on the phone with the administrator of an Iowa elder care facility, where most patients are over 90 years old. “She was calling to thank all of the kids, because she played it for everyone who was part of that facility, and she said: ‘I haven’t heard laughter like that from them in years.’” Martin said she was “pretty thrilled” for the kids: “They get to see that literally just one kind word can lift up millions.” The hotline, which will be updated with new messages in the coming months and is funded by donations, has also had an effect closer to home. James Greenwald, a kindergarten teacher who has taught at the school for 28 years, recently heard from an old friend who’d been facing some personal challenges. “Apparently he had called the hotline, and he texted me: ‘I just bought myself an ice cream.’”",News/US news,"‘If you’re sad, get a cookie’: how US schoolkids launched a hotline to spread joy",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/11/kids-pep-talk-hotline-peptoc

3/12/2022,"On a Monday night before Christmas in a chapel in Abersoch, a concert is taking place. Abersoch is a seaside village on the Llŷn peninsula, the arm that sticks out from north Wales into the Irish Sea; and this is the end of term Christmas concert of Ysgol Abersoch, the local primary school, a wooden building across the road from the chapel. On the pews, spaced out in an attempt to keep Omicron at bay, sit parents, villagers, governors, former pupils; some are all of the above, about 50 in total. At the front of the chapel, facing the audience on the other side of a wooden altar rail, are the performers: children aged between four and seven, and dressed colourfully, as an elf, a doll, an angel, a reindeer, a grandmother with orange hair … and that’s it. There are just five of them. Ysgol Abersoch is a very small school; that’s the problem, though not everyone sees it that way. Actually, there are seven children in the school. But it’s a miracle even five made it tonight. There’s a lot of Covid around; on Friday there were only two pupils in school. But Linda Jones – Mrs Jones, the headteacher, the only full-time teacher, also a former pupil – wasn’t going to let anything stop the concert. Even if none of the children had made it, she would have gone ahead, using puppets instead. Mrs Jones sits in the front row, prompting, nudging, sometimes playing the clarinet during a song. The children sing, and sway in time, and wave at their families. Vera, the eldest, narrates the story, which is called The Colours of Christmas. It’s all in Welsh. At the end, the audience joins in with Dawel Nos (Silent Night). And Father Christmas (who is actually – look away now, any children reading – Dewi Roberts, a local councillor) turns up with a bin bag full of goodies. It’s a lovely evening. Ysgol Abersoch pupils performing their Christmas concert last year. It’s also a really sad evening. The school, which opened in 1924, is being closed down. Not at the end of the school year, but now, at Christmas. Gwynedd council says it’s not practical or financially viable to keep such a small school open. It costs £17,404 per pupil, compared with the county average of £4,198. Closing it will save an estimated £96,000 a year. But the people of Abersoch, not least the people here in Graig chapel tonight, say it will be the death blow to a community slowly being suffocated by wealthy second-home owners. They point out that the village is empty for much of the year but unaffordable to local families. It’s a story that will resonate in pretty coastal villages across Devon and Cornwall – Kingston, South Huish, Dalwood, St Minver, Padstow and St Merryn, and many more. Also elsewhere in Wales: there were the news reports about the village of Cym-Yr-Eglwys in Pembrokeshire having only one permanent resident left, but these stories were contested, not least by the 10 or so year-round residents who say the situation is more complicated and deeper-rooted than simply millionaire English second-homers buying up all the properties. Ysgol Abersoch teacher Natalie Williams (left) and headteacher Linda Jones with twins Maisie and Charlotte, six, Vera, seven, Melissa, five, and Mansar, four. The school in 1924. In Abersoch, though, the issue is plain. In 2020, 46% of the housing stock was second homes, when commercial holiday lets are included in the definition; there is a luxury development going up where flats will sell for £1.5m; and it is home to Wales’s most expensive street, where the houses are worth much more, while local families live in caravans in the surrounding countryside. And now the school going – the final blow. At the end of the concert, Eifiona Wood – governor, former parent, former pupil of Ysgol Abersoch – stands up and speaks, in Welsh and English. “We can only thank you, from the bottom of our hearts, for making us what we are today,” she says to everyone who has been involved in the school past and present. She chokes up a bit, and she’s not the only one. That’s not quite the end; there are still a few school days left. Next morning, four children make it to class: Vera, who’s seven; twins Maisie and Charlotte, six; and Melissa, five. At the school gate, the twins’ mother, Annette Weston, says she’s devastated. “Some people say there are only a few children here – they can’t be getting a good experience. But it’s totally the opposite. It’s like dropping them off at a family house: it’s a fabulous way to learn, and they love it.” She says there are 23 children in the village who could be coming to Ysgol Abersoch, which goes up only to year 3, after which pupils go to the school at Sarn Bach, a mile and a half away. The reason more haven’t been coming is that it’s had the threat of closure hanging over it for years. “If you took away the closing order, it wouldn’t be an issue; the school would have plenty of children. I think they took the decision years ago and they’ve been waiting like vultures for numbers to drop to a point where they say, ‘That’s it, we’re going to close.’” Second homes in Gwynedd are charged 200% council tax. Vera’s mother, Eva Palanova, thinks that this, as well as the stamp duty generated by Abersoch’s thriving property market, could be used to finance the school. “I’m from the Czech Republic. We went through a similar process during communism – built these massive school hubs for 4,000 kids. But now they are reopening all these little schools because parents realise that that’s not what they want; they want a local connection.” Inside, it doesn’t feel like the end of anything, just the beginning of another day. The classroom is bright and friendly. The walls are covered in school work and art – pictures of a deer, a salmon, a raven, all done in leaves; a project about Diwali; a map of the peninsula. The morning begins with a song about the days of the week, in Welsh. Abersoch, like all the primary schools in this part of Wales, is Welsh language. Mrs Jones sits on the floor, facing the four girls, again prompting when required. The school’s only other teacher, Natalie Williams – Miss Williams – is also in today; you don’t get that kind of teacher-student ratio at many schools. Mrs Jones remembers being a little girl in this room; she never thought she’d end up as head. She’s desperately sad about her school being closed down, but doesn’t want to go into it too much; she’s going to have to find another job. She doesn’t know what or where yet, and may consider supply teaching. What about Miss Williams – what will she do? “Cry,” she says. Then she’ll probably go back to supply teaching, too. There aren’t a lot of permanent teaching jobs in the area. Headteacher Linda Jones with pupils in the classroom. How do the kids feel about the school closing? “Sad!” they say, in unison. What do they like about Ysgol Abersoch? “Everything!” Incidentally, there is one boy who attends the school, named Bobby, but he’s off, too. Another student has come in: Mansar, who is four. She hasn’t been well, but she wanted to be in the photo. The Guardian’s photographer is going to recreate the first photograph of the school taken in the 1920s – pupils and staff, outside, standing against a corner of the building. It will serve as pictorial punctuation to end a chapter just shy of a hundred years long. Mansar’s dad, Sarwar Jamil, the only Iraqi Kurd on the peninsula, is also sad. “The school has been lovely and welcoming. Education is the main thing in the world. If I had any power, I wouldn’t let it happen.” He left Iraq about 17 years ago, ending up cleaning cars on Anglesey. His Welsh is now so-so, he says; Mansar’s is much better. Afew minutes’ walk away, in Eifiona Wood’s kitchen, I meet three of the school’s governors. With Eifiona are Margot Jones and Louise Overfield. Louise didn’t go to Ysgol Abersoch – she’s an outsider, from England. But her partner, Dylan, did, and their children. Margot, chair of the governors, went there, as did her children; her son Tom recently graduated from Cambridge University, and yes, she does hold Ysgol Abersoch responsible. “I think the attention he received in his formative years, the confidence he was given through being in a small school where everyone’s voice is heard, plays where everyone has a part, everyone is seen, everyone is valid – I can’t image a better start in life.” Margot has joined by Zoom, even though she’s just round the corner – she’s recovering from Covid. She and the others are actually ex-governors: they resigned when they learned that the council expected them to dismiss the school’s staff, Mrs Jones and Miss Williams. “We will not do their dirty work for them,” they said. They are devastated – and furious. Angry that the closure went ahead during a pandemic, and that it’s happening in the middle of the school year. Angry that none of the initiatives they’ve started – a nursery, parent and toddler group, beach school, a petition with 3,000 signatures (including that of Bear Grylls, who owns a nearby island) – has succeeded in saving the school. “It just feels like we were walk-on parts in a panto: we had custard pie thrown at us throughout but it’s not really very funny,” says Margot, who has a lovely way with words, even coming out of a laptop. And they are anxious about what it will mean for their village and their community. “We’ve already lost our bank, our post office, our surgery,” Eifiona says. “There are a lot of second homes, but there is a really strong local community, a strong-willed community, as well.” Margot worries about the survival of that community, that by taking away the school you lose the mortar that holds it together. “Our parents have been there, we’ve been there, our children have been there, we want our children’s children to go there, and all this has just been lost – that continuity is going to be smashed. It will leave a gaping hole. This community is really in danger of becoming nothing more than a holiday camp.” She knows that tourism brings jobs and income. “I’ll put my hand up now and say I actually have a holiday let which could have been a home for someone. It’s a struggle to balance that. I justify it by saying that I live here. Any money I earn from it is spent locally … but is that a bit thin? I don’t know.” Eifiona points out the irony that a large majority of the councillors are Plaid Cymru, the party aiming for a million Welsh speakers by 2050. Closing a place of learning in Welsh in the centre of one of the most anglicised villages in Wales will have a negative impact on the language there, the ex-governors say. Cymdeithas yr Iaith, the Welsh language pressure group, is similarly unimpressed. “Gwynedd has the highest percentage of holiday homes in Wales, and as a result, house prices are out of proportion with local wages,” Jeff Smith, chair of Cymdeithas’s sustainable communities group, says over email. Abersoch, he argues, now faces an additional challenge. By closing the school, the council is “undermining their housing and language policies and abandoning the community”. Abersoch is lovely. It was once a fishing hamlet; the little harbour where the River Soch reaches the sea opens out on to a golden sandy beach, with an even better one just round the headland. On a clear day, the views stretch from the verdant farmland of the interior of the Llŷn peninsula to the mountains of Snowdonia and across Cardigan Bay all the way to Pembrokeshire. No surprise it’s become such a popular tourist destination. A building plot overlooking the main beach in Abersoch. Beach huts. In the media it’s been branded Cheshire-by-the-Sea, because of the number of wealthy visitors who come here from there, as well as everywhere else: footballers, football managers, television personalities, soap stars, adventurers, a lord chief justice, captains of industry, and plenty of ordinary folks on holiday. Walking through the village, there might not be a doctors’ surgery, a bank or a post office (there are post office facilities in the Londis), but there are plenty of boutiques, surf shops, ice-cream parlours, cafes and restaurants, including a Mexican one. On a winter day like this, many are empty, and some are closed; there are few people around at all, famous or otherwise. It’s a very different story in the summer. There are two estate agents. One of them doesn’t want to talk to the Guardian; perhaps they’re a tiny bit embarrassed about having just sold a beach hut for £191,000 (£16,000 over the asking price) when local people can only dream of getting a toe on the property ladder. The other, Rhys Elvins, is happy to chat. He’s just sold a 1960s bungalow overlooking the golf course. It was on for £975,000 and went in two weeks, for £1.01m. He’s got a three-bedroom chalet in The Warren holiday park for just £250k, which sounds like a bargain for around here until you hear it’s only a 19-year lease. I’d call that more of an expensive let, and it’s a way back from the beach. Even so, everything is going super quick. Perhaps because people haven’t been able to go abroad in the pandemic, their outlooks have changed, or they’re retiring earlier. The record is £2.95m, for a three-bedroom house, though that one was on the seafront. Our guide for the unofficial Abersoch real estate tour is Einir Williams. She is Abersoch born and bred – the family farm is on the edge of the village. Einir, a former pupil of Ysgol Abersoch, is the school clerk; she is also secretary to the parish council. She gets to see the planning applications for extensions, demolitions and new buildings. An empty plot on the way out of the village is where the Whitehouse hotel used to be and where work is due to start this year on a new £30m development. It will be called The Abersoch, a luxury hotel with 42 rooms and suites, a destination restaurant, pool, gym and spa, as well as 18 apartments. Dewi Roberts (Santa Claus from last night, a big supporter of the school and opponent of its closure) says it will provide 40 much-needed jobs for the area, though the people who get these jobs may not be snapping up the flats. They’re already being marketed from £675,000 for a two-bedroom flat that won’t have a view of the sea, up to £1.65m for a three-bedroom one that will. Einir takes us round the Benar headland, recently identified as Wales’s most expensive street (even though it isn’t really a street), where houses cost, on average, £2,152,000. There’s a definite look to most of the Benar properties: a lot of glass, a lot of grey, a lot of decking – think Sandbanks meets Big Little Lies. They’re probably lovely inside. Einir is not a fan. “It’s become a play area for people who come in their flash cars,” she says. Not today, though. Again, there’s not a soul to be seen. The beach hut that sold for £191,000. Past the yacht club and down on to Abersoch beach, where the beach huts are, with a sold sign on the blue and white one that’s just gone for £191,000. It’s not even the biggest. It doesn’t have water or electricity; it is essentially a very expensive shed. Einir takes us to another house, in the centre of the village, with a banner hanging from the window: “Nid yw Cymru ar Werth” (“Wales is not for sale”, which, given what we’ve just been seeing, seems like wishful thinking). This is the house of Anna Jones – again, Abersoch to the core, both a past pupil and past headteacher of the school. She recently had eggs thrown at her home, though she’s not sure if it was because of the banner or because it was Halloween. Also present is Wyn Williams, another former pupil, and the previous chair of the governors, as well as a former local councillor. If the empty grey and glass houses of the headland are what Abersoch will become, sitting around the table in this cosy kitchen, with Anna, Wyn, Einir, and a plate of buttered bara brith, feels like what Abersoch is in danger of losing. They share memories of the school. Wyn, who was there during the war, remembers the coal-burning stove in the middle of the classroom, and the headteacher, Miss Thomas, who was very strict and had a black book into which went the names of children who misbehaved. “I was in the black book quite often,” he says, not unproudly. Anna, who went as a pupil in 1948, digs out old school photos, including one of her with a severely and unfortunately angled fringe; she’d cut it herself, she remembers. When Anna went back as headteacher, in 1996, there were 11 children. At the end of her reign, in 2003, it was up to 30. “It has always been like that – a coming and going school,” Einir says. And now it’s going completely. From left: former headteacher Anna Jones with former pupils Einir Williams and Wyn Williams. Wyn doesn’t blame the council, even though he says the process hasn’t been ideal. “Our dear friend Mr [George] Osborne cut local authority budgets by 40%. If you go to any local authority in Wales or England, you’ll find they’re suffering.” And staying with Tory policy but going back further, he lays plenty of blame on the Thatcher government, in particular Kenneth Baker’s 1988 Education Reform Act, which meant parents no longer simply sent their kids to the local school but were allowed to choose, with schools competing for customers like businesses. They all agree that the closing of the school is linked to second homes, house prices, young families not being able to afford to live here; again Wyn points another finger at Thatcher. “The other thing Mrs Thatcher did was she allowed council houses to be sold, didn’t she?” Last year a former council house sold for £385,000. Abersoch has always been wealthier than the surrounding area, and that’s all because of the tourists. They first came in the early 1900s, but it was after the war that it really took off as a holiday destination. Anna remembers her mother renting out rooms in the family farmhouse, and cooking for the guests. “That’s the only time I can remember having toast for breakfast. My mother used to cut the crusts off for them and we were allowed to eat the crusts. I enjoyed having them. I learned to speak English – I used to go for rides with some of them.” She changed her mind when her parents started to rent out the whole house over the summer, and Anna and her family moved into a room above the barn. She remembers the mayor of Liverpool coming to stay. “I was very active with the Welsh Language Society. He used to say, ‘I’m only coming for a holiday,’ and I said, ‘Don’t speak to me!’” Is she still militant, I wonder? “Oh, it’s in here,” she says, holding a hand to her heart. It’s not like the 1980s though, when Meibion Glyndŵr, the Welsh nationalist group, were burning down holiday homes, is it? “It’s surprising how many people I have heard saying it’s about time Meibion Glyndŵr came back,” she says. She tried unsuccessfully to put a clause in her will saying that her house could only be sold to local people. And if it ends up as holiday rental, on Airbnb? “Then I will come back and haunt them.” Wyn says it’s not about hatred: “Everyone relies on the tourist industry.” And it’s not only the locals who do well out of it. “In the past year, the Senedd in Cardiff has had £6m from Abersoch in stamp duty,” he says. Top: houses out of season are dark and quiet. Above: an architect-designed house overlooking Abersoch beach and harbour. There were more than 900 people on the electoral register in Abersoch when Wyn became a councillor in 1995. Now it’s down to 568. Of the 30 houses in the street he lives on, only about three are occupied in winter. “It’s dark at night,” Einir says. “There’s no one living here – it’s all second homes.” It’s the same story in other parts of Wales, Pembrokeshire, Devon, Cornwall, Ireland, other places in Europe, Wyn says: “They call them the black villages in Finland.” But perhaps in Wales, where it’s about more than pricing locals out of their homes, and a national language and culture is at stake, it hits a particular nerve. Jeff Smith of Cymdeithas points to a rally in Newport in October, when a young woman training to be a teacher told the crowd that she could not afford a house in the village she grew up in or the surrounding area because prices had increased so much. “The Welsh government has begun discussing emergency measures to tackle the problem of second and holiday homes,” he says. “But there is more that the government can do now, such as closing loopholes in the law that allow people to avoid taxes on second homes by registering them as a business.” He calls for a property act that – through measures such as changing the definition of affordable housing and controlling rent prices – will “secure a home for everyone”. To Rhyd-y-clafdy, a small village a few miles inland but a world away from Abersoch. Actually, to outside Rhyd-y-clafdy, along a muddy farm track, to one more kitchen, though there’s no room for a table here. In the static caravan where Tom Evans and Charlotte Williams live with their five-month-old son Twm and a labrador, also five months, the kitchen doubles as living room, nursery and everything else. Tom, 26, is a plumber, doing his gas apprenticeship (it means at least the caravan has heating); Charlotte, 21, drives a taxi, taking kids who have special needs to school, though she’s on maternity leave at the moment. They’d like to live in Abersoch, but can’t afford it. They can’t afford to buy, or rent, anywhere around here. “I was brought up here, we’ve got a kid, we can’t live where we want to,” Tom says. “And all the holiday homes, people in them a few weekends of the year and six weeks in summer – the rest of the time they’re empty, and there are people like us struggling in a caravan.” Tom Evans and Charlotte Williams inside their caravan. They have been on a list for a council house for more than a year, but have heard nothing, even since the baby. That’s when life got really hard. “There’s not enough room for all the baby things,” Charlotte says. “I have to sell things as soon as he grows out of them because we haven’t got anywhere to keep them. If we have another, we’ll have to buy everything again.” Tom was working in Manchester before, and had thought of asking Charlotte to move there. “If it was just the two of us, I would’ve considered it,” she says. “But with the baby, I want family around me. I’d like to bring Twm up here.” Tom thinks the only solution is to build more affordable homes and council houses; otherwise, the situation is going to get worse. “It’s just going to turn people against each other in the end.” They have heard about the £191,000 beach hut. “Sickening,” Tom says. I don’t think they’ll be putting their names down for an apartment at The Abersoch, even one without a sea view. Back in Abersoch that evening, walking around with the photographer, it looks like Wyn Williams’s black village. There’s a light in one window, then nothing for a couple of houses, then a light in Anna’s house, then more houses in darkness. A housing estate called Cae Du is in near darkness. Is there a power cut? No, because one house’s security light comes on as we pass. Then it goes out again – there’s no one here. This was once a field on Einir’s farm. Her father sold it, not knowing it would end up as holiday rentals and second homes, empty for much of the year. There may have been a forewarning in the name: cae du, she says, means black field. The following morning, leaving Abersoch, I pass the little wooden school. It must be break time, because in the playground, with its bright pictures of an octopus, a seal and a crab, there are children. I can see, and hear, the twins, Maisie and Charlotte; and Melissa, Vera and a boy who must be Bobby. They are playing, happily, loudly, in Welsh. It’s lovely, and also very sad. Because by the time you read this, there won’t be children playing there, or learning there, in Abersoch, any more.",News/UK news,"Hello £200k beach huts, goodbye primary school - the Welsh village hollowed out by second homes",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/12/abersoch-second-homes-holiday-wales
3/12/2022,"Ihad a lightbulb moment while making pastry the other day. “Malfatti!” I shouted, remembering the Italian dumplings made with spinach and ricotta. Malfatti translates to “poorly made”, and isn’t just a recipe but a principle that can be applied to pasta and pastry alike, in that misshapen offcuts can be repurposed for both. Whether you are making your own or using ready-made pastry, you will likely have offcuts from trimming, and those leftovers are essentially a new pastry base ready to roll out and bake into deliciously simple homemade biscuits. And if you have enough pastry to make a whole other tart or pie, the best option is to freeze it, either in a ball ready to roll or pre-rolled and set into a tart case, ready to bake. Rather than throw your pastry trimmings in the compost, transform it into these delicious biscuits, topped with any combination of sweet or savoury ingredients you fancy. I suggest spices, nuts and other store-cupboard ingredients that need using up. Excess pastryOptional toppings – flaky salt, grated cheese, seeds, nuts, spices, unrefined sugar, chocolate chips If your offcuts are already rolled out, then there’s no need to re-roll them. Lay a patchwork of the pastry on a baking tray, without overlapping. If you have a ball of excess pastry, roll it into a 5-10mm-thick sheet and lay on a baking tray. Next, choose your toppings. Go sweet with a combination of ingredients such as unrefined sugar, crushed nuts and chocolate chips, or go savoury with sea salt, crushed spices, seeds and grated cheese, all added to taste. Heat the oven to 190C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Run a rolling pin over the toppings to embed them into the pastry, then bake for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. Once cool, break into large, biscuit-sized shards. If you’ve made savoury biscuits, I recommend serving them with cheese and dips.",Lifestyle/Food,How to turn excess pastry into moreish biscuits – recipe,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/12/turn-excess-pastry-into-moreish-biscuits-zero-waste-cooking-tom-hunt
3/12/2022,"It’s 10am on a Saturday. My wife and I are in the waiting room of a van hire company somewhere on London’s north-western fringes. It had been my job to hire the van, but I’d left it late and there seems to be some kind of shortage. The only place that had one available was so far away my wife had to drive me there. It’s taking the customer ahead of me a long time to collect his van, because of his unwillingness, or inability, to provide proof of address. “I might leave you to it,” my wife says. “But what if something goes wrong?” I say. “Like what?” she says, walking out of the office door. Her inability to imagine unwanted outcomes is sometimes difficult to live with. Finally, it’s my turn. I present my documentation, and the young man behind the counter clicks his mouse. “There is one issue,” he says. “Is it that you don’t have any vans?” I say. This is precisely the unwanted outcome I’d been imagining. “It’s just that you requested the longer size,” he says. “Did I?” I say. “Let me show you what I’ve got,” he says. He sprints across the lot and returns at the wheel of a giant white van. I go out to meet him. “I can try to get you the bigger one,” he says. “I don’t want the bigger one,” I say. “Oh, man,” he says. “You’ve made my day!” I only need the van to drive a bed, some furniture, four boxes and some bin liners full of clothes and towels to the other end of London: the oldest one is moving out. I got emotional the first time the oldest one left home, but I’m used to it now. The last time – four years ago – he got into a taxi with all his stuff on a snowy evening just as I was returning home. As soon as he was gone my wife announced that she was never going to cook again, which proved to be the more traumatic turning point. When his lease ran out two years later, the oldest one returned. Then the pandemic hit. Then the middle one returned from the US. Suddenly I was cooking for five, every night. Once I’ve managed to pilot it home, the van does not take long to load. By midday we are riding high and heading east, with my wife sitting in the middle relaying the directions from her phone. “I can’t believe you don’t need a special licence to drive this thing,” the oldest one says. “I know, right?” I say, sailing off a roundabout. “Just proof of address.” “Actually you’re better at driving this than you are an ordinary car,” my wife says. “Out here I’m just another white van man,” I say. “Part of the brotherhood.” “You want to turn right,” my wife says. “I’ve got a heart of gold, an aggressive driving style and some frankly eye-watering political views,” I say. “Right here,” my wife says. “You mean right here, right here?” I say. “Yes,” she says. “OK,” I say, indicating. “Here we go.” “Oh wait,” she says. “Not this one.” There is a long silence while I battle my way back into the inside lane. Luckily I can’t see any of the cars behind me. An hour later we arrive at the oldest one’s flat, in what can only be called a young person’s part of London. Other people are also unloading their children’s stuff; it’s like the first day of university all over again. Neither of his flatmates has moved in yet, so unloading is a slow process involving several staging posts. Our departure, when it comes, is a little unceremonious: we leave him sitting alone in the low afternoon sun. “OK, have fun,” my wife says. “See you for Sunday lunch,” I say. “Not this Sunday.” Back in the van, my wife and I brace ourselves for the long trip back alone. “Remember,” I say. “I’m just an honest tradesman, out here trying to make a living.” “I get it,” she says. “So I need you to say the correct directions, well in advance.” “Fine,” she says. “Straight on.” “What about this upcoming thing?” I say. “It says straight.” “Chicane?” I say. “Is that the word?” It’s too late. My van is pinned by encroaching kerbs, with a line of bollards threatening my high white sides. All the sensors are beeping. I close my eyes for a second, thinking back to a much earlier moment, when I made someone’s day.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Tim Dowling: The oldest one’s off again, and I get to play white van man",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/12/tim-dowling-the-oldest-one-has-left-home-again-at-least-i-get-to-play-white-van-man

3/12/2022,"Earlier this week, Russia’s defence ministry acknowledged that young conscripts had been sent into battle and some taken prisoner. The admission, notable in itself given Russia’s careful attempts to control the narrative about the war, came just a day after President Vladimir Putin assured his nation in a video address that conscripts “are not participating and will not participate” in the conflict. The backtracking prompted some to question whether the Russian leader lied in his statement or was simply provided inaccurate information. “This incident reveals some of the unrealistic expectations Putin had when starting this military operation,” said Tatyana Stanovaya, the founder of R.Politik. “It looks likely that Putin genuinely thought Russia would be able to take Ukraine by storm and instructed his military not to use conscripts. But this is just one of the many aspects that have turned out differently in reality.” Two weeks into the war, it has become evident that the Russian army has failed in its initial plan to quickly seize major cities – including the capital, Kyiv, and Kharkiv in north-eastern Ukraine. The attack on Odesa, a crucial port city in the south, has also stalled, and Russian land advances have been thwarted repeatedly. More than a week ago, Russia admitted that almost 500 of its soldiers had been killed, a figure that has not since been updated, while US officials estimate that between 5,000 and 6,000 Russian troops have died. “The current problems should be traced back to the inception of this war, which was conducted in high secrecy to avoid any leaks,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “The Kremlin’s disastrous move to invade was rooted in giant lapses of expertise about Ukraine,” said Gabuev, who added that officials close to Putin who helped plan the invasion sincerely believed that many Ukrainians would welcome Russian soldiers, and that the country’s leadership would offer little resistance. “Only a very small group of generals were informed about the war, and they didn’t ask difficult questions that could help prepare for any scenarios other than a speedy Russian victory. “The whole war planning was reduced to a clandestine operation developed by just a handful of people in uniform – and the president himself,” said Gabuev. Reports from captured Russian soldiers, as well as leaked audio conversations between the Russian military, have indicated that much of the army was not informed of the invasion until the last moment. Russia also appears to have underestimated how united the west would be in the face of the invasion. “The Kremlin might have not anticipated just how toxic Russia would become in the eyes of the west,” said Maria Shagina, an international sanctions specialist at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. Shagina said that while the Kremlin expected sanctions, it has probably been surprised by the speed and unity with which the west and major multinational corporations have cut ties with Russia. Given the military and political setbacks, hints have emerged over the last few days that Putin may retract some of his initial far-reaching diplomatic demands, including his commitment to pushing through regime change in Ukraine. On Monday, Putin’s trusted spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told Reuters that Russia was ready to halt military operations if Kyiv meets its list of conditions. Those terms would require Ukraine to cease military action, enshrine neutrality in its constitution, acknowledge Crimea as Russian territory and recognise the separatist republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. The demands omitted to mention the “denazification” of the Ukrainian leadership, previously flagged by Putin as the main motivation for the invasion. However, most analysts and western officials believe that an eventual Russian military victory remains the most realistic scenario given its overwhelming military power. Despite the setbacks it has experienced, Russian forces have been regrouping north-west of the Ukrainian capital, in what western intelligence has said could be preparation for an assault on Kyiv. Russian forces have also surrounded the strategically important cities Kharkiv and Mariupol, which have come under increasingly intense bombardment. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, failed to make a breakthrough during ceasefire talks in the Turkish city of Antalya on Thursday, suggesting that Russia is not rushing to find a solution to the war. And while some in the west have pinned their hopes on Russia’s business and political elites stopping the war, experts in Russia generally agree that the invasion has not yet affected Putin’s grip on power. “Elites have been silenced. While many are opposed to this war, none are expected to speak out,” said Stanovaya. There has been some quiet grumbling among some of the country’s richest citizens who have lost millions following western sanctions. Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch close to Putin, has raised alarm in a series of public posts about the war’s economic consequences for Russia. But Deripaska and others have been careful to not criticise Putin directly. Meanwhile, some senior officials also look to be taken aback by the invasion. According to a report by the well-connected Russian journalist Farida Rustamova, “the mood in the corridors of power is not at all happy. Many are in a state of near-paralysis.” On Thursday, the Kommersant business news outlet reported that the influential head of Russia’s central bank, Elvira Nabiullina, was considering resigning. A source close to Nabiullina confirmed to the Guardian that the central bank head had considered leaving her post. “Nabiullina has thought of resigning ever since the war started. But it would have direct consequences for her and her family,” the source said. But even if the political and business elites did openly revolt, questions remain about what real power they have over Putin, who has increasingly surrounded himself with former KGB agents and old friends as the pandemic increased his isolation. “The only people who could make a difference are those in uniform that command real soldiers like [minister of defence] Sergei Shoigu and [chief of the general staff of the armed forces] Valery Gerasimov,” said Gabuev. “But those men were directly involved in the preparation for the invasion. While they might not be happy about the scale of the current conflict, they have too much to lose to do something at this stage. They are also implicated,” Gabuev added.",News/World news,Dysfunction and self-deception stalk Kremlin but who will stand up to Putin?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/russia-vladimir-putin-ukraine-kremlin-mood
