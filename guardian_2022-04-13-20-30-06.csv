4/13/2022,"Russian Netflix users are suing the streaming firm for suspending its service as a result of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Netflix, which has only about 1 million subscribers in Russia, suspended its services in March and has halted the development and acquisition of all Russian-made or commissioned TV shows and films. A law firm has launched a class action legal action against Netflix, which has more than 220 million global subscribers, on behalf of Russian users who believe the decision to block access is a violation of their rights. The subscribers, who pay 599-799 roubles a month (£5.55-£9.26) to access content, from Bridgerton to Don’t Look Up, are demanding 60m roubles (£560,200) in compensation. “Today, a law firm representing the interests of Netflix users filed a class action lawsuit against the American Netflix service with the Khamovnichesky district court of Moscow,” the law firm Chernyshov, Lukoyanov & Partners said, according to a report by the news agency RIA. “The reason for the lawsuit was a violation of Russian users’ rights due to Netflix’s unilateral refusal to provide services in Russia.” Netflix had not yet responded to a request for comment. In February, Netflix said it would refuse to carry the 20 Russian free-to-air propaganda channels that service providers were meant to host under a new law to be introduced on 1 March. “Given the current situation, we have no plans to add these channels to our service,” the company said at the time. In December, the Russian media regulator, Roskomnadzor, added Netflix to its register for audiovisual services because it was reaching more than 100,000 subscribers. Last month, amid the Kremlin’s sweeping crackdown on western social media, a Russian court banned Facebook and Instagram in the country, labelling the platforms’ parent company, Meta, “extremist”. Access to Facebook and Instagram had already been restricted earlier in the month after Meta confirmed it was relaxing its policies on hate speech towards Russian soldiers and Putin in relation to the war in Ukraine. Meta later said the laxer rules would apply only to people posting from Ukraine.",News/Media,Netflix subscribers in Russia launch class action for loss of service,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/13/netflix-subscribers-russia-class-action-loss-service-ukraine

Ali Harbi Ali, 26, was convicted on Monday of the murder and of planning terrorist attacks on other MPs for two years before he killed Amess. Ali, from north London, had consumed extensive Islamic State propaganda before he attacked Amess at a constituency surgery at a church in Leigh-on-Sea in October 2021. The jury at the Old Bailey took less than 20 minutes to convict Ali, who had once wanted to be a doctor. The sentence was passed by Mr Justice Sweeney. He said so serious was the murder and the motives behind it “that the defendant must be kept in prison for the rest of his life”.

4/13/2022,"A former security guard at the British embassy in Berlin who is accused of spying for Russia will face a trial at the Old Bailey next year. David Smith, 57, allegedly passed secret information about the British government to a military attache. The Briton, who was living in Potsdam in the German capital, is accused of gathering information from the embassy and passing it to someone he believed was a representative of the Russian state, as well as other alleged offences, between October 2020 and August last year. Smith is facing nine charges under the Official Secrets Act. On Wednesday, Smith appeared before the Old Bailey by video link from Belmarsh high-security jail. Wearing a green shirt and blue jeans, he spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth before a timetable for the case was set. Mr Justice Sweeney said a trial would take place from 13 February next year at the Old Bailey. It will be heard by a high court judge and will take up to four weeks. A plea and case management hearing was set for 29 July. After the brief hearing, Smith was remanded into custody. Smith was arrested by German police last August, and was extradited to the UK earlier this month. The charges Smith faces include attempting “to communicate” by letter with “Gen Maj Sergey Chukhurov, the Russian military attache based out of the Russian embassy, Berlin”. The material he attempted to communicate allegedly “contained details about the activities, identities, addresses and telephone numbers of various members of Her Majesty’s civil service”. Smith allegedly committed acts “prejudicial” to the safety and interest of the state by gathering information classified as “secret” about the “activities of Her Majesty’s government”. He allegedly “collected material relating to the operation and layout of the British embassy in Berlin”, with that information thought or intended to be “useful to an enemy, namely the Russian state”. Smith also allegedly made unauthorised photocopies of documents and video recordings of the embassy’s CCTV system and “kept sim card packaging” he had been asked to dispose of.",News/UK news,Briton accused of spying for Russia at Berlin embassy to be tried at Old Bailey,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/13/briton-accused-of-spying-for-russia-at-berlin-embassy-to-be-tried-at-old-bailey
4/13/2022,"Outside cardamom’s native Asia, the biggest markets for this headily aromatic spice are the Arab world, where the crushed pods are commonly used to flavour coffee, and Scandinavia, where their contents flavour treats to go with coffee. In fact, it’s said that the average Swede consumes 60 times more cardamom than their American counterpart, mostly in the form of cakes, cookies and these gloriously sticky buns. Kardemummabulle, which are usually shaped into elegant knots of dough, may be less famous internationally than the puffed-up cinnamon versions beloved across the pond, but I prefer their smaller size and zestier flavour. Easy to make, and fun to shape, they’re also the perfect Easter holiday project. Bread flour is so called because its high protein content helps with gluten development, gluten being the thing that gives bread its springy texture, as opposed to the more delicate crumb of the average cake. Gluten also helps the dough trap air; bread made with plain flour, for example, tends to be denser as well as softer. The bun, therefore, presents us with a quandary: recipes using plain flour have a more tender interior, but sometimes don’t rise quite as well as those using bread or even 00 flour (that said, many recipes, such as Charlotte Druckmann’s for The New York Times, are American, and American plain flour tends to have a higher protein content than European plain flour, thanks to the different wheat involved). I make perfectly good buns with both plain flour (Druckmann, Swedish baking blogger and author Martin Johansson); bread flour (Swedish chef Magnus Nilsson, Swedish food writer Leila Lindholm and Danish cook and author Bronte Aurell); and very finely milled 00 flour (Danish food writer and cook Trine Hahnemann). But I like baker Sarah Lemanski’s mixture of strong and softer flours, which she uses at Nova Bakehouse in Leeds (which comes to me courtesy of baking enthusiast and journalist Felicity Spector), and which seem to offer a happy medium. If you have only one of them, however, don’t feel obliged to rush out and buy the other especially; just make up the same total weight of flour with it. Fresh yeast, as used in Scandinavia, is trickier to come by in the UK, though any supermarket with an in-house bakery should be able to give you a tub. Happily, as with dried versus fresh pasta, there’s no difference in quality between fresh and dried yeast – you just need to use it slightly differently. Here’s a link to a conversion table to suit what you have; note that you’ll have to bloom fresh or dried yeast before use. Interestingly, Andrea Geary of America’s Cooks Illustrated magazine tells me that she discovered that: “like cinnamon, cardamom has anti-fungal qualities that slow fermentation”, and suggests that the dough is so copiously spiced that one can up the yeast content to improve the rise without spoiling the flavour. And she’s right: this is one dough that can take it. There are, of course, many no doubt excellent recipes for sourdough buns, but on this point I am with Nilsson, who writes in his Nordic Baking Book: “I love buns, and I love a great hand-kneaded, stone-oven baked wholegrain sourdough loaf, too. But they are different things, and what increases the greatness of one cannot necessarily always be said to do the same to the other … I want my bun to be made with added yeast and not sourdough, because it promises a fast-leavening process, which in turn leaves a lot of primary sweetness left in the flour itself. The inherent sweetness of processed flour is what gives that mild weariness, which acts as such an amazing foundation for the aroma of sweet spices like cinnamon and cardamom to shine on.” Sourdough cardamom buns may be delicious, but the simple sweetness of yeasted dough allows the spices to shine. Most buns are made from an enriched dough, in which the basic flour, water and salt formula of bread is gilded with fat, in this case always butter and sometimes egg, with the water replaced by milk. (Johansson and West Yorkshire’s Triangle Bakehouse both use half milk, half water, which speeds up the fermentation time, but I think you lose a bit of softness in the dough, and I want these to feel like tucking into an unusually tasty feather duvet). Both Aurell and Nilsson melt their butter before use, Johansson specifies cold butter, as if making a laminated dough for something such as a croissant, and everyone else uses it softened, with Triangle kneading the dough for several minutes before incorporating it. Although I get decent results from all of the above, which suggests to me it doesn’t make a huge amount of difference, I call on Ian Lowe, late of Tasmania’s Apiece Bakery, for expert guidance. He kindly explains that “both melted and solid butter interfere with gluten cross-linking when added to dough, albeit in slightly different ways”, which indeed suggests that there’s no particular benefit in spending time rubbing in cold butter. (Interestingly, Lowe also suggests that, if I want a lighter, fluffier bread, I should increase the egg, decrease the milk and butter, use all plain flour and increase the sugar – at which point I decide that actually I miss the richness. Thanks for your help, though, Ian.) Nilsson’s baking bible includes three sweet bun dough recipes, noting that the first, plainest one is the most traditional – “it is the one that has been on the back of the wheat flour packets since for ever”. It is, however, now losing ground to newer recipes, he says, “which are mostly a bit richer”. I try the first, which contains a similar amount of milk and sugar to Hahnemann’s, but no egg, to compare with recipes on a sliding scale of richness, though there’s surprisingly little variation in the amount of butter used. Eggs, however, are more divisive, with Nilsson, Druckmann and Johansson all eschewing them, while Lemanski adds extra-virgin olive oil to her dough instead, which gives an incredibly soft crumb, but less richness of flavour. Eggs seem to help with the fluff factor, though, so I’m going to keep them in; if you’d prefer a plainer bun, leave them out and add a little more milk to bring it to a soft dough. (It also seems to me that they would be relatively easy to veganise, but I haven’t tried it myself.) Everyone adds a little sugar to the dough – though not too much: there should be a contrast between the bun and the filling – and most include salt, too. Nilsson says cardamom seeds in the dough itself are optional, but everyone uses them, and I’m not going to buck that trend; they give the bun a wonderful perfume and an attractively speckled appearance. (You can buy ready-ground cardamom, but it loses its aroma quickly, so I’m afraid I’d have to recommend doing the hard work yourself; Scandinavian suppliers sell cardamom husked, but removing the green pods is a pleasingly meditative activity as far as I’m concerned.) A few recipes, including Johansson, Lemanski and the Triangle’s, recommend retarding the dough by leaving it to rise slowly in the fridge, rather than at room temperature, which, the Yorkshire bakery tells me: “will make the dough taste greeaaaat, and [is] easier for the final shape!”. With so much spice involved, I can’t really taste the difference, but I can attest it makes stretching and filling the dough an awful lot less faff, because the dough is firmer and so more amenable to being topped with butter. It also makes timing a bit easier, because you can, to a certain extent, choose when to bake it, as opposed to being at the mercy of your yeast. They also, in my experience, rise slightly better, but the difference is not significant. More butter, obviously, and more sugar – white is common, but Lemanski and Aurell’s mix of brown and white brings a lovely, caramel flavour with it, while Aurell’s teaspoon of flour seems to help bind it, so less melts out of the buns during baking. (Not that that’s really a bad thing, given that it creates a crispy frill of toffee on the baking sheet, but I can see that, technically, that might be considered a fault.) Aurell and Lindholm also add cinnamon, and, in the former’s case, vanilla sugar to their fillings, and no doubt you could also put in ginger, or lemon zest, or anything else that pairs happily with cardamom, if you had a fancy to, but I’m sticking with cardamom. Cardamom buns are generally knotted, rather than rolled like the cinnamon sort. The principal difficulty with shaping is conveying the instructions in writing; I try several methods, and find Aurell’s video, for the buns made every day at her London shop and cafe, the ScandiKitchen, to be the easiest to follow, though, in fact, I, being not the most dextrous with dough at the best of time, eventually opt for the more common braided version, which yields more impressive-looking results in even the least talented of hands. (Aurell also gives instructions on her website for making them like cinnamon rolls, should you be looking for something a bit simpler.) Egg wash, though not mandatory (it does leave you with leftovers, which I dislike, but you can make fried rice with them, or indeed a tiny omelette for a dog), gives the buns a handsome, bronzed look, while a glaze – a simple sugar syrup, such as that favoured by Aurell and Johansson, or golden syrup (Lindholm and Nilsson) will provide the requisite stickiness, as well as increasing the buns’ shelf life. You could go all out and finish them off with cardamom sugar, as Nilsson suggests, or flaky vanilla sea salt, as Lemanski recommends, but I’m not entirely sure you need to; I do rather like the crunch of Aurell’s chopped hazelnuts, though. The buns are best eaten on the day of baking, though if you glaze them, they will stay good for a couple of days; in the unlikely event that you have leftovers after that, they make excellent bread-and-butter pudding, too. Dare I say it, but who needs hot cross buns?

Heat the milk to just below boiling point, then add the cardamom and butter, and leave to cool to blood temperature (about 37C). Whisk the flours, salt, sugar and yeast in a large bowl or food mixer, then add the milk and butter once it’s cool enough. Mix until well combined, then add the egg to bring it all together into a soft, but coherent dough; it should be a little sticky, but not too wet to handle. Knead the dough until it’s smooth and comes cleanly away from the bottom of the bowl (or work surface, if you’re kneading by hand); it doesn’t matter if it then sticks again. Cover and leave for an hour to get going, then put in the fridge for four to 12 hours (if you’d prefer to bake as soon as possible, keep it at room temperature until it’s grown considerably, though it may not quite double in size). Meanwhile, mix all the filling ingredients and line two baking trays. Once the dough is ready, put it on a lightly floured surface and roll out into a roughly 50cm x 30cm rectangle, with the short edge facing you. Spread the filling all over the surface (this is easiest with a butter or palette knife, or similar, but you can also use your hands). Fold the top third of the dough into the middle, then fold the bottom third up on top of it, as if folding a letter. Turn the dough 90 degrees, roll it out again, this time to about 50cm x 20cm, and cut into roughly 2½cm-wide strips. Cut the strips almost, but not quite, in half widthways, so they look a bit like pairs of trousers, stretch the “legs” slightly, then twist them together like plaits. Wind each plait into a coil around your finger, tucking the end through the middle to secure. (I would strongly recommend watching a video online before starting, though it’s not difficult, and there are other, equally valid techniques.) Arrange the buns, well spaced out, on the lined trays, cover and leave to rise again for an hour. Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, then brush the buns with egg and bake for 13-15 minutes, until golden; swap the trays around halfway through baking, so the buns all bake evenly. Meanwhile, heat the sugar with 50ml water, stirring until dissolved. When the buns come out of the oven, brush them with this syrup while they’re still hot. Before serving, you could also sprinkle them with some granulated sugar mixed with a little ground cardamom for extra crunch.

4/13/2022,"After Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak were issued with fixed-penalty notices for attending a lockdown-breaching party there has been much talk about the ministerial code and how it could affect their futures. But what is it? And what powers of enforcement are there? It is the rules and guidelines for how ministers should behave while in office. The most recent version, updated in 2019, is 31 pages long. The rules are based around the so-called seven principles of public life: selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership. The code was given its current name under Tony Blair in 1997, having been previously known as questions of procedure for ministers. It existed in that form from the second world war but was only published under John Major in 1992. While it does stress the “overarching duty on ministers to comply with the law”, the most pertinent section comes on the first page of the code: It is of paramount importance that ministers give accurate and truthful information to parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity. Ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the prime minister. Opposition parties argue that because both Johnson and Sunak denied in the Commons that they had attended illicit events, they have broken this section and must resign. No. At least not yet. The argument from both men, and their supporters, is that to mislead involves intent, and both say they honestly believed at the time that the event they have been fined for, a supposedly impromptu gathering for Johnson’s birthday on 19 June 2020 in the cabinet room, had been within the rules. This appears to have convinced enough Conservative MPs for them to be safe. What could make things tricky is if Johnson is fined for another party he attended that is also being investigated by police. Not as such. Sue Gray, a senior civil servant, has been tasked with writing a report into what happened with the parties – its publication now delayed for the police investigation – but this was commissioned by Johnson. The ministerial code is officially overseen by Christopher Geidt, the adviser on ministerial interests. He can only investigate alleged breaches of the code if requested by Johnson, although the plan is for this to change. In theory, yes; in practice, no. The code is very clear, especially on misleading parliament. And some departures have taken place. In 2017, Damian Green was sacked by Theresa May as first secretary of state after admitting he had lied about the presence of pornographic images on his Commons computer following an investigation by the then cabinet secretary, Jeremy Heywood. But three years later, Johnson refused to dismiss Priti Patel, the home secretary, after an inquiry found she had breached the code through bullying behaviour. This prompted Lord Geidt’s predecessor as adviser on ministerial interests Sir Alex Allan to quit. No. This code is only applicable for Westminster ministers, with the devolved UK governments having their own versions. The Scottish and Welsh codes are based on the Westminster one, and are also enforced by convention only. The Northern Ireland code has a statutory basis, set out in the legislation that set up the power-sharing government system.",News/Politics,Ministerial code: what is it and will it lead to Johnson and Sunak resigning?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/13/ministerial-code-what-is-it-boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-resigning
4/13/2022,"It is the Bank of England’s job to hit the government’s 2% inflation target, so from the perspective of Threadneedle Street policymakers there are a number of worrying aspects to the latest cost of living figures. Let’s start with the obvious: the annual inflation rate rose from 6.2% to 7% last month and is now at its highest level since early 1992: that’s a long way north of the official target. Then there’s the speed at which price pressures have surfaced. A year ago, the annual inflation rate was only 0.7%: the increase in magnitude in the 12 months since is unprecedented. The pickup in inflation is also broad-based. Clearly, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has given an added twist to the problem by jacking up energy costs but there is more to it than that. Food, eating out, clothing and furniture have all become more expensive. What’s more, there is worse to come. When the April inflation figures are released next month they will include the 54% increase in the energy price cap – which alone will add about 1.8 percentage points to the annual inflation rate. Even allowing for the 5p-a-litre reduction in fuel duty announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in his spring statement, the annual inflation rate in April is going to climb well above 8% and – given that in every recent month the figure has surprised on the upside – could well be about 9%. Finally, high inflation is going to stick around for a while. While in the summer there should be some reduction in the annual rate, there is likely to be another rise in the autumn when the energy price cap is again adjusted. Inflation will remain at 7% or above for the rest of 2022. The strength and persistence of inflation creates economic and political problems for the government. Stagflation – a toxic combination of stagnant output and rising inflation – is a racing certainty but there is also a risk of an intensifying squeeze on living standards caused by prices rising faster than wages, driving the economy into recession. Sunak will face demands to do more to help mitigate the impact of price rises. A combination of falling real incomes plus Partygate spells real trouble for Boris Johnson’s administration, and raises further questions about why the chancellor failed to act more decisively on the cost of living crisis in last month’s mini-budget. One reason why the onus is on Sunak is that voters can expect little assistance from the Bank. The next meeting of its monetary policy committee in early May will coincide with the 25th anniversary of Gordon Brown’s decision to grant Threadneedle Street operational independence. Despite the obvious risks of harming an already weakening economy, the Bank is expected to mark the occasion by raising interest rates for a fourth meeting in row.",News/Business,Stagflation looks a racing certainty as worse to come for UK households | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/13/stagflation-looks-a-racing-certainty-as-worse-to-come-for-uk-households
4/13/2022,"This year’s traditional Easter double-header could be the last time fans get to experience one of the highlights of the Super League calendar amid a player-led push to improve welfare. The Rugby League Players Association, which represents professional rugby league players in the UK, has held talks with the Rugby Football League to bring an end to periods such as Easter – during which many Super League players endure two games in 72 hours and three in as few as nine days – from as early as next season. Garreth Carvell, the former Great Britain prop who heads the union, said removal of congested fixture periods such as this weekend’s is common sense when it comes to prioritising player welfare, adding that more or less every player he has consulted is of the belief double-header weekends must now be a thing of the past. “We are happy to have this discussion on behalf of the players now,” Carvell told the Guardian. “We’ve spoke with the RFL and we’ll also speak with the clubs. It’s the clubs that hold the power but the RFL’s main strategy for 2022 was about player feedback, and acting on behalf of what the players want. With issues like this, we’ll see whether those words have meaning.” The Guardian understands that while the RFL would be receptive to removing double-header weekends, there may be less warmth to the idea from clubs, who generate significant revenue over Easter in comparison with normal weekends, with the bank holiday bump in crowds providing a much-needed financial boost. The RLPA wants to ensure that minimum periods of five days between all fixtures are introduced to guarantee players can recover adequately between games and reduce the risk of injury. Carvell said: “I’ve had the discussion with the players and they just want to be able to play as much as they can, but with proper rest. “I understand that might not be 100% possible if the broadcasters decide you’re playing on a Thursday evening after a Sunday fixture, but we speak a lot about player welfare in rugby league and from the players’ point of view, throwing them into three games in nine days isn’t safe. It just isn’t. If we’re serious and not just ticking boxes, that’s going to have to change.” Easter is often one of the most anticipated periods of the domestic rugby league season, with every club playing twice in a matter of days. After four Thursday night matches, Good Friday has two of the biggest derbies in the game, with sell-out crowds in attendance for Hull Kingston Rovers’ meeting with Hull FC, before St Helens host Wigan later in the afternoon. All clubs will play again on Easter Monday before a full round of fixtures the following weekend. “It’s that third game, when the players have been through so much already, when things begin to suffer,” Carvell added. “The players just want one game a weekend and adequate recovery periods. “I know the clubs will have a lot to say about it, as they see it as a good way to earn money, but this is about improving the game and the welfare of players long term.” The RFL has been approached for comment.",Sport/Sport,Rugby league’s players’ union calls for Easter double-headers to be dropped,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/13/rugby-league-players-union-calls-for-easter-double-headers-to-be-dropped
4/13/2022,"Swipe right! Swipe left! No, it’s not the opening of Tinder: The Stage Show, although there is plenty of canoodling going on in one of the early scenes. After all, how can you tell the legend of Zorro without some smouldering and seduction alongside the swordplay? All of the key ingredients of a classic Zorro storyline are present in this new musical, from the cruel villain oppressing the peasants in a Los Angeles pueblo to the sultry-slash-feisty love interests our masked hero must choose between. And it’s presented with flamenco flair, with songs by the Gipsy Kings, those enduring monarchs of Latin pop, set to an original story by Helen Edmundson (Small Island) and lyricist Stephen Clark (Martin Guerre). Paige Fenlon is Luisa, who brings her childhood friend Diego home from his Spanish rumspringa to confront his despotic brother Ramón (Alex Gibson-Giorgio); Phoebe Panaretos is Inez, the fiery Gypsy queen who sparks his inner Zorro. The women command the stage, including a five-strong female chorus whose impassioned lament for their broken village is the show’s most powerful moment. There’s huge verve, too, in the full-company numbers, courtesy of a couple of the Gipsy Kings’ most famous tunes, to the accompaniment of actor-musicians playing trumpets, fiddles and accordion. The whiff of hamminess is never absent from the Zorro films and here both script and performances are endearingly alive to a sense of the ridiculous; Marc Pickering’s Sergeant Garcia is a particularly joyous comic confection. The problem is that, aside from swaggering masculinity, the characters of the duelling antagonists feel more flimsily set up than the plywood facades of a spaghetti western. Ramón’s daddy issues become increasingly histrionic, and as for Diego/Zorro himself, a couple of solos and some backstory with puppets tell us that he is our hero-in-waiting without ever demonstrating why. Benjamin Purkiss bounds about the stage in capers with his cape, and his voice is heard at its best in Diego’s lovely duet with Luisa, but it’s hard to distinguish a sense of the man behind the mask. Still, it’s easy to get swept up in the fervent energy of this melodrama-with-castanets.

4/13/2022,"If you scroll down Jimmy Anderson’s Instagram page, it is hard not to notice that he is a man in fine physical fettle. Among the de rigueur golf days and regular gym sessions there are shots of Anderson on a windswept beach, running and stuff, looking healthy and flogging vitamin supplements. It’s almost as if Big Vita want you to think that you, too – yes you in your crumb-flecked joggers, you with your lapsed gym membership, your lame excuses, your two KitKat Chunkies in front of MasterChef of an evening – you could be as lithe and lean as Jimmy if only you popped down a 2mg pill of first-pressing cod livers each day. Well, yeah right, dream on. Anderson is 39 years old and in phenomenal nick. He has spent more than half of his life as a professional sportsman, training, nutritioning, focused and committed to his goal. That 20 years of graft has seen him become England’s all-time record wicket-taker in Test cricket. You took the bins out last night, big whoop. Anderson shared his latest photo on Monday, some fresh content for his 746,000 followers. The post shows his first squad photo for Lancashire, a cherubic, frosted-tipped youth in 2002, his boyish good looks enough to get him into any early 00s pop band. In the second photo, his most recent Lancashire squad picture snapped a few days ago, his stubble has spread and is greying at the chin and there are more laughter lines, but, if anything the Jimmy of 2022 looks in even better condition than the Jimmy of two decades previous. “The highlights are now greys but the enthusiasm is the same. Can’t wait to get going,” he writes. Anderson will no doubt feel a little different at the start of this county season. For the first time he will be genuinely unsure as to whether he has played his final Test for England. Part of him must be preparing for the possibility that it’s all over. While a proud Lancastrian who enjoys representing his county whenever he can, for the past 15 years Anderson’s run-outs for the Red Rose have largely been an exercise in returning to, maintaining or proving his fitness for England. Uphill spells into the wind at Southport in September will surely feel different if they aren’t part of some bigger picture. There are those who think the way Anderson has been treated by his England and Wales Cricket Board employers is a kick in his well-aligned teeth. That it is a travesty after all he has given for English cricket for it to end like this, with a squib rather than a spectacle. Some think he should be allowed to go out on his own terms, that he has earned that right. Others, with a cold glint in the eye, know sport doesn’t really work like that. As any fan of any sports team of any standard will know, sport doesn’t give a toss about your feelings. Couldn’t give a fig for sentimentality. It’s little wonder that when it comes to sporting sign-offs, only a sparse few get to curate their own final bow. Cricket is no different. For every Nasser Hussain creaming his final ball in Test cricket to the Lord’s boundary to secure a thrilling win there is a Kevin Pietersen, whose final act in the format was to make scores of three and six at Sydney in the Ashes drubbing of 2013-14. Eight years and seemingly a lifetime since his thrilling debut in 2005, KP was duly dropped for looking “disengaged”, in the words of Paul Downton, then managing director of England cricket. Despite his best efforts, Pietersen never played for England again. For every career that ends in a teammate shoulder hoist and a valedictory ground lap there is one that ends in a tearful press conference or more latterly a rueful tweet. Even the great Don Bradman suffered at the hands of the game’s icy disdain for sentiment, famously bowled for a duck at the Oval in 1948 by Eric Hollies after a final, perhaps tearful walk to the crease. Andrew Strauss, the man who dealt Anderson his current predicament in a well-documented (if only in duration) five-minute phone call is no stranger to anticlimactic endings. His final Test in 2012 was overshadowed by the fallout from Pietersen (that man again) texting his mates in the South Africa dressing room. Fitting finales and heartfelt swansongs are as much about the fans in the crowd and supporters sitting at home as they are for those on the pitch. To give the sporting public the opportunity to say thank you and goodbye, to give the punters a sense of closure. You can imagine Anderson, shy and famously – if knowingly – curmudgeonly off the field, enjoying the spectacle of an emotional, potentially mawkish or overblown goodbye far less than say, Stuart Broad. Anderson may yet play for England again, as early as the first Test of the summer against New Zealand, starting on 2 June at Lord’s. He certainly made it clear in interviews this week that he doesn’t feel done yet. A final and fitting bow may yet be in store. He is clearly as photogenic and as fit or fitter as he was at the start of his career, the years have been kind in that regard. But sport isn’t always as kind and certainly isn’t scripted. An experienced campaigner of more than 20 years, Anderson will well know this. And it will no doubt be adding to his sense of early-season unease.

4/13/2022,"Darcy Ogada rarely spots raptors​ from her home in central Kenya any more. ​The birds were once ​a ​common​ ​​sight in the industrial town of Thika, 25 miles (40km) north of Nairobi, but the ​region’s ​forests are rapidly declining, and the few remaining raptor populations face the added threats of poison and persecution. “It is a disaster,” says Ogada, “Every day I go out of the house and look into the sky, I am disappointed. I might see the extinction of these birds in my lifetime.” Ogada works for the Peregrine Fund and was among a team of Kenyan and international scientists who recently published a report detailing widespread declines of Kenya’s birds of prey over the past 40 years. Numbers of common kestrel were down by 95%; secretary bird and long-crested eagles 94%; lesser kestrels 93%; and the augur buzzard down 91%. Both the hooded vulture and Montagu’s harrier saw an 88% decline. “We are on the brink of losing many of them, along with the environmental benefits they confer to humanity,” says Peter Njoroge, head of the ornithology section at National Museums of Kenya. “Most birds of prey are slow breeders and cannot cope with the myriad threats they face unless urgent action to protect them is initiated.” The study, published in February in the Biological Conservation journal, involved a team of scientists from Kenya, the UK, France and the US, who conducted road surveys from 2003 until 2020, covering routes previously surveyed in the 1970s. They measured changes in raptor numbers between the two periods to identify species showing significant declines and gauge the effectiveness of protected areas. According to the scientists, factors contributing to rapid raptor decline include habitat fragmentation as a result of infrastructure development, widespread deforestation and a sharp rise in human population growth, which has resulted in a landscape that is less resilient to the effects of the climate crisis. Agriculture and livestock development have also led to degraded ecosystems unable to sustain wildlife. “A sharp increase in livestock numbers in recent decades has led to overgrazing, reducing grass cover and small mammal populations, diminishing the prey base for raptors. The result is a biologically impoverished landscape that is less resilient to climatic changes and provides fewer ecosystem services, and where attitudes toward wildlife have become increasingly intolerant,” says the report. Raptor numbers declined less severely in parks and reserves compared with unprotected lands, underlining the importance of protected areas for remaining populations, say the researchers. “Our findings highlight the stark contrast between raptor trends in protected areas and in unprotected land. Outside Kenya’s protected area network there is evidence that raptor populations have almost collapsed, and this cuts across species size, diet or ecological requirements,” says Philip Shaw at the University of St Andrews. Simon Thomsett, a director at Kenya Bird of Prey Trust, a raptor rescue and rehabilitation organisation, says there has been little effort to save raptors compared with animals such as elephants, lions or rhinos, which rank highly in the tourism world. “You have some conservationists who judge the health of the ecosystem with the increase in elephants. But the elephant would hardly survive if the raptors were not there to clean up the environment,” he says. “If the figures [of raptor decline in Kenya] were witnessed in Europe, Japan or any other part of the developed world, there would be panic and people would do everything to save them. We have seen people getting permits to have noisy social events in places like Hell’s Gate national park in the Rift valley where Rüppel’s vultures breed, with long-term effects on the raptors.” The experts are also concerned about deliberate and incidental poisoning of raptors, and fear the long term effects of recent large-scale spraying of locusts in northern Kenya on raptors that fed on the dead insects. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization says: “Chemical pesticides used in locust control can pose risks to human and animal health … Some do pose low to medium risk to mammals, including domestic livestock and fish. Most present high risks to honeybees and other beneficial species.” Poisons used to kill predators such as lions and hyenas that attack livestock are also taking their toll on birds of prey. While the poison may succeed in killing a few predators, it is raptors, especially vultures, that die in large numbers. Thomsett says: “Farmers may be targeting hyenas, but it is the vultures that eat the carcasses. Now, we are having plenty of carcasses with fewer scavengers. Killing a raptor is still a wildlife crime like killing a rhino, yet we rarely hear of any arrests as a result of killing a raptor.” Despite the threats to Kenya’s raptors, the authors suggest that declines could be reversed through enhanced management of protected areas, the mitigation of specific threats, and the implementation of species recovery plans.

4/13/2022,"Ever since entering Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene has been making headlines for her long history of peddling conspiracy theories, her blatant embrace of anti-Muslim bigotry and white Christian nationalism, and her aggression against political opponents. The latest escalation came last week, when she smeared her Republican colleagues in the Senate, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins and Mitt Romney, as “pro-pedophile” after they voted to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the US supreme court; Democrats, she added, “are the party of pedophiles.” There is a calculating quality to Greene’s polemics. Last fall, for instance, she recorded a campaign video in which she used a military-grade sniper rifle to blow up a car that had the word “socialism” written on it, promising to do the same to the “Democrats’ socialist agenda.” It was over-exaggerated campaign nonsense. But Greene knew the unsubtle insinuation of using violence against a political opponent would demand attention. The fact that Greene’s antics are so clearly designed to keep herself in the spotlight has prompted calls for the media and commentators to stop paying attention to her rather than be complicit in the amplification of far-right propaganda. And if what’s on display here were just the extremist behavior of a fringe figure, it would indeed be best to simply ignore her. This, however, isn’t just Greene’s extremism – it is increasingly that of the Republican party itself. Greene and the many provocateurs like her are not just rightwing trolls, but elected officials in good standing with their party. Ignoring them won’t work, nor will making fun of them: These people are in positions of influence, fully intent on using their power. In any (small-d) democratic party, Greene’s extremism should be disqualifying. In today’s Republican party, she’s not being expelled, she’s being elevated. Greene is undoubtedly one of the rightwing stars in the country, and that’s not just a media phenomenon. Republican candidates crave her endorsement. Democrats stripped her of her committee assignments against the vote of nearly all of Greene’s Republican colleagues; if the Republicans capture the House in November, she’ll probably get those assignments back. It is true that occasionally, Greene’s most egregious actions have led to some measure of symbolic distancing from Republican leadership. After she spoke at the white supremacist America First Political Action Conference (Afpac) in February, where she was enthusiastically introduced and embraced by the well-known far-right activist and Nazi sympathizer Nick Fuentes, minority leader Kevin McCarthy gave her a good talking to – but no serious consequences followed. Overall, Greene’s position within the Republican party seems secure. That’s partly because the Republican leadership is surely aware that most of the energy and activism in conservatism is in the far-right wing that stands behind Greene. In fact, Greene is the poster child of a rising group of rightwing radicals: in Congress, she likes to present herself and like-minded allies such as representatives Lauren Boebert and Matt Gaetz as the future of the Republican party, and they aren’t shy about their intention to purge whatever vestiges of “moderate” conservatism might still exist within the Republican party. Greene’s rise is indicative of a more openly militant form of white Christian nationalism inserting itself firmly at the center of Republican politics. “America First” candidates like Greene are representing the Republican party all over the country. In Arizona, for instance, state senator Wendy Rogers proudly declared herself to “stand with Jesus, Robert E Lee, and the Cleveland Indians” back in December – all of them supposedly “canceled” by “satanic communists”; and at the aforementioned AFPAC in February, Rogers suggested building gallows to hang political enemies. In Georgia, gubernatorial candidate Kandiss Taylor runs on a platform of “Jesus, Guns, and Babies” and openly advocates for the establishment of a Christian theocracy. The Republican party doesn’t just tolerate such extremists in an attempt to appease the fringe – this isn’t simply a matter of acquiescence out of convenience or cowardice. What we really need to grapple with is the fact that this sort of radicalism is widely seen as justified on the right. The exact language someone like Greene uses might be slightly crasser than what some conservatives are comfortable with, and some Republicans might disagree with specific aspects of the public image she projects. But it’s obviously not enough for them to break with her, or with any of the Christian nationalist extremists in their ranks. If anything, most of what Greene is saying actually aligns with the general thrust of conservative politics. Republicans are currently all in on smearing anyone who disagrees with their assault on LGBTQ rights as “groomers” and declaring any progressive social position adjacent to pedophilia. And it’s really hard to tell the difference between Greene’s propaganda and what much of the reactionary intellectual sphere has been producing. Rod Dreher, for instance, one of the Religious Right’s best-known exponents, has called the Democrats the “party of groomers” and “the party of child mutilators and kidnappers” lately. Or take the gun-toting militancy that was on display in Greene’s campaign video. Republicans have long embraced the gun cult and made it a key element of their political identity. Now candidates up and down the country have the whole family, including young children, pose for heavily armed photos, reveling in the imagery of using guns to fight off those insidious Democrats and their assault on America. That’s precisely the key to understanding why so many Republicans are willing to embrace political extremism. Greene’s central message is fully in line with what has become dogma on the right: that Democrats are a radical, “Un-American” threat, and have to be stopped by whatever means. Everyone suspected of holding liberal or progressive positions is a “fellow traveler with the radical left,” as senator Ted Cruz put it; as part of the “militant left,” Democrats need to be treated as the “the enemy within,” according to senator Rick Scott; and Florida governor Ron DeSantis declared that Stacey Abrams winning the Georgia gubernatorial election would be akin to a foreign adversary taking over and lead to a “cold war” between the two neighboring states. It doesn’t matter to the right that Greene’s pedophilia accusations lack any empirical basis. What matters is that they adhere to the higher truth of conservative politics: that Democrats are a fundamental threat to the country, to its moral foundations, its very survival. “How much more can America take before our civilization begins to collapse?” Greene asked last week. There aren’t many conservatives left who disagree with her assessment. That’s how they are giving themselves permission to embrace whatever radical measures are deemed necessary to defeat this “Un-American” enemy. Once you have convinced yourself you are fighting a noble war against a bunch of pedophiles hellbent on destroying the nation, there are no more lines you’re not justified to cross. Greene and her fellow extremists are perceived to be useful shock troops in an existential struggle for the survival of “real” America. The right isn’t getting distracted by debates over whether Greene’s militant extremism or Mitch McConnell’s extreme cynicism are the right approach to preventing multiracial pluralism. They are united in the quest to entrench white reactionary rule. I fear that four years of Trumpism in power so inundated us with political stunts and outrageous political acts that we might have become a bit numb to how extreme and dangerous these developments are. Let’s not be lulled into a false sense of security by the clownishness, the ridiculousness of it all. Some of history’s most successful authoritarians were considered goons and buffoons by their contemporaries – until they became goons and buffoons in power. What we are witnessing is one party rapidly abandoning and actively assaulting the foundations of democratic political culture. Every “Western” society has always harbored some far-right extremists like Greene. But the fact that the Republican party embraces and elevates people like her constitutes an acute danger to democracy.

4/13/2022,"A loophole in government regulations means that chickens can still be called free-range even though they are no longer allowed outside because of the outbreak of avian flu. The UK has been affected by what government officials have called the “largest ever outbreak of avian flu” over the winter, with almost 100 reported highly pathogenic outbreaks in England, Scotland and Wales. All birds reared for meat and eggs have been ordered by the UK government to be kept indoors since November to reduce the risk of outbreaks. As a result, free-range eggs now have to carry a sticker or label saying they are “barn eggs” – the name given to eggs produced by hens permanently housed indoors. But producers who sell their chickens for meat do not have to inform consumers that birds are not allowed outdoors. UK officials have said that chicken producers can retain their free-range status so long as birds are not housed for more than 12 weeks. Free-range birds, which are usually slaughtered at about eight weeks, do not live long enough for the labelling rules to apply.“It’s a terrible situation for farmers, but if a free-range chicken has never been allowed outdoors in its life that should be made clear to consumers,” said Peter Stevenson, the chief policy adviser for Compassion in World Farming. The situation could get worse, with leading disease experts telling the Guardian last month that free-range production may no longer be feasible in the UK due to a dramatic escalation in avian flu outbreaks.In past years, outbreaks of avian flu dropped with warmer weather and the end of the wild-bird migration in autumn and winter months. But disease is continuing to spread in the UK, with five more outbreaks on poultry farms in Cambridgeshire, Somerset, Suffolk and Devon in the past week.“The ecology [of avian flu] has changed drastically in just a few years. We now have local circulation all year round in Europe, it’s not just a seasonal threat,” said Marion Koopmans, a virologist and adviser to the World Health Organization. One free-range chicken producer who spoke to the Guardian said it was a “nightmare” scenario for them, but that they were explaining the situation to any customer who asked.“I am still convinced that we’ll have the birds out by the end of May, but if [indoor housing] continues much longer, the government will have to change the policy and enforce the housing of birds on a regional basis depending on where outbreaks are,” said the chicken producer.The market for free-range chickens is still tiny in comparison to the demand for free-range eggs. Last year, almost two-thirds of 11bn eggs produced in the UK were free-range. In contrast, less than 4% of chicken meat sold is free-range or organic.The Co-op, Sainsbury’s, M&S, Morrisons and Waitrose no longer stock eggs that are not free-range. However, they all sell chicken meat that comes from birds that are never allowed outdoors.A spokesperson for the British Poultry Council said: “There are no plans to let consumers know as there is no time limit on the derogation to house birds for meat under the poultry meat marketing regulations, unlike eggs which have a derogation to house birds for 16 weeks only.” Stevenson said the forced housing of birds made it essential for the UK government to take steps to improve the regulations on chicken sheds. “The barn accommodation has to be an awful lot better with more enrichment, straw and improved indoor areas,” he said.",News/Environment,"UK chickens can be ‘free-range’ despite never going outside, due to loophole",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/13/uk-chickens-can-be-free-range-despite-never-going-outside-thanks-to-loophole
4/13/2022,"Extremely active Atlantic hurricane seasons are now twice as likely as they were in the 1980s due to global heating, according to new research that warns the climate crisis is supersizing storms that threaten life and property in coastal areas. Climate breakdown has contributed to a “decisive increase” in intense hurricane activity since 1982, the study states. Researchers in Germany and Switzerland who undertook the analysis wrote that the growing hyperactivity of storms could be “robustly ascribed” to the rising temperature of the oceans. The warming of the sea surface has “contributed significantly to more extreme tropical cyclone seasons and thereby to the fatalities, destruction and trillion-dollar losses that these cyclones have caused over the last four decades”, the research added. Previous research has shown that while the number of hurricanes – often called cyclones when they happen in the Pacific – may not increase drastically due to climate change, the events themselves appear to be getting stronger and more destructive. A storm is considered a hurricane when it reaches sustained winds of 74mph or more and is measured between category 1 and 5 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale for severity. This intensification of storms, in which the energy and moisture held by a swirling hurricane is boosted by elevated heat from the ocean and atmosphere, has manifested itself in numerous recent disasters, including Hurricane Maria, a category 5 hurricane that reached 174mph and devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, and Hurricane Florence, a powerful category 4 storm that smashed into the US east coast a year later. “While the attribution of individual tropical cyclone events remains difficult, there can be no doubt that climate change is creating more intense storms,” said Peter Pfleiderer, a scientist at the Berlin-based Climate Analytics, who led the study. “Our results do not imply that increasing sea-surface temperatures lead to more tropical cyclones – but point towards a trend of more intense storms and therefore more extreme outcomes for seasons with many tropical cyclones.” Separate research released this week found that climate breakdown is increasing the amount of rainfall that occurs during a major storm, as well as helping intensify the storm itself. An analysis of the 2020 hurricane season, when a record 30 named storms stirred from the Atlantic, found that global heating heightened extreme rainfall over three-hour periods by 11% compared with what would be expected in pre-industrial times. The study, which “hindcasted” the 2020 hurricane season with a computer model that showed what would have happened if climate change were not occurring, found that coastal communities are now at greater risk from deadly flooding from thunderous bursts of storm rainfall. This sort of intensification caused more than 20 people to die from flooding, many of them while trapped in basement apartments, in New York and New Jersey in October when the remnants of Hurricane Ida, which had already ravaged New Orleans, still had the strength to travel across a broad sweep of the eastern US. “You get a bigger climate signal with the more intense storms. With stronger wind speeds, you get more water evaporation and see this sort of flooding,” said Kevin Reed, a climate scientist at Stony Brook University who led the research, published in Nature Communications. “Climate change is often thought of as a distant problem but the reality is that climate change is here, our climate has changed and one of the clearest ways we can see that is through changes in extreme weather, such as hurricanes. “As the world continues to warm, storms are going to get rainier and rainier. We are really going to have to get our act together in dealing with this.” This year’s Atlantic hurricane season, which is expected to be more active than usual, starts on 1 June and runs until 30 November.",News/World news,Extreme Atlantic hurricane seasons now twice as likely as in 1980s,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/hurricanes-atlantic-climate-change-tropical-cyclones
4/13/2022,"The nation’s anti-union consultants and lawyers – who have made millions of dollars fighting against union drives – have just been through some of their worst weeks ever as unions racked up wins at Amazon, Starbucks, REI, the New York Times, MIT and other places. These consultants and lawyers – often called “union busters” – have done so poorly that John Logan, a professor who has studied “union avoidance” efforts for two decades, says their anti-union kryptonite seems to have suddenly lost much of its power. “For decades, the consultants have seemed almost invincible. Many firms have boasted victory rates of over 95%,” said Logan, a professor at San Francisco State. But in Staten Island, “the Amazon Labor Union turned the tables on the company’s anti-union consultants” and showed they may have been “more of a liability than an asset”. Logan said anti-union consultants are often no longer as effective because workers and their attitudes have changed: workers, especially younger workers, are braver about speaking out, they’re using social media to outmaneuver the consultants, and they’re embracing highly effective strategies, like worker-to-worker organizing and interrupting so-called captive audience meetings, where consultants discuss the supposed evils of unions. Logan said workers often used to be far more scared to stand up to anti-union consultants, and one reason workers are less frightened is that the low jobless rate makes it easier for workers to find another job if they get fired for supporting a union. “They survived the pandemic, and they’re no longer so fearful,” Logan said. “The pandemic was such a frightening experience that workers have recalibrated their sense of risk about what they’re prepared to do in their lives. They’re more prepared to join a union campaign. They feel they’ve repeatedly been disrespected while their employers were making billions of dollars.” Logan was impressed that workers interrupted several of Amazon’s captive audience meetings. “The fact that they had the courage to do that helps show that something has fundamentally changed,” he said. “The mechanism of the captive audience meeting is much less successful if someone gets up and challenges what they’re saying. It all crumbles away.” Angelika Maldonado, a 27-year-old packer at Amazon’s Staten Island warehouse, was one of the workers who interrupted a captive audience meeting. She and other workers challenged Amazon’s assertion that workers might see their wages cut if they unionize. She also sought to rebut one of Amazon’s main arguments. “They put out all this propaganda that we were a third party,” Maldonado said. “Once we gained the trust of workers, they would see we are not a third-party union.” Rather, she explained, we are Amazon workers like them who created a union. Some Staten Island worker-organizers outed the anti-union consultants who walked the warehouse floor, urging workers to vote against unionizing. Workers sought to learn their names, and once they did, they tweeted out the consultant’s name and photo and urged workers not to talk to them. They further undermined the consultants’ effectiveness by highlighting that some of them earned $3,200 a day. Maldonado said: “We did some calculations and showed that instead of paying these union busters all this money, Amazon could have given everyone in the building a raise.” Wilma Liebman, chair of the National Labor Relations Board during president Obama’s first term, said anti-union consultants have grown less effective because they haven’t kept up with the changing workforce. “It’s hard to imagine how any of these union busters succeed. Almost all are old white guys,” she said. “They seek to demonstrate control with some intimidation factor. Whether these workers are white, African American or something else, it’s still a culture clash. It’s hard to imagine that the message of these consultants has much resonance.” Liebman added: “One way the consultants seem to be as effective as ever is in convincing employers to buy their services.” Some anti-union lawyers charge more than $1,200 an hour. A longtime management-side labor lawyer in Washington, who insisted on anonymity, said the recent string of union victories doesn’t mean that anti-union lawyers and consultants have become less effective. “More has been made of this than it should be,” he said. “I think it’s very situational.” He noted that unionization drives lost recently at a Hershey’s factory in Virginia and at HelloFresh food-packing facilities. (At those places, the workers didn’t challenge the anti-union consultants nearly as much as they did at Amazon or Starbucks.) The lawyer acknowledged that young workers are “challenging authority” more than their parents’ generation. “I think workers are more skeptical of what people say. They’re more willing to challenge, perhaps, than they were in the past.” A second lawyer, a partner at one of the nation’s leading anti-union law firms, also insisting on anonymity, said that workers’ smart use of social media has undercut union avoidance efforts. “The internet and social media have made employees much more savvy,” he said. “They’ve able to communicate better with each other and see different sources of information. I think social media has changed – and maybe leveled – the playing field.” Rebecca Givan, a professor of labor studies at Rutgers, said: “Young workers are more excited to speak up and counteract them, by, for instance, talking up in a captive audience meeting, challenging the supposed facts in a presentation. These are really new things.” Young workers are too young to remember Ronald Reagan’s busting the air-traffic controllers union. Many have been emboldened by Bernie Sanders and by the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements. Many young workers feel angry and squeezed by large student debt loads and soaring rents. Givan said social media has helped inoculate workers against anti-union consultants: “When workers are rapidly able to share anti-union talking points and see that they use the same arguments at different companies and workplaces, that it’s all cookie cutter, all from the same playbook, it shows how tired their tactics and rhetoric are.” Richard Bensinger, an organizer with Workers United who helped lead the Starbucks’ unionization campaign, said new technologies have helped overcome the union-avoidance consultants. “I don’t think we could have done this without Zoom and virtual meetings and partners talking to partners,” he said. (Partners is the term Starbucks uses to describe its workers.) Thus far, workers have voted in favor of unionizing at 18 of the 19 Starbucks where votes have been counted, and workers at more than 200 Starbucks have petitioned for unionization elections. “As far as inoculation, we get Samantha from the New York Roastery, which just voted to unionize, to speak to people at the Starbucks in Austin, Texas, telling them what to expect from the anti-union folks,” Bensinger said. Some Amazon and Starbucks workers have used TikTok to get out their pro-union message and WhatsApp and Telegram to spread the word and answer workers’ questions. Bensinger said the anti-union consultants and lawyers are still plenty effective, but often fall short. He noted that at one Buffalo Starbucks, 100% of the workers signed pro-union cards, but the union won there just 15 to 9. He said the solidarity and activism of the young workers was key to defeating the anti-union lawyers and consultants. “Young workers will only take so much,” he said. “A worker in Montana told me, ‘I’m making just $11 an hour and making Howard Schultz rich.’ Unions today are their big hope.”",News/US news,Wave of union victories suggests union-busting consultants may have lost their sway,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/13/union-victories-busting-consultants-amazon-tactics
4/13/2022,"When inflation was last running at 7% Margaret Daly was training to be a teacher and bringing up a young family, so money was tight. “In the early 1990s I was studying,” she says. “That was very difficult. I had two small children and I was always trying to make ends meet. When I qualified it took a few years after all that struggling and living frugally to find my feet.” As the 90s wore on, things improved for Margaret, now 60, as she progressed through her career and saved up enough to buy a home. Throughout the rest of the decade and the early 2000s her salary rose, against a backdrop of inflation that was typically 1.5-2.5%. When the recession hit in 2009 she weathered the storm. But now, four years after she retired, things are getting harder for Margaret, who lives in Colchester. “At the beginning of retirement the pension I was getting was enough – I live comfortably; I could buy what I wanted to buy; I could save a bit of it.” During the pandemic, there was not much to spend money on. But now she says her bucket list has “gone out of the window” and she is “starting to worry because everything has gone up”. “I’m having to be a bit more savvy when I shop – when I go to Tesco I get the Clubcard offers or look for the yellow stickers. I’ll buy the fruit and veg that’s on offer.” In Norwich her son Jon, who works for the insurance company Aviva, and daughter-in-law Jess, who works for the University of East Anglia, both 35 with an 13-month-old daughter, Robin, and a cat called Polly, have noticed the same. The Dalys, who first spoke to the Guardian about their soaring bills late last year, are also thinking twice before putting anything in their trolley. “There are non-essential items that I just don’t buy any more,” says Jess. “Things like Marmite – I looked at it and it was more than £3 so I’m not buying it now. Those kind of things aren’t on offer any more.” She and Jon do not eat meat and try to shop for products that are not covered in plastic packaging, but she says priorities have had to change. “When things are getting more expensive the priority is going to be what’s affordable, not what’s sustainable.” Heating is a big problem and is playing on the minds of both households. Jess and Jon are still on a fixed-rate tariff with British Gas, which is due to finish at the end of April, and are wondering what to do then. Currently there are no good fixed rates available, and their best bet will probably be their provider’s standard variable tariff – the one capped by the regulator, Ofgem. When we last spoke to the couple analysts were suggesting the price-capped tariff would hit £1,660 this April, which seemed shocking enough. Instead, it came in at £1,971, more than £300 extra, and so the family is expecting a sizeable increase when their current rate ends. They recently received an email from British Gas spelling out the increase: the unit cost of gas is rising from 3.3p to 7.3p per kWh and the standing charge will go from 26.5p to 27.2p, while for electricity the unit price is rising from 19p to 29.2p per kWh and the standing charge from 24p to 37.9p. Their annual gas bill will more than double, and the total annual energy bill is estimated to make a huge jump from £1,081.18 to £1,945.24. The changes are in line with other customers, who on top of rising unit prices have experienced large increases in electricity standing charges, caused in part by the failure of small suppliers last year. Margaret has a smart meter and has already seen the impact of the increase in her energy costs. “It used to be about £2.50 a day; it’s now going up to £7.50. I’ve thought about turning off the heating, turning off the radiator, maybe cooking one big pot of something a week and then eating it over several days.” Jess has been making similar calculations. “I’ve never thought about what we’re having for dinner in terms of energy before, but the other day I decided not to roast potatoes as that would mean having the oven on for an hour when doing mashed meant having the hob on for 10 minutes.” There are other things that have started to bite since the Guardian last spoke to the Dalys. Jess has recently returned to work and, because Robin has started at nursery, plans to drive to campus so she can get back quickly if she needs to. Parking on campus had been free during the pandemic, but costs have been reintroduced. They are an extra demand on the family’s budget. “Stuff like that is getting rolled back on now,” says Jess. They also have two days a week of childcare to pay for, although they are using the tax allowance from the government, which gets them an extra two days a month for their money. The family shop in Morrisons, and say they have found prices there to be lower than at some of its rivals. Margaret says she has been considering doing some of her shopping at Lidl.
