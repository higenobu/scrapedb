4/20/2022,"MBS suggested cozying up to Russia and China to punish Biden for sidelining him, The WSJ reported. As president, Biden has slammed Saudi Arabia's rights record and is yet to meet MBS in person. MBS and King Salman met last year to discuss how to get back at Biden for the slights, The WSJ said. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman threatened to move the country closer to Russia and China to punish President Joe Biden for distancing himself from the kingdom, The Wall Street Journal reported. Since coming to power, the Biden administration has criticized Saudi human rights abuses, reeled in US support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, and shunned Crown Prince Mohammed — colloquially known as MBS — with Biden yet to meet him in person. In February 2021, the US sanctioned dozens of Saudis believed to have played a role in the 2018 murder of Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi. The crown prince wasn't directly affected by the sanctions. In response, The Journal reported, citing Saudi officials, that MBS, his advisers, and his aging father, King Salman, met last year at a seaside palace to discuss what further punishments Biden may have in store and how the kingdom could get ahead of them. The group discussed releasing more political prisoners to appease Biden, The Journal reported, but Crown Prince Mohammed instead said Saudi Arabia should threaten to solidify alliances with Russia and China. Saudi Arabia released its most high profile political detainee, right-t0-drive activist Loujain al-Hathlou in February 2021. Several others were released in her wake. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider. It is unclear if the Crown Prince Mohammed actually threatened the US with a move toward China and Russia, but it is clear that Saudi Arabia has grown closer to China since last year, deepening ties in the military, cultural, and economic sectors. In that time, the Saudi-US relationship has continued to worsen, with the Saudis upset that the US is failing to guarantee its security in the face of strikes on the Arabian Peninsula by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia has also failed to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and has sought to avoid upsetting Russia by ignoring US requests for it to increase oil output to make up for the White House's ban on Russian oil imports. Crown Prince Mohammed reportedly ignored Biden's phone calls as the US tried to woo the Saudis for more oil.

4/20/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Russian defence ministry has proposed that relatives of soldiers killed in Ukraine should have to apply to military rather than civilian authorities for compensation payments, imposing an extra level of secrecy around its war losses. Russia already classifies military deaths as state secrets even in times of peace and has not updated its official casualty figures in Ukraine for nearly four weeks. In its proposal, the defence ministry asked that the benefits paid to the families of fallen soldiers no longer be overseen by civilian officials but handled by enlistment offices instead. That move is designed to ""limit the circle of people"" with information on Russian troops killed in Ukraine, it said. The proposal appeared on a government legal information website. It was unclear when it would be reviewed by the government. The ministry said on March 25 that 1,351 Russian soldiers had been killed and 3,825 wounded since Moscow launched what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine on Feb. 24. It has provided no update on military casualties since then, but the Kremlin has spoken of ""significant losses"". Ukraine and Western governments have said they believe Russian casualties are many times higher.

4/20/2022,"Alexei Navalny said Russian troops killed a man who shared his last name in Bucha last month. The jailed Putin critic said he was unsure whether the deceased Ukrainian was a relative. The head of a village near Bucha told BBC Ukraine the man was a distant relative of Navalny. The jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said Russian troops killed a Ukrainian man because he had the same last name as the Putin critic. In a Tuesday Twitter thread, Navalny shared a picture of a passport with the name Ilya Ivanovich Navalny that he said was left next to the body of a 60-year-old man in the town of Bucha. ""A passport with the surname 'Navalny' lies next to the dead body on the ground. This is one of the people killed in the Ukrainian village of Bucha. Ilya Ivanovich Navalny,"" the Russian opposition leader tweeted. ""Everything indicates that they killed him because of his last name. That's why his passport was defiantly thrown nearby,"" he said. Bucha, which is located outside the capital of Kyiv, was under Russian occupation for several weeks before being liberated last month. After Ukraine retook control of the town, authorities found the bodies of hundreds of civilians who appeared to be killed in gruesome fashion. —Alexey Navalny (@navalny) April 19, 2022 Insider could not independently verify Navalny's claims of Ilya Navalny's death. But the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag reported on Sunday that neighbors saw Ilya moments before they say he was shot by Russian soldiers on March 12. One woman, identified as Maria, told Bild am Sonntag: ""We entered our block of flats the moment Ilya came down the stairs. I said to him: 'Don't go out, there's shooting going on.' But he still wanted to go outside to smoke a cigarette. Then I kept hearing shots."" Maria said she later saw him dead on the floor, adding: ""They shot him in the head. His passport with the name Navalny was right next to him."" Navalny said he did not know if the man was a relative but that he came from the same village as his father. Navalny's father is from the Ukrainian village of Nove Zalissia, which is located 15 miles from Bucha, the BBC reported. Since his tweets, Pavlo Navalny, the head of Nove Zalissia, told BBC News Ukraine that Ilya was a distant relative of the Russian opposition leader. ""Yes, Ilya was a distant relative of Oleksy, he has a common great-grandfather,"" Pavlo Navalny said, using the Ukrainian spelling of the name Alexei. Pavlo told BBC Ukraine that he was himself a second cousin of the Russian opposition leader. Insider was not able to independently verify these claims. Navalny was poisoned with Novichok in Siberia in 2020, after which he flew to Germany for medical treatment. He was arrested and detained after returning to Russia last year. He was sentenced in March 2021 for missing parole hearings while he was recovering from the poisoning, and found guilty in a Russian court of fraud and contempt of court in March 2022. From prison, Navalny has continued to call on Russians to protest Putin's rule and the war in Ukraine via social media. He has been able to do so with the help of his lawyers and allies.
