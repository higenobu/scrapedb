2/12/2022,"The Russian coach of the brilliant 15-year-old skater at the eye of a doping storm in Beijing has broken her silence to insist that Kamila Valieva is “clean and innocent”.Eteri Tutberidze admitted that the situation surrounding her skater was “very controversial and difficult”, with the Court of Arbitration for Sport expected to rule within 24 hours whether Valieva can compete in the individual event on Tuesday after she tested positive for a banned heart drug.However Tutberidze told Russian state television that whatever Cas’s ruling, she believed that Valieva had done nothing wrong. “I want to say that I am absolutely sure that Camila is innocent and clean. For us, this is not a theorem, but an axiom, it does not need to be proved. We are with our athletes, in trouble and in joy, to the end.”  Valieva, who captured the hearts of the world when she became the first female skater to perform a quad at the Games as the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) won a brilliant team gold on Monday, has been allowed to train while she appeals her provisional suspension. She looked calm and focused at practice, producing a flawless rendition of her short programme to the music of ‘In Memoriam’ by Krill Richter. Coming off the ice, Sia’s ‘I’m Unstoppable’ blasted through the arena.A spokeswoman for the Figure Skating Federation of Russia told state-owned news agency RIA that Cas expected by 4pm UK time. Meanwhile over the last 24 hours attention in Russia has begun to focus on Tutberidze, who is known for her uncompromising methods. After Valieva’s positive test for trimetazidine, a drug usually used to treat angina, the hashtag #позорТутберидзе - “shame on you, Tutberidze” - has been trending on Twitter. However Valieva made a point of hugging her coach during practice on Saturday before walking through the mixed zone, accompanied by two burly minders. There was even a smile when she received shouts of encouragement from the Russian media.Speaking to Russian station Channel One, Tutberidze raised questions as to why it had taken so long for Valieva’s positive test to emerge, given it was conducted on Christmas Day but only reported by a Swedish laboratory on February 8. It has since emerged that the delay was caused by an outbreak of Covid at the lab in January. However Tutberidze didn’t sound convinced.“It is very unclear why an athlete with a dubious doping test on December 25 was admitted to the Olympic Games,” she said. “Either this is a fatal coincidence, or this is a very competent plan. I really hope that our leaders will not abandon us, defend our rights and prove our innocence.”Tutberidze, who has previously coached former Olympic gold medallists Yulia Lipnitskaya and Alina Zagitova, added: “I don’t know who and what decides, but I hope that justice will somehow prevail,” she added.Earlier the International Olympic Committee said it would welcome an anti-doping investigation into Valieva’s “entourage” after the 15-year-old Russian’s positive drugs test. “Entourage has been overlooked in the past,” IOC spokesman Mark Adams told a news conference on Saturday. “The IOC, as ever, would welcome investigation into the entourage in all cases where it’s relevant. In this case, as in all cases, we would welcome a strong line from the World Anti-Doping Agency on that.”That view was supported by double Olympic figure skating champion Katarina Witt, who insisted that Valieva was not responsible for her positive drugs test. Writing on her Facebook page Witt hailed Valieva as a “young girl and wonder child, who is just enchanting the whole world with her sportsmanship and grace, but she is not to blame here.”“This scandal is a dramatic cut to her young and promising career and I sincerely hope that enough people are by her side and protect her so that she doesn’t break,” she added.“Kamila has learned her quadruple jumps with infinite diligence and courage. No doping would have helped her to land these! And especially not with their artistic radiation! If anything, the adults responsible should be locked up for sports forever!” Meanwhile Dick Pound, a long-standing member of the IOC, questioned whether it was time for Russia to take an Olympic ‘timeout’. “At a certain point if they are absolutely incorrigible you end up with the position of take a country timeout,” said Pound. “We could say we can help you. You got a problem. We can concentrate on it. Take a time out for one or two, or three Olympic Games until you get this under control.”  ",Sport/Sport,‘Clean and innocent’: Valieva’s coach breaks her silence on doping scandal,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/12/clean-and-innocent-valievas-coach-breaks-her-silence-on-doping-scandal

2/12/2022,"Go into a park, find a tree you like, hold the tree and complain to the tree. This was Marina Abramović’s technique for staying focused during the pandemic. In 2020, she and a group of volunteers tried out this tree-hugging exercise during a five-hour programme on Sky Arts that sought to educate watchers on the history of performance art. Though at times it felt like watching a mockumentary, it was a transformative experience for the participants, according to Abramović. “It was amazing how people got emotional. How much they kept inside, and how talking to the tree [was] a kind of release.” It’s 11am in New York, where Abramović is based, and she has just finished a morning yoga session. She stretches out her arms, showing me her black fitness top before turning the web camera round to reveal a snowy landscape. “I like to do physical exercise. Walk in the snow. I don’t want to have my life in control. I hate [the] studio. I never go to the studio,” says the 75-year-old artist. “I like to put myself in very uncommon situations.”  Internationally known for her performance art pieces that experiment with time, metaphysics and the human body, Abramović is teaching her fans the art of endurance, concentration, self-control and willpower through a new series of instructions intended to “reboot your life”. The Marina Abramović Method is a set of 30 cards, each featuring a different DIY task. Some instructions are overtly unconventional, such as “Walk backwards with a mirror”, which she advises you to do outdoors. Others are secretly tricky, like “Open and close a door”, which seems simple until you read the small print telling you to do this continuously for one to three hours. Many are tethered to Abramović’s previous works. One card reads “Count each grain of rice and lentil”, which takes inspiration from her 2014 work Counting the Rice in which participants laboriously tallied up a pile of grains, one by one. Abramović, who was born in Belgrade in 1946, has been teaching the art of endurance since the 1980s and exploring it in her own artworks for far longer. She passes on her wisdom via her Cleaning the House five-day workshops, in which she takes a group of students to places that are too hot, or too cold, and never comfortable. “Nobody would eat anything apart from water and herbal tea. Without any talking and doing very hard physical and mental exercises, they will then make a work of art out of this.” Still, for all the stoicism, the Marina Abramović Method is not to be taken too seriously. There is an element of fun that she is leaning into thanks to the Dalai Lama, whom she first met in the early 80s. “I always remember what [he] said to me. You have to always start with playfulness. With a joke. Make people laugh to open their heart, and then you tell them terrible truths after, because they’re ready,” she says. “These cards are playful, but at the same time, if you really do [them] properly, you actually get a very deep experience. You enter two different states of consciousness. It’s all about how much we invest in time.” Why has she decided to distil her art-making practice for the general public now? There have been many pioneering figures – such as Carolee Schneemann, Ana Mendieta and Chris Burden – at the helm of performance art, but Abramović is undoubtably the face of the form. Her endurance art, despite its intensity, often veers into trendy themes such as mindfulness, and this has ensured her work’s absorption into pop culture. (Shia LaBeouf and Jay-Z both did their own versions) Such success hasn’t come without criticism: her work has been called kitsch, and “celebrity art at its most empty”. Are these cards just an exercise in self-branding; an artist making merchandise in order to capitalise on their fame? “I don’t think I will be rich by selling these cards,” she laughs. “I am such an interesting example of the art market. I have so many viewers and such a very large young audience, and still, my prices are much below the middle-career artists who make paintings,” she claims. Her only goal, she adds, is to engage people, especially young people. These methods for getting the most out of work and life aren’t your typical self-help tips, but they are in line with an artist whose oeuvre consists of pushing herself to the limit. One of her earliest works was her six-hour performance at Galleria Studio Morra in Naples, where Abramović allowed the public to interact with her body in any way they chose, using a range of 72 objects (scissors, bread, a gun) that were laid out on a table. “I was a painter before, but the first time [I performed] in front of an audience, I felt the electricity that I never felt in my studio. At my age right now, I am not able to do any more of that kind of long durational performance. I did The Artist Is Present [in which she sat at a table for eight hours a day, allowing visitors to sit silently opposite her] when I was 65. This was hell on earth to do! Now I’m 75, I’m thinking about how I can express those thoughts [in] different mediums. I just made the opera,” she says, referring to 7 Deaths of Maria Callas, a piece about the tragic myths surrounding the Greek-American soprano. Age aside, works such as The Artist Is Present, and 512 Hours, where she and gallery visitors walked around in silence, require audience participation and close contact, and that seems inconceivable in these times. The pandemic has irrevocably changed the boundaries that artists can push. “Contact with the public is absolutely essential. Because if a performer doesn’t have the public, the performance is nonexistent.” Abramović doesn’t hate technology – her 2018 work Rising uses VR technology to explore rising sea levels, and she collaborated with tech company WeTransfer in 2021 to create an immersive digital experience titled Traces – but she thinks our approach to it is all wrong. “Everything became Zoom. I absolutely don’t like working with Zoom. First, the sound is bad. Images are terrible. I always think, just have patience and wait, because this isn’t going to last for ever. We are talking about two years. It’s nothing.” Abramović’s first UK retrospective, delayed by the pandemic, is due to be held at the Royal Academy in 2023. Spanning her 50-year career, the show will recreate her live performance pieces, adapted to reflect a change in her physicality, and feature new works. “They decided to postpone it for three years. This is kind of big,” she says. “I’m 75. Time goes. I really need to do this show earlier rather than later. But at the same time, I understood that it would be a disaster if I had it in 2020, because I depend on the public.” It isn’t long before she brings up NFTs (non-fungible tokens: those much-discussed artworks that are also a unique unit of digital data stored on blockchains). “I don’t like to be some old-fashioned artist who criticises everything new,” she says. “I love everything that is new. I’m curious. But with this medium, I didn’t see any good ideas. I didn’t see great content. I only see everybody talking about how much money you can make. I never made art for money,” she says. “I’ve been asked every day to do some. They say: ‘Your work is perfect for NFTs. Why are you not doing something?’ Somebody requested if I could sell my soul as an NFT.” Abramović may not be ready to sell her soul, but she has other ways of exploring immortality. She has created the world’s first mixed-reality performance artwork, titled The Life, which uses 36 video cameras to create a simulation of her body. “This is the closest to immortality that I can get. This piece doesn’t have as much value now because I’m alive, but the moment I’m not there … I can appear in your living room, I can walk in your garden. That is something that is mind-blowing.” Abramović is clearly intent on injecting herself into the future, but how will the future feel about her? Considering how people long dead are now being held accountable for their past behaviour, what about those comments she made in her 1979 diary about Indigenous Australians? In remarks initially republished in her 2016 memoir Walk Through Walls (but later taken out), she had said that they looked “terrible”, “like dinosaurs” and are really “strange and different”. As the passage became shared and criticised, Abramović released a statement saying that she had “the greatest respect for Aborigine people” and that her earlier description “does not represent the understanding and appreciation of Aborigines that I subsequently acquired through immersion in their world and carry in my heart today”. Abramović has spent time with Indigenous people in Australia and the Siberian desert, and has taken part in retreats with Tibetan monks. Her tree-hugging exercise was inspired by time spent with Amazonian tribes, where they would, according to her, dance with the sequoia tree. “This dance with the tree was so incredibly moving and emotional, so I said: ‘Wow, why don’t I create exercise that really works for me?’” Given that her performance artworks and career have long drawn on the sacred practices picked up on her visits to Indigenous communities, I inquire about the methods she has undertaken to battle racism personally in recent years, with more attention on Black lives and indigenous people. Instead, Abramović responds by taking issue with how her words were reported in the first place. “People take out the quote and they don’t actually see the context,” she says. “I said that Aboriginal [people are] the oldest race on the planet. They are like dinosaurs. Next to that sentence. I also say they have to be treated like living treasures. They only saw my quote about dinosaurs.” She appears to have forgotten her own words – there’s a semantic difference between “they look like dinosaurs” and “they are like dinosaurs” – though either way, likening people to animals feels like textbook dehumanisation. “This is so sad,” says Abramović, before somewhat arbitrarily bringing up her longstanding collaborations with transgender people (“much longer than [people have been] talking about”), as well as her work about the Yugoslav wars, and mentioning the Dalai Lama once more. “The only way to stop violence is to learn to forgive and we are not able to forgive as human beings. We are repeating this over and over. This is not new. This is a centuries[-old] story.” Abramović believes the online criticism directed at her is due to the press manipulating people and that sexism, ultimately, is at fault: “The press is so much tougher on women than on men.” She told me earlier in the conversation that she has never used Instagram and doesn’t go online except for emails and meetings. “There’s so many people who think that what I’m doing is not art at all. If I read this, I will never even leave home.” She might not read everything, but she reads some things. She asks me who will write the headline for this interview after being outraged with the Times for an article it published last year. “The title, to me, was incredibly vulgar. I was so angry. It was ‘Marina Abramović, young lover, dirty jokes, and magic crystals’. They will not do this to male artists,” she says. “They used a photograph of me for the interview that I did not approve. I don’t know where they found it. Why don’t you put in pictures of the work?!” One of The Method’s instruction cards reads “Notice a moment of anger, then stop it”. It advises you to hold your breath until you reach your physical limit and repeat as needed, until the anger subsides. It comes to mind as Abramović discusses her treatment by the media. “I need to go, my dear,” she says abruptly. She does appear calmer for having said her piece. “It was lovely talking to you.” The Marina Abramović Method: Instruction Cards to Reboot Your Life is published by Laurence King (£16.99) on 17 February.",Arts/Art and design,Marina Abramović: ‘I don’t want to have my life in control’,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/12/marina-abramovic-i-dont-want-to-have-my-life-in-control
2/12/2022,"Play clean. The Rams have the talent advantage. Their defense ranks first in the league in pressure rate, and gets almost all of that with a four-man rush. Putting that up against this flaky Bengals offensive line? Yikes. Favorites lose Super Bowls by way of bone-headed plays, dodgy time management, or unforced turnovers – typically a cocktail of all three. If the Rams can keep the turnover battle even, they have the defense to take over the game. OC  Jalen Ramsey is one of the few cornerbacks fierce enough to go toe-to-toe with Ja’Marr Chase. The rest of the Rams’ secondary has been less than inspiring. But Darious Williams and company must contain Joe Burrow’s other weapons. Tee Higgins, who would be the top wideout on most other teams, torched the Chiefs in the AFC Championship. MJ Duh. Attack Burrow. He has dragged his team to the league’s final game despite being sacked 12 times in these playoffs, including nine times in the divisional round against the top-seeded Titans. And while Tennessee boast a fine group of pass rushers, they ain’t got nuthin’ on Aaron Donald, unquestionably the best all-around defensive player of the era; and Von Miller, a speedy, bendy, quarterback crusher. AL It’s the duty of this vaunted Rams defense to make Penei Sewell trend on Sunday. If the Rams prevent Burrow from getting the ball off in time, there will be an entire offseason for the Bengals to second-guess themselves for drafting Chase over the offensive tackle. HF Keep their eyes off the scoreboard and their foot on the accelerator. Sean McVay needs to stick to his offensive script so Matthew Stafford can use his football intelligence to carve up the Bengals with killer throws. GS Hit explosive plays on offense. The Rams’ secondary and linebacking corps is shaky in coverage, and that’s where Cincy will look to attack. If Burrow and Co can outpace the Rams in the explosive plays category, while the defense forces the Rams to sustain long, droning drives, they’ll have a shot. OC Hello, Captain Obvious here … the Bengals must stop Donald, the best player in the NFL. No big deal, right? Cincy’s offensive line continues to be their weak link and the Rams (starring Donald) will be the unit’s toughest test yet. MJ So far Chase has yet to show there is a corner who can consistently mark him. And even though Ramsey is one of the best, he will have his hands full if the Bengals move Chase around their formations. And if the Cincinnati line gives Burrow time to find him. AL Don’t fall behind early. In the AFC championship game, the Bengals held the Kansas City Chiefs to a single field-goal after halftime. That was impressive. They were also down 21-3 in the second quarter. That’s not a repeatable strategy. HF Stuff the run. Cincinnati’s defense is unfairly maligned: they kept the Chiefs in check better than the Bills, after all. San Francisco stopped LA rushing in the NFC Championship and it almost worked. If the Bengals do stifle Sony Michel and Cam Akers that opens up extra coverage from linebackers to help slow down Cooper Kupp and Odell Beckham Jr. GS Jalen Ramsey, cornerback. The big question for the Rams is how they will deploy their star cornerback. It would make sense for LA to double the Bengals’ best receiver, Chase, on the outside and then use Ramsey to take away Burrow’s second option inside. OC Matthew Stafford, quarterback. After toiling in the football hell otherwise known as Detroit, Stafford was rescued by McVay. He’s clearly an upgrade over Jared Goff but he’s also not a sure thing. He must play clean football, especially given the tiny window the Rams have to hoist the Lombardi Trophy. MJ Odell Beckham Jr, wide receiver. He’s been an offensive X-factor all postseason. At the Super Bowl now, he has a chance to deliver his biggest career highlight since his NFT-worthy one-handed catch on Sunday Night Football in 2014. AL Jalen Ramsey, cornerback. Ramsey has the talent to go one-and-one with Chase, freeing up the rest of the defense to sniff out other offensive threats. HF Aaron Donald, defensive tackle. Donald will be aiming to destroy the Bengals’ offensive line but Cincinnati will hopefully, for their sake, be planning how they can mitigate his power. GS Tyler Boyd, wide receiver. So often in the Super Bowl, it comes down to a team’s third receiver. The defense doubles one of the top two guys and finds creative schematic quirks to isolate the other. Chase and Higgins will dominate the attention of the Rams D, and so it will fall on Boyd to be the chain-mover and post-catch creator who helps Burrow to move the ball into scoring range. OC Jessie Bates, safety. Bates is the best-known member of Cincy’s “no-name” defense for a reason. He’s the one player on the Bengals defense who could force McVay into earlier-than-anticipated adjustments. MJ CJ Uzomah, tight end. While Bengals coach Zac Taylor still has Uzomah as a 50-50 prospect for Sunday, his limited participation in Bengals practices this week is an encouraging sign. Uzomah not only gives Burrow another target to play off of Chase and Higgins, he can chip in on pass protection too. AL Evan McPherson, kicker. It’s tempting to go with Burrow, or Chase, but what about the most clutch kicker in the league? If these playoffs are any indication, everything could come down to a single field goal. There’s nobody I’d trust more in that situation than McPherson. HF Joe Burrow, quarterback. He never flinches when under pressure while often creating a more explosive play when the defense shuts down the official script. The Rams’ defensive front can be as punishing as they like, Burrow enjoys his medicine. GS A special team’s snafu leads to a score. This year’s postseason has been dominated by special teams mishaps. Both the Rams and Bengals are nestled comfortably in the top-eight of special teams units, but the Football Gods care not for such trivial things when there’s a good ol’ narrative on the line. OC One of the main five performers in the halftime show – Kendrick Lamar, Dr Dre, Mary J Blige, Eminem, and Snoop Dogg – will be a no show after their limo gets stuck in LA’s insufferable traffic. MJ Taylor’s gonna draw up something crazy. And given Cincinnati’s woebegone history, it feels like it will take a little crazy to beat the Rams in their backyard. AL Our Discourse-poisoned era feels like the perfect scenario for the game to be completely overshadowed by something unrelated to football. Maybe Dr Dre’s halftime show ends up going disastrously wrong or there’s a Super Bowl ad that is so ill-conceived that the on-field action turns into a subplot. HF Joe Mixon rides to the Bengals’ rescue with a Super Bowl and MVP winning performance. Quick passes galore to the back keep the chains moving as Mixon leads Cincinnati in receiving yards and racks up 150+ yards from scrimmage. GS Rams 24-27 Bengals. This is tricky. The Rams can score points in chunks and have the kind of defense that could elevate any side to a championship. On the other hand, there is Joe Burrow’s coat. There are the cigars. There’s the chain. There’s McPherson’s icy veins. There’s something about this Bengals team that makes you want to ditch any sense of intelligent analysis in favor of picking what’s fun. OC Rams 35-22 Bengals. I can’t get over the mismatch that is the Rams’ elite defensive front against the Bengals’ below average offensive line. The Rams also have a huge advantage playing in their hometown. No, not because they have a robust fanbase. But because they have spent the week in their facilities, sticking to their routines. The Bengals, on the other hand, are sleeping in a hotel and dealing with the insane logistics that come with the Super Bowl. MJ Rams 34-28 Bengals. Despite the Bengals’ team-of-destiny vibes, few teams make it to the top without taking some lumps in the beginning. (The legacy of lumps don’t apply.) Meanwhile, the Rams have a prime chance to take their city back – and if they flop a second time, there’s no telling if they’ll have another. GM Les Snead mortgaged the team’s future to win right now. If their stars align, I just don’t see how they miss this moment. AL Rams 24-30 Bengals (OT). The Rams lose without touching the ball in overtime, something which finally forces the NFL to change its silly rules. Everyone wins (except, obviously, the Rams). HF Rams 21-24 Bengals. The pressure is on but who will blink first? The Bengals have been excellent in the clutch and that will shade the Rams’ flashy roster. McVay’s failure from three years ago could also negatively influence his decisions. Burrow grinds against the odds to set McPherson up and McFearless drills the game-winner home. Who dey think gonna beat them Bengals? Nobody … finally!

2/12/2022,"Sheila Heti hadn’t intended to write a book about grief, but in late 2018, about a year after she’d started writing her new novel, Pure Colour, her father died. “He had been sick, but it was always going to be a shock. It has been the most profound change I’ve experienced in adulthood, having a parent die. Mother and father are connected to what life is, and you know all along they aren’t the sky, the earth – they’re people. But while your mind knows it, maybe your body doesn’t,” she says. As a result of the shock, she adds, the story in her book “suddenly breaks”. Heti and I are sitting in her cosy second-floor apartment in Toronto, which she shares with her boyfriend of 11 years, Luc, and their friendly rottweiler, Feldman. Outside, a blizzard blows, but Feldman keeps us both warm by snoozing on our feet. A mutual friend had told me beforehand that the 45-year-old Heti “will seem young to you”, and, with her girlish voice and 1990s teenager outfit of a long-sleeved T-shirt beneath a cotton blue dress, she does at first. But she seems older than I expected, too. Her short, pixie-like fringe, which she had when she wrote her previous bestselling novels, 2010’s How Should a Person Be? and 2018’s Motherhood, has gone (“I just grew out of it”), and she has a quietness and perceptiveness that is often overlooked by critics, who mistake her originality for kookiness. It is easy to imagine her, simultaneously, as the precociously artsy girl she once was and the pin‑sharp older woman she will one day be.  Pure Colour exemplifies both that originality and sharpness. It encompasses the beginning and end of the world, and Adam and Eve, as well as her character Mira’s entire life, all within a slim 200 and some pages; it’s the kind of book that you start reading again as soon as you finish it, to see how on earth the author pulled it off. “With my other books, I thought as I was writing: ‘OK, this friend is going to read this and I want the book to tell this to them.’ But with this book there was no thought of that. I just felt completely cut off and it became more intuitive,” Heti says. As a result, the novel has a dreaminess to it, and some sections read as though they come straight from Heti’s subconscious, such as when Mira’s grief for her father so overwhelms her that she becomes, for quite an extended time, a leaf. “That was how [grief] felt for me – not so much being out of my body, but just feeling very far from everyone and not part of the active world,” Heti reflects. As a teenager growing up in Toronto, the daughter of Hungarian Jewish immigrants, Heti loved books by writers such as Henry Miller, Edmund White and the Marquis de Sade. They gave her a sense of the novel as a medium without a template: she could do anything that she wanted with it. In the very funny and tender How Should a Person Be?, a late-twentysomething called Sheila mooches around Toronto and New York and talks with her friends – sometimes in prose, sometimes in script format – as she tries to answer the eponymous question. In the more interior and occasionally feverish Motherhood, a late-thirtysomething, also called Sheila, mooches around Toronto, talks with her friends and boyfriend, Miles, and tries to figure out if she wants to have a baby. The novels might sound similar, but they are completely different in tone and mood, with the earlier work capturing the self-awareness and self-doubt of one’s 20s, and the latter mining the panic and anxiety that besets a certain kind of thirtysomething. Because they feature so much autobiography, many critics described them as autofiction, akin to Karl Ove Knausgård and Rachel Cusk. Heti used to wince at the word, but now accepts that “it’s a useful term because it helps people’s expectations of the book. I just call it fiction, though. All writers use their lives. Look at Proust – it’s all fucking autofiction,” she says. Her repeated use of autobiography means that Heti’s books illuminate one another: in Motherhood, she writes that her mother’s criticism of her as a child made her “desperate to live as a person beyond criticism; to prove that I was better than any of the ways she saw me”, which casts a new light on the title of her first novel. Motherhood focuses primarily on her complicated relationship with her mother, while her father, the playful caregiver, is glimpsed only in the shadows. Now, in Pure Colour, she brings him into the light. Unlike the previous two books, Pure Colour is written in the third person, and it is not asking a central question: the narrator is entirely certain what she’s talking about, telling the reader from the start why people are how they are, and why the world is as it is. This is partly a reflection of Heti herself – “Yes, I do feel more certain in myself now,” she agrees – and also because this is a novel about middle age, that point in life when “the party is happening behind a closed door”, as the book puts it, when there aren’t so many questions to be asked, just things to deal with. Initially, pure colour feels wistful and lightly satirical, with the narrator explaining that we are all living in God’s “first draft of existence”. Mira marvels at the passing of time since her youth, before the internet and social media, and what she describes as “the friendship revolution, which made being in touch of primary importance”. But then, suddenly, Mira’s father dies, and the story becomes something Heti was not expecting. “I didn’t think the experience [of my father dying] would be part of the book, but then I thought, ‘Oh, first draft of existence …’ It feels like you’re in the second draft, after the death of a parent, because it is like the world has ended, right? I saw how all of those things came together,” she says. No writer likes to be told their novel is reminiscent of someone else’s, so it is with some trepidation that I tell her at times Pure Colour made me think of Patricia Lockwood’s No One Is Talking About This, which was shortlisted for the Booker prize last year, and which also combines grief with jokey observations about how technology has changed the world. She nods. “Yes, Patricia and I are friends, and a few years ago we were telling each other about our books, and I said, ‘These books have a lot in common!’ So we exchanged manuscripts and, structurally, they feel very similar,” she says. For me, Heti’s is the stronger book, with descriptions of grief that are so surprising and true they made me gasp: “She had thought that, when someone died, it would be like they went into a different room,” she writes. “She had not known that life itself transformed into a different room, and trapped you in it without them.” In her previous books, Heti has written with similar honesty about love and sex. Does it ever feel exposing to write about such personal experiences? “I never feel exposed because there’s nothing inside me that isn’t in you. All writing is about all of us, so it doesn’t feel like I’m saying anything that isn’t just about the human experience,” she says. Yet choosing not to have a child simply because you don’t want one, as Sheila decides in Motherhood, is not a universal experience. That book sparked reams of commentary, either celebrating or questioning Heti’s reasoning. I contribute further to it by telling her the one part of the book that frustrated me was Sheila’s belief that she had to make a choice between pursuing her art and having a baby. Why couldn’t her partner look after the baby while she got on with her art? “Do you have children?” she asks, establishing the lay of the land here. I tell her I do. “I know lots of artists who have children, so that’s not the reason why I didn’t have them, because I thought I couldn’t make art,” she says. The reason she didn’t have children, Heti says, is because she didn’t want to, and that’s all that needs saying. “But you have to have reasons,” she adds wryly. Has she ever regretted making that decision so publicly, given she will be asked about it for the rest of her life? She thinks about that for a moment. “No, because I like that book,” she says, and laughs. As a child, Heti loved to act and write, putting on shows with her friends and writing stories with her father. She eventually decided that she had to choose between the two to better her chances at becoming good at something. She made her name writing for the literary journal the Believer, but left that to work on a collaborative book, Women in Clothes, which she has described as “a conversation among hundreds of women” about their fashion choices. As well as that and her novels, she has written a play, a novella, a collection of stories, two children’s books and another collaborative publication, this one about philosophy. She loves books “above all”, she says, and we are surrounded by shelves stuffed with the classics – Gide, Flaubert, Tolstoy. Heti peppers her conversation with book recommendations: Adelle Waldman’s 2013 debut, The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P; Acts of Service by Lillian Fishman, another debut which will be published in the UK this summer; and the recent autobiographical novel Fuccboi by Sean Thor Conroe, about a secretly very un-woke young man who is shagging around and trying to get his book published. “There are so many good writers!” she says happily, and the inspiration she takes from them is that “they do their own thing so well, so you need to figure out what your thing is”. One recent discovery is The Wall by Marlen Haushofer, an Austrian dystopian novel originally published in 1963. “It’s out of print at the moment and it makes you sick, because, if she wasn’t a woman, everyone would be reading it, like Robinson Crusoe,” Heti says. Does she think books by women still get treated differently from those by men? “Totally. It’s been really interesting reading the reviews for Fuccboi and comparing them to my reviews for Motherhood. Critics give him the benefit of the doubt, assume he knows what he’s doing, that he’s made conscious choices. No one’s saying, ‘[The character] is the author.’ But with Motherhood, critics were very critical of the character as a person, which surprised me.” By now, the blizzard has become a full snow storm and there are no taxis to be found. I say I’ll leave her be and go for a walk, but Heti insists I stay, and so we sit and chat about our lives for a further 45 minutes. Luc comes home and the two of them talk to one another with the kind of flirtatious frisson you rarely see in couples who have been together for more than a decade. I ask her if he’s Miles from Motherhood, and she hesitates. “He’s who I was with when I wrote it, yes,” she says, carefully delineating between her life and her books. We talk more about Motherhood and she asks if I ever regret having children. I say no, because I’d have been bereft without them. But of course, I say, looking around at her bookshelves, there are times when I miss my old life, when I could stay home alone all day and read and write in peace. “So your ideal self is to be a happily child-free woman,” she says. I agree, and I can see her filing that on an internal index card in her brain. Then she looks at me and grins. To buy a copy of Pure Colour for £14.78 go to guardianbookshop.com.

2/12/2022,"Liverpool need to keep on winning to have any hope of challenging Manchester City and with Diogo Jota picking up four goals in his last four in all competitions, while Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané return to the squad, they feel very well equipped to dispatch Burnley. Sean Dyche’s side, of course, are no pushovers, draws against Chelsea, West Ham, Wolves, Arsenal and Manchester United are proof of that but drab stalemates are not good enough. Now might not be the time to throw caution to the wind, and another creditable draw would be nice, but without wins Burnley will go down.

2/12/2022,"There is a danger that what had looked like being a season to remember for West Ham could turn sour. David Moyes’ side may still be fourth but results have stuttered a little. Then Kurt Zouma was shown abusing his cat on social media and was booed by his own supporters during the 1-0 win over Watford on Tuesday. Moyes is likely to select Zouma again, despite public outrage, for the visit of a Leicester side who have problems of their own having taken just one point from their past three games while being dumped out of the FA Cup by Nottingham Forest.

2/12/2022,"Tottenham seem to have misplaced their defensive solidity under Antonio Conte in the past few weeks. Having conceded four goals in the Italian’s first eight Premier League games in charge they have shipped eight in the past three, including Wednesday’s 3-2 home defeat to Southampton. The visit of Wolves is probably a welcome one, then, considering only Norwich and Burnley have scored fewer than their 19 this season. Conte could shake things up after back-to-back Premier League defeats by handing debuts to the January signings Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski, while Bruno Lage may be tempted to give Chiquinho a first start after he impressed as a substitute in Thursday’s 1-0 defeat by Arsenal.

2/12/2022,"British troops helping with training in Ukraine will be leaving the country this weekend, the armed forces minister has said. James Heappey said of theUK personnel sent to train Ukrainians on the anti-tank missiles supplied by Britain: “All of them will be withdrawn. There will be no British troops in Ukraine if there is to be a conflict there.”  He added to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “They will be leaving over the course of the weekend.” The Foreign Office issued guidance on Friday advising British citizens in Ukraine to leave while commercial means are still available, amid increasing concern of an invasion by Russia. The US warned on Friday of the “very distinct possibility” of a Russian invasion of Ukraine in the next few days and told all remaining Americans to leave the country in the next 48 hours. On Saturday, President Joe Biden will speak with Vladimir Putin by phone. Before the discussion, Australia and New Zealand became the latest countries to urge their citizens to leave Ukraine as soon as possible, joining Britain, Japan, Latvia, Norway and the Netherlands. Israel said it was evacuating relatives of embassy staff.",News/UK news,UK troops sent to help train Ukrainian army to leave country this weekend,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/12/uk-troops-sent-to-help-train-ukrainian-army-to-leave-country-this-weekend
