5/4/2022,"A New York court has rejected an attempt by Donald Trump to halt a contempt order and $10,000 in daily fines levied against the former US president for failing to properly comply with an investigation into his company. Trump was found in contempt of the court last month for failing to comply with a subpoena from Letitia James, the New York state attorney general, who is seeking financial records for her civil fraud investigation into the Trump Organization. The twice-impeached former president was hit with a $10,000 daily fine by the judge, Arthur Engoron, until he provided the documents sought by James. Trump claims the records cannot be found and attempted to have the fines and contempt order removed. Alina Habba, Trump’s lawyer, argued in her appeal that the “exorbitant fine is wholly unjustified” and the treatment of the property mogul and former host of TV show The Apprentice was “unconscionable and indefensible”. However, Engoron has turned down this appeal, leaving Trump with $80,000 in fines to date. The judge criticized an affidavit from Trump that outlined how the company has searched fruitlessly for the documents required by James. “Mr Trump’s personal affidavit is completely devoid of any useful detail,” Engoron wrote. James is investigating allegations that the Trump Organization committed fraud by manipulating the stated valuations of its properties in order to get more favorable terms for loans, insurance rates and taxes. The attorney general’s legal team claims the company “used fraudulent and misleading financial statements to obtain economic benefit”. In February, Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump, two of Trump’s children, were ordered to appear to give evidence in the case. They have appealed this order and are awaiting the outcome. Trump himself has called James an “operative of the Democrat party” and claims he is the victim of the “greatest witch-hunt of all time”. Trump has become embroiled in a number of legal problems since his presidential term ended last year, shortly after an attempt by his supporters to overthrow the result of the 2020 presidential election. On Tuesday, the Trump Organization and Trump’s presidential inaugural committee agreed to pay Washington DC, authorities $750,000 to settle a lawsuit that claimed they illegally misused funds from the non-profit committee to enrich the Trump family. And on Monday, a grand jury was formed in Atlanta as part of a criminal investigation into whether Trump improperly attempted to force Georgia officials to overturn the result of the election in that state. Joe Biden won Georgia on his way to triumphing in the 2020 election.",News/US news,"Court rejects Trump’s attempt to halt contempt order and $10,000 daily fine",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/04/donald-trump-contempt-order-daily-fine-new-york-court
5/4/2022,"Stephen Sondheim was so vast a talent that London on Tuesday night required two theatres to remember him, after his death in November aged 91. Produced by Cameron Mackintosh and staged by Maria Friedman – longtime collaborators who personify the title Old Friends, from a number in 1981’s Merrily We Roll Along – the show at the Sondheim (named in tribute in 2019) was simulcast on the Prince Edward stage, a version of technology developed for the NT Live theatre-cinema hybrid, though not usually used between venues 0.17 miles apart. Caused by ticket demand (proceeds to the Stephen Sondheim foundation), this arrangement bestowed immediacy in the eponymous auditorium but the overspill audience gained greater detail from closeups and cutaways. This was a glorious memorial service, each of the tunes a eulogy, every eulogist either a current star (Judi Dench, Bernadette Peters, Imelda Staunton, Clive Rowe) or a likely future one (the cast swelled by young actors and drama school students.) In anthology shows, as in sport, selection is central. Some of the 41 songs demanded inclusion. Friedman brings piping hot comedy and vocal clarity to Mrs Lovett’s lethal recipes, A Little Priest, from Sweeney Todd. Written for a woman in early middle age, Send in the Clowns, as reprised by Dench at 87, becomes hauntingly valedictory, lines such as “this late in my career” now echoing those in I’m Still Here, in which Petula Clark, two years Dench’s senior, confirmed Sondheim’s genius in writing songs that fit a show but a standalone performer can make their own. There are also surprises, such as Live Alone and Like It (written for the movie Dick Tracy), performed by Michael Ball, whose version of Could I Leave You?, a female heterosexual song from Follies, makes the character explicitly male and gay, thus, as the show often subtly does, acknowledging Sondheim’s life while respecting his art. Typical of astute curation is including the spoof Bossa Nova song The Boy from …, in which a young woman holidaying in Rio laments the romantic inaccessibility of a young man from a 62-word village in Brazil who later emigrates to a 58-word town in Wales, these athletically tongue-twisting locations sadistically repeated. Sondheim regarded this song, from an obscure off-Broadway revue, as an amusing curiosity. But Mackintosh popularised it through his 1976 anthology Side By Side By Sondheim, and it showcases the astonishing lyrical dexterity and, triumphing over its challenge to a singer’s breath control, Janie Dee threatened to raise both roofs. Generically, it’s a concert rather than a fully staged show, but with props and costumes it feels seriously rehearsed. Rob Brydon and Haydn Gwynne find sharply fresh line readings in The Little Things You Do Together, the marital battle from Company. Among flourishes of choreography (Matthew Bourne and Stephen Mear) is reshaping the usually solo Broadway Baby for a chorus line of 10 top musical women, led by Julia McKenzie, on stage for the first time since the 1990s. Next to me was a Yorkshire couple given tickets as a diamond jubilee wedding present. As that timescale suggests, they have seen a lot of theatre but said this was the best ever: “Could you give it 10 stars?” If rules allowed, I would. There will be obvious frustration at the two-off nature of this evening but it would be a surprise if a recording or streaming does not spread the remarkable magic.",Arts/Stage,Stephen Sondheim’s Old Friends review – a glorious all-star memorial service ,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/04/stephen-sondheims-old-friends-review-a-glorious-all-star-memorial-service
5/4/2022,"Russia is stepping up airstrikes on key Ukrainian supply lines delivering billions of pounds worth of western arms to the country, including on railway lines and warehousing. With Moscow and Kyiv-locked in a race to shape the conditions for the current phase of the war in Ukraine, the rapid and growing flow of weapons supplied by Ukraine’s western backers has become an increased focus for both sides. On Tuesday Russian airstrikes hit six train stations in central and western Ukraine as the Kremlin stepped up its targeting of key infrastructure, including electrical and water supply substations. A Russian cruise missile also hit a hangar in Odesa housing Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drones as well as missiles and ammunition from the United States and Europe, according to the Russian ministry of defence. As sources indicated that the UK intends to supply Kyiv with cargo drones to carry supplies on the battlefields in the east and south, the flow of western weapons heading for Ukraine was turning into a flood amid US fears of Russian plans to annex the separatist territories of Donetsk and Luhansk in the east, and the Kherson region in the south. The early focus of weapons supplies to Ukraine was initially small arms and defensive equipment but that has changed in recent weeks, not least after the announcement by the US president, Joe Biden, of a $33bn (£26bn) support package for Ukraine including $20bn in military aid. Speaking last month, Biden talked of the need for the increased supply of heavier weapons to Ukraine, describing it as a “critical window” as Russia shifted its focus to the east. The supply of weapons to Ukraine has been given a boost after the military experienced shortages and stockpiles of ammunition have dwindled. But it has also been driven by an increasingly vocal view among western leaders, including Biden and Boris Johnson, that the threat posed by Russia requires that it be “weakened”. The US has already rushed about $3.4bn worth of weapons to Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February, including anti-aircraft Stinger systems, Javelins, ammunition and body armour. Among the weapons systems being shipped to Ukraine by the US include C-4, howitzers, Mi-17 helicopters, armoured Humvees, M113 personnel carriers, Switchblade drones, and M18A1 Claymore anti-personnel mines with defence sources confirming that dozens of artillery pieces had arrived in country. US weapons that have already arrived in Ukraine include more than 5,500 Javelin anti-tank rocket systems, which are credited with the heavy toll on Russian armour. The latest arms shipments come on top of the Pentagon’s confirmation last month that Ukraine had received unspecified fighter airplanes and aircraft. The EU has earmarked €450m (£379m) for arms for Ukraine including air-defence systems, anti-tank weapons and ammunition. The UK is supplying Mastiff heavily armoured patrol vehicles, the cargo drones announced this week, and has supplied Ukraine with Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles, 800 anti-tank missiles, and precision munitions. The rapid increase in arms supplies comes as Russian forces have changed tactics since the first phase of the war, before Russian troops withdrew from their failed assault around Kyiv to focus operations on eastern and southern areas of Ukraine. Russian forces are now relying more heavily on the intensive use of artillery and rockets against largely outgunned Ukrainian defences, not least in the Donbas region. Ukraine has also received weapons from other sources, including Germany which – after initial hesitation – has become one of the biggest arms suppliers to Kyiv sending Gepard armoured anti-aircraft system. The Czech Republic has also sent T-72 battle tanks, while Canada announced last month it had delivered heavy artillery, including M777 howitzers. A Ukrainian military official described last week the increased focus of Russian strikes on infrastructure being aimed at disrupting Kyiv’s access to western weapons. “It is my opinion that they didn’t believe the west would give Ukraine the necessary heavy weapon supplies, so now the process has started they feel they need to do something about that. Because western weapons and Ukrainian combat experience combined give us a big advantage.” Speaking during a visit to a semiconductor factory that produces chips for the Javelin missile system on Tuesday, Biden justified his policy. “This fight is not going to be cheap, but caving to aggression would be even more costly,” he told workers. “You’re allowing the Ukrainians to defend themselves, and quite frankly, we’re making fools of the Russian military in many instance.”",News/World news,Russian airstrikes target western arms arriving in Ukraine ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/04/russian-airstrikes-target-western-arms-arriving-in-ukraine
5/4/2022,"A list of radical ideas for transforming the NHS, including lifting safeguards blocking startups’ access to patient data, and nurses being incentivised to help speed trials, was privately drawn up by drug and healthcare companies in talks with senior No 10 advisers. The proposals, which can be revealed after a freedom of information request, emerged in private roundtables convened by a taskforce appointed by Boris Johnson to generate ideas for cutting supposed red tape after Brexit. But campaigners for transparency and patient confidentiality expressed concern that the suggestions, which included criticism of what was described as “false protectors of patient interests”, could lower standards and weaken patient protections if implemented. The ideas emerged in a “pharma round table” attended by representatives of companies including GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, drug firm lobbyists and figures including Johnson’s chief health adviser, William Warr, and at another for digital health. Minutes show that ideas included:  The creation of a new category of what were described as “special forces nurses” to “reward’’ NHS staff who helped speed up testing and trials of new drugs in hospitals. The minutes state: “This would help the industry move away from the current culture/fear of scapegoating if anything goes wrong.”  Removing barriers preventing startup companies from accessing NHS data. Such firms have traditionally been excluded on account of the risks associated with them.  “Data trusts” – third parties independent of the NHS and industry – that would hold and allow startup companies access to NHS data, as a way of overcoming concerns about confidentiality and the use of private information.  A data equivalent of the organ donor scheme, which patients could opt in to, with the result that driving licences might read “data donor” as well as “organ donor”. The minutes described it as an “attractive idea” but added that a Tory MP and taskforce member, George Freeman, had previously championed this and could not find a form the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, was comfortable with.  Easing the level of inspection of innovative cell therapy – the introduction of healthy cells into a body to destroy diseased ones – required by the Human Tissue Authority. Critics have expressed concern about reducing regulation and oversight in a relatively new area where ethically sensitive issues have cropped up. The minutes stated drugs and treatments were now “ideally” proved during experimental testing but added: “Currently false protectors of patient interests inhibit novel treatment development by upholding a so-called gold standard that excludes the possibility of/fails to recognise this kind of testing … “Patients themselves are typically willing for their data to be used in responsible ways; it is with these ‘protector’ organisations that the scepticism comes in.” Phil Booth, coordinator of medConfidential, a group campaigning for confidentiality and consent in healthcare, said: “Of course pharma and tech companies will always want more data, but ‘speeding up innovation’ should never mean fewer or weakened protections for patients. “Public trust in use of our health data depends on everyone following the same rules. That means no privileged access, no ‘data VIP lanes’ – and certainly doesn’t mean dropping standards or safeguards just so startups can join in. “If the purpose of something is to make patients’ data available for commercial exploitation, then it doesn’t matter how ‘independent’ it is – many simply won’t trust it.” A government spokesperson said it was proud of its collaborative work with the pharmaceutical industry, the NHS and regulators, and referred to the success of Covid vaccines. “This work is just one example of where we have been able to use our regulatory freedoms resulting from Brexit, such as having an independent sovereign regulator. In future, we will look to build on this collaboration to accelerate research on how to tackle other major public health challenges, such as cancer and dementia.” Prof Martin McKee, the former president of the European Public Health Association, an umbrella organisation for European public health associations, said the use of terms such as “false protectors of patient interests” did not encourage confidence. Colette Goldrick, executive director, strategy, research and partnerships at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said health data was increasingly important in helping researchers to understand disease and develop treatments. A spokesperson for the Bioindustry association said it used the round table to discuss privately, as it had done publicly, the need for clarity about medicine regulation and the Northern Ireland protocol. Johnson & Johnson declined to comment. GlaxoSmithKline has been approached for comment.",News/Society,Radical plans to transform NHS drawn up at drug firms and No 10 roundtable,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/04/radical-plans-to-transform-nhs-drawn-up-at-drug-firms-and-no-10-roundtable
5/4/2022,"Gordon Brown had a surprise in store for Eddie George when he summoned the then governor of the Bank of England to a meeting at 11 Downing Street on bank holiday Monday, 25 years ago this week. For the past two years, Labour’s new chancellor had been working on a plan to give Threadneedle Street the right to set interest rates and now he was ready to tell George about it. Secrecy was complete. The first the City heard of the idea that henceforth it would be the Bank’s job to hit the government’s inflation target, was when it was announced 24 hours later. Accompanying George was his private secretary Andrew Bailey, since elevated to the governor’s office himself. Bailey was there to see George’s surprise at Brown’s news – but now he has to steer the Bank through its trickiest time since independence. The annual inflation rate is 7% – its highest in three decades – and is set to move even further away from the official 2% target. The City expects the Bank to raise borrowing costs to 1% on Thursday – the fourth time in a row it has raised rates. Speaking before the quiet period when the Bank avoids public pronouncements about the looming interest rate decision, Bailey said nobody at Threadneedle Street had seen Brown’s independence announcement coming. “It had, of course, been mused on as a concept for some years – but the idea that the New Labour government would implement it, immediately surprised almost everyone, I think,” he said. Bailey recalled Brown producing a letter outlining his plans. “Eddie, of course, was very supportive of the decision – and the famous letter now sits in the Bank of England’s museum. Though I confess it is not in mint condition, as for a number of weeks after Gordon handed it over, it went around in my briefcase.” Under Brown’s proposal, the Bank had a legal obligation to hit the government’s inflation target. Those responsible for setting interest rates were to be quizzed by MPs; the governor would have to write a letter if inflation deviated more than a percentage point from its target. The chancellor would appoint four outside experts to the Bank’s monetary policy committee, who would set policy along with the governor and four other Threadneedle Street insiders. For the new chancellor, the advantages of the new approach were two fold: the Labour government would get kudos from the financial markets for ceding control over interest rates; and the Treasury would have more time to concentrate on sorting out the UK’s long-standing economic problems. Labour’s 1997 manifesto was kept deliberately vague about the plan, Brown said. “We didn’t want to go into the election saying we would make the Bank independent because the Tories would say interest rates would go up.” The Bank’s reputation was at its zenith during the first decade of independence. Inflation barely deviated from its target and the economy grew steadily. The MPC needed to do little more than give the occasional modest tweak to interest rates, which peaked at 7.5% in 1998. That was to change. By the time the financial crisis of 2007-09 was drawing to an end, the Bank had cut interest rates to 0.5% – then the lowest in its history – and begun the money creation process known as quantitative easing. A second Great Depression was avoided but economic performance remained lacklustre. Bailey said: “Looking back, it’s clear that long-run structural changes had been pushing down on interest rates for many decades prior to the collapse of Lehman. Those became very apparent after the financial crisis.” Bailey thinks these structural factors – such as demographic changes and weaker productivity growth – are likely to prove persistent. Brown said Bank independence had stood up well as a concept but added: “It is going to be tested in a period of stagflation. We have got to get away from the idea that central banks are the only game in town.” Howard Davies, a Bank deputy governor at the time of independence and now chair of NatWest bank, said the Bank had been too slow to raise rates as inflation has gone up, but added: “Are we better off than if we hadn’t done it? Yes. Overall it’s been pretty successful. When it happened, the European Central Bank was being created on a super-independent model and the Fed was independent. Saying interest rates were going to continue to be politically determined would have been a difficult position to sustain. “I said last July that the Bank should be raising rates and if it didn’t, it would eventually have to do more. The Bank didn’t want to spoil the party and I can understand that, but a touch on the tiller would have been sensible. It is dangerous to be seen to be behind the game.” In a speech last year, Mervyn King – governor from 2003 to 2013 – criticised central banks for their King Canute theory of the cost of living, under which inflation will stay low because they “say it will”. There had been a decade of sluggish economic growth despite the largest monetary stimulus the world had ever seen and it was “surely time to recognise that many if not most economic problems are not amenable to monetary policy solutions, King said. Bailey rejected the idea that the Bank has let the inflation genie out of the bottle, yet added: “The inflation targeting framework is going through its greatest test so far. But we need that framework now more than ever.” The governor said the UK economy has been buffeted by a series of “massive shocks”, which have pushed up energy prices and inflation. “The MPC simply doesn’t have the tools to offset a supply side shock like this. That would mean raising interest rates to the point that spending was so weak that the prices of other, domestically produced, goods and services fell. That would be damaging and would go against our mandate to avoid causing excessive volatility in output. But don’t doubt for a moment our absolute commitment to getting inflation back to target.”",News/Business,Independence day: why Gordon Brown gave the Bank the right to set interest rates,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/independence-day-why-gordon-brown-gave-the-bank-the-right-to-set-interest-rates
