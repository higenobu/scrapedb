2/18/2022,"VILNIUS (Reuters) - Russia has amassed 45,000 soldiers in Belarus and their presence is threatening to Baltic states and Poland, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said on Thursday. The joint Russian and Belarus military exercise near the Belarus border with Ukraine is scheduled to end on Sunday. Tensions between Moscow and NATO capitals are high following weeks of United States accusations that Russia has deployed up to 150,000 troops near Ukraine's borders for an invasion. Moscow accuses the West of hysteria and denies it wants to invade. ""They amassed 45,000 troops, a lot of military equipment, air forces. And we do not hear very clearly articulated promises that this will be removed to Russian territory after the military exercise ends. This is one more way to keep the tension up"", said Nauseda in a video statement after an EU leaders meeting in Brussels. ""This creates more potential threats now and for Baltic States and Poland,"" he added. Baltic States - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - as well as Poland are European Union and NATO members. NATO is looking to increase its military presence in the Baltic states and Poland in case Russia keeps its troops in Belarus after the exercise, the head of the alliance's military committee said on Feb. 7.

2/18/2022,"A wealthy Connecticut mother of four has pleaded guilty to secretly filming three people — including a child — for “sexual pleasure” at her $10 million mansion, court records show. Hadley Palmer, 53, pleaded guilty in the state Superior Court in Stamford on Jan. 19 to three counts of voyeurism and one count of risk of injury to a minor for the incidents, the Associated Press reports. She faces up to five years in prison and is required to now register as a sex offender. As part of her plea deal, two more serious charges — employing a minor in an obscene performance and possession of child pornography — were dropped. The recordings and photos were captured between 2017 and 2018, “and at least one photograph taken by the defendant depicted a person who was a minor,"" Blawie wrote in the ruling to seal the case, according to the Stamford Advocate. She apparently secretly recorded the three victims, who were either naked or in their underwear, at her mansion in Greenwich with the ""intent to arouse or satisfy the sexual desire of such person or any other person,"" according to court documents obtained by the Associated Press. Palmer was arrested in 2021. It’s not clear how the mother of four targeted her victims. The wealthy defendant is the daughter of Jerrold Fine, who founded the hedge fund Charter Oak Partners Management in 1976, People notes. In an unusual decision, John F. Blawie, a judge for the Fairfield District Superior Court in Connecticut, sealed the case against her, the Associated Press reported on Monday. Dave Collins, a veteran Associated Press reporter who covers Connecticut cases, argued at a Feb. 1 hearing that Palmer's case should remain unsealed, noting that wealthy people often seal cases for their own benefit, according to the New York Times. He made clear that the case file, if public, could still have all information about the victims redacted. ""The public needs to know how these cases are handled and adjudicated,"" Collins said. ""Everybody else's case is online. Why isn't Mrs. Palmer's case?""

2/18/2022,"RUKLA MILITARY BASE, Lithuania (Reuters) - A German army convoy of 130 soldiers and 60 vehicles reached Lithuania on Thursday, bringing almost half of planned reinforcements for the country's German-led NATO battlegroup amid fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday there was now every indication Russia was planning to invade Ukraine, including signs Moscow was carrying out a false flag operation to provide a pretext, after Ukrainian government forces and pro-Moscow separatists traded fire. The German reinforcement operation will continue until the end of the week, bolstering German forces in Lithuania by more than 350 soldiers and 100 vehicles, Enhanced Forward Presence battlegroup commander Lieutenant-Colonel Daniel Andrae said. ""We have proven that we are capable of bringing in forces at short notice from long distance,"" he told Reuters. The Ukraine crisis has prompted the U.S.-led NATO alliance to shore up its presence along its eastern flank in member states, including Lithuania, closer to Russia or Ukraine. The convoy of artillery and reconnaissance units set out from on Tuesday from Jaegerbrueck in eastern Germany and travelled overland through Poland. It will be followed by howitzers on heavy transport transporters in the next 2-3 days. ""The allied military presence in Lithuania is a critically important deterrence factor (aimed at Russia),"" Lithuanian Deputy Defence Minister Margiris Abukevicius said on Thursday. Norway will also increase its part in the German-led battlegroup by 50-60 soldiers for the next three months, bringing total number of NATO troops there to 1,610, Lithuanian Defence Minister Arvydas Anusauskas said. Britain said it would double the size of its forces in nearby Estonia where it heads a similar NATO battlegroup. NATO has set up four multinational battlegroups in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland in 2017 after Russia annexed the Crimea region from Ukraine. Armed with tanks and numbering over 5,000 troops in total, the battlegroups are set up to act as a tripwire and buy time by holding off any assault until reinforcements arrive.

2/18/2022,"A Wichita mother will serve 16 years, three months in prison for murdering a man who allegedly beat her adult son with a baseball bat in 2020, a Sedgwick County judge ruled Wednesday. District Judge Jeffrey Syrios imposed the prison sentence after denying a request for probation from Amber Kay Ahrens’ lawyer, saying there was “no substantial and compelling basis” to grant her leniency in connection with the fatal shooting of 53-year-old David Leddy on June 17, 2020. Police have said Ahrens confronted Leddy outside of his Wichita home at 1214 N. Pinecrest after he attacked her 19-year-old son for being at his house. She left a local casino and drove around looking for her son before fighting with Leddy in his driveway, police said. Ahrens, 43, claimed she pulled a revolver from her purse and shot Leddy in the head above his left ear after he threatened to beat her, too — circumstances defense lawyer Gerard Scott argued should result in Ahrens getting a break. “Mr. Leddy was an aggressor or participant in the criminal conduct associated with the crime of conviction,” Scott said in a written motion filed ahead of Wednesday’s sentencing. “Amber Ahrens is a caring compassionate person who often puts others first. Caring compassionate people are capable of great rage in situations when they perceive others have suffered wrongs. ... What happened the night of this case was the perfect storm for her acting out on her fear and anger.” After shooting Leddy, Ahrens left his home with a friend and tossed the revolver in a vacant lot, according to her arrest affidavit. Police arrested her three weeks later after witnesses who knew her by the name “Odyssey” identified her. She pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon by a convicted felon ahead of her Nov. 15 jury trial. In addition to serving the 195-month sentence, Ahrens must pay $1,772.63 in restitution to the Crime Victims Compensation Board, DA spokesman Dan Dillon said.

2/18/2022,"(Adds comments from intelligence services chief) By Andrius Sytas Feb 16 (Reuters) - Russia is continuing to move troops to the Ukrainian border and will likely launch a ""limited"" military attack against the country, the head of the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service said on Wednesday. The attack would include missile bombardment and the occupation of ""key terrain"" in Ukraine, said Mikk Marran, director general of the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service. ""Right now, our assessment is that they would avoid cities with large populations, as it takes a lot of troops to control those areas. But there is no clear understanding of what avenue the Russian troops might exploit,"" he told a media briefing held to introduce the service's annual report. Another possibility could be intensified fighting out of the two Russian-backed breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, according to Estonian intelligence. Such escalation is ""highly likely,"" and this way “Russia likely gets plausible deniability and avoids sanctions,” said Marran. “If Russia is successful in Ukraine, it would encourage it to increase pressure on the Baltics in the coming years,"" he said. “The threat of war has become main policy tool for Putin.” Estonian intelligence is aware of approximately 10 battle groups of Russian troops moving toward the Ukrainian border, where 100 Russian military battle groups, or about 170,000 soldiers, are already deployed, the intelligence chief said. The numbers include soldiers usually deployed in regions around Ukraine, but also troops in Belarus which Russia sent for a military exercise near Ukrainian border. Some of the soldiers are likely to stay in Belarus beyond the Feb. 20 end of the exercise, a significant worry for the NATO alliance which the Baltics belong to, said Marran. ""That would reduce preparation time for an attack against the Baltics.” (Reporting by Andrius Sytas in Riga Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Leslie Adler)",World/Reuters,"UPDATE 1-Russia 'likely' to launch 'limited' military attack against Ukraine, says Estonian intelligence",https://news.yahoo.com/1-russia-likely-launch-limited-194935851.html
2/18/2022,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - German Air Force Eurofighters arrived at a military air base in eastern Romania on Thursday as part of a deployment to NATO's eastern flanks amid a Russian military build-up on Ukraine's border, the defence ministry said. The three Eurofighters and roughly 60 soldiers will join Italian and Romanian forces for enhanced air policing missions over the next three weeks. German air forces ran similar missions alongside British air forces in Romania in 2021. They will be stationed at the Mihail Kogalniceanu air base on the Black Sea where a Stryker squadron of 1,000 U.S. service members was relocated earlier this month from Vilseck, Germany. The squadron added to the 900 soldiers Washington currently has rotating in Romania, which borders Ukraine to the north. Earlier this week NATO told its military commanders to draw up plans for new battlegroups in central and southeastern Europe, as it accused Russia of sending more troops to areas near Ukraine instead of withdrawing its forces. Diplomats said four new units comprising a total of around 4,000 troops could be based in Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia in what would be the biggest shift in NATO's military posture since it moved troops to the Baltics and Poland following Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

She's suing Zeltiq Aesthetics Inc. for $50 million, claiming that she's been unable to work since the procedure, which hardened and expanded areas around her bra line, jawline, and thighs instead of shrinking them.

2/18/2022,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A prominent commander of Russian-backed separatists in a breakaway area in eastern Ukraine sought to rally his veteran troops on Thursday, heralding a potential intensifying of the region's conflict. Alexander Khodakovsky, a former political leader in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic who now oversees a military unit, said that ""all who want to rejoin ranks should be ready."" ""At previous meetings with veterans of the militia, the algorithm of actions was discussed, and the places of arrival were indicated. I will inform you of the date and time of the gathering by all available means,"" Khodakovsky wrote on his Telegram account. Earlier in the day, Ukraine's military and the separatists traded fire in a ceasefire violation. The clash caused concern among U.S.-led NATO countries that Russia may use it as a pretext for an attack on its neighbour. Russia has amassed up to 150,000 troops and equipment around Ukraine's borders, the United States says. Moscow denies planning to invade. This week it said it was pulling back some troops and on Thursday it said some had returned to bases from Crimea, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Washington says Russia is not withdrawing, but in fact sending more forces. Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels gave conflicting accounts of shelling across the front in the Donbass separatist region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the pro-Russian forces had shelled a kindergarten, in what he called a ""big provocation"". The separatists, for their part, accused government forces of opening fire on their territory four times in the past 24 hours. Neither account could be verified.

2/18/2022,"Donald Trump has a decision to make on whether to testify or ""take the 5th"" in a civil inquiry. Either choice carries major risk as the former president faces criminal and civil investigations. Trump has said that pleading the 5th Amendment suggests guilt, but experts say it's the smart move. Donald Trump once proclaimed himself so untouchable that he could shoot someone on 5th Avenue in New York City without facing electoral consequences. Pleading the 5th is another matter, both legally and politically. A Manhattan judge on Thursday ordered Trump and two of his adult children — Don Jr. and Ivanka — to sit for a deposition and turn over personal business documents in connection with New York state Attorney General Letitia James' civil inquiry into financial wrongdoing at the Trump Organization. Trump's legal team vowed to appeal. But the ruling creates the real possibility that the former president will appear for sworn testimony about his business at a time when he is facing both civil and criminal scrutiny. For Trump, the prospect of a deposition presents a Catch-22 as he teases another run for president. Trump can invoke his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination, just as his other adult son, Eric Trump, did when he was questioned by the attorney general's office in 2020. And, with a criminal investigation running parallel to James' civil inquiry, legal experts told Insider that ""taking the 5th"" was almost assuredly Trump's best move. But if the former Republican president invokes his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination, James' office could use that against him — as a so-called ""adverse inference"" — in the event it brings a civil lawsuit against the Trump Organization or Trump himself. On the other hand, Trump could avoid dealing himself that legal setback and sit for a deposition. It's risky: The Manhattan district attorney's office, where investigators are also examining whether Trump improperly inflated the value of his assets to receive favorable loans, could use Trump's testimony against him. ""Any good criminal defense lawyer would advise him to take the 5th because the very same allegations are the subject of the criminal investigation, as well,"" said Randall Eliason, a former public corruption prosecutor who now teaches criminal law at George Washington University. ""It seems from the outside that he'd have a legitimate claim of 5th Amendment privilege. That would be the smart thing to do as far as the criminal exposure."" But, Eliason added, ""that is risky for the civil proceeding, because in the civil case that could be used to raise an inference against him."" The New York attorney general's civil inquiry raises the threat of steep fines for Trump and his business, so pleading the 5th could be expensive. But prison time is on the table in any criminal case, and Trump would avoid lending the criminal investigation any fodder by taking the 5th, legal experts said. That move nevertheless carries the risk of causing substantial reputational damage for Trump, who has said that pleading the 5th is ""for the mob"" and only for the guilty. ""Generally, someone with potential criminal exposure is not going to willingly testify in anything. But high-profile cases are different for so many reasons. There are calculations going on that aren't just legal calculations,"" said Jeffrey Bellin, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches criminal law at William & Mary Law School. Under the conventional wisdom, Bellin added, ""it's hard to win an election if you've invoked the 5th Amendment because people will assume you did that because you did some kind of crime."" Trump, however, is a famously unorthodox politician who weathered allegations of sexual and financial misconduct on the way to the presidency. As president, he navigated two impeachment trials and all manner of legal affronts involving his administration, campaign operation, inauguration committee, Washington hotel, and even mental health. Since leaving the White House, Trump has continued to maintain a firm hold on the Republican Party. Eliason predicted that, if Trump takes the 5th, he'll spin the move to supporters as one that he took at the instruction of his lawyers and in the face of prosecutors he has pilloried as ""vicious"" and ""racist."" ""His base will love it,"" Eliason said. ""It just feeds into the whole victimization narrative."" Indeed, if Trump takes the 5th and runs again, it will be only the latest test of his 2016 boast that he ""could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose voters.""
