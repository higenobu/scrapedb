1/10/2022,"It’s nothing new to note that the rise of streaming services has the potential to unleash the screen artwork from its standard length and form. The television documentary maker Adam Curtis, for example, long ago embraced iPlayer rather than linear television for his films, because on the streaming platform they would find a home away from the “rigid formats and schedules of network television”. In 2015, his film Bitter Lake, about the banal narratives imposed on a complex world by reductive world leaders, occupied two hours and 20 minutes – more time than he would have been allotted by even the most indulgent channel controller. In audio, podcasting has long liberated itself from the tight, clock-regulated schedules of radio. James Cameron, the director of Avatar and Titanic, has now mooted a world in which there is further freedom from time constraints: he imagines movies with a long-form version made for streaming, and a shorter version for the cinema – the cinema being a space, in many cultures, traditionally ruled by the ineluctable timetable of the human bladder (though Bollywood films, for instance, are long, and the bladder issue is easily dealt with by an acceptance that audience members will come and go from the auditorium). “I want to do a movie that’s six hours long and two-and-a-half hours long at the same time,” Cameron told Variety magazine. “Same movie. You can stream it for six hours, or you can go and have a more condensed, rollercoaster, immersive version of that experience in a movie theatre … Why not? Let’s just use these platforms in ways that haven’t been done before.” It is a fascinating notion and one that, if enacted, would cast light on the underrated work of the editor in film and TV, beyond the emergence of directors’ cuts of films from time to time (which are not invariably superior to, and often rather longer than, the usually tighter and more ruthless versions originally released by the studio).  The potential freedom for artists to be liberated from the strictures of scheduling and “acceptable” lengths is not necessarily a good thing, of course. Nobody wants to watch a maundering, meandering, overlong artwork that could have said all that it needed to say within 30 minutes or could easily have had an hour sliced out of it. The most recent James Bond film, at two hours 28 minutes, was felt by many people to be “too long” for its material. On the other hand, length is a curious business in time-based art. The speed at which minutes appear to pass has little to do with the actual progress of hands round a clock face. In the right hands, a work as mighty in scale and length as The Valkyrie – as evinced by its recent reappearance on the stage of the Coliseum in London with English National Opera – can slip by, although the official run time was five hours. Wagner’s opera is full of twists and drama, and – perhaps unlike some of his other works – never drags. But scale isn’t everything. Caryl Churchill’s latest play What If If Only, staged at London’s Royal Court, occupied 20 minutes – and yet, in its brief and concentrated span, as it explored loss and bereavement, plumbed depths. The reality is that great artworks find the length they need to be. Getting that right isn’t easy: but it is part of the artist’s job.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the six-hour show: the curious business of lengthy art | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/09/the-guardian-view-on-the-six-hour-show-the-curious-business-of-lengthy-art
1/10/2022,"My friend Malcolm Greenwood, who has died aged 86, was a key figure in education in Bradford. From 1958, Malcolm taught history at Carlton boys’ grammar school, and five years later joined Bradford grammar school. There he started and developed the economics department, later introducing business studies and philosophy. When Malcolm retired from BGS in 1993, his pupils acknowledged how much future students would benefit from his foresight. Malcolm subsequently taught for three years at the Bradford University Management Centre, where he contributed modules to the MA business studies course. He published on management in education and competition in business, and in 2013 published A Life Well Lived, on female experience of the SOE, based on the recollections of his neighbour Fan Craig, a member of the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (Fany) in the second world war.  In the 1950s, it was unusual for those from Malcolm’s modest background to achieve such academic success. Born in Bradford, he was the son of Hilda (nee Piggin), a typist, and Edward Greenwood, a dispensing chemist. From Thornton grammar school Malcolm went to the London School of Economics, and then obtained a PGCE teaching qualification from Hull University. In 1986, he was elected schoolmaster-fellow at Merton College, Oxford, where he completed with distinction an Open University degree in psychology. Malcolm was a great admirer of the OU, for which he was a tutor and counsellor, frequently travelling far afield to teach the social sciences. He was especially keen to encourage mature students. A proud Yorkshireman, Malcolm chaired Bradford’s industry and commerce committee and was an early promoter of heritage tourism. He fought the Bingley Rural ward for the Liberal party in council elections in 1982 and 1983. For more than a decade, he volunteered at the Skipton Citizens Advice Bureau. In 1961 he married Winifred Dean, and they had two children. After her premature death from cancer, he was sustained by his rich hinterland. He was a keen cricketer, golfer and enthusiastic angler. His beautiful tenor voice led to him meeting Anne Wicks at a local choir and the couple were married in 1978. Malcolm is survived by Anne, his daughter, Sarah, and son, Jonathan, from his first marriage, two stepsons, David and Robert, and nine grandchildren.",News/Education,Malcolm Greenwood obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/09/malcolm-greenwood-obituary
1/10/2022,"Donald Trump cannot hide behind immunity from criminal prosecution and faces the possibility of being debarred from running for public office over his role in the Capitol attack, several members of Congress said on Sunday.  Days after the anniversary of the 6 January insurrection that left five people dead and scores injured after Trump supporters attempted to scupper the certification of Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election, the threat of possible criminal proceedings looms large over the former president. Lawmakers from both main parties, including moderate Republicans, warned on Sunday that Trump will not be spared criminal liability should evidence emerge that he actively coordinated the attack. A Republican senator, Mike Rounds from South Dakota, told ABC’s This Week that any immunity from prosecution that Trump enjoyed while in the White House evaporated on 20 January 2021, when he left office. “The shield of the presidency does not exist for someone who was a former president – everybody in this country is subject to the courts of this country,” Rounds said. Rounds added that it was up to the justice department, not Congress, to decide whether evidence existed of criminal wrongdoing by Trump. On Saturday, the Guardian revealed that the House select committee investigating 6 January is homing in on the question of whether Trump led a criminal conspiracy to try and block Biden’s certification as his successor in the White House. Depending on what they find, the committee has the power to refer the matter to the Department of Justice for possible criminal prosecution. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican congressman from Illinois who sits on the committee, underlined the laser-like focus of the investigation on Trump’s potential complicity. Speaking on NBC’s Meet the Press, he said the key question now was: “What did the president know about 6 January leading up to 6 January?” Kinzinger added that the panel wanted to know why Trump failed to take any action for almost three hours while the violence at the Capitol was unfolding on his TV screen. Was it a sign of weakness or complicity? “It’s the difference between, was the president absolutely incompetent or a coward on 6 January when he didn’t do anything or did he know what was coming? That’s a difference between incompetence with your oath and possibly criminal.” While the question of whether the former president broke the law is fast rising up the political agenda, Congress is also considering another potential route to hold Trump accountable for the violence of a year ago: action under the 14th amendment of the constitution. Section three of the amendment holds that nobody in elected federal office, including the president, should engage in “insurrection or rebellion” against the union. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland who led the second impeachment of Trump for “incitement of insurrection”, told ABC the 14th amendment might yet be “a blockade for [Trump] ever being able to run for office again”. In practical terms, however, the chances of a successful bid to bar Trump using the amendment are slim, as it would require a two-thirds vote of both the House and Senate. That appears unreachable given the overwhelming majority of Republicans who have gone along with Trump despite the events of 6 January. While the relatively tiny number of moderate Republicans who have been willing openly to criticize the former president were airing their views on Sunday, the opposing tack taken by most party leaders was also on display. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump loyalist from South Carolina, told a New York radio channel the Capitol attack was a “dark day”, but went on to lambast Biden for marking the anniversary this week. “It was an effort on his part to create a brazen political moment to try to deflect from their failed presidency,” Graham said. A moment of silence staged at the House to mark the anniversary was attended by only two Republicans: the congresswoman Liz Cheney and her father, the former vice-president Dick Cheney. Afterwards, the older Cheney expressed his disappointment at the “failure of many members of my party to recognize the grave nature of the 6 January attacks and the ongoing threat to our nation”. Asa Hutchinson, the Republican governor of Arkansas, attempted to defend congress members from his state, all of whom sat out the anniversary proceedings. “I don’t know that absolute attendance was the only way to show frustration with 6 January,” he told CNN’s State of the Union. But Hutchinson did say he regretted that large numbers of Republican candidates running for public office are openly embracing Trump’s big lie that the 2020 election was rigged. “What worries me is that they are not demonstrating leadership,” he said. “We have to make clear that [6 January] was unacceptable, it was an attempt to stop the peaceful transfer of power and we have to make clear that President Trump had some responsibility for that.”",News/US news,"Capitol attack: Trump not immune from criminal referral, lawmakers insist",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/09/capitol-attack-trump-criminal-referral-raskin-kinzinger-incompetent-coward-14th-amendment
1/10/2022,"Sinéad O’Connor has criticised the Irish authorities after the death of her 17-year-old son, Shane, whom she alleges left hospital while “on suicide watch”. The singer announced the news of Shane’s death on social media on Saturday, writing: “My beautiful son, Nevi’im Nesta Ali Shane O’Connor, the very light of my life, decided to end his earthly struggle today and is now with God.  “May he rest in peace and may no one follow his example. My baby. I love you so much. Please be at peace.” Shane O’Connor had been reported missing two days before his death, with the Garda Síochána launching an appeal for his whereabouts. He was missing from Newbridge, County Kildare, and was last seen on Friday morning in the Tallaght area of Dublin. Officers said they were concerned for his welfare. O’Connor had previously alleged Shane was “on suicide watch”. Like, how has a seventeen year old traumatised young person WHO WAS ON SUICIDE WATCH in Tallaght Hosptial’s Lynn Ward been able to go missing??? Hospital of course so far refusing to take any responsibility. Anything happens to my son on their watch? Lawsuits. In a series of tweets on Saturday night, after police confirmation of his death, the Irish musician condemned authorities including the Irish health service HSE and the child and family agency Tusla, for their “refusal to accept responsibility”. She wrote: “26 hours after my son died in so the so called care of the Irish State in the form of Tusla, I have yet to receive any contact from Tusla or their representatives. I was informed by Gardai of my son’s death and later I spoke with the GAL. No contact from Tusla is unacceptable.” She later posted that she had “formally identified the remains of my son”, adding: “May God forgive the Irish State for I never will”. In another tweet, she said: “Now Tusla want to discuss with me ‘a media release’ no doubt wishing to have me join in their efforts to make this death of my child seem like it wasn’t at the hands of the Irish State.” An HSE spokesperson said: “The HSE cannot comment on individual cases when to do so might reveal information in relation to identifiable individuals, breaching the ethical requirement on us to observe our duty of confidentiality.” Tusla and Tallaght hospital have been contacted for comment. Shane was one of O’Connor’s four children, along with Jake Reynolds, Roisin Waters and Yeshua Francis Neil Bonadio. She also tweeted a Bob Marley song, which she dedicated to Shane, describing him as her “blue-eye baby” and the “light of my life”. The singer has been sent thousands of messages of condolences on social media, including from public figures and other mothers who have gone through similar ordeals. The Pogues singer Shane MacGowan tweeted: “Sinead you have always been there for me and for so many people, you have been a comfort & a soul who is not afraid to feel the pain of the suffering. “You have always tried to heal & help. I pray that you can be comforted & find strength, healing & peace in your own sorrow & loss. “He was a beautiful boy and I loved him.

1/10/2022,"My father, Danny Sharpe, who has died aged 84, spent most of his career as a civil servant, helping to bring investment and opportunities to the north-east of England. He joined the civil service in 1959, entering at the lowest clerical officer grade. Eventually he became deputy regional director for the north-east at the Department of Trade and Industry.  Danny was born in Blyth, Northumberland, the son of Elizabeth (nee Donnelly) and Daniel Sharpe, who worked in insurance. On leaving St Cuthbert’s grammar school, Newcastle, at the age of 15 with no qualifications, he worked as a door-to-door salesman and delivery van driver, and then undertook national service in the RAF. His civil service career began at the the Ministry of Transport and Aviation in London under the national service resettlement programme. After 10 years he seized an an opportunity to return to the north-east, working at the new Ministry of Technology. He was attracted by the optimistic outlook of Harold Wilson’s “white heat of technology” drive, bringing scientific advances into industry. The loss of traditional industries in coal mining, steelmaking and shipbuilding meant that the region needed creative solutions. Throughout the 1980s and 90s, he was often called on to brief ministers and also to accompany members of the royal family on visits to the area. In 1992 he was appointed to chair the Recharge North East initiative by the energy minister. Danny led export trade missions to south-east Asia, Europe and North America, which brought significant investment successes. In his final posting, a secondment to a private sector company, the Newcastle Initiative, in 1994, he raised finance to kickstart local initiatives as well as funding the clean-up of the historic buildings of Newcastle’s Grainger Town and lighting the famous Tyne Bridge. In 1991 he was appointed OBE. He retired in 1995 and the following year was awarded an honorary fellowship of the University of Northumbria. Outside his work, Danny was a keen amateur artist, and visitors to the house would invariably leave with at least one painting under their arm. A practising Catholic, he devoted many hours to St Cuthbert’s church, Kenton. He also served on the board of the Northumbrian Industrial Mission, placing chaplains in industry. In 1959 Danny married Sheila Young.

1/10/2022,"One of the most useful qualities of labor unions is their ability to force Good Liberals to actually demonstrate their principles in a tangible way. It is easy for a self-proclaimed progressive business owner to say all the nice things about how they believe in equality and fair wages and worker rights – but when their employees unionize and come to claim those rights, those nice bosses must stop talking about how nice they are, and prove it. For limousine liberals, dealing with unions is where the rubber hits the road.  Needless to say, many Good Liberals turn out to be charlatans. There is a saying in the union world: “A boss is a boss.” This is a more pithy way of saying: “A boss is kind of a greedy jerk, no matter how many ‘Nevertheless, she persisted’ bumper stickers they have plastered on their Volvos.” The New York Times is one of America’s most vital totems of mainstream liberalism, right up there with expensive coffee and defensive explanations for sending your kids to private school. The New York Times is also, it turns out, one of America’s very best examples of how a boss is a boss. Because even as the paper pontificates about the dangers of inequality and gives sympathetic coverage to major union drives, the leaders of the company’s business side are busily trying to undermine their own unions. Last April, 650 tech employees at the New York Times announced that they were unionizing. Rather than applauding them and proceeding to negotiate a contract, the company instead refused to voluntarily recognize the union. This is despite its own editorial board supporting a bill that would have made it legally binding for employers to voluntarily accept union requests when they are backed by a majority of the staff. As the paper’s own editorial explained: “Under current law, an employer can reject the majority’s signatures and insist on a secret ballot. But in a disturbingly high number of cases, the employer uses the time before the vote to pressure employees to rethink their decision to unionize.” Now, this is what the New York Times company is accused of doing to its own employees. Since last year, the Times has been accused of trying to scare workers into changing their minds – to sow division among the employees, divide the unit, and erode support for organized labor. Last week, federal labor regulators claimed that the company had broken the law by telling large swaths of employees that they were actually “managers”, and that they were therefore prohibited from publicly supporting the union. (A hearing is scheduled for this March. A spokesperson for the Times said they “strongly disagree” with the union’s allegations.) If you find this sort of anti-union behavior from the New York Times surprising, remember that another unit of unionized workers at the paper, those who worked for the product review section Wirecutter, had to go on strike during the busy Black Friday shopping weekend in order to secure a minimally fair contract. So while most of the editorial employees at the Times have been unionized for decades, the company is still exhibiting a chesty commitment to doing everything possible to keep any more of its workers from securing the same sort of benefits. I don’t want to get caught up here in the details of labor regulations and lose sight of the big picture. Which is this: the New York Times Company, which makes its money by branding itself as the foremost defender of liberal American values, is fighting against its own workers pursuing their right to organize a union and bargain collectively. To me, that makes the New York Times an anti-union company. I can say this with no qualms. Companies that are not anti-union will honor a formal request from their employees for voluntary union recognition; they will bargain fair contracts that include pay equity for all; and they will certainly not run internal messaging campaigns trying to convince their employees that unionizing is a bad idea. The New York Times has done all of these things, quite recently. This means that it can stand proudly with its dishonorable peers across corporate America in that regard. While its writers editorialize against the deep political and economic problems plaguing our country, its management is very much a part of those problems. The New York Times gets away with a lot. They are the journalism equivalent of the supreme court. They offer prestige, big budgets and job stability at a time when those things are in short supply in this industry. The half of our country terrified by Trump sees them as an army of truth, and everyone in media wants to work there. (Call me!) But let’s be honest: the people who control the New York Times company are acting like real weasels. It’s not just that they are hypocritical, yammering about the public good while acting from pure selfishness – it’s that they want to have it both ways. While more outwardly evil media bosses like Rupert Murdoch may be proud to embrace their Ayn Randian reputation, those who lead the Times want to be accepted as good people on the Brooklyn-brownstone cocktail party circuit, even as they quietly try to stop those who work from them from having an equal seat at their tastefully appointed table. Screw that. I have covered hundreds of anti-union campaigns. No matter where they happen, they are all based on lies and fear. Whether they happen at an Amazon warehouse or at the New York Times, they are a demonstration of contempt for the idea that an employee may deserve to be treated as someone whose humanity is just as real as that of an employer. Respectable people don’t engage in union-busting. People who run anti-union campaigns are not Good Liberals. Hundreds of workers raising their voices have not been enough to convince the New York Times executives to act right. Maybe it’s time to stop inviting them to the cocktail parties.

1/10/2022,"Electronic advertising screens that have been criticised for blocking pavements in Manchester each use the same amount of energy as three households, the Guardian has learned. The council-branded screens, which became a pedestrian bugbear when they were covered with mysterious grey boxes during their installation, earn the local authority £2.4m a year in rent from the advertising firm JCDecaux, plus 2.8% of the revenue from each advert.  In recent weeks the boards have advertised GB News and Floki, a cryptocurrency whose marketing is being investigated by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). According to analysis of data revealed by a freedom of information (FoI) request, each of the 86 digital advertising boards in Manchester city centre uses 11,501 kWh of energy every year. Manchester city council, which declared a climate emergency in 2019, says the screens are powered by renewable energy, but they are connected to the mains supply, rather than powered, for example, by a solar panel. “JCDecaux’s electricity supplier has supply agreements with independent UK wind generators and purchases renewable electricity certificates and renewable energy guarantees of origin (or Regos),” a council spokesperson said. “The council’s aim of becoming zero-carbon by the year 2038 isn’t about not using electricity at all. This would be an absurd assumption. What it does mean is about a cultural change locally, which the council is trying to effect, to use electricity which is renewably sourced and does not involve the burning of fossil fuels to generate.” Regos have been criticised for loopholes that risk “double counting” the UK’s renewable energy use or even claiming foreign renewables as its own.The screens, which are almost three metres tall and a metre wide, have been condemned for taking up valuable pavement space in a city that claimed it wanted to prioritise pedestrians. Asked why the boards could not take space away from cars instead of pedestrians, a council spokesperson said: “The placement of advertising boards in the road would not meet the criteria of highways safety.” No equality impact assessments were done before the installation of the boards, but the council insisted that the placement of each would pass the “double buggy test”, by ensuring sufficient room is provided to allow pedestrians to pass. In its brochure for the boards, under the heading “inclusivity and accessibility”, JCDecaux shows only a picture of a blind man with a cane and the caption “unit easily detectable by people using a white cane”. Of the boards, 22 are able to monitor pedestrian footfall and air quality – something the council says will only be used internally to inform policy. All but five of the 86 units replaced previous backlit paper displays and columns that had been in place since the late 1990s. All advertising appearing on the boards must comply with the ASA’s code of practice, the council said. Roberta Fusco, the interim director of policy and communications for the walking charity Living Streets, said: “Creating streets that encourage walking has huge potential to reduce congestion and air pollution, tackle loneliness and isolation, and revive our local high streets. Cluttering streets with electronic advertising boards flies in the face of that. “Local authorities need to prioritise clearing footways and pavements. This includes banning advertising boards, removing excessive signs and utility boxes, and ensuring there is always at least 1.5 metres of pavement space left when street furniture is in place.”",News/UK news,Manchester electronic ad boards use energy of three households each,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/09/electronic-advertising-boards-manchester-energy-use-consumption
1/10/2022,"The number of Covid reinfections reported in Spain in the past fortnight has exceeded the total number of repeat infections documented during the rest of the pandemic, according to the latest data from Spanish researchers. In the span of two weeks in late December and early January, 20,890 reinfections were reported in Spain, figures from the state-backed Carlos III Health Institute suggested.  While the bulk of cases appeared to be mild, the number is higher than the 17,140 cases of reinfection documented from the start of the pandemic to 22 December. The Spanish data includes both confirmed and suspected reinfections. Researchers attributed the growing number of repeat infections to the fast-spreading Omicron variant. “Prior to this variant, reinfections were anecdotal at the global level,” the immunologist Prof Alfredo Corell, from the University of Valladolid, told the Spanish news site Nius. “Omicron has changed this paradigm.” The Spanish data adds to previous research that has linked Omicron to an increase in reinfections. A report released by researchers at Imperial College London in mid-December estimated the risk of reinfection with Omicron to be 5.4 times greater than with Delta. “This study provides further evidence of the very substantial extent to which Omicron can evade prior immunity given by both infection or vaccination,” the study lead, Prof Neil Ferguson, said in a statement at the time. The report, modelled on people who tested positive in England in late November and early December, added impetus to a call by scientists to include reinfections in UK Covid figures. In South Africa, where the Omicron variant was first identified, preliminary research suggested the variant appears to be reinfecting people at three times the rate of previous strains. “Previous infection used to protect against Delta but now, with Omicron, that doesn’t seem to be the case,” said Prof Anne von Gottberg, from South Africa’s National Institute for Communicable Diseases, in early December. The findings from the UK and South Africa were echoed online by the World Health Organization in late December. “Individuals who have recovered from Covid-19 are three to five times more likely to be reinfected with Omicron compared with Delta,” it said in an update on Covid-19. A limited study in the United States suggested that those who are reinfected with Omicron may experience fewer and milder symptoms compared with infections from previous strains of the virus. The study, published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, looked at a cluster of Omicron cases in a family of six in Nebraska and found that the five reinfections were reported to be less severe than previous bouts of the virus. In Spain, the researchers pointed to several factors that may explain the rising number of reinfections. “Either the virus mutates or a person’s immunity wanes,” said Dr Pere Domingo, the Covid coordinator at Barcelona’s Santa Creu i Sant Pau hospital, in comments to El País. “In this wave, we’ve seen both factors at play.” Others suggested that the potential for reinfection was magnified given the large number of Covid-19 cases being reported. “Even if the possibility of reinfection is small – say, one out of 100 – if there are millions of infections, the reinfections will be in the tens of thousands,” Prof José Antonio López Guerrero, of Madrid’s Autonomous University, told Nius. Recent weeks have seen the number of Covid cases in Spain rise to record highs, pushing the 14-day infection rate to 2,723 cases per 100,000, according to the latest figures from the health ministry. To date, the sharp rise in cases has not resulted in a surge of hospitalisations; the number of patients in intensive care units is about half that of the figure from a year earlier. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said last month he was confident that the country’s high vaccination rate – hovering at about 80% of the population – would translate into a milder wave as the country grapples with the Omicron variant. “We are obviously going to see high numbers of infections, but not hospitalisations and ICU admissions compared to previous waves,” he told reporters.",News/World news,Spain reports more Covid reinfections in one fortnight than rest of pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/09/spain-reports-more-covid-reinfections-in-one-fortnight-than-rest-of-pandemic
