2/26/2022,"Coinbase Ventures investor Katherine Wu is leaving the company for early-stage crypto venture capital firm Archetype, less than a year after joining Coinbase as a senior deal lead in September. The move was first reported by Bloomberg. ""[T]oday is my last day at coinbase sometimes you take that leap of faith and it just doesn't land quite right- that's ok!"" Wu wrote in a tweet on Friday announcing her departure. Wu will work as a venture partner at Archetype, an early-stage VC founded by Ash Egan, who is an investor in a number of prominent crypto startups, including Chainalysis, BlockFi and FalconX, according to the firm's website. Egan, who previously co-founded ConsenSys Ventures, has invested in renewable bitcoin miner US BTC Corp. and proof-of-attendance startup POAP through Archetype. Wu told TechCrunch in a written message that she was ""really excited to be back doing what [I] do best -- lead investment in founders in crypto looking to raise their first round."" She said she hopes to continue to find ways to make crypto more accessible, citing the example of the ""Around The Block"" podcast she co-hosted for Coinbase on industry trends. Coinbase Ventures had its most active year yet in 2021, investing in nearly 150 deals. Archetype, formerly known as Acrylic, raised $55 million last summer from limited partners, including Cendana Capital, as well as Accolade Partners, Accomplice and Digital Currency Group. The Brooklyn, New York-based fund's mandate is to invest between $500,000 and $1.5 million into early-stage crypto startups, The Wall Street Journal reported in July. Wu will invest alongside Egan and principal Danny Sursock, the only two Archetype employees currently listed on the firm's website. Archetype and Coinbase could not be reached for comment.

2/26/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s flagship crude oil was offered for sale at a record discount as some buyers and shipping companies fretted over potential sanctions by the West following the country’s invasion of Ukraine. Oil freight transportation costs boomed. Most Read from Bloomberg Russia Invasion of Ukraine Ignites European Security Crisis Biden Cites Turmoil for Russia’s Ruble, Markets: Ukraine Update Russia Hits Airfields; Kyiv Imposes Martial Law: Ukraine Update Stocks Rise as Oil Pares Gain After Biden Address: Markets Wrap Six Early Thoughts on Russia's Invasion of Ukraine The nation’s Urals crude was offered at $11.60 a barrel below Dated Brent, a marker for physical oil transactions in Europe and beyond. That’s the deepest discount in at least 11 years of data compiled by Bloomberg. There were no bids. Separately, a large tender for the grade also went unsold. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made the market leery of a sanctions backlash. Officials at three large oil tanker companies, two shipbrokers, four oil traders, and one refinery all said that Russia-related activity has been put on hold for now. The country sends about two-thirds of its exports by sea to end-users, with many of those cargoes handled by traders. The West is threatening further punishing sanctions after Russian forces attacked targets across Ukraine and President Vladimir Putin vowed to “demilitarize” the country and replace its leaders, triggering the worst security crisis in Europe since World War II. “Buyers in Europe will probably avoid taking Russian crude as long as the tensions remain elevated even if U.S. does not impose full scale sanctions,” said Alex Kavouris, lead oil analyst at Facts Global Energy. Crude Rush The offer to sell Urals at $11.60 a barrel below Dated Brent on a pricing window organized by S&P Global Platts was for supplies delivered to Rotterdam and is bigger than any other such discount in at least 11 years. Platts also said it wouldn’t publish bids, offers, trades and market values for oil loading in the Black Sea. Freight rates from Russia’s Baltic Sea soared, according to the Baltic Exchange in London. The daily earnings for a tanker moving a 100,000 ton cargo of Urals crude from the region into Europe jumped by almost 800%, reaching $121,741 and underscoring the reticence among some owners about taking Russian cargoes. The situation has prompted a rush for crude from other parts of the world, according to Lars Barstad, the chief executive officer of the management unit of Frontline Ltd., one of the world’s largest owners of supertankers. “Buyers are looking to source crude from safe suppliers,” he said, adding that the markets for supertankers are “already reacting.” Traders are looking for barrels from suppliers including the Middle East, West Africa, the Middle East and Brazil, and rates for chartering the giant supertankers are climbing as a result, according to Barstad. In the U.S., traders at a large refiner and an oil-product blender have been advised by their companies not to purchase any Russian oil to avoid potential delivery snarls in the event of further sanctions by the Biden administration, according to people familiar with the matter. Another oil-trading company has been told by its management to only purchase Russian oil cargoes that are sold on a delivered basis where cancellation of the transaction would be permitted, a separate person said. Big Impact A loss of Russian crude -- if it were to happen -- would come at a terrible time for the global oil market, where inventories have slumped and demand is surpassing supply. Russia shipped about 3 million barrels a day of crude by sea each day in December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That constituted roughly two-thirds of its total exports. “The conflict will result in a significant shift in trade flows, at least temporarily, with less risk-averse Asian buyers stepping in to buy Urals and Russian products,” said Livia Gallarati, an analyst at Energy Aspects Ltd. “Which means Urals and products differentials have to correct lower to clear east.” This should see European buyers willing to pay higher prices for the North Sea grades Forties and Johan Sverdrup, while those with Middle Eastern term deals should nominate full volumes for April, she said. Brent rose above $105 a barrel on Thursday, gaining as much as 9.2% at one stage. Companies that are due to carry out contracts in the Black Sea will now find themselves in the difficult position of deciding whether to perform or to turn back, each with costly consequences, said Andrew Brooker, managing director at marine insurance broker Latitude Brokers. Insurers would decline to cover a trip that could soon breach sanctions. On the other hand, not fulfilling contracts also runs the risk of litigation, he said.

2/26/2022,"By Diane Bartz (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday sued to stop UnitedHealth Group's $8 billion acquisition of Change Healthcare, saying the deal would give the largest U.S. health insurer access to its competitors' data and ultimately push up healthcare costs. UnitedHealth announced the all-cash deal in January 2021, saying it would help streamline administrative and payment processes. UnitedHealth and Change Healthcare offer competing software for processing healthcare claims and together serve 38 of the top-40 health insurers in the country, the Justice Department said in the complaint. They would have at least 75% of that market, it said. The Justice Department said UnitedHealth knew that access to claims would give it a view into rival health plans at Humana Inc, Anthem Inc, CVS Health Corp's Aetna and Cigna Corp. ""Unless the deal is blocked, United stands to see and potentially use its health insurance rivals’ competitively sensitive information for its own business purposes and control these competitors’ access to innovations in vital healthcare technology,"" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Doha Mekki of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division said in a statement. UnitedHealth said it would fight the lawsuit. ""The Department's deeply flawed position is based on highly speculative theories that do not reflect the realities of the healthcare system. We will defend our case vigorously,"" it said in a statement. The lawsuit is a continuation of a tougher approach to antitrust by the Biden administration, which has killed a planned deal by Aon Plc and Willis Towers Watson Plc, and Lockheed Martin's plan to buy engine maker Aerojet Rocketdyne. Healthcare was among the markets listed as an antitrust priority in a White House executive order issued last summer. The tougher stance casts a shadow on several other recently struck multibillion-dollar deals. Citi analyst Daniel Grosslight said the companies are unlikely to want to take part in a protracted lawsuit for an asset Citi views as ""nice to have"" for UnitedHealth. Change Healthcare's shares rose about 3% to $20.84, below United's Jan. 5, 2021 offer price of $25.75 per share. UnitedHealth closed off less than 1% to $455.89. The Justice Department said the deal would give UnitedHealth access to large amounts of sensitive information from its rivals. It said in the complaint, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, that it would impact cost of health insurance by employers and their employees. The case was assigned to Judge Carl Nichols, a former clerk to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Nichols was nominated to the court by President Donald Trump. Seth Bloom, a veteran of the Justice Department now in private practice, called the filing ""a strong and non-frivolous complaint."" Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat and advocate of tougher antitrust enforcement, said he was ""glad to see"" the Justice Department challenge the deal, which he said would ""raise healthcare costs and expand a corporate giant."" An official with United's Optum business, which would absorb Change if the deal goes through, told Reuters it has for years had access to and safeguarded the very same information that the Justice Department is concerned about. UnitedHealth has not had access to this information, the official said. The American Hospital Association has been critical of the deal, arguing that combining healthcare data from Change with UnitedHealth's Optum would reduce competition for the sale of healthcare information technology services for hospitals. Other critics have included the American Medical Association and two groups of independent pharmacists.

2/26/2022,"America's fast-food giants have a lot on the line amid the escalating situation between Russia, Ukraine and the rest of the world. That's in large part because Western fast-food players have expanded significantly into Russia with their cheap burgers and fried chicken over the past 20 years. By Yahoo Finance's calculations, McDonald's, Papa John's, KFC, Pizza Hut, Burger King and Starbucks operate about 2,700 restaurants in Russia. The two largest players are McDonald's and Yum! Brands' KFC — with a total of roughly 1,900 locations. It's unclear if Russia will move to shutter these U.S. born fast-food spots as the West deploys sanctions to penalize the country for its invasion of Ukraine. But, executives in the industry are moving quickly to tamp down any concerns among investors of potential lost business. ""I guess my only rationale is that there is some concern that these actions today [invasion] will have an impact on our company and what I can tell you is that we don't see it that way. One of the great things about being in the food business as is that through good times and bad usually the business is pretty stable. We are very, we are globally diverse company. We operate in 50 countries,"" Papa John's CEO Rob Lynch said on an earnings call Thursday. Lynch was responding to a question on the sharp reaction in Papa John's stock following the company's solid earnings report earlier in the day. Papa John's operates 186 stores in Russia, per its latest annual report. At the same time, the fast-food industry is warning investors that the heated geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine could impact future business results overall. It's just a matter of investors doing their due diligence on the companies to understand the exposures. ""Escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine and any potential military incursion of Russia into Ukraine could adversely impact macroeconomic conditions, give rise to regional instability and result in heightened economic sanctions from the U.S. and the international community in a manner that adversely affects us and our Concepts’ restaurants located in Russia and Eastern Europe, including to the extent that any such sanctions restrict our ability in this region to conduct business with certain suppliers or vendors, and/or to utilize the banking system and repatriate cash,"" said Yum! Brands in its just released annual report. Burger King-owner Restaurant Brands offered up similar language in its new annual report. ""The conflict between Russia and Ukraine could adversely impact economic conditions and demand for dining out as well as result in heightened economic sanctions from the U.S., Canada and other countries in a manner that may adversely affect us and our franchisee’s restaurants located in Russia and Eastern Europe,"" the report stated. Burger King has more than 550 sites in Russia. The concern on fast-food's exposure to Russia — and an inflationary environment in the U.S. that is crimping profits — is being reflected in the stock prices. The S&P Restaurant Index has tanked 15% since hitting a 52-week high on Dec. 31. Shares of McDonald's, Restaurant Brands and Yum! Brands are down 10% on average year-to-date, per Yahoo Finance Plus data analysis. McDonald's is the worst-performing food stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average — shares are down 8% year-to-date, compared to a 4% gain for Coca-Cola.

2/26/2022,"In a recent note, Goldman Sachs chief global equity strategist Peter Oppenheimer points out that markets are going to normalize again, and soon – but with some differences over the recent past. Oppenheimer notes that mega-cap tech stocks have seen outsized gains, and that in much of the economy, we are seeing an evolution of everything into ‘tech companies.’ There’s no denying that digital tech and wireless networking are changing the ways that we do business, across the board. But while the tech mega-caps for the most part have propped up the markets for the past year, many other stocks have taken sound beatings. However, Oppenheimer believes we are returning to a more “normal” cycle. “We expect investors to be rewarded for making sector and stock decisions related to potential growth relative to what is priced,” he said. So let’s get away from what the markets have priced in, and start looking at that potential growth. GS analysts have done just that and following strategist Oppenheimer’s lead they are picking out stocks with upside ahead. These are names which have taken a beating over the past year but are projected to yield nice returns over the next 12 months – in the order of 50% or more. Using the TipRanks platform, we’ve looked up the details on these Goldman picks. Here they are, along with commentary from the analysts. KnowBe4 (KNBE) If the market is evolving towards a more tech-centered orientation, then it follows that digital tech security will become more important than ever. KnowBe4 is a leader in the field, and since its founding in 2010 the company has developed a reputation for building strong online security systems. It does this by training its customers’ workforces, to bring a higher level of digital security awareness to today’s office cultures. KnowBe4 has over 47,000 enterprise clients globally, subscribing to the firm’s online classes and services. The company’s offerings are supported in multiple languages, and customers can use KnowBe4’s platform to simulate phishing attacks – a method that truly drives home the lessons in online security. This company took advantage of last year’s rising stock market to go public. In April 2021, KnowBe4 held an IPO in which it put over 9.5 million shares on the market, with initial pricing at $16. This price was at the low end of the expected range – but the stock opened at more than $19 on April 22, and closed that day above $24. The offering raised well over $152 million gross proceeds. Since the IPO, KNBE shares have retreated – and are down by 47% from the peak value they reached in June. The news on KNBE has been upbeat lately, even though the stock has been feeling heavy pressure. The company released its 4Q21 numbers earlier this month, and beat on EPS by a wide margin. Markets had expected a nominal 1-cent per share profit – but the company reported 7 cents. Top line revenue also beat, but by a narrower margin; the number came in at $69.3 million, against a forecast of $67.2 million. Since the IPO, it was the third quarter in a row to show a sequential revenue gain. And better for investors, the company raised its forward guidance for full-year 2022 revenue by 6.7%. Goldman’s Brian Essex takes an upbeat view of KnowBe4’s prospects, writing, “…as the company focuses on platform expansion, penetration of International markets, progress up market, and better attach rates, potential for upside to initial FY22 growth outlook offsets potential investment-related margin softness in our view. With the stock trading at 11.8x EV/NTM revenue as of market close, implying 0.3x EV/Sales/Growth, we view valuation attractive for a company delivering growth and cash flow at these levels while establishing a track record of outperforming relative to expectations.” Essex gives KnowBe4 a Buy rating and his $32 price target implies a one-year upside of 69%. (To watch Essex’s track record, click here.) KnowBe4’s Moderate Buy consensus rating is supported by 9 recent reviews, including 6 to Buy and 3 to Hold. The stock is selling for $18.92 and its average price target of $31 suggests an upside of 64% over the next 12 months. (See KnowBe4’s stock analysis at TipRanks.) Signify Health (SGFY) One of the better trends in the healthcare industry in recent years – and one that was accelerated by the COVID crisis – is the move toward a less facility-centered approach to care. In-home testing, diagnostics, and practitioner consultations, sometimes as an adjunct to or sometimes supported by teledoc services, is becoming more the norm. Signify is stepping directly into this niche. The company works with Medicare and Medicaid plans to provide in-home services to plan members, with a goal of more healthy days at home – and away from a clinic. Signify’s services are based on a nationwide network with more than 9,000 credentialed medical professionals, including physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. The company’s network can observe and document health issues and hazards in the home, identify social determinants of health, and perform diagnostic and preventative services. As an example of Signify’s scale of service, the company completed over 1.4 million in-home health evaluations in 2020. In 2021, Signify entered the public markets through an IPO. The SGFY ticker opened on Wall Street on February 11, 2021 at $32 per share, well above their set price of $24 – which in turn had been raised from an initial range of $20 to $21. The company put over 23 million shares on the market, and raised $564 million in the IPO. SGFY closed at more than $31 on its first day trading – but since then, the stock has fallen steadily, and is now down by 64% in the last 12 months. In its first year as a public entity, Signify has consistently shown revenue in the range between $180 million and $212 million. In the most recent quarter reported, 3Q21, EPS came in at 12 cents, 4x higher than the 3-cent forecast. The company will report 4Q21 results next month. In coverage for Goldman, analyst Cindy Motz writes of Signify, “We like the company’s differentiated home health model that leverages a nationwide, mobilizable clinician network and think they are well-positioned to not only benefit from increasing focus on value-based care (a concept that has been around for a while), but also on what we believe will be increasing trends in more in-home healthcare. We see Signify as one of those unique players that is addressing all three of our fundamental drivers of long-term growth in healthcare technology. Since most people would rather remain in their homes, versus be in hospitals or long-term nursing facilities, we believe Signify’s solution has the ability to address and result in better patient outcomes and lower overall medical costs.” These comments back up Motz’s Buy rating, while her $20 price target indicates room for 55% share growth in the year ahead. (To watch Motz’s track record, click here.) Signify health has picked up 3 analyst reviews since going public and all are positive, making the Strong Buy consensus rating unanimous. The shares are priced at $12.86 and have an average price target of $24.33, suggesting an 89% one-year upside. (See Signify’s stock analysis at TipRanks.) Health Catalyst (HCAT) Home health isn’t the only sea change overtaking the health care industry. Modern data tech has been forcing equally large changes to the sector. Health Catalyst, a software company specializing in data and analytics technology for health care systems, offers a range of products for health care providers to manage data, develop analytical insights, and leverage those to measurable improvements in clinical and financial operations. The company’s products include a cloud-based data platform, data analytics software, and the professional services to back those up. Health Catalyst has seen 5 quarters in a row of sequential revenue gains, starting in Q3 2020. The company’s last report, from 3Q21, showed $61.74 million at the top line. This was up 30% from the year-ago quarter, and up 56% from 3Q19. It’s an impressive rate of revenue growth for any company. On EPS, Health Catalyst typically runs a loss, although in the latest report not as deep a loss as the analysts predicted. In 3Q21, the company reported an EPS loss of 18 cents, against the 22-cent loss expected. Despite consistently beating the forecasts on EPS losses, and consistently growing revenue, Health Catalyst’s shares are down from the peak they reached in July of last year. In those 8 months, the stock has fallen 54%. Goldman analyst Motz, however, sees Health Catalyst in a strong place, and the current low price as a chance to buy in. She writes, “In our view, HCAT represents a well-executed, differentiated, advanced AI Healthcare Technology platform that satisfies all of our fundamental growth drivers of enabling doctors and creating better patient outcomes with its clinical diagnostic tools, as well as lowering costs with its cost-based applications…. Although HCAT is EBITDA negative presently, we see that changing for full year 2023, and then ramping nicely from there (unless HCAT undertakes an acquisition which it has indicated it may have an interest in at the app layer). Additionally, to the extent the company broadens its TAM, we would anticipate its margins being able to grow further beyond their indicated 20%+ range and beyond.” In line with these upbeat comments, Motz rates the stock as a Buy and sets a $48 price target that suggests an upside potential of 76% for the coming year. This is a stock with 5 reviews on record, including 4 Buys against 1 Hold for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target here, $52.60, implies a one-year upside of 93% from the current share price of $27.19. (See Health Catalyst’s stock forecast at TipRanks.)
