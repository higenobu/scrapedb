1/20/2022,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese forces followed and warned away a U.S. warship which entered waters near the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea, the country's military said on Thursday, in the latest uptick in tensions in the disputed waterway. The Southern Theatre Command of the People's Liberation Army said the USS Benfold ""illegally"" sailed into Chinese territorial waters without permission, violating the country's sovereignty, and that Chinese naval and air forces tracked the ship. ""We solemnly demand that the U.S. side immediately stop such provocative actions, otherwise it will bear the serious consequences of unforeseen events,"" it added. The U.S. Navy said the Benfold ""asserted navigational rights and freedoms in the vicinity of the Paracel Island, consistent with international law"". ""At the conclusion of the operation, USS Benfold exited the excessive claim and continued operations in the South China Sea,"" 7th Fleet spokesman Mark Langford said. The United States frequently carries out what it calls freedom of navigation missions in the South China Sea to challenge Chinese territorial claims. China has established military outposts on artificial islands in the waters, which are crossed by vital shipping lanes and also contain gas fields and rich fishing grounds. The South China Sea has become one of many flashpoints in the testy relationship between China and the United States, with Washington rejecting what it calls unlawful territorial claims by Beijing. China claims vast swaths of the South China Sea. Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines all have overlapping claims.

1/20/2022,"Last week, The Daily Show aired footage of its intrepid correspondent, Jordan Klepper, returning to the scene of the crime: the U.S. Capitol on the one-year anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection. Klepper was in the crowd on that fateful day and confronted several pro-Trump rioters moments before they stormed the Capitol in a failed attempt to stop the 2020 presidential election from being certified. One year later, the reunion saw Klepper get in the face of Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), calling the Trump bootlicker and spreader of “The Big Lie”—who’s also been accused of participating in an underage sex plot—“childish.” Jordan Klepper Confronts Matt Gaetz on Anniversary of Jan. 6 Insurrection Well, on Wednesday, Klepper was back—only this time, he focused on Trump supporters who’d gathered for a vigil outside of the jail housing the Jan. 6 insurrectionists. “I had never been to a protest event before the 2020 presidential election,” one man told Klepper. “I had become completely consumed. It took over my life. For three months, I slept in my car. I traveled from rally to rally, from #StopTheSteal event to #StopTheSteal event, for three months, sleeping in my car, going to see the evidence. And then I had to recover. I had PTSD. So, it took me a long time to find myself again. I feel like I just got out of a cult.” But then, things took… a rather unexpected turn when Klepper asked the man if he still believes the election was stolen from former President Donald Trump.
