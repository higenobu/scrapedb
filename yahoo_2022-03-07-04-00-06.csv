3/7/2022,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan hit out on Sunday at Islamabad-based Western envoys who last week urged Pakistan to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine, asking them if they thought Pakistan was their ""slave"". The heads of 22 diplomatic missions, including those of European Union member states, released a joint letter on March 1 urging Pakistan to support a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly condemning Russia's aggression against Ukraine. The move to release the letter publicly was rare. ""What do you think of us? Are we your slaves ... that whatever you say, we will do?"" Khan said while addressing a political rally. In the event, Pakistan, a traditional ally of the West, abstained from voting as the U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly reprimanded Russia for invading Ukraine. ""I want to ask the European Union ambassadors: Did you write such a letter to India?"" Khan said, noting that Pakistan's arch-rival had also abstained. Khan also said European countries had not censured India for its actions in Kashmir, a mountainous region over which Pakistan and India have fought two wars. He said Pakistan had suffered because it had supported the Western NATO alliance in Afghanistan, and instead of gratitude faced criticism. Khan and his government found themselves in the spotlight after he went ahead with a visit to Moscow in late February as fears of an invasion were growing, and met Vladimir Putin a few hours after the Russian president had ordered his troops into Ukraine. ""We are friends with Russia, and we are also friends with America; we are friends with China and with Europe; we are not in any camp,"" Khan added, saying Pakistan would remain ""neutral"" and work with those trying to end the war in Ukraine. On Friday, a Pakistani foreign office spokesman said it was ""not usual diplomatic practice"" for envoys to make appeals such as their letter public, ""and we have made that clear"".

3/7/2022,"Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) on Sunday defended tweeting out a photo from an online meeting with Ukraine‚Äôs president, dismissing complaints that participants were asked not to post anything on social media out of concern for the wartime leader‚Äôs safety. Rubio insisted that his photo of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was shared before he and others were told by the Ukrainian ambassador not to share any information from the meeting. He also claimed that ‚Äúthere was no security risk‚Äù in what he did. The photo remained on his Twitter page Sunday morning. Rep. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) also shared images of Zelenskyy from that meeting while informing their Twitter followers about their participation. ‚ÄúThere were over 300 people on this call,‚Äù Rubio said in an interview with ABC News‚Äô ‚ÄúThis Week With George Stephanopoulos.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe details of the call were emailed to a bunch of people. And it was a nondescript picture unlike any of the others ‚Äï just like the other ones you‚Äôve seen on the air. So there was no security risk there.‚Äù Marco Rubio shrugs off tweeting out Zelenskey's photo during his Zoom call:

""There was nothing secure about that call. The picture is a nondescript picture... There's no risk posed. But you're always gonna have a couple people who want their name in an article somewhere."" pic.twitter.com/D98A2Sx2fY ‚Äî Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) March 6, 2022 Rubio further suggested that people who have complained about him posting the photo have done so because they want media attention. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always going to have a couple people who want their name in an article somewhere,‚Äù the senator said in a separate interview with CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúState of the Union.‚Äù Democratic Reps. Dean Phillips (Minn.) and Jason Crow (Colo.) both called out Rubio and Daines for posting photos. Phillips called the lawmakers‚Äô behavior ‚Äúappalling and reckless ignorance,‚Äù while Crow chastised them for not taking the security concerns seriously. ‚ÄúThe lack of discipline in Congress is truly astounding,‚Äù Crow tweeted. ‚ÄúIf an embattled wartime leader asks you to keep quiet about a meeting, you better keep quiet about the meeting.‚Äù The Ukrainian Ambassador very intentionally asked each of us on the zoom to NOT share anything on social media during the meeting to protect the security of President Zelenskyy. Appalling and reckless ignorance by two US Senators. https://t.co/geolhKxbLp ‚Äî Rep. Dean Phillips üá∫üá∏ (@RepDeanPhillips) March 5, 2022 Zelenskyy has been working from bunkers since Russian troops invaded Ukraine and has survived at least three assassination attempts by Kremlin-backed assassins in the past week, according to a Times of London report published Thursday.

3/7/2022,"Of all the headlines this week on Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, one story in particular, written by my colleague Brian Sozzi, caught my eye: ‚ÄúRussia-Ukraine war is 'a financial war now‚Äô.‚Äù The line comes from Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid who was making the point that the world‚Äôs economies are doing battle too. Before I get into this financial war, I should acknowledge that for the Ukrainians who are fighting and dying for their country, this is very much a real war. Some Ukrainians are angry that its allies are not sending troops to fight. This is what happens when a megalomaniac armed with nuclear weapons has the rest of the world over a barrel. Putin still has a few friends. Belarus, Myanmar, North Korea, Venezuela and Cuba all support Russia (never mind a few third-tier celebrity pals.) And then of course there‚Äôs Russia‚Äôs greatest ally, China, which may be experiencing a bit of buyer's remorse right now. India, Pakistan and Brazil sit on the fence. Besides those few large players and the outliers, the rest of the world is united against Putin and his grasping neo-Stalinism. I was surprised at the sheer volume of weaponry being shipped to Ukraine from NATO, the U.S. and other countries. That, plus the amount of humanitarian aid is significant (see here), and surely speaks to why the Ukrainians are hanging in there. Still, while Ukraine is rapidly becoming the world‚Äôs most militarized zone, we all fear it‚Äôs only a matter of time before the Russians triumph. Which brings us back to the financial war. First of course are the massive and myriad economic sanctions being leveled against Putin and his gang of oily oligarchs. (Forgive the 1950s Pravda-like rhetoric, but if Khrushchev‚Äôs old shoe fits, why not?) The consequences of these moves appear to be significant and mounting. Yes, innocent Russians will suffer hardship (though nothing like the Ukrainians), but unfortunately what choice do we have? Do nothing? Go to war with Russia? (On the somewhat lighter side, who knew that this would be the week that Russian yacht hunting would become a global sport.) To get some perspective on the U.S. government response, I spoke to SEC Chair Gary Gensler. ‚ÄúThe SEC [is] monitoring markets,‚Äù Gensler told me. ‚ÄúWe're staying close with the rest of the Financial Stability Oversight Council agencies and as well as to regulators in the banking and the securities fields across the globe."" ‚ÄúIf you look at funds under management, they total multiples of tens of trillions of dollars of assets under management here in the U.S. Only a fraction of 1% are invested in Russian securities or ADRs. We're going to stay alert for any cyber risks or any other market functioning risks. At least for these handful of days so far, the market functions have been operating relatively well. But what comes tomorrow? What comes in the future?‚Äù That‚Äôs a take from the government side, but to me the more remarkable action has been in the private sector. Before I go all corporate gaga on you, I know it may be the case that some companies seem to be jumping on the ‚ÄúI love Ukraine‚Äù bandwagon. (Note to CEOs and other C-Suiters: It‚Äôs ""Ukraine,"" not ""the Ukraine."" And Kyiv is pronounced ""Keeve,"" rhymes with Steve.) Also we should be careful with statements from companies ""intending"" to exit Russia. To wit: We applaud you Shell, but save the champagne until you are actually out of your Russian joint ventures. (Understanding that finding buyers won‚Äôt be easy. Hello PetroChina? Sinopec?) Tech companies as it turns out may actually benefit from disengaging from Russia as Dan Howley points out here as the move builds goodwill with employees and regulators. Nothing wrong with a little enlightened self-interest. Bottom line though, the list of companies standing up to Putin is long and getting longer by the hour. Check out this ever-updating story from the ever-present Sozzi and Alexandra Semenova. It‚Äôs a huge diverse group; American Express, Apple, Nike, Goldman Sachs, DirectTV, GM, Disney, Harley-Davidson, Boeing, Mastercard, Visa, BlackRock, Warner Media, Dell, the NYSE and Nasdaq. And that‚Äôs just a handful of big American names. Fact is, I can‚Äôt recall ever seeing the private sector so aligned. I spoke about this with Bill Browder (last name rhymes with chowder), a super-interesting guy, who‚Äôs CEO of Hermitage Capital Management and head of the Global Magnitsky Justice Campaign. To say he and Putin have history is an understatement. Quick backstory: In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Browder‚Äôs firm delivered stellar returns by exposing corruption at major Russian companies, bringing about company shake-ups, and boosting share prices. In 2005, Browder was denied reentry to Russia and later became the victim of a Russian government scheme to undermine his firm, he says. Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer hired by Browder to investigate Russian corruption, was arrested and died in Russian custody. Here‚Äôs what Browder told me about the private sector going up against Putin: ‚ÄúIf every Western company stops doing business with the Russians, it's really dramatic. When I started my whole campaign for justice for Sergei Magnitsky, one of the first people I met with was a woman in South Africa named Helen Zille, one of the people involved in the anti-apartheid movement. We talked about how they ended apartheid. She said it was all about the U.S. and Western Europe disinvesting from South Africa. When they became financially isolated, it became too much."" ‚ÄúAnd so I think this is really, really important. When we watch these atrocities unfold in Ukraine, I think it's just to pressure every single Western business, to divest, to stop doing business, to stop supplying goods, to stop supplying services to Russia.‚Äù Thanks in part to a financial war back then, the private sector helped end apartheid. Let‚Äôs hope it can somehow do the same to end Putin. ‚Äî This article was featured in a Saturday edition of the Morning Brief on March 5, 2022.
