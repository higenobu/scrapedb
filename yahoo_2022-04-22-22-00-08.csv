4/22/2022,"As Russian troops tighten their grip on the strategic port town of Mariupol, their strategy is finally becoming clear. Russian military commander Rustam Minnekaev now says the second phase of President Vladimir Putin’s “special operation” is focused on establishing a “land corridor” from the Donbas all the way to Moldova, which would cut off the rest of Ukraine from the sea. “One of the tasks of the Russian army is to establish full control over the Donbas and southern Ukraine. This will provide a land corridor to the Crimea, as well as influence the vital objects of the Ukrainian economy,” Minnekaev said Friday at a meeting with the Union of Defense Industries, as reported by the Russian state-owned Interfax. “Control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Transnistria, where there are also facts of oppression of the Russian-speaking population.” Transnistria is a separatist region of Moldova that has so far not been officially involved in the war despite hosting a Russian military base since the 1990s. The general’s words suggest that Moldova’s sovereign borders would also come under threat from further Russian expansion. Phoney efforts to protect Russian-speaking peoples have often foreshadowed Putin’s imperial invasions. In reality, Russian speakers have been struck down in their hundreds in eastern Ukraine during the brutal invasion. If successful, the strategy would include taking the port of former seaside resort town of Odesa near the Moldovan border, which has suffered sporadic bombardments but no full-fledged invasion so far. Russia’s warship Moskva was hit about 75 miles off the coast of Odesa two weeks ago before it sang en route to Crimea. The refocusing of troops from northern Ukraine to the southern regions of the country has further choked Mariupol, where Ukrainian troops and civilians are holed up in a steel factory surrounded by Russian troops. Satellite imagery identified growing mass graves outside the port city where Ukrainian officials say up to 200 new graves have been dug since April 3. While the Russian military has largely now left northern Ukraine alone save sporadic missile strikes, fresh evidence of Russia’s ruthless tactics there in recent weeks continue to build a case for widespread war crimes. Andrii Nebytov, the head of police for Kyiv region, told CNN that they are examining 1,084 bodies found in the region outside Kyiv, including Bucha, for signs of torture. “These are civilians who had nothing to do with territorial defense or other military formations,” he said. “The vast majority—between 50 percent and 75 percent—are people killed by small arms, either a machine gun or a sniper rifle, depending on the location.” Among the atrocities are evidence of widespread rape and sexual mutilation. The youngest victim who survived to tell her story is just 15, according to CNN. Several female bodies in mass graves show evidence of horrific crimes as well. On Friday, the United Nations Human Rights Office described Russian atrocities against Ukrainians a “horror story of violations against civilians” that shows now sign of abating.

4/22/2022,"A South Carolina man who traveled to Alabama in March to claim responsibility for the death of a missing woman has been charged with her murder. Brian Edward Jones, 62, was formally charged with murder after calling the Bessemer Police Department to confess to his girlfriend’s 2001 murder, according to AL.com. Jones said he killed Janet Jones Luxford, 41, who left her Jacksonville, Florida, home for Alabama shortly before she vanished two decades ago. Luxford was never seen again. “We were in disbelief that somebody had come to us to confess to a murder, much less one that is 21 years old,” said Bessemer Police Lt. Christian Clemons. In March, Jones boarded a bus in South Carolina with the sole purpose of getting the murder off his chest. Once in Alabama, he called authorities to confess that he accidentally killed Luxford and stuffed her body in a suitcase. Lt. Clemons told Birmingham’s WBRC that Jones “sat outside of our station until he finally got up the nerve to give us a call.” Officers were stunned; they hadn’t before heard of Janet Luxford, who was reported missing on Sept. 22, 2002, by her daughter in Napa, California, according to the Doe Network. “It’s not a homicide that we even had on our radar,” Clemons told WBRC. “It’s something that he committed here 21 years ago, and nobody knew that it happened besides him.” On March 29, two days after the shocking confession, Jones led authorities to the area of Harmer Street and Valley Creek, where they discovered a green suitcase containing human skeletal remains, according to AL.com. The Jefferson County Coroner’s Office has yet to make a positive identification. “Although the remains found have not been officially identified, Jones is being charged with the death of Janet Luxford,” police told Birmingham’s WVTM. “The Jefferson County Coroner’s Office is actively searching medical records and using DNA to help identify the remains, but the process could take as long as nine months.” Janet Luxford was last seen in September 2001 after leaving her Ernest Street residence in Jacksonville, as reported by her daughter in 2002. Witnesses later saw the missing woman leaving a Bessemer motel with an unidentified truck driver.  Brian Edward Jones  Photo: Jefferson County Sheriff's Office  Lt. Clemons told WBRC that Luxford relocated from Florida to Alabama to be with Jones. Jones admitted to police that he was the unidentified man who was with Luxford before her death on Feb. 18, 2001 according to AL.com. He remembered the date because it was the same day NASCAR legend Dale Earnhardt died during the Daytona 500 race. According to his confession, Jones said he and Luxford got into an altercation at a motel in the 1100 block of 9th Avenue Southwest in Bessemer when he struck Luxford with a golf club, unintentionally killing her. “So 21 years ago, Mr. Jones was here working as a day laborer,” Clemons told WBRC. “He and Ms. Luxford were boyfriend-girlfriend. She wanted to get money to go back home, which is California, to see her folks and from that, an argument started, to which he described got out of hand, and he ended up hitting her with a club in the throat.” Online records show Jones was booked into the Jefferson County Jail on March 29 on charges of murder and abuse of a corpse. His bail is set at $765,000. Authorities withheld news of Jones’ arrest until they could notify Janet Luxford’s family, which they had on Tuesday, according to AL.com. Jones said he thought about confessing in the past. “He said he thought several times about coming forward but did not want to disappoint his parents,” said Clemons. “He seemed enormously remorseful, and appeared to be someone who had been carrying weight of this around for a long time and was relieved to have it over.” Lt. Clemons, who referred to Jones’ confession as a “once-in-a-career type case,” told AL.com that the defendant admitted to the murder because he was concerned for Luxford’s “eternal destination.” Jail records don’t indicate when Jones is expected to appear in court.",U.S./Oxygen,"Man Confesses To Killing Woman 20 Years Ago, Leads Police To Her Body In Suitcase",https://news.yahoo.com/man-confesses-killing-woman-20-222647751.html
4/22/2022,"Boris Johnson has conceded it is a ""realistic possibility"" that Russia could win the war in Ukraine. He also acknowledged suggestions that the war could last until the end of 2023. The Russian president will ""not be able to conquer the spirit of the Ukrainian people,"" Johnson added. Boris Johnson has said there is a ""realistic possibility"" that the war in Ukraine could continue until the end of next year, but insisted Vladimir Putin would not succeed in trying to ""grind the Ukrainians down."" During a press conference in India Friday, the prime minister was asked about comments from Western officials, who suggested Putin was ""still in a position to win,"" despite making strategic blunders, and whether the war could run on until the end of 2023. Johnson said: ""The sad thing is, that is a realistic possibility. ""Putin has a huge army. He has a very difficult political position because he's made a catastrophic blunder. The only option he now has really is to continue to try to use his his appalling, grinding approach — led by artillery — trying to grind the Ukrainians down. And he's very close to securing a land bridge in Mariupol."" Warning the situation remained ""unpredictable,"" the prime minister praised the ""incredible heroism of the Ukrainians and their willingness to fight."" He added: ""No matter what military superiority Vladimir Putin may be able to bring to bear in the next few months — and I agree it could be it could be a long period — he will not be able to conquer the spirit of the Ukrainian people. ""That is just an observable fact. On the contrary, what he is doing every day is strengthening and reinforcing that will to resist in the people of Ukraine."" Johnson, who is under pressure back home over the long-running partygate saga, said Britain and its allies would ""look at what more we can do militarily,"" highlighting the shipment of armored cars being sent to the region and plans to help ""backfill"" tanks in Poland, as well as economic sanctions, vowing ""wave after wave of intensifying pressure on Putin."" Despite this lack of certainty, the prime minister also revealed that Britain will reopen its shuttered embassy in Kyiv. The British government said in February, days before Russia invaded Ukraine, that its embassy office in Kyiv was relocating temporarily and staff were operating from an embassy office in the Western city of Lviv.
