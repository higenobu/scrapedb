3/6/2022,"It may take years for Vladimir Putin to be defeated in his conquest of Ukraine, Britain’s deputy prime minister has admitted, as Labour accused the government of moving too slowly over sanctions. Dominic Raab said people who thought the crisis could be resolved in days were “deluding themselves” and that Nato would need to “show some strategic stamina” in its bid to force the Russian army to retreat. As the war in eastern Europe entered its 11th day, Raab said Putin was resorting to “ever more brutal tactics to try and wrest back the initiative” given the military campaign run from Moscow had “stuttered”. “I think the bottom line is none of the major cities have yet fallen,” Raab, who is also the justice secretary, told the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme. “But I think we ought to be under no doubt that our mission with our allies is to ensure Putin fails in Ukraine, and it’s going to take some time. “We’re talking about months if not years, and therefore we’ll have to show some strategic stamina because this is not going to be over in days.” Raab rejected Ukrainian calls for a no-fly zone. He said it would provoke a more “direct military conflict” between the western defensive alliance and Russia, marking a “massive escalation” in tensions. “That feeds Putin’s narrative,” Raab said. “Putin wants to say that he’s actually in a struggle with the west. He’s not. This is an illegal invasion of a neighbour whose self-determination, democratic and territorial integrity needs to be protected. We do not want to feed Putin’s narrative.” Amid concerns that ceasefires in safe corridors to allow passage of humanitarian aid had broken down, Raab said it was “always worth keeping the diplomatic door ajar” but that he was “very sceptical about any assurances or commitments that president Putin makes”. He continued: “You can see with the impact of sanctions, which I don’t think he was expecting, the rouble falling, the stock market falling to record lows, the impact on interest rates in Russia. But I don’t think yet that will have created a kind of change of calculus. “We need to keep up that pressure, keep supporting President Zelenskiy in the heroic defence that the people of Ukraine have put up.” Raab added: “The cakewalk into Ukraine that Putin told his conscripts and the Russian people that they were engaged in has not materialised, and that shows the pressure that he’s under.” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, admonished ministers for failing to heed warnings contained in the 2020 “Russia report” from parliament’s intelligence and security committee. Support local charities There are several Ukrainian charities working on the ground. Sunflower of Peace is a charity that helps paramedics and doctors, and has been fundraising for supplies, which includes first aid medical tactical backpacks. United Help Ukraine focuses on providing medical supplies and humanitarian aid, and raising awareness of the conflict. Voices of Children aims to help children affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, providing support through art therapy, psychologists, video storytelling and a number of other methods. The British Red Cross has launched an emergency appeal to help Ukraine. The charity will be updating its webpage with news on the work its team is doing, and how support will be used to help people. Support local journalism English-language news outlets based in the country, such as Kyiv Independent and the New Voice of Ukraine, are covering developments on the ground as the conflict unfolds, using local journalists. The Kyiv Independent says it was created by journalists in order to defend editorial independence. This site on Twitter covers many local journalists in Ukraine. Write to your local MP This can be a way to lobby the British government to place further sanctions on the Russian government and its associates. You can get in touch with your local MP via email or post to their constituency address. Instructions on how to get in touch can be found on parliament.uk. He said Labour MPs would support the economic crime bill’s passage through the Commons, which begins on Monday, but that he was frustrated the government was “going slowly and they they didn’t look at this months ago”. Stressing the importance of unity, Starmer said: “These sanctions could actually be in place by now if the government had a bit of forethought on this. I don’t want to divide, other than to push the government further and faster on this.” He added: “There’s echoes of Afghanistan, which is that the government really only begins to get its act together and respond in the heat of the situation rather than preparing for it beforehand.”",News/World news,"Defeating Putin in Ukraine may take years, says Dominic Raab",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/ukraine-putin-dominic-raab-nato-sanctions
3/6/2022,"Small businesses today are struggling and their optimism is waning. Or are they? Yes: the closely watched Small Business Optimism Index from the National Federation of Independent Businesses dropped in January to a level of 97.1, well off its recent peak of 102.5 in June 2021. Yes: when you ask small businesses about their challenges they’ll name quite a few, from rising costs and supply chain problems to finding and retaining people in this tight labor market. Yes, there is a lot of uncertainty right now. It’s an election year. The stock market is very volatile. Oil prices – partly driven by the Russia/Ukraine war – are rising. The Great Resignation of employees is being usurped by the Great Turnover … of customers. There are more rules and regulations and, of course, there’s that sneaky Covid and who knows what variant is going to suddenly appear and drive customers and employees back inside their homes, shivering with fear behind their masks? It wouldn’t surprise me to see the NFIB’s optimism index for February take another dip when the new report is released next week. It’s been a tough winter. But things are going to turn around quickly for small businesses, which is why I predict that the decline in small business optimism will be only temporary. Why? Because 2022 is shaping up to be a good year for most small businesses, and here’s why. For starters, those companies hurt most by Covid will see brighter skies this year. Airport travelers are still off 20% and diners in cities like New York are down as much as 40% compared with pre-pandemic levels, so there’s much room for recovery. Las Vegas visitors remain almost 30% lower from the beginning of the pandemic and hotel occupancy nationwide lags 16% from pre-Covid levels. This means that there’s nowhere to go but up for small businesses relying on the travel, food and conference industries. And up it will go in 2022. Many companies, from Microsoft and Facebook to financial services firms on Wall Street, are already planning to open up their offices in the next month or so, which will bring hundreds of thousands of workers back to eat lunch, get their dry cleaning done and shop for sundries at local stores in downtown areas that have been devastated by their loss of traffic. Restaurants will enjoy expanded outdoor eating space and a newfound appreciation of takeout and delivery services that will remain active. The real estate market will continue to be strong thanks to a dearth of new housing and a demand for warehousing space. Homebuilder confidence dipped last month, but remains near all-time highs and a record 106,000 homes haven’t even been started. Housing prices are predicted to “re-accelerate”. The number of ships waiting off the California coast has declined to the low 90s, a level down almost 50% from just a few months ago as supply chain problems ease. Industrial production is rising and manufacturing and service levels remain at historically high levels. Personal income and spending are up and are predicted to continue rising. Retail sales are at record levels. Capital is also readily available for small businesses that need it. Demand for Small Business Administration-backed loans for working capital and growth is strong. Loan approvals at traditional banks are on the rise. Other forms of financing – from short-term loans to merchant advances – remain fully available to small businesses. Finally, as federal benefits disappear, schools normalize, health threats dissipate and wages increase, workers are being enticed back to the workforce. All those people working remotely have disrupted the labor market and created an opportunity for small employers who have embraced flexible scheduling and cloud-based technologies and are happy to now find talent outside their local areas and adjust to a new workplace of online meetings and virtual collaboration. So yes, small business optimism has taken a dip. But just wait. That number will rise again very shortly as we put the pandemic in the rear-view mirror and look forward to a very busy (and hopefully profitable) year or two.",News/Business,Optimism is waning but conditions are right for a good year for business,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/06/small-business-optimism-2022
3/6/2022,"Amy Poehler directs this feelgood documentary about Hollywood couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, stars of the popular 1950s sitcom I Love Lucy. It’s a cute (or, depending on how you want to see it, cynical) accompaniment to Aaron Sorkin’s Oscar-nominated drama Being the Ricardos, also produced by Amazon, adding behind-the-scenes context to how the sausage of the TV show was made. We learn briefly about the strain it put on their marriage, though the film ultimately insists on a happy, misty-eyed ending. A series of cassettes provided by Ball and Arnaz’s daughter are a coup for Poehler; the 20 tapes contain recordings of interviews with the late actors. We hear Ball’s distinctive, gravelly voice describing how she grew up watching vaudeville shows with her grandfather and explaining how she was inspired by its school of farce. A cast of actors and academics despair at the thought of a powerhouse like Ball being “mansplained”, and highlight her struggles to get pregnant (she had her first child aged 40). Poehler, herself a gifted comedian, doesn’t include her own voice in the film, though we still get a sense of her feminist perspective.",Arts/Film,Lucy and Desi review – Amy Poehler still loves Lucille Ball in feelgood documentary,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/06/lucy-and-desi-review-amy-poehler-lucille-ball-desi-arnaz-feelgood-documentary
3/6/2022,"A plaque to mark the first female priests ordained into the Church of England is being replaced this week because it only mentioned the male clergy who carried out the ceremony. Bristol Cathedral became the first Anglican church to ordain women as priests on 12 March 1994 at a service for 32 female deacons. But when it came to memorialising the historic move, none of the women involved featured on a plaque in the cathedral, even though they helped pay for it to be made. Instead, in a mark of the controversy of the issue as well as the power of patriarchy at the time, only the men who led the service appeared on the plaque. They were the bishop of Bristol at the time, Barry Rogerson, and the dean of the cathedral, Wesley Carr. But next Saturday, after a long campaign by some of the female priests involved, a new plaque will be unveiled by the current bishop of Bristol, Vivienne Faull. The new Welsh slate plaque has been carved with the names of all 32 women ordained at the 1994 service. One of them, Angela Berners-Wilson, said: “We were all asked to contribute to the original plaque and I think it was £15 each, which I happily did. But when we looked at it, it just had the bishop and the dean’s names on it. We are finally rectifying that 28 years later.” Berners-Wilson, who is is currently rector of the Quantock Towers Benefice in the diocese of Bath and Wells, described the previous male-only plaque as “very Church of England”. She added: “It is good that at last this will be rectified, so all our names will appear on the new plaque and there is a special service with a woman bishop which is wonderful. I’m looking forward to seeing some of my old friends.” Faull said: “There is a certain irony that it has taken us 28 years to unveil a plaque that mentions the names of those pioneering women ordained in Bristol Cathedral all those years ago. But I hope and pray that the progress that this represents will be a mark of wider progress in the standing of women in the church and indeed our reaching out to all marginalised or under-represented groups.” The new plaque was made by the stone carver Robyn Golden-Hann, who is also an ordained priest in the Church of England. A notice by Bristol Cathedral explained why the plaque was necessary. It said: “The reason that the original plaque is being replaced is that it did not mention any of the women who were ordained. Instead it mentioned the men that ordained them. The new plaque has the names of all those ordained on it.”",News/World news,Bristol Cathedral replaces men-only plaque remembering first female priests,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/bristol-cathedral-plaque-first-female-priests
3/6/2022,"In staging Zana Fraillon’s 2016 novel, York-based Pilot Theatre goes beyond its stated core aim, “to create a cultural space where young adults can encounter, express, and interrogate big ideas that are relevant to our lives right now”. Subhi (Yaamin Chowdhury) has experienced nothing beyond the immigration detention centre in Australia where he was born. Here he is trapped with his mother (Kiran L Dadlani) and older sister, Queenie (Siobhan Athwal); the family is Rohingya, fled from persecution. Jimmie (Mary Roubos) lives with her father and brother beyond the camp; her mother is dead. The two youngsters meet one night when Jimmie comes to discover whether local rumours about the fabulous privileges enjoyed by detainees are true. As the pair share their stories, Queenie and Somali refugee Eli (Elmi Rashid Elmi) take surreptitious photographs to send to the press in the hope that the unfolding story of appalling conditions within the camp will reach the outer world. It does, but not before vicious guard Beaver (Mackenzie Scott) has taken a terrible revenge. Presentationally, director Esther Richardson’s production is impressive. The stage picture powerfully counterpoints impressions of confinement and freedom: Miriam Nabarro’s set silhouettes space-enclosing wire fences against the seemingly endless, colour-washed horizons suggested by Ben Cowens’s lighting. Video projections illustrate tales being told (seascapes, skyscapes, the eponymous bird; realised by Daniel Denton and Maha Alomari). Puppets are laughter-raising (a toy duck) and terrifying (bird skull-wearing soldiers); masked characters bring to moving life the story-within-the-story, written by Jimmie’s late mother and read to the illiterate girl by Subhi. At times, S Shakthidharan’s adaptation feels shaky, more like a sequence of scenes than a fully developed drama. Ultimately, though, the writing, combined with committed performances from the cast, soul-shakingly communicates the truthfulness of the characters’ experiences. The message of Pilot’s production is not just for young adults but for all ages and all times.

3/6/2022,"Captain Ejnar Mikkelsen (co-writer Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) has decided to risk his life for a piece of paper. The year is 1909 and the bearded explorer is determined to retrieve a map that proves the territory of Greenland belongs to his native Denmark, and not America. The only problem is, he must cross thousands of miles of ice to get it. He needs a buddy; engineer Iver (Joe Cole) is the only one of his crew who volunteers to accompany him on a months-long journey that one lad describes as the equivalent of “walking from Moscow to Rome”. There is about as much jeopardy as you’d expect from an action thriller about an obscure land dispute; a tense encounter with an angry polar bear and a phantom hot air balloon are highlights during the endless plodding across the frozen wilderness.
