3/22/2022,"""Strategic"" and ""exemplary"" are hardly ever used to describe Russian President Vladmir Putin — unless we're talking about the Chinese internet. While Putin is met with condemnation from the West, he's winning wild cheers in China. Since Russia invaded Ukraine last month, China has broken away from other world powers and taken a comparatively pro-Putin stance on the war. Western nations such as the United States and Canada as well as private companies from McDonald's to Volkswagen have been quick to sever many financial ties to Russia that could aid its war effort. That's how China has become Russia's economic lifeline. The Chinese government has shown a general unwillingness to remove Chinese corporations from Russian soil, and Guo Shuqing, chair of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, has said Beijing won't help sanction Russia. China's state-controlled media has also been quick to embrace Russian propaganda, instilling a broad sense of pro-Putin sentiment among the Chinese people — and my Chinese family is no exception. Growing up in a multicultural household, it was easy to spot the ideological difference between my American parents and Chinese grandparents. My parents left China and my grandparents in the 2000s to emigrate to American. In the years since, like most other Americans, they've adopted a Western belief system, which now includes recognizing the harms of Russian aggression. But my relatives who remain in China have undergone no such shift, including in their stance on this war. A few weeks ago, my mother had a phone call with my grandma, who lives in a small rural town in eastern China. In just minutes, the call escalated from typical catching up to full-blown rebukes of each other's countries. I could hear my grandma throwing around hard-hitting phrases, like ""brainwashed by America"" and ""Joe Biden's fault."" ""Don't believe everything you read,"" my mom shot back. Neither my mother nor grandmother are irritable people, but I could see my mother's anger and hear the strain in my grandma's voice through the phone. What was more surprising, though, were the parallels between my grandma's words and the jargon used in Chinese state media. As anti-Western sentiment in China heightens, pro-Russian stories have boomed in Chinese cyberspace. Putin's declaration of war speech on Feb. 24 received an outpouring of Chinese praise, and state censors allowed pro-war posts to go viral. ""A comment widely circulated across various Chinese social media platforms in recent days depicts the Russia-Ukraine conflict as a romantic triangle,"" reports The Atlantic. ""Ukraine is characterized as Russia's ex-wife, who mistreated the couple's two children — the breakaway pro-Moscow regions of Luhansk and Donetsk — and who also flirted with the United States and dreamed of joining the NATO family but was rebuffed."" An article portrayed Russian aggression as a champion for combating NATO forces, adding that even discussing the war over dinner is remarkably satisfying. Users of Weibo, a Chinese analog to Twitter, praised Putin for doing a ""beautiful job"" fighting a necessary war. ""If I were Russian, Putin would be my faith, my light,"" said one Weibo post. Against all this, anti-war comments have received little traction in China, because they're quickly censored by the Chinese government. Chinese TV star Jin Xing had her Weibo account suspended after expressing contempt for the war, and most users are only seeing pro-Russia and pro-Putin content in their feeds. Inevitably, that propaganda affects how Chinese people think about the world. Recent conversations with my grandparents have consistently drifted into discussions about the war, and more often than not, we end the call with a deep sense of anger about each other's political opinions. Beyond all its other ills, beyond worsening U.S. and China relations, this war is hurting my relationship with my grandparents. We've argued over politics before, from 2018 trade war to American support of Taiwan, but this feels like a tipping point. Conversations with my relatives in China are increasingly, uncomfortably careful. We walk a fine line to avoid topics too taboo or controversial — and it's a line we have to walk because the Chinese government is lying to my family.

3/22/2022,"On a Wednesday night, about a hundred military spouses fill the hall at the Club Stewart meeting facility waiting anxiously for the town hall to start. Their husbands and wives, soldiers of the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team of Fort Stewart, recently deployed to Germany to reinforce NATO allies amid Russian attacks on Ukraine. For the crowd, made up mostly of women and their young children, the deployment is the closest to possible combat their partners have been, and they’re looking for answers and reassurance amidst an unfamiliar situation. “It’s completely new. We haven’t seen this kind of land warfare since World War II in Europe,” said Sgt. Maj. Michael A. Grinston. Grinston, the highest-ranking noncommissioned officer in the U.S. Army, doesn’t typically attend these town halls. His appearance underscores the current circumstances – that this deployment wasn’t a scheduled rotation but a response to a contingency and a gray area that the Army leadership is still figuring out themselves. While President Joe Biden has repeatedly said he will not send U.S. troops into Ukraine to engage with Russian forces, the situation is fluid, and the brigade has to train and “be ready for anything,” said Grinston. Previous Story: Second round of Fort Stewart troops disembark from Savannah, reinforce NATO allies Since Biden announced sending reinforcements to Europe almost a month ago, nearly 4,000 troops from the 3rd Infantry Division (the combined arms division based at Fort Stewart) have deployed from the Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah. They were part of more than 12,000 U.S. troops called on to bolster NATO’s eastern flank as Russian aggression has intensified the past several weeks. On March 2, the first round of about 3,800 soldiers from the 3rd ID left for Germany after cramming months of training into mere weeks, then bidding goodbyes to their families. A week later, an additional 130 troops from the 3rd ID’s Combat Sustainment Support Battalion followed suit, many of them young soldiers anticipating their first mission overseas. Before: 'Very hectic': US troops from Fort Stewart rushed to Europe on plane from Hunter Army Airfield The deployments, currently scheduled to last six months, could be extended or shortened depending on developments in Ukraine. “Morale is high … they’re extremely motivated,” said Grinston, who visited troops in Europe in early March. “But it’s hard to work in an ambiguous environment. I looked some of them in the eye and said, ‘You’ve got to be ready.'” The ambiguity of the mission was thrown into the light as Grinston fielded an array of questions from audience members for nearly two hours. Expecting mothers asked about paternity leave. Others wanted to know what financial compensations would be given – if hazard pay or other entitlements applied; if child care services would be offered in light of the rapid deployment and as effects of the pandemic linger; if the austere conditions their spouses were put in were normal; and what the worst-case scenario could be. “We’re kind of in this new space, where it’s not combat, but it's a deployment,” Grinston reminded everyone. Some concerns would be worked out at the base level. Each military family has a family care plan and Fort Stewart’s Army Community Service offers programs and family support. Other answers, such as those regarding entitlement pay and other family incentives, are contingent on the type of operation, which has yet to be named. The Army is three weeks into the mission so assessments are still being done, according to Grinston. Queries about the direction of the deployment were left open-ended. “I apologize if it felt like I was pushing back…,” said Grinston, who tried to keep the tone light throughout the evening with occasional banter. “I promise I’m going to look into every issue … I’ll take this to the whole department of the Army and they will help us answer your problems, but I have to know your problems.” With a situation like this, a massive cultural understanding takes place, according to a 3rd ID spokesperson. The town hall was ultimately a learning experience for everyone and a way for the Army to take a pulse on the families. “There was a lot of stress and part of the stress is because we told their spouses to 'Go right now,'” said Grinston, who noted some soldiers had returned just a few months ago from a scheduled rotation in South Korea. Leaving so quickly marked a historic moment for the division. Usually, shipping Bradley troop carriers and tanks to the deployment location is part of the process, but that wasn’t the case this time. “This is the first one I can remember where we said ‘we’re going to draw equipment from an APS (Army Prepositioned Stock)’,” said Grinston. The plan is for soldiers to train with the equipment from the prepositioned stock in Europe. “With this situation that we're in right now, I can't say, ‘this is exactly what we're going to do tomorrow.’ We don't know what the world's gonna look like,” said Grinston, “But these are our families. I have to hear that and come out with that frustration because then that motivates me. I really would’ve loved to have all the answers, but that’s just not how this works.” Nancy Guan is the general assignment reporter covering Chatham County municipalities.
