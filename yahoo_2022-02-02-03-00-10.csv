""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below."" Ever wonder how long you need to hold a plank to get results — without hanging out in the pose for a second longer than you need to? Us too. We’re going to get into the details (spoiler: there are a few factors to consider) but first: Here’s why you should work your core with the staple move in the first place. According to the American Council on Exercise (ACE), the core muscles include the erector spinae (or your back extensors), internal and external obliques (responsible for rotating your trunk), obliques (these help you bend to the side), transverse abdominis (this is the muscle being used when your bootcamp instructor enthusiastically belts out “draw your belly button into your spine!”), rectus abdominis (commonly referred to as your ""six-pack"" muscles), and the multifidi (which keeps your spine stable). And according to Annie Mulgrew, founding instructor for CITYROW in New York City and NASM-certified personal trainer, keeping those core muscles strong is essential to helping your body function properly. “Core strength provides stability, as well as balance, improves overall strength, and enhances a person’s ability to do everyday tasks,” she explains. “[When your core is strong], you move better, breathe better, and function at a higher level.” A 2019 PLOS ONE study, which focused on college-age endurance athletes, found that eight weeks of core training helped to improve runners' endurance and balance. Meanwhile, other studies have noted that regular core strengthening was a factor in reducing chronic back pain. Mulgrew adds: “The stronger your core, the less strain on [your] lower back, knees, and shoulders.” Whether you do planks, sit-ups, crunches, or some other move really comes down to whichever form of core-strengthening you like best (or, rather, can withstand!), according to Mulgrew. Still, planks are her favorite for a single, overarching reason: You get the most bang for your buck. “Planking is a more total-body exercise than a crunch, which focuses mostly on the rectus abdominis,” she explains. “Planking engages the arms, hips, glutes, legs, and upper back. It works those deep stabilizing muscles as it is an isometric exercise.” Sit-ups, on the other hand, engage corresponding muscles (hips, lower back) a bit more than crunches, but not as much as a plank would. Plus, if you have a previously existing lower back or neck injury, crunches and sit-ups can cause even more damage, whereas a plank can help strengthen those muscles without causing any extra strain. But, as Mulgrew reiterates, there is room for all types of abdominal-focused exercises. She adds that you’d compare a crunch or sit-up to a biceps curl (an isolated exercise) versus a plank to a squat or deadlift (a compound exercise). Ready to get started? Here’s how to tap into all those core-tastic strengthening and balancing benefits by executing the perfect plank: How to: Start on the floor on your hands and knees. Place your hands directly under your shoulders. Step your feet back, one at a time. For more stability, bring your feet wider than hip-distance apart, and bring them closer for more of a challenge. Maintain a straight line from heels through the top of your head, looking down at the floor, with your gaze slightly in front of you. Now, tighten your abs, quads, glutes, and hold. Here are some additional form tips from Mulgrew: Arms and legs should be perfectly extended. Shoulders should also be protracted, or pushed down to open up more space between your shoulder blades. Your tailbone reaches towards your inner heels. Abdominals should be fully engaged, as well as glutes and hips. The answer is not as simple as you think. Albert Matheny, R.D., C.S.C.S., co-founder of SoHo Strength Lab and advisor to Promix Nutrition, says you can plank daily, but the length of time you should hold a plank for can vary from 10 seconds to a minute. Here’s why: Your form matters most. “Keeping perfect form is the goal—only do it as long as you can keep this,” Matheny says. As a general guideline, Doug Sklar, a certified personal trainer and founder of PhilanthroFIT in New York City, recommends striving to do three sets of up to 60 seconds. “It’s OK to start with shorter sets and work up to 60 seconds,” he says. Plus, shorter planks can still give you a solid workout, Sklar says. He suggests holding a plank for 10 seconds, relaxing for five to 10 seconds, then re-engaging for 10 seconds, and repeating for three to six sets. “You receive very similar strengthening benefits because you are engaging your muscles for the same amount of total time as if you just held the plank for 30 to 60 seconds without stopping,” he says. That being said, a minute tends to be an ideal time frame for getting the most from a plank. “Longer time under tension is more of a challenge,” Matheny says. But, he adds, if you can easily plank for a minute, you increase the difficulty by contracting your abs more, and squeezing your glutes and quads more. Again, don’t push yourself to hold a plank for even longer if you’re not ready. “Forcing yourself to hold a plank for an excessive amount of time can put a lot of strain on your lower back,” Sklar says. “As fatigue sets in, the lower back may start to arch. This is where you put yourself at risk for injury.” (That’s where the 60-second reco comes into play!) So, plank when you can and do it as long as you can hold good form, for up to a minute. You should see great results. Although a plank is truly a gold-standard exercise when it comes to core strengthening and stabilizing (and perfectly fine to do as is!), you can increase the intensity of the move by adding in a few variations. Take a peek at these 10 plank variations to try, including hand taps, elbow taps, and other destabilizing moves that’ll cause your core to work overtime to keep you in a steady position.

2/2/2022,"⚡️ Read the full article on Motorious Early on the morning of January 13, three men showed up at Mathews Dodge with the intention of leaving with a Dodge Challenger Hellcat and Charger Hellcat sitting in the showroom. Instead of paying for the cars, the men stole them, something we see way too often these days. That kind of a heist in the city of Mount Vernon, Ohio is a big deal since it’s not exactly Chicago or Detroit. It also shows this problem of professional car theft rings is spreading to rural America. Check out a 39-car barn find here. As you would expect, there is surveillance footage of the heist, but it hasn’t been released to the public. Instead, we just know that the three suspects pulled up in a “silver SUV.” That’s right, no make, model, etc. We’d at least be curious if that SUV was a Mopar, because we’ve seen thieves stealing Dodges while using other Mopars to pull it off, which were probably stolen as well. The Knox County Sheriff’s Office did reveal other dealerships in nearby counties have been targeted lately. We’ve seen this increasing in many areas since criminals know likely nobody comes by the dealerships in the middle of the night, giving them plenty of time to grab brand new cars. Some news agencies have blamed the increase in car thefts solely on the pandemic. While that might be a factor, including the resulting increase in vehicle values, there are other things likely driving this behavior as well. Lax bail policies, toned-down prosecution, and the slashing of police department budgets certainly have contributed to criminals feeling they can act with impunity. With a population under 20,000 Mount Vernon isn’t exactly an epicenter of crime. That’s why the local sheriff’s office is studying the surveillance video and taking the investigation seriously. The last thing anyone wants is criminals deciding the area is a good place to steal more cars or commit other crimes. Sign up for the Motorious Newsletter.

2/2/2022,"Over a balmy winter weekend in South Miami-Dade, Florida, a young boy and his grandfather set out to fish along a canal. What they reeled in weren’t fish, but holy mackerel were they a catch. Duane Smith was shocked when his grandson Allen Cadwalader pulled in two .50-caliber Barrett sniper rifles while magnet fishing, the Miami Herald reported. Smith and Cadwalader went out with magnetic rods after viewing a YouTube video on it, and decided to drop lines in the C-102 canal. “We ended up with two pounds of scrap metal and 40 pounds of gun,” Smith told the Miami Herald, adding, “I figured, since it was our first time, this was beginner’s luck.” But luck struck twice, and the pair pulled up a second rifle one drop after the first. “The Barretts had so much mass,” Smith noted. “The magnet went straight to them.” Smith, 61, who formerly served with Army infantry, said that he was interested in the firearms’ lower recievers, where serial numbers are typically located. He immediately called police. “Whoever did this is not your run-of-the-mill criminal,” said Smith. “It looked like it was something that someone would want to come back for.” The guns are currently being processed at a local forensics lab. This was far from the first time people have gone “magnet fishing” and found old weapons. This YouTube video shows the discovery of an old Nazi MG-42 machine gun from World War II. “For me a very exciting video!” said MjrCarnyx - WW2 Metal Detecting, who posted the video, which had more than 280,000 views, in 2019. “As you can see we had a few epic days with the guys from Dutch WW2 Magnet Hunters. It was absolutely unbelievable and I can’t thank them enough for taking me along. I really do hope you enjoy!”",U.S./Air Force Times,Florida boy reels in .50-caliber Barrett sniper rifles while fishing,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-boy-reels-50-caliber-172431321.html
2/2/2022,"Democratic state Rep. Nicole Klein-Knight reportedly used the N-word multiple times to “make a point.” A state lawmaker in New Hampshire was removed from her committee assignments after an incident in which she repeatedly used a racial slur and called security on a young Black male organizer who had given testimony. Rep. Nicole Klein-Knight, a Democrat, was stripped of her assignment on the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee after a dozen minority activists wrote in a letter that her “habitual aggression and disregard is tearing apart the progressive community in New Hampshire and endangering BIPOC organizers’ lives and cannot be ignored any longer.” During the encounter, which took place last month, Klein-Knight reportedly used the N-word multiple times to “make a point.” She did not direct the word at the young man, but the organizers noted she continued to use it despite being asked to stop, and her use of the word was to intimidate. In the letter, they write, “when any individual who holds political power uses racist or bigoted language, we believe there is no room to ignore or give a pass. We will not remain silent when potential harm is being done to our community. While we believe in promoting growth and supporting each other in learning to do and be better, we also believe in accountability. When powerful people commit repeated offenses to marginalized Granite Staters, a line must be drawn to protect people and prevent instigating further harm or trauma.” According to a New Hampshire NPR report, Klein-Knight also called security on the young man, which the organizers believe could have endangered his life. Klein-Knight, who’s serving her second term representing Manchester, did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press, nor did the unidentified young Black man — who has since filed an ethics complaint with Statehouse staffers — according to one of the organizers who signed the letter, Alissandra Rodriguez-Murray. “Not only did she verbally abuse him, but the representative put this young man’s safety at risk in a situation she started, continued and escalated,” the activists’ letter states. Democratic leader Renny Cushing and Deputy Leader David Cote asked state Speaker of the House Sherman Packard to remove Klein-Knight from its Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, and he did so, confirmed late Monday. Cushing and Cote said later in a joint statement: “The behavior and language used by Rep. Klein-Knight is completely irreconcilable with legislating.” According to a local report, Klein-Knight has previously engaged in outlandish behavior, including “making a show of consuming medical marijuana gummies during a committee meeting on Zoom, and accusing GOP lawmakers, without proof, of infecting her with COVID.” The letter from the activists says Klein-Knight has “worked alongside many of us in the past, but unfortunately her behavior in the past few months has been alarming and has become increasingly dangerous.” Have you subscribed to the Grio podcasts “Dear Culture” or “Acting Up?” Download our newest episodes now!TheGrio is now on Apple TV, Amazon Fire, and Roku.
