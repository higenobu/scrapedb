2/17/2022,"Iran has reached a moment of truth and must decide in days, not weeks, whether to accept the text of a nuclear deal accepted by China, Russia, European powers and the US, the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, has said. His claim that the text was now agreed, not just between western powers, but also Russia and China, is designed to put maximum pressure on Iran to accept the attempt to revive its landmark nuclear deal, by which it agreed to limit nuclear activity in return for the lifting of some sanctions.  Tehran’s negotiators have been holding out in recent weeks for the wider lifting of US economic sanctions and some form of political statement by the US Congress that it will not walk away from the deal as it did in 2018, only three years after it came into force. “We have arrived at the hour of truth. It is not a question of weeks, it is a question of days. We have arrived at a point of sufficient convergence with the other countries, the accord is within reach,” Le Drian told the French Sénat on Wednesday. “They (Iran) have a very clear choice, either they unleash a serious crisis in the next few days … or they accept an agreement that respects the interests of all the parties.” Later on Wednesday, Iran’s lead negotiator tweeted: “After weeks of intensive talks, we are closer than ever to an agreement; nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, though. “Our negotiating partners need to be realistic, avoid intransigence and heed lessons of past 4yrs. Time for their serious decisions.” Earlier in the day, the Élysée issued a statement saying the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, had spoken by phone and agreed that, “Iran must fully comply with its nuclear responsibilities”. Wang Qun, the head of the Chinese delegation in Vienna, where the talks now in their eighth round have been taking place, told reporters: “We are in the final stages of negotiations. I hope that the [final] steps will be taken towards each other, because we are one step closer to the final agreement.” The Russian ambassador to the Vienna talks, Mikhail Ulyanov, simply said non-stop talks were under way. Neither ambassador’s remarks quite tallied with claims that Russia and China had endorsed the text of the accord, and the claims that the talks have only days left may be construed by Iran as another attempt to force them to accept the deal. But the Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, in an interview in the Financial Times, said the Iranian public could not simply accept a statement from the US president that he did not intend to leave the deal, something Joe Biden has already formally said. The 2015 deal began to unravel in 2018 when Donald Trump withdrew the US and reimposed sanctions on Iran, which then began breaching the accord’s limits on its uranium enrichment. Amir-Abdollahian said the US Congress and perhaps other parliaments should issue a political statement on Washington’s commitments to the UN security council and return to the nuclear deal. “At least their parliamentarians or their parliamentary speakers, including the US Congress, make a political statement announcing their commitment to the agreement and returning to implementation,” he said. Such a statement would not have any legal force, but has symbolic value for Iran as it tries to sell the deal internally. Resistance to the deal inside the US Republican party is, however, deep. Referring to the lifting of sanctions, Amir-Abdollahian said: “Iran wants these talks to lead to the complete lifting of sanctions.” But the Biden administration only wants to lift the economic sanctions that were “imposed” on Iran during the Trump era, calling the difference between the two sides “a challenge.”",News/World news,Tehran under pressure as Iran nuclear deal reaches crunch point,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/tehran-under-pressure-as-iran-nuclear-deal-reaches-crunch-point
2/17/2022,"The co-founder of the Eden Project has caused a stir by suggesting that Cornish people are not articulate and are overly fond of looking back to an imaginary “good old days”. Speaking on a podcast focusing on social issues in Cornwall, where the attraction is situated, Sir Tim Smit bemoaned the fact that people who spoke about the county were sometimes criticised as “arrogant” if they are not Cornish themselves.  Smit, who was born in the Netherlands and moved to Cornwall in 1987, said: “You feel, I don’t, but you feel like saying, well if you were a bit more fucking articulate you could speak up yourself but you haven’t.” He went on: “You’ve all got mums who made the best pasties in the world and it’s fantastic and it’s fabulous and you talk about the good old days and the good old days never were the good old days. “They’ve been bad for about 70 years and they’ve been bad because tossers like you and that’s what I would actually say to quite a lot of Cornish people. “I really would because you cannot define your life in terms of what you don’t like. You’ve got to actually define your life sometimes in terms of the sunny uplands you would like to aspire to.” Many people have expressed their anger on social media, with one critic asking why, if Cornwall was so bad, he came in the first place, another saying that an articulate person would not need to use bad language to get their point across. One person said: “Well he can leave anytime. Happy to take our money though isn’t he?” Another added: “His comments are hateful”, a third: “People like you will never understand Cornwall, and you’ll never be accepted.” Others said they were pleased at least that it had caused a debate. “I completely get what Tim Smit’s saying here and I also get how some Cornish people have reacted,” said one commentator. “At least it’s forced another conversation about the real Cornwall.” Seamas Carey, the performer and composer behind the podcast, told the Guardian: “I’m aware that [the] comments have ruffled the feathers of many people in (and out of) Cornwall. To my surprise, extracts of what Tim said were turned into a meme at surprising speed. He’s sparked debates in many households.” He said his The Reason Why podcast was meant to be a “balanced, nuanced piece of journalism about Cornwall”. Carey added: “With that in mind, I’m extremely grateful to Tim for giving me his time and opinions. I’m a big fan of empathy, so can see where Tim’s coming from whilst also understanding the anger that some listeners have voiced. “It’s good to remember that Tim’s made big things happen in Cornwall, of which many people have benefited from. He’s a canny businessman, with a confident style.” The Eden Project has been contacted for a comment.",News/UK news,Eden Project co-founder attacks backward-looking ‘tossers’ in Cornwall,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/16/eden-project-tim-smit-cornwall-attack
2/17/2022,"The decision to extend the offer of vaccination to younger children was reached after months of intense deliberation about the benefits and risks by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Finally, on Wednesday, the group’s recommendation that vaccination should go ahead for five- to 11-year-olds was made public. Surprisingly, given this was a long-awaited decision, there was no public briefing by the government. The short, neutral statement from Sajid Javid, the health secretary, that children in England would be eligible for vaccination from April “so that parents can, if they want, take up the offer” may have left some parents feeling confused or that the buck had simply been passed to them.  However, the JCVI makes clear that while the children are at very low risk from Covid-19, it recommends that vaccination goes ahead, and the reasoning behind its decision provides some useful guidance to parents. The main motivation is not to avoid school absences but to “future-proof” younger children against waves of infection that are predicted to occur later this year. The benefits and risks are finely balanced. The number of cases of very severe illness avoided will be small, and vaccine safety is well established at this point and side-effects tend to be mild. To give a sense of the numbers being considered, the JCVI estimates that in a future severe wave of Covid, vaccinating 1 million children with two doses each would avoid 58 hospitalisations and three ICU admissions. When the committee considered school absences, it found the impact of vaccination was “indeterminate” because side-effects from vaccination, though mild, might cause children to miss school. The JCVI recommends a “non-urgent” offer because the threat from Covid-19 is not the most pressing public health priority for this age group. It is crucial, for instance, that extending Covid vaccines does not disrupt childhood vaccination programmes such as MMR, which have fallen behind during the pandemic and tackle a more serious threat to the health of most young children. However, the government announcement may have left some parents wondering if the lack of urgency should be taken as a personal instruction – don’t worry about coming forward, it isn’t that important – or even reflect some degree of uncertainty about the decision. The JCVI has said parents should not be rushed into a decision, but the recommendation is that people come forward when a vaccine is offered. Given the fine balance, it is right that parents are free to choose whether to vaccinate their children against Covid-19, and experts have welcomed this move. Simon Williams, a senior lecturer in people and organisation at Swansea University, said: “I think leaving the decision to parents is a good idea. The important thing is that parents of younger children in the UK, like parents in many countries internationally, now have the choice. Ultimately, what most parents seem to have wanted is the choice to have or to not have the vaccine for their children.” In the absence of a formal recommendation from government, it is crucial that the science behind this policy is clearly communicated so that parents can, as they have been asked, come to their own informed decision.",News/Society,Vaccine offer lets parents weigh finely balanced benefits and risks,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/16/vaccine-offer-lets-parents-weigh-finely-balanced-benefits-and-risks
2/17/2022,"There’s a recurring impulse throughout Inventing Anna, the nine-part Netflix limited series on the so-called “Soho Grifter”, to apply the scam logic of Anna Delvey – a broke twentysomething Russian émigré who posed as a wealthy German heiress in mid-2010s New York – to society at large. Capitalism is a scam. So is meritocracy. Rich people can skate by on the assumption of their wealth; men fake it till they make it all the time. There’s a point to this, however blunt and flattening it’s made in connection to Anna Delvey. Part of our evergreen fascination with scams – an amorphous zeitgeist that includes everything from Fyre festival to the Tinder Swindler to upcoming series on Elizabeth Holmes and WeWork’s implosion – derives from recognition. They’re extreme versions of dynamics with which we’re all familiar: exploitation, manipulation of trust, seductive performance, inflation of the self.  Based-on-a-true-story television, like a scam, requires sustained disbelief; if done well, it’s a potent cocktail of truth and dramatic embellishment. There’s an implicit contract with the audience that some details will be juiced up, some facts changed. Inventing Anna, the first Netflix series created by Shonda Rhimes under her blockbuster deal with Netflix (2020 hit Bridgerton, produced by her company Shondaland, was created by Rhimes protege Chris Van Dusen), invokes this connection at the beginning of each episode with a cheeky reminder: “This whole story is completely true, except for all the parts that are totally made up.” This nod at Anna Delvey’s genuinely stupefying nerve – to fund her self-named arts club (the “new Soho House”), based entirely on lies and zero assets, she applied for a $40m loan (!!) – ends up being more revealing of the show itself. Its curious blurring of fact and fiction will lead many viewers to Google the real thing, and left me scratching my head. In a confounding choice, Inventing Anna buries its sharpest hook – the scammer and those who accommodated, even benefited from, her charades through New York – into the somewhat fictionalized story of how a journalist, Vivian Kent (Anna Chlumsky), pieces together her grift in an effort to rescue her career from a devastating journalistic mistake. It’s an attempted meditation on fact and fiction whose blurring of the two obscures the heady, perpetually compelling mix in the art of the scam – why someone lies, why people believe them, the heaps of denial and cognitive dissonance needed to sustain both. Like Nine Perfect Strangers, last year’s buzzy Hulu show with similarly flashy parts (Nicole Kidman in a wig, sinister wellness culture), Inventing Anna is at once overlong and underwhelming – a disappointing, intriguing misfire. You’d be hard pressed to find a show with more reliably interesting attention hooks than Inventing Anna. There’s the creator: Rhimes, the master of the modern soap opera, adapting a true story for the first time. There’s Julia Garner, the breakout star of Netflix’s Ozark, transforming into Anna – perpetual scowl, bracingly harsh accent from nowhere. And there’s the source material: the 2018 New York magazine article by Jessica Pressler, which quickly became one of the most-read of the year and a surefire bet in the by-then churning article-to-screen pipeline. (Pressler, whose work also inspired the film Hustlers, is a producer on the series.) Inventing Anna acknowledges the popularity of this story from the jump: the first shot is of magazines rolling off the press, the now canonical (to media people) lead image recreated with Garner. Anna gets the first word: “This whole story, the one you are about to sit on your fat ass and watch like a big lump of nothing, is about me,” she says. But it’s Vivian Kent, loosely based on Pressler, who tells the story. Each of the nine episodes focuses on someone tricked by Anna – her ex-boyfriend, the lawyer she retains for her club, her trainer, ex-best friend Rachel Deloache Williams, whom she stuck with a $62,000 bill in Morocco – as refracted through Vivian’s understanding of Anna and her personal motivations to nail the story. The framing of the Anna Delvey story, which in the show is peppered with identifying details, characterizations and real names, through a fictional-ish journalist is questionable, distracting. When most of the other characters have real counterparts, and the details of the story are well known, why invent a journalist character? And why make the journalist bad at her job and borderline unethical? (Vivian, who in the show appears to view Anna as somewhat of a feminist antihero, lies to her boss, ignores assignments, and most egregiously, offers to help the defense team.) It feels problematic to adjust the journalist character with some elements of Pressler’s story – Pressler was also pregnant when reporting the piece, and was also the author of a retracted story, though the mistake didn’t hang over her career as it does Vivian’s – but then keep Williams’s characteristics consistent. Inventing Anna’s Williams, who wrote a first-person account (and later book) about getting stuck with the Morocco bill, has the same name, university, job, hair and words in Vanity Fair as the real Williams, whom the show paints as a self-victimizing, opportunistic hanger-on who profited off Anna’s story. (Maybe that’s true! But didn’t everyone?) While depictions of those in her orbit invite questions of accuracy and motivation, Anna herself is kept at an icy remove throughout. Garner’s Anna is deliberately abrasive, a cipher brimming with delusional ambition and uncomfortably guileless hustle. The show, via Vivian’s frustrated bafflement, gestures often at the sheer boldness of Delvey’s schemes – she didn’t have to apply for a $40m loan! She didn’t have to make the new Soho House! But it fails to capture the labyrinth of emotions undergirding the scam – why people cling to disproven trust, or how deeply Anna believed her own lies, what writer Brandon Taylor calls the “heady, thrilling feeling of getting away with something or the glazed pleasure of believing your own hype”. Instead, there’s a middling simulacrum of wealthy New York, heavy-handed writing, lots of wide-eyed gesticulation by Vivian, and the bait-and-switch of a journalism plot over Anna’s manipulations. Inventing Anna is simultaneously too interested in an inscrutable, wildly mercurial scammer – at the expense of her friends, associates, even her lawyer’s confounding, fascinating loyalty to her – and not interested enough in her appeal beyond money. The dramatization of facts and stories already in print makes for a good idea – it’s wild material – but this blend distracts more than informs, a skim of the familiar with little payoff.",Arts/Television & radio,Cheating the audience: what went wrong with Inventing Anna?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/16/inventing-anna-netflix-review
2/17/2022,"The Prince of Wales is facing the prospect of being interviewed by police as a witness after Scotland Yard launched an investigation into an alleged cash-for-honours scandal. The Prince’s Foundation, Charles’s charitable body, is at the heart of a criminal inquiry into allegations that a Saudi donor was offered help in securing a knighthood.  The announcement marked further turmoil for the royal family, coming a day after Charles’s brother, the Duke of York, reached an out-of-court settlement with a woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her when she was 17, which he denies. Last year the Prince’s Foundation ordered an independent investigation, which found that Charles’s former closest aide, Michael Fawcett, coordinated with “fixers” in a bid to secure the honour. The charity said Fawcett supported and would assist the investigation. The anti-monarchy pressure group Republic contacted the Metropolitan police in September and reported Charles and Fawcett in the wake of media coverage of the claims. The former Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker also asked the force to probe the allegations against Fawcett. On Wednesday, the Met said it had received a letter in September relating to the press reports and after further inquiries launched an investigation into allegations of offences under the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925. There have been no arrests or interviews under caution, the force added. Clarence House reiterated its previous statement, saying: “The Prince of Wales had no knowledge of the alleged offer of honours or British citizenship on the basis of donation to his charities.” A spokesperson for the Prince’s Foundation said: “It would be inappropriate to comment on an ongoing investigation.” Now the Met has launched an investigation, questions have been raised as to whether the heir to the throne may be interviewed by police. He is president of the foundation but not involved with its governance, with the charity’s trustees overseeing day-to-day activities. Graham Smith, the chief executive of Republic, said: “I think we want to know that Prince Charles himself will be investigated along with Michael Fawcett. So we hope the investigation will be carried out without fear or favour and will as be thorough as it needs to be.” A former Scotland Yard assistant commissioner, Robert Quick, said detectives would weigh up carefully whether they need to speak to Charles, almost certainly as a witness. Quick, who was head of specialist operations, including counter-terrorism and royalty protection, said: “If it is obvious he is not involved in any way, then there is no need. If he may have pertinent information, then he may be spoken to.” Peter Hunt, a former BBC royal correspondent, added: “This has the potential to be very challenging for Prince Charles. For decades, Michael Fawcett was one of his most powerful confidants. If their investigation is to be credible, the Met police will have to interview the future king in the same way they would any other citizen.” But Mark Stephens, an international reputation lawyer from the law firm Howard Kennedy, said he thought it highly unlikely that the prince would face a police interview. He said: “Charles has an entire staff who runs his office and he’s only told about the intimate dealings when he needs to know about them, and he clearly wouldn’t have needed to know about this.” Fawcett, who resigned as chief executive of the Prince’s Foundation in the wake of the scandal, was accused of promising to help secure a knighthood and British citizenship for Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, a Saudi billionaire charity donor and businessman. Last year, the Mail on Sunday published a 2017 letter in which Fawcett allegedly wrote that he was willing to make an application to change Mahfouz’s honorary CBE to a knighthood and support his application for British citizenship. The letter, written on headed notepaper in Fawcett’s capacity as chief executive of the Dumfries House Trust, said the applications would be made in response to “the most recent and anticipated support” of the trust. Mahfouz, who is listed as a supporter on the Prince’s Foundation website, is reported to have donated large sums to restoration projects of particular interest to Charles. He denies any wrongdoing. The Prince’s Foundation commissioned an independent investigation into the allegations, which found evidence of Fawcett’s “communications and co-ordination” with “so-called ‘fixers’ regarding honorary nominations for a donor between 2014-18”. This has the potential to be very challenging for Prince Charles. For decades, Michael Fawcett was one of his most powerful confidantes. If their investigation is to be credible, the Met police will have to interview the future king in the same way they would any other citizen. https://t.co/cBu1VWHntW On Wednesday Scotland Yard said: “The Special Enquiry Team has conducted the assessment process which has included contacting those believed to hold relevant information. Officers liaised with the Prince’s Foundation about the findings of an independent investigation into fundraising practices. The foundation provided a number of relevant documents. “These documents were reviewed alongside existing information. The assessment determined an investigation will commence. There have been no arrests or interviews under caution.”",News/UK news,Prince Charles could be called as witness in cash-for-honours investigation,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/16/prince-charles-could-be-called-as-witness-in-cash-for-honours-investigation
2/17/2022,"Babies whose mothers get vaccinated against Covid-19 during pregnancy are less likely to be admitted to hospital for the disease after they are born, a study suggests. The new findings are the first real-world evidence that pregnant women can not only protect themselves by getting vaccinated but can also protect their newborn infants.  Babies of mothers who had two doses of the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines while pregnant had a much lower risk of being hospitalised with Covid-19 in the first six months of their lives, according to the study from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “The data CDC is publishing today provides real-world evidence that getting a Covid-19 vaccine during pregnancy might help protect infants less than six months of age from hospitalisation due to Covid-19,” Dr Dana Meaney-Delman, the CDC’s chief of infant outcomes monitoring research and prevention branch, told a press briefing. This is likely because they are born carrying their mother’s antibodies, she said. “When people receive an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine during pregnancy, their bodies build antibodies to protect against Covid-19 and these antibodies have been found in umbilical cord blood, indicating that the antibodies have transferred from the pregnant person to the developing infant. And while we know that these antibodies cross the placenta, until this study, we have not yet had data to demonstrate whether these antibodies might provide protection for the baby against Covid-19.” Researchers from paediatric hospitals and the CDC looked at children under six months old between July 2021 and January 2022. The study analysed data from 379 hospitalised babies – 176 with Covid-19 and 203 who were admitted for other issues. It found that Covid-19 vaccines were 61% effective overall at preventing hospitalisations in children whose mothers were vaccinated during pregnancy. That protection rose to 80% when the mothers were vaccinated after 21 weeks to 14 days before delivery. Vaccination effectiveness fell to 32% for the babies whose mothers were inoculated earlier during their pregnancy. The study did not include data on vaccine effectiveness of booster jabs, or on mothers who were vaccinated before pregnancy. “The study found that Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy was 61% protective,” said Meaney-Delman. “Meaning that babies less than six months old, whose mothers were vaccinated, were 61% less like to be hospitalised with Covid-19. And in fact, the majority of babies, actually 84% who were hospitalised with Covid-19, were born to people who were not vaccinated during pregnancy. “Most concerning, they found that among babies with Covid-19, who were admitted to the ICU, the sickest babies, 88% were born to mothers who were not vaccinated before or during pregnancy. And the one baby who died in the study was born to a mother who was not vaccinated. The bottom line is that maternal vaccination is a really important way to help protect these young infants.” The study’s authors warned that the estimates for effectiveness earlier in pregnancy should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size. Pregnant women are at increased risk for severe illness from Covid-19, and having Covid during pregnancy can increase the risk of preterm birth, stillbirth and possibly other pregnancy complications. Health experts recommend that women who are pregnant, are breastfeeding, are trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future get vaccinated and stay up to date with Covid-19 jabs.",News/World news,Pregnant mother’s vaccination protects baby from Covid – study ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/covid-pregnant-mothers-mrna-vaccination-protects-baby-study

The Ukraine crisis is developing as Nato contradicts Putin’s claim of a troop drawdown, Australian economists warn of vastly unequal tax outcomes and Sydney’s first fatal shark attack in nearly 60 years has left the city’s beaches closed. Tax cuts planned to take effect in 2024-25 would pay male beneficiaries twice as much as women, separate analyses by the Australia Institute, the Greens and the Australian Council of Social Service have found. “Men in the top 10% of taxpayers [would] get almost 40% of the tax cut,” the Australia Institute said, with a parliamentary budget office report also suggesting the top 1% of earners would receive $11.8bn back, compared with $12.7bn for the lowest 60% of earners. The treasurer Josh Frydenberg’s office released “unpublished” data this month that said 5.2 million women had benefited from $14.4bn in tax relief across the past two and a half years.  Nato’s secretary general has contradicted Vladimir Putin’s claim of a “partial” withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine’s border, saying the Kremlin “maintains a massive invasion force” that continues to represent “the biggest concentration of forces in Europe since the cold war.” Jens Stoltenberg, the former prime minister of Norway, also suggested Nato might deploy further battle groups across eastern and central Europe, depending on military advice.

2/17/2022,"The size of Prince Andrew’s settlement with Virginia Giuffre may be undisclosed but lawyers say it is certain to run into the millions, with estimates ranging from £5m to £14m. Such eye-watering figures have prompted calls for the source of the funds to be made public amid suggestions that the Queen will have to bail out her son.  Andrew is known to be trying to sell his £17m ski chalet in Verbier, Switzerland, but it is understood to be heavily mortgaged and the net proceeds are unlikely to cover the cost of the settlement. Andrew’s only publicly known regular income was a £249,000-a-year allowance from the Queen to fund his Buckingham Palace office while undertaking royal duties. He would also have a small pension from his time serving with the Royal Navy, a job he left in 2001. Now, with no royal duties to perform, it is not known what, if anything, he receives from his mother. Sunninghill Park, Andrew’s former marital home in Windsor, was bought in 2007 by Timor Kulibayev, the son-in-law of the president of Kazakhstan, for £15m – £3m more than the asking price. Since 2004, Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, have lived together at Royal Lodge, a Grade II-listed house in Windsor Great Park that is a former residence of the Queen Mother. A spokesman for Kulibayev said it was a “commercial, arm’s length transaction” using “entirely legitimate” funds. David McClure, the author of The Queen’s True Worth: Unravelling the public and private finances of Queen Elizabeth II, said Andrew did not have sufficient resources for the settlement and would have to turn to his mother for help, though favours from wealthy friends should not be ruled out either. “The very fact he’s down to selling the chalet does indicate that he’s not mega wealthy. He wouldn’t be selling it if he was mega wealthy,” McClure said. “[As for] other sources of revenue – more than likely he’s got his own portfolio of private shares. Given his lifestyle, given the financiers he mixes with, it would be amazing if he didn’t have his own portfolio of shares.” If the Queen is pitching in to help her son, it would not be the first time: she reportedly helped Prince Charles with his £17m divorce settlement with Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997. The Queen’s main source of funding is revenue from her semi-private estate, the Duchy of Lancaster, which brought her £23m last year and about £20m annually in previous years. “It is her cash cow,” McClure said. “She uses it for private income, she’s 95, so I don’t think she’s short of a bob or two.” He said this would be a good use of the money “to stop all the reputational damage that the Giuffre case threatened to bring if it had gone to court in the US. Of course it’s a bad case insofar that somewhere along the line the Queen might have to fork out X million, but that’s far better than having all the reputational damage that could come from a year-long drib and drab of damaging information about the royal family, and specifically about Andrew.” Stephen Bates, the author of Royalty Inc: Britain’s Best Known Brand, said: “He doesn’t have huge resources, he’s pretty dependent on his mum … if the sum is £10m to £12m there won’t be enough to meet it. Because he was perennially hard up, he certainly doesn’t have the money to pay it out of his bank account. “One of the reason he was hanging around unsavoury characters like [Jeffrey] Epstein and [Ghislaine] Maxwell was because he’s always been attracted to the lifestyle of people wealthier than he is. That was obviously his downfall in this case.” Bates said it was unlikely Andrew could turn to his ex-wife for help. “Sarah has been perennially short of money, which is why she’s got into all sorts of scrapes, so she’s not in a position, even if she wanted to, to find that sort of money,” he said. “But they do have rich friends. The question is how salubrious some of those friends are.” Another royal expert said it was likely the public would never know what contribution, if any, came from the Queen. Joe Little, the managing editor of Majesty magazine, said: “If we are clear that it is coming from a private source, albeit the Queen, then it’s no burden to the taxpayer. I think perhaps that needs to be underlined. “The figures are pretty transparent nowadays. The Queen has a private income which she uses to support various members of her family, so if that’s the case then so be it. Who else is going to support him other than the Queen?” Wherever the cash comes from, McClure was adamant the source and value should be made public. “There’s so much public interest round the world, it’s a major story, Andrew is a public figure – you may argue as of last month he’s been stripped of his titles, but he’s still linked to the palace. “It’s totally legitimate that the palace and its lawyers or the American lawyers give some indication as to the size of the cash settlement.”",News/UK news,‘Hard up’ Andrew may turn to family and friends to help pay settlement,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/16/hard-up-andrew-may-turn-to-family-and-friends-to-help-pay-settlement
2/17/2022,"Children aged five to 11 in England, Wales and Scotland will be offered protection against Covid, meaning millions more will be eligible for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The Pfizer vaccine, given at one-third the dose of adults, was approved as safe and effective for children by the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in December. But the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation previously recommended the vaccine only for vulnerable five- to 11-year-olds.  Millions of children aged five to 11 have been vaccinated in other countries, such as the US and countries in Europe. Five parents share their reactions. We’ll get it as soon as my daughter gets the opportunity to be vaccinated. She’ll be quite happy about it after catching the virus twice. My five-year-old daughter got Covid the first time in August. We hadn’t seen my dad and my family, since Covid started, for over a year. She felt really bad, saying “Now I can’t see grandad”. The second time, at the end of November, there was a massive outbreak and they had to close the school. We live in a village. It’s very isolating for these kids who are just building their social skills. We felt the worst thing about the pandemic was the loss of a normal childhood. I’m glad about the decision, but I don’t understand why it took so long, as we were the first country to approve the vaccine. Much fanfare was made of that, but we’ve slipped behind everybody else. Loretta Maddox, 47, PhD researcher, Brecon Beacons, Wales I’ll be getting the vaccine as soon as possible for my nine-year-old. She got Covid at Christmas after spending a few weeks with school friends, all getting positive results. We live in London, so it was everywhere at that time. You knew it was inevitable. I had hoped that the vaccine programme would have started before she got it, but one child fell sick after another. We were worried because our eldest child, who is 11, has a pre-existing health condition and our nine-year-old has asthma. They were poorly and had temperatures, but luckily they don’t seem to have any long-term symptoms. Our 11-year-old has now had the vaccine and we’d like to give our nine-year-old the best chance of not getting long Covid. The Omicron variant has been mild, but we don’t know if other variants will go on to affect children in more dangerous ways. Maybe it will be suitable for my three-year-old at some point, but we’ll wait and see if that’s needed. Laura Seabright, 44, secondary school teacher, London During the early pandemic, I wasn’t sure about giving it to my children, now aged seven and 10. My slight hesitation at the time was around long-term health consequences of being vaccinated – if there was something it kicked off in your body that was not understood. Really, it was fear of the unknown and of the untested. My 10-year-old son caught Covid in November from school and is still suffering the long-term consequences. He’s gone from being a bright, engaged, academic, sporty kid with more energy than anybody, to a short walk being impossible. On his worst days, he’d get dressed and bring his pyjamas downstairs for the evening so he wouldn’t have to go upstairs to collect them. Now that most of the developed world has done it, I would without hesitation get my children vaccinated. I’m actually just angry it wasn’t available earlier. It’s quite sad that it’s been available, but not to our children – their futures have been taken for a gamble. Janine Ainscow, 45, Leicestershire If there are clear and worthwhile benefits to vaccinating five to 11-year-olds, I don’t feel these have been communicated effectively, and as the father of a healthy six-year-old girl, I feel anxious about making this decision. From all the information that’s currently available, the risk to children of severe illness and death from Covid appears to be vanishingly small. We now know that although vaccines are crucial for protecting the lives of elderly and immunocompromised people, the benefits for the wider population are relatively short-lived, and its ability to prevent the spread of infection limited. In this context it’s difficult to understand what the impetus is for focusing energies on healthy children. Wouldn’t it be much better to redouble efforts toward the unvaccinated vulnerable and elderly categories? George, 38, small business owner, London I’m really joyful for children; every child deserves this protection. I’m thrilled that England has decided to move forward and do what everyone else was doing. I’m from Boston and have lived here for eight years, and all my American friends have been quite shocked and in huge disbelief that we couldn’t get the kids vaccinated here. After my husband’s office said he’d need to come back in later this month, we took our five- and seven-year-old over to Ireland to get vaccinated. We just called up and they said we could get it. Luckily, RyanAir flights are very inexpensive – now hopefully for the second jab we won’t have to travel. There are lots of motivations. My infant can’t get vaxxed, and I wanted to protect her; babies don’t have developed immune systems. I’m also concerned about long Covid for my children. Hopefully now this means we can go back to the US and visit their grandparents without bringing a disease from the UK.
