2/4/2022,"A hugely difficult week for Manchester United ends with them facing one of the form teams in the Championship. Chris Wilder, the Boro manager, has banned his players from swapping shirts with Cristiano Ronaldo, remarking they are not on a “sight-seeing tour”. His last visit to Old Trafford came with Sheffield United, their 2-1 win a rare highlight in a doomed final season, and Wilder has always had a taste for tweaking the nose of the gilded elite. Talking of which, Paul Pogba is fit enough for selection by Ralf Rangnick. Can Rangnick find Pogba a settled role in the team where José Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjær failed? Or, with the Frenchman’s contract ticking down towards a free transfer, will the interim manager even try? “He might even be in the starting XI,” Rangnick said on Thursday, though Pogba would not seem an ideal fit for Rangnick’s prescribed style. JB  Manchester United v Middlesbrough, Friday 8pm (all times GMT) It was after last season’s fourth-round tie that Chelsea sacked Frank Lampard, despite beating Luton 3-1 with a Tammy Abraham hat-trick. Mason Mount was handed the armband that day, a pointed gesture from a manager knowing his likely fate. Now for the visit of Plymouth Argyle. On Thursday, Pilgrims manager Steven Schumacher, a one-time Everton youth-team colleague of Wayne Rooney, said: “I’m sure the lads will find the energy from somewhere to go away to Stamford Bridge.” His team have endured long recent trips to Fleetwood and Doncaster, while many Chelsea players have enjoyed a rest in the international window; Schumacher called that a “winter break”. Plymouth, seventh in League One, hope to emulate Bradford in 2015 and pull-off a famous FA Cup shock at Stamford Bridge. Perhaps Jordan Houghton, a former Chelsea youngster, can repeat the role of Filipe Morais, a goalscorer that day against his old club. JB Chelsea v Plymouth Argyle, Saturday 12.30pm There’s a scene in the 1994 documentary, “Inside Story – the Manageress” where a 24-year-old Karren Brady, then managing director of Birmingham City, jokes down the phone with club owner David Sullivan at the prospect of facing Kidderminster Harriers in the FA Cup third round: “If they beat us, we will pack it in.” Naturally, the non-league Harriers famously ran out 2-1 winners over second-tier City. Kidderminster beat a Preston side containing David Moyes in the fourth round, only to controversially lose to West Ham in the fifth round. Brady and Sullivan stayed on at Birmingham, of course, despite the third-round embarrassment. Now vice-chairman and joint chairman of West Ham respectively, they will surely have winced at the draw this time around, even if Kidderminster are the lowest-ranked side left in the draw. The National League North side put Reading out in the last round at Aggborough – Moyes will surely not be taking them lightly. MB Kidderminster v West Ham, Saturday 12.30pm Frank Lampard has arrived as the new Everton manager and will be looking to make an immediate impact, and prove the doubters wrong after a year out of work following his Chelsea sacking last January. At Stamford Bridge, his teams often looked disorganised, quickening his downfall. If he can bring the discipline that was unexpectedly lacking under his Everton predecessor, Rafa Benítez, it will be a positive start for a team that consistently concedes from set-pieces. Centre-back Michael Keane has suffered all season and was left out by Duncan Ferguson for the loss to Aston Villa. He will need his confidence rebuilding by the new Goodison Park regime. Yerry Mina, Mason Holgate and Ben Godfrey are the other options at centre-back and it will be important to select the right pairing for the long-term, in order to build a base to the newly-formed spine of his team. WU Everton v Brentford, Saturday 3pm Cambridge’s reward for eliminating Newcastle in the third round was winning hearts and minds, rather than a lucrative away tie at a Premier League giant. Instead, the mid-table League One side have drawn Luton at home, and in the words of full-back George Williams, it feels like a “free hit”, though it will for both teams. Nathan Jones’s Luton side are within reach of a Championship playoff place, having picked 17 points in their last eight matches. That momentum began after almost a month of Covid cancellations when they crushed Harrogate in the third round. The Hatters beat Swansea in midweek and host Barnsley on Tuesday, so Jones may rest players. Their hosts welcome the BBC’s live cameras for the first time since 2015, when the U’s held Manchester United in a memorable Friday night encounter. JB Cambridge v Luton, Saturday 5.30pm Premier League leaders Manchester City face their Championship equivalents at the Etihad. Both teams are scoring at will: City have 55 goals in the league already this season but that is eclipsed by Fulham’s 74. Aleksandar Mitrovic is a key reason behind the net-bulging at Craven Cottage, thanks to his 28 goals in 26 league games. The Serb striker has rarely convinced as a top-flight player since arriving at Newcastle in 2015 but will be relishing the prospect of threatening the City centre-backs to help prove he can shine against the best, especially with a potential promotion on the line at the end of the season. Mitrovic’s best top-flight return was 11 goals with Fulham in 2018-18. It is a respectable figure but Mitrovic will feel he can do more, starting on Saturday. WU Manchester City v Fulham, Saturday 3pm Spurs’ FA Cup tie against Brighton will likely come too soon for Antonio Conte’s new signings, Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur, with the latter only meeting his new teammates for the first time on Thursday following the approval of his work permit. That means potential opportunities for Oliver Skipp, Harry Winks and Pierre-Emile Højbjerg to show that they merit a place in Conte’s new-look midfield. With games in hand on the teams above them and a top-four finish still very much a possibility, some managers might choose to protect their players in the Cup. Having not played a game for nearly two weeks, Conte would be foolish to rest any of his strongest XI here though , especially after the scare at home to Morecambe in the last round. Skipp, Winks and Hojbjerg will surely be eager to show they are not as disposable as the departed Giovani Lo Celso, Dele Alli and Tanguy Ndombele come the end of the campaign. MB Tottenham v Brighton, Saturday, 8pm Arsenal found out about the double threat of Nottingham Forest’s Djed Spence and Brennan Johnson to their cost in the third round. They will once again be key to Forest’s chances of success against East Midlands rivals Leicester. The pair have seemingly synchronised down the right flank to terrorise left-backs. Luke Thomas is the current incumbent at Leicester, having started the last two games following Timothy Castagne’s injury. The 20-year-old has impressed when called upon this season but Forest will be confident of causing problems against an inexperienced defender who will need cover from the winger in front of him. Spence and Johnson have been the subject of offers from Premier League clubs in January and will be more than happy to show prospective buyers they are worth another bid in the summer. WU Nottingham Forest v Leicester, Sunday 4pm Cardiff travel to Anfield on Sunday in a repeat of the 2012 League Cup final, in which Liverpool ran out winners at Wembley after a penalty shootout. Things should not be so close this time around, especially with Cardiff losing their attacking talisman, Kieffer Moore, to Bournemouth on transfer deadline day. City also lost Ryan Giles, recalled by parent club Wolves and now on loan at Blackburn – only two players in the Championship have more assists than the 22-year-old. Jordan Hugill has been added to the Bluebirds front line but this feels like a tough ask for Steve Morison, who has already admitted he will make changes from the side that beat Barnsley on Wednesday. For Liverpool, this might be an opportunity to rest key players before a tricky Premier League test against Leicester in midweek. MB Liverpool v Cardiff, Sunday 12pm It’s been quite the journey for Adrian Clifton. After serving three prison sentences as a youth, the striker has played for nine clubs, but is now a towering presence up top for Boreham Wood. The boyhood Arsenal fan scored with his third touch to seal a shock third-round win over AFC Wimbledon – celebrating with a textbook Thierry Henry knee slide. Boreham Wood have yet to lose at home this season and were disappointed by the draw away at Bournemouth. It is a bad combination: not exactly a big day out (the 11,329-capacity Vitality Stadium is smaller than some National League grounds) but also a meeting with an excellent side boosted by a string of high-profile January signings. The Cherries are pushing for promotion to the Premier League but will be wary of being turned over by unfancied opponents.

2/4/2022,"Peter Dutton has said there is an “enormous amount” more the government wants to do in order to relieve the workforce crisis in the aged care sector – including possibly sending in the Australian Defence Force. The defence minister said on Friday “of course” the government had to consider that option and “if that’s what’s required, that’s what we will do”.  The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has never ruled out using the ADF in aged care but he poured cold water on the idea in mid-January Mike Baird, the former New South Wales premier and now chief executive of aged care provider HammondCare, has said troops were required because the sector was facing a “perfect storm” of rising infections and staff shortages triggered by isolation requirements. On 13 January, Morrison told reporters in Canberra while he didn’t rule the idea out he wanted to “dispel this notion that the defence forces can come in and replace workforces all across the country, whether it be in aged care” or other sectors. Morrison said the ADF could “provide very important support” including “specialist knowledge and skills” but warned “that of itself is not going to solve that issue”. “What’s going to solve that issue, increasingly is a pushing through, ensuring that we can get as many of those staff not isolated and back working in aged care facilities as quickly as possible, and to ensure that we manage all the other demands in aged care facilities as best as we possibly can with rapid antigen testing and so on,” the prime minister said. Aged care providers estimate about a quarter of all shifts – or the equivalent of 140,000 shifts a week – are going unfilled while the disability sector has reported roster vacancies of up to 30% during the peak of Omicron. On Friday, Dutton said that aged and disability care were “obviously the most difficult” sectors because Covid-19 “deliberately targets older people” and those with underlying medical conditions. “The government has provided support with the industry. We’re already in an agreement with the private hospitals to supplement, so far, 78,000 shifts within aged care and JJ Frewen, the general who has orchestrated the rollout of the vaccine across the country, is intimately involved in the logistics and the rollout of the vaccine within the facilities,” the minister said. “So, yes, there’s an enormous amount more we want to do.” Dutton said the problem of Omicron in aged care was a “witches brew” because “people feel isolated and you want to allow loved ones in” but the government had to be “realistic about the fact that then introduces more of the virus into an aged care setting”. Asked if use of the ADF was something that needed to be considered, and quickly, Dutton replied: “Of course it is … If that’s what’s required, that’s what we will do.” Dutton said the best thing the government could do was “provide those nurses and those additional shifts to be covered where people are sick” – an ambiguous reference either to the surge workforce or the ADF. The government has offered two payments of up to $400 to workers in the aged care sector to help with staff retention, but unions and providers have blasted the Coalition for failing to make a submission in a work value case seeking pay rises of up to 25% in the sector, a more permanent solution to understaffing. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said on Friday the government “should put in a submission supporting a wage increase”. “If we don’t deal with the issue of wages, then we won’t be able to retain a workforce in the aged care sector,” he told ABC TV. “The other thing we need, of course, is we need more workers and more carers. But we need a nurse in every nursing home, 24/7. It’s extraordinary that we have these aged care facilities that can go for considerable periods of time without having a nurse right there when they’re needed.” Albanese repeated his call for the aged care services minister, Richard Colbeck, to resign, saying he had “failed before” and “continues to fail”. Guardian Australia last week revealed Colbeck attended the Hobart Test from 14 to 16 January after declining to attend the Covid committee on Friday 14 January – citing the workload of officials battling the Omicron wave. On Wednesday, Colbeck defended the decision and said the aged care sector was performing “extremely well” despite coming under “genuine stress” due to coronavirus. Australian Defence Force staff helped at aged care facilities in Melbourne in mid-2020 during Victoria’s Covid wave.",News/Australia news,Peter Dutton says if troops are needed to staff aged care homes ‘that’s what we will do’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/04/peter-dutton-says-if-troops-are-needed-to-staff-aged-care-homes-thats-what-we-will-do
2/4/2022,"Motorists will have to pay by the mile to make up a £35bn tax shortfall that will arise from the shift to electric vehicles, MPs have warned, calling on the government to act urgently to bring in a national road pricing scheme. The cross-party Commons transport select committee said it saw “no viable alternative” to road pricing and work should start immediately on creating a replacement for fuel duty before it dwindled away with the transition.  Without urgent reform of motoring taxation, the UK would face an under-resourced and congested future, the committee said. New petrol and diesel vehicles will be banned from sale from 2030, as part of the governments 2050 net zero plans, losing the Treasury roughly £28bn in fuel duty and £7bn in vehicle excise duty, under current tax rules. With the exception of the Green party, few have consistently called for road pricing, after an attempt in 2007 by Labour to implement a scheme met with an enormous public backlash. The mayor of London,Sadiq Khan, last month said the capital should move to a smart road pricing scheme but claimed the technology was not ready to introduce it before the end of his current term in office. Recognising the political difficulty, in its report published on Friday, the committee said new charges should entirely replace fuel duty and vehicle excise duty and be “revenue neutral”, with most motorists paying the same or less than they do now. The MPs said the government should consider the impact on vulnerable groups and those in rural areas, and ensure that any data captured be subject to “rigorous governance and oversight” to protect privacy. It should also incentivise people to continue to use public transport, walk or cycle, the committee said, with driving set to become an ever cheaper option once an electric vehicle is bought. Drivers of electric vehicles should pay to maintain and use the roads, the MPs said, like petrol and diesel drivers do – although incentives to purchase cleaner vehicles must remain. The report calls on the Treasury and Department for Transport to set up an arm’s length body to draw up a scheme by the end of 2022. Committee chair Huw Merriman said it was “time for an honest conversation on motoring taxes” with the uptake of zero-emission vehicles ahead of official government forecasts. He said that he believed the public would support a scheme despite previous opposition: “It’s important to emphasise that motorists won’t pay more. The difference between now and then is that the revenue – for roads, schools and hospitals – is ticking down to zero, unless we put 5p on to income tax. This issue can’t be dodged. We have to change policy.” Merriman said that the technology now existed to deliver a national scheme that priced up a journey based on the road, time and type of vehicle, offering better prices at less congested times. Motoring thinktank the RAC Foundation backed the call for road pricing but warned against “the temptation to create an over-complex system that’s expensive to run” – suggesting charges could be calculated and collected alongside vehicle insurance premiums. Steve Gooding, director of the foundation, said: “Drivers choosing to go electric deserve to know what is coming next – particularly if the promise of cheap per-mile running costs is set to be undermined by a future tax change. If the Treasury is thinking it can leave this issue for another day but still recoup their losses from electric vehicles they risk a furious backlash.” The Policy Exchange thinktank, issuing its own report, said road pricing could be “good for drivers” by easing congestion, and should be implemented through location-tracking technology in cars, backed up by automatic numberplate recognition.",News/Politics,"‘No viable alternative’: UK must introduce road pricing, MPs say",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/04/uk-road-pricing-transport-committee-mps-electric-shift
2/4/2022,"Jamaica will enter a four-man bobsleigh team in the Olympics for the first time in 24 years after nicking the final qualifying spot, offering a feelgood reboot for the island nation whose debut at the 1988 Calgary Games inspired the Disney film Cool Runnings. Just making it to Beijing might seem like accomplishment enough for Shanwayne Stephens, the team’s 31-year-old pilot and Royal Air Force lance corporal who emigrated to Great Britain with his family in 2002: certainly after improvised training methods at the height of the pandemic that included pushing his girlfriend’s Mini Cooper around the streets of Peterborough. But having touched down in China after undergoing their final preparations at the University of Bath, his goal is plain. “It’s got to be medalling,” Stephens says. “It’s everybody’s dream, it’s what we’re here to do. So why not aim high?” BAG  There is no such thing as a banker in an event as chaotic or frenetic as snowboard cross, where four racers take each other on down a mountain, but Britain’s Charlotte Bankes is certainly in pole position. The 26-year-old, who transferred from France to Team GB after the Pyeongchang Games four years ago, is not only the reigning world champion but has been in impressive form on the circuit this season. Bankes is at the vanguard of a strong GB snowsport team that also have reasonable medal chances in the form of Zoe Atkin, James Woods and 17-year-old Kirsty Muir, the youngest member of the Team GB squad. SI Mikaela Shiffrin, the 26-year-old American sensation of the piste whose three Olympic medals include gold in slalom in 2014 and in giant slalom in 2018, has said her plan is to race all five individual events in Yanqing and will go off as a hot medal contender in all but the downhill. That puts Janica Kostelic’s women’s record of four medals at a single Olympics on watch. The Vail native, whose 72 career World Cup wins are 14 short of Ingemar Stenmark’s all-time record of 86, can further burnish her legacy by becoming the first skier from the US, male or female, to win more than two Olympic gold medals. BAG It’s the most compelling figure skating rivalry in a generation. In one corner: Nathan Chen of the US, the three-time world champion, who has won all but one competition he has entered since a nightmarish short programme doomed him to a fifth-place finish in 2018. In the other: Japan’s Yuzuru Hanyu, the two-time defending Olympic gold medallist who became the first men’s repeat champion in 66 years at those same Pyeongchang Games. Chen goes off as the favourite on merit after winning their three most recent head-to-head meetings, but Hanyu’s knack for raising his level when the lights burn brightest makes their showdown at the Capital Indoor Stadium one of the must-watch fixtures of the coming weeks. BAG Remember how Britain briefly went curling crazy in 2002 when Rhona Martin and her stone of destiny won gold in Salt Lake City? Well, Beijing 2022 could be far bigger. The bookies rate the British mixed and men’s teams, led by Bruce “Brucey” Moaut, as favourites for gold, and the women’s team, skipped by Eve “Evey” Muirhead, as the third favourites in their event. And while there might be some parochialism baked into those odds, the form of the British teams stacks up. The men are world champions. The mixed team are world champions. And the women recently won the European championship. Three medals? It’s not out of the question. SI Haiti and Saudi Arabia are poised to make their Winter Games debuts, with these Games matching the fewest number of debutant countries at an Olympics after Squaw Valley 1960, when South Africa was alone to join the fray. In a curious twist, both will take part in the same event. Richardson Viano, a 19-year-old originally from Port-au-Prince who was adopted by an Italian couple living in France, is scheduled to compete in the men’s giant slalom alongside Fayik Abdi, a 24-year-old born in San Diego and raised in Beirut who will become the first athlete from any Gulf nation to compete in a Winter Olympics. BAG The San Francisco-born freestyle skier and IMG model competed under the US flag before switching affiliations to China, where she is known as Gu Ailing and has been positioned as the face of the Beijing Games. The 18-year-old is among the gold medal favourites in the halfpipe, slopestyle and big air events – having scored World Cup wins in all three disciplines this year – and well on her way to becoming a household name with more than 1.3 million followers on Weibo and a growing roster of sponsors including Cadillac, Tiffany’s, Visa and Victoria’s Secret. BAG It was a minor surprise when Norway, a country of only 5.4 million people, finished top of the podium at the 2018 Games, winning 39 medals. It won’t be if they repeat the trick in 2022. Indeed the data company Gracenote projects them to win 44 medals – well clear of the Russian Olympic Committee and Germany – with cross-country skiing and biathlon providing the majority of medals. But what makes Norway’s success so remarkable is they spend only a 10th of what Team GB does on Olympic sports each year – and they also stress the importance of the umbilical link between grassroots and elite sport and of putting fun and happiness ahead of medals. SI Southern Californian prodigy Chloe Kim shot to global stardom in Pyeongchang when she became the youngest female athlete to secure Winter Olympics gold on snow with a transcendent performance that included back-to-back 1080s, the gravity-defying manoeuvre she remains the only woman to have landed in competition. But she quickly found the trappings of fame – gracing the fronts of cereal boxes and magazine covers, getting name-checked in Frances McDormand’s Oscar speech – were dwarfed by her yearning for a normal life as a college student at Princeton. After nearly two years off the mountain Kim picked up right where she left off with a world title, crediting her decision to start therapy and turn focus to her mental health with helping rekindle her competitive fire. Now 21, she is the hot favourite to defend her Olympic snowboard halfpipe title. BAG A trio of boundary-pushing Russian teenagers armed with point-gobbling quadruple jumps is poised to obliterate the competition in women’s figure skating, reducing the entire podium of the Winter Olympics’ glamour event to a fait accompli. Barring a colossal surprise, the more familiar pair of the 17-year-olds Alexandra Trusova and the reigning world champion, Anna Shcherbakova, will compete for the silver and bronze medals behind the 15-year-old prodigy Kamila Valieva, the newly minted European champion who has already broken the world records for the women’s short programme, free skate and combined total in an extraordinary first season on the senior circuit.

2/4/2022,"Perhaps the greatest myth some of our political leaders are intent on weaving about the pandemic’s profound emotional impact is that Australians are uniquely, interminably resilient. Because when we look at friends (on screen), family (ditto), wander about the neighbourhood and listen to experiences from across the country, what we hear is fear, weariness and acute sadness. People are saying, “I’ve had enough – I can’t cope with it any more. I’m beyond my breaking point. I am done.”  Yes, we’ve had enough of the deaths of our unprotected elderly and physically vulnerable being statistically rationalised with an (alarmingly eugenicist) implicit sub-clause that their “pre-existing conditions” sort of made them Covid-fatality-inevitable. Enough of watching our children front up and do their part for community safety until they can’t front up any more. Enough of our constant tussles with the anxiety of whether that tickly throat, drippy nose or headache (omicrondria: excessive concern about one’s health in the absence of RATs or PCRs) might indicate we have that oh-so “mild” virus that would kill our elders who’ve dared in their crippling loneliness to risk seeing us for the first time in two years. Enough of our broken, beaten health- and aged-care workers (and, now teachers) being lectured down to about how inspirationally resilient they are when they are telling everyone they feel emotionally and physically bereft. Yes. Enough of all the hollow, gaslit assurances by the prime minister and most state and territory leaders that Australians are so just so resilient and therefore have more to give. This mythical antipodean resilience they all talk of has a long tail. It trails to an Anzac legend (itself a supposedly country-defining political construct) that is still fallaciously clung to as the moment of Australian national conception. Notwithstanding the historical whitewash that ignored all that blood on the frontier wattle from which the federation grew, the Anzac legend drew its potency from the supposedly unique qualities of mateship (the Germans and Ottomans had mates in the trenches, too!), stoicism, endurance and, yes, resilience, of those first world war personnel. Let’s not forget that in the post-world war one Australia of Billy Hughes (who assiduously linked white Australian nationhood to its spilt khaki blood in the Ottomans, Europe and the Middle East) from 1918 national growth came amid a stoic silence over the human cost of conflict. Limbless and facially disfigured diggers were kept off the streets. Physically intact men, meanwhile, privately wrestled their officially unrecognised mental demons, their alcoholism and drug addiction. Battered wives and children stayed quiet behind closed doors. “Part of our reverence for them [the Anzacs] is that somehow they endured,” former governor general and defence force chief Peter Cosgrove has explained. No surprise, then, that prime minister Scott Morrison has insisted that in pandemic times Australia must “summon the spirit of the Anzacs”. So here we are in what is, we’ve been assured (again by politicians), the most challenging time in Australia since the second world war. Here in the midst of another “war” that will be fought with resilience. Perhaps the greatest anomaly about this is the disconnect between this politically assumed Australian resilience, the unprecedented community demand for mental health support – and, indeed, the federal government’s own welcome response to it with greater access to Medicare-funded psychology (which is still falling pitifully short of demand). The overdemand on mental health services points to a society on a psychological precipice. Yet, perplexingly, we are told on one hand it’s OK to be not OK, to be at the end of our coping capacities and to ask for help, while on the other assured of our resilience. Well over a year ago psychiatrist Jayashri Kulkarni pinpointed this disconnect in her prescient essay “Is Covid-19 reshaping the Australian psyche?” in which she ponders whether the Anzac character is still an apt stereotype for the modern pandemic-era Australian. “We speak of the ‘Anzac spirit’ when we witness bravery in our firefighters and other emergency workers who have been repeatedly tested by Australia’s many natural disasters. Underpinning this historical picture of the Australian approach to calamity is the depiction of the archetypal Australian as a young, fit, stoic man. This depiction of a pioneering nation, where rugged physicality is valued and needed, seems outdated in 2020,” she writes. The Anzac ways of endurance and deep digging resilience might validate those Australians who still confront their uncertainty and fear with stoic silence. But what of the millions who don’t? Where is their validation by the politicians whose community health edicts they have faithfully followed only to watch the same leaders make appalling judgments by rationing economics over human safety, all the while bungling the mechanics of health responses and victim-blaming vulnerable casualties? Morrison is not alone among leaders when it comes to his insistence that we remain a nation of Anzac-spirited, resilient stoics amid the pandemic. But in the face of all of the outpouring of pain that speaks to the contrary, he’s probably the most bellicose and persistently cloth-eared. Take his National Press Club election campaign warm-up on Tuesday. He made close to a dozen mentions of the country’s resilience. “Despite the challenges we have faced, Australia, I believe, is stronger and more resilient today than when I stood before you a year ago.” Amplifying cliched old myths about Australian character won’t drown out the voluble national cry of anguish and frustration. The cynical evocation of some bottomless well of Australian resilience endures, today, as an emptier political construct than ever. To be human is to be vulnerable.

2/4/2022,"Zoos Victoria is training sniffer dogs to detect live platypus in their burrows as part of a research project to determine how the monotremes look after their young. The dogs were taught to recognise the odour of a platypus using scent-capturing polymer tubes which absorbed the smell of platypus sleeping in their nest boxes at Healesville Sanctuary. The tubes were then placed in the field for dogs to find.  If the detection method works, it will give scientists a way to collect much-needed data on wild platypus populations, without disturbing or interacting with the wild animals. “One of the challenges with studying the platypus and why we still know very little about them is we as humans are not well designed to see them in their natural environment,” says Healesville Sanctuary platypus keeper Dr Jessica Thomas. “They are a little brown animal and they live in a brown habitat and they spend most of their time either swimming underwater or asleep underground in a burrow. And they’re nocturnal. Quite often they either may be there or they may not be there but you can’t see them. “Part of the detection dog project is it will be a very easy and efficient way of counting how many platypus there are within a particular area without ever disturbing them.” Wildlife detection dog officer Naomi Hodgens has been working with Kip, a six-year-old kelpie cross, to detect the scent of a live platypus. The training methods are similar to those used on drug detection dogs, with two important differences: wildlife detection dogs need to be able to work in challenging and distracting environments, like a mountain stream, and they need to be safe and non-threatening toward any wildlife they encounter. It’s the latter that takes the most training, says Hodgens. Working out of Healesville Sanctuary provides the dogs with frequent opportunities to learn to studiously avoid any wildlife they encounter. She recommends that non-professional wildlife dogs be kept on a lead when in natural environments unless their recall skills are very strong – and even then a lead is safer. Kip’s wildlife avoidance skills are one of the reasons he has been nominated to lead the platypus program. “He’s got a lot of experience and his temperament is really well suited. He’s great around water, he’s really comfortable navigating quite tricky environments and he’s super resilient so he keeps trying even when things get a little bit challenging,” Hodgens says. Kip has been trained to detect the scent of a live platypus, not just scent markers on their burrows. Platypus often use multiple burrows, so Kip has been tasked with finding out which one is currently occupied. Once he finds the scent, he is trained to sit a safe distance away and point until released by his handler, and then he gets a reward. Zoos Victoria also has a three-year-old labrador named Moss and a five-year-old lagotto romagnolo named Daisy – a truffle-hunting dog – on their wildlife detection team. All are trained to recognise multiple odours including the critically endangered Baw Baw frog. All were selected for their calm temperaments and desire to work for their chosen reward – a treat, toy or tennis ball. “The dogs really think it’s a big game,” says Hodgens. Dogs have been used in weed detection, to find bats and birds struck down by the blades of a wind turbine, and to detect estrus and lactation in Tasmanian devil scat, but this is the first time they have been used in Australia to aid wildlife survey efforts. Kip has so far been finding scent markers placed by Hodgens in a training environment. In April he will get to test his skills in the field. Thomas and her team will go to Coranderrk Creek to trap and place radio collars on wild platypus. Hodgens and Kip will then search along the banks and cross-reference Kip’s finds with the radio collars. “The idea is that we’re going to make sure the dogs can detect all the platypus with the transmitters, and that will give us an indication of a success rate,” Thomas says. “If we can say that the dogs have detected 100% of the animals with transmitters on them, that will give us a lot of confidence that the dogs know what they’re doing.” If successful, the dog project will provide researchers with a reliable way to measure the current platypus population of a given waterway. Used in conjunction with environmental DNA sampling – which involves taking a sample of water to detect whether there are platypus living in the area – it could provide accurate and relatively fast survey results. Environmental DNA testing “doesn’t tell you how many – you still have to go out and survey them,” Thomas says. “So this will be a really nice complement to that technique because you can take a water sample and go, yes, there are platypus there, bring in a detection dog, run around up and down the river, and the detection dog will tell you how many live platypus there are in that area and the platypus will be none the wiser.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Victorian government listed the platypus as vulnerable on its threatened species list in January 2021 but conservation efforts are constrained by a lack of population data. Despite being one of the most recognisable Australian animals, we know very little about the monotremes. “It’s hard to believe that we don’t even really know how long incubation is because we’ve never seen a platypus lay an egg,” says Thomas. “Something as basic as that – there are not many other species that are so data deficient in Australia.”",News/Australia news,‘We’ve never seen a platypus lay an egg’: sniffer dogs to aid researchers by detecting occupied burrows ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/04/weve-never-seen-a-platypus-lay-an-egg-sniffer-dogs-to-aid-researchers-by-detecting-occupied-burrows
