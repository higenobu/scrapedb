4/19/2022,"Are there three words in the English language that can strike quite as much trepidation into the hearts of the sane and rational person as “Tucker Carlson original”? Yes, the documentary strand that brought you such titles as Hungary vs Soros: The Fight for Civilization and Patriot Purge, a BS-laden fantasy about the January 6 riots that contained so many bonkers claims about false-flag operations that it forced a tranche of Fox News veterans to quit the network, has returned. The latest addition to the Carlson oeuvre is called The End of Men and its Magic Mike-style trailer just dropped. Epic documentary from Tucker Carlson Originals: The End of Men. pic.twitter.com/xxhmOIpBqR It begins with a familiar Make America Great Again-style montage, centering on a John F Kennedy speech in which he extols the virtues of strength and exercise and berates America’s “soft, chubby fat-looking children”. Quickly, Kennedy’s reasonable-for-the-time approach to childhood obesity is equated with a precipitous decline in sperm counts and testosterone over the last 50 years. And then what could only be described as a series of money shots. As the booming timpanis of a Richard Strauss piece from 2001: A Space Odyssey swell – we see huge buff topless men, cutting wood, milking cows, firing guns, barbecuing, fighting, drinking egg yolks and most strikingly, tanning their genitals. This supposed sequence of real red-blooded males is perhaps the campest thing Fox News has aired since Glenn Beck doused a handsome model in gasoline. Carlson’s deeply homoerotic version of real men looks more xVideos than ex-mining town but the testosterone-based view of masculinity he’s pushing has been a common theme for Fox News over the past decade, and a profitable one. The testicle tanning, or “red-light” therapy, shown in the video is explained further in an interview Carlson does with a self-proclaimed “bromeotherapy” expert. He claims that by dousing your balls in red LEDs, you can create higher levels of testosterone. The potential for UV or red light to increase testosterone levels has been quite well documented but there are no peer-reviewed double-blind studies that are able to prove these claims. Testosterone levels also change dramatically throughout the day, and also see dramatic increases from exercise, new sexual partners and changes to diet. In his new special on how to raise testosterone levels in men, Tucker Carlson’s guest suggests “testicle tanning” using infrared light as a “bromeopathic” therapy. pic.twitter.com/PirerBMRyr It’s no surprise to see Fox News suggest that the answer to all of mankind’s problems are testosterone related. The channel is heavily invested in the idea that a decrease in testosterone is making men more liberal and less masculine, and many of its remaining advertisers sell pills that promise to increase men’s testosterone’s levels. I spent some time reporting this story three years ago, that testosterone was becoming heavily politicised, particularly by Trump-supporting radio hosts who equated liberalism to having low T (one rightwing radio doctor even offered a free testosterone test to any listener thinking about voting for Hillary Clinton). The US is awash with ads for testosterone supplements that make a similar claim, many of them airing on Fox News. Trump himself used to insinuate that his opponents were tired and had “low T”. Many men are injecting themselves with testosterone with political motivations but in reality the idea that testosterone is the “male” hormone and oestrogen is the “female” one is wrong. Both men and women have both hormones, at highly varied levels, and most men have far more testosterone than they need (indeed, testosterone, which is critical to heart function, is often converted into oestrogen, which means that people who routinely inject testosterone often end up growing breasts). Low testosterone can make some men feel tired and impotent and they need replacement therapy, but others get by on low levels of blood testosterone just fine. Carlson is right that sperm counts and overall testosterone have been decreasing over the last 50 years due to lifestyle changes – including rising obesity. But the idea that this in some way is a problem of manliness, and that if only we tanned our balls men would become happier, is patently untrue. The show is also a reflection of how far Carlson has shifted into the world of pseudo-scientific and bezerk solutions in the past few years. Just four years ago he was still talking about falling testosterone levels but as part of a wider soul-searching about men in America, doing pieces about why men were more likely to kill themselves, commit mass shootings, be incarcerated, be medicated as children and are performing worse by some educational measures. In the video above, Carlson takes a rightwing anti-feminist position but at least makes some reasonable points about the problems facing American men. Since then Carlson has fallen off a deep end of trolling and insanity and would rather entertain wild medical interventions than political change. Perhaps he’d be happier doing some red light therapy instead of his nightly red face therapy.",News/World news,Tucker Carlson’s answer to masculinity's supposed crisis? ‘Testicle tanning' | Sam Wolfson,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/18/tucker-carlson-masculinity-crisis-testicle-tanning
4/19/2022,"The late editor Diana Vreeland announced she was envious of surfers during a television interview in the 1970s. “To be a surfer” she said, “between the sky and the water would be, to me, the most wonderful thing”. It’s a sentiment I share, despite finding surfing cold, hard and kind of tedious. The first time I tried it, I mistook a dolphin for a shark and my enthusiasm for it never really recovered. But (like Vreeland) I love the water, and anything that allows me to spend more time in it – like wetsuits. Treated correctly, a good one can last for a decade or more. This week, experts share their advice for protecting the garments that protect you. Lesley Hillyer, owner of Aquasea Underwater Products, sees a lot of broken zips. She says people will often put their wetsuit “halfway on and expect the zipper to finish the job”. She points out that zippers are made of plastic, and cannot handle this kind of repeated strain. While it’s easy enough to repair a broken zip, a bit of extra care slipping into a wetsuit can save you time and money. She advises putting a plastic bag over your foot before you step into each wetsuit leg, as this will make it easier to pull on. If your suit has especially narrow ankles and you’re finding it difficult to take on and off, she suggests getting a professional to cut a wave pattern along the ankle opening, which will increase the surface area and make it easier to take on and off. After spending hours in the water, getting out of a wetsuit feels pretty good. But no matter how desperate you are to get warm and dry, be mindful of where you’re standing when you go to strip off. Hub Hubbard, a wetsuit product developer at Patagonia cautions against undressing on hard or rough surfaces. He suggests laying down a towel or standing in a large bucket to prevent anything abrasive from damaging your suit. Then be sure to rinse your wetsuit thoroughly with fresh water, inside and out. It’s really important to get all the salt out because it can damage your suit over time and, in the short term, a salty suit will take longer to dry. Hillyer says standing under the shower to rinse your suit is not sufficient to remove the salt. Instead, you should submerge it in a tub of water and slosh it around. Every so often, your wetsuit should be washed with a mild non-detergent soap, Hubbard says. Be sure to do this by hand and not in the washing machine, as the machine’s agitator can cause damage. Similarly, putting a wetsuit in a tumble dryer can weaken the fibres. Instead, dry your suit by hanging it in the shade out of direct sunlight, as sun ages neoprene. When you hang your suit, do so by the waist. Hillyer sees a lot of damage in the shoulders of wetsuits that have been hung on coat hangers to dry. She says this is because when the suits are wet, they are very heavy and this puts stress on the shoulders. Instead, she suggests purchasing a piece of plastic pipe from a hardware store, cutting a slit along the length of it and sliding it over your washing line. Then you can fold your wetsuit over the pipe, by the waist. When one side is dry, flip it over, so you get an even dry on both sides. If it’s raining and you need to hang the suit inside, make sure it is in a well-ventilated area to avoid mould. Hubbard says, “I keep all of mine in the garage on a hanger”. When shopping for a wetsuit it’s important to look for one that will function well for your age and build. Hillyer says suits with chest zips are “fantastic if you’re a 16-year-old boy with no shoulders, but if you’re older and less flexible, the chances of breaking the zip as you put the suit on are much higher.” If you’re trying on a suit with a back zip, make sure it is long enough in the body. If the neck of your suit feels like it’s choking you, that is because the suit is too short in back, she says. Equally, it is important your knee is sitting in the middle of the suit’s kneecap. Otherwise, your knee will put pressure on the seams above or below it, and can cause the suit to tear. If your wetsuit tears or the zip breaks, Hubbard says to get it repaired promptly so the damage doesn’t get worse. This is particularly important if a seam unravels, Hillyer says, because “the only thing holding your suit together is glue line and the seam”. If you notice a loose thread, knot it off and take it to get it fixed. “If you wait too long, the glue line will give up and your suit will tear”.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Surf’s up: how to care for wetsuits and steamers,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/19/surfs-up-how-to-care-for-wetsuits-and-steamers
4/19/2022,"In Stanley, an impossibly beautiful hamlet on the rugged north-west coast of Tasmania, Scott Morrison could easily be a creature from another planet. Alastair Houston, who owns the Ship Inn, says the prime minister is “so distant, in distance and in everything that goes on … He doesn’t know much about Tasmania.” Stanley, population 553, is in the federal electorate of Braddon. The Liberals hold the seat on a 4% margin. In the neighbouring electorate of Bass, also Liberal-held, the margin is even tighter. Bridget Archer won the seat in 2019 by just 600 votes. While the Liberals grabbed the two seats from Labor in 2019, locals aren’t sending the Coalition any herograms. In the north and north-west of Tasmania, it’s reasonably hard to find a voter with a good word to say about Morrison. In the port town of Burnie, office workers Brad Lucas and Adam Koutsoukos are returning after a lunch break. Lucas doesn’t think much of Morrison. “He’s useless,” he says. “Through all the crises that we’ve had, he’s been useless. I’m trying to do this politely.” Koutsoukos picks up the excoriation: “I don’t think he’s fit to lead, he’s only interested in consolidating his own power and status. He’s not interested in the people he’s supposedly serving and it just shows through his actions. He’s not a leader.” The sentiment is similar over the boundary in ultra-marginal Bass. In downtown Launceston, we meet Cassie (who didn’t want to share her last name), passing through Civic Square. “[Morrison’s] an idiot. He’s an absolute flaming idiot. He doesn’t do anything. He just goes on holidays and does whatever he wants. He doesn’t care about anybody other than himself, clearly.” Patience Stewart concurs. “Morrison? I think he should be buried, quite honestly,” she says. “I have no time for him. He’s reactive, there’s no forward thinking, I find him very difficult to watch now. I turn the television off when he’s on because I don’t have any faith in what he says.” Back in Braddon, Norris Hayes, in the coastal town of Penguin, feels sorry for a prime minister who has been “solid and consistent” during the pandemic. “I think he gets a hard time,” Hayes says. That’s about as adulatory as it gets. While it’s hard to find people with a good word to say about the prime minister, it’s also clear that Anthony Albanese and Labor are yet to seal the deal with many disaffected Tasmanian voters. In Penguin, a conversation with a local barber, Linda Murphy, plays out this way. What do you think of Morrison? “Not a lot.” How about Albanese? “About the same.” Over the road and out for an evening ramble, Sophia Elder thinks Albanese is not out there enough. “When there’s something major going on, you just don’t hear from him at all,” she says. “Where is he? What is he doing? Because I’m from New Zealand, I keep comparing him to [Ardern], she’s there every time something happens, just like that – I’d like to see him do that more. You just don’t hear from him.” Our Burnie duo, Lucas and Koutsoukos, distil the message we hear frequently. People aren’t negative about Albanese – as many voters were about Bill Shorten in the 2019 campaign. But the Labor leader, and his offering, remain a bit of a mystery. “Albo … he’s not a very known quantity,” Koutsoukos says. “I think the Labor strategy is let the Liberals hang themselves, let them do the work.” Lucas interjects: “But that’s done Labor a disservice because we don’t know much about him so we can’t really comment.” Koutsoukos: “Yeah.” Lucas: “Whereas the other one, we know a lot about and have a lot to comment on.” Lucas summarises the local ennui with a memorable observation. He characterises the major parties and their leaders as “two cheeks, same arsehole”. In an environment of voter disaffection, independents and minor parties are certainly on the radar of local residents. Northern Tasmania is Lambie country. A number of people we speak to struggle to identify their local member, but everyone knows the independent senator, who is now running candidates in the lower house under the banner of the Jacqui Lambie Network. Kevin Phillips in Burnie says: “I think the Jacqui Lambie party can be compared to the old-school Democrats – keep the bastards honest ... We need that voice. Will she ever become prime minister? No. But we need people like that in our parliament. I would vote for Jacqui Lambie before I’d vote for the Liberals.” We meet Gwen Grosvenor, a lifelong Liberal voter, at a garden club in Beaconsfield. She thinks Morrison performed well during the pandemic, although in her view he spent too much money. But she likes Lambie as well. “I don’t like Labor. I would never vote Labor. I like the independents. Definitely not [Clive Palmer]. I like Jacqui Lambie.” Back in Launceston, Patience Stewart, who leans Labor, says she has “great respect” for Lambie. “I feel she’s been through the mill, she’s one of the people. She doesn’t pull any punches, and I respect her for that. I don’t know whether I’d support her for a direct seat but I think Jacqui Lambie has to be in parliament because she’s one of those voices who tells it like it is.” Pantea (she won’t give her last name) in Burnie is normally a Coalition voter but she is viscerally opposed to vaccine mandates. “I’m frustrated enough not to vote for any of the major parties,” she says. “I’m definitely going with the minors this time. If we lose bodily autonomy we lose everything. There’s nothing left to lose.” Asked to nominate the big issues locally, voters across the two electorates identify rising consumer prices, a shortage of affordable housing and poor health services. Local businesses are also desperately short of staff. Julian Jacobs, a business owner in Stanley, praises the work ethic of the Braddon incumbent, Gavin Pearce. But he says things have become desperate. “If we can get people, we’ve got nowhere for them to live, with all the people coming back from overseas. I don’t think that problem is going to change quickly either. We’ve got so desperate for housing for our staff that we’ve had to buy houses in the last couple of years to put staff in.” In the north-west there is also significant controversy about a proposed windfarm development on Robbins Island, and salmon farms in Bass Strait. Alastair Houston and his wife, Kerry, are vocal opponents of the wind development. “The windfarm is currently the biggest threat we feel to our paradise,” Alistair Houston says. “It’s too close to the town. We are all for green energy, all of us are, but we feel we are being threatened by this huge development that doesn’t belong on a beautiful peninsula that is huge for tourism – 100,000 people are drawn here every year because of its beauty and unique history.” Pearce says he has shared negative community sentiment with the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley. “We had over 100 objections to that [Robbins Island project],” he says. “I can understand their concerns about the balance. Most reasonable people … understand we need that renewable sector and that means windfarms, but where do you draw the line?” The Liberal incumbent says that’s why there’s a regulatory process under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. On salmon farms in Bass Strait, Pearce says the state government has been trying to move farms away from shorelines. “Some local fishermen in Stanley are all for pushing the farms off the coastline to make sure the waste dissipates,” he says. “If a development is 12km offshore people won’t see it.” Chris Lynch, the Labor candidate, says a lot of people in Braddon “feel they need to fight for their rights when they get up in the morning”. He says not everyone has the economic, emotional and social support to feel they are experiencing the upside of the economic recovery after the pandemic, and the region needs to balance regional job creation opportunities with strong environmental oversight. He’s conscious that his position sounds like fence sitting. But he says new developments need “calm and considered investigation”. Lambie says wind turbines should be placed further down the remote west coast rather than “ruining” Robbins Island. She says salmon are now being over-farmed and could “ruin the Tasmanian brand”. The Jacqui Lambie Network is running candidates in both Bass and Braddon, and their preferences will probably determine the outcome. Lambie predicts she’ll be “queen-maker” on election night. At the time of our visit, she had not yet decided where to direct her support, but she doesn’t hide her dissatisfaction with Morrison and the Liberals. “Surely Morrison’s got to be gone,” she says. “I know change is a big thing … but quite frankly, the Liberals … have hit rock bottom. They are a very divided party and they are struggling. You can walk around and see change is in the air, but [voters] are just not 100% sold on Albanese.” Craig Garland, a fisher with a significant local profile, is also running in Braddon. The independent is a vocal opponent of the windfarm and of salmon farming in the north-west – and these days, an opponent of vaccination mandates. He will fund his campaign from income from a reality television program. “I’m a marginal-income fisherman,” he says. “This time around I had nothing. I had to borrow money off friends just to get to this point. I thought, ‘How am I going to do this?’ Signs are going to cost you eight or 10 thousand. Then, out of the blue, the Survivor show came along, believe it or not. They needed a couple of boats to conduct their filming … so they hired two boats and that’s freed my next two months up, thank God.” Over in Bass, Archer says with typical candour “it’s hard to know” whether Morrison is a plus or a minus for her in trying to hold her ultra-marginal seat. But she says it’s her name on the ballot, not his. “If you want drones and warm bodies you can have that, but if people care about local representation then they should look to the candidate – are they going to have a strong voice in the parliament? I don’t work for Scott Morrison and the Liberal party, I work for the people of Bass.” Archer stood up to Morrison on a number of issues in the last parliamentary term, but Lambie contends that, if she were serious, she’d quit the Liberal party. Lambie is also telling locals Archer can’t deliver for the seat because she has a strained relationship with Morrison. The MP says Lambie has tried and failed to recruit her, and she can’t have the argument all ways. On leaving the Liberals, she retorts: “Why should I leave? Why should I go? If your question comes from a place that all people in the Coalition are nasty, I think sometimes that’s a nebulous view … why should I go? Why shouldn’t they go? I have something to bring, I have something to offer and they can make room for me.” Ross Hart, the Labor candidate who lost narrowly to Archer in 2019, says he’s pushing Labor’s policies on sovereign capability and local manufacturing because they resonate with locals. “People are very interested to see we are trying to reinstate those well-paid secure jobs that used to be here in this community,” he says. In Beaconsfield, we meet John Farrar. He was a Labor branch president in the mid-1970s when he lived in Victoria. But he thinks Archer has what it takes to hold the seat. “Archer has twice crossed the floor against her party’s intended legislation that would be detrimental to Tasmania but more importantly her constituents,” he says. “Bridget has that moral and ethical fibre that unfortunately the vast majority of her peer group do not possess.” He says it would be a “criminal injustice” if she lost the seat because locals have had enough of Morrison. “I now vote either for the Greens or an independent such as Jacqui Lambie – although I might just change my mind and vote for Bridget in her re-election bid.” Back in Launceston, I meet an old friend, Martin Flanagan, a journalist who has moved from Melbourne back home to Tasmania. I ask him for thoughts about the contest. Flanagan calls Morrison a “failed ad man”. He says Anthony Albanese is “real”. He says Archer is real too. “I’ve said to her, she should be leader of the Liberal party. She’s a real person. I don’t think Morrison is. These are times we need to get the best people we can representing all the different viewpoints.” He says this is a consequential election. “I think we are at a critically low ebb and an historically low ebb. I think throughout the western world we are in a pretty dangerous time. The standard of our elected leaders is dropping. We live in an over-populated world, and an overheating world. “Joe Biden said about six months ago that one of the great battles of our era is going to be about whether democracy survives. I actually believe in democracy. I worry a lot for my grandkids. What sort of world are we going to be leaving them? It can’t keep going down. People will start looking for other solutions. Something like 82% of Republican voters in the US think Putin is a better leader than Biden. “This is where we are headed.”",News/Australia news,Bass and Braddon in the balance as Tasmania’s north ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/19/bass-and-braddon-in-the-balance-as-tasmanian-voters-excoriate-scott-morrison
4/19/2022,"Some cats, apparently, don’t like being walked on a leash. But some do, and according to an animal behaviour expert, some cats can be trained to walk on a lead, ensuring they can still enjoy the outdoors. More council areas are banning cats from roaming around off-leash and threatening native wildlife, so they are being herded inside. A recent study found pet cats kill about 230 million native animals a year. Add in feral cats, and the total is about 1.7 billion native animals. Research suggests cats, wild and domesticated, are responsible for dozens of extinctions, and threaten another 120 species. Owners in many areas of Australia are being told to keep cats indoors, with some councils implementing curfews and even bans on letting cats out. From July, all Canberran cats will have to be kept indoors. Greater Bendigo already does that, and the Adelaide Hills brought in similar rules at the start of the year. In many cases, though, cats are allowed day release – if they’re kept on a leash. The RSPCA says that, unlike dogs, cats are in charge on a walk: The humans are expected to follow them. (As author Terry Pratchett said: “In ancient times cats were worshipped as gods; they have not forgotten this.”) Dr Jacqui Ley, a Melbourne specialist in veterinary behavioural medicine, works with animals with mental health problems “to help them become well again”. She says you can teach a tethered cat to walk. “Some cats like going out for a walk on the lead,” she says. “They’re just like people. Some are much more sociable, outgoing, and some … like to stay home. “The trick is for the human carers, guardians and owners to figure out what sort of cat theirs is and whether or not they’re going to like it.” She concedes training a cat to walk on a lead may not be a fast process. First, find a cat harness – they’re available online, and at a range of pet stores – and it must be a harness. A cat collar won’t cut it. Then let your moggy pad about the house with it on, while it gets used to it. Treats will help. Then attach a lead to the harness, and move around the house (without pulling on it – kitten gloves, people). When you think your cat is comfy, try a stroll in the yard first, before heading into the big, wide world and bracing for the occasionally catty glance. The RSPCA’s policy is that “a leash and harness may be used to walk cats outside the owner’s property under direct supervision”, but goes on to say: “Despite some owners successfully training their cat to walk on a leash, in general the RSPCA does not recommend it”. New environments can stress a cat, the association says, and an escape-proof enclosure might be a better option. It also warns against taking cats to public parks, but doesn’t specifically mention alleys, litter, or tin roofs. Vet nurse Nina Gibbins has been diligently trying to teach her two-year-old Burmese cat Summer to walk on a lead. Summer seems deeply contemptuous of the idea that she should obey Gibbins’ directions, but relatively happy to be on a lead. So to save native wildlife, and to avoid having a fat cat, it might be worth teaching the old mog new tricks.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Secrets of the cat walk: why some pet owners are taking their feline friends out on a leash,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/18/secrets-of-the-cat-walk-why-some-pet-owners-are-taking-their-feline-friends-out-on-a-leash
4/19/2022,"The US will urge Australia to increase its 2030 emission reduction pledge this year, with a senior official declaring it was “a long time ago” when the Abbott government set the target the Morrison government says is “fixed”. The assistant US secretary of state for environmental affairs, Monica Medina, said the US was “determined that everyone raise ambition” in tackling the climate crisis in a bid to avoid “greater destruction”. In an interview with Guardian Australia from Palau in the western Pacific, where she attended an oceans conference, Medina signalled that the US was particularly focused on countries that did not commit to deeper cuts at the climate summit in Glasgow late last year. “We’re calling on every country that didn’t increase their target to raise it,” she said when asked whether Australia should lift its 2030 target this year. “We have to stay within 1.5 degrees [of heating]. Every tenth of a degree above that leads to greater disruption, greater destruction, and we can’t get those back.” Medina said Pacific island countries continually raised climate as the most important issue on their agenda because it was “an existential threat”, and she said reefs including the Great Barrier Reef were “incredibly vulnerable”. Medina works closely with Joe Biden’s special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry, who said last week the latest assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change “demands that we act sooner, quicker, faster, bigger than we are”. Australia is one of the countries that did not increase its 2030 target at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow in November, sticking with the Abbott-era 26% to 28% cut in greenhouse gas emissions against 2005 levels. Amid internal divisions within the Coalition, Australia submitted a document to the UN that “reaffirmed” that target, while touting projections the country was “on track” to reduce emissions by up to 35%. Australia is expected to face increased diplomatic pressure to formally commit to deeper cuts this year, because the Glasgow decision urged countries to “revisit and strengthen” their 2030 targets by the end of 2022 to align them with the Paris agreement’s temperature goals. Just hours after Australia signed up to that Glasgow decision, ministers Marise Payne and Angus Taylor issued a statement declaring Australia’s 2030 target “is fixed and we are committed to meeting and beating it”. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has pledged to set a 2030 emissions reduction target of 43% on 2005 levels if he wins the election, arguing the Coalition’s existing policies leave Australia sitting “in the naughty corner” at climate conferences, and corrode trust among Pacific countries. The Australian Greens want to reduce Australia’s emissions by 75% by 2030 and phase out coal and gas. In the interview, Medina avoided wading into Australian domestic politics or the current election campaign, and was careful to express the US position as applying to all countries that didn’t commit to deeper cuts last year. But when pressed on the fact the Australian formal target remained at the level it was when first set in 2015, Medina said that was “a long time ago – everyone needs to raise their ambition”. Medina, who is responsible for the state department’s bureau of oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs, reiterated the Biden administration regarded the climate crisis as “a high priority in all our diplomatic engagements”. Medina said it was important the Our Ocean conference – co-hosted by Palau and the US last week – was held in a Pacific island country “on the leading edge of the climate crisis”. “The hospital here on Palau is on the other side of a causeway and when there’s a big storm the causeway floods and people can’t get to the hospital,” she said. “When we talk to Pacific island nations they all talk about climate change as the most important thing that they have on their agenda to work with us on … and we can see it with our very eyes.” Medina said Pacific island countries were not the big emitters, “but they can be both a place for solutions and for innovation”. The Great Barrier Reef has been hit with a sixth mass coral bleaching event, the marine park’s authority confirmed last month. “We know that coral reefs are incredibly vulnerable and that the Great Barrier Reef is a global treasure,” Medina said. “It’s clearly so, so important to the Australian economy. And I know they’ve stepped up their efforts to combat acidification in the Great Barrier Reef but it’s something we all have to pay attention to.” Australia sent a delegation to Palau for the two-day conference, led by the ambassador for the environment, Jamie Isbister, and accompanied by Australia’s Sherpa for the high level panel for a sustainable ocean economy, Dr Russell Reichelt. Other issues on the agenda included curbing plastic pollution and cracking down on illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Medina said she was optimistic about the prospects of securing a legally binding, global agreement on plastic, a step she saw as “essential”. “We find plastic particles in the deepest part of the ocean and all the way up to the highest mountain peaks in the Himalayas. We find it in the polar regions, both the Antarctic and the Arctic, it’s everywhere,” she said. Medina also called for global transparency requirements for fishing boats, saying illegal exploitation of resources was “a huge problem”. “It’s hurting coastal nations. They’re losing their fish. The world is losing one of its major food sources and it’s just got to stop,” she said. Egypt is due to host the next major climate summit in November. US officials have previously said they don’t regard Australia’s 2030 target as being consistent with limiting heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.",News/Environment,US calls on Australia to increase 2030 emission reduction pledge to help prevent ‘greater destruction’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/19/us-calls-on-australia-to-increase-2030-emission-reduction-pledge-to-help-prevent-greater-destruction
4/19/2022,"Withholding judgment, appealing to critical thinking and restoring a sense of personal control are among techniques that may be helpful while speaking to people who believe in health-related conspiracy theories, experts suggest. Medical misinformation has spread widely during the coronavirus pandemic, contributing to higher Covid death rates among the unvaccinated and causing frayed relationships between friends and family members with opposing views. Writing in the Medical Journal of Australia, psychology researchers have suggested practical tips on how to talk to someone who firmly believes in health-related conspiracies. Especially during times of social unrest or uncertainty, people may turn to conspiracies to explain large-scale events, said Dr Mathew Marques, a co-author of the paper and a lecturer at La Trobe University. Conspiracy theories appeal to – but fail to satisfy – three universal psychological needs, according to the paper’s authors. These include a “need to make sense of the environment around us … [and] an existential need to reduce the threat and the vulnerability faced in everyday life”, Marques said. “We know that people, when they’re made to feel more anxious, are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories. “The [need] is one that I think most of us can appreciate, especially during lockdowns over the last few years: a feeling of isolation or not being connected to other people. “These underlying needs tend to better explain belief in conspiracy theory than … not rationally processing [things] or some sort of ‘faulty mechanism’ that in the past people have made suggestions [about].” The researchers suggest listening empathically to individuals who believe in health-related conspiracies such as Covid-19 being a hoax. “Often, people’s reaction is to tell somebody that they’re wrong … or ridicule them. That’s not going to really cause anybody to change their mind,” Marques said. Marques advocates “really trying to understand the motivations for when somebody’s speaking to you – whether it’s a patient or if it’s a close family or friend”. “Maybe they’ve had a previous poor experience with medical authorities or practitioners, and so will be highly suspicious of those authorities and individuals.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Other suggestions include making social contact and offering support to people that may help to redress a sense of lack of control in their lives. For someone who has lost a job, for example, aiding them financially could be helpful, Marques said. For conspiracy believers who perceive themselves as critical thinkers, the researchers suggest it may be helpful to appeal to this characteristic and encourage thorough evaluation of information. Evidence has also shown that “inoculating” people against misinformation before they are exposed to it – often called “pre-bunking” – can help prevent people falling for health conspiracies. The technique involves countering myths and lies before they are presented unopposed. This can be challenging because specific conspiracies change over time, Marques said, but they often portray “a powerful group involved in a malevolent cover-up against an unsuspecting public”.",News/Science,"In a pandemic of medical misinformation, how do you deal with conspiracy believers?",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/19/in-a-pandemic-of-medical-misinformation-how-do-you-deal-with-conspiracy-believers
4/19/2022,"The New South Wales government has been accused of politicising history after announcing the first 17 successful public applications for the state’s new blue plaque scheme. The $5m program – announced last June – has been modelled on a similar scheme in use across the UK for more than a century to remember notable people and places. It will see circular blue plaques placed on buildings where historical figures lived or worked, or where major events occurred, with the first ones expected to be erected around July. Sydney artist Brett Whiteley and Indigenous activist Charles Perkins were among the initial figures to be recognised from more than 700 nominations by members of the public across NSW. None of the 17 plaque locations, revealed on Monday by the NSW heritage minister, James Griffin, were in Labor-held electorates. “This initiative is all about recognising the eclectic characters, personalities and important public figures that have made or become part of the history and fabric of our state,” Griffin said. But the opposition’s heritage spokesperson, Walt Secord, accused the government of “clear partisanship” and called on the minister to explain why no sites were selected in Labor-held seats. “You would expect that historic sites across the state are spread out evenly and they don’t just occur in Coalition or independent electorates,” he said. “I would like to see a fairer distribution in the next round. “This takes petty partisanship to a new level, and disrespects those in the community who spent hours preparing their nominations.” Applications from the public were submitted to Heritage NSW by local MPs, before being verified by historians and compiled into a list by the agency that went to the minister for final signoff. Successful applications were made across varying fields, including Nancy Bird Walton who founded the Australian Women Pilots’ Association and Broken Hill-born performer June Bronhill. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Secord did not object to any of the chosen people or sites “but I wish that the Perrottet government had included a wider section of the community”. Among the proposals backed by Labor members were the Queen Street precinct in Campbelltown, the Country Women’s Association in Maitland and the Wollongong post office. When the scheme was announced last year, an initial four recipients were selected by the government, including Snugglepot and Cuddlepie author and illustrator May Gibbs and Taronga Zoo benefactor Sir Edward Hallstrom. One of the government picks – a hostel for homeless migrants run by campaigner and advocate Caroline Chisholm – was in a Labor-held seat of Maitland. In an answer to questions taken on notice during budget estimates earlier this year, Griffin explained he was in charge of rubber-stamping the plaques after they had been vetted. “Heritage NSW engaged independent professional historians to factcheck the eligible nominations,” he said. “Heritage NSW staff put forward a list of suitable nominations to me, recommending them for approval.” When questioned on the selection process in March, Heritage NSW executive director, Sam Kidman, said it was “not a political decision”. “It is based on the nominations meeting the eligibility criteria,” he said. The public will be asked to nominate more noteworthy people, stories and events later this year when more sites are added to the list. The remit for the scheme was broad and MPs were encouraged to find “interesting, quirky, and fun” nominations from constituents to go alongside the “more sombre stories that should be not be forgotten as part of our history”. The government has been contacted for comment. Plaques announced on Monday: Arthur Bryant Triggs – Yass Valley Camden Red Cross – Camden Elizabeth Jane (Bessie) Robinson – Cabonne Duke Kahanamoku – Northern Beaches Joseph Laurie – Port Macquarie Hastings Ethel Turner – Ku-ring-gai Professor Leech – Snowy Monaro June Bronhill (June Mary Gough) – Broken Hill Betro Abicare – Albury The Bishop and the Architect.

4/19/2022,"People with progressive views sometimes harbour some ambivalence towards charities, particularly those engaged in social welfare work. They believe that governments should guarantee an acceptable standard of living, and make special provision for those who are unable to provide for themselves. Viewed in this light, philanthropic efforts to help people meet basic needs such as energy costs can seem like a grim throwback to the 1930s, or Victorian times. But while such reservations are understandable, the crisis now confronting charities has grave implications and requires urgent attention from policymakers and wider society. Boris Johnson’s government, and particularly Rishi Sunak’s Treasury, deserve to be judged harshly for decisions including cruel cuts to benefits. Meanwhile, sympathy is rightly directed at the people whom these policymakers seem determined to punish. But the vital role played by the voluntary sector, both in frontline services such as food banks and in policymaking, must not be ignored. The stark reality is that the organisations we collectively rely on as a backup safety net, to make up for the deficiencies of our depleted welfare state, are under huge pressure at a time when their resources are already stretched to breaking point. A recent analysis by academics showed that a typical charity’s income dropped by 15% in the first months of the pandemic – a steeper fall than took place after the 2008-09 banking crash and recession. The Association of Medical Research Charities calculates that its members collectively lost £292m in income between 2020 and 2021. The most recent survey of individual giving carried out by the Charities Aid Foundation offered a more mixed message. It found that the total amount donated rose in 2020 – to £11.3bn from £10.6bn a year before. But it also pointed to a “worrying trend”: fewer people are donating. Adding to charities’ woes is the rate of inflation, which in March hit 7%. Given that an increasing proportion of donations are made via direct debits, which individuals are unlikely to uprate to keep up, this means that even if all current donations were to continue, charities’ incomes would fall in real terms. For those who live in comfort, the extremity of the situation faced by increasing numbers of households may be difficult to grasp. The summer will provide some respite from the pain of sky-high energy prices, since heating can be turned off. But there is no hiding from the desperation caused by a situation where incomes do not provide enough to live on. Nor should there be. A recent survey by the Trussell Trust found that almost one in 10 parents are likely to use a food bank in the coming months. Research from the Health Foundation shows that women in the poorest areas of Britain now have a lower life expectancy than the average female in every other OECD country apart from Mexico. In a recent short film for the Guardian, Sunita Ghosh Dastidar said: “It takes a village to raise a child, but who raises the village?” The answer, in a wealthy country such as the UK, ought to include far more generous support from the state for areas that were denuded by deindustrialisation, and have continued to lose out in the shift to a highly financialised property and service-driven economy. But the voluntary sector and the institutions it encompasses, from local youth centres and women’s refuges to the research arms of national charities, are vital pieces of our social fabric. Opposition politicians and campaigners must keep up the pressure on ministers with regard to rising rates of poverty and destitution. But the crisis facing the voluntary sector should concern them, and the rest of us, too.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on charities and poverty: running on empty | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/18/the-guardian-view-on-charities-and-poverty-running-on-empty
4/19/2022,"A Queensland government technical study has acknowledged for the first time that subsidence caused by coal seam gas drilling could have potential consequences for farmers in the fertile Darling Downs. Relationships between some farmers and CSG companies have become strained in the past few years, amid claims that one company, Arrow Energy, drilled diagonally beneath farmland without notifying landholders. Arrow was fined $1m last month for breaching land access rules. Guardian Australia has previously reported on concerns that Queensland has allowed the rapid expansion of the CSG industry before the long-term effects were properly understood; that the law ascribes no environmental value to farmland; and that landholders have little recourse in the event CSG drilling causes subsidence on their properties. Gas companies and the state government have previously acknowledged that subsidence would occur as a result of drilling. But for the first time, in an update to the regional Underground Water Impact Report, the state has noted that farming practices could be affected as a result. Farmers in the Darling Downs say that even minuscule changes to the flat black soil plains could disrupt soil drainage and farming methods like laser-levelled cropping, a practice that can increase yields, save water and reduce fertiliser use. In 2020, the Queensland Office of Groundwater Impact Assessment spoke with landholders about potential consequences of subsidence on farming. The report says that concerns focused on changes to ground slope that “could affect surface water drainage directions and have implications for irrigation and other farming practices”. The report included state modelling of subsidence, and estimated 10cm of subsidence has already occurred in some areas. It concluded subsidence of about 15cm could occur in some farming areas near Cecil Plains, and up to 17.5cm in areas around heavily developed CSG fields. “Subsidence may, depending upon the magnitude and rate of change over time, potentially affect the ground slope of irrigated cropping land and hence the irrigation practices,” the report says. It also suggests the maximum change in ground slope from CSG-induced subsidence in most areas would be less than 0.001% (10mm over one kilometre). Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Zena Ronnfeldt, a farmer from the Dalby area who first discovered Arrow Energy had drilled diagonally beneath her land without notifying her, said the report did not paint the full picture. She claims subsidence has occurred on one of her paddocks, affecting the drainage and ultimately the crop yield, as a result of CSG drilling. Ronnfeldt said the report uses averages from a large dataset, and that it would not “pick up the irregular patches of subsidence that are happening over time, including on our property”. “It’s impacting our land because it is not uniform. Averages mean nothing when you’re out there in the paddock on a machine that’s become bogged while trying to conduct farming operations.” The report found that more than 700 water bores would be affected by CSG operations. That figure has risen from 459 in 2016. Queensland spokesperson for the Lock the Gate alliance, Ellie Smith, said each successive state Underground Water Impact Report had shown the impact of CSG on groundwater and farmland was worsening. “The dramatic increase in the number of water bores predicted to be drained shows the government is behind the eight ball,” Smith said. “The green light was given, and continues to be given, to the voracious coal seam gas industry without a thorough understanding of how it threatens farmland and groundwater across the Western Downs.”",News/Australia news,Queensland government acknowledges subsidence caused by CSG could affect farmland,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/19/queensland-government-acknowledges-subsidence-caused-by-csg-could-affect-farmland
4/19/2022,"There is a haunting presence in the A-League Men. Shuffling from ground to ground clad in tattered purple, orange, or red and black regalia, they are the ALM revenants: those whose seasons have long since died but continue to walk amongst us. Their hopes and dreams dashed, their only purpose now is to haunt the rest who still draw breath. This is the reality of what confronts Perth Glory the Western Sydney Wanderers and Brisbane Roar as the 2021-22 season concludes. With little to no hope of finals football, supporters watch on as their beloved clubs, once so full of promise, go through the grim motions before they can mercifully be put out of their misery. Should Newcastle Jets fail to beat the Wanderers on Wednesday, they can be thrown on the pile as well. While the Glory remain the only side mathematically eliminated from the finals race, the three teams have combined to win just a single one of their last 15 matches and all, for varying reasons, are fundamentally flawed. Or deeply flawed, in the case of injury-ravaged and imploding Perth, who conceded six goals for the second time in three games as they meekly surrendered to Western United on Saturday evening. This came just days after Glory owner Tony Sage accused beleaguered fans of being “keyboard warriors” and forced chief executive Tony Pignata and interim coach Ruben Zadkovich into damage control … again. Sage’s blast, ironically delivered via a keyboard, was a bold move given fans are under no obligation to support any club and increasingly voting with their feet. Just 4,212 scattered across CommBank Stadium, for instance, as the Wanderers threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with Central Coast Mariners on Wednesday. With its occupants long since disillusioned with their club’s ability to deliver bombastic yet ultimately hollow promises of success, the crown jewel of A-Leagues stadia sat largely empty. By virtue of having a finals system that reserves space for 50% of the league, the ALM does attempt to delay the onset of this morbid state of affairs as long as it can. But in a season which will be memorable in all the wrong ways, the inevitable lull that is occurring as teams begin to wind out the clock to mostly empty stadiums and little external interest is biting even harder than normal. Of course, it’s not all bad. Melbourne City, Western United and Melbourne Victory appear set to stage a gripping, three-way battle for the Premiers’ Plate as the season enters its home stretch. Six sides are still battling it out for three playoff places on offer behind them. Then, the sugar hit that is the finals will begin. There are narratives there. Things will also be better next year, it has been promised. More stability, more investment and broadcaster Paramount+ might even add a pause and rewind option to its live streams. Fundamentally, however, the very nature of the ALM’s model means that, without change, the final part of each season will never offer much reason to pay attention to about a third of its clubs. Without the prospect of relegation to a lower tier, the existential stakes that produce some of the most gripping football on offer around the world simply do not exist. Coaches may be sacked, executives shown the exit and players moved on, but the club will always get to come back next year and pretend nothing happened. There is no tension and no stick demanding improvements. It is a scenario that allowed Melbourne Victory to essentially abdicate the tail end of the 2020-21 season with Steve Kean at the helm. It is what allowed Central Coast owner Mike Charlesworth to fail to properly invest in the club for years as the team crashed to wooden spoon after wooden spoon. It reinforces a sense of entitlement. Some clubs – their fans, history, homes and ability to contribute – are deemed more valid than others because they possess an ALM licence. And at this point that will not change, because Australia does not even have a national second division to which clubs might be relegated. An open pyramid is years away and will require a significant runway to allow for financial and infrastructural standards to ensure clubs that do rise have the capability to survive. But with Football Australia promising a second tier in 2023, progress is ostensibly being made. And as the 2021-22 season winds down and a growing list of clubs head to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for this all to blow over, the benefits that an introduction of jeopardy, both from an entertainment and survival-of-the-fittest aspect, are obvious.",Sport/Sport,Without survival of fittest A-League Men will keep ending with a whimper | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/19/without-survival-of-fittest-a-league-men-will-keep-ending-with-a-whimper
4/19/2022,"Australia’s wholesale power costs are soaring, with prices for most of the national electricity market running at double the rate promoted by the Morrison government in last month’s budget. April prices are forecast at $175 per megawatt-hour in Queensland, the most among the major east coast states, ASX futures data shows. New South Wales isn’t far behind at $173/MWh, while South Australia at $150 and Victoria just above $100. The prices – which are one factor affecting household power bills – are at odds with the Morrison government’s claims as recently as last month’s federal budget that it had lowered electricity prices. “The government is delivering on its commitment to a secure, affordable, and reliable energy supply and has achieved its goal of wholesale electricity prices under $70/MWh,” the budget said. “The government’s actions have helped reduce residential electricity costs by 8% and small business costs by 10% over the past two financial years.” Guardian Australia approached energy minister, Angus Taylor, for comment. Labor’s energy spokesperson, Chris Bowen, said: “It’s no wonder wholesale prices are double what the Coalition promised.” “Renewables with storage is the cheapest form of reliable energy, and with Barnaby Joyce back running the Liberal’s climate and energy policy, new large-scale renewable investment has plummeted,” he said. “Labor’s Powering Australia plan will get cheap, reliable electricity pumping through the Australian grid. This is the cornerstone of a strong economy,” Bowen said. There was a time, not so long ago, that the Morrison govrernment could point to electricity prices being on the slide in the National Electricity Market. (Source: AER.) #auspol #AusVotes22 #AusVotes pic.twitter.com/O5i8gQn3qV Chief executive of consultancy EnergyQuest, Graeme Bethune, said the spike in power prices was in part caused by coal-fired power plants cutting output. To fill the gap, generators were using more gas but that came at a sharply increased cost in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine disrupting global energy markets. Coal-fired power was at a record low for this time of the year since the national electricity market was set up almost a quarter of a century ago. Generation was down 342 gigawatt-hours with coal’s share of the market 62% versus 66% a year earlier, he said. “[I]n the middle of last year you had the Callide power station in Queensland explosions which knocked out half of it,” Bethune said. Coal plants were again struggling, with Liddell in the Hunter Valley formally closing one of its four units on 1 April, and two of Yallourn’s four units offline in Victoria. For months to come, whole prices in most states in the National Electricity Market can expect prices well above $100 per megawatt-hour. (Source: ASX energy futures.) pic.twitter.com/HOhotMlMVO “Certainly based on [those developments], the immediate outlook is certainly for high prices to continue,” he said. Prices were “completely at hostage particularly to what happens with coal-fired generators,” Bethune said. “If everything goes well … and they all perform, then you’ve got less of a problem than if they start keeling over.” Short-term gas prices have continued to rise for domestic users, rising 12% in Brisbane last month to $11.37 per gigajoule, EnergyQuest said. Southern gas prices rose by a similar 11.7% to $10.98/GJ. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Australian-based gas producers, meanwhile, had shown little sign of increasing production. That’s despite resources minister, Keith Pitt, stating in January Australia “stands ready to assist with any request for further supplies” should Russia invade Ukraine. According to EnergyQuest, Australian projects shipped 6.41m tonnes of liquefied natural gas in 94 cargoes last month, almost the same as the 6.42Mt shipped in February. The consultancy estimates Australian LNG export revenue fell slightly in March to $5.47bn, down from $5.63bn in February, but 88% higher than in March 2021. Australian LNG exports are showing no sign of increasing, despite record high prices and a scramble to source non-Russian gas. (Source: EnergyQuest, ABS.) pic.twitter.com/IgGEqNtTov Signs Australia might be able to ship more gas to Europe, though, are increasing. For one thing, China ramped up local production of coal and gas in the March quarter in response to higher prices, Bloomberg reported on Monday. Sinopec, a quarter owner of the Australia Pacific LNG plant in Queensland, is also signalling a reduced demand for LNG shipments from Australia in part as Covid disruptions curb orders from Chinese customers. “Their trading arm has apparently offered four spot cargoes for Europe,” Bethune said. “With high prices on the one hand and also with the Covid lockdowns, activity in China has fallen, and they find now they’ve got more gas than they need.” Bethune said governments had limited scope to intervene for local electricity or gas prices, unlike fuel prices where the Morrison government halved the fuel excise for six months, lopping 22 cents off the price per litre in one move. One likely outcome is that households and business users would face big price fluctuations in gas and electricity prices for some time, he said. “One conclusion about energy prices is [they are] extremely volatile and highly uncertain,” Bethune said.",News/Environment,Australian wholesale power costs soaring despite Morrison government’s budget claims,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/19/australian-wholesale-power-costs-soaring-despite-morrison-governments-budget-claims
4/19/2022,"Aboriginal families in at least two states have been forced to leave the bodies of their loved ones in morgues because they can’t afford a funeral after the financial collapse of their insurer, which has previously been exposed for its “misleading and deceptive” conduct. The collapse last month of Youpla Group has sparked calls for compensation for the more than 13,000 low-income Aboriginal people who face losing all they have paid into the funeral fund. Labor has said if it wins government it will set up an inquiry into the collapse, while the Morrison government has dismissed calls for compensation. But those calls for urgent help are escalating amid revelations that Aboriginal families have had to crowdfund funerals and been forced to leave the bodies of their loved ones in morgues for weeks while they raise the money. Trish Frail, a Ngemba woman and Greens candidate for Parkes in New South Wales, said it took her cousin’s family three weeks to raise the funds to pay for her funeral. “All the while their sister, niece, aunty and cousin was in the morgue. That added so much unnecessary pain and stress,” Frail said.“This needs more than an inquiry, this needs an immediate financial rescue package for families dealing with this grief and financial trauma.” The minister for financial services, Jane Hume, said people could apply for a state-assisted funeral, commonly known in the industry as a “destitute” or “pauper” funeral. Under questioning by Labor in a Senate estimates hearing before the election, Hume described Youpla as “predatory” and “shonky”. “Something we should be really proud of is that finally we’ve put a stop to this organisation’s predatory behaviour,” she said. “People affected should be aware that nobody in this country is unable to bury their loved ones without a dignified funeral.” But Kali Sailor, a Barada-Gabalbara woman, said suggesting a state-assisted funeral is “not good enough”. “I’ve been through a couple of pauper funerals, state-assisted funerals,” Kali said. “In some cases you can’t have a church service, it has to be graveside, and for a lot of our people who’ve been on missions that’s huge for them. “These old people, who stayed loyal to the churches, they expect nothing less than to be buried with a church service. Now, because of this collapse – on the government’s watch – it’s sickening, and it’s really stressful.

A lot of them do have a … timeframe for their life because they’re that old. I’ve seen aunties stressing about it now they’re in their 80s.” State-assisted funerals have strict caveats. They are available only if a family can prove they have no other way of paying, and are limited to cremation or a very basic service provided by a government-approved funeral director. In NSW, if relatives refuse a cremation and request a burial, the body will be buried in a common grave identified by a number with no other headstone. In Sailor’s home state of Queensland, families must prove that no other family members are able to pay. If a family qualifies for assistance, they may not choose the location of the funeral, or the funeral director. Sailor and her husband paid into a Youpla fund for 20 years, until they heard in March the company had gone into liquidation. “And then when I started doing a bit of research looking into what’s been going on, I found out they hadn’t been regulated by the government. They’ve made a fool out of the government, but at our expense, at the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities’ expense,” she said. Sailor and her husband stand to lose $16,500. They have since tried to find alternatives but Sailor said because of chronic ill-health neither of them can get life insurance. “We thought we were being constructive about doing something for sorry business,” she said. “We thought we’d taken that burden off our family. There’s a lot of frustration. We are stressing out, trying to get something set up. “I don’t think it’s fair that the burden should be on my children.” Youpla, previously known as the Aboriginal Community Benefit Fund, was a Gold Coast-based private business that for decades allegedly aggressively sold funeral insurance almost exclusively to Aboriginal people, including children and babies. In April 2020 it was banned by financial regulators from selling any new policies because it did not have a financial services licence, but at its peak had about 25,000 clients. Member contributions to the three funds at the time it collapsed totalled $39.2m. The liquidator said there was now just $11.9m left and it remained unclear whether any contributors would see a refund. The Australian Financial Complaints Authority has received more than 500 complaints against Youpla Group funds since 2018, and has issued 178 decisions against the group for “misleading and deceptive conduct”. Labor has said if it wins government it will establish an inquiry into Youpla’s operation. The proposed inquiry would cover topics including the part played by Youpla’s directors and the bodies that regulated the fund – the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and NSW Fair Trading. Labor’s shadow assistant treasurer Stephen Jones and Indigenous affairs spokesperson Linda Burney wrote to the government two years ago warning that Aboriginal families would be “ripped off twice” if Youpla collapsed. In the letter to the treasurer Josh Frydenberg and minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt, Burney and Jones asked for a “clear commitment from the government that in any eventuality, policyholders and their families will be protected”. Frydenberg and Wyatt did not respond to the letter, Jones told Guardian Australia. “Clearly, whoever wins the next election is going to have to deal with this issue, and face up to the fact that the government has been negligent,” Jones said. NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge said the federal government should underwrite all current policies and pay for funerals this policy year. “This is grief layered on grief,” Shoebridge said. “Having let this happen, the federal government needs to step up and provide an immediate solution for families dealing with sorry business.”",News/Australia news,Bodies of Indigenous families’ loved ones left in morgues after collapse of funeral insurer Youpla,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/19/bodies-of-indigenous-families-loved-ones-left-in-morgues-after-collapse-of-funeral-insurer-youpla
4/19/2022,"A former Australian SAS soldier alleged by three newspapers to have ordered the execution of an unarmed elderly man in Afghanistan will be the first witness-in-reply called by Ben Roberts-Smith in his war crimes defamation trial. Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. A retired comrade of Roberts-Smith’s, anonymised before the court as Person 5, will be the first soldier witness called by the decorated SAS veteran on Tuesday morning. Person 5, a former SAS patrol commander, was part of a raid on a compound known as Whiskey 108 in the village of Kakarak in Uruzgan on Easter Sunday 2009. The alleged murders of two men – one an elderly man, the other a disabled man with a prosthetic leg – who were allegedly found hiding inside a secret tunnel in a courtyard inside the Whiskey 108 compound, are two of the key allegations made against Roberts-Smith as part of the newspapers’ defence. In the newspapers’ defence before the federal court in Sydney, it is alleged that after the Afghan men were pulled out of the tunnel, Roberts-Smith was present when Person 5 ordered another Australian soldier – Person 4 – to execute the elderly man. “Pursuant to that order Person 4 placed [the Afghan man] on his knees and shot him in the back of the head. Person 4 was ordered to execute [the Afghan man] so that he could be ‘blooded’,” the defence document states. The newspapers allege Roberts-Smith “did not say or do anything to encourage Person 5 to withdraw the order or to stop Person 4 following the order”, arguing that he was complicit in, and approved of, the man’s murder. The court has also heard previous evidence about premeditation. One soldier witness, known as Person 24, told the court that hours before the Whiskey 108 assault, he saw Person 5 in the SAS headquarters. “Person 5 came to the doorway of our patrol room and he was in a jovial manner, dancing a bit of a jig,” Person 24 said. “He said that we are going to ‘blood the rookie’.” Person 24 said he understood the phrase to mean “they were going to facilitate or put [Person 4] … in a position where he could get a kill under his name”. Person 4 has already given evidence in this trial, spending five days in the witness box. But Person 4 refused to answer questions about his actions at Whiskey 108: “I object on grounds of self-incrimination,” he told the court. After intense legal debate, Justice Anthony Besanko ruled he should not be compelled to respond. Another SAS soldier, Person 41, has given a slightly differing account of the alleged murder of the elderly Afghan man, alleging it was Roberts-Smith who gave the order he be executed. Person 41 told the court: “RS [Roberts-Smith] walked down and grabbed the Afghan male by the scruff of his shirt.” He said Roberts-Smith walked the man about 2 metres until he was in front of Person 4, “then kicked him in the back of the legs behind the knees until he was kneeling down … RS pointed to the Afghan and said to Person 4 ‘shoot him’.” Person 41 said he did not want to witness what he realised was about to occur, and stepped back into a room off to the side of the compound. He said he heard a muffled round fired from an M4 rifle before waiting another “15 or so seconds” and stepping back into the courtyard. He said Roberts-Smith was no longer in the courtyard, but Person 4 was standing above the Afghan male, who was dead from a single bullet wound to the head. Under cross-examination, Person 41 was questioned why he hadn’t reported what he’d seen to his commanders. “I just wanted to keep quiet about the whole thing,” he told the court. “I was a new trooper, on my very first trip with the SAS, I just wanted to toe the line. It’s the unwritten rule – you go along with whatever happens.” On another day in the hearing, Person 41 was also queried about antipathy towards Roberts-Smith within the SAS. He agreed there were “haters” within the regiment, jealous of his decorations. In his testimony, Roberts-Smith maintains the execution could not have happened because there were no people discovered in the hidden tunnel in the compound courtyard. Four times during his evidence-in-chief and cross-examination he told the court “there were no men in the tunnel” or “there were no people in the tunnel”. He said testimony that men were pulled from the tunnel was “completely false”. A year after the Whiskey 108 raid, Person 5 served alongside Roberts-Smith at the battle of Tizak, for which Roberts-Smith was decorated with the Victoria Cross. Person 5 was awarded the Star of Gallantry for his actions in that battle. Within the SAS regiment, that battle is legendary, but also controversial. The court has heard that the regiment, at that time, was a “toxic” environment, beset by factionalism and feuding, and riven by internecine fighting over decorations. A serving SAS noncommissioned officer, Person 7, told the court Person 5 “bullied” his subordinate soldiers to write letters in support of Roberts-Smith’s VC commendation from Tizak, which, he argued, effectively stole credit from others.

In earlier cross-examination Arthur Moses SC, acting for Roberts-Smith, put it to Person 7 he had engaged in “character-assassination” of Roberts-Smith and was “consumed by hatred” for the VC winner. “I don’t hate RS whatever,” Person 7 said. “Everything I said was based on personal experience I’d had with him.” Last Thursday, the newspapers being sued closed their case, with a final soldier witness spending a morning under cross-examination in closed court. Eighteen soldier witnesses, three civilians and three Afghan nationals appeared as part of the newspapers’ case, most of them under subpoena. Roberts-Smith has listed up to 30 potential witnesses-in-reply, but he is expected to call about half that number. Their evidence is likely to take a month. Roberts-Smith himself can also take the stand again, but only to address allegations or issues that were not raised during his first 11 days giving evidence.",News/Australia news,Ben Roberts-Smith to call ex-SAS member alleged to have committed war crime as his first reply witness in defamation trial,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/19/ben-roberts-smith-to-call-ex-sas-member-alleged-to-have-committed-war-as-his-first-reply-witness-in-defamation-trial
