4/27/2022,"Labor will support the global push for multinationals, like Google and Facebook, to face a minimum 15% tax rate and also limit debt-related deductions – measures which it says will raise $1.89bn over the forward estimates. The shadow cabinet was meeting on Wednesday morning to sign off on the details of the long-telegraphed policy ahead of an announcement later in the afternoon. Guardian Australia understands Labor will commit to supporting the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s “two pillar” solution to ensure multinational enterprises are subject to a minimum 15% tax rate from 2023. Labor will also limit debt-related deductions by multinationals to 30% of profits, which it says is consistent with the OECD’s recommended approach – while maintaining the “arm’s length” test and the worldwide gearing ratio. The policy will also include transparency measures including new reporting requirements on tax information, beneficial ownership, and tax haven exposure. About 140 countries have backed the OECD position, a move that would force the world’s biggest companies to pay a fair share of tax. Under the landmark reforms, a new taxing right will be created enabling countries to levy a slice of the profits generated by a handful of the world’s biggest firms, based on the sales generated within each country’s borders. Labor’s new budget strategy to be released on Wednesday notes Australians have been paying more tax and “losing out on funds that should be available for vital services like Medicare, aged care and child care while multinationals have been using tax havens and tax avoidance schemes to avoid paying tax in Australia”. The document also confirms the opposition is not proposing tax reforms beyond the changes affecting multinationals. It also commits Labor to delivering the stage three tax cuts which predominantly benefit high-income earners. The Morrison government has previously signalled support for the OECD framework. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has argued those proposals will help to reduce corporate tax arbitrage and profit shifting. But last week, Scott Morrison gave an “ironclad guarantee” that the Coalition would not raise taxes in the next term of parliament if he wins on 21 May – which prompted the opposition to query whether the government remained committed to multinational tax avoidance. Morrison has also reaffirmed the government’s commitment to capping tax receipts at 23.9% of GDP. Labor’s budget strategy document says the opposition is “not attracted to the current cap and does not believe it needs to be revisited, given that both sides will not approach it in the forward estimates”. As well as the crackdown on multinationals, Labor’s budget strategy will include undertaking an internal audit of what it terms “rorts and wasteful spending” and trimming commonwealth spending on consultants and labour hire.

The Morrison government also suspended its own fiscal rules during the pandemic as it rolled out billions in economic stimulus. Labor’s budget strategy document notes “the best way to fix the budget and pay down debt is to lift growth and boost incomes, and the best way to improve the economy and lift growth is to make smart and responsible investments to expand productive capacity, so the economy can grow faster than debt”. It says the economic plan for the next term, in the event Anthony Albanese wins on 21 May, will “begin with expanding the capacity of the economy so that it can grow faster than debt” and judging spending “based on the quality, not just quantity, of investment to ensure our policies are the most efficient ways to achieve maximum economic benefit”. The document touches on expenditure restraint by saying: “Labor understands that there is not scope to spend on every good idea and that we can’t undo the damage done over a decade in one budget or even one term – and that we need to prioritise and sequence and be responsible.”",News/Australia news,Labor to support global push for minimum 15% tax rate on multinational corporations,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/27/labor-to-support-global-push-for-minimum-15-tax-rate-on-multinational-corporations
4/27/2022,"Australia faces the prospect of a pre-election rate rise by the Reserve Bank after underlying inflation pace soared to its highest in 13 years while the broader consumer price measure increased at the quickest pace since the GST was introduced in 2000. The 5.1% annual consumer price index (CPI) reading for the March quarter easily topped the market expectation of 4.6% pace. The so-called trimmed mean inflation, which strips out volatile changes and is used by the central bank to set rates, rose 3.7%, or the most since March 2009. While the headline quarterly rate of 2.1% also easily exceeded the consensus expectation of 1.7%, the trimmed mean measure was also sharply higher at 1.4% – the highest since the ABS began the series in 2002. “If the Reserve Bank wasn’t convinced that it had the evidence for a rate hike last month, it does for the May meeting next week,” Cherelle Murphy, EY’s chief economist, said. “A record low cash rate of 0.1% is clearly now no longer appropriate for this economy, meaning the Reserve Bank must join other central banks around the world and tighten monetary policy,” she said. “To not do so risks the RBA losing credibility.” The last time the RBA raised interest rates during a federal election was in 2007 when then prime minister John Howard lost the subsequent poll to Kevin Rudd. The RBA board meets on 3 May and before today’s CPI figures, markets had mostly ruled out an increase from the record low cash rate target of 0.1%. Those expectations have now shifted, sending the Australian dollar higher and stocks lower. As anticipated, fuel, food and material costs were among the items posting big increases in the first quarter of 2022. Energy prices had already been heading higher before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, but the war added impetus with fuel up 11% in the quarter alone – the most since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. “The CPI’s automotive fuel series reached a record level for the third consecutive quarter, with fuel price rises seen across all three months of the March quarter,” said Michelle Marquardt, head of prices statistics at the ABS. Quarterly headline CPI figures were also the highest since the GST’s introduction almost 22 years ago. Food prices rose 2.8%, with vegetables alone up 6.6%, fruit up 4.9%, and beef up 7.6% in the March quarter. The pace of food price increases, including 4.3% year-on-year, is the most since 2011, Rabobank said. Only clothing and footwear, among the ABS categories, fell for the quarter and compared with a year earlier.The Morrison government has been bracing for a bad number, linking its $250 cost-of-living payment to 6 million recipients to coincide with today’s CPI release. A weekly survey of consumer sentiment by ANZ and Roy Morgan out today showed confidence had stalled after rising for three weeks following the 29 March federal budget. Marquardt said the higher inflation rate reflected in part the disruptions to supplies from the Covid pandemic. “This reflected the broad-based nature of price rises, as the impacts of supply disruptions, rising shipping costs and other global and domestic inflationary factors flowed through the economy,” she said. The federal government’s 22.1 cents cut in the fuel excise will take some of the sting out of petrol prices during the June quarter, and much of the September one. “Pegging the first rate hike in the cycle to a high CPI outcome is best from a public presentation perspective,” David Bassanese, an economist with Betashares, said. “It reminds the public that the RBA is targeting inflation and is actively working to contain inflation expectations in the current environment.” The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, highlighted other nations’ higher inflation. The US’s latest CPI was 8.5% for the March quarter, the UK’s 7% and 6.9% in New Zealand but just 0.9% in Japan. Those nations with a higher inflation rate, though, have already started lifting interest rates with more to come. Once the RBA starts lifting rates, though, a similar steady pace of rate rises is expected to curb inflationary pressures but at the cost of households and businesses’ loan repayment costs. Andrew McKellar, chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the CPI data reflected the squeeze on many businesses who had only “a limited ability to pass on these costs to their customers through higher prices”. “International trade bottlenecks are producing supply constraints on a scale not seen in almost 50 years,” McKellar said. “Any additional tightening of supply-side constraints is going to further squeeze the profitability of businesses across the country.” Two more ABS releases of note are scheduled before the 21 May election. The March quarter wage price index, due out on 18 May, will probably show wage increases have not kept up with the 5.1% CPI increase, implying salaries are shrinking in real terms. The other may be a happier outcome for the government, with the April jobless data due out on 19 May. The March figure was just under 4%, near a half-century low, and may fall a bit further.",News/Business,Australia faces prospect of pre-election rate rise as inflation and consumer prices soar ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/27/australia-faces-prospect-of-pre-election-rate-rise-as-inflation-and-consumer-prices-soar
4/27/2022,"A mysterious liver disease that has infected children in a dozen countries around the world has reached Asia, with a case reported in Japan. The case in Japan of acute hepatitis – or inflammation of the liver – of unknown origin was flagged by local authorities on 21 April in a child who had tested negative for adenovirus – a possible cause being investigated worldwide – and Covid-19. The patient had not had a liver transplant, the health ministry said on Monday, without giving further details. Canada’s Public Health Agency said on Tuesday it was investigating reports of severe acute hepatitis of unknown origin in young children. It did not reveal the number of cases or their location. So far across the world, 190 mystery cases of acute hepatitis in children have been reported, with 140 of them in Europe, mostly in the UK (110 cases). Further cases have been found in Israel and in the United States. Seventeen children became so sick they needed liver transplants. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a nationwide health alert last week that the first US cases were identified in October in Alabama. The first UK cases were recorded in January. On Saturday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said at least one death had been reported in connection the outbreak. The UN health agency said the cases were reported in children aged between one month and 16 years. The WHO did not say in which country the death occurred. Hepatitis is usually caused by one of several contagious hepatitis viruses, but these have not been found in the affected children. Jaundice, diarrhoea and abdominal pain are among reported symptoms. One theory being investigated by the UK Health Security Agency is that a lack of exposure to the common adenovirus – which usually causes stomach upsets and colds – during the coronavirus pandemic has led to more severe illness among children. Of 53 cases tested in the UK, 40 (75%) showed signs of adenovirus infection. Public Health Scotland’s director, Jim McMenamin, told Reuters that work was under way to understand if an adenovirus has mutated to cause more severe disease, or if it could be causing the problems “in tandem” with another virus, including possibly Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. UK officials said there was “no link” between the cases and the Covid-19 vaccine, because none of the children affected by hepatitis had received a jab. Andrea Ammon, director at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Stockholm, said: “So far there is no connection between the cases and no association to travel.” The disease appeared in previously healthy children, Ammon said.",News/Technology,Global mystery hepatitis outbreak spreads to Asia and Canada,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/27/global-mystery-hepatitis-outbreak-spreads-to-asia-and-canada
