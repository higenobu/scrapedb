4/30/2022,"With awkward embraces and fixed grins, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Mohammed bin Salman struck a pose of reconciliation. For the past three years, the presence of the Turkish leader and the Saudi crown prince in the same room would have been unthinkable, but in a drawing room of a Jeddah palace on Friday, both tried to signal a new beginning. There was no sign of the acrimony that had set the regional rivals apart and – most definitely – no mention of the reason for the rift: the Saudi murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Instead, Erdoğan, who had been prepared to take bilateral relations between regional heavyweights beyond the brink, seemed content to be standing in his rival’s palace. The Saudi crown prince, meanwhile, had the look of a man who had won a prize. The path to this point had been fraught. Ties between Saudi Arabia and Turkey had been mostly severed since October 2018, when a team of assassins, most of them security aides to Prince Mohammed, flew to Istanbul to ambush and dismember the Saudi dissident inside the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul. But the murder was taped by Turkish spies and the ensuing investigation led to the heart of Prince Mohammed’s court, resulting in Erdoğan boycotting the defacto leader and rebuffing billions of dollars in compensation offered by Saudi envoys. It also amplified a faultline at the time between an alliance of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt, on one hand, and an opposing bloc of Qatar, Turkey and the remnants of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood on the other. For more than three years, the two sides dug in, and Erdoğan rarely missed a moment to embarrass the Saudi heir, or to assert Ankara as a regional counterweight to Riyadh. But, battered by a troubled economy at home, facing an election, and seemingly tiring of isolation, Erdoğan’s hardline stance has gradually given way to realpolitik. He has reached out to the UAE and Israel and has even made overtures to Egypt, where ties have remained poisonous since the coup that ousted the regime of Mohamed Morsi and ushered in the strongman Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Saudi Arabia, however, was the trickiest bridge to cross. For Erdoğan to win a reset, he needed to eat humble pie. Last year a view started to take shape in Turkey that it had reaped little advantage from its standoff with Riyadh. With Donald Trump still in the White House, there may have been more of an angle for leverage. But the 2020 US election changed that; Joe Biden has distanced himself from both leaders, and neither are particularly fond of him. If there was to be detente, however, one problem needed to be fixed; the ongoing in trial in absentia in Istanbul of Khashoggi’s accused killers. Earlier this month, Prince Mohammed got his wish when a Turkish prosecutor decided to stop the trial. The stage was set. So, with eyes on trade ties, and using a pilgrimage to Mecca as cover, Erdoğan stood in front of Prince Mohammed on Friday, his ambitions to consolidate a rival power base to Riyadh subsumed by domestic politics and a desperate need for economic growth that trade ties with Saudi Arabia would help Erdoğan also paid homage to the Saudi monarch, King Salman, with whom he had tried to deal directly in the weeks after Khashoggi’s death in an effort to sideline Prince Mohammed. At home, his visit was observed in sombre tones, with any mention of Khashoggi kept to a minimum. “My visit is the manifestation of our common will to start a new era of cooperation as two brotherly countries,” Erdoğan said before leaving Istanbul. He was met in Jeddah as if nothing had ever split the two countries. Privately, however, Saudi officials were jubilant. Erdoğan’s trip had capped Turkey’s ambitions to play more of a regional role, one official told the Guardian. “He needs us more than we need him, and he’s the one traveling to us. This stance of his has cost him billions in lost revenues. Any trade will be on our terms.”",News/World news,Khashoggi row goes unmentioned as Erdoğan seeks to boost Saudi trade ties,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/29/khashoggi-row-goes-unmentioned-as-erdogan-seeks-to-boost-saudi-trade-ties
4/30/2022,"Facebook moderators have called on the company to let them take action against users who praise or support the Russian military’s atrocities in Bucha and across Ukraine. Almost a month after evidence of widespread murder and mass graves was uncovered by Ukrainian forces taking the suburb of Kyiv, the social network still has not flagged the atrocity as an “internally designated” incident, the moderators say. That ties their hands in how they can treat content related to the killings, they say, and forces them to leave up some content they believe ought to be removed. “It’s been a month since the massacre and mass graves in Bucha, but this event hasn’t been even designated a ‘violating event’, let alone a hate crime,” said one moderator, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity. “On that same day there was a shooting in the US, with one fatality and two casualties, and this was declared a violating event within three hours.” Under Facebook’s public moderation guidelines, users are barred from posting content that makes violent threats through “references to historical or fictional incidents of violence”. But in private documents issued to moderators, who work for third-party contracting firms such as Accenture or Bertelsmann, they are told to wait for regional input from Facebook itself before determining whether a “documented violent incident” counts. In the absence of that input, content that praises events in Bucha is tough to remove if it’s even slightly coy about whether it’s celebrating the murder of people. One post, for instance, showed a T-shirt featuring a butcher carving up a pig, with Russian text on it reading “РеZня в Буче Можем поVторить” – “Slaughter in Bucha, we can repeat”. “My suspicion is that this is just not as close, not as important to American audiences or the American public, so it just doesn’t get the attention,” the Facebook moderator said. “After two weeks I realised that they probably aren’t going to do anything about it. “I was quite happy with the initial reaction of Facebook to the war,” they added. “I was quite happy with the exceptions that were made that allowed dehumanising speech against soldiers. Those changes brought some balance into the policies: victims and oppressors were not treated the same and were not given the same rights. But now, it has become clear that what counts for Facebook is American public opinion. They only care if they look good in the US media.” In a statement, a spokesperson for Meta, Facebook’s parent company, said: “It’s wrong to suggest we wouldn’t remove graphic content that celebrates or glorifies the atrocities in Bucha, or any post that mocks the death of individual victims or advocates for violence against Ukrainians in any way. “We’ve longstanding policies that make clear this content is not allowed on Facebook and Instagram,” they added. “We have been providing additional guidance to content reviewers on these policies and content associated with the war in Ukraine to explain how our policies apply in the current context, and will continue to do so.” State use of force is treated differently to criminal acts of violence under its policies, Facebook said, based on extensive consultations with outside experts. The issue was raised by the nonprofit campaign group Foxglove Legal. Its director, Martha Dark, said: “Facebook can act swiftly on mass killings when it wants to. In the US, for example, mass shootings tend to be classed within hours as a ‘violating event’ – this blocks posters from praising the murders, celebrating the perpetrators, or calling for more violence. “The Bucha massacre happened a month ago. Facebook has a simple policy it could adapt to end this now. It just can’t be bothered. Facebook will claim for the hundredth time that it ‘takes these matters seriously’ and is ‘working closely with moderators’ to fix them. That’s just spin from a tech giant that cares only about the bottom line.”",News/Technology,Facebook moderators call on firm to do more about posts praising Bucha atrocities,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/29/facebook-moderators-call-on-firm-to-do-more-about-posts-praising-bucha-atrocities
4/30/2022,"“Just be careful where your back end is going,” says the instructor as this reporter nervously steers a 44-tonne articulated Volvo lorry on a roundabout. It is good advice at roundabouts, as in life. The trailer rolls past the safety barrier with a barely visible gap, to the relief of everyone involved. It is a manoeuvre played out across the world countless times each day as lorries lug the goods required for modern life from factory to consumer. However, this truck is slightly different: instead of a diesel engine, it is running on natural gas. It is one of the products of a series of bets by lorry manufacturers on how to reduce the carbon footprint of road transport, a key contributor to global carbon emissions. About 16% of the UK’s carbon emissions in 2019 were from heavy goods vehicles, which carried 1.4bn tonnes across 17.8bn km in the year to June 2021, according to the Department for Transport. Manufacturers are backing a range of technologies from gas, to battery electric and various types of hydrogento try to decarbonise those journeys – but none has yet succeeded at scale. Everyone who drives an electric car for the first time after a lifetime of petrol or diesel has had the moment of realisation: this really is the future. A similar dynamic is happening now with lorries. At the same test drive event, held this week at the Millbrook Proving Ground by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, there was also the chance to try out the LF Electric, assembled by Dutch lorrymaker DAF Trucks at its Leyland subsidiary in Lancashire. Compared to the noise and judder of a diesel engine it is a serene experience on a sunny spring day in the rolling Bedfordshire hills. So serene, in fact, that another good-natured instructor has to intervene to prevent another roundabout mishap. The problems are range and cost. The LF Electric, of which 25 have been built so far, has a 220km range and smaller 19-tonne capacity that prevents it from taking on the motorway trucking routes that serve as the backbone of modern economies. And the sticker price is currently three times that of a diesel. Even Elon Musk has been unable to crack the problem, judging by the Tesla Semi which is now years overdue. Nikola this week began production of electric “semis” at its new Arizona plant, but only after its founder, Trevor Milton, was charged with allegedly rolling a prototype down a hill to pretend it was working. Some experts think it will be 2025 before larger electric trucks hit the mainstream. David Cebon, a professor of mechanical engineering at Cambridge University, has just completed the first stage of a government-funded feasibility study into a novel solution to batteries’ lower-energy density. An electric road system, or e-highway, would install train-style overhead charging cables on main roads. Topping up a smaller battery through catenary cables on the road would save on the cost of buying more battery capacity for every lorry, and it would be more energy efficient and less damaging to roads because there would be less weight on the move. However, it would need full government buy-in to give permission and investment estimated at (a relatively modest) £19bn to cover most of the UK’s freight. There is lower-hanging fruit in mid-duty trucking. Startup Volta Trucks is developing its products in Warwick in the UK, with the aim of building as many as 5,000 7.5-tonne and 12-tonne all-electric lorries in 2023, and a target of 14,000 the year after. The factory in Austria formerly made diesel vans. Another startup, Tevva, is planning to make 9,000 7.5-tonne battery and hydrogen fuel cell trucks by 2025, in part at a site in Tilbury, Essex. Volta will start a trial with the crown estate in the summer to supply central London shops from out-of-town warehouses. Essa Al-Saleh, Volta’s chief executive, told the Guardian: “That’s an ideal case for electrification where you only need to deploy charging infrastructure at the depot, or at the warehouse.” The demonstrator seen by the Guardian just off London’s Regent Street earlier this year looks very different to traditional trucks, with the driver sitting at eye level with pedestrians and cyclists – potentially improving safety. Al-Saleh thinks batteries will dominate, albeit with niches for other powertrains. “I do think there are a lot of innovations that are extending the ranges and density of batteries, enabling longer distances,” he said. The natural gas option is, of course, still a fossil fuel, so its combustion has a significant carbon footprint, and Russia’s war on Ukraine has added to the impetus to shift away from reliance on it in the long term. A cleaner alternative is methane produced by anaerobic digestion of food waste, known as biogas or bio-LNG (liquefied natural gas). Gasrec, a company working on gas refuelling stations for the likes of Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda, estimates that a truck running on bio-LNG reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 90% compared to a diesel. Even Sweden’s Volvo and Iveco, an Italian-listed manufacturer whose S-Way is also available in natural gas version, are open about the fact that methane combustion is a transition technology. Lars Stenqvist, head of trucks technology at Volvo Group, said: “It’s clear to us that we need more than one solution to decarbonise transport. We currently see three technologies in parallel that will decarbonise the heavy vehicle industry. We are investing more than ever into combustion engines, battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles.” One of the big unanswered questions in trucking is hydrogen’s role. Hydrogen is energy dense and offers very quick refuelling. Fuel cells can power electric motors with water as the only exhaust emission. Brendan Bilton, chief technology officer of Element 2 (a reference to hydrogen’s place in the periodic table), is building a hydrogen refuelling network in the UK. He argued hydrogen would be needed for the biggest lorries doing long-haul routes without time to recharge. “We haven’t heard anyone saying, ‘we’re just waiting for our 44-tonne truck to get a battery,’” he said. “It just doesn’t work.” However, there are big questions over the amount of electricity needed to make green, high-purity hydrogen to power a large proportion of the world’s lorries. For this reason some analysts believe hydrogen fuel cells – or another option, combustion – will play a relatively small role. “The potential future market for hydrogen vehicles is shrinking daily,” said Gniewomir Flis, who scouts electrochemical technologies at Energy Revolution Ventures, an early-stage investor. “I believe the majority of trucks will be battery electric.”",News/World news,‘This really is the future’: HGV manufacturers race to decarbonise trucks,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/29/hgv-manufacturers-race-to-decarbonise-trucks-lorries-carbon-footprint-uk
4/30/2022,"The bereaved parents of three babies who died after being given contaminated feed while in hospital have insisted justice has not yet been served after the pharmaceutical company that supplied the batches was fined £1.2m. Relatives of the children, who were among 19 infected with Bacillus Cereus bacteraemia at nine hospitals in England, said the fine would be a drop in the ocean to ITH Pharma, which they accused of carrying on as normal. Yousef Al-Kharboush was nine days old when he died at St Thomas’ hospital in central London on 1 June 2014, having developed sepsis. He and his twin brother, Abdulilah, were born by emergency caesarean section at St Thomas’ at 32 weeks’ gestation in May 2014. While in intensive care they were both fed intravenously. While Abdulilah was not affected, Yousef died. Tameria Aldrich, whose twin sister Tia also survived, died nine days after Yousef after being transferred to St Thomas’ from Broomfield hospital in Chelmsford, while Oscar Barker died at Rosie maternity hospital in Cambridge. The 19 children who were infected were all given ITH Pharma’s total parenteral nutrition (TPN) between 27 May and 2 June 2014 as nutrition directly into their bloodstream because they were unable to feed on their own. Prosecutors claimed ITH Pharma’s failure to carry out a proper risk assessment resulted in the death of Yousef, though TPN was not alleged to have caused the deaths of the other two babies. On Friday, judge Deborah Taylor at Southwark crown court ordered the firm, which had a £66.8m annual turnover up to September 2020, to pay a fine of £1.215m and costs of £291,000 after it previously pleaded guilty to three offences. But she said: “I did not find the causation of Yousef’s death is proved to the criminal standard.” She added that, for legal purposes, the bacteraemia had not necessarily caused actual harm, but the company’s processes risked “serious harm and or death”. Raaid Sakkijha, Yousef’s father, said: “The terrible memories still haunt us and will do for ever.” He added that Yousef’s mother Ghada Sakkijha “feels the weight of the loss of her son” every time she looks at their surviving child. “This company that did this to us won’t even feel the fine. It’s business as usual for them. Is that justice?” Arti Shah, a medical negligence solicitor at Fieldfisher, the firm representing the families of Yousef, Tameria and Oscar in civil proceedings, said: “For eight years, ITH Pharma has continued operating as normal. For eight years, Yousef’s parents have lived in hell. And still the company has not admitted causing Yousef’s death.” Tameria’s mother, Vicki Golden, and Oscar’s mother, Holly Barker, wept as the sentence was passed. An ITH Pharma spokesman said: “We at ITH Pharma, first and foremost, offer our deepest sympathies to the families of the patients affected by the events of eight years ago. “We accept the fine imposed by the court, having pleaded guilty to a single regulatory offence of failing to have a suitable and sufficient risk assessment, under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, and to two regulatory offences under the Medicines Act 1968 of supplying a medicinal product on 27 May 2014 not of the nature or quality specified in the prescription. “ITH Pharma has been a leading manufacturer of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and other medicinal products for many years and the events of 27 May 2014 were wholly exceptional.”",News/Society,ITH Pharma fined £1.2m after supplying contaminated baby feed,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/29/ith-pharma-fined-12m-after-supplying-contaminated-baby-feed

4/30/2022,"The definition of a gaffe is when a politician accidentally tells the truth. So ruled the veteran Washington journalist Michael Kinsley, who would surely take delight in the textbook example of the form served up on Thursday by Jacob Rees-Mogg, the satirically titled minister for Brexit opportunities. On a visit to the Eurotunnel terminal at Folkestone, hi-vis gilet over his double-breasted suit, Rees-Mogg announced that the government was delaying yet again the imposition of post-Brexit border checks on imports from the EU. He asked the public to celebrate this decision, on the grounds that it would save £1bn a year and help hard-pressed consumers by avoiding an increase in the cost of imported food. Enforcing post-Brexit checks, said the minister, “would have been an act of self-harm”. You read that right. Jacob Rees-Mogg, arch-leaver and longtime loather of the EU, is now parroting lines from the remain campaign. He is admitting that implementing Brexit in full, honouring the 2016 promise to take back control of Britain’s borders, would be “an act of self-harm”. There’s plenty to attack here, starting with the nerve of hailing this move as “saving” Britons £1bn, when this was £1bn that Britons would never have had to spend at all if it hadn’t been for Brexit. Or you could share the outrage of British farmers, appalled that, thanks to Brexit, they have been left at a serious competitive disadvantage: they now face onerous and costly checks when they ship their goods across the Channel, while French, Italian or Spanish farmers face no such hassle moving their products in the other direction. Or you could worry along with the British Veterinary Association, which warns that not checking food imports leaves Britain exposed to “catastrophic” animal diseases such as African swine fever – a risk that was reduced when Britain was part of “the EU’s integrated and highly responsive surveillance systems”. Or you could join the lament of the UK Major Ports Group, whose members have spent hundreds of millions of pounds building checking facilities, which now stand unused as “bespoke white elephants”. But put all that aside for a moment and grasp the full meaning of Rees-Mogg’s admission. He and his fellow Brexiters once looked forward to these border checks, seeing them not merely as a price worth paying for leaving the EU but as a genuine benefit. Britain would at last be free to set its own food standards, superior to the EU’s. And yet now the minister admits that putting up barriers just makes food more expensive for British consumers and risks bankrupting British farmers: precisely the act of self-harm remainers always said it would be. The irony of hearing Rees-Mogg declare that “free trade is hugely advantageous to consumers” after he and his comrades pulled us out of the largest, most successful free trade bloc in the world – the European single market – would be funny if it weren’t so bitter. At a stroke, the minister for Brexit opportunities has implicitly admitted that there are none – or, at the very least, any opportunities are outweighed by costs so great they represent economic self-mutilation. In the long story of Britain’s needless, pointless departure from the EU, the Rees-Mogg admission should count as a milestone. Which is not to say the Conservatives won’t keep banging the Brexit drum, hoping it will rally the electoral coalition it summoned back in 2019. But the sound, always hollow, will now be hollower still: thanks to Rees-Mogg, the Brexiters themselves have admitted as much. This matters not just as a twist in the Brexit saga but for the life expectancy of this government. For Brexit was this government’s founding purpose. When the best that even the loudest advocates for that project can promise is a delay in its realisation, it’s clear: the drive has gone. And without such a goal, a destination to aim for, governing parties drift and become vulnerable. If the two usual determinants of an incumbent administration’s popularity are the economy and the personal standing of the leader, those now combine dangerously for the Tories. The cost of living crisis is both deep and wide, reaching into families that had previously been getting by, albeit with a struggle. It’s the mother living off a tin of soup for herself so her children can eat; it’s the parent getting the kids to change into pyjamas when they get home from school, to avoid wearing out their uniforms. But this crisis runs in parallel with Partygate, each revelation of indulgence in Downing Street affronting not only those who followed the rules and denied themselves contact with loved ones during lockdown, but all those who do not have the money to put bread on the table, let alone pay for a suitcase full of booze. This is a Marie Antoinette government, pampering itself while too many of its people go hungry. The usual alibis are no longer working. The much trumpeted vaccine rollout is increasingly offset in the public mind both by Partygate and the handling of the first phase of the pandemic: witness this week’s high court ruling that discharging people from hospitals into care homes was “irrational” and unlawful. A new poll shows a sharp decline in the number of voters ready to forgive those early decisions just because they’re glad they got the jab. Nor does law and order any longer offer its traditional comfort to Conservatives, not when new figures show overall crime has increased by 18% in the past two years, with the proportion of those charged down to just 5.8%. On almost every issue, from inflation to immigration, tax to housing and the NHS, big majorities think the government is handling things badly. Only on defence and terrorism do the Tories get positive marks. No wonder they like to hail Boris Johnson as a leader on Ukraine, though that is of limited political value: most voters surely sense that today’s Labour party would not be doing anything different. In normal circumstances, you would say this spells doom for Johnson. He lags behind Labour and Keir Starmer on the two big ones: the economy and leadership. People are far worse off than they were, and they have lost all trust in him. His government is stripped of its defining purpose, leaving it exposed to daily squalls and scandal. And yet, while the evidence is strong that voters are making the break from this government, they are not yet fully sold on the alternative. The old line says it’s governments that lose elections, rather than oppositions that win them. But changing governments is a two-stage process: first, the electorate moves away from the incumbent party; then it moves towards the challenger. Labour and Starmer have work to do on that second stage. But the first phase is well under way – and Rees-Mogg’s accidental truth revealed one reason why.
