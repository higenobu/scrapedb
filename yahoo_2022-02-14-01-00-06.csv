2/14/2022,"Officials have launched an “inquiry” into an upcoming Florida fundraiser featuring Melania Trump for a charity that isn’t registered in the state, as is required by law, The New York Times reported Saturday, and it isn’t clear whether the charity even exists. Tickets are being sold to an “exclusive high tea” April 9 featuring the former first lady in Naples, Florida. According to information from Trump’s office, the tea will raise money for the charity Fostering the Future, which is described as an initiative of Be Best, the anti-bullying mission launched by Trump when she was living in the White House. Money is supposed to fund computer science scholarships to young people who have been in foster care, according to the ticket sales site. Tickets for a VIP table sponsor cost $50,000. Patron tickets are going for $3,000. But no such charity is registered in Florida, the Times reported. Nor does it appear to exist anywhere else. Officials at the Florida agency that oversees charity fundraising confirmed to the Times that there is no state registration of the charity, and they are investigating. “Consumer Services Division is currently investigating whether this event involves an entity operating in violation of Chapter 496, Florida Statutes,” Erin Moffet, an agency spokeswoman, said in a statement to the Times, referring to the state law requiring charities to register before soliciting money. There is a website called “Fostering the Future” for the nonprofit organization Children’s Rights Inc., which is located in New York City. It’s described in a charity form as “advocating on behalf of abused and neglected children.” There is no mention on its website of Melania Trump, Be Best or the upcoming Florida fundraiser. HuffPost could not immediately reach Children’s Rights for comment. There is also a Fostering the Future in Illinois, which exists on the internet only as a name on a donation site with no information about the organization. The charity tracking organization Charity Navigator also has little information about it. Responding to the Times story on Twitter, Melania Trump called it “dishonest reporting” by “corrupt media,” and said all documents are “in the works.” She also stated that “we are working” with the Bradley Impact Fund, a “donor-advised fund,” to “select charities that will receive the donations to foster children.” The statement sounds like the charities haven’t yet been picked, which appears to contradict the information on the ticket sales site for the high tea with Trump. The Bradley Impact Fund has been linked to organizations pushing Donald Trump’s lie that the 2020 presidential election he lost was rigged. Dishonest reporting at it again. Everything has been done lawfully, & all documents are in the works. Read with caution-typical corrupt media. We are working w/Bradley Impact Fund, a Donor-Advised Fund, to select charities that will receive the donations to foster children. https://t.co/5ZKr5SwIZz — MELANIA TRUMP (@MELANIATRUMP) February 12, 2022 In another recent high-profile money-raising effort, Melania Trump last month auctioned off an NFT collection on the Solana blockchain. The “Head of State Collection, 2022” — featuring the white hat she wore when she met the French president at the White House, a digital portrait and a print of it — sold for 1,800 SOL cryptocurrency ($170,000). But it appears she bought it herself — or it was purchased by whoever set up the deal for her — Vice and Artnet News reported. The Times story about the former first lady’s upcoming high tea also examined all the ways her husband is lining his pockets in his post-White House life. Read the full piece at The New York Times.

2/14/2022,"Trump aides instantly knew when the former president tore up documents, the Washington Post reported. His ripping style — clean tears horizontally and vertically — became so recognizable to aides. The former president is facing renewed scrutiny into the preservation of historical and important documents. Former Trump administration aides instantly knew when a document had been torn by the former president, according to a report from The Washington Post. Donald Trump had such a distinct style of ripping that became familiar to his aides, the Post reported. He would tear each document twice — once down the middle horizontally and once vertically — leaving the paper in four quarters. When the aides saw these documents torn up in this manner, according to the Post, they immediately knew Trump had done it. The former president would then leave the documents scattered across desks and in trash cans all over the White House, the Post reported. Documents were also strewn across floors, and aides found them in the Oval Office and aboard Air Force One, the report said. Scrutiny into the preservation of documents under the Trump administration started partly after New York Times correspondent Maggie Haberman revealed in a forthcoming book that the president had clogged a toilet by flushing torn pieces of paper down it. Trump, denied the report, slamming it as a ""fake story."" It's ""categorically untrue and simply made up by a reporter in order to get publicity for a mostly fictitious book,"" Trump said. Recently, the National Archives and Records Administration, a US agency responsible for the preservation and documentation of government and historical records, said Trump had taken several boxes of official White House records to his Mar-a-Lago resort upon vacating office. Under the Presidential Records Act, he should have turned the records over to the agency upon leaving office. In a statement from earlier this week, the agency said it has ""arranged"" transport for 15 boxes of documents from Mar-a-Lago. The items that Trump improperly took to Florida with him include correspondence from North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, with whom Trump said he exchanged ""beautiful"" love letters while in office, and a letter that former President Barack Obama left Trump in 2017, according to the Post. The National Archives has subsequently asked the Justice Department to investigate if Trump broke the law by doing so, the Post reported. Insider's Grace Panetta contributed to this report.

2/14/2022,"This Saturday was different. I woke up, again. I had it all planned out. From 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Drop daughter off at Girl Talk. Meet with men’s group to work on community initiative. Buy supplies for winter storm. Prioritize the honey-do list. Check in with my son who was at a sleepover. A well-set plan. It all changed with one call from my son. “Dad, my tire just popped!” I immediately sprang into action. My son needed me. My son, like many teenagers, has it all figured out, he believes. But we have not had the flat-tire scenario yet. It was time to have a teachable father-son moment. “I will be right there,” I told him. When I arrived, the car was leaning on the side of the road, definitely not the place to repair a tire. We needed to get it to flat ground. It was a fairly busy street with houses spread along the road here and there. My son slowly drove it to the first patch of land that was flat. To drive any further would mean much more damage to the car.

Park on a flat surface. Remove the tools from the trunk. Set up the jack. Use the lug wrench. Put the doughnut tire on the car. He was doing it and I was proud of him. The car started to rise from the turns of the jack. Then I woke up, again. We thought we were in a common area of grass along the road, but as it turns out it belonged to someone who did not look like us. Uh oh. I could see the man from the distance come out of his home. I thought he was going to check to see if everything was okay. More: Our View: NC A&T State is among underfunded land-grant HBCUs; state lawmakers should step up Instead he began to shout foul language to get off his property. I quickly responded and apologized and stated that my son had a flat tire and we were fixing as quickly as possible. To this he responded with even more foul language. He seemed to get more agitated and continued to scream as we lowered the car to move it further down the street. Then it happened. A gun shot. Up in the air. I guess he wanted us to move faster. I told my son to jump into my car and drive down the street, park and I would call him when I found a different location. The man, now joined by a lady, continued to yell obscenities and racial slurs from the porch with gun in hand. I continued to say that I was sorry while tossing things in the trunk, hoping not to lose anything including my life. I was both afraid, angry, confused and sad at the same time. This was supposed to be a lesson in how to change your first flat tire. Instead, it turned into a lesson about being a Black man. This was a reminder that there are some people who are just filled with hate and evil. This man was one of them. When I felt secure, I called my son back. As we finished, we started processing what had happened. Did this man just shoot a gun? Did he feel threatened? What could we have done differently? How bad is racial tension? Once he realized we were just changing a tire, shouldn’t that have made a difference? I spent the day in a fog. It was clear that it bothered me. The entire day was in slow motion. I began to calculate every step. Process every move. Slow down. I am angry that a flat tire on the side of the road is subject to a gunshot in the air. I am sad at people who take their anger and hatred for others to the grave. Dr. King once said, “Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.” Today I speak about what matters. I will continue to dedicate my life to mentoring young Black men.

2/14/2022,"Cotswold Airport in England bought a British Airways 747 for $1.35 and converted it into a ""party plane."" The aircraft, which features a dance floor and bar, costs $1,350 per hour to rent, or $16,000 for 24 hours. The airport has plans to get the TV screens working so it can host monthly cinema nights onboard. The iconic Boeing 747 jumbo jet has been an unfortunate casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic, with many airlines speeding up its retirement over the past two years. Boeing will stop making the 747 after more than 51 years of passenger flight. Here's the history of how the iconic plane changed the world. In 2020, British Airways sent its 747s to Cotswold Airport in England for storage, and the planes sat in rows until they were officially retired in October of the same year. Source: British Airways However, while most of the planes were sent to the junkyard to be disassembled, the airport did not want to let all of them go. So, Cotswold Airport CEO Suzannah Harvey asked the airline if she could keep one of the 747s and repurpose it to preserve the Queen of the Skies' legacy and beauty. The airline agreed and sold it to the airport for just £1 ($1.35). As part of the sale, Harvey explained to Insider that BA has entrusted the airport to maintain the aircraft ""as long as it is financially practical for the public use."" The 747 first joined the BA fleet in 1994 and operated 13,398 flights across nearly 60 million miles. It took its final flight from Miami to London Heathrow in April 2020. Source: British Airways The jumbo jet is one of four aircraft that feature BA's unique Negus paint job that was adorned in the 1970s and 1980s. The heritage livery was painted in 2019 to celebrate the company's 100th anniversary. The airport invested £500,000 ($676,655) to convert the jet into a ""party plane."" However, £200,000 ($271,000) of that was used to build a concrete slab that houses the massive plane. Source: CNN Onboard, guests will find the economy section has been transformed into a dance floor complete with lights, seating, and a DJ stand... …while the galleys have been turned in a bar. Meanwhile, the overhead bins and ceiling panels have been removed to reveal the fly-by-wire and inner workings of the aircraft. ""When you use the controls in the cockpit, that end actually has a physical effect by a wire on the 747s ailerons, flaps, etc., but nowadays it's all just computer,"" Harvey explained. ""So, it's very special."" Moreover, the lights have been rewired to replicate the original lighting system the aircraft had when it was on the ground, costing about £80,000 ($108,000). Source: CNN The rest of the plane has been kept completely intact, including the upper deck, Harvey said. However, she explained the airport initially intended to keep the inflight TVs working and do a monthly cinema screening onboard, but the systems have proven difficult. The screens are expected to be fixed in the next six months or so. While many aviation enthusiasts will want to enter the cockpit, Harvey told Insider that some of the systems are still operable, so no one will be able to touch the controls. However, a barrier will be put in the doorway so interested eyes can still see inside. According to Harvey, the plane's event space is intended for things like weddings and she is getting dozens of inquiries a day. ""We're getting everything from big car manufacturers to individual birthday parties,"" she said. Although the 747 is built for entertainment and events, its use is versatile. Recently, the plane was used for a hijacking scene for a movie, Harvey told Insider. However, she explained that unless given permission by the airline, BA's livery will need to be edited out of the film to protect the company's brand. Despite the hefty renovations, there is one part of the plane that has been particularly difficult to get operational — the toilets. ""They are designed to work like a vacuum when the aircraft is pressurized, so it's something we'll look at at a later date,"" she said. ""For now, we have a really posh little loo block outside, which does the job for the time being."" For those wanting to book the space for a wedding, it'll cost £12,000 ($16,200) for 24-hours, including set up and break down times. The regular hourly rate is £1,000 ($1,350). Harvey said the interest in the aircraft is exciting and she expects the investment will pay itself back over a couple of years. Moreover, part of the money earned will be put into the airport's annual scholarship program and to pay for students' private pilot licenses. ""Every year we take on 10 kids for about two weeks and they get some flight training and get to go to Rolls-Royce, Airbus, and some of the military bases nearby to see all the different aspects of aviation careers they could do,"" she said.

2/14/2022,"MANILA (Reuters) - The son and namesake of late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos strengthened his lead over his closest rival ahead of the presidential election in May, results of a new poll released on Sunday showed. Ferdinand Marcos Jr garnered a 44-point lead over Philippine Vice President Leni Robredo in the Jan. 19-24 survey by independent pollster Pulse Asia, an 11-point increase compared with the previous poll in early December. A total of 2,400 respondents were asked to pick their first choice for president and vice president if the election were held during the survey period, with 60% expressing preference for Marcos, while 16% chose Robredo. In the December poll with the same sample size, Marcos was on top with 53% compared to Robredo's 20%. Boxing superstar Manny Pacquiao and Manila city mayor Francisco Domagoso trailed, each getting 8%, while Senator Panfilo Lacson took 4%. In the Philippines, the president and vice president are elected separately. Marcos' running mate, Sara Duterte-Carpio, the daughter of incumbent President Rodrigo Duterte, remained the top choice for vice president, taking a 21-point lead over her closest rival, Senate President Vicente Sotto. The latest Pulse Asia survey was conducted before the Philippines' Commission on Elections last week dismissed a series of complaints seeking to disqualify Marcos, removing a major hurdle for him in the May 9 contest. The complaint's petitioners have vowed to challenge the decision and can appeal to the Supreme Court. The election body also rejected a complaint seeking the cancellation of Marcos' certificate of candidacy. As frontrunner, Marcos appears poised to complete a remarkable rebranding of the family name 36 years after a ""people power"" uprising ended his father's autocratic rule.
