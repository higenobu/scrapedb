5/16/2022,"A Greek helicopter pilot who claimed he killed his British wife, Caroline Crouch, 20, in a fit of anger following a row that had “blurred” his senses, has been found guilty of murder at the end of a trial watched closely in Greece and abroad. The seven-member mixed tribunal of judges and jurors concluded unanimously that Babis Anagnostopoulos was culpable of premeditated murder, and perverting the course of justice. The 34-year-old UK-trained aviator, who had staged a break-in in an attempt to cover up the crime – a line of defence he maintained for nearly six weeks – was expressionless as the verdict was announced. Under Greek law he is likely to receive a 20-year prison term – the maximum sentence under Greek law. Prior to the verdict being announced, the public prosecutor, Eugenia Stathopoulou, said all the facts pointed to the murder being cold-blooded and pre-planned. Stathopoulou told the court that Anagnostopoulos had suffocated his wife with a pillow while lying on top of her during an unprovoked attack while she was asleep.",News/UK news,Greek helicopter pilot found guilty of killing British wife Caroline Crouch,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/greek-helicopter-pilot-who-killed-british-wife-caroline-crouch-guilty
5/16/2022,"When America’s founders sat down to craft the structure of their brand new British spin-off, the preamble to the US constitution described the purpose of this experiment in democracy – to create a “more perfect union”. The 14th amendment, which ended slavery, gave Black Americans more freedom while simultaneously spawning the imperfections of Jim Crow and a need for a civil rights movement. While this foundational goal of a more perfect union has served as a mission statement for some and an excuse for others, the rights of most Americans have gradually expanded. For the most part, America has slowly moved forward. We are currently not in the most part. On Saturday, an 18-year-old white supremacist traveled more than 200 miles to target Black residents of Buffalo, New York, in an attack inspired by the “great replacement theory” – the increasingly popular notion that America’s white majority is being intentionally replaced by a multiracial, multi-ethnic population. While more Americans are becoming aware of the theory, it is not new. It is the same concept that once made interracial marriage illegal, spawned Jim Crow and motivated southern segregationists to switch to the Republican party. At its foundation lies the desperate attempt to preserve and maintain control based on nothing more than being born into whiteness. It is about white power. Unfortunately (for the white majority), the only way to preserve white power is to stop moving forward. It is easy to frame a lone gunman’s brazen act of lawlessness and the fear-mongering ethnonationalism that produced it as a prototypical but rare act of white supremacy. But that narrative obscures a variety of legally sanctioned acts of violence inflicted upon America’s non-white populace every day. The fight to create a less perfect union isn’t just reflected in white extremist terrorism and Fox News’s primetime lineup. It is an all-encompassing strategy bent on rewinding progress to a time when whiteness was synonymous with purity and perfection. Not since Reconstruction has this country so blatantly sought to reverse progress and strip away the most fundamental rights, including the right to vote, a woman’s right to control her body, and even the right to exist as a full and equal human being. The leaked brief detailing the US supreme court’s draft ruling to overturn a woman’s right to choose is another expression of this great American moonwalk. If true, the institution that once decided that Black people “have no rights which the white man was bound to respect” will soon hand over the authority to decide whether or not women must carry a pregnancy to full term to 50 separate overwhelmingly white, male-dominated state legislatures. The goal is to weaponize whiteness at the expense of everyone else’s freedom in the hopes of protecting white sovereignty. Florida governor Ron DeSantis has become the Republican party’s newest cause celebre by pushing legislation that makes the American education system less perfect by criminalizing critical race theory and antiracist literature. By painting Black history as a “woke agenda” that could turn white babies into progressive thinkers, Republicans don’t have to worry about their children’s past being erased by the fragility of the majority. At worse, the pro-racist movement has simply condemned their children to the same uninformed-but-palatable potion that has always aided America’s ability to stomach the sins of the past. For them, learning the truth of American-style racism is too treacherous a step forward. Still, this erasure confirms the essential premise of white supremacy: Black children’s history is less important than white children’s comfort. Though we may all bemoan the rise of Trump-style authoritarianism, the end of democracy is theoretical only to white voters. For Black voters, it is a return to the imperfect past. In a country where Black voters wait longer, travel further and are less likely to have their vote counted, 19 states have more restrictive voting laws – nearly all of which will disproportionately affect the Black electorate. Studies, investigations and judicial rulings have concluded that the specific intent of voter ID laws, poll closures and gerrymandering is to restrict access for voters of color. In September, three North Carolina judges ruled that the state’s photo ID law “was motivated at least in part by an unconstitutional intent to target African American voters”. Yet in February, the supreme court reversed a lower court ruling that required Alabama to redraw its congressional districts. The justices didn’t disagree with the lower court’s assessment that “Black voters have less opportunity than other Alabamians to elect candidates of their choice to Congress”, they simply decided that redrawing the maps would confuse voters and burden the state legislators. Again, the court essentially determined that the comfort of white voters is more important than Black voters’ political will. Perhaps there is no better metaphor for the concept of white supremacy. And I know what you’re thinking. But what happened in Buffalo – while tragic – is not an example of white supremacy. White supremacy is not defined by the outlandish violence that enraptures racial extremists. This white domestic terrorism is the result of the belief that white people are entitled to the superior position that they enjoyed for most of this country’s history. While becoming a more perfect union has always been our publicly stated goal, the US has always been engaged in the preservation of white power. But that started at a time when the slaveowners and slavery apologists who penned America’s founding document couldn’t possibly fathom the idea that white men wouldn’t have perpetual possession of America’s reins. When they said “we the People”, they meant “white people”. They just want to make sure it stays that way. But I understand … Nobody’s perfect.

5/16/2022,"The UK is saying it will have to take unilateral action to override part of the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol unless the EU shows the “requisite flexibility”. The EU has said it believes a deal can be done but only through negotiation. So what are the differences between the two sides and is the latest row more about politics than substance? Talks between officials have been ongoing since March 2021 when David Frost took the unilateral decision to extend the grace period for checks on goods including supermarket food. They came close to collapse in June and again in November when Lord Frost repeatedly threatened to invoke article 16 and walk away from the negotiating table. He quit in December with the baton handed to Liz Truss, and talks continued with optimism that a new and less combative approach by the foreign secretary would yield results after an initial “constructive” meeting at Chevening, the foreign secretary’s grace and favour home. Yes, the UK took a new approach in December, conceding a phased deal was more practical separating trade barrier issues from the trickier problem of the role of the European court of justice (ECJ). It envisaged an interim deal easing checks on the Irish Sea in March, before the pre-election period in Northern Ireland kicked in. But Russia invaded Ukraine and talks, other than exchanges between civil servants, went into cold storage. They were about to restart but are now mired in a row over unilateral action. As one source said: “It’s like the UK has turned back the clock.” Last week Truss published a list of seven demands: Removal of checks on British sausages and other chilled meats. She also cited barriers to the supply of “Thai green curry ready meals, New Zealand lamb and Brazilian pork”. Removal of customs declarations for parcel post, which would mean the restoration of online shopping for some of the big high street chains that have stopped delivering to Northern Ireland. Removal of veterinary certificates for pets travelling from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK. Ability to control the VAT rate in Northern Ireland. Truss complained that the protocol means some VAT cuts, including the relief on energy bills, which apply in the rest of the UK cannot be applied in Northern Ireland because of the protocol. Removal of the European court of justice as the arbiter in disputes. A green lane and red lane at ports to distinguish between goods destined for Northern Ireland and those travelling onward into the Republic of Ireland and the single market. Last October the EU unveiled four papers covering what it described as “far-reaching” proposals to address the UK’s concerns. It offered to do away with the sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks on chilled meats with a new “national identity” exemption for British sausages and other goods destined for Northern Irish supermarkets. It offered a “bespoke solution” it claimed would get rid of 80% of the SPS checks on food. In exchange the UK would have to complete the construction of border controls and ensure a new “for Northern Ireland” labelling system. It offered to reduce customs declarations by 50%. It offered an “express lane” out of ports for goods destined for Northern Ireland only. It offered an “enhanced” role for Stormont, business and civic stakeholders in the implementation of the protocol including attendance at meetings of specialised committees charged with overseeing the operation of the protocol. An uninterrupted supply of medicines was offered. Yes. In December the EU announced changes, agreed with member states, allowing medicines, including new cancer treatments, to be authorised under national UK procedures. In June it announced changes to the protocol to ensure live animals for breeding would be able to move freely from GB to NI. Sausages and chilled meats Chances appear strong for a deal on some SPS checks, ending controls on British sausages and chilled meats. There is little chance of a deal on composite foods such as the “Thai green curry ready meals” that do not meet the rules of origin standard that require mostly EU sources ingredients. And meat from outside the EU will be considered a disease control risk. However, as the UK has long agreed the island of Ireland is one epidemiological unit, the latter demand may be dropped in a compromise scenario. Wider SPS checks Compromise is needed here. The EU has said if the UK agreed to alignment on EU rules on animal and plant products, the checks could be eliminated. However, London had in the past ruled this “Swiss style” agreement out as it would mean the UK having to follow EU rules. It has also said it would pose a barrier to future trade deals where the UK may want to deviate on pesticide and antibiotic or hormone standards. The EU has even suggested a temporary deal, reviewable if a big trade deal emerged. Green and red lanes A deal here is highly likely, with the UK seeking green and red lanes at ports and the EU offering “express” lanes. Customs declarations and parcels The EU has offered to slash paperwork by 50% but there appears to be a disagreement on what that looks like, making a deal less likely. Before quitting, Frost said it was misleading as it was merely a reduction in 50% of the boxes on customs forms. Governance and the ECJ The EU will not budge on the role of the ECJ. However, the UK softened its position in December that the court should be eliminated from dispute resolution entirely. Instead it believes an arbitration proposal in the wider withdrawal agreement – which allows disputes to be settled in the political arena in the first instance – could work in the Northern Ireland context. There is room for manoeuvre here.",News/Politics,Brexit protocol row: what are the issues dividing UK and EU?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/16/brexit-protocol-row-what-issues-dividing-uk-eu-northern-ireland
5/16/2022,"The vast majority of the UK’s 475,000-odd civil servants are sick of political psychodrama, and don’t care exactly when Boris Johnson decides to scuttle off into the gilded obscurity of the panel comedy shows, neoliberal speaking circuits and biography discount bins that are his natural habitat. But we do care about the damage his necrotic and bullying period of misrule threatens to wreak on public services, and the kind of country he seems intent on creating. The omens aren’t good: we woke up on Saturday to a fawning interview in the Daily Mail, which confirmed Johnson’s incendiary plans to fix the cost of living crisis by cutting civil service numbers by a fifth, down to levels last seen in 2016. On my own patch, attempting to cut 20% of the workforce without a monumental and carefully designed change management programme would be a cluster bourach. Working from home accelerated the rollout of a lot of collaborative tools, and dealing with both Brexit and the pandemic has given us a lot of experience in working across silos to get things done. The minister I work for happens to be an actual human being, but my department is already struggling with its workload even after many of those efficiencies – what management wonks insist on calling “low-hanging fruit” – have already been found and priced in. There’s no question that cutting one in five of us would have a devastating impact on public services. Dismayed tweets and WhatsApp messages have flown around the civil service over the weekend in response to the announcement, which was also condemned by union leaders as dishonest, unrealistic and vindictive. This includes Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union, who has asked why Johnson seems to be behaving like P&O Ferries by announcing job cuts through the media. Several explanations have already been floated. Perhaps he has an actual short-term plan to slash the workforce without somehow also decimating public services. Or maybe these are the first drops of the “hard rain” of civil service reform super-predicted by Dominic Cummings. Or it could be a “dead cat”, in other words a ploy to create headlines to displace #Partygate and other scandals from the front pages. I don’t believe any of these are correct. First, Jacob Rees-Mogg has insisted – in a voice originally evolved to cut through the cries of sobbing factory workers – that a 20% cut is a “perfectly reasonable” way of “trying to get back to normal”. What normal? A full pandemic recovery, an already creaking system, and the still-unfolding Brexit shitshow surely require a reimagining of what normal even looks like. Remember those thousands of extra civil servants needed to take on new trade negotiation tasks previously subcontracted to the EU? We still need them, because those tasks are, according to the Institute for Government’s Jill Rutter, a “permanent increase in scope”. Second, no minister seems to have a clue about how, where or exactly when cuts of those magnitude would be made. When challenged on this on Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday, the Moggster mumbled vaguely about efficiencies and seemed to suggest that cutting Passport Office staff would somehow fix its backlog. No mention of the fact that civil service efficiency has been a decades-long project occupying Labour, coalition and Conservative governments. This includes, by the way, Rishi Sunak’s plans to cut numbers by 5% to pre-pandemic levels as part of last year’s spending review. Third, while the “dead cat” theory has seduced the likes of rebel-lite Tory MP Tobias Ellwood into suspecting the sticky paws of a Dead Cat Committee – not even Larry, No 10’s resident mouser, believes that. Because this isn’t a distracting side-show; there is clear evidence that this is part of the main event. In December 2020, I wrote about the multipronged campaign of civil service harassment pursued by this government, which escalated in the run-up to Brexit, when “remoaner” civil servants were thrown under the bus as soon as it became obvious that Vote Leave’s promises could not possibly be delivered. That campaign has never stopped. So when ministers frame £3.75bn of job cuts (which sound reassuringly large to voters but are utterly dwarfed by the hundreds of billions lost to PPE fraud, pandemic loan fraud and Brexit itself) as unlocking a significant tax cut, they are using a well-worn tactic: to divide, conquer, and create what Moya Lothian-McLean calls a miasma of mistrust. It is a pattern; part of a long-term assault that this government is waging – in plain sight – on our institutions, including the judiciary, public broadcasters, “lefty lawyers” and electoral democracy itself. To believe that Johnson’s intention to cut 91,000 jobs is a dead cat or the result of daring policy thinking or an example of his reforming zeal is therefore to give him far too much credit. What his government is doing isn’t ideological or even political in the traditional sense, given the absence of any project other than staying in power. It’s too easy to make fun of Rees-Mogg, the honourable member for the 18th century, as if Bozzymandias and his morale-crushing workhouse prefect are unaware of the growing evidence that flexibility and productivity go hand in hand – the truth is that they simply don’t care. These cuts may never happen, because they aren’t really the point; they are yet another trial balloon designed to test the public’s acceptance of the continuing expansion of the culture wars that Johnson continues to rely on for his survival. For now, civil servants will continue to get on with the job, and we’ll hope Penman and his colleagues can keep reminding the public that the average civil servant earns less than £30K, doesn’t work in Whitehall and doesn’t drag suitcases of prosecco into the office. We aren’t idlers: in fact, we’ve never worked harder or more effectively, or at such personal cost. This proves that, unlike our morally incontinent prime minister, civil servants can be trusted to do the right thing even when someone isn’t looking over our shoulders.

5/16/2022,"Despite the title, this isn’t exactly a profile of John Toshack, Liverpool’s towering centre forward of 70s vintage. It’s in fact a likable, nostalgia-fuelled recap of his first, and arguably most improbable, achievement after he became a manager: getting Swansea City from the Fourth Division to the First in double-quick time between 1978 and 1981. Toshack, now talking in avuncular fashion from retirement in Mallorca, went on to bigger things with Real Madrid and the Welsh national side, but his vertigo-inducing ride up the Football League is still fondly remembered four decades later – not least by the grizzled collection of Toshack’s former players who talk about it like it happened only a few weeks ago, and can’t really believe it. Director Pete Jones does a pretty decent job of compensating for the fact that this all happened in the pre Sky Sports era, when archive footage of lower-division games is largely nonexistent. The film makes up for it with homespun charm: it disinters topics as varied as Dolly the catering manager, the team holiday in Magaluf as they neared promotion, and the type size of the headline in the local paper once they got there. One of Toshack’s managerial masterstrokes turned out to be the importation of further Liverpool legends, including Tommy Smith and Ian Callaghan (and later Ray Kennedy) who together turbocharged Swansea’s run, but this is not simply a case of buying success: the core of the squad were local boys who played throughout the charge up the league. (One case in point was striker Alan Curtis, who was nabbed by Leeds in 1979, but who returned to Swansea in time for their epic 1980-81 promotion push that saw them make it to the top division.) It all adds to the emotional, misty-eyed atmosphere of the film, a tribute to football’s less complicated days. It would perhaps have been ungallant for the film to mention Swansea’s swift descent back down the league (Toshack left in 1984 shortly before they were relegated back to the Third Division), or the heavy spending on players that led the club to being wound up in 1985. (Neither does Wimbledon’s similarly fast Fourth to First rise get a nod, but possibly this would have ruined the mood.) Nevertheless, this is a fascinating glimpse into a football world that has entirely vanished, for better or worse.

5/16/2022,"Chelsea could join the race to sign Robert Lewandowski despite the Bayern Munich forward favouring a summer move to Barcelona. Lewandowski’s future is up in the air after he made clear he was unwilling to extend his deal with Bayern, which expires in the summer of 2023. The Poland international has long been interested in playing in Spain and sources have indicated that he has verbally agreed a three-year deal with Barça, who are working to sign him. Bayern insist that Lewandowski is not for sale and that they will keep him until his contract is up, raising the prospect of one of the best strikers leaving the German champions on a free transfer. It remains to be seen whether Bayern decide it would be best to receive a fee for the 33-year-old. There have been claims they are reluctant to sell to Barcelona because the Nou Camp club are emerging from a difficult financial period and could struggle to pay a figure appropriate for a player of Lewandowski’s stature. Barça have told the former Borussia Dortmund striker’s camp that they can afford him. If negotiations between the clubs remain difficult, Lewandowski’s hopes of moving to Spain would be dim. Real Madrid are not an option. Madrid have Karim Benzema and are pushing to sign Kylian Mbappé from Paris Saint-Germain. Lewandowski, who helped Bayern win the Champions League in 2020, could yet be forced to consider the Premier League. He has been unsure about playing in England but it is understood that Chelsea are paying close attention to the situation. Thomas Tuchel is a huge admirer of Lewandowski, who has scored 343 goals since joining Bayern in 2014, and would have loved to bring him to Chelsea last summer. Lewandowski was considered off limits last year and Chelsea ended up buying Romelu Lukaku. The Belgian has struggled since his £97.5m move from Internazionale, even though he has 15 goals this season, and produced a lethargic display when Tuchel’s side lost Saturday’s FA Cup final to Liverpool. Chelsea’s chances of signing Lewandowski are slim at the moment. The club cannot buy or sell players until Todd Boehly’s consortium purchases the club from Roman Abramovich. It will then be fascinating to see how much Chelsea are capable of spending. They will need to devote funds towards sorting out their defence, with Andreas Christensen joining Barcelona and Antonio Rüdiger heading to Madrid. Much will also depend on what happens with Lukaku. The striker does not appear to suit Chelsea’s system but his agent, Federico Pastorello, last week dismissed suggestions of the Belgian joining Inter or Milan. It would be financially challenging for an Italian club to sign Lukaku. If there is a solution, though, then Tuchel will want Chelsea to be in the running for Lewandowski.",Sport/Football,Chelsea have Robert Lewandowski on radar despite favoured Barcelona move,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/chelsea-have-robert-lewandowski-on-radar-despite-favoured-barcelona-move

5/16/2022,"Americans are facing another tragedy – this time in Buffalo – as 11 Black and two white victims were shot in a “racially motivated hate crime” suspected to have been perpetrated by a young man who spent much of his life online, where he appears to have been radicalised. He used the same digital playbook as the Christchurch terrorist: livestream footage of his attack and a “manifesto” that quoted the same “great replacement” and other white supremacist theories. He mentions the Christchurch terrorist by name in his manifesto. In our most recent research report looking at anti-Muslim hate, we found that the big social media companies were collectively failing to act on 89% of posts that advocated the great replacement theory – despite pledges made in the wake of the Christchurch terrorist attack and subsequent, ideologically driven violent extremism attacks at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh; in Halle, Germany; and in El Paso. These are not “lone wolf” attacks. The individuals are connected through online communities on social media, where they share ideas, tactics and content. In a joint statement in 2019, Meta, Twitter and Google committed to uphold the Christchurch Call to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online. They stated that they would be “resolute in [their] commitment to ensure [they] are doing all [they] can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence”. The failure of social media companies to act sufficiently on known racist content connected with terrorism is a violation of their own terms and conditions, the pledges made to an international community when the cameras were rolling, and the dignity that the victims of Buffalo were entitled to have – the right to life. Social media and online spaces are often where people meet, seek information and become radicalised through a rabbit-hole of lies, hate and misinformation. Those with fringe beliefs will be exposed to increasingly more radical content as a result of recommendation algorithms. The failure of social media giants to effectively tackle online hate and misinformation has real-world impacts. Words can kill. Perhaps the only thing that explains why – despite so many pledges, so many platitudes and commitments to voluntary frameworks – the social media platforms have failed to act is because of the memo that Andrew Bosworth, now chief technical officer of Meta, wrote to his fellow employees on their internal messaging board, called the Ugly Truth. In it he said: “So we connect more people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack co-ordinated on our tools. And still we connect people.” It is, quite simply, a bald statement of personal indifference to the grief of people, families and our nations. It is time for governments to act – much as they are doing with the online safety bill in the United Kingdom and the Digital Services Act in the European Union – to increase safety, transparency and democratic accountability, and ensure that the responsibility for harm is borne by social media companies, not just by our societies. The holdout remains the US, where there is no real urgency to the debate beyond flaccid claims that one side or another is being “cancelled”. The grim, inevitable, reductive, partisan politicisation of yet another important debate has slowed progress, and yet it has become impossibly clear, after 6 January 2021, after pandemic misinformation claimed tens of thousands of American lives, and now, after Buffalo, that if we leave things to social media companies, people all around the world will suffer.

5/16/2022,"Many were shocked by the images of Israeli border police attacking the funeral procession of the prominent Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Aqleh – not merely by the police’s cruelty, but also by their willingness to ride out the reputational damage from the attack. Abu Aqleh’s killing, likely by an Israeli sniper, the subsequent raid on her family home and the police’s intimidation of her brother prior to her funeral all point to the growing sense of impunity among Israel’s decision-makers and military. Israel’s leadership had promised the Biden administration that the funeral of Abu Aqleh would be “respectful”. They are likely displeased with the viral videos showing policemen attempting to tear the Palestinian flags from Abu Aqleh’s coffin while beating pallbearers with clubs, causing her coffin to almost fall to the ground. Yet the country’s leadership has not faced any international repercussions for its actions in the occupied territories in years. In his meek statements concerning the assault on the funeral, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, described Israeli forces as “intruding into the funeral procession”, as if they were merely uninvited guests. Israel can count on international inaction, while any steps to discipline the policemen or hold to account the sniper who shot Abu Aqleh, who was wearing a vest clearly indicating that she was a journalist, will open the government to attack from the Israeli right. For over a decade, the near-total disappearance of the Israeli left has meant that political competition of any consequence comes from within Israel’s rightwing bloc. Together with the growing strength of Israel’s far right (bolstered by former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu), this has led mainstream politicians to move further to the right in order to avoid losing support among their base. Israel’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett, and Netanyahu have tried at all costs to avoid appearing soft on the Israeli security forces, no matter their crimes. In 2016, after the Israeli soldier Elor Azaria was caught on camera killing an incapacitated Palestinian attacker in Hebron, Netanyahu initially condemned his actions. Later, after seeing poll results, he reversed his position and called for Azaria to be pardoned. Azaria ended up serving merely nine months in military prison. After his release, he became a major celebrity in rightwing circles. Policemen caught on camera beating journalists in Jersualem, or soldiers involved in the detention of an elderly Palestinian-American man, who was bound, gagged and blindfolded, and who died shortly afterwards from an apparent heart attack, have not been tried. These well-known cases of impunity are not an aberration. Data collected by the Israeli human rights NGO Yesh Din shows that only 0.7% of complaints filed by Palestinians against soldiers lead to prosecutions, while 80% of cases are closed without a criminal investigation. Israeli servicemen have no reason to expect they will face any repercussions for killing a journalist or attacking her funeral, broadcast live around the world. Before Abu Aqleh’s funeral, the Israeli police warned her family to avoid the event turning into a protest, a clear attempt to demonstrate Israeli dominance. It’s not the first time the Israeli leadership and military have attempted to do this: earlier this year, the leadership allowed Jewish worshippers to ascend to the Temple Mount/ Haram al-Sharif and pray there, violating a previous agreement with the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf religious trust and Jordan. In 2017, in another show of force, Israel installed metal detectors at the entrances to the al-Aqsa mosque. Mass riots led Israel to back down and remove them several weeks later. During the month of Ramadan, Israeli policemen prevented Palestinians from sitting near the Damascus Gate, a popular communal space, and carried out mass arrests of those who did. Recently, Shin Bet sent text messages to Palestinians whose phones were triangulated to the al-Aqsa mosque, threatening them with revenge for supposedly participating in riots. The Israeli police’s violent attempts to remove Palestinian flags hoisted during Abu Aqleh’s funeral are merely the latest manifestation of a policy that aims to squash signs of Palestinian identity in Jersualem. In 2018, the Israeli government allocated 2 billion shekels (£480m) to “increase Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem”, with a focus on getting more schools to switch from teaching the Jordanian curriculum to the Israeli one. Israeli authorities forced the few schools in the city that still teach the Palestinian curriculum to censor textbooks discussing Palestinian history. Earlier this year, Israeli policemen arrested Palestinian students at Hebrew University in Jerusalem for singing what the police claimed were nationalistic Palestinian songs. The killing of Abu Aqleh and the brutalisation of her mourners has surely caused Israel reputational damage. But unless international disapproval results in tangible political change, Israel’s leadership has no reason to stop other abuses in the future. Its leaders are focused on appeasing a rightwing base that demands nothing short of full-throated support to Israel’s security forces. As long as Israel’s allies continue to tolerate these abuses, impunity will remain the rule, not the exception.
