2/6/2022,"A major Tory party supporter is demanding the repayment of £200,000 in donations after complaining that he was excluded from elite political events and was never given auction prizes he had bid for at fundraising dinners, including breakfast with Boris Johnson. Telecoms businessman Mohamed Amersi paid £50,000 for membership of Tory donor club the Leader’s Group in December 2020. But he says he was excluded from the invitation list for high-level events last year, and that officials were instructed not to invite him to the party’s winter ball last November.  He says he also paid £150,000 for auction prizes he never received, including the breakfast with the prime minister, a Japanese meal with Jeremy Hunt and a “magical show” by former defence secretary Penny Mordaunt, who once worked as a magician’s assistant. Emails and documents regarding Amersi’s donation reveal how anxious officials in Conservative headquarters were to secure his support. One note even proposed he be helped in his ambition to become chair of the National Lottery Community Fund, a £40,000-a-year post for which he had been shortlisted. Amersi said this weekend that while the donation system appears to offer a “leg up” to donors, it needs an overhaul to bring more transparency. He said he had been failed by party officials who had not fulfilled their obligations. Amersi, 61, said this weekend: “You would expect [what is arguably] the oldest political party in the world would treat a significant donor with courtesy and respect. If for any reason they felt they could not fulfil any of the promises, they could have said ‘can we write you a cheque and give you your money back?’ Instead, they’ve not given me my money back and didn’t invite me to any events.” A legal letter seen by the Observer and sent to Ben Elliot, co-chair of the Conservative party and co-founder of the concierge company Quintessentially, is the latest sally in a year-long dispute involving Amersi and other party figures over a new Conservatives’ friends of the Middle East group, which he chairs. Amersi’s lawyers warn that unless the dispute is amicably settled, officials should set out proposals for reimbursing his donations and other costs. Amersi believes one of the reasons for his exclusion is that he exposed the “access capitalism” he alleges Elliot presides over, in which he claims privileged relationships are extended to those who make hefty donations. His business dealing in Russia and an advisory role on a deal in Uzbekistan also faced scrutiny last year, but he denies any wrongdoing and a report on him by party officials did not flag any significant concerns. Amersi has donated more than £500,000 to the Conservative party since 2018 and, at a fundraising dinner at the Carlton Club in London in November 2019, he successfully bid £100,000 for breakfast with Johnson. He says he paid £50,000 for other prizes, including the meal with Hunt and the show with Mordaunt which he bid for in February 2019 at the annual Black and White ball at Battersea Evolution in London. According to internal documents obtained by the Observer, Tory officials were anxious in December 2020 that Amersi renew his membership of the Leader’s Group, which requires a minimum donation of £50,000 and gives access to events with senior Tories, including the prime minister. “Amersi is very interested in the Lottery Fund chairmanship and certainly has the skills,” said one redacted email sent on 21 December 2020 from a parliamentary email address to a party official. “I know you work with the public appointments team. Can we see that he is at least considered for the role.” It was agreed in the email correspondence that there would be efforts “to get the progress Mohamed deserves”. Amersi had in fact been interviewed for the role the previous month after being shortlisted by the public appointments team, but was told a final decision would not be made until the new year. He said he had been shortlisted on his merits and was not aware of any help from the Conservative party. On 22 December, Mike Chattey, head of fundraising for the party, said Amersi had agreed to join the Leader’s Group. Amersi said, in an email sent the same day, that he hoped, given his background and qualifications, that the party would support his application to be chair of the National Lottery Community Fund, and for a group that he led, Comena, the Conservative Friends of the Middle East and North Africa, to be affiliated with the party. He stressed that this support was neither conditional nor “transactional” and said it was “great to be part of the family again”. In the event, the lottery role was given to a prominent lawyer, Blondel Cluff. In late 2020, a “due diligence” note was compiled on Amersi by former Tory MP Charlotte Leslie, who is director of the Conservative Middle East Council, a separate group from the one Amersi had been working on. The memo gave details of Amersi’s past, his associates and his dealings with Russia. The note was reportedly sent to party officials in January 2021 and triggered a flurry of emails. Amersi said he considered the note defamatory. There were concerns about “blue on blue” conflict in the party, and it was suggested in one email that Amersi be kicked “into the very long grass”. It was also proposed that a detailed report be conducted on his background. But there was no hesitancy over taking his cash. Amersi’s £50,000 Leader’s Group donation was accepted on 18 January 2021. The pandemic caused initial delays in arranging the breakfast with Johnson, and officials also wanted to ensure he was properly vetted before any meeting. One No 10 official wrote in April 2021: “He’s a massive donor, just want to know if it’s likely to blow up into something if we do a breakfast.” By 25 August 2020, a vetting report by the Conservative research department had concluded that the party’s close links to Amersi were “fine to proceed, with minor concerns”. The six-page report said he had international business interests, with some evidence of involvement with tax havens, but it did not flag any significant issues. In the summer of last year Amersi had lifted the lid on how Elliot provided wealthy benefactors with privileged access to the highest ranks of the Conservative party and even access to Prince Charles. Amersi paid £15,000 a year for membership of Elliot’s concierge business, Quintessentially. It was also reported last October that he had advised on the structure of a deal that was later found to be a $220m (£162m) bribe for the daughter of the then president of Uzbekistan. Amersi’s lawyers said others had done due diligence on the deal and he had no reason to believe it might be a bribe. Amersi says he is now effectively frozen out of the party’s “inner circle”, despite passing its vetting checks, and think his revelations about Elliot’s operations are probably to blame. The businessman is now taking legal action against Leslie over the note on his background and has been criticised in parliament for using the court to try to “bully” her into silence. He says he wants to vindicate his reputation, but his efforts at reaching a settlement and avoiding a costly legal battle have been unsuccessful. Amersi says Elliot reneged on an agreement for Comena to be affiliated to the party. Amersi said last week he did not consider Elliot fit to be party co-chair: “You cannot ask donors for support, expect them to purchase auction prizes, keep their money and then, like rubbish collectors, consign them to the wastepaper bin.” Lawyers acting for the Conservative party are understood to have notified Amersi’s legal team that they consider his potential claim “legally unmeritorious”. The Observer submitted questions to the Conservative party on Saturday afternoon, but officials have not yet commented on the matter.",News/Politics,"Give me back my £200,000, major donor tells Tories",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/05/give-me-back-my-200000-major-donor-tells-tories
2/6/2022,"Emma Hayes and Gareth Taylor, managers of Chelsea and Manchester City, echoed each other as they prepared for the teams’ meeting at Kingsmeadow on Sunday by calling for an expansion of the Women’s Super League. Both made the appeal for an increase from 12 teams unprompted and off the back of conversations about just how exciting the title race is this season. “For the neutral it’s exciting, especially when you have these types of fixtures at the weekend,” said Taylor, also referring to the game between Arsenal and third-placed Manchester United on Saturday. “It just goes to show that the levels are improving in the WSL and if we were able to ever get to add a few more teams into it, to make the competition more than 22 games in a season, I think you would see really different types of results on a more consistent basis.”  Hayes said: “I wish the season was longer. I want it to go to 14 teams. I want more games, that’s the next step for our league.” For the first time in a while the title race is wide open with less than half a season remaining. No team has looked unbeatable. Of the traditional top three, City racked up four defeats as they struggled with an injury crisis in the first half of the season while Chelsea have dropped points to Reading, Arsenal and Brighton, and Arsenal failed to collect more than a point against Aston Villa, City and Tottenham while also losing to Birmingham. Manchester United, meanwhile, have grown into contenders under Marc Skinner, while Tottenham remain a point above City despite their challenge seeming to be on the wane. “It never stops and we’ll keep going until the end,” said Taylor, whose side sit fifth, nine points behind Arsenal, the leaders, and five behind Chelsea. “It’s such an unpredictable race this season and very different to what we’ve seen over the last few years. In football anything can happen and it’s good that we’re still in the hunt.” Hayes similarly played up the opposition’s title credentials. “The pendulum can swing really quickly,” she said. “This is a six-point game; if they [City] win the pendulum swings in another direction. But I think next weekend [when Chelsea play Arsenal] will have a much bigger impact and give clarity on the positions.” For both managers, with an array of injuries affecting their teams, the chance to give minutes to almost every squad member has been a small silver lining. “I’ve got an incredibly happy dressing room,” said Hayes. “Every single player is involved. When you’ve got a big squad and not many games it’s a lot harder to manage, but we’ve had no choice, we’ve not had the players. ‘You’re tired? Don’t care, you’ve got to go again.’ Then you develop resilience. “That’s why I’m so proud of these performances. Because I didn’t know how we’d fair with all these back-to-back games. I didn’t know how Jessie Fleming or Niamh Charles or Erin Cuthbert would cope but they’ve been brilliant, they’ve shown something when the team really needed them to.” Taylor conceded Chelsea “have had the edge over us this season” and, with the London team unbeaten in each of their last nine WSL games against City, it could be argued they have had the edge a lot longer. However, City are far from the side that lost the reverse fixture 4-0 and Taylor praised the resilience his side have shown after a tough start to the campaign. “It’s testament to the squad,” he said. “Everyone stuck together in that moment, everyone pitched in, sometimes not playing in their ideal role but understanding the needs of the team. We don’t look at that lightly, we understand the importance of that. Now we’ve got real competition in the team whereas previously it was a little bit ‘needs must’, but the application and attitude has been spot-on.”",Sport/Football,Emma Hayes and Gareth Taylor call for expansion of WSL,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/emma-hayes-and-gareth-taylor-call-for-expansion-of-wsl
2/6/2022,"Mohamed Salah against Sadio Mané, two great Liverpool forwards going head-to-head in Sunday’s Africa Cup of Nations final. It’s the headline clash of Egypt against Senegal, the meeting of the most successful side in African history and a team that has never lifted the trophy. But to focus on them would be misleading: although both have had an influence late in games, neither Senegal nor Egypt could be said to be teams based around their attacking talent. There is an unavoidable sense that even to focus on the football is itself uncomfortable, given the tragic events of a fortnight ago when eight fans were trampled to death outside Stade Olembé, where the final will be staged. The quarter-final at the venue was moved, but after a review it was decided Thursday’s semi-final should be played there.  Emotionally that may have felt strange, walking across the road and through the gate where the tragedy occurred, but logistically it was almost certainly the right choice given the absence of viable alternatives for a major game featuring the hosts. Olembé is a magnificent stadium set in a vast amount of space; to create the conditions in which a crush could occur took spectacular incompetence. The extent to which lessons had been learned was difficult to tell on Thursday given only 24,000 turned up, seemingly put off by safety concerns. The disaster rightly dominates any consideration of the tournament, but what happened a week gone Monday was just part of much wider chaos. The Cup of Nations is a competition that feels as though it always has to justify its existence; these last few weeks have not made much of a case either on or off the pitch. The organisation has been generally dismal while, not helped by some poor playing surfaces, much of the football has been grim, with an average of just 1.88 goals per game. Senegal’s method is to stifle the opposition, take control of midfield and strike late on, something in which they have been aided in the last two games by the returning fitness of Ismaïla Sarr, who has been able to come off the bench and add to their attacking threat. Eight of the nine goals Senegal have scored in the tournament so far have come after the hour. Defensively they have been all but impeccable, letting in only one goal – Jannick Buyla’s kneed volley late in the quarter-final – and conceding nine shots on target in the whole tournament. Egypt’s method is simply to stifle, the natural caution of Carlos Queiroz combining with their traditional aptitude for timewasting to produce a style that has yielded just four goals in 630 minutes of football. They have let in only two, although they have been offering up 12.33 shots per game, most of which have been from range. The sense is that their greatest strength is their mental robustness and the way they get in the heads of their opponents – that, and penalties; Egypt have won their last six shootouts, including two here. Although they have beaten only Guinea-Bissau and Sudan in normal time so far in the tournament, they have had a far harder route to the final than Senegal, seeing off Ivory Coast, Morocco and the hosts Cameroon. And it should never be forgotten how difficult north African sides have always found tournaments in sub-Saharan Africa; Egypt themselves, in 2008 and 2010, are the only north African side ever to have won the Cup of Nations outside north Africa. But for all that, the lasting impression is of their gamesmanship. The legacy of their veteran goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary, who had the lowest pain threshold of any man ever to play international football, is secure in the hands of both Mohamed El Shenawy and, after he really did get injured in a confusing boy‑who‑cried‑wolf irony, Mohamed Abou Gabal. Egyptian goalkeeping is a long‑running medical soap opera to rank alongside Casualty or Emergency Ward 10, with Abou Gabal spending much of the semi-final writhing in hopeless agony. Queiroz himself has been in a bafflingly fretful mood all tournament, seething as he stalks his technical area, apparently convinced everything is rigged against him. The general behaviour of the Egypt bench in the quarter‑final was a disgrace, as they contested decision after decision, berating the fourth official and antagonising Morocco’s coaching staff, earning the assistant coach Roger De Sa a four-game ban. The Egyptian FA then protested against the appointment of the experienced referee Bakary Gassama for the semi-final, for no better reason it seemed than that he had taken charge of their group-stage defeat to Nigeria. Gassama, with his bald head and staring eyes very much the Gambian Collina, likes to impose himself and, having warned Queiroz when he went down on his knees, giving it the full Platoon as a free-kick near the halfway line went against his side early on, showed him two yellow cards for dissent in three second-half minutes. As a result, Queiroz will not be on the bench for the final. Queiroz continued his assault on Gassama after the game and then, laughably, another coach, Diaa El-Sayed, asked for the final to be delayed 24 hours because Egypt would have had a day’s less rest than their opponents. Senegal will have their own memories of how referees can be influenced by Egyptian pressure: the last time the sides met in the final stages, in the semi-final in Cairo in 2006, they were denied a blatant last-minute penalty when Diomansy Kamara was chopped down by Ibrahim Said with Egypt leading 2-1. That is just one of the historical disappointments Senegal are trying to overcome. Their coach, Aliou Cissé, missed the decisive penalty in the shootout in the final in 2002, and there is the fresher memory of defeat in the final to Algeria in 2019. For Senegal, winning the Cup of Nations has become a quest, their own doubts almost as much of a barrier as their opponents. In that context Egypt, ruthless serial winners, may be the worst side for them to be facing.",Sport/Football,Querulous Queiroz and his histrionic Egypt have the smarts to outwit Senegal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/05/querulous-queiroz-and-his-histrionic-egypt-have-the-smarts-to-outwit-senegal
2/6/2022,"Burnley and Watford played out a dour goalless draw in Roy Hodgson’s first match as the Hornets manager, an outcome which does the fortunes of neither’s side’s bid to avoid relegation any good. The nature of the relegation battle at the foot of the Premier League table means that these sides still have ample opportunities to haul themselves out of trouble in the coming months.  But even on a night where conditions made any sort of eye-catching action difficult, this was a brutal watch which will have done little to instil fear into the likes of Newcastle or Norwich. Both those sides will have certainly been delighted with this result. Wout Weghorst’s debut after joining from Wolfsburg, coupled with Hodgson’s appointment in the wake of Claudio Ranieri’s sacking, gave Burnley and Watford different reasons to be optimistic here. But when you consider these two teams have now scored just 39 goals in 40 games between them in the league, it is not difficult to see where the issues lie for Hodgson and Sean Dyche. The importance of the contest was perhaps the only thing in the air more palpable than the Biblical conditions, with both factors impacting the quality of a fairly timid first half. Burnley’s front two of Weghorst and Maxwel Cornet had the potential to excite, but they were severely inhibited amidst a backdrop of driving rain and swirling winds. Weghorst was given a crash course in the ways of the Premier League throughout the first half. A half-chance fell to the feet of the Netherlands striker on the edge of the Watford area, before Hassane Kamara plucked the ball away from his foot as Weghorst prepared to pull the trigger. An Aaron Lennon cross then looked to be bound directly for Weghorst’s head before Craig Cathcart intervened at the crucial moment to deny him again. In truth, there was little on offer from either side to provide too much in the way of entertainment, but as half-time approached Watford began to settle in and improve somewhat. Kamara’s through ball released Joshua King in the area but despite the forward evading the attention of James Tarkowski, he could only shoot straight at Nick Pope as the angle began to tighten on the Norwegian. From the resulting corner an almighty scramble looked as though it would lead to the opener as the ball ricocheted off Ben Mee’s shin towards the Burnley goal. Lennon, though, was on hand to prevent an own goal. It was the nearest either side had come to taking the lead but really, 0-0 was the fairest outcome at half-time given the quality on display. The quality, or lack of it, was underlined nine minutes after the restart as a stray pass from Mee set João Pedro free, but his pass to put King in on goal was wayward at best. King’s skewed attempt at a cross, which went harmlessly wide, was arguably just as bad. It was a tough watch and mercilessly, the conditions would only worsen as the contest ebbed towards its closing stages. Chances, in truth, were few and far between. That made every opportunity seem all the more important. Mee almost scored at the wrong end for the second time as he headed a Watford corner just wide of Pope, before Cornet forced a smart save from Ben Foster. Then the midfielder Tom Cleverley forced Pope to do the same in the final minutes, but you always felt this was destined to finish goalless.",Sport/Football,Frustration for Roy Hodgson as Watford draw a blank against Burnley,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/burnley-watford-premier-league-match-report
2/6/2022,"Thousands of protesters have hit the streets of some of Brazil’s biggest cities to denounce racist violence after the murder of a young Congolese refugee on one of Rio’s most famous beaches. On Saturday morning demonstrators flocked to the waterside bar where 24-year-old Moïse Mugenyi Kabagambe was beaten to death late last month with fists, feet and sticks.  The racially-charged murder – captured in chilling security camera footage – was followed days later by another killing in which an unarmed black man was shot by a white neighbour who claimed to have confused him with a thief. “It’s as if black blood is worth nothing,” said Bruna da Silva, one of several thousand people to join Saturday’s rally on Barra da Tijuca beach in Rio. “We’re here to say it does matter and that we won’t rest until we get justice.” Silva, 40, said she understood the pain of losing a child. Her son, Marcos Vinícius da Silva, was 14 when he was gunned down during a police operation in Rio’s Complexo da Maré community. “This was the shirt he was wearing,” Silva said, pointing to a bloodstained school uniform on the grass beside her. Adriana Rodrigues, whose 23-year-old son was killed last year during the deadliest police raid in Rio’s history, said: “I’m here for justice … what they did with this young man was wrong. “We’re victims of the same cowardice – and this must stop. Enough. Stop killing us.” Also present was the mother of Kabagambe, who fled conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2011 and built a new life in Brazil. “We will seek justice until the end,” Lotsove Lolo Lay Ivonne told protesters as they assembled under a fierce sun to demand an end to racist violence. Many demonstrators also demanded the removal of Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who is notorious for making prejudiced remarks about black and indigenous people. Bolsonaro has said nothing about the refugee’s death – but marchers had a great deal to say about him, chanting “Fora Bolsonaro!” (“Bolsonaro out!”) as they filed down the beach. Protesters also gathered in Brazil’s biggest city, São Paulo, the capital, Brasília, and Recife, Belo Horizonte, Salvador and Porto Alegre, as well as in London, Berlin and New York. Rio authorities have taken steps to support Kabagambe’s family, with the mayor announcing relatives will be handed control of the bar where he was murdered. “What happened was brutal, unacceptable and something that isn’t in Rio’s nature,” the finance secretary, Pedro Paulo, told reporters. Statistics, however, show the violent, premature death of young black men is very much part of life in Rio. Of the 1,245 people killed in police operations in Rio state in 2020, 86% were black. In the city of Rio, the proportion was 90%. “The only policy they have for the favela is the policy of genocide,” said Ana Paula Oliveira, 45, whose 19-year-old son, Johnatha, was killed by police in 2014. “It’s sickening that it never stops.” Social activist Wesley Teixeira said the scale of Saturday’s mobilisation gave him hope, while the normalisation of black deaths had made him despair. “The people here are survivors,” Teixeira said. “It’s in our unity we find solace.”",News/World news,Anti-racism protesters march in Brazil after refugee murdered in Rio,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/05/anti-racism-protesters-march-in-brazil-after-refugee-murdered-in-rio

2/6/2022,"At least they will always have Newcastle. Cambridge’s heroes of the third round could not extend their FA Cup run, having been outmuscled by a Luton team strong on set pieces and expert in punishing their opponents’ mistakes. First-half goals from Reece Burke and Carlos Mendes Gomes, and a late strike from Admiral Muskwe, the Zimbabwean having been excellent throughout, were enough to guide Luton through to the fifth round for the first time in nine years. Luton looked battle-hardened by life in the Championship, where they are mounting a play-off challenge, but were often threatened by the speedy attacks of Mark Bonner’s passing team, with the veteran Wes Hoolahan as the prime creator.  Bonner’s pre-match entry was almost gladiatorial as he walked around the field whipping up the home fans. He got the desired result as the game kicked off with crackling noise from the stands and a bright start from his team. He and the Luton manager, Nathan Jones, are close friends who share a Christian faith, but the pals’ act was set aside in a contest full of crunching challenges urged on from the sidelines. It was Cambridge’s biggest home tie since they held Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United seven years ago at the same stage of the competition. It was a sell out, the Luton fans behind one of the goals sheltered from an icy wind whipping off the Fens. There was no Joe Ironside, Cambridge’s goalscoring hero of the third-round win at Newcastle absent with an ankle injury. Jack Iredale, outstanding in defence that day, was also missing. Hoolahan, 40 in May, had been selected as an old-style, pint-sized schemer, the former Ireland international a throwback in dropping down the divisions to play for the love of the game. Early on, with the Luton keeper, Jed Steer, out of his area, the ball fell to Hoolahan, his shot briefly looking like dipping in. Next, a Hoolahan slide-rule pass to Harvey Knibbs set panic into the Luton defence, before Adam May’s shot flew over. Burke’s 16th-minute opener came seconds after more Hoolahan wizardry had created another chance, this time for the speedy James Brophy. It came very much against the run of play. Elliot Thorpe’s free-kick from the right was excellent and Burke climbed highest to nod into the bottom-left corner. That had a deflating effect on the home team, and their fans’ mood darkened further when Luton scored again seven minutes later. Carlos Mendes Gomes was assisted by another Premier League veteran in Cameron Jerome, and the former Atlético Madrid trainee’s high-stepping celebration in front of the Newmarket Road End did not go down at all well. Some ponderous defending suggested why Cambridge have mid-table status in League One. Their desire to play from the back was admirable but also the source of much of Luton’s attacking, with Peter Kioso and Fred Onyedinma forever charging forwards from wing-back. Kioso created an early second-half chance that Tom Lockyer knocked wide after Muskwe’s flick. Sam Smith, leading the line in Ironside’s stead, missed Cambridge’s best chance when shanking a shot wide after being granted penalty-box space on the hour, at a time when Luton began to exert more pressure and control greater territory. A late Cambridge push for a way back saw Brophy have a shot blocked, his last act before leaving the field as Luton’s defence reconfigured into a back five rather than three amid the heavier pressure. Hoolahan completed the 90, clearly tired, and played his part in the move from which sub Ben Worman tested Steer, the debutant keeper on loan from Aston Villa. From the rebound Smith rattled the post – only to be ruled offside. There were shrieks of excitement whenever the ball was near the Luton box, but their superior organisation told, and Muskwe’s deflected decider came from another counterattack.",Sport/Football,Admiral Muskwe inspires Luton to convincing victory over Cambridge ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/cambridge-luton-fa-cup-match-report
2/6/2022,"Boris Johnson’s desperate efforts to save his premiership were undermined on Saturday as one of his most loyal backbench supporters said it was now “inevitable” that Tory MPs would remove him from office over the “partygate” scandal. In an interview with the Observer, Sir Charles Walker, a former vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs, implored the prime minister to go of his own accord in the national interest, and likened the events in the Tory party to a Greek tragedy.  “It is an inevitable tragedy,” Walker said. “He is a student of Greek and Roman tragedy. It is going to end in him going, so I just want him to have some agency in that.” Walker said that in his view Johnson had got many things right, including the handling of the vaccine rollout, and deserved to be remembered for them, rather than suffer the indignity of losing a leadership challenge. But he said the succession of parties in Downing Street during national lockdowns had focused the anger of a traumatised country on No 10 in a way that could only be addressed if the prime minister moved aside. “It is just not going to get better,” he said. On Saturday night, Johnson moved to shore up his operation at No 10 – which was rocked by the resignations of five key aides on Thursday – by appointing the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, Steve Barclay, as his chief of staff and Guto Harri, who worked for him when Johnson was mayor of London, as his director of communications. The appointment of an MP to be chief of staff is highly unusual and suggests Johnson may have faced problems in recruiting an outsider to the role at a time when many in Whitehall doubt he will last much longer in No 10. Harri’s appointment is also a surprise as he has strongly criticised Johnson in recent years, including saying in 2018 that he would be “hugely divisive” as prime minister. Walker is understood not to have submitted a letter of no confidence in Johnson himself. But on Saturday night Tory backbenchers who have been trying to “crunch numbers” said they thought those wanting to ditch Johnson were only 10 to 20 short of the 54 letters that need to be submitted to the chair of the 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady. Some Conservative MPs said they believed that around 40 to 45 letters were in or pending, while another estimate that was circulating suggested the number was closer to the “early 30s”. The Observer understands that several MPs who have yet to go public are likely to put in letters early this week, before MPs go away for a 10-day recess on Thursday. “The recess would be a time for the prime minister to regroup so there will be an incentive to get the names in before then,” said one Tory source. The Tory MP for Wimbledon and former minister Stephen Hammond said he was “considering very carefully this weekend” whether he still has confidence in the prime minister and added that it “certainly looks like” the beginning of the end for Johnson. If and when Brady receives 54 letters, he would then consult the prime minister on when a vote of confidence among all Conservative MPs should take place. If Johnson then failed to win a majority, he would have to stand down. The mood has turned further against Johnson in recent days after he criticised Sir Keir Starmer in the Commons on Monday for failing to prosecute the child abuser Jimmy Savile during his time as director of public prosecutions. The baseless attack on the opposition leader led to the resignation on Thursday of Johnson’s longtime aide and head of policy at No 10, Munira Mirza, who had demanded that Johnson apologise, which he failed to do. Investigations by the Observer show that the unfounded claims about Starmer were being promoted, before Johnson aired them, by far-right groups including the UK branch of Proud Boys, a violent white nationalist organisation labelled a terrorist entity. After Johnson made the comments in the Commons, other notorious far-right groups, including football hooligans linked to the anti-Muslim English Defence League as well as the nationalist organisation the Traditional Britain Group, lauded him. The allegation appears to have roots in the far right’s obsession with the unfounded suggestion that the establishment is protecting paedophiles. On Saturday, the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, repeatedly sought to blame Remainers for plotting against the prime minister during a round of media interviews. However, out of the 15 Tory MPs who have so far publicly called on Boris Johnson to go, just seven of those backed remaining in the EU in the 2016 referendum. Among the Leavers who have said Johnson should go are David Davis, Andrew Bridgen and most recently the former education minister Nick Gibb. Dorries told Times Radio: “There are a small number of voices, whether they are people who were ardent supporters of Remain, who see this as their last opportunity to reverse Brexit.” Hammond, a Remainer, described Dorries’s remarks as “predictable rubbish from a predictable source”. In a further blow to the prime minister, his actions during the partygate scandal have been blamed by scientists for a sharp decline in the number of people getting a vaccine booster. Numbers of people being boosted dropped below 30,000 a day last week, with only 64.6% of the UK population over 12 years old receiving a third dose or booster so far. Behavioural scientists said declining trust in the prime minister, as well as the belief that Omicron is mild despite its impact, were behind the fall in vaccine take-up.",News/Politics,"‘Partygate’: Johnson’s removal is now inevitable, warns loyalist ",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/05/partygate-johnsons-removal-is-now-inevitable-warns-loyalist
2/6/2022,"Glory on the track. Growing criticism off it. China ended day one of these Winter Olympics by celebrating a thrilling first gold medal, while also finding itself facing growing condemnation from human rights groups after selecting a Uyghur to light the Olympic flame. The small number of fans in the Capital Indoor Stadium because of Covid-19 regulations certainly made themselves heard as China’s mixed relay quartet held off Italy by the width of a blade in a dramatic short-track speedskating final.  Afterwards, Wu Dajing, the country’s most famous active winter sports star, dedicated the victory to the nation. “We achieved this by working hard and pushing the envelope,” said the 27-year-old Wu. “We are very happy for this first gold medal for China, and as a motivation for our teammates in other events this is a very good start. We will work together. Thank you!” However, China’s early success in these Games was overshadowed by the reaction to its decision to choose cross-country skier Dinigeer Yilamujiang, from the western Xinjiang region, where more than a million Uyghurs are in re-education camps, to perform the ceremonial act of lighting the flame. The criticism was led by the World Uyghur Congress, which said it was “shocking and insensitive” and that China was deliberately sending a blunt message to a people it represses. “China is politicising the Olympics, which we warned the IOC [International Olympic Committee] would happen,” its spokesperson, Zumretay Arkin, said. “But they didn’t want to listen to us. It is shocking and hugely insensitive to use a Uyghur athlete this way, when there is an ongoing genocide.” The IOC has not commented on the repression of the Uyghurs, saying that it must stay politically neutral. But Arkin insisted that position is a sham. “At the opening ceremony, the whole IOC narrative about sports and politics not mixing was shown up,” she added. “China’s government was sending a message: we control you, and we get to do whatever we want without being held accountable, and everyone is complicit in it.” Her comments were reinforced by Bennett Freeman, a member of the Coalition to End Forced Labour in the Uyghur Region’s steering committee, who called China’s decision “a brazen, cynical ploy that the world should see through”. But the IOC adopted a very different tone when asked about the opening ceremony and the decision to select Dinigeer, calling it a “lovely concept”. “Obviously the opening ceremony is something that the organising committee put together and there’s creative input,” said IOC spokesman Mark Adams. “We are involved to a certain extent.” “This is an athlete who is competing here. She has every right, wherever she comes from, whatever her background, to compete and to take part in any ceremony.” Games organisers said the final handful of torchbearers who entered the stadium with the flame had been picked on the basis of their birth dates, with each having been born in a different decade, starting from the 1950s through to the 2000s. “I think it was a lovely concept,” added Adams. The IOC also promised that a Dutch reporter who was dragged away by Chinese security officials in the middle of a live broadcast was the victim of an isolated event. “I think someone was being overzealous,” said Adams. “He was able very quickly afterwards, with the help of officials there, to do his piece to camera. “These things do happen. I hope it is a one-off, and we assure you that within the closed loop you will be able to go about your work.” China ranks 177 out of 180 in the 2021 Reporters Without Borders World Press Freedom Index, but Beijing 2022 spokesperson Yan Jiarong promised that media rights would be respected. “We welcome all the international media to cover the Beijing 2022 Games and we will also protect the legal rights of the international journalists,” she added. Meanwhile there was further controversy as the Norwegian Therese Johaug, who missed the 2018 Winter Olympics because she was serving a doping ban, won the first gold medal of the Beijing Games in the women’s 7.5km+7.5km skiathlon. Norwegian skiing officials blamed the positive drug test in 2016 on a team doctor’s mistake, claiming she had accidentally given Johaug a banned steroid that was contained in a lip balm, but the skier was still given an 18-month suspension for her negligence in missing a clear warning in the label listings. But the most thrilling gold medal on the first day came in the short-track speedskating as China’s team of Wu, Ren Ziwei, Fan Kexin and Qu Chunyu took gold from Italy by less than two-hundredths of a second. They were lucky to have made the final after only coming third in their semi-final, with only the top two making it through. However, a referee spotted an infringement by the US and Russian teams, which meant they were back in. “We were all disappointed and a little confused,” said US skater Andrew Heo. “It was an interesting call, for sure,” added teammate Maame Biney. Afterwards, Wu became emotional when discussing his family. “It has been a very difficult four years,” he admitted. “But we didn’t give up. I didn’t give up. Our families keep cheering us up, and providing us with the best support, even though we barely come home. I can’t imagine how they feel now.” Or the rest of China, for that matter.",Sport/Sport,China bags Winter Games gold and a rap for ‘cynical ploy’ of Uyghur torchbearer,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/05/china-bags-winter-games-gold-and-a-rap-for-cynical-ploy-of-uyghur-torchbearer
