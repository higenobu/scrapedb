3/31/2022,"Experts have called for additional government funding to build “China competency” in the UK education system in the face of “a severe national deficit” in China literacy and Mandarin speakers. Despite the growing importance of China in the world today, research by the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) concluded the UK lacks sufficient knowledge and understanding of China to “make sensible decisions”. The report cited the government’s decision to remove Huawei from UK networks in light of perceived security risks, which was estimated to cost BT £500m, “a cost that arguably could have been avoided if there had been greater understanding and awareness of China within the UK government”. According to Hepi, the number of Chinese studies students has not increased in the past 25 years and there has been a decline in the number of Chinese studies departments in UK universities offering single-honours undergraduate degrees, down a third from 13 to nine between 2019 and 2020. In schools, modern China is “largely absent” from curricula and most pupils will not engage with China at all during their studies. There has been some progress in the study of Mandarin in schools, but the qualifications are “problematic”, the Hepi report says, and numbers are small. While there is strong research and expertise in universities, it is often the result of hiring of specialists from the rest of the world. Chinese specialists, meanwhile, face challenges around academic freedom and universities “are not sufficiently transparent” about funding sources. The Hepi report is based on interviews with more than 40 experts in education, government and business. Academics who were interviewed agreed that despite the controversy surrounding Confucius Institutes, they have played a critical role in the teaching of Mandarin in the absence of other investment. The report calls for the government to publish a strategy to tackle what has been described as a “generational challenge” to build China literacy in the UK, and consider targeted funding for Chinese studies in universities and investment to help train school teachers in modules that cover modern China. Rana Mitter, professor of Chinese history and politics at the University of Oxford, writing in the report, said: “In a post-Covid world, the way that China responds to questions relating to everything from science funding to global supply chains will have direct impacts on the UK. “As in any democratic society, there will be varied views in the British public sphere on how to deal with China. Those views will often be robustly expressed, as is only right in a free society. But those conversations and debates can no longer afford to take in a swift and superficial view of China. The time to deepen the debate has surely arrived.” The author of the report, Michael Natzler, added: “Regardless of the levels of scepticism or support for China’s activities today, there is an expert consensus that the UK lacks sufficient knowledge and understanding of China to make sensible decisions. This is an issue that is long overdue for being addressed.”",News/Politics,"Teach UK students about China to tackle knowledge ‘deficit’, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/31/teach-uk-students-about-china-to-tackle-knowledge-deficit-say-experts
3/31/2022,"They call it April Fools’ Day for a reason. From tomorrow, 1 April, Boris Johnson’s government will end the provision of free lateral flow and PCR tests for the majority of people in England. Ministers have announced that only a limited number of groups will now have access without having to pay. That includes symptomatic hospital patients when it is required for their care, and people living or working in “high-risk settings” such as care homes and prisons. Free asymptomatic testing will remain available for care home and patient-facing staff in the NHS, but only when there is a high prevalence of the virus and it is determined that infections may spread quickly. By ending free testing just as coronavirus infection rates soar – and a cost of living crisis leaves people without spare cash – the government is creating a perfect storm for illness. People will now be in the dark as to whether they have the virus, unless they can afford a test or choose to buy one, and could go into public spaces while infected, spreading the virus to people they would previously have protected by self-isolating. The public health messaging is clear enough: don’t worry about Covid any more, but if you insist on bothering, you can pay for a test yourself. Or as Sajid Javid, the health secretary, put it: now that free testing has ended, people with Covid symptoms should “socialise a bit less”. With the partygate scandal back on the political agenda, it may be in Johnson’s best interests to pretend that coronavirus is old news, but it is in no one else’s. Scientists have been all too clear on the likely consequences of ending free testing: increased infection rates, extra pressure on an already struggling NHS, more people getting long Covid, delays in detecting new variants. Also bear in mind that ministers have just axed funding for our world-leading infection tracker system. The government claims that its testing plan will at least still protect the most vulnerable to coronavirus – but it appears that the majority of clinically vulnerable people, and the people they come into contact with, will not be eligible. Some high-risk people who need to have Covid treatments, such as antivirals, will be granted free tests, but government guidelines say they are only to be used once they are ill and already showing symptoms. It’s the public health equivalent of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. This fundamentally misses what has been so valuable about large-scale testing over the past two years: it’s not that high-risk people can see if they have Covid, but that those they’re due to come into contact with can. It is good news that ministers have relented and will not just test NHS and care home staff when they have symptoms, but it’s concerning that asymptomatic frontline workers will be left untested outside times of vaguely defined “high prevalence”. Public sector workers enduring real-term pay cuts can hardly be expected to pay for regular tests themselves, and it is negligent to tell patients they should be treated by an untested medic. Roughly a third of people who have coronavirus don’t show any symptoms, and hospitals – which are by their nature frequented by sick and vulnerable people – will always be areas of high risk of infection. It is not enough for an asthmatic mum to worry about catching Covid in the shops, bus and classroom – now she has to risk it from her respiratory nurse. The government’s plan commits to testing care home staff, but there is little word on carers and personal assistants who work in the community, many of whom go into multiple disabled and older people’s homes each day. Nor is there any help for unpaid carers, despite them largely living in poverty and already worried about going out and bringing back germs to their vulnerable family member. Putting the financial burden of testing on to disabled people and their families during an energy crisis, which will itself hit people with disabilities hard, is outright cruelty. In the coming weeks, vulnerable care users will be forced to choose between buying an LFT to keep well and paying energy bills to keep warm. There is also little help in the plan for people visiting elderly or disabled relatives in care homes, except a pledge that asymptomatic testing will remain available to “a small number of care home visitors who provide personal care”. Care home visitors may end up having to pay about £73 a month just to see loved ones, according to the Alzheimer’s Society, or else risk walking in being potentially contagious. Ministers’ infamous “protective ring” around care homes seems to have cracked once again. From the very beginning of the pandemic, there have been voices seeking to downplay the threat of the virus to falsely suggest that protective measures are both restrictive and unnecessary. In many ways, the end of free testing is the ultimate example of this narrative. Not content with low sick pay, no mandated masks or ending the legal duty to isolate with Covid, England is about to abandon a public health tool that has undoubtedly saved many lives in the pandemic. That this is being done just as hospital admissions from Covid rise again is a national act of self-sabotage. Some will say “we can’t afford testing”, but common sense says we cannot afford not to. The cost of increased hospitalisations as well as the fallout of long Covid will probably dwarf any testing costs; lateral flow tests make up a tiny fraction of the £2bn testing budget. Others will praise ditching LFTs as a sign of liberty restored, although it’s unlikely that this cohort will include the clinically vulnerable. Those who want their “freedom” will need to explain what it is exactly about access to universal healthcare that is so restrictive. Ultimately, there is a choice: embrace the low-restriction, preventive measures that enable us all to get back to normal life as safely as possible, or accept uncontrolled transmission of the virus. The path taken reflects the extent to which the government really believes that every life matters. When it comes to that particular test, they have certainly failed.

3/31/2022,"UK house prices grew at the fastest annual pace since 2004 in March, continuing the ascent to new record levels – a fifth higher than at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Prices rose by 14.3% in the year to March, the strongest pace of increase since November 2004 when the UK experienced a housing boom that preceded the financial crisis, according to Nationwide, the UK’s largest building society. The price of an average UK home hit £265,312, more than £33,000 higher than March 2021. Price rises were evident across the country, with prices in Wales soaring by 15% over the year. House price growth accelerated in every region of England and Scotland. Detached homes have gone up nearly £68,000 in price since the start of pandemic, a 22% rise, as people working from home sought out bigger properties, while average flat prices have increased by £24,000, or 14%. The near-relentless rise in house prices has come despite the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic, which caused a deep slump in activity. However, government wage support schemes and savings during lockdowns have supported the housing market. Nationwide estimated that reduced spending has meant that households were on average able to save £190bn more than would have been expected before the pandemic – £6,500 per household, albeit unevenly spread. The government also intervened with stamp duty cuts which subsidised the housing industry and helped to keep prices rising as soon as the market unfroze. Economists are now trying to ascertain whether rising inflation (including unprecedented increases in energy bills from Friday when the UK’s price cap increases) and rising interest rates to combat it will finally dent a market that has seemed nearly unaffected by successive waves of the virus. “The housing market has retained a surprising amount of momentum given the mounting pressure on household budgets and the steady rise in borrowing costs,” said Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist. “A combination of robust demand and limited stock of homes on the market has kept upward pressure on prices.” However, he warned that he expected the market to slow in the coming months. “The squeeze on household incomes is set to intensify, with inflation expected to rise further, perhaps reaching double digits in the quarters ahead if global energy prices remain high,” Gardner said.",News/Business,UK house prices grow at fastest rate for 17 years,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/31/uk-house-prices-grow-at-fastest-rate-for-17-years
3/31/2022,"It is often said that people are entitled to their opinions. But are they really? Do you have a God-given right to believe that torture is good, or that the moon landings were faked? To the extent that opinions are not merely secret possessions but dispositions to act a certain way in society, they are everyone’s business. So, no, you don’t have an inalienable right to your dumb opinion. Unfortunately, that was also the position of the Spanish Inquisition and witch-hunters, who dreamed up vicious ways of attempting to uncover inner impiety. So these days we generally separate opinions (or beliefs) from the expression of them. Expression can be regulated, in the case of incitement to hatred, for example, but opinion is sacrosanct. It’s a fundamental freedom, but one that is everywhere under attack. So begins human rights lawyer Susie Alegre’s fascinating book, which sketches a brief history of legal freedoms from the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi onwards, and explains the conceptual struggles behind the Universal Declaration of Human Rights announced in 1948. That text defends rights to freedom of both “thought” and “opinion”: some delegates understood “thought” to mean religious belief, while others considered it superfluous as an addition to “opinion”; it was the Soviets who insisted it remain, “out of respect for the heroes and martyrs of science”. But if “opinion” was merely a private, internal affair, why did its freedom need protecting at all? This was, Alegre explains, at the behest of the British, who “insisted that ‘in totalitarian countries, opinions were definitely controlled by careful restriction of the sources of information’, stressing that interference could happen even before an opinion was formed”. The Brits, having had a Propaganda Bureau and then a Ministry of Information, as well as birthing a certain George Orwell, knew what they were talking about. If propaganda undermines the right to freedom of opinion, however, then we are all in trouble. And this is one of the main arguments that Alegre pursues. The modern online environment, polluted as it is by fake news, violates our freedom to form reliable thoughts. On this view, the people who stormed the US Capitol in January 2021, in the apparently sincere belief that the presidential election had been stolen by Joe Biden, were victims; and so are the millions of ordinary Russians who believe what the state-controlled media is telling them about the so-called special operation in Ukraine. The online world, Alegre argues, harms our freedoms in many other ways, and is of a piece with the cruel history she sketches of phrenology, lobotomies and CIA mind-control experiments. It was recently reported that Nadine Dorries, the UK minister for culture wars, stormed into a meeting with Microsoft and demanded to know when they were going to get rid of “algorithms”: not really possible for a software company, since all computer programs are made of algorithms, but the story does reflect an increasing public suspicion of the ways machines are being used to manipulate us. Researchers in facial-recognition AI systems, for example, claim to be able to read political affiliation from a photograph; social-media companies analyse posts for indicators of personality traits; fitness trackers are attempting to move into mood-tracking; and fancy new brain-scanning “lie detectors” have been used by prosecutors in Indian courts, arguably infringing the right to avoid self-incrimination. Even if the claims for such technologies are so far overblown, they all represent novel attempts to intrude into what used to be a private mental space. Here Alegre adroitly cites Nineteen Eighty-Four and its discussion of the lesser-discussed sibling of thoughtcrime, which Orwell called “facecrime”: “It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in a public place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself – anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide.” From facecrime to Facebook, and Orwell’s “prolefeed” (“the rubbishy entertainment and spurious news which the Party handed out to the masses”) to the Twitter feed, is a worryingly short distance. It’s amusing that liking a Facebook page called “Being Confused After Waking Up From Naps” is a strong predictor of male heterosexuality, but it’s grimmer to learn that a leaked Facebook document boasted it was able to target “moments when young people need a confidence boost” on behalf of advertisers. Any and all information we feed into the social-media maw, Alegre notes, “will be analysed to reveal psychological traits or fleeting states of mind that will, in turn, be used to manipulate our behaviour or to tell others how they should treat us”. This is particularly egregious in the realm of behaviour-tracking targeted at children. Whenever you hear tech companies paying lip-service to “ethics”, Alegre warns, you should be suspicious. “You don’t need to be much of a cynic to see why ethical guidelines may be more palatable to big tech than actual regulation. Ethics are optional.” Legal remedies, then, are required. The headline remedy she suggests is quite thrillingly radical: an outright ban on “surveillance advertising” – the kind dependent on trackers and cookies, that beams out your personal data to hundreds of companies whenever you load a webpage. We never asked for it, and we don’t like it. Just make it illegal, along with other key parts of the digital panopticon, such as “emotion analysis” tech in public places, or Amazon’s voice-activated Alexa devices. “When my daughter asked why she couldn’t have an Alexa like her friends,” Alegre relates heroically, “I told her that it is because Alexa steals your dreams and sells them.” We have all sleepwalked into this gloomy fairytale, and it’s time to wake up. There remain questions, though, about how far regulation can or should go, since it seems impossible to police all the manifold threats to our cognitive autonomy that Alegre identifies. Some, indeed, are hardly peculiar to the digital age at all. “If inferences can be drawn about your inner world based on your appearance,” she writes, “it does not matter what you actually think or feel. Your freedom to be who you are is curtailed by society’s judgment of you.” Maybe so, but this is lamentably inevitable if you want to live in society at all. If it should be impermissible, meanwhile, for “governments, companies or people” to seek to “manipulate our opinions”, on the grounds that this violates our right to freedom of thought, one wonders what kind of persuasive speech would still be allowed in such a brave new world. Aren’t arguments of all kinds – political, scientific, artistic – attempts to manipulate the opinions of others? How do we sort the good kind of manipulation from the bad? A benevolent philosopher-king would no doubt figure this out for us, but in the regrettable absence of one it doesn’t seem likely that many people would want to leave it up to a legal authority, whether or not it’s called a Ministry of Truth.
