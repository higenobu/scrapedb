3/2/2022,"The value of Russia’s Ruble against the United States Dollar is worth less than a cent. To prevent a further collapse, the Russian Central Bank raised the interest rates to 20% from 9.5% Bitcoin purchases against the Russian Ruble rose to $1.5 billion in a single day. The imposition of sanctions, elimination of Russia from SWIFT, European Union’s ban of Central Bank’s transactions is already beginning to affect the country’s economy. In less than 24 hours after the US announced its sanctions and the decision of removing Russia from SWIFT, Ruble tumbled. One Ruble was worth about 1.2 cents or $0.012 until a few hours ago. Then, however, due to the invasion of Ukraine worsening and considering the response from the world, its value fell. Plunging by a mind-boggling 21.29% is currently worth less than a cent at $0.009. The broader impact of this fall of value is that the Central Bank raised its key interest rates. In addition, as the Ruble’s value collapses, Russia is taking steps to avoid hyperinflation. And for the same reason, the Bank raised its interest rates on deposits to 20%, which is higher than most of Russia’s securities and stocks. Furthermore, the Bank is looking into ways to fight the ban and elimination from SWIFT. Since the country cannot access any of its 14 trillion Rubles and the $1.1 trillion forex reserves, it is looking at another way. Incentivizing investors with a 20% interest rate is a step in that direction. The State Duma deputy from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF), Nikolai Arefiev, even went on to say: “If they block all the funds that are abroad, then the government will have no choice but to seize all the deposits of the population – there are about 60 trillion rubles – in order to get out of the situation” Thus to save money, as predicted by FXEmpire, the citizens have officially begun to turn to crypto. Data from Coindesk – Kaiko shows that over 1.5 billion Rubles worth of Bitcoin in Rubles pair was traded in just 24 hours. Recently, the Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine appealed to every cryptocurrency exchange around the world to block and freeze the addresses of Russian and Belarusian politicians and the citizens of Russia and “sabotage” them. As the war worsens, problems for Ukrainian and Russian people will increase as their lifestyle gets much more expensive. One can only pray that neither of the countries’ citizens ends up paying a wheelbarrow of money to buy one loaf of bread.

3/2/2022,"Americans who rely on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction at tax time may be in luck. A Democratic proposal aims to restore the SALT deduction for taxpayers who make less than $400,000 a year and increase the deduction cap for Americans who make up to $1 million. The Supporting Americans with Lower Taxes (SALT) Act, sponsored by U.S. Reps. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) and Katie Porter (D-Calif.) would undo the $10,000 cap on the SALT deduction instituted in 2018 under former President Donald Trump. Here's a look at how the SALT deduction and how the proposed legislation could impact your finances. For help with your taxes, managing your investments or creating a holistic financial plan, consider working with a financial advisor. What is the SALT Deduction? The state and local tax deduction has existed since the federal income tax was introduced in 1913. The provision allows taxpayers who itemize to deduct property, sales and/or income taxes they paid to state or local governments on their federal income tax returns. Previously, there was no cap on SALT deductions. This allowed taxpayers to deduct as many state and local taxes from their federal income. However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) created a $10,000 limit on the deduction, disproportionately affecting higher-income earners in high-tax states. Critics argue that the SALT deduction is merely a tax loophole for the wealthy. Prior to the TCJA, taxpayers making at least $100,000 a year realized 91% of the benefit of the SALT deduction, according to the Tax Foundation. How SALT Would Change
 While the $10,000 ceiling on the SALT deduction is set to expire at the end of 2025 under the TCJA, Malinowski and Porter hope to reform the tax code before that happens. Under the SALT Act, people making less than $400,000 would once again be permitted to deduct all state and local taxes on their federal income tax returns, provided they itemize their deductions. But instead of lifting the cap for all taxpayers, under the proposed legislation, the deduction would start at $60,000 for those making over $400,000 and reduce at a rate of $10,000 for each $100,000 of income thereafter. Pointing to Tax Foundation estimates, Malinowski and Porter say their bill will raise $150.9 billion over 10 years compared to maintaining the $10,000 ceiling through 2025 and then allowing it to expire completely. Under the proposed legislation, the revenue would be used to create a Medicare Vision and Hearing Trust Fund and pay for hearing and vision benefits. ""Our tax code should provide a level playing field across states, not punish some Americans for living in regions with high costs of living,"" Porter said in a statement. ""Our SALT Act will restore fairness to our tax code, with sensible guardrails to prevent abuse by the ultra-wealthy."" Benjamin Silliman, a professor of accountancy at St. John's University in New York, said the legislation would reset the tax base more equitably and have a positive impact. However, he offered one caveat. ""In many states, the cap on the SALT deduction causes taxpayers to have to fork over even more money to the federal government. In the end, increasing the SALT deduction cap will be a step in the right direction,"" Silliman said. ""The one reality that this proposal lacks is that a large portion of the SALT deduction goes to property owners, where lower- and middle-income taxpayers who do not own homes may not benefit as much from the SALT deduction. This will have to be addressed by Congress sooner rather than later."" Will It Become Law? Since the SALT deduction is designed to help Americans avoid double-taxation, those living in higher-cost-of-living (and often Democratic) states tend to benefit the most. But can Democrats pass the reform? While they currently hold a majority in the House of Representatives and own a tie-breaker in the Senate, the midterm elections in November could dramatically reshape the two chambers in favor of Republicans, limiting Democrats' hopes of repealing the cap on SALT deductions. And this also isn't the first time Democrats have sought to reform the laws surrounding SALT. The $1.75 trillion Build Back Better act included a provision that would have raised the cap on SALT deductions from $10,000 to $80,000. While House Democrats passed the bill in November, it stalled in the Senate, dashing hopes of SALT reform. Bottom Line A pair of House Democrats have sponsored legislation that would restore the state and local tax (SALT) deduction for Americans who make under $400,000. Trump's 2017 tax cut capped the previously unlimited SALT deduction at $10,000, hurting taxpayers who itemize their deductions, especially those in high-tax states. However, the new bill aims to remove that ceiling for the majority of taxpayers who itemize and institute a new, increased cap for those who earn over $400,000 per year.

3/2/2022,"By Jessica DiNapoli (Reuters) - Get ready for the $10 tube of toothpaste. Colgate-Palmolive Co CEO Noel Wallace said last week at an industry conference that the household goods maker sees its new Optic White Pro Series toothpaste as the type of premium product ""vital"" to its ability to raise prices, which will help drive profit growth this year. His remarks come when many consumer products companies are hiking prices as much as they can to offset their own rising costs, a trend that could continue due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, whose economic risks include driving up gasoline prices. So far retailers and consumers seem largely unfazed by higher prices. But some lawmakers and consumer advocates argue that companies are excessively raising prices in order to fuel profits and return money to shareholders. ""We're seeing significant price hikes on virtually every item consumers purchase,"" said U.S. Representative David Cicilline, who is working on proposed antitrust legislation aimed at bringing down prices. ""They're imposing real hardships. People are taking things out of their grocery carts because it’s too expensive."" In the past, major retailers such as Walmart Inc pushed back on price hikes. But now, retailers like Walmart and Target Corp, which is to report quarterly results Tuesday, are mostly going along with them. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission over the last three months has probed sky-high prices and supply chain disruptions, requiring companies including Procter & Gamble, Kraft Heinz Co, Kroger Co and Walmart to turn over internal documents on profit margins, pricing and promotions. Comments on the inquiry are due March 14 and so far show small grocers angry with having to pay more and receive less of crucial products. Consumers wrote in about being unable to find oatmeal, cereal and cat food. In an interview with Reuters, Cicilline cited Colgate as an example of a company touting price hikes, making basic items too costly, and paying out more to investors. Colgate expects its margins to widen this year, due in part to higher prices. It also bought back almost 50% more shares last year, a boon for investors. Raising prices is a ""key capability"" for Colgate that will help drive profit growth, Wallace said last week. A Colgate spokesperson said in a statement that the company has a wide portfolio of products at different price points, and touted its new $10 toothpaste as the first with 5% hydrogen peroxide, with ""demonstrated efficacy to whiten teeth.” Consumer goods companies last year started hiking prices in response to rising raw material costs and labor shortages due to the pandemic. ""There is incredible appetite for our products,"" said Katie Denis, a spokeswoman for the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group for consumer packaged goods companies including Colgate. ""We make essentials. And there is no option of not delivering."" Prices also rose on competing private label items, analysts said. The White House is targeting corporate profits as it grapples with inflation. Bharat Ramamurti, deputy director of the White House's National Economic Council, said there are examples of companies outside of the meatpacking industry — which has particularly been in the White House's crosshairs — increasing prices beyond their own climbing costs. Lindsay Owens, executive director of the progressive non-profit Groundwork Collaborative, named diapers as a category with little competition, paving the way for aggressive price hikes. Kimberly-Clark Corp's margins took a hit in 2021 due to rising costs. The maker of Huggies diapers is betting that consumers will buy pricier options made with plant-based material, helping its profits recover, executives said at last week's conference. P&G executives said last week that they expect margins to continue to improve as higher prices hit stores. The company also plans to buy back more stock than originally planned. ""Many companies are taking advantage of high consumer demand to continue to raise prices when they don’t need to,"" said Jack Gillis, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, a non-profit consumer interest group. ""As long as consumers are willing to pay those prices, there’s no incentive to lower them.""

3/2/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese power plants and steelmakers are looking for alternatives to Russian coal after some domestic banks suggested they avoid purchases due to the mounting sanctions being imposed on Moscow. Most Read from Bloomberg Russia Steps Up Aerial Campaign Against Cities: Ukraine Update Belarus Preparing to Send Soldiers, Report Says: Ukraine Update Teen Who Tracked Elon Musk’s Jet Is Now Chasing Russian Tycoons World’s Biggest Plane Destroyed in Russian Attack on Airfield Microsoft Says Son of CEO Satya Nadella Has Died at 26 Some state-own firms were sent private client notes by the lenders advising them to halt buying Russian coal as tightening global restrictions could cause “unexpected damage” to China’s importers, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named as the issues are commercially sensitive. At least two of China’s largest state-owned banks are limiting financing for Russian commodities. That includes Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., which has stopped issuing U.S. dollar-denominated letters of credit from its offshore unit for Chinese firms seeking raw materials from Russia. Yuan-denominated credit lines are still available for some clients, however. The Chinese coal importers are now waiting for clearer policy signals from Beijing on whether they can resume purchases, while traders are seeking transactions in yuan rather than dollars, according to the people. China has so far been ambiguous on the Russian invasion of Ukraine as it tries to balance its ties to Moscow with its role as a global power. Unlike some other commodities such as oil, China is not heavily reliant on coal imports, producing around 90% of its needs itself. Of the volumes it does bring in, around 14% came from Russia last year, customs data show. Even so, if China does accept more Russian coal, it will likely weigh on Asian prices. Russia will need to divert 38% of its coal exports, or 82 million tons, from Europe and Ukraine to China and other Asian countries if the crisis goes on, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Michelle Leung said in a note. Demand from China and India is likely to weaken as they crank up local production, while Indonesia is planning to increase its shipments overseas this year, she said. China’s benchmark thermal coal futures rose by 2.3% to 789 yuan a ton early Tuesday. Without supply from Russia, China could look to import more from Indonesia, the world’s top thermal coal shipper. Indonesian coal futures traded in Singapore rose Monday to the highest since Nov. 10.

3/2/2022,"Oil is up, the Russian ruble is down, and financial markets are showing increased levels of volatility. The rolling boil in the markets comes as Russia’s Vladimir Putin has launched the largest ground war in Europe since the Second World War. It’s no wonder that investors are starting to seek out defensive positions. The classic defensive position, of course, is the dividend stock. Plenty of companies send out a dividend but only a select group attract the attention of serious dividend investors. These are the stocks that pay out the highest yielding dividends with the most reliable payment histories. In turbulent times like these, the market’s dividend champions are sure to get a second look from investors. Bearing this in mind, we used the TipRanks' database to zero-in on two stocks that are showing high dividend yields – on the order of 8%. Each stock also holds a Strong Buy consensus rating; let’s see what makes them so attractive to Wall Street’s analysts. Brigham Minerals (MNRL) One of the biggest economic sectors to feel the fallout from the Russia-Ukraine fighting is the energy sector. Russia is a major hydrocarbon exporter, and has not been shy about using its energy clout in foreign policy. In the lead-up to the Ukraine crisis, Russia has been building the Nordstream 2 pipeline, a natural gas pipeline to Germany that bypasses Ukraine. While the ins and outs of the project and its impact on international relations are beyond the scope of this article, it may be of interest to take a look into the US hydrocarbon sector. And there we’ll find Brigham Minerals. Based in Austin, Texas, Brigham is a mineral and royalty interest acquisition company – that is, it buys up land holdings and the rights to resource exploitation thereon, and collects royalties on the oil and gas extracted from those lands. Brigham’s portfolio includes land holdings some of the richest resource basins in the lower 48, including the Williston of North Dakota, the DJ of Colorado/Wyoming, the Scoop/Stack of Oklahoma, and the Midland and Delaware of Texas and New Mexico. Brigham's operating model differentiates it from its peers, focusing as it does on maximizing royalties. The company directs its purchases to just 5 ‘tier one’ regions, with proven hydrocarbon output; leases its holdings to a diverse group of well-capitalized operational firms; and focuses solely on land purchases and royalty acquisitions, avoiding any expenses for lease development or operations. This strategy has been successful for the company, and in its last quarterly report, for 4Q21, Brigham showed over $47 million at the top line, a company record. It was also the sixth quarter in a row with a sequential revenue gain. In a key metric for dividend investors, Brigham finished the quarter with $27.7 million in discretionary cash flow to fund the dividend. The dividend was paid out as both a base – of 14 cents per common share – and variable dividend, of 31 cents. The company uses the variable dividend to adjust total payment to make up 80% of discretionary cash flow. The combined dividend marked the sixth consecutive quarter that the payment increased for common shareholders. In Q4, Brigham paid out a total dividend of 45 cents per common share. At that payment, the dividend annualizes to $1.80 and yields 8%. Even more important for dividend investors, however, is Brigham’s forward guidance. The company anticipates royalty-generating production increasing on its holdings by 25% in the coming year, allowing for an increase in the base dividend of 2 cents per share. With the usual variables added to it, this should create a windfall for dividend investors. RBC’s 5-star analyst TJ Schultz notes the bullish dividend outlook, and writes, “At ~80% payout levels we see a path to >$2.00/share in dividends in 2022 (implying a ~10% forward dividend yield). This keeps us constructive on the story; we like MNRL for its diversified exposure to core basins amid strong commodity prices, attractive yield, and disciplined acquisition strategy…” To this end, Schultz rates MNRL an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, while his $30 price target implies a one-year upside potential to the stock of ~32%. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~40% potential total return profile. (To watch Schultz’s track record, click here) Brigham’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on a 4 to 1 split favoring the Buys over the Holds, while the average price target of $27.20 indicates room for ~19% upside from the share price of $22.78. (See MNRL stock forecast on TipRanks) Trinity Capital (TRIN) With the next up, Trinity Capital, we’ll shift our focus. Trinity works with venture debt, making new capital available to start-up companies. While risky, this activity is essential for the economy, as it’s the funding engine for the ‘tip of the spear,’ the innovative companies that will define the economic future. Trinity, which went public in February of last year, has provided more than $1.5 billion in funding for over 175 companies in its lifetime. In the year since it entered the public markets, Trinity has shown rising revenues and steadily increasing share price. At the top line, the company reported $22.5 million in 3Q21, the last reported, and the stock is up 29% since the IPO. Trinity will report its 4Q and full year 2021 results on March 3. In a bit of preview of the Q4 results, Trinity has already reported new fundings for the last quarter. The company originated some $248 million in ‘gross debt and equity commitments’ during the quarter, making its total funding commitments for 2021 an impressive $757 million. The Q4 originations included $121 million to 11 new companies in the portfolio, along with $76.5 million to 14 existing portfolio companies. Trinity generates income through the return on its investments, specifically, the loan repayments and interest, and the company in its own turn returns these profits to its shareholders through a common share dividend payment. The upshot is, Trinity has increased its dividend in each of the last four quarters, with the last declaration, in December 2021, being 36 cents per share, or 9% higher than the 3Q21 payment. At the current payment, the dividend annualizes to $1.44 and gives an 8% yield. All of this has caught the attention of B. Riley analyst Sarkis Sherbetchyan, who writes: “We raise our NII per share estimates across the board to reflect robust net originations and meaningfully higher earning assets compared to our previous model... We reason TRIN’s NII growth and recent proceeds from the monetization of equity investments provide the board with ample room to continue raising distributions to shareholders… We appreciate TRIN’s internally managed structure, growth potential for NII and dividends, as well as its valuation relative to the closest venture debt lending peers, which have historically traded at premiums compared to the broader BDC universe.” In line with this upbeat outlook, Sherbetchyan sets a Buy rating on TRIN shares, and bumps his price target up to $20.50, suggesting a 12-month upside of 15%. (To watch Sherbetchyan’s track record, click here) Overall, there are 3 recent analyst reviews of this stock, and they all agree that it’s a Buying proposition, making the Strong Buy consensus rating unanimous. The shares are selling for $17.80 and their $20.50 average price target matches Sherbetchyan’s objective.

3/2/2022,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian oil producers are postponing tenders due to a lack of buyers and as importers in Europe and Asia reject Russian ships amid widening disruption from a raft of sanctions imposed on Moscow over the war in Ukraine. The West and many other nations moved quickly to impose sweeping sanctions against Russian companies, banks and individuals following Russia's invasion of Ukraine last week. Moscow calls its actions in the neighbouring country a ""special operation"". Oil producer Surgutneftegaz has added an additional 80,000 tonnes of Urals oil to its March loading schedule at the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk and offered the cargo in a tender, traders said, although previous attempts to sell cargoes via tender have failed. ""March sea exports are not going to be placed. Nobody wants to buy, ship or store Russian oil. It's a big issue,"" a trader of Russian oil said about attempts to sell sea-borne oil. The Malaysian government said a Russian-flagged oil tanker targeted by U.S. sanctions will not be allowed to call at Kuala Linggi port, underlining global pressure to squeeze Moscow-linked businesses over the invasion of Ukraine. Russian energy supplies are not a direct target of the sanctions but there are growing concerns that the country's oil and gas exports will be hit by the fallout from restrictions imposed on other sectors. ""They said, no direct sanctions on energy, but it's still impossible to open up letter of credit for trading operations,"" a trader said Energy firms BP and Shell have abandoned multibillion-dollar positions in Russia, while leading banks, airlines, automakers and more have cut shipments, ended partnerships and called Moscow's actions unacceptable. Russian oil pipeline monopoly Transneft plans to raise oil supplies to 40.3 million tonnes via its network in March, up from the 35.7 million tonnes it supplied in February, the RIA news agency reported. Transneft, which handles more than 80% of the total oil produced in Russia, also plans to increase supplies to China via the ESPO pipeline this month to 2.48 million tonnes from 2.22 million tonnes in February, according to TASS news agency. Russia also plans to export 264,000 tonnes of ultra-low sulphur diesel (ULSD) from the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk over March 1-6 versus 330,000 tonnes in the same period of February, traders said on Tuesday.
