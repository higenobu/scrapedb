1/25/2022,"American Olympic athletes have been told to use temporary ""burner"" phones while in Beijing, WSJ reported. Personal devices may be at risk of cyber-surveillance and malware attacks, officials say. The advisory is one of several security warnings athletes have received ahead of the Winter Olympics. Olympic athletes on Team USA have been told to use temporary ""burner"" phones while in Beijing due to cyber security and surveillance risks, The Wall Street Journal reported. The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee reportedly notified Team USA in December that ""every device, communication, transaction and online activity may be monitored. Your device(s) may also be compromised with malicious software, which could negatively impact future use."" The advisory is one of several security warnings athletes received ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics that begin on February 4. A University of Toronto cybersecurity watchdog recently discovered that China's mandatory app for Winter Olympics athletes has serious security flaws and can ban keywords that are critical of China or comment on Uyghur oppression, The New York Times first reported. Beijing is allowing athletes access to YouTube and Facebook, sites that are normally blocked by China's ""Great Firewall."" Even still, teams from the US, Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Canada have been briefed on the risks of connecting to public WiFi networks, Bloomberg reported last week. The Beijing Olympics committee told the outlet that guidance along these lines is ""completely groundless and these concerns are wholly unnecessary."" The Biden administration announced a diplomatic boycott against the 2022 Beijing Olympics in December, citing human rights abuses such as the Uyghur genocide. In a seminar hosted by Human Rights Watch, athletes were also told not to comment on any human rights issues while in China. ""There's really not much protection that we believe is going to be afforded to athletes,"" Rob Koehler, the director general of the Global Athlete group, said during the seminar, according to Reuters. ""So we're advising athletes not to speak up. We want them to compete and use their voice when they get home."" The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment on the advisory to use burner phones and how this may impact athlete's access to personal social media accounts.

1/25/2022,"Top YouTube trader Meet Kevin said he's sold almost his entire $20 million portfolio of stocks and crypto. He said he's worried that markets have not yet reached ""peak fear"" and have further to fall. Data shows that retail investors were more reluctant than usual to ""buy the dip"" during last week's sell-off. A popular financial YouTuber has said he dumped around $20 million of stocks and cryptocurrencies over the weekend, as the market rout tests the ""buy-the-dip"" impulse of millennial traders. Meet Kevin, real name Kevin Paffrath, has more than 1.7 million subscribers on YouTube and is widely watched by retail investors for his advice on the property and stock markets. He shocked his viewers at the weekend by posting a video saying he'd sold 99% of his portfolio of stocks and cryptocurrencies, worth around $20 million. Paffrath said that – despite the major sell-off in stocks seen over the past two weeks – he thinks markets have not yet hit ""peak fear"" and that declines have further to go. ""I'm worried that we're really just at the 'lifeboat stage' of the Titanic,"" he told viewers. ""We're certainly not at the rescue phase yet."" Stocks have dropped sharply so far in 2022 as investors have braced for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates over the coming year. Bond yields have risen sharply. Tech stocks, particularly unprofitable ones, have been hit the hardest, with the Nasdaq 100 down more than 13% year-to-date. Higher bond yields have made the future earnings of tech companies look less attractive compared to other investments. Retail, or individual, investors have spent the last two years ""buying the dip"" in stocks, a strategy that has paid off handsomely. Yet there are growing signs that amateur traders are losing conviction and are worried stocks won't bounce back as easily from the current rout.

He said he saw similarities between today and the stock market crashes of 1929 and 2000, with investors shunning fundamental analysis of companies in favor of momentum trades. Retail investors were much more reluctant to buy the dip last week than in previous sell-offs, according to data company VandaTrack. There are signs that ""retail fatigue or capitulation is setting in, at least in the tech space,"" Ben Onatibia, senior strategist at Vanda, said. ""Retail investors have been chasing rallies in value sectors like financials and energy."" Paffrath told viewers he plans to get back into the market in around 60 days, when he said inflation may show signs of cooling and the market will have had time to digest the first Fed rate hike, expected in March. ""I'm taking the entire portfolio and I'm trading it, which is extremely risky and I don't advise anybody to do it,"" he said.
