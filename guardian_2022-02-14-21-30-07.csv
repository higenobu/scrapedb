2/14/2022,"Meeting one’s heroes is, contrary to advice, always advisable – depending on how canny you are at picking heroes. So if as a teenager you lionised, say, the notoriously grumpy Van Morrison, then you’ll probably be disappointed. If, however, you’re the kind of person who never grew out of your love for Ivan Reitman comedies, from Animal House to Ghostbusters to Dave, you may have been mocked (by idiots) over the years for your taste, but, man, you are quids in when you meet your man.  As the Guardian’s official 80s movies correspondent, I talked to Reitman multiple times over the years, beginning with a phone interview for the last film he directed, 2014’s Draft Day. When I contacted him again a few weeks later to ask if I could interview him for a book I was working on about 80s movies, he immediately agreed, and talked to me for over an hour, reminiscing about films people had been asking him to reminisce about for over 30 years. He never showed boredom or irritation. If I ever needed a quote, or just had a question, I could email him and he’d reply immediately. Does it really need saying that this kind of behaviour from a genuine Hollywood powerhouse is not exactly typical? I didn’t get to meet Reitman in person until October 2021 when he, amazingly, came to London mid-pandemic to help promote his son Jason’s contribution to the Ghostbusters canon – a testament, it quickly became clear, to his love for his son. We initially met in front of a hotel in Soho, where he and Jason gamely hammed it up in the Ghostbusters car, Ecto-1. It is rule number one of interviewing that you don’t ask for photos with the celebrity, and it is rule number two that, if you absolutely must, you certainly don’t do it before the interview. I smashed those rules to smithereens and asked the surprisingly shy and humble Reitman for a photo with him in front of Ecto-1, and after asking if I was sure I didn’t want one with Jason (nope, sorry), he agreed. How do you convey to someone how much their work meant to you as a child and therefore all your life? Poor Reitman had had nerds burbling to him about this for almost all of his adult life, and I’m afraid I added to the pile of nerds. As I babbled on about how I can recite whole scenes of Meatballs, of Twins, and most of all, Ghostbusters, Jason beamed proudly next to his father, but Reitman himself just seemed overcome. “Gosh, thank you,” he said to me as we walked to the hotel. “That’s so nice – thank you.” Genuine humility is in pretty short supply in most celebrity interviews – so is genuine emotion. But twice Reitman had to break off to cry (once going to the bathroom to pull himself together) as he talked about, first, how proud he was of Jason, and then as he talked about his mother’s time in Auschwitz. Reitman was born in Czechoslovakia in 1946, after his mother and father (who was in the resistance) finally reunited at the end of the war. They fled communist oppression and made it to Canada when Reitman was four, losing pretty much all of their money on the journey. He was happy to talk about Kindergarten Cop for weeks on end, but when it came to discussing his family – his parents, his children – his grief and pride and love were just too close to the surface. There’s nothing more Jewish than weeping with pride over one’s children, or being haunted by the Holocaust, and watching Reitman sit there reach for another tissue, this gentle, tender man felt, not like a director I had revered all my life (one who made Bill Murray a star and Arnold Schwarzenegger into a bona fide comedian), but like someone in my family. I wanted to hug him, but fortunately for him, social distancing rules kept me at a safe distance. What an impressive and brilliant man Reitman was. It’s yet another terrible loss from that generation of self-made Jewish immigrants who shaped American comedy, and a very sad loss of a genuinely lovely man.",Arts/Film,I finally met Ivan Reitman three months ago - my Hollywood hero was a truly lovely man | Hadley Freeman,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/14/ivan-reitman-hollywood-hero-ghostbusters-director-hadley-freeman
2/14/2022,"Love is not love, which alters when it alteration finds. It’s a beautiful sentiment around which to build a Shakespearean sonnet, but in real life not everyone adapts to the dramatic changes thrust upon them in a pandemic with the apparent grace of Kate Garraway. The TV presenter’s husband, Derek Draper, almost died of Covid; he is now back home after months in intensive care, but needs round-the-clock nursing. He can speak, but can’t hold what most people would regard as a conversation. It cannot be the life or the marriage either of them dreamed of in their early 50s. But as she said hopefully at the weekend, she thinks they have found “a new way to be in love”, a relationship of complete trust and reliance. “That’s a positive thing to come out of this, to have that certainty of each other. He and I are very close.”  It’s easily overlooked among the more obviously dramatic ways in which Covid has changed our lives, yet when the history of this pandemic comes to be written, love will deserve its own chapter in the story. The last two years have obviously been tough on the single and the lonely, on those trapped in abusive or just downright miserable relationships, and above all on those bereaved by Covid. But they have not been without challenge, either, for plenty of couples who were rubbing along fine before, only to find that nothing exposes the hidden cracks in an outwardly happy life like a period of intense and unrelieved togetherness edged by fear. For every smug couple trilling that lockdown had brought them closer together, there was probably one either actively longing for their other half to go back to the office, or at the very least feeling the need to take the dog out for extremely long lockdown walks. (While a third of Britons felt their relationships had improved during the pandemic, according to a YouGov survey in the autumn of 2020, one in nine thought it had pushed them and their partner apart). As for predictions of a lockdown baby boom due to all the wild sex couples were bound to start having once they were trapped indoors – well, that gave way pretty quickly to elasticated waists, comfort eating and a birthrate that plummeted in 2020. Like pandas, it turns out humans don’t mate very well in captivity, and perhaps especially not if they already have manic toddlers bouncing off the walls with boredom. Nor is there anything enormously erotic about having a job hanging by a thread, or lying awake at night worrying about money. And then there’s the direct impact not of lockdown but of the virus itself, with all the grief, loss and fear it has brought first and foremost to the bereaved, but also to key workers who have spent their days steeped in death and have come home traumatised – either unable to talk about what they have seen, or unable to stop. Glib talk of “life-changing” injury or illness like Draper’s, meanwhile, obscures the often painful everyday reality of relationships transformed overnight, either by Covid complications or by long Covid; from partnerships of equals into carer and cared-for. Relief that the loved one survived all too often mingles with grief for a future now slipping out of sight and occasional fierce pangs of resentment, followed by guilt for not always managing to live up to the unswervingly loving ideal of Shakespeare’s “ever-fixed mark”. For the clinically vulnerable and those who love them, meanwhile, the government’s breezy insistence on lifting all restrictions at the end of the month spells not relief but fresh anxiety. What is the loving choice if you daren’t bring the virus back home, but have to go back to the office to make ends meet? And yet, at the not-quite-end of it all, here millions of us still are; still together, still faintly dazed by the whole experience, but perhaps with a new understanding forged in crisis of what long-term love is all about. It’s not all Valentine’s hearts and flowers, tables for two and tickets to Paris. It is absolutely about kindness, patience, tolerance and the ability to pull together as a team in times of unexpected trouble. For love is not always love that stays rigidly the same when circumstances around it change. Post-pandemic love is perhaps just as often the kind that good-naturedly adapts, and is flexible enough to withstand a shock.

2/14/2022,"Two-thirds of UK asylum seekers arriving by small boat after crossing the Channel were suffering from hypothermia, according to Home Office data obtained by the Guardian, while hundreds had burns or suspected broken bones. Priti Patel, the home secretary, has repeatedly condemned the new arrivals, who crossed in record numbers last year, urging them to remain in other European countries. Those fleeing persecution say they have no other choice but to undertake the hours-long journeys in dinghies because there are no alternative “safe and legal routes”.  Freedom of Information data for the period January to June 2021, when about 6,000 people crossed the Channel in small boats according to analysis by the Press Association, shows that 4,075 were suffering hypothermia , a dangerous drop in body temperature, when they reached the Kent coast. Some 354 people had petrol or saltwater burns sustained on the journey and 27 were taken to hospital with suspected broken bones shortly after arriving. The Home Office initially rejected the Guardian’s request under the Freedom of Information Act but later agreed to provide data answering some questions for a limited period of six months. Data for the whole of 2021 would likely show many more cases of poor health. In 2021, 28,381 people were recorded as arriving by small boat, up from 8,500 in 2020, 1,800 in 2019 and 300 in 2018. In January 2022, there were 1,341 arrivals, a sixfold increase on the same month last year. Last November at least 27 people drowned while trying to cross the Channel in a flimsy vessel; last week the French coastguard rescued 36 people. Independent inspectors raised concerns about the standard of reception facilities in Kent for small boat arrivals in a report in December, including fears for a girl with a fuel burn which was neglected for two days after arrival, leaving her scarred for life. Asylum seekers are currently processed at Western Jet Foil in Dover following the closure of the nearby Tug Haven facility. According to the Independent, the Immigration Service Union has raised concerns about facilities there, including narrow benches and concrete floors. A new facility for small boat arrivals is due to open this week at Manston, a former military base in Kent, which can process 300 people, the BBC said. Clare Moseley, the founder of Care4Calais, a charity that works with asylum seekers on both sides of the Channel, condemned the lack of safe and legal routes for people to claim asylum in the UK. “To find out that so many crossing in small boats are suffering hypothermia and nasty injuries when none of this is necessary is deeply upsetting. It’s time we offered refugees a safe way to make their asylum claims without risking their lives.” Lucy Moreton, of the Immigration Service Union, said the condition people arrived in after crossing the Channel in small boats was not only traumatic for those suffering hypothermia or other injuries but also for Border Force staff. “It absolutely adds to the pressure that staff are under,” she said. “When you have a child in your arms who is covered in fuel burns you take that vicarious trauma home with you. The pressure on staff is very difficult psychologically.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “People should seek asylum in the first safe country they reach and not risk their lives making these dangerous and unnecessary journeys. We have measures in place to ensure people arriving in the UK via small boats are treated appropriately, this includes onsite medical care and water. Anyone in need of urgent care is immediately transferred to a local hospital.”",News/UK news,Two-thirds of UK asylum seekers on small boats had hypothermia or injuries,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/14/two-thirds-of-uk-asylum-seekers-on-small-boats-had-hypothermia-or-injuries
2/14/2022,"Marathon talks to revive the Iran nuclear deal have hit a new roadblock, with Iran accusing the US of refusing to make the necessary political decisions to entrench the agreement in international law or to broaden the scope of economic sanctions that would be lifted. The issue has dogged the talks in Vienna between the west, Russia, Iran and China – which have been under way since February – from the outset. There is no sign that the eighth round of negotiations, once intended to be the final round, has reached the breakthrough some had been expecting.  Ali Shamkhani, the hardline secretary of Iran’s national security council, in a tweet issued in multiple languages, declared after speaking to his government’s negotiators that progress was becoming “more and more difficult”. Expressing his frustration at the delays, he said: “The Vienna negotiations had reached a point where the outcome could be described definitively without the need for guesswork. “A US political decision to accept the deal or refrain from accepting the requirements of a credible and lasting agreement based on the principles accepted in the nuclear agreement can replace speculation.” The US, he said, kept proposing new initiatives essentially designed to evade their commitments. The foreign ministry spokesperson, Saeed Khatibzadeh, at his weekly press conference tried to calm the atmosphere by saying he had spoken to Iran’s chief negotiator in Vienna, Ali Bagheri, and that he had been assured the position was “neither one of flowers and nightingales, nor one of rocks and thorns”. But he added the onus lay on the US to accept Iran’s terms. Asked what guarantees Iran was seeking, Khatibzadeh said: “The United States is not trustworthy and therefore objective guarantees must be obtained so that international law and relations are not again mocked by the US government.” He added that all sanctions should be lifted at the UN security council. “It does not matter what the title of the sanctions is since they were applied with a false label,” Khatibzadeh said. He stressed that any agreement on the release of political prisoners, including US dual nationals held in Iranian jails, was discussed only in parallel with the nuclear talks. Prof Mohammad Marandi, an Iranian analyst in Vienna thought to be close to the government, also claimed the tensions centred on the range of sanctions that would be lifted as part of the deal. Iran is pushing for all sanctions to be lifted, but the US says some sanctions are linked to human rights and terrorists abuses, and are not linked to the nuclear deal. Mikhail Ulyanov, the Russian ambassador at the talks, adopted a less pessimistic tone. He said the discussions were at a final stage and that “significant progress” had been made. But he has tended to adopt a more positive outlook, adopting a near role of mediator between the US and Iran, one he has maintained despite tensions over Ukraine. Wang Qun, China’s ambassador to the UN in Vienna, also broke silence at the weekend to say the talks were at a concluding stage. The 20-page draft agreement with annexes is largely written, but the outstanding issues show an absolute determination by the Iranian regime to ensure that it appears to emerge from the talks victoriously, having withstood the might of US sanctions. Joe Biden, distracted by the Ukraine crisis, is already facing mounting political resistance from US Republican senators who insist that the president cannot evade Congress by refusing to put any new agreement to a vote. Democrats have said that if the deal was put to the Senate for approval, they did not think the necessary 60 senators would vote to reject it. The Senate is split 50:50, with vice-president Kamala Harris having the casting vote. But the Iranian army’s recent display of new long-range solid-fuel missiles with a range of 900 miles (1,450km) will hardly make it easier for the US administration to sell the deal domestically or to a sceptical region. Iran has also claimed that the US negotiating team – with which it does not meet directly – is riven by divisions on how far to compromise. The agreement is designed to bring the US and subsequently Iran back into the original nuclear deal signed in 2015 from which the US withdrew in 2018. The talks have been held against a backdrop of repeated warnings from the west stretching back months that the talks can only continue for a few more weeks because Iran was coming ever closer to obtaining irreversibly the material and knowledge required to make a nuclear weapon.",News/World news,Iran nuclear deal talks stall as Tehran urges US to accept terms,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/iran-nuclear-deal-talks-stall-as-tehran-urges-us-to-accept-terms
2/14/2022,"At least Lorenzo Insigne will not need to be taught another lesson by his children. He had barely made it back to his car after Napoli’s win over Torino in October when his sons, eight-year-old Carmine and six-year-old Christian, warned him that they would be getting the football out and showing him how to strike a penalty as soon as they got home.  Maybe they had some good pointers. The tame effort saved by Vanja Milinkovic-Savic in that match was Insigne’s third missed spot-kick of the season. Since then, he has converted four out of four. After Inter’s Stefan De Vrij kicked the heel of Victor Osimhen on Saturday, Insigne swept a confident penalty past Samir Handanovic – striking the ball with too much force for the keeper to reach despite diving the right way. The goal took Lorenzo Insigne past Diego Maradona on Napoli’s all-time scoring list, a landmark that somehow felt less vivid than when he had drawn level three weeks before. Back then, after scoring against Salernitana, he had run to the TV cameras and tried to deliver a message to his club’s supporters. His words were hard to make out clearly, but various lip-readers had him telling the club’s fans “I will always be here.” Not in a literal sense, obviously. Insigne’s decision to sign for Toronto FC had already been made public. Insigne’s presumed intention was simply to remind his club’s supporters of his attachment to the team that he plays for and the city where he was born and raised. On the surface, Insigne’s story has parallels with that of Francesco Totti at Roma – a homegrown and lavishly talented forward who grew up to wear the captain’s armband, shattering records and each developing their own signature move. Where Totti had his ‘cucchiao’ chip, Insigne has ‘o tir a gir’, his trademark curling shot around the keeper after cutting in from the left flank. Yet the relationship between player and fanbase has always been different, with a certain coolness that did not exist for Totti in Rome. Insigne reflected on that reality in an interview with the magazine Rivista Undici, published at the end of last year. “Do you want to know what Naples has not understood about me?” he said. “I have a particular character. I know how to joke about with anyone, but at the start I keep my distance. For some fans that comes across as arrogance … It’s just a self-defence. Some people have not 100% understood me. Those who truly know me, know how I am made.” None of which is to suggest a lack of affection for his city. Insigne spoke in the same interview about anti-southern prejudice that exists in Italy and how much it hurts him to hear discriminatory chants from rival fans. His interviewer introduced further layers into the discourse, observing dualities within Neapolitan culture that would make it hard for any player to be loved as unanimously as Totti is by Roma supporters. 📌 Gol numero 1️⃣1️⃣6️⃣ in azzurro per @Lor_Insigne! 💪💙 #ForzaNapoliSempre pic.twitter.com/ItOCncSlBr A bigger discussion than we have room for here, but perhaps helpful in understanding why the response to Insigne’s departure has tended more towards resigned disappointment than soul-searching or profound regret. Fans are less interested in his future than their club’s present. The Ultras who waited outside the team’s hotel before the game against Inter had a singular message for Insigne and his vice-captain, Kalidou Koulibaly: “Listen, we need to win”. Napoli had been presented with a chance to go top of the table, the gap to league leaders Inter down to a single point after their defeat in the Milan derby. It was an opportunity that the Partenopei looked ready to seize when Insigne buried his penalty past Handanovic in the seventh minute. Through the first half, Napoli were dominant. Victor Osimhen, making only his second start since fracturing his cheekbone and eye socket in a game against Inter last November, seemed to be constantly in motion, not so much dragging Inter’s defenders out of position as never letting them find their shape to begin with. Piotr Zielinski chased Marcelo Brozovic into constant retreat and fired a left-footed effort against the post. But an equaliser at the start of the second half transformed the game. Edin Dzeko got his initial connection with Lautaro Martínez’s cross all wrong, heading the ball straight down into the floor. The bounce caught Gaetano Di Lorenzo off-guard, and the defender shinned it straight back to him. Dzeko did not need a third invitation, crashing his shot in off the bar. Napoli would have the best chances to win the game, Handanovic denying Osimhen and Eljif Elmas at his near post, but never recaptured their first-half verve. Inter were content to preserve the draw, though Dzeko remained a threat when Denzel Dumfries or Ivan Perisic found space down the flanks to counter. The game finished 1-1, and a day later Milan beat Sampdoria 1-0 to jump ahead of both teams into first place. Inter, with a game in hand, retain control of their own destiny, but they have taken just five points from their last four games. That is mostly a reflection of their taxing winter schedule – which included a visit to Atalanta as well as the fixtures against Milan and Napoli. But the form of Lautaro Martínez, with one goal in his last nine matches, is also becoming a concern. It was Napoli, though, who left with greater regrets on Saturday, having missed their chance to land a blow on a title rival. Opportunities to compete for the Scudetto do not come along so often in Naples, as Insigne well knows. Reflecting on the various managers he has worked under, he described the three years with Maurizio Sarri as pure joy but confessed that the regret of not winning a league title continued to linger. It was Koulibaly who spoke for the team at full-time, telling Dazn that: “Lorenzo is the symbol of Napoli and we must respect him. I want such good things for him. We still have a beautiful journey to go on together, chasing our dream.” Koulibaly’s presence offered a reason to believe. This was his first start since returning from the Africa Cup of Nations. At times he looked a little sluggish, but a brilliant recovering challenge on Dumfries reminded how decisive he can be. Napoli have enough talent to believe that they can compete for the Scudetto yet, as well as going toe to toe with Barcelona when the Europa League resumes on Thursday. Insigne, the first Italian ever to score at both the Camp Nou and the Santiago Bernabéu in the Champions League, can hardly be intimidated by the stage. Perhaps now would be a good time, though, for an extra session with Carmine and Christian. Napoli’s departing forward has scored four penalties since the dressing down that his sons gave him at the end of the Torino game. But he has only found the net once all season from open play. Lazio 3-0 Bologna, Napoli 1-1 Inter, Torino 1-2 Venezia, AC Milan 1-0 Sampdoria, Empoli 1-1 Cagliari, Genoa 1-1 Salernitana, Hellas Verona 4-0 Udinese, Sassuolo 2-2 Roma, Atalanta 1-1 Juventus",Sport/Football,Inter draw damages Lorenzo Insigne’s hopes of signing off with a Scudetto | Nicky Bandini,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/14/inter-lorenzo-insignes-scudetto-seriea-bandini
2/14/2022,"Warnings from the US that Russian troops are poised to strike at Ukraine are growing more urgent and strident. There can be little doubt of the US’s conviction that Ukraine is at imminent risk, and the number of nations advising citizens to leave the country as soon as possible shows that the warnings are at last being considered credible. But the emphasis on near-inevitable war – and the naming of narrow timeframes when it is expected to happen – is also closing down options for the US and its allies, while opening them up for Russia. Moscow still has the initiative, and the risk is growing that its president, Vladimir Putin, is being set up to achieve a diplomatic victory through pulling the rug from under the western war scare.  There’s been no shortage of speculation over how long Russia can keep its troops on the border without either launching an attack or withdrawing them. But back in November, when Putin first explained the purpose of Russia’s threatening force buildup, he also said it was important for those forces to keep the pressure on “for as long as possible”. Three months on, the question instead is how long the US and its closest allies can keep ratcheting up the warnings of imminent conflict. While previously it would have been hard to cast any retreat by Putin as anything but humiliating failure, it is now the US that stands to be embarrassed, and the credibility of its intelligence disclosures once again shattered, if Russia chooses an option other than invasion – or even simply continues to sit on the border as the dates named by the US come and go. The continuing diplomatic procession to Moscow, meanwhile, brings little obvious benefit. For the most part it repeats arguments Russia has already rejected, and hears complaints from Moscow that are already wearily familiar. There is no indication that insistent cajoling by western leaders and ministers has had any influence on Russia’s plans – even when the French president, Emmanuel Macron, apparently tried to negotiate with Russia by making sweeping promises on behalf of Ukraine and Nato. For now, Russia is continuing to reap benefits from its military deployments. It’s not just citizens and embassy staff that western countries are pulling out of Ukraine. Training missions by US, British and Canadian troops have also been withdrawn – with the specific aim of preventing them getting in the line of fire in the event of a Russian attack. This approach is the polar opposite of the way the west protects the Baltic states, where small contingents from multiple Nato member states are embedded in national militaries precisely to ensure that, in the event of Russian aggression, they are directly and immediately involved. That strategy has proved a striking success. Where in 2016 there was much public discussion of how the Baltic states were potential prime candidates for the next Russian intervention, some people now consider these three countries the safest they have been in centuries. It’s too late to take that approach with Ukraine. As the crisis unfolded, the US and UK almost immediately ruled out direct military support on the ground to Kyiv. Moscow will have been delighted, as once again the west helpfully took Russia’s greatest fears off the table. The extent of support to Ukraine is supposedly limited by the fact that it isn’t a member of Nato, but there’s no shortage of precedents for western powers offering protection from aggression beyond the borders of the alliance. There’s been startlingly little discussion of reducing Russia’s options by declaring no-fly zones and maritime exclusion zones over and around Ukraine, and being visibly ready to enforce them – presenting Russia with the risk of direct clashes with Nato nations if it supports an attack by use of air or sea power. Russia is demanding the withdrawal of Nato from eastern Europe precisely because it presents a deterrent and a constraining factor on its ambitions. Military experts talk of Moscow employing a “compellence strategy” to achieve this – a shorthand for Russia using the threat of force to extract sweeping concessions from the west like a street criminal. But the west is only a helpless victim of this mugging through its own choice. Five months ago, Chatham House published a survey of past successes and failures in dissuading Russia from aggression, titled What deters Russia. The case studies taken from incidents and confrontations over the decades show striking consistency: Russia achieves success when stronger adversaries back down in the face of threats, but retreats if those same adversaries demonstrate the will and determination to protect themselves, their allies or partners. Russia’s network of propagandists, mouthpieces and influencers has been insistently pushing the idea that confronting Moscow risks almost inevitable escalation to nuclear war. That’s obscured the fact that a clash with the US and its allies is the worst-case scenario for Russia, and the prospect is one of the few genuine deterrents for Putin. The possibility of western direct support for Ukraine carries a far more immediate, direct and palpable risk for Russia than repeated warnings of further sanctions. While warning of Russia’s plans to attack, the US and its allies should also be letting Putin believe they might just do something about it.

2/14/2022,"A former team medic for Manchester City died falling 100 metres from a Lake District ridge where he proposed to his wife 27 years earlier. Dr Jamie Butler, from Altrincham in Greater Manchester, fell from the Striding Edge section of Helvellyn when hiking with his wife, Margaret, last year. They had returned to the mountain to find the exact spot where he had asked Margaret to marry him in 1994.  An inquest heard the 54-year-old must have fallen from the mountain amid misty conditions and poor visibility on 2 November. When the couple reached Striding Edge, a rocky scramble before Helvellyn’s summit, Margaret was too tired to continue and so her husband carried on alone, according to a report from the Messenger newspaper in Trafford. In a statement read in the inquest, she described seeing her husband walk off into mist. After a while she shouted after him but received no response and called the police, “concerned something had happened to him”. Mountain rescuers were scrambled to search for the walker and found his body below the ridge. He was found with significant injuries, including a fractured skull, and was later pronounced dead. Butler was well known around the north-west for his work as a sports doctor. After qualifying as a doctor at the University of Liverpool in 1993 he worked at the English Institute of Sport (EIS) and Sale Sharks Rugby Club. He became a medic for Manchester City football club in 2007 and was promoted to senior medical officer in 2009. In 2011, he was cleared of wrongdoing after the defender Kolo Touré was given a six-month ban after testing positive for drugs, according to MailOnline. The inquest heard Butler was facing unspecified historical “allegations” and had been suspended from practice at the time of his death. His doctor said he had shown no intent to take his own life. The coroner, Kirsty Gomersal, accepted a postmortem finding that Butler died as a result of multiple injuries from the fall. Delivering her conclusion, she said: “In my judgment, a conclusion of accidental death is the most appropriate for me to reach. Although there had been allegations against him, he was determined to clear his name and his doctor was sure there was no suicidal intention.” Margaret Butler paid tribute to her husband. “Jamie was a loving husband with two twin boys who he adored,” she said. “He will be forever missed. He died doing what he loved.”",News/UK news,Doctor died after fall from Lake District ridge where he proposed to wife,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/14/doctor-died-after-fall-from-lake-district-ridge-where-he-proposed-to-wife
2/14/2022,"Against our backdrop of revenge porn, dick pic-strewn online dating and embittered incel manifestos, the notion of courtly love couldn’t seem more remote. Cilla Black and Blind Date now seem like something from medieval times – so where does that leave an actual medieval sentimental convention? A goodly knight inspired to perform virtuous deeds and compose the sublimest verse in honour of an idealised lady-love – it’s enough to make a 21st-century onanist yawn and reach for their Fleshlight. But romance and chivalry aren’t quite dead yet. Cyrano de Bergerac is back in a new musical version this month, as Peter Dinklage lends his alexandrines to help a mate woo the beautiful Roxanne. Married off to no-nonsense bruiser Matt Damon in Ridley Scott’s 14th-century drama The Last Duel, Jodie Comer’s sequestered damsel becomes subject to the attentions of courtly smooth operator Adam Driver. And a silky-voiced consort, played by Alicia Vikander, gave Sir Dev of Patel’s mettle the stiffest of examinations in the penultimate trial of last year’s The Green Knight.  All these films may seem like diverting excursions into cobblestoned fantasias, but modern social anxieties beat beneath their plate-iron breasts. Our online lives are just as caught up with appearances and reality as ringletted paramours and knights-errant once were in the “game” of courtly love (at least if you believe the literature). Chivalric romances were filled with a tension between idealised image and inner feeling. This gulf between what was socially valued and desired and how you approach that as an individual is strangely relevant to social media. Medieval lays (no sniggering) were as much about the act of self-presentation – how the lance gleamed, whether deeds were noble, the words well-spoken – as about the love object herself. Monty Python satirised the pretensions of courtly love brilliantly in the Castle Anthrax segment of their Holy Grail film. So when, in the new Cyrano, Peter Dinklage gives pretty-but-dumb musketeer Christian a silver-tongued upgrade to be the suave loverboy Roxane wants, there’s an analogy with the flattering personas and sassy internet-ese we adopt in our digital lives. “I will make you eloquent while you make me handsome,” says Cyrano – who effectively uses Christian as a kind of balcony-vaulting avatar. Or, in Gawain’s anxiety that in failing the lady’s test “he is no knight”, there is a hint of the ultimate online sin: that our real selves will be exposed and found wanting. Poring over our tweets, dallying over our Instagram filters, we’re still vying to be deemed worthy in the court of social media. Or perhaps exposing our real selves is actually what the updated version of the game demands. That’s the positive spin put on the online masquerade by Mamoru Hosoda’s new animation Belle – which draws on another quasi-courtly story, Beauty and the Beast, in which a savage warrior’s noble self is revealed by love. It’s a shame Joe Wright’s blandly tasteful new Cyrano didn’t opt for a contemporary setting – where it could have really played with the dramatic potential of smartphones and dating apps. Courtly love has arguably persisted most strongly in modern times in the romcom, with its yearned-for hotties, eager suitors and codified pageantry; as meet-cutes go, divorced maths teacher Owen Wilson getting hauled on stage to wed jilted megastar J-Lo in this month’s Marry Me is a pretty good one. Maybe the medieval convention keyed in to a timeless human truth that will never lose relevance: that desire operates first through idealised images. Jacques Audiard’s new anthology film Paris, 13th District touches on this with its plotline about a mature student being mistaken for a webcam girl, and its swirling sense that its four lovers are all navigating earthly illusions in search of The One. But it’s interesting to see courtly love return to cinema in unadulterated form at a time when other forms of medieval culture have been making a comeback. During a pandemic that naturally set us thinking back to past pestilences, trendologists noted the likes of #MedievalTikTok (videos often sending up incongruous modern-day formality against tapestry-style backdrops) and bardcore (lute and cornamuse-heavy pop covers). These atavistic throwbacks seemed almost comforting during the disorientating first months of isolation – cultural models harking back to other times marked by malady and social inequality. Ironically, courtly love was originally a kind of response to this rigid hierarchy: often addressed to a ruling lord’s lady, it was a safe outlet for courtiers to express erotic feelings and social-climbing aspirations without threatening the established order. Letting any old keyboard warrior mingle with the once-remote celebrity class, isn’t social media doing a similar job these days? Straining for the three-hanky tragic blow-out, down to packing Christian off to an even more stupid death than in the 1990 Gérard Depardieu version, Cyrano is a bit unimaginative in how it tackles the courtly love tradition. But The Last Duel and The Green Knight retailor it in startling ways that illuminate our times. In the Ridley Scott film, courtly love is revealed as a facade and a brutal form of social currency. Jacques le Gris (Driver) sweet-talking Marguerite de Carrouges (Comer) is the prelude to raping her; in her timeline, when husband Jean (Damon) defends her honour, it is patently more about maintaining his own social standing. It’s a cynical parable fit for own tooth’n’claw era of sexual politics, as #MeToo jousts the patriarchy online and further afield. Meanwhile, in The Green Knight, the issue of his performance in the trial with the lady and the whole courtly ideal turn out to be human vanity – amounting to no more than a glob of semen – when he finally meets his arboreal adversary. As dusk falls on the foliage of the Green Chapel, in his long wait for the Green Knight to stir, we’re meant to feel all the immensity of nature, which renders our daily affairs trivial. Again, we should take heed: the climate apocalypse is coming, and you’re worried about your follower count?

2/14/2022,"Today in a nutshell: Gold for Papadakis and Cizeron in the ice dancing and for Kaillie Humphries in the monobob, while Kamila Valieva is cleared to compete Next up: The finals of the women’s freestyle skiing aerials and the US women’s ice hockey semi-final. Tomorrow we get the women’s downhill and Valieva takes to the ice again  Kamila Valieva of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) has been cleared to compete in the individual event tomorrow due to the “exceptional circumstances” of her case. The Court of Arbitration for Sport said that to ban Valieva while her doping case was ongoing “would cause her irreparable harm”. The three-person Cas panel also ruled that the World Anti-Doping Code was unclear when it came to suspended “protected persons” under 16 years of age and said that a 44-day delay in reporting Valieva’s positive test for the banned angina drug trimetazidine had affected her ability to mount a defence. Sean Ingle has more here. On the ice, there was a golden redemption for France’s Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron who won with a world record score of 226.98, putting behind them the wardrobe malfunction nightmare of 2018. The silver medal went to Victoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC). The retiring duo of Madison Hubbell and Zachary Donohue from the US took bronze at their final Olympics. Kaillie Humphries of the US validated her reputation as one of the best pilots in the history of bobsleigh, surging to victory in the debut of women’s monobob and adding a third Olympic gold to her career haul with a strong chance for a fourth by week’s end. She finished with a four-run combined time of 4min, 19.27 sec to win by 1.54sec, the widest margin in any bobsleigh event in 42 years. Great Britain’s men’s curling team won their match against Switzerland 6-5 with the very last stone of the very last end. At the top of the standings Sweden lead on six matches unbeaten, Team GB have won five from their six, and Canada have won four. There’s another round of women’s matches later on Monday. Canada’s Max Parrot stayed on course for his second gold medal after topping the Big Air qualifying standings. His compatriot and defending champion Sebastien Toutant failed to advance after a nasty crash. On Sunday, Erin Jackson ended the United States’ individual medal drought in speed skating, surging to a historic Olympic gold in the women’s 500m. The 29-year-old former inline skater is believed to be the first black woman to win gold in any individual event at the Winter Games. “Hopefully, this has an effect,” Jackson said. “Hopefully, we’ll see more minorities, especially in the USA, getting out and trying these winter sports. I just hope to be a good example.” Norwegian biathlete Ingrid Landmakr Tandrevold will be heading home instead of competing again in Beijing. Like many athletes in the event she collapsed at the finish line, but said: “I just think I pushed my limits in the altitude and in a tough race, but since I’ve had issues with my heart earlier in my career, we need to be careful and we need to check it out further. I’m not allowed to compete more in these Olympics so I will go home to Norway.” In the men’s team pursuit speed skating the semi-finals on Tuesday will be Norway v Netherlands and USA v ROC. Liu Shaoang of Hungary won the gold late on Sunday in the men’s 500m short track skating. Suzanne Schulting, Selma Poutsma, Xandra Velzeboer and Yara van Kerkhof gave the Netherlands gold in Sunday’s women’s 3,000m relay short track speed skating. Jackie Narracott’s wild ride from bad concussion to unlikely Olympic silver From dodging sheep to the Olympic slopes: GB’s Ryding sets sights on gold Calgary, Irving Jaffee and a time when the Winter Olympics was far from cold China’s Eileen Gu comfortably qualified for the freestyle slopestyle final in third place behind Johanne Killi of Norway in second and Kelly Sildaru of Estonia who posted the best score of 86.15. She was the gold medalist in this discipline ahead of Gu at the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics. The British pair of Kirsty Muir and Katie Summerhayes safely progressed, but Marin Hamill, who crashed and fell after a jump, will return to the US for treatment. With rescheduling, the final runs for that will now be on Tuesday morning. Times are all in local Beijing time.

2/14/2022,"When scientists found women in the remote Faroe Islands had unusually high concentrations of toxic industrial chemicals in their breast milk, it seemed a surprising discovery. The north Atlantic archipelago, which lies between Iceland and the northern tip of Scotland, is far from sources of industrial or chemical pollution. And the chemicals that the 2005 Stockholm University study measured, which included polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), had already been phased out in many countries.  So how did this happen? The chemicals were coming from the ocean or, more specifically, from the pilot whales that make up an important part of the islanders’ diet. PCBs, part of a group of toxic chemicals called persistent organic pollutants (POPs), are able to travel huge distances around the planet through air and water, affecting communities far away from the source of contamination. They make their way into the sea, building up in the fatty tissue of marine animals. Once in the food chain, these chemicals can “biomagnify” as they pass from prey to hunter, reaching higher concentrations in top predators. That is why it can be riskier to regularly eat large marine animals such as tuna – or pilot whales, in the case of the Faroe Islanders – than, say, mackerel, anchovies or sardines. Inuit living in the Canadian Arctic have also been found to have higher POP levels in their blood than the general population of Canada, predominantly due to their diet of fish and marine mammals such as walrus and narwhal. What is happening in Canada and the Faroe Islands is one snapshot of the dangers of a group of chemicals that have, it turns out, an outsized impact on people, wildlife, food chains and entire ecosystems. In the 1920s, PCBs – a family of 209 synthetic industrial chemicals – were developed for use as cooling fluids and flame retardants in machinery, electrical goods, paints and building materials. Stable, non-flammable and heat resistant, the chemicals had multiple uses. But that stability, once such a positive attribute, meant they did not disappear or degrade even long after production had ceased. After peaking in the 1960s, use of PCBs began to decline from the 1970s as the health effects became more apparent and countries banned the chemicals. Scientists started to link PCBs to negative effects on the immune systems of animals and people, endocrine disruption, reduced fertility, neurodevelopmental problems and reduced IQ in children. They have also been classified as a probable carcinogen. Today, most PCBs are found in sealed landfill sites, old electrical equipment and prefabricated buildings made before the 1980s. Unless you live very close to an industrial or agricultural site, your most likely source of PCBs is food. A list of 12 POPs known as the “dirty dozen” – including PCBs and the synthetic insecticide DDT – were banned in 2004 by an international treaty, the Stockholm convention, and more chemicals have since been added. To date, 185 parties have signed the treaty, promising to implement control measures. But even with widespread bans, pollution continues to spread. Some chemicals face production restrictions, such as DDT, which cannot be manufactured or applied as an insecticide in agriculture in most countries but can still be used to control malaria. Others are being eliminated. The treaty calls for PCBs to be phased out in equipment by 2025 and all PCBs to be eliminated by 2028. But so far the treaty has not succeeded in turning off the tap for much of this toxic pollution. Only 17% of the total amount of PCBs has been eliminated worldwide, with 83% (14m tonnes) still to be dealt with, according to the UN Environment Programme. An estimated 1m tonnes of PCB-contaminated material are waiting to be destroyed in Europe alone. The most effective way to get rid of PCBs is by incineration at extremely high temperatures, an expensive and sometimes logistically impossible process. But unless existing stocks of chemicals are dealt with and disposed of appropriately, they will eventually end up in the environment. Already, the ocean acts as a PCB sink but so far, only a tiny proportion of the legacy contaminant has entered the marine environment. As buildings and materials are destroyed and dumped, more PCBs will continue to leach into waterways. The climate crisis may play an aggravating role, speeding up the movement of chemicals around the planet. As temperatures rise, POPs will evaporate even more easily into the atmosphere. In the future, this “grasshopper effect”, by which pollutants evaporate in warmer regions and travel in air currents to cooler places, could have an even greater impact on people, animals and places thousands of miles away from the source of pollution. And history may be repeating itself. Some of the most persistent synthetic chemicals available today, PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), known as “forever chemicals”, could become the PCBs of the future. PFAS make products waterproof and stain-resistant, among other uses, but the chemicals’ strong carbon-fluorine bonds mean they do not biodegrade, accumulating in the soil and water and affecting human health. Polluting PFAS that escape into the ocean often come back to shore when released into the air from the sea-spray aerosols of crashing waves – this “boomerang effect” is further evidence that toxic chemicals do not get diluted by the sea. While legislation is slow, more stringent preventive measures are urgently needed to make sure the emerging pollutants in use today will not become the legacy contaminants of the future.

2/14/2022,"Fittingly for self-distributed works by a true American independent, Patrick Wang’s four features to date stand tall with a graceful and tenacious outsiderdom. Their handmade quality and occasional rough edges may have made them a hard sell, but this seems unfair. There’s a collectivist spirit, moral conviction and self-taught experimentalism at work here – the latter given increasing room to express itself as Wang has gradually untethered himself from realism – that demands attention. Especially impressive is Wang’s 2011 debut In the Family (****) – starring Wang himself as Joey Williams, a Texan interior designer whose partner Cody (Trevor St John) is killed in a car accident. Cody’s will, written long before their relationship, states that his sister Eileen (Kelly McAndrew) should act as guardian to Chip (a beautifully instinctive performance by Sebastian Banes), his six-year-old son by his previous heterosexual marriage. This leaves the devastated Joey, himself a foster kid, flailing for legal options to preserve his relationship with Chip.  Wang – also a theatre director – likes to squat naturalistically in Joey’s household with signature middle-distance long takes. While this makes the 160-minute In the Family a testing prospect, the intimacy he fosters pays off, because you fully comprehend what Joey is fighting for. Wang’s understated approach to this Asian-American life is somewhat similar to last year’s Minari: racism (or homophobia, for that matter) is never explicitly mentioned as the reason why his in-laws suddenly cold-shoulder him. But prejudice subtly lingers in the vicinity: the hospital officiously bars him from visiting Cody in intensive care. As Wang subtly intensifies the style, the legal sparring builds into something truly engrossing and that wields a wily humanistic force. The lesson here is that people power and communication are worth more than systems and legal processes. “Those limits can be distracted. So don’t head straight for them,” says the gentleman lawyer who comes to Joey’s aid. The deposition scene in which Joey displays unflappable southern aplomb deserves to be a legal genre classic. Shorter but offering less substance is 2015’s The Grief of Others (**), adapted from a novel by Leah Hager Cohen. It’s another household affair, with Trevor St John returning; he plays the paterfamilias of the Ryries, who are close to breaking point after a horrific postpartum event. Wang cranks up the formalism here, with the opening stages scattered among various family members and bystanders cradling various degrees of personal agony, and interlude scenes shot red-filtered from the perspective of the deceased. But the drama constantly struggles to grasp the central nub of the trauma, caught between flat behavioural sequences (in which everything is subtext) and ragged melodramatic confessionals. Wang’s theatrical roots are given full rein in the two halves of the playful but empowering 2018 comedy-drama A Bread Factory, an almost Altman-esque sojourn with the team behind a community performing arts centre in the fictional town of Checkford. But Wang is also a former economist, and A Bread Factory Part One: For the Sake of Gold (***) diligently examines the civic value of art. That’s what lesbian couple Dorothea (Tyne Daly) and Greta (Elisabeth Henry), who run the Bread Factory, have to make a case for when a swish rival outfit across town tries to gazump their funding on the back of their new Chinese performance art duo, May Ray. Wang is clearly having great fun with this pair of po-faced chancers, spoofing vapid conceptual pomposity; the same goes for the Chekhov parody performed by one of Bread Factory crew, and another vignette in which a Hollywood heartthrob swans into town. Wang retains the observational neutrality of his other features, but the manic theatricality on stage constantly overflows from the proscenium into the real-life scenes. Wang is clearly a believer in the mutually reinforcing cycle of life and art. A Bread Factory Part Two: Walk With Me a While (****) shows how it’s the work of places such as the Bread Factory to unearth the latter in the former, when the team find a star performer for their production of Euripides’ Hecuba working at a local cafe. By now, the artifice is running amok all over Checkford: a pair of warhorse thespians slip into Russian melancholia over the samovar; cafe patrons tap-dance out their smartphone frustrations; Wes Anderson-style stop-motion sequences show the development work in progress on the play; a clutch of rough and ready chorus-line songs (most written by Wang). But amid this representational frenzy, it’s the simplicity of the Hecuba sequences – spellbindingly performed by Henry and the waitress-turned-actor Teresa (Jessica Pimintel)– that tip the balance back in favour of realism; a sober reminder that the purpose of all this creation is to find truth. As Greta and Dorothea struggle in the rehearsal room and in their private lives, Wang implies that the real worth of art is in giving us the strength to strive and persist. The fact that the box office take for both parts of The Bread Factory combined was $17,325 only proves his point.  The Films of Patrick Wang (In the Family, The Grief of Others, A Bread Factory Parts One and Two) are released on 18 February in cinemas, and are on digital platforms from 21 March.",Arts/Film,The Films of Patrick Wang review – wily humanism of an outsider auteur,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/14/the-films-of-patrick-wang-review-in-the-family
2/14/2022,"De La Soul played a gameshow on 3 Feet High and Rising, kids discussed love on The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, Eminem faced his irate manager on The Marshall Mathers LP, Outkast parodied themselves at a record store on Aquemini, Biggie Smalls actually received fellatio on Ready to Die, and Eazy-E probably didn’t actually receive fellatio on Just Don’t Bite It. There was once a time where skits like these, particularly in the age of tapes and CDs, were a staple of hip-hop. Interspersed between songs, these comedy sketches or spoken-word interludes aimed to bring you deeper into the album, with records such as the Fugees’ The Score showing how poignant this could be (a child being shot at the end of Cowboys) or how puerile (the Chinese restaurant at the end of The Beast). Such interludes were not solely the preserve of rap, though: Meat Loaf’s You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth opened with an attempted seduction on that hot summer night, Destiny’s Child recited lines from the Bible on the outro track to Survivor, and Britney had an ill-fated exchange with an earnest astronaut on Oops! … I Did It Again.  But as digital formats and curated playlists took over, many announced that the album was a dead format and that skits would die with them. Why would you stick a song on, say, a sexy playlist if it had a minute-long monologue from the artist’s grandma at the end? And if it was a separate track on the album, would you not just skip it? Indeed, in his 2015 article charting the history of the phenomenon in hip-hop, writer Jeff Weiss said: “In today’s streaming chaos, few things seem more anachronistic than including skits. That’s just one more way to annoy people unwilling to pay for Spotify Premium”, where you already suffer the interruption of advertising. But the death knell for skits hasn’t sounded – quite the opposite. In its various forms – sketches, spoken-word passages, vignettes, voicemails, voice notes – the skit has played a big role in the recent work of rappers such as Tyler, the Creator, Little Simz, Riz Ahmed, Knucks, Kojaque and Fly Anakin, and artists as varied as Adele, FKA twigs, the Weeknd, Lana Del Rey, Blood Orange, Solange, Frank Ocean, Jazmine Sullivan and Joy Crookes. At their best, these reinvigorate the album form as not just an arbitrary collection of recent songs, but a space for social gatherings and storytelling. The most cynical interpretation is that these extra tracks rack up more listens and, therefore, more money in a broken streaming system (Spotify counts anything over 30 seconds as a play). But many of these moments are part of longer tracks – they’re more likely to be a way of cohering and curating the album format still so beloved by artists, albeit less so by listeners in the age of the playlist. This impulse actually dates back to when producer Prince Paul thought sketches would help bring structure to De La Soul’s debut album; maybe some artists now do skits simply in acknowledgement of what has come before. Kendrick Lamar has long used them as a storytelling device, as on Good Kid, M.A.A.D City with his dad yelling about dominoes: intimacies from Kendrick’s personal life that also aligned him with classic hip-hop. Almost a decade later, the Irish rapper Kojaque used funny skits on debut album Town’s Dead to paint a picture of his own city, Dublin, repeatedly referencing the pizza chain Domino’s in what might have been a knowing nod to Lamar. The skit can amplify nostalgia: the Weeknd frames his new album Dawn FM as broadcasts from an old radio station, with Jim Carrey playing host alongside intermittent adverts that emphasise that this station is playing in purgatory. The skits create the dark, expansive universe of this album, but also pay homage to the past, with the old-school radio stylings and – a little jarring with the rest of the concept – Quincy Jones ruminating on how his childhood trauma affected his own parenting. Given how much the Jones-produced Michael Jackson has influenced Abel Tesfaye, his inclusion is a way for the Weeknd to pay respects while somewhat cheekily (but not unreasonably) inserting himself in that grand lineage, much like Lamar did on To Pimp a Butterfly, where he used an old interview recording to place himself in conversation with the late Tupac Shakur. But it’s not just about world-building or reverence for history. Writing for Pitchfork in 2017, Sheldon Pearce examined the use of answering machine messages in rap songs, noting the “intimacy to these private moments … an unprepared statement is often the most honest”. Pearce breaks down the reasons rappers include such recordings on their albums: narrative, myth building, family business, backstories, warning shots and remembrances. Voicemails became voice notes in the age of WhatsApp, and Adele uses them on new song My Little Love to cover much of Pearce’s list. The glib narrative around Adele’s divorce album 30 was that it would be good because she was heartbroken again – and so including conversations between the artist and her son on My Little Love made that heartbreak specific, its pain and horror reanimated – almost confrontationally so. “I feel like I don’t really know what I’m doing”, she says, her young son replying “Why?”; there is also a tearful voice note to a friend about her loneliness. Adele’s singing voice is otherworldly, but her speaking voice is famously earthy: in using the latter, she shortens the gap between her and us. Though it might feel like an intrusion to hear it – even exploitative of her son – Adele explained that: “I thought it might be a nice touch, seeing as everyone’s been at my door for the last 10 years, as a fan, to be like, ‘Would you like to come in?’” Other family members frequently crop up in pop: Drake, SZA and Joy Crookes all receive advice from theirs between songs. Once we wanted stars to be infallible and superhuman, but now, relatability sells, and these artists are letting us know they’re just as flawed and in need of guidance as we are. FKA twigs uses those relatable voice notes to slightly different ends on her new mixtape Caprisongs, where she explores her more fun, pop, club-going side, sounding freer and more accessible than she did amid the sculptural poise of previous album Magdalene. Part of this comes from feeling as if you’re being invited into twigs’ world – twigs as human, not just performer, with voice notes from her friends offering sweet (sometimes bordering on cloying) affirmations such as: “I wish you could see in you what I see in you, what everyone sees in you, because that’s the golden stuff right there,” twigs told BBC Radio 1’s Clara Amfo in a recent interview: “If people don’t have friends or company, then they can just borrow my friends – they can put on Caprisongs.” Rising artist Raveena even goes so far as to offer a guided meditation at the end of her new album. During two years where our worlds got smaller and we listened alone, and in a culture where identities are strongly forged through fan communities online, artists might populate their albums with these people to help you feel a part of their network – however synthetic that connection. Sometimes the skit takes on a more choric function. Moses Sumney has writers, poets and actors speak directly to the themes he explores more gently in his singing on Græ: multiplicities, relationships and loneliness are brought to life in fascinating murmured chants, almost amounting to a Greek chorus threading together Sumney’s album. Then there’s Janet Mock’s narration on Blood Orange’s Negro Swan, elucidating the themes – living loudly and in love with yourself and your chosen family as a Black or otherwise marginalised person – which might otherwise go unnoticed in the mixtape-y release. It is a natural progression from another powerful treatise on Blackness, A Seat at the Table: alongside Solange’s parents telling stories from their lives, rapper and entrepreneur Master P dotted vignettes that reinvigorated the theme of Black empowerment. There’s a nice collagist feel to these interjections – though some might argue the music should be enough to transmit the ideas on its own. One example of where the music should have done the talking is on Little Simz’s Sometimes I Might Be Introvert, where The Crown’s Emma Corrin channels their Princess Diana performance to portray Simz’s inner voice. She speaks to Simz’s neuroses as her career grows (“One foot out of line and you’ll be ridiculed”), but also offers up hackneyed phrases: “The top of the mountain is nothing without the climb.” Simz has said these interludes exist because she likes Corrin’s voice and the words are “things that everyone should hear”. But they are motorway-legal signposts of the album’s themes, and are ultimately heavy handed, didactic and diminish the way its mysteries might otherwise unfold. On a largely masterful release, these quickly become skippable after one or two plays. A better use is Jazmine Sullivan’s Heaux Tales – rightly nominated for three Grammys this year – where between the engaging R&B jams, a series of women ponder sexuality and self-worth. These are not neat little bromides and positive affirmations – they are messy, funny, utterly vital stories, where Sullivan has a documentarian’s eye for kitchen-sink detail. Ari Lennox is hilarious as she laments her helplessness in the face of an unsuitable but sexually potent partner (“that dick spoke life into me!”), before appearing in sensual duet On It to explore those same tensions. On Donna’s Tale, Donna Anderson is frank about the poisoned economy that underpins so many relationships (“You have sex because you know your husband is gonna give you what the fuck you want the next day”). Unlike twigs’ community, which you never truly feel a part of, Sullivan makes you feel properly included in this circle of wronged, righteous, complicated women. In the same way that artists include guest verses from their peers, Heaux Tales weaves in these voices to strengthen the album’s sense of perspective. The album never died, but people’s consumption of the format has become more ephemeral – and so sketches, spoken word and voice notes are often effective at reversing that trend. Some of them will amuse you, or keep you company for a moment. But Sullivan shows how they can anchor songs into something more visceral, considered and long-lasting: the album as a gallery of ideas for how to live.",Arts/Music,"Sex stories, purgatory and Adele’s tears: the album skit is back",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/14/sex-stories-purgatory-and-adeles-tears-the-album-skit-is-back

2/14/2022,"France elects its next president in two rounds of voting on 10 and 24 April that will determine the course of western Europe’s second-largest country for the next five years.  The full list of candidates will not be known until early March, when the names of those who have gathered the necessary 500 endorsements from elected officials in order to qualify for the first-round ballot paper will be announced. But only a handful have a chance of progressing to the second-round run-off. At present they include Emmanuel Macron, the outgoing president; Valérie Pécresse of the rightwing Les Républicains party; and Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally. Polls suggest that of the other candidates, only Le Pen’s far-right rival, the anti-immigrant TV pundit and polemicist Éric Zemmour, and Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a hard-left veteran, are on course to secure more than 10% of the vote. Much may yet change, however, with 47% of voters saying they are still undecided and 30% that they have changed their minds in the past two months. The relative vote share of the two far-right rivals, in particular, could fluctuate. The election’s outcome will have an impact in France, in the European Union (France is the EU’s second largest economy) and beyond. Since Angela Merkel left office, the liberal, centrist Macron has become the bloc’s most visible leader, a believer in greater “European sovereignty” and an outspoken defender of western values with a clear desire to shape world events. A Le Pen victory would deal a heavy symbolic blow to the EU and be widely seen as a further populist, nation-first threat to the bloc’s drive for greater integration. Pécresse could also oppose further sovereignty-sharing in several areas. To qualify for the first round, each candidate must secure the backing of at least 500 of more than 40,000 MPs, MEPs, senators, regional councillors and mayors from at least 30 different départements and overseas territories. This is not an easy hurdle to clear, and one or more high-profile names may fail to do so. The elected officials’ signatures must be collected by 4 March and the list of candidates must be announced by 18 March. About a dozen are expected to qualify. Assuming – as is virtually certain – that none wins a majority in the first round, the two highest scorers then face off against each other two weeks later. The winner of that second round needs to score more than 50% of the vote. The two-round system, also used in parliamentary, local and regional polls, was introduced in 1962 by Charles de Gaulle and has thus far proved effective at keeping extremists from power: the French say you vote first with your heart, then your head. Macron’s victory in 2017 at the head of a centrist political startup blew up France’s political landscape in spectacular fashion, plunging the combined score of traditional left and right parties of government to a historic low. The Socialist party (PS), which in 2012 controlled the Élysée, parliament and most of France’s regions, was shattered. Its presidential candidate came fifth on 6.4% of the vote, a worst-ever score, and in parliamentary elections it lost 250 of its 280 MPs. According to polls, the French left, including the Green party (EELV), should attract nearly 30% of the vote – more than enough to reach the second round if it was cast for a single candidate. However, it looks likely to be divided between seven or eight. These include Mélenchon, the leader of La France Insoumise (Unbowed France), the only leftwing candidate forecast to reach double figures; the Socialist candidate, Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo; the Greens’ Yannick Jadot; and the Communist Fabien Roussel. Christiane Taubira, a former Socialist justice minister, won a “popular primary” intended to unify the left but since Mélenchon, Jadot and Hidalgo refused to recognise it, Taubira’s candidacy will most likely divide the progressive vote yet further. The conservative Les Républicains (LR) were also hit by the arrival of Macron and his La République En Marche (LaREM), failing in 2017 to make the second round for the first time since 1981. In a France that polls suggest has shifted rightwards, LR are still a potent force. They bounced back strongly in regional elections last year but squeezed on one side by Macron, whose centre-right economic policies appeal to moderate conservatives, and on the other by Le Pen and Zemmour, vying for its more traditionalist and sovereignist voters, the party has little room to manoeuvre. On the far right, the battle between the two rivals could be existential. Le Pen’s efforts to “detoxify” her 50-year-old nationalist party have left her exposed to Zemmour’s more virulent xenophobic rhetoric, leading to defections from the National Rally ranks. More departures – and particularly any formal declaration of support for the TV pundit by Le Pen’s popular, more socially conservative niece, Marion Maréchal – could badly damage her campaign and, some suggest, even herald the end of her party. Observers believe Zemmour’s longer-term aim is the demise of the National Rally and the foundation of a new national-sovereignist movement uniting the far right with the more traditionalist right who cannot bring themselves to vote for Le Pen. Emmanuel MacronFrance’s president, a former merchant banker and economy minister under his Socialist predecessor, François Hollande, is an economically liberal, pro-business reformist, but a progressive on most social issues. Despite his promise to be “neither right nor left”, in office he is widely perceived as having drifted rightwards. He has also suffered from a reputation for arrogance and aloofness that he has tried to temper. Marine Le PenThe leader of the National Rally wants to end immigration, slash crime, eradicate Islamism and save France from globalisation, but has rowed back on plans to pull it out of the EU. Her “economic nationalism” would favour French business, while “France-first” social policies in housing, health, education and employment would favour French people. There are signs that her drive to sanitise the party founded by her father, Jean-Marie, in 1972 has cost her some of its traditional support. Valérie PécresseThe president of the greater Paris Ile-de-France region, the candidate of the rightwing Les Républicains is a former budget minister and has described herself as “two-thirds Angela Merkel and one-third Margaret Thatcher”. Socially conservative (she was heavily involved in anti-gay marriage protests, although has since said she will not revisit the issue), she has tacked towards the hard right on immigration but remains relatively centrist by LR standards on the economy. Eric ZemmourA far-right TV polemicist who has convictions for inciting racial hatred and promotes the “great replacement” theory that Muslim immigrants will “replace” the populations of European countries, Zemmour has won a following for his violent diatribes against immigration. His book on the supposed “decline” of France has been a bestseller. Jean-Luc MélenchonThe outspoken leader of La France Insoumise party was a junior Socialist minister from 2000 to 2002 and has campaigned for a shorter working week, lower retirement age, higher minimum wage, benefits and top tax rate, and the end of the presidential regime of the Fifth Republic. Analysts believe he may struggle to match his 2017 campaign, when he polled almost 20%. Yannick JadotThe choice of Europe Ecologie Les Verts (EELV), France’s Green party, Jadot withdrew in 2017 to boost the flagging chances of the doomed Socialist candidate but is now aiming to transfer the success his party enjoyed in 2020’s local elections, when they picked up several big city halls, to the national level. He is campaigning for what he has called “concrete ecology in action”: green solutions for commuting, housing, food, rebuilding local economies. Anne HidalgoThe first female mayor of Paris has highlighted her working-class, Spanish-immigrant roots and promised to improve salaries, particularly for teachers. Although her green, car-free policies were popular enough to win her a second mayoral term, she may struggle to shed her image as “too Parisian” for the rest of France, and her campaign is suffering from deep divisions in the Socialist camp. Christiane TaubiraThe former Socialist justice minister is a talented orator of French Caribbean ancestry who pushed through France’s gay marriage law in the face of appalling racist insults. She has not so far unveiled a policy platform. Polls show Macron winning the first round by a margin of about seven points over Le Pen, who is marginally ahead of Pécresse. Zemmour is three or four points behind, with the leftwing candidates headed by Mélenchon trailing. In the second round, Macron is predicted to beat Le Pen by about a dozen percentage points, and Pécresse by about half that margin. A lot, however, can still change. French presidential election campaigns have a history of throwing up unexpected events that have sometimes dramatically influenced results. France holds legislative elections, also over two rounds, on 12 and 19 June – and without a majority in parliament a French president’s powers are limited. Even if Macron is favourite for the presidential poll, his LaREM party has failed to build grassroots support and polled disappointingly in regional, local and European elections. Many analysts foresee a splintered parliament possibly requiring complex negotiations and alliance-building to secure a majority.",News/World news,French elections 2022: what could happen when country heads to polls?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/french-election-2022-polls-macron-le-pen-pecresse
2/14/2022,"The UK tax department has seized three non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as part of an investigation into a suspected VAT fraud scheme involving 250 fake companies. HM Revenue and Customs said on Monday it had seized the NFTs and arrested three people on suspicion of attempting to defraud it out of £1.4m. It is the first time a UK law enforcement agency has seized an NFT.  NFTs are unique digital tokens that first appeared in 2014 and can be bought and sold in crypto or traditional currencies but which have no tangible form of their own. Nick Sharp, HMRC’s deputy director economic crime, said the NFT seizure “serves as a warning to anyone who thinks they can use crypto assets to hide money from HMRC”. He said: “We constantly adapt to new technology to ensure we keep pace with how criminals and evaders look to conceal their assets.” HMRC said it had secured a court order to seize the three digital artwork NFTs, which have not yet been valued, and other crypto assets worth about £5,000. The suspects are alleged to have used “sophisticated methods to try to hide their identities including false and stolen identities”, HMRC said. Jake Moore, an adviser at the cybersecurity firm ESET, said the seizure showed the police are fast adapting to the threat of cybercrime and how to seize digital assets that are designed to avoid law enforcement. “A key element of cryptocurrencies’ design is to keep them secure and protected against interception by anyone, whether that be a threat actor or law enforcement,” Moore said. “But with a fast-moving digital world where mistakes can be made, police forces are beginning to buck the trend in how they investigate digital crime, locate evidence and finally seize digital assets. “Confiscation also comes with a very tempting reward due to the Proceeds of Crime Act where the investigating police force can request to keep half of the forfeited goods and the other half will go to the Home Office. So with digital currencies, this can be extremely appealing indeed.” The market for NFTs grew to an estimated $22bn (£16bn) last year. Data from DappRadar, a firm that tracks sales, showed that trading in NFTs reached $22bn in 2021, compared with $100m in 2020, and that the floor market cap of the top 100 NFTs ever issued – a measure of their collective value – was $16.7bn.",News/Technology,HMRC seizes NFTs for first time amid fraud inquiry,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/14/hmrc-seizes-nfts-for-first-time-amid-fraud-inquiry
2/14/2022,"In the summer of 2012, Wendy was making her annual trip from her home in Austin, Texas, to Phoenicia, New York, where she owned a small cabin outside the town. “I inherited it from my great-grandmother and have been going there since I was a kid,” she says. “I love eating and drinking in the local restaurants there.” That year, she decided she would like to cycle to and from the town centre during her stay. “I didn’t have a bike, so my friend suggested I rent one in town. The shop was tucked away and I didn’t even know it existed.” She walked in and met the owner, Mike, who also ran the shop as a hangout space. “I’d lived off the grid most of my life so it was nice having a social place to be with people,” he says. He found her a bike to rent, but was worried she wouldn’t make it home. “It’s very hilly and I wasn’t used to cycling,” she says. “He gave me his number in case I needed him to pick me up.” Wendy made it home safely, then called Mike to let him know.  A few days later, he asked if she would like to join him and a friend on a bike trail across the Hudson. “I really liked the conversations we had and I was impressed with how relaxed she was using curse words, too,” he laughs. After the bike ride, Wendy invited them both to her cabin, to sit on the front porch with a drink. “It’s one of the most relaxing places in the world,” says Wendy. “Mike really liked it there and we spent hours chatting.” She tried to return the bike, but Mike insisted she keep it a little longer. In July, she had to travel back to Texas for an event. “I’d had the bike so long by that point, I thought I’d run up a big bill,” she says. “But Mike didn’t charge me. He just asked if he could visit my cabin and sit outside the front porch while I was away.” When she returned a few weeks later, she considered going to see him, but didn’t want to seem too forward. “My neighbour told me his face lit up when they said to him that I was coming back. It was like high school for seniors,” laughs Wendy. After meeting up again at a local music event, they began going for regular bike trips together, but it wasn’t until September that things became romantic. “It was also complicated by the fact I was going back to Texas for the winter.” Still unsure if their relationship would prove to be more than a summer fling, Wendy returned home. But they stayed in touch and she visited for a week in October. At Christmas, she stayed for a month but Mike, who had already been suffering from hepatitis C, had some more bad news about his health. “I had been waiting for a biopsy for suspected liver cancer,” he says. “When the results came through and the cancer was confirmed, I had to decide whether to go on the transplant list.” Wendy told him she’d be there for him, no matter what he decided. “That’s when I knew she was a keeper,” he says. Over the next three years, he went through chemotherapy and treatment for his hepatitis, before deciding to go ahead with the transplant in 2016. Since his recovery, the couple have divided their time between Phoenicia and Austin. Mike has one son from a previous relationship and six grandchildren, while Wendy has three stepchildren from a previous marriage and 12 stepgrandchildren. “I’ve lived alone most of my life but now I love having Wendy to help me make decisions,” says Mike. “We share similar values and it’s reassuring being with someone who cares so much about you.” Wendy appreciates his calm nature. “He takes care of a lot of things for me without me even asking. I have a live-in Mr Fix-It,” she says. “When you meet someone in your 60s you don’t meet each other’s parents or early friends. A lot of our relationship has been spent catching up on past history. Whenever old songs come on the radio, we tell each other where we were when we first heard them. We have a great time together.” Want to share your story?

2/14/2022,"In 1982, I started work, joined a union and bought my first Tottenham Hotspur season ticket with my first week’s wages. As a bolshie teenager I figured before too long that I could rely on the three S’s: Spurs, the Smiths and socialism. They’ve all let me down since.Yet I continue to fork out on a season ticket, just as my dad and his dad did, along with thousands of other Jews who lived alongside them in Stepney and Whitechapel. My son is following the tradition. After 2,000 years of suffering, what’s a few more decades?However, unlike his dad and previous generations, his experience at Spurs is unlikely to include the kind of antisemitism we faced from away fans, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s. The Chelsea fans singing: “I’ve never felt more like gassing the Jews,” the West Ham fans with their version of I’m Only a Poor Little Sparrow, which included the Y-word and also the line “I hit him with a brick”.Spurs fans, mostly non-Jewish, adopted the Y-word in their own chants as a form of defence and defiance. If we owned the word, then its use by others would cease to be so offensive. But in recent years, the whole Y-thing has become the subject of increasing debate about whether it is time to drop it from chants, particularly those emanating from the Park Lane end.On Thursday, Tottenham put out a long and, it must be said, well-argued and considered statement calling time on the use by fans of the Y-word. It claimed most of the 23,000 supporters who took part in a club survey were, at the very least, uncomfortable with its use. I suspect many of them are from the greater Spurs diaspora rather than those who go to matches – particularly away games, where songs such as The Thing I Love Most is Being a Y** and Y** Army are sung by, if not the majority, then a substantial minority.  It’s no surprise that Tottenham have acted now. Football is trying hard to eliminate racism and discrimination and the club, quite naturally, feel chanting the Y-word is incompatible with this.For what it’s worth, I don’t chant it, but that’s not because I object. It’s because I sit in the section reserved for grumpy old men who spend the whole game kvetching about players and their inadequacies. I have always been defensive about our use of the word against those who campaign to ban it, notably David Baddiel, a Chelsea fan with whom I agree on almost every other matter pertaining to antisemitism. I’ve felt the chants, and the spectacle of thousands of non-Jewish Spurs fans identifying with Jews, to be a source of pride. For me, it spoke to inclusivity, acceptance and solidarity. But when I speak to Jewish friends who obstinately support other teams – mostly Arsenal, some West Ham – they tell me they genuinely feel uncomfortable about the chants. And that makes me feel uncomfortable about its wider impact, however it feels to us in the stadium at Tottenham.It is hard, perhaps impossible, to dictate to a football crowd. So don’t be surprised if official disapproval results, for a while at least, in the chants being voiced more loudly than ever. If they peter out, it will be because something equally scabrous but less culturally loaded replaces them. I won’t be sad. Perhaps it’s time.
