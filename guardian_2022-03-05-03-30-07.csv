3/5/2022,"Ed Sheeran has been accused of being a “magpie” who allegedly “borrows” ideas from other artists for his songs on the first day of a three-week copyright trial over his hit single Shape Of You. Sheeran, 31, appeared at the high court on Friday for the dispute with two musicians who claim Shape Of You – the UK’s bestselling song of 2017 and the most streamed song in Spotify’s history – plagiarises parts of their earlier song Oh Why. Musicians Sami Chokri and Ross O’Donoghue allege Shape Of You infringes “particular lines and phrases” of their 2015 composition. Sheeran and his co-writers, Steven McCutcheon and John McDaid, have been barred by music licensing body PRS for Music from collecting an estimated £20m in royalties from the performances or broadcasts of Shape of You. Legal proceedings began in May 2018, with Sheeran and his co-writers asking the high court to declare they had not infringed Chokri and O’Donoghue’s copyright. Sheeran also said his reputation had been sullied by the allegations. Two months later, Chokri and O’Donoghue issued their own claim for “copyright infringement, damages and an account of profits in relation to the alleged infringement”. Both parties anticipated costs in the region of £3m between them. Andrew Sutcliffe QC, for Chokri and O’Donoghue, said the question at the heart of the case was “how does Ed Sheeran write his music?” and whether he “makes things up as he goes along” during songwriting sessions. The barrister said: “Or is his songwriting process in truth more nuanced and less spontaneous … involving the collection and development of ideas over time which reference and interpolate other artists. This is the defendants’ case. “Mr Sheeran is undoubtedly very talented, he is a genius. But he is also a magpie. He borrows ideas and throws them into his songs, sometimes he will acknowledge it but sometimes he won’t.” Sutcliffe said this “depends on who you are and whether he thinks he can get away with it”. Sheeran has already given the writers behind TLC’s 90s hit No Scrubs a credit on Shape of You after comparisons were made between the two songs. Sheeran’s lawyers previously told the high court that the singer and his co-writers have no recollection of having heard the song Oh Why before the legal battle and “vehemently deny” the allegations of copying. Ian Mill QC, for Sheeran and his two co-writers, questioned the difference between allegedly subconsciously or consciously copying the hook of the song Oh Why. “How can more than one person subconsciously copy something? That is completely inconceivable,” Mill told the court. He added that a case of “conscious copying” against Sheeran and his co-authors would require “all three to have known at the time of writing that they were copying Oh Why”. Sutcliffe said the case was not about “how famous the claimants are, it boils down to that the defendants are not … Shaggy, Coldplay, Rihanna or Jay-Z, if they were they would have been treated in a very different way”. The current trial before Mr Justice Zacaroli continues, with judgment expected to be reserved until a later date.",Arts/Music,"Ed Sheeran is a ‘magpie’ who ‘borrows’ ideas, copyright trial hears",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/04/ed-sheeran-is-a-magpie-who-borrows-ideas-copyright-trial-hears
3/5/2022,"On Thursday evening, Boris Johnson tweeted new sanctions on “Kremlin associates … to inflict maximum economic pain on Putin and his war machine”. The prime minister claimed to MPs he is leading the west in punishing the Russian president for his invasion of Ukraine. But Mr Johnson’s actions show he is lagging some way behind. The European Union and the United States have targeted many more of Vladimir Putin’s cronies – and are moving swiftly to take control of their assets. Earlier this week, France seized a superyacht linked to Igor Sechin, the boss of Russia’s largest oil company and an oligarch who Britain has yet to sanction. Left untouched in Britain are the mansions and art collections amassed by wealthy Russians. No wonder many think these assets risk being spirited away. Russian oligarchy has its roots in the western-inspired reforms of liberalisation and privatisation that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. From August 1990, Russia was subjected to a form of economic shock therapy which saw the wealth created by millions and owned by the state either frittered away or captured by a small group of individuals. That created the yawning divides in Russia today. Post-pandemic, just 500 Russians control more wealth than the poorest 115 million Russians. Britain’s political and business model did very well from Moscow-linked money. The Conservative party has been given about £2m since 2012 by a former Russian minister’s wife. Oligarchs liked the City so much it was nicknamed Londongrad. The Square Mile offers anonymity. Its rules can be dodged and are policed by poorly funded watchdogs. An army of lawyers, accountants and public relations consultants can be hired. Tax and libel laws favour the rich. Given the public mood, however, it is unlikely they will be prepared now to litigate for Russian money. Mr Johnson has to end the era of oligarchal cash. But he is going about the business slowly for fear of putting off other rich foreigners. Ordinary Russians are unlikely to lose much sleep if the oligarchs lose out. But they will be hurt in a wider economic war with the west. Sanctions aim to destroy Moscow’s ability to defend its currency – leading to pain for Russians as interest rates jumped from 9.5% to 20% in a day. The US is severely limiting Russia’s hi-tech imports. Consumers will suffer if factories cannot source key inputs. Big brands such as Ikea are already pulling out, affecting thousands of workers. But for every action there will be a reaction. Halting the supply of aircraft or vehicle parts might see Moscow retaliate by limiting mineral exports necessary for their manufacture. Mr Putin could refuse to pay off his country’s foreign debts. It is absurd to finance Russia’s ability to wage war by buying its oil and gas, but Europeans have little choice in the short term unless they want to freeze. Sanctions may also help Mr Putin convince his population that economic woes are the result of a hostile west rather than his disastrous war. More countries could unsubscribe from the western-led financial system, rendering empty the threat of exclusion. The longer fighting in Ukraine continues, the more profoundly the global economy will be rewired – and not perhaps in a good way. Nicholas Mulder, the author of The Economic Weapon: The Rise of Sanctions as a Tool of Modern War, wrote in the Guardian that “expanding the use of sanctions risks further destabilising the world economy”. He said Keynes a century ago thought the lesson after the first world war was that “positive assistance to the injured party” was more profitable than “reprisals against the aggressor”. Today that would mean doubling down on humanitarian, security and economic aid for Ukraine. Which is not a bad idea at all.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on economic war with Russia: target oligarchs not ordinary people | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/04/the-guardian-view-on-economic-war-with-russia-target-oligarchs-not-ordinary-people
3/5/2022,"“Art should be genderless”, the cinematographer Ari Wegner told the Guardian in a joint interview with film director Jane Campion. The pair are both up for Oscars for their work on The Power of the Dog, the western based on a 1967 novel by Thomas Savage, which is the deserving frontrunner in advance of the ceremony later this month, with 12 nominations. The film, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, is a subversive and visually stunning story of disturbed domestic relationships on a Montana ranch, which turns inside out the macho conventions of one of cinema’s classic genres. Desire, sexuality and the complex forms of attachment between people are, as in Campion’s previous films, including her masterpiece The Piano (for which she won a best screenplay Oscar in 1994), the heart of the matter. Campion and Wegner, like many other female artists before them, reject the pigeonhole labelled “woman film-maker”. Their vision reaches beyond individual identities and experiences. Wegner’s call for “genderless” art recalls the philosophy of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who wrote in 1832 that a “great mind must be androgynous” – an idea later picked up by Virginia Woolf. Campion’s remarkable feats as a female director should also be noted. If she wins this year’s award for best director, she will be only the third woman to have achieved this (after Kathryn Bigelow in 2010 and Chloé Zhao last year). If Wegner wins for her cinematography, she will be the first woman ever to do so (she is the second to be nominated). While women have appeared in front of cameras since cinema’s earliest days, and female film stars have long been among the world’s most recognised faces, behind the camera it is a different story. Directing and shooting films are jobs that remain remarkably male-dominated. In 2020, just 16 of the top 100 grossing films were directed by women. In 2018, it was just four. It is in no way to diminish Campion’s achievements, or those of the female cinematographer she sought out for this project, to describe her as a trailblazer for women as well as for New Zealanders. From her first film, Sweetie, and its follow-up An Angel at My Table, based on the memoir of the writer Janet Frame, Campion has not only broken new ground but built bravely on it, producing striking interpretations of literary sources such as Savage, Frame and Henry James, as well as original screenplays. Her writing, casting decisions and direction have led to memorable performances from actors including Holly Hunter, who appeared first in The Piano and later in the 2013 television drama Top of the Lake. Campion says she doesn’t know whether the campaign for more diversity in cinema and the other arts, following the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, explains recent shifts in the Academy’s tastes (including Zhao’s success with Nomadland). But in a year that has also featured Maggie Gyllenhaal’s The Lost Daughter and Pedro Almodóvar’s Parallel Mothers, the 67-year-old Campion is not the only film-maker who has seized the moment to tell stories about families in new ways. Cinema is all the richer for her gaze.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Jane Campion: the power of the director | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/04/the-guardian-view-on-jane-campion-the-power-of-the-director
3/5/2022,"An extended visa scheme to allow more people from Ukraine to join relatives in the UK has been launched by the government, but plans for a humanitarian refugee scheme to help those without family ties in Britain have yet to be announced. The Home Office said it had increased its weekly visa processing appointments in the region from 500 to 6,000 a week to speed up applications from individuals hoping to join relatives in Britain, and increased the amount of time people will be allowed to stay in Britain from one to three years. Officials said it was too soon to say how many people would apply. With the UN reporting that 1 million people have already left their homes in Ukraine, and warning that 4 million could flee the country if the conflict escalates, refugee organisations called on the government to speed up the announcement of a wider humanitarian scheme. Officials have promised that an “unlimited sponsorship route” will open soon for Ukrainian’s without family ties here, allowing communities, local authorities and others to sponsor and support those in need to come to the UK, but say that details of how it will operate are still being worked out. The British Red Cross welcomed the family visa announcements, but called for the government to allow Ukrainians to travel here without a visa, “in line with the approach taken in the EU”, adding it is “vital that people who don’t have family in the UK are able to get here safely too”. Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said it was not yet clear whether the schemes being devised by the government would match those already announced by the EU. “Any Ukrainian who wants to get to the UK should be able to do that through a safe and immediately accessible route. The most effective way would be to grant them humanitarian visas, to allow them to come as a refugee and be entitled to all the support that they need.” The Ukraine family scheme will allow parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren and siblings of British nationals and people settled in the UK to join relatives in the UK; they will be granted the right to work and to claim benefits. The scheme is radically different from the evacuation programme launched in response to the Afghanistan crisis in August, because officials assume that those who apply will stay with relatives and are not proposing to block book hotel rooms to accommodate them. More than 250 British immigration lawyers have come together to offer pro-bono assistance to people applying for visas; CJ McKinney, coordinating the Ukraine Advice Project, said dozens of emailed requests for help were coming in every hour. Support local charities There are several Ukrainian charities working on the ground. Sunflower of Peace is a charity that helps paramedics and doctors, and has been fundraising for supplies, which includes first aid medical tactical backpacks. United Help Ukraine focuses on providing medical supplies and humanitarian aid, and raising awareness of the conflict. Voices of Children aims to help children affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, providing support through art therapy, psychologists, video storytelling and a number of other methods. The British Red Cross has launched an emergency appeal to help Ukraine. The charity will be updating its webpage with news on the work its team is doing, and how support will be used to help people. Support local journalism English-language news outlets based in the country, such as Kyiv Independent and the New Voice of Ukraine, are covering developments on the ground as the conflict unfolds, using local journalists. The Kyiv Independent says it was created by journalists in order to defend editorial independence. This site on Twitter covers many local journalists in Ukraine. Write to your local MP This can be a way to lobby the British government to place further sanctions on the Russian government and its associates. You can get in touch with your local MP via email or post to their constituency address. Instructions on how to get in touch can be found on parliament.uk. The home secretary, Priti Patel, visited Poland to look at the UK’s visa processing systems on Friday, and said: “While we want people to be able to return to their homes at the end of this diabolical invasion, giving thousands of people a route to the UK is the right thing to do.” Despite the launch of an expanded scheme, several Ukrainians trying to flee to the UK told the Guardian of difficulties they were having in obtaining visas. Yakiv Voloshchuk, 60, a British citizen, rescued his Ukrainian wife, Oksana Voloshchuk, 41, and their diabetic daughter, Veronika, 15, from Poland’s border with Ukraine on 26 February and drove them to the UK visa centre in Paris. They began to queue for a visa for Oksana and Veronika on Monday morning but say that even though they were eligible for the earlier visa scheme announced by the Home Office, on Sunday evening Oksana and Veronika still have not obtained their visas. The family is becoming increasingly desperate and is running out of money. Adil Arslan is a British citizen living in the UK with his Ukrainian wife, Tetiana Hill, but her children, Maksym and Alina, Arslan’s stepchildren, are stranded in Ukraine, spending much of their time sheltering in an underground bunker. No visa has yet been granted even though the scheme announced on Friday includes stepchildren. The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has said there should be a more flexible “emergency protection visa”. “People need a simple and safe route to sanctuary right now,” she said.",News/World news,Extended visa scheme launched to let Ukrainians join family in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/extended-visa-scheme-ukrainians-join-family-in-uk-russia-ukraine
3/5/2022,"The first week of Vladimir Putin’s invasion into Ukraine has not gone to plan, with the Russian military admitting the deaths of 500 soldiers (Ukrainian estimates are higher) and western sanctions dealing a body blow to the Russian economy that will only grow worse in the coming weeks. And yet the Russian leader seems even more invested in his campaign to conquer Ukraine, lured in by the growing stakes of the most ambitious and dangerous gamble of his 22 years in power. “Putin’s in the corner,” said Andrei Kolesnikov of the Moscow Carnegie Centre. “It’s him against the whole world.” Despite some early defeats, Russia maintains military superiority in Ukraine, where its firepower is likely to give it the edge as the war continues. But the question remains how far Putin is willing to go in bombing Ukrainian cities, in resisting western sanctions, and in punishing those at home who dare to call for peace. Much further, say Kremlin watchers. “I think it’s going to get worse,” said Kadri Liik, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “For Putin, the incentive is to escalate. He has gone all in. I cannot see him modifying his war because that would be a loss in his eyes.” Any chance to come to an agreement with western powers had probably passed, she said. “And I think it’ll be pretty full-blown dictatorship at home. You can see it coming.” Western officials believe the risks are high for the Russian leader. While the rule of thumb in diplomatic circles was that Putin would be in power for the next decade, his appetite for risk has raised questions about whether he could provoke a public backlash or an elite power struggle earlier, especially as Russia’s economy enters recession. For now, all the public data suggests Putin enjoys popular support for the war – in which the major cities of Kharkiv, Kyiv and Mariupol have been shelled. Employees of several Russian pollsters have said that they are concerned that the robust numbers in support of the war could embolden the Kremlin and prolong the conflict. Russian state television has largely stuck to its script that the “special military operation” is going according to plan. State TV hosts have decried “fakes” about the Russian army enduring heavy losses, or missile strikes against population centres, trying to get a step ahead of the disturbing images coming out of the war through social media. And with an eye to a potential backlash over the war, Russian lawmakers have passed a tough new law that carries a punishment of up to 15 years for publishing “fakes” about the Russian military, meaning information not distributed by official sources. It is clear that the Russian government has always been worried how this war would be perceived by the public, especially if it begins to go poorly. “Maybe some people can open their eyes and see that it is Putin who is responsible for the situation and his ambitions are not the ambitions of the whole nation and the war was in vain, the war was unjust,” said Kolesnikov. “But that’s only a hypothesis because for now, most of the people support this operation.” Putin has put his top advisers on television to imitate a public discussion about a war that has been a surprise for many Russians. Beyond selling the war to the public, the televised show also tied many of those officials closer to Putin, making it harder for them to later denounce the war or act as if they had not lobbied for it. “You can’t discuss the situation in rational terms,” said Kolesnikov. “All these people at the very top are in one boat, one submarine with Putin and they don’t have an exit from it right now.” While some have whispered about dissent in the Kremlin ranks, a few western officials have openly called for it. In an extraordinary statement, Lindsey Graham, a US senator from South Carolina, asked: “Is there a Brutus in Russia?” “The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out,” he said in a tweet. Dmitry Peskov, a Kremlin spokesperson, called the remarks a “massive hysterical Russophobic fit.” But they will fit neatly into the Russian propaganda about the recent sanctions, which Russia claims are aimed more at punishing Putin and seeking regime change than in trying to end the war in Ukraine. The war will now enter its second week. Nato’s Jens Stoltenberg has warned that the coming days are “likely to be worse” as Russia begins to turn to its advantage in air power and artillery to break into resisting cities. And after Putin spoke with Emmanuel Macron, a French official said that Putin was “prepared to go all the way”.",News/World news,Russia appears to have no way out as Putin goes ‘all in’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russia-appears-to-have-no-way-out-as-putin-goes-all-in-ukraine
3/5/2022,"Nesrine Malik’s comment has one further compelling dimension to it: seeing this horror in Ukraine and all conflicts through the eyes of children (Let the horror in Ukraine open our eyes to the suffering of war around the world, 1 March). Fright, despair and bewilderment are etched on every face that appears on TV or in the papers. Adults should be ashamed of what we are doing to these innocents all over the world. Malik is right. We are appalled by what is happening in Ukraine, yet appear to ignore or be indifferent to other conflicts. Millions of children are frightened and starving to death in Afghanistan because of sanctions imposed upon a new government. Millions are frightened and starving in Yemen, where western arms support allows Saudi Arabia to cripple food supplies. Children in Syria are frightened and hungry as the civil war drags on. Iraq is failing and the children suffer. In Africa, starvation and fear permeate the continent in places such as Nigeria, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan. And everywhere the faces of children are a fierce and damning testimony to adult behaviour.Michael NewmanShefford, Bedfordshire  Nesrine Malik writes that the bloody Russian invasion of Ukraine should open our eyes to other more distant wars, but she does not mention that some of those wars have been started by our own governments in the west. The invasion and occupation of Iraq (“shock and awe”, as they boasted) reportedly led to up to 1 million deaths, as well as the birth of Islamic State; the invasion of Libya, which was supported by Nato, has caused turmoil and misery in the region. The long-term effects of the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan, which Nato also supported, are now clear to see. Food for thought.Brigid KeenanBatcombe, Somerset  Nesrine Malik’s article on an accepted view in the “west” that wars only happen to poor and uncivilised people partly explains why there is such a lack of coverage of the war in Yemen, which the UK government is supporting in supplying arms to Saudi Arabia. Where is the outrage at the humanitarian catastrophe that is happening there? Recent sanctions imposed by the US are going to further cripple efforts to deliver humanitarian aid to areas of Yemen under the Houthis’ control. The Yemeni people are dying without shelter and food.Rae StreetLittleborough, Greater Manchester  As Nesrine Malik notes, there are wars elsewhere than in Ukraine. An elderly Christian lady I met recently said with some bitterness that she would not be responding to the various calls for prayers for Ukraine. Why? Despite years of conflict and thousands of deaths in her country, she has never heard British church leaders pray for peace there. She is a Nigerian refugee and had clearly got the message – if it is only black people massacring each other a safe distance away, let them get on with it.Rev Richard BradshawSowerby, North Yorkshire  Moustafa Bayoumi’s timely article on the unconscious racism all too evident in some coverage of the war in Ukraine makes uncomfortable reading (They are ‘civilised’ and ‘look like us’: the racist coverage of Ukraine, 2 March), but let us not forget that for more than 100 years, Europe has been scarred by wars on a scale previously unimaginable in which racial hatred played a large part. Though often overlooked, this undeniable aspect is emphasised by the title of Mark Mazower’s fine book, Dark Continent: Europe’s Twentieth Century (1998), in which it is traced from the end of the first world war to the wars following on from the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.Emeritus professor James Alan DownieGoldsmiths, University of London  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/5/2022,"I wish Fergus Butler-Gallie well in his trade union activity with Anglican priests (Bullying, evictions, contract disputes: no wonder we priests need a trade union, 27 February). The mainstream churches have long been ambivalent in their understanding of employment. During 38 years as a full-time Methodist minister, I was intrigued by the way in which we paid both Paye and a self-employed national insurance contribution. This was felt by some as a bit of an unfair imposition at the time, but I have discovered that the resultant state pension is pretty good in retirement. From the 1980s onwards, there were Methodist ministers who felt that a clergy branch of a trade union was the way forward. My own record is a bit different. As a part-time free church chaplain (1980-86) at a large district general hospital, it felt right for a colleague and myself to join the local branch of the National Union of Public Employees as an act of solidarity with lower-paid workers. The pinnacle of my union career came when two chaplains and a room full of cleaners were ritually ejected by a very large police officer from the occupation of the boardroom on the day when management were set to privatise the jobs of our fellow trade unionists. The photograph in the local paper was probably a contribution to my being told in due course that there was not enough support for the renewal of my appointment in the local Methodist circuit. Sometimes you just have to do what you believe to be right and face the consequences. As a minister, I had a job for life – somewhere – and I moved on to an interesting post in Salford. Millions do not enjoy that sort of security, and trade unions are needed as much as ever, if not more so.Geoff ReidBradford  Rev Fergus Butler-Gallie highlights clergy vulnerability issues very well. Having been ordained for 34 years, I have seen safeguards eroded, and the church has become depressingly over-bureaucratic and centralised. Fear of the future has played its part too, as we struggle financially and try to maintain a presence. Bishops have become CEOs. Archdeacons think they are bishops. Parish clergy numbers decline. We are a bit like the Royal Navy; plenty of admirals as the fleet shrinks. Too often the church has lost its pastoral heart and the hierarchy have become remote, detached figures.

3/5/2022,"MPs are to get a good pay rise, and some of them will deserve it (MPs to get £2,200 pay rise next month, 1 March). However, the rest of the public sector miss out with lower rises. It is now time for all public sector pay to be related to that of MPs – or even the prime minister. That way, all will get the same rise – whether a nurse, doctor, teacher or refuse collector. In fact, the prime minister’s allowance, and that of MPs, could be linked to the private sector. Running a country is as important as running a major business and should be rewarded accordingly. If the prime minister’s allowance was equal to, say, the median of that paid in the previous calendar year to executive directors of the FTSE 250 companies, then all jobs and professions in the public could have their pay set at an appropriate percentage of the prime minister’s allowance. All would be reviewed for payment from April. Of course, in the unlikely event that company directors cut their pay, all those in the public sector would also have a pay cut.Gerard CavalierSouthampton  It’s reassuring in this time of so much uncertainty that little has changed at the trough in Westminster.

3/5/2022,"Roy Appleyard (Letters, 1 March), who believes the Palace of Westminster should be pulled down and replaced with a modern building, cites the Scottish and Welsh parliaments as exemplars. He has forgotten the financial saga of the building of the Scottish parliament? The Scotsman reported in 2003 that it had achieved possibly the most embarrassing accolade, being ranked as one of the worst building projects in the world for cost overruns. It opened three years late and substantially over budget. Other options before it was commissioned included St Andrew’s House on Calton Hill. It was large enough, but not new enough. Last year the Pritzker prize for architecture was won by the French team Lacaton & Vassal, who say “never demolish”. They show that even the most unprepossessing tower block can be made desirable and environmentally friendly. In this era of galloping climate crisis, I would add “never build, unless absolutely essential”. Every existing building contains vast amounts of embodied energy. Every demolition entails waste, upheaval and yet more energy. So many of the big London estate “regeneration” schemes are exercises in privatisation. The energy involved in creating a new parliament building is immense. What is wrong with the Palace of Westminster plans is that MPs have insisted on continuing the old ways of working, with division lobbies and the rest. Government could be modernised within the parliamentary estate, and the historic building restored merely to stability, not to excess. The roof has already been replaced, under budget. The right scheme could ensure that is the case for the rest of it.

3/5/2022,"“The customers teach me about life. Working teaches me about life. Basically, everything here at the restaurant is life,” says Rama Bani Khalid, a charismatic, curly-haired 12-year-old. Rama is a takeout kid: one of many New Zealand children who work in the country’s innumerable takeaway and fast food joints. There, she mans the phones and till, hustles for tips and tops up the water bottles. “I’m a waiter and I help out a lot,” says Rama, who spends much of her days in her family’s Jordanian restaurant, Petra Shawarma, in Auckland. “I think I know pretty much everyone on the street.” “Sometimes she’ll sit with the customers and gossip with them,” says Bara, her older sister, who started working in the shop when she was younger than Rama is now. New Zealand has one of the world’s highest per capita ratios of takeaway and fast food joints in the world. Family-owned fish and chip shops, kebaberies and Chinese takeouts are embedded in many New Zealanders’ weekly routines and rituals. But the lives of the families who run these small businesses – often first- and second-generation immigrants – can easily remain invisible. “No one really sees behind the scenes,” Bara says – but she and Rama are proud to tell customers their restaurant’s story. “You know, when [people] get that taste, they’re like – OK, there was a lot more sacrifices that were made to be open, or have this dish here,” Bara says. “Work for me at a young age, it was my getaway. And I can kind of see it starting to kick in with Rama – because you can be who you want to be here at Petra, as a waiter or as a cook. No one can judge you, you can just be proud of what your parents have done. And because we help out, we’re like, oh, we made this: I made this, and mum made this, and dad made this.” Film-maker Julie Zhu recently released a four-part documentary series, Takeout Kids, which documents the hidden worlds of families who own the country’s takeout shops, and the lives of the children who work behind New Zealand’s counters. The films draw to surface quiet, often joyful moments, elevating the everyday by gentle observation. Martynique, at Samoa’s Finest in Porirua, sells baked taro and pineapple pies. John, at Westminster Takeaways fish and chip shop, takes down orders and quietly corrects spelling on the menu board. “Immigrant stories are often relegated to the sidelines,” Zhu says. “I was born in China and I came to New Zealand when I was four … I am really interested in the, quote unquote, immigrant experience – not that it’s universal. This was one way of exploring that,” she says. While her own parents did not own a takeaway store, Zhu noticed echoes of common experience with the children she documented. “I grew up with parents who were always working. So I was left home alone before I should have been and had to make my own fun. I was interested in what life was like for kids whose parents had to work a lot, and kids who are kind of growing up seeing their parents working and seeing what that sacrifice might be,” she says. Brooklyn Jiang, 12, helps out in his family’s cafe, Sunburst Coffee Lounge, in Thames, a small town on the coast of the North Island. After-school and weekend time is often spent in the cafe, sometimes fixing gadgets: he’d like to become an engineer. Because the cafe is open seven days a week, he sometimes wishes he had more time to spend with his parents. “It’s a bit hard for me – I can’t hang out with my parents that much. So that is a little bit hard, cause I really want to hang out with them.” For some immigrants to New Zealand, a takeaway shop can introduce a taste of home. For others, it is a means to an end: a grappling hook to give families their first purchase on the slick, icy face of New Zealand employment. The Massey University New Settlers programme study found refugees and immigrants from non-English-speaking countries “faced formidable barriers in gaining employment in New Zealand” – including discrimination on the basis of accent or name, and a lack of regard for overseas experience and training. Many of these businesses may not last beyond the second generation, and often they are not designed to. Brooklyn’s mother, Lim Heng Yuen, came to New Zealand from Cambodia when she was 15 years old. Like many immigrants for whom English is a second language, she says it was a struggle to find jobs when she entered the workforce. Eventually starting a family cafe, where you work for yourselves, felt like the best way forward. “You know, sometimes I feel sad that I am working long hours and I can’t take my children out – and some people say, ‘I feel sorry for your children’… But I love my children. I try my best to get them to have a better life – but I also need to work. When English is your second language, it’s not easy to find a job,” she says. “The only thing that you can do is to find a way to make your own job.” Takeout Kids is available to watch online here",News/World news,The hidden lives of New Zealand’s ‘takeout kids’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/05/the-hidden-lives-of-new-zealands-takeout-kids
3/5/2022,"Manchester United: the Lost Decade. If Amazon Prime wants another blockbuster sports series then start production to document what next season will be 10 years searching in the wilderness for the title. For added depth, perspective and poignancy feature a narrative strand about how the final league derby with Manchester City (Sunday, 4.30pm) before that landmark campaign was entered found United in role reversal with their crosstown rivals: the record 20-times champions have become the club in freefall while City are the slickly run serial trophy winners. United were last champions in May 2013. Ralf Rangnick’s tenure as interim manager will not end in a 21st crown – United are 19 points behind City with 11 matches left – so the drought will stretch into a barely comprehensible 10th season. Since Sir Alex Ferguson’s vintage triumphed, United’s finishing positions are seventh, fourth, fifth, sixth, second, sixth, third and second. Also damning is how none of the sides assembled by David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjær were true contenders. Of the two runners-up finishes, Mourinho’s 2017-18 squad trailed 19 points behind City and last term’s team, under Solskjær, were 12 behind Pep Guardiola’s third champion team. The post-Ferguson era has been a catalogue of sorry mismanagement, the chief culprits being Ed Woodward, the former executive vice-chairman, and the co-owner Joel Glazer for failing four times to hire the right No 1 and overseeing a dysfunctional transfer policy yet to be corrected. If United were bound to be Ferguson-centric after his 26-and-a-half-year reign, Moyes did not possess the vision for empire reconstruction. When Woodward and Glazer sacked him in April 2014, 34 league matches into a six-year deal, a slide had begun that continues eight years on. With no checks and balances, Van Gaal, Moyes’s successor, was allowed a transfer strategy more akin to a crapshoot than a coherent approach. Where, for example, was the due diligence on Ángel Di María that might have illuminated the player’s reservations before a then British record £59.3m was splurged? After signing he penned an open letter to Real Madrid fans outlining how he never wished to leave. As with Morgan Schneiderlin, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Marcos Rojo and other Van Gaal recruits, Di María did not work out. But the Dutchman did claim the 2016 FA Cup – the first trophy since Ferguson left. His reward? To be sacked by Woodward/Glazer the day after. They might argue that finishing sixth meant Van Gaal had to be axed. Others might posit the decision showed an obsession with the bottom line: no Champions League football the following season meant a sizeable dip in revenue. Next was Mourinho, whose last position had ended in the sack by Chelsea. Woodward/Glazer finally signed him after a reluctance the Portuguese’s camp was aware of; not the best start. He proved a past-peak Mourinho, his demand for “respect, respect, respect” in one press conference meltdown encapsulating how his powers had waned and his frustration at being refused the purchase of Harry Maguire in summer 2018. If this showed the club had learned from Van Gaal’s quasi-licence-to-sign, it seemed an odd application of the new strictures above Mourinho: if you employ a temperamental, three-times Premier League winner who insists on being backed what is the point in not backing him? Mourinho did still claim the League Cup and Europa League in 2016-17 (the club’s most recent honours). But by Christmas 2018 Woodward/Glazer had sacked their third manager and would cull a fourth less than three years later when Solskjær’s second-place finish last season was followed by the team flatlining at the start of this. Before then, the Norwegian appeared to be the one post-Ferguson manager who operated a joined-up transfer policy. Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Daniel James and Bruno Fernandes may have been of varying quality but they were seen as the same type of fast, technical footballer. By then Woodward and Glazer had overseen what was billed as a “cultural reboot” where the (not really very) new idea was to acquire players who fitted those already in the squad and for the side to adhere to a “United style” of football that was quick and forward-thinking. But in the last close season Solskjær misfired in the market. In came Cristiano Ronaldo, whose one-paced game made him the definition of an anti-reboot player, and Jadon Sancho, whose £73m fee should have been offered to West Ham for Declan Rice or any other best-in-class midfielder – that area remaining a glaring weakness. Wrong buys have been particularly costly. In 2013-14 Moyes’s outlay was £69.42m. In 2014-15 Van Gaal’s ran to £175.82m and the next season it was £140.4m. Mourinho’s first term cost £166.5m, the next £178.56m. In 2019-20 Solskjær’s bill totalled a staggering £211.32m and 2020-21’s was a (pandemic-induced) £75.42m before last summer’s windows ran to £126m (nothing was spent in January). This adds up to a £1.1bn outlay for a yield of zero titles, three cups and one Champions League quarter-final (under Moyes in 2014). The handling of outgoings also looks errant as the club potentially head for an expensive close season. Paul Pogba is almost certain to leave for free – a £93m loss. Anthony Martial, whose acquisition was up to £57.6m depending on bonuses, also wants to depart; given that he is out of contract in 2024 the hit on any sale will be about £20m. Juan Mata, a £37.1m buy under Moyes, has zero market value – he is 33 and a return of 30 league starts across the past four seasons suggests United were unwise to retain him for a cumulative salary of at least £33m. In 2019 Phil Jones was given a fresh four-year deal of about £5.2m a year despite an already chequered injury record – he has made nine league starts since; another £20.8m that might have been more prudently invested. Donny van de Beek’s £35m acquisition in September 2020 has failed and if the midfielder, now on loan at Everton, departs in the summer United will have to swallow a minimum £10m loss. Jesse Lingard, who will be out of contract in the close season, was convinced to stay last summer yet would have added £15m to the coffers if sold then. These six players represent a minimum £200m loss and when the £43m compensation paid to sack Moyes, Van Gaal, Mourinho and Solskjær is factored in, United are cast as financial spendthrifts despite the Glazers’ reputation as shrewd business people. In this tale of two crosstown clubs, City have become a smoothly tooled machine that purrs from title to title, apposite signing to apposite signing. As United contemplate their lost decade, Joel Glazer and Richard Arnold, Woodward’s successor, have to ensure the executive-level wrong turns have been learned from. And ask whether Mauricio Pochettino or Erik ten Hag, the favourites to be United’s next manager, possess the X-factor of a Ferguson or Guardiola. If the answer is no the lost decade may start to move towards a second.",Sport/Football,A £1.1bn tale of woe: the story of Manchester United’s lost decade,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/04/story-of-manchester-united-lost-decade-premier-league
3/5/2022,"Close Donald Trump ally Roger Stone raged at the former US president in the aftermath of the failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election, according to a report from the Washington Post, telling a friend that Trump was a “disgrace” who would go to prison and adding: “He betrayed everybody.” The Post said it had viewed 20 hours of footage of the political operative that had been shot for a forthcoming documentary. The footage, it said, showed Stone: Meeting and corresponding with members of a far-right militia since indicted for seditious conspiracy over the Capitol riot on January 6. Discussing a plan in which Trump would issue a blanket pardon to co-conspirators in the attempt to overturn the election, Senator Ted Cruz and congressman Jim Jordan among them. Saying Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser, should be “punished” in a way that would leave him “braindead”. Suggesting violence against protesters for racial justice would be possible with the election out of the way. “Once there’s no more election,” Stone reportedly said, “there’s no reason why we can’t mix it up. These people are going to get what they’ve been asking for.” The plan for a blanket pardon was reportedly blocked by Pat Cipollone, Trump’s White House counsel. “Clearly, Cipollone fucked everybody,” the Post quoted Stone as telling a friend, before messaging another: “See you in prison.” Trump had already commuted a three-year sentence handed to Stone for obstructing Congress during the Russia investigation. The footage viewed by the Post was shot by Danish film-makers for a documentary, A Storm Foretold, to be released this year. Stone, who has resisted cooperation with the House January 6 investigation, told the Post “any claim, assertion or implication that I knew about, was involved in or condoned the illegal acts at the Capitol on January 6” was “categorically false”. Stone also said the paper employed “a clever blend of ‘guilt by association’, insinuations, half-truths, anonymous claims, falsehoods and out-of-context trick questions” and said the footage could be “deep fakes”. Now 69, Stone – who was once a “dirty trickster” for Richard Nixon – has been close to Trump since the 1980s. In 2020 he was closely involved with the “Stop the Steal” movement to overturn Joe Biden’s victory, driven by the lie of widespread electoral fraud. On 5 November, two days after election day and two days before Biden’s victory was called, the film-makers captured Stone talking to Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser Trump pardoned for lying to the FBI during the Russia investigation. “Our slogan should be ‘count every legal ballot’,” Stone was quoted as saying. “Much better messaging. More positive.” In the White House briefing room that evening, the Post said, Trump said: “If you count the legal votes, I easily win.” The Post detailed Stone’s activities leading up to 6 January, including staying at the Willard hotel, a “command centre” for Trump associates. Footage, the paper said, showed Stone with members of the Oath Keepers militia now charged with seditious conspiracy. The film-makers also shot Stone as he attempted to broker presidential pardons for money, and as he attempted to secure access to Trump’s rally near the White House on 6 January, but failed. As the Capitol riot began, the Post said, Stone was unavailable for a short period of time. He then told the film-makers: “I think it’s really bad for the movement. It hurts, it doesn’t help. I’m not sure what they thought they were going to achieve.” But he also said: “When you can’t get a fair and honest judicial opinion, when you can’t get a fair, honest and transparent election, when your legislative process is constipated by fear and threat …” The Post said Stone then “slightly misquot[ed] former president John F Kennedy”: “Those who make peaceful progress impossible make violent revolution inevitable.” Stone returned to Florida and worked on his pardon plan. The Post said intended recipients included senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley and representatives Jim Jordan and Matt Gaetz. Spokesmen for Cruz and Jordan denied contacts with Stone. On 20 January 2021, inauguration day, enraged by a pardon on fraud charges for Steve Bannon, a rival for Trump’s attentions, Stone reportedly said Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, was “going to get a beating. He needs to have a beating. And needs to be told, ‘This time we’re just beating you. Next time we’re killing you.’” Urged to say he was joking, the Post said, Stone said: “No, it isn’t joking. Not joking. It’s not a joke.” Stone also said Kushner should be “punished in the most brutal possible way” and would be “braindead when I get finished with him”. Stone then turned to Trump, who he said deserved to be impeached and whose presidency had been the “greatest single mistake in American history”. “A good, long sentence in prison will give him a chance to think about it, because the southern district is coming for him, and he did nothing,” Stone said, referring to prosecutors in New York investigating Trump’s business. Stone also mocked Trump’s apparent plan to run again, saying: “Run again! You’ll get your fucking brains beat in.” He told the film-makers: “Obviously if you use any of that, I’ll murder you.”",News/US news,Roger Stone raged at ‘disgrace’ Trump over failure to overturn election – report,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/04/roger-stone-trump-election-jared-kushner
3/5/2022,"Dockworkers at a Merseyside refinery in Cheshire have refused to unload Russian oil, echoing steps taken by counterparts at a gas terminal in Kent and in the Netherlands, as dissent spread across European ports in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Unite said it had informed the owner of the Stanlow refinery, India’s Essar Group, that its members would “under no circumstances unload any Russian oil regardless of the nationality of the vessel which delivers it”. A ban on Russian vessels introduced by transport secretary, Grant Shapps, this week does not cover cargo. This has allowed several ships to dock despite carrying gas or oil that was ultimately purchased from Kremlin-controlled entities. Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, said: “Essar may believe that it is justifiable to transport Russian oil under a flag of convenience but Unite does not. Unite urges the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, to close this loophole immediately.” The Stanlow refinery, near Liverpool, is a key source of oil in the north-west of England, and is supported by a key trading relationship with Litasco, a fuel trading firm owned by Russia’s second largest oil company, Lukoil. The action at Stanlow came as gas prices hit record highs and dockworkers in Rotterdam said they would also refuse to unload oil and gas tainted by “blood”, hiring lawyers to back their campaign. Russia typically supplies 30-40% of Europe’s gas, mostly via pipelines, but liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments are another significant source. Ten oil tankers are en route to Rotterdam from Russia, with about 40 more Russian ships due to dock at Europe’s biggest port in the coming month, shipping data shows. Dutch dockers said on Friday they would not offload the cargoes and were preparing for a legal backlash from oil companies and shippers. “There is blood on this oil, blood on this coal and blood on the gas,” said Niek Stam, a spokesperson for FNV Havens, the largest Dutch dockworkers’ union. “We are in the process of finding out how we can boycott it without risking an enormous fine in court,” he told the investigative journalism unit Source Material. The Dutch government has taken no action against Russian ships. Stam said he feared being sued by Russian businesspeople or Dutch oil companies who would “bankrupt his union”, if he encouragef dockers to reject Russian cargoes before his government takes action. FNV Havens has consulted lawyers in readiness for that eventuality. The Netherlands receives more ships from Russia each year than any other European country, most of them docking in Rotterdam. If European countries did not act together to block Russian vessels the ships would simply divert to neighbouring countries, Stam said. In the UK, some consignments of Russian oil and gas have still been able to arrive, notably at Foyle Port in Northern Ireland and Tranmere on Merseyside. Dockers at the Isle of Grain terminal in the Thames Estuary refused to handle a consignment of liquefied natural gas bound for Centrica, the owner of British Gas, forcing the tanker carrying LNG to divert. One gas analyst told the Guardian that dockworkers who do not want to handle Russian gas and oil may find it hard to identify cargoes because it can be switched between ships. He pointed to one Russian-managed tanker that arrived in France and would have been barred from the UK under Shapps’ ban. Instead, it pumped its cargo on to another boat that then sailed to Isle of Grain. On Friday, another vessel called the Pluto was still moored at Foyle Port, where one source said port staff were “sickened” after they were informed by the Department for Transport that there was no legal basis for refusing entry. The Seacod, a German-owned tanker carrying Russian oil, was moored in the Mersey on Friday, clearly visible from riverside walkways near the centre of Liverpool. The Guardian has approached Essar for comment.",News/Business,Dockers at Merseyside refinery refuse to unload Russian oil,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/04/dockers-on-merseyside-refuse-to-unload-russian-oil-stanlow-kent-netherlands-ukraine
3/5/2022,"Not since the immediate run-up to the Iraq war in 2003 has there been such a disinformation blitz about the anti-war movement. In the overheated atmosphere today we are accused of apologising for Putin’s brutal invasion and of being “fifth columnists” and “traitors”. In 2003 we were “friends of the Taliban” or “allies of Saddam”. It wasn’t true then and it’s not true now. What is true is that there seems to be a permanent glitch in the matrix of the minds of war enthusiasts that prevents them from understanding that it is possible to oppose the policy of your own government and still oppose the actions of other governments. Our critics want to make it either/or. But it’s not. Unlike many of our detractors, we are consistent in opposing the misery, death, displacement and disruption that affects any country consumed by war. We feel horror and sickness when we see Putin’s invasion, his attacks on civilian populations and the shelling of a nuclear power station. We have welcomed, supported and publicised the actions of anti-war protesters in Russia. We wish our critics were as consistent, but we wait without expectation for the praise showered on anti-war protesters to come our way. We want to welcome the refugees queueing at the Polish borders and think that our government should do much more to let them into one of the richest countries in the world. And again we hope our critics will be as welcoming to refugees fleeing western wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen and Libya. The hypocrisies of the war supporters are only possible if we forget the context and history of modern wars. Ukraine did not come out of a clear blue sky. We cannot accept a narrative that ignores context and history and simply puts this invasion down to Putin’s designation as the latest “new Hitler” or to his mental state. To wilfully ignore the past, including the recent past, is a disservice to all those who want to end this war. The roots of this conflict lie in what has happened since the end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Warsaw Pact was dissolved, whereas its western opposite, Nato, was not. Despite assurances to the contrary, Nato expanded ever closer towards the Russian border, incorporating 14 new member states, mainly in eastern Europe. It has also expanded into “out of area operations”, including central involvement in Afghanistan and Libya. It now plans further expansion into the Indo-Pacific as part of an increased military presence against China. It is not repeating Kremlin propaganda to point out these facts. And the anti-war movement is far from alone in doing this. George Kennan, the doyen of US foreign policy, has said the same. So did William Burns in 2008. He is now head of the CIA. This is not the first war in Europe since 1945. That was in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, culminating with the Nato bombing of Serbia in 1999. This marked a key turning point in relations with Russia. The next Nato operation was Afghanistan in 2001, initially supported by Russia, as was the bombing of Libya in 2011. These, plus the war in Iraq in 2003, have shaped the present. The features now so widely and correctly condemned in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – from cluster bombs to targeting of civilians to besieging cities – have all been part of western wars, but with very little comment or opposition from the British political class. There was no referral to the international criminal court for the US following its use of depleted uranium in the Iraqi city of Falluja; no sanctions when Trump ordered the dropping the “mother of all bombs” on Afghanistan; no outcry at Britain’s continuing support for Saudi Arabia’s brutal bombing of Yemen. The anti-war movement has a better record of consistency in opposing wars than those who applaud and justify our own government’s wars while decrying the same behaviour by Putin. If the first casualty of war is truth, then the second must be the increasingly intolerant, repressive and anti-Russian sentiments across sections of British society. Keir Starmer’s threat to remove the whip from 11 MPs if they criticised Nato is an astonishing piece of thought policing, and something that even Tony Blair never attempted to do over Afghanistan or Iraq. Are we seriously saying that there can be no criticism of our government’s foreign policy or of its dreadful record of wars over the past 20 years, culminating in the defeat last year in Afghanistan? In some ways even more chilling are the reports of Russian films being removed from festivals, of Russian cats being banned from shows, and of the proposed removal of the statue in Manchester of Friedrich Engels (a German), who always opposed Russia as a Tsarist autocracy and whose political beliefs are roundly denounced by Putin. Talk of no-fly zones has so far been rejected, but we should be aware that any such move would be a declaration of war on Russia by Nato, with terrible consequences. I have no problem with condemning imperialism of any sort. I regard Russia as an imperialist power, although considerably lesser economically and militarily than its opponents. The system of imperialism leads to economic rivalry, which turns into military competition. We have seen a huge increase in military spending throughout the world in the past decades. This war is leading to calls for even more: Germany announced this week it will double its spending, and there is a growing militarisation across Europe. The attacks on the anti-war movement will continue. We will continue to campaign against this war in Ukraine – but we will take no lessons from the warmongers on any side.

3/5/2022,"Russian elites could have their property seized and handed over to Ukrainian refugees, the deputy prime minister has suggested. Dominic Raab made the remarks as he defended the UK’s response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Asked whether Britain could capture property assets owned by Russian oligarchs, he told LBC: “If we’ve got the evidence and the legal basis, then we’ll do it.” Pressed on whether he would back using those properties to house Ukrainian refugees – a move called for by the Liberal Democrats and reportedly argued for in government by the housing secretary, Michael Gove – Raab replied: “Yes, absolutely. “We are looking at everything in the round, it is a team effort across government, from the foreign and defence secretary through to Michael Gove and, of course, the prime minister is driving this very hard.” The UK’s strategy appears to be based on trying to cause the whole Russian economy pain, which is why it has focused more on banking, state institutions and companies than individuals so far. However, government sources have repeatedly said they are planning to target more oligarchs and politically connected people in “weeks and months”. Also on the list will be all members of the Russian parliament from both houses, and members of the Russian security council who voted for the invasion. Two more oligarchs, Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov, faced sanctions on Thursday and their assets in the UK have been frozen. However, the Foreign Office refused to confirm whether any assets belonging to Vladimir Putin himself have been identified and frozen after sanctions against him last week. The Foreign Office is understood to be confident that Shuvalov owns flats in Westminster worth an estimated £11m, and that Usmanov owns a £48m mansion in Hampstead and a Tudor manor in Surrey, though a spokesperson for Usmanov on Wednesday denied he was the owner. It was unclear which property or properties the spokesperson was referring to, but it raises the prospect Usmanov may have tried to offload property or is contesting the asset freeze. Sources said individuals who had faced sanctions would no longer be allowed to repair their property without a licence, or rent or sell it. The UK government has faced criticism for being too slow in its approach to implementing sanctions against Russian figures and linked assets. The Labour party chair, Anneliese Dodds, said the UK had to “stop dragging” its feet in clamping down on funds that have come from figures linked to Putin. Support local charities There are several Ukrainian charities working on the ground. Sunflower of Peace is a charity that helps paramedics and doctors, and has been fundraising for supplies, which includes first aid medical tactical backpacks. United Help Ukraine focuses on providing medical supplies and humanitarian aid, and raising awareness of the conflict. Voices of Children aims to help children affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, providing support through art therapy, psychologists, video storytelling and a number of other methods. The British Red Cross has launched an emergency appeal to help Ukraine. The charity will be updating its webpage with news on the work its team is doing, and how support will be used to help people. Support local journalism English-language news outlets based in the country, such as Kyiv Independent and the New Voice of Ukraine, are covering developments on the ground as the conflict unfolds, using local journalists. The Kyiv Independent says it was created by journalists in order to defend editorial independence. This site on Twitter covers many local journalists in Ukraine.

She told Sky News: “I certainly would say that we have been far too soft, especially over the last 10 years, on those funds that have come from Putin-linked oligarchs and business people.” She added: “We see, even with the new measures that finally have been extracted from the government now that they say they will announce on Monday, an 18-month window before they will come into action – that’s just not good enough. “We need immediate action now. We can put those registers of foreign-owned property into place in 28 days, we believe we could get those running and force that transparency.” Raab, however, said the UK was “at the vanguard” of imposing sanctions on Kremlin-linked money. Asked why the EU had imposed sanctions on more individual Russian elites than Britain had, he said on BBC Breakfast it was a “false distinction”, adding: “The question is not whether it is individuals or companies – it is where the money is flowing.” Separately, he said: “There has been a running commentary that the UK has somehow been slow – we’ve not been slow. We’ve been at the vanguard of taking action and, of course, what is really important is we act in concert with our allies, European, American and other Nato allies.”",News/World news,"Property of Russian elites could be handed to Ukrainian refugees, says Raab",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/property-of-russian-elites-could-be-handed-to-ukrainian-refugees-says-raab

3/5/2022,"In just a few days, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has upended decades of international relations thinking and practices. Nothing will be the same as before. Even the 5,000-word statement on ‘international relations in a new era’ issued by China and Russia just a month ago in Beijing - to make the world safe for autocracy - has been overtaken by events. In this ugly Russian quagmire, China’s role and behaviour merit close attention, not least as we wonder whether Ukraine today may be Taiwan tomorrow. China and Russia have been getting closer for some time. The binds are visible in bilateral trade, which has more than doubled since 2015 to almost $150bn. China is Russia’s biggest trade partner. While Russia is almost a rounding error in China’s global exports, the two countries collaborate in military exercises, regional security arrangements and technology trade. These binds go some way to counter other differences and long-standing sources of mistrust, for example over Russian Far East and central Asia. Yet, the biggest bind of all is geopolitics. Headed by control-obsessed dictators pledged to remain in power and protect their elites, they have both been gifted political opportunities created by, for example, the long tail of the 2008 ‘western’ financial crisis, Brexit and European political weakness, Donald Trump, and Covid management issues in many democracies. They are joined at the hip in their pursuit of an anti-US and anti-western agenda in which they want to reshape the world order, including by force. Putin’s awkward and brutal invasion of Ukraine doesn’t change any of this but it has changed the Sino-Russian relationship consummated at the Olympics on 4 February, and caused China consternation. Considerable speculation focuses on what Xi Jinping knew. It is hard to believe Xi was not forewarned about something, especially as the US tried to brief him with intelligence only to be rebuffed. We also know Russian troops were subsequently moved from the Far East to Ukraine, and China is thought to have bought back previously released oil into its Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Whatever the reality, China is deemed to have been complicit, at least by supporting Russia and backing it since, leaving it uncomfortably on a spiky fence. Xi won’t back away from Putin because to do so would lead to much embarrassment and humiliation at home - a non-starter, especially in this key year ending with the 20th Party Congress. Yet, standing by Putin, and supporting overtly the weak Russian economy associates China firmly with a pariah state and erodes such trust and credibility in China’s statecraft. China’s list of friends globally isn’t that big or impressive anyway. With strong leverage over Russia now, China can help its beleaguered neighbour, which, with its main banks excluded from the global financial system, its foreign exchange reserves frozen, and firms and persons subject to sanctions and asset freezes, has become a vassal state of China. It can buy much more energy and resources, and subject to ubiquitous sanctions laws, make loans, provide funds via currency swap agreements, trade in yuan, and supply semiconductors and other technology goods. Yet, China will have to be careful to calibrate an image which isn’t overly accommodating, and reminds the world both that it can be an agent for important public goods, such as peace-broking in Ukraine, and that it wants the global system to remain relatively open. Remember that, unlike Russia, China’s ambitions depend on a relatively open world economy in trade and technology, and on global and regional institutions which it would like to re-shape to suit its own interests. This is all at risk now if democracy supporting and other nations choose to push a Russia-supporting China further away - and or if China doubles down to insulate itself. China was certainly shocked how the EU, in particular, and the US came together purposefully and forcefully to freeze Russia out of the system. China’s continuing dependency on key western technologies and markets remains, despite acts of decoupling and self-reliance. It would certainly not want to risk being in the cross-hairs of a Russia-type financial war, over, for example Taiwan. Beijing regards Taiwan as an inalienable part of China, and so its recently offered support for the territorial integrity of Ukraine and others should not be taken at face value. China has never ruled out taking Taiwan by force, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, if anything, makes comparable Chinese action over Taiwan less, rather than more, likely. From a rational standpoint at least, China will surely note that in war, best laid plans do go awry, resistance by people desperate for their country is a deserving cliché, and the US Pacific fleet and other Quad forces are close. It will be strongly aware, moreover, that ‘western’ and other global economic and financial pushback is anything but a spent force and potentially highly effective. If Russia as basically a commodity producer is so sensitive to financial war, China as an economic colossus with strong dependencies is at even bigger risk. Note also that Japan has revived a debate about taking US nuclear weapons, and ending the policy of ambiguity over Taiwan’s political status. China’s new Russia relationship remains but it has changed radically. It now has high leverage over Russia but, by close association, little to gain globally and much to lose. Xi Jinping has no good options, and difficult choices to make as he tries to walk the line between supporting Russia and rebuilding friendly relations with the west. We need to remain on guard against thinking China’s totalitarian leader will be different from what Russia’s always was.

3/5/2022,"Emma Hayes is confident her highly successful Chelsea women’s team will remain an important and properly funded part of the club once new owners move into Stamford Bridge. Roman Abramovich’s decision to sell Chelsea has prompted concern that future support could be withdrawn from Hayes’s squad but the manager does not share such worries. “We’re fully embedded into this football club,” said Hayes as she prepared for Saturday’s League Cup final against Manchester City at AFC Wimbledon’s Plough Lane ground. “I know any future owners are going to want success for the club and the women’s team are part of that. “You hear about underfunded women’s teams but there’s no chance of that happening here or things going backwards. This club is invested in its women’s team and I expect that to remain long and strong into the future. “I have no anxieties or worries about our status. I know we’re embedded internally. I know the relationships we have across the club; all departments are working on the same page and that won’t change.” Nonetheless Hayes acknowledged she had experienced more straightforward weeks. “It’s been a long week for people at Chelsea, it’s been difficult, of course it has; I can’t deny that,” she said. “But there are worse things going on in the world now. Nothing’s more difficult than the horrendous situation Ukraine’s going through. Yes, there’s going to be some change and the position we’re in is a challenge but we’re not afraid of it.” Hayes applauds stellar internal club communications that have helped her squad feel fully informed. Along with Thomas Tuchel’s men, the women’s squad have been briefed by Petr Cech, Chelsea’s technical and performance adviser. “Our level of communication’s first class,” said Hayes. “Chelsea people are amazing people in all sections and nothing’s changed in that respect. While we acknowledge the club is to be sold, it will always be a significant force in the game. While we’ll have a new owner, the culture whereby we all look after each other will remain. I think we’ll continue to be hugely successful. “Of course uncertainty creates conversation and it was important we had a briefing this morning. It reminded the players of our strength and togetherness. Chelsea will remain a strong force because of the people involved here, which is part of the reason why we’ve been successful Footballers know things don’t remain the same. Having that ability to acknowledge change and adapt and evolve to it makes top-class players what they are.”",Sport/Football,Emma Hayes confident future Chelsea owners will support women’s team,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/04/emma-hayes-confident-future-chelsea-owners-will-support-womens-team
3/5/2022,"Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, has pledged to spend nearly £1bn to provide free residential care for all elderly people and free home care in a bid to address Labour’s slump in support. Sarwar said Scottish Labour planned to expand the ethos of the NHS, which provides free care regardless of income, to the social care service. He said totally integrating social and health care provision was an essential prerequisite for NHS reform. “We can’t rebuild our NHS without a functioning and strong care service. That is the key to renewing our NHS for the future,” he told Scottish Labour’s spring conference in Glasgow, in his first conference speech as leader. “Care needs are intrinsically linked with health needs, so it is time we started treating health and care like one system.” The party would abolish rules which require over-65s who are better off to use their own savings and equity in their homes to fund residential care, at a cost of £412m, and provide fuller free care for those at home, for another £519m. In another proposal designed to outbid and outflank the Scottish National party among Labour’s target voters, Sarwar committed his party to introducing a £15 an hour basic wage for care workers, after first raising it to £12. Those policies, he said, would be funded from the extra money for health and social care from the UK Treasury, expected to reach £1.8m in the next financial year and funded by Rishi Sunak’s decision to increase national insurance payments to fund the NHS post-Covid. Elected leader 10 weeks before last year’s Holyrood elections, where Labour clung on to 22 seats, again coming third behind the Conservatives, Sarwar faces another stern test at May’s council elections. In 2017, Labour also came third, losing 133 seats and control of Glasgow, ending decades of Labour domination of the city. Sarwar hopes Labour’s surge in popularity at UK level under Keir Starmer may help revive Scottish Labour’s popularity. But with the SNP under Nicola Sturgeon still buoyant in the polls, he remains cautious about its chances. As part of his efforts to update the party’s image, Scottish Labour unveiled a new thistle logo earlier this week, replacing the party’s red rose logo first introduced at UK level by Peter Mandelson in the 1980s. Sarwar confirmed on Friday he intends pulling Labour back towards the centre-ground; party officials disclosed on Wednesday Scottish Labour had pulled in nearly £1m in donations since he became leader, eclipsing the £250 [sic/cor 250] donated in 2020 under his predecessor.",News/UK news,Scottish Labour leader pledges nearly £1bn to provide free care for older people,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/04/scottish-labour-leader-pledges-nearly-1bn-to-provide-free-care-for-older-people
