 More from the Daily Dot on how the incident unfolded: User @blackmagicsmg asks a so-called “Karen” who is watching him in a grocery story why she is mad at him. “You don’t see me paying for my stuff?” he says while eating gummy worms and using the self-checkout machine. “Who made you security? Out here, confronting us?” the TikToker, who is Black, asks the woman, who is white. The woman pulls out her wallet and says “that’s who made me security” and shows him an ID card with her photo. It’s unclear what the card is for. The TikToker then offers her a gummy worm (she declines) and shows her his receipt. In the caption of the video, @blackmagicsmg referred to the woman as a “Karen” and said showing her ID was a “check mate.” The comment section had a ball and was filled with laughing emojis. “She showed her AARP card,” one user wrote. “It’s a bus card,” wrote another. Another user added, “Pulled the Karen card out.” While some found the woman’s actions amusing, others used it to criticize her for thinking the man was stealing. One user commented, “It isn’t stealing unless you walk out of the store. He even paid for the lollies in the end and she is there talking the talk.” From the Daily Dot: According to FindingLaw, an outlet that provides legal expertise, eating food in a grocery store is not shoplifting. “You need to have committed the act of taking the item and have the intention of evading the checkout counter in order to be found guilty of shoplifting, according to the law,” states FindingLaw. The outlet also clarifies that “shopkeepers generally have discretion” when detaining a shopper who they suspect to be shoplifting. In addition, the package of gummy worms that @blackmagicsmg bought had a fixed price, unlike items like produce that are priced by weight.",U.S./The Root,‘Karen’ Flashes ID at Black Man on TikTok Who Ate Gummy Worms Before Paying for Them,https://news.yahoo.com/karen-flashes-id-black-man-181610995.html
1/22/2022,"By Jarrett Renshaw (Reuters) - Several U.S. House members from President Joe Biden's Democratic Party are threatening to block a renewed push for his Build Back Better spending bill if it does not include the expansion of a federal deduction for taxes paid to states and local entities. Expanding the deduction, known as SALT for State and Local Taxes, has been a demand of lawmakers in higher-tax states such as California, New Jersey and New York, especially in suburbs where Democrats seek to retain control in Nov. 8 elections. ""We support the president’s agenda, and if there are any efforts that include a change in the tax code, then a SALT fix must be part of it. No SALT, no deal,"" members Tom Suozzi of New York and Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer, both of New Jersey, said in a joint statement late on Thursday. The SALT deduction, part of the U.S. income tax code from its inception more than a century ago, was restricted to $10,000 in a 2017 Republican tax law. The cap disproportionately affects homeowners in higher home-value states that lean toward the Democratic Party, like New Jersey, where the average homeowner pays roughly $9,000 in local property taxes. Asked about the House lawmakers' demand, a Biden White House official said: ""We are in touch with a wide range of lawmakers regarding the president’s economic growth plan for the middle class, and weighed in about SALT late last year, but we won’t negotiate in public."" The ""SALT caucus"" has more than 30 members in the House of Representatives who want to expand the deduction, including some Republicans, congressional aides say. Their demand adds to the challenges the White House faces as it tries to salvage https://www.reuters.com/world/us/how-white-house-hopes-save-bidens-spending-bill-2022-01-18 some of Biden's $1.7 trillion spending package and push it through with slim congressional majorities. As the White House tries to downsize that bill, it may need to jettison hundreds of billions of dollars in social programs, but preserve SALT, a tax deduction that some in the party call a giveaway to the rich. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi can only afford three defections because Democrats narrowly control a majority in the 435-member House. The House passed a version of Biden’s social-spending bill that increased the cap to $80,000, despite objections from some progressives that it largely benefits higher-income households. The bill died in the 100-member Senate for lack of majority Democratic support.

1/22/2022,"(Reuters) -More than 8,000 workers at nearly 80 Kroger Co-owned King Soopers stores called off their strike on Friday after reaching a tentative deal with the U.S. retail giant, the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7 union said. The details of the contract would be made public to the union members after a voting by workers beginning Monday, the union said. ""You have seven days to return to work. Contact your store manager to be placed on the schedule,"" the union told https://bit.ly/33Ep6iP the workers on Twitter. The workers went on a strike on Jan. 12 after rejecting at least two offers from the grocery chain. The union had rejected a $170 million offer made last week by Kroger, which termed it as the ""last, best and final offer"". The offer proposed wage increases of up to $4.50 per hour depending on job classification and tenure, with the starting rate of pay increased to $16 per hour. The union, however, sought raises of at least $6 per hour for everyone. Rising COVID-19 infections and inflation have pushed U.S. workers to demand better working conditions and higher pay, with employees at Deere & Co and Kellogg Co's cereal plants recently securing better deals after weeks of strike. The latest deal comes after a lot of difficult negotiation, in which Kroger accused the union of refusing to bargain in good faith, while the union alleged a few King Soopers representatives displayed ""unprofessional"" and ""outrageous"" behavior. A U.S. court earlier this week had granted King Soopers a temporary restraining order against its striking workers, prohibiting picketing in groups of over 10 people, interfering with anyone within 20 feet of the individual or standing in front of store entrances or vehicles.
