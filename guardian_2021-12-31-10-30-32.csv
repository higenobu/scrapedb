12/31/2021,"The Colorado governor has intervened to reduce the 110-year sentence handed down to a trucker for his role in a fatal 2019 collision after widespread outcry and calls for leniency. Jared Polis announced Thursday he would commute the sentence for Rogel Aguilera-Mederos, reducing his sentence from 110 years to 10 years. Under the new sentence, the 26-year-old would be eligible for parole in five years.  “I am writing to inform you that I am granting your application for a commutation,” Polis wrote. “I believe you deserve clemency for several reasons. You were sentenced to 110 years in prison, effectively more than a life sentence, for a tragic but unintentional act.” Polis said that the sentence was “simply not commensurate” with Aguilera-Mederos’ “actions, nor with penalties handed down to others for similar crimes”. In October, a jury convicted Aguilera-Mederos of vehicular homicide and other charges related to a deadly collision that occurred while he was hauling lumber in the Rocky Mountain foothills. He has said that the brakes on his semi-trailer failed as he was descending a steep section of the highway, leading to four deaths and a multi-vehicle pileup. The lengthy sentence, which the judge said he was obligated to give Aguilera-Mederos due to minimum sentencing laws in the state, was widely condemned and fueled criticism of the US justice system. More than 5 million people signed a petition calling for Polis to grant clemency to Aguilera-Mederos or commute his sentence, an effort truckers, civil rights groups and celebrities such as Kim Kardashian voiced support for. “It is a stark miscarriage of justice,” said Domingo Garcia, the president of the League of United Latin American Citizens (Lulac), of the sentence. Lulac sent a letter to Polis on behalf of Aguilera-Mederos, a Cuban immigrant, requesting a pardon or a reduction of his sentence, and Garcia traveled to Colorado to meet with the governor. Kardashian, a criminal justice reform advocate, was among those who praised the governor’s decision. “This case was a clear example of why mandatory minimums don’t work and need to be abolished. I’m grateful to Governor Polis for his empathy and leadership on this case,” Kardashian said on Twitter. The decision was among several end-of-the-year commutations and pardons issued by Polis. The governor’s announcement comes after a judge scheduled a hearing next month to reconsider the sentence at the request of the district attorney, who had planned to ask that it be reduced to 20 to 30 years. The ACLU of Colorado has expressed hope that the case might prompt reform of mandatory minimum sentencing laws in the state. “The extraordinary nature of this particular case has prompted comments from some lawmakers that they may be interested in doing that,” said Mark Silverstein, the legal director of the ACLU of Colorado. “Sometimes unfortunately it takes an extraordinary case like this that put something that ought to be on the legislative agenda to the top of the legislative agenda.” The Associated Press contributed to this report",News/US news,Colorado trucker’s 110-year sentence reduced to 10 years after outcry,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/30/colorado-trucker-given-110-years-has-sentenced-reduced-after-outcry
12/31/2021,"Josh Frydenberg has spoken to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chair Rod Sims about concerns some suppliers are charging sky-high prices for Covid-19 rapid antigen tests. However, ACCC staff, including Sims, are currently on holiday and do not return to work until Tuesday. The regulator is also limited in action it can take because it does not have the power to set prices and the treasurer has decided not to order it to conduct a formal inquiry.  It comes amid reports of soaring prices for RATs, which Scott Morrison this week said should be used by people concerned about whether they had Covid in order to take pressure off the public testing system, which delivers the more reliable but much slower polymerase chain reaction tests. There are reports overwhelmed pathology labs are taking as long as six days to return PCR results. On Thursday, the prime minister ruled out making RATs free to all, despite pledges by the New South Wales and Victorian governments to hand them out. Morrison said this was a result of “concerns” raised by industry that they would be undercut by free tests, but industry groups denied lobbying for the change. “The treasurer has spoken to the ACCC chair and he is aware of the government’s concerns regarding rapid antigen test pricing,” a spokesperson for Frydenberg said. Frydenberg has not instructed Sims to use his power to hold a formal inquiry into RAT prices. These inquiries have in the past looked at medium and long-term pricing problems and take “months or in some cases, years” to run, the spokesperson said. Morrison on Wednesday said Frydenberg would pursue the issue with the ACCC and on Thursday the health minister, Greg Hunt, said the government would take “strong, clear, swift action” if it uncovered evidence of price gouging. The ACCC does not have the power to fix prices and can only take legal action over high prices if suppliers are colluding, misleading the public or prices are so high as to be unconscionable. Allan Fels, a former ACCC chair, said that the regulator could “expose and shame” price gougers. “They can do what are called market studies, where they identify high prices and their cause, and then they recommend things to the government,” he said. “The main powers of the ACCC are probably exposure or recommending direct government action.” The president of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, Trent Twomey, said chemists were not responsible for soaring RAT prices. “So I was making $4 on a test three weeks ago, and I’m still making $4 on a test even though they’ve gone up $10 to the consumer,” he said. “That’s because my cost price has gone up $10.” An ACCC spokesperson said the regulator would “investigate any evidence of price collusion and take appropriate action”. “The ACCC can publicly call out any suppliers which seem to be exploiting the shortage of rapid antigen tests,” the spokesperson said. “Under the Competition and Consumer Act excessive pricing may, in certain circumstances, constitute unconscionable conduct. Any such case would need to be ultimately decided by a court.”",News/World news,Frydenberg raises rapid antigen test pricing concerns with ACCC but doesn’t order formal inquiry,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/frydenberg-raises-rat-pricing-concerns-with-competition-watchdog-but-doesnt-order-formal-inquiry
12/31/2021,"For Krisinda Merhi, recovering from Covid while isolating in her bedroom felt like “exhausting nothingness”. “You’re tired from doing nothing, because you both can’t and don’t have the energy to,” she says.  The 25-year-old Sydneysider contracted Covid after a trip to Melbourne in November. It started with “slight congestion and a persistent cough”. After receiving a positive PCR result, Merhi instantly relocated to her bedroom, where she stayed isolated for a week. Luckily, her family of five, who isolated inside the home as close contacts, all remained negative. As daily Covid numbers surpass 21,000 in New South Wales, and “worst case” Covid modelling suggests 200,000 cases a day nationwide by late January, Prof Jayashra Kulkarni says isolation inside the home as either a Covid-positive person or close contact is becoming “a common experience now”. Kulkarni is a professor of psychiatry from Monash University, and has isolated in her home as a close contact of a Covid-positive family member. She says “it is helpful to know you are not alone”. “Once a family member is detected to be positive, the immediate response is to be anxious,” she says. But Kulkarni reminds us that “human beings are designed to cope with crises”. Here’s what to do if you test positive and need to isolate. Once you receive a positive diagnosis, positive cases should “immediately isolate yourself at your home, or other accommodation”, according to Queensland Health. “Isolate means you need to stay away from other people as much as possible so you don’t give the virus to someone else. “People living in your house can quarantine at home in a separate area to you. It is still important that you isolate as much as possible from these people so that you don’t give them Covid-19 if they haven’t already caught it,” the advice states. If you cannot safely isolate in your home, public health departments in all states and territories offer special health accommodation in some circumstances. Health authorities advise Covid-positive cases to use a separate bathroom if available, or clean a shared bathroom after each use. Wearing a mask inside your home is also important, especially when entering a room you are sharing with others, according to NSW Health. Ventilating common spaces, such as by opening windows, can also reduce the risk of transmission. On 30 December, national cabinet agreed to new isolation rules for positive Covid-19 cases. Under the new arrangement, a confirmed case must isolate for seven days from the date their infection was confirmed with a test. On day six, they need to return a negative result on a rapid antigen test before they can leave isolation. Public health advice stresses the need to organise for your food and medication supplies to be delivered to you without contact, whether that be from a friend, family member or delivery service. The government recommends widely available painkillers for treating mild symptoms, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. Kulkarni’s shopping list for a week of Covid isolation inside the home includes disposable gloves and surgical masks. She recalls “feeling really exhausted, and not knowing why you’re exhausted”. “So take hot showers, drink lots of tea, and get lots of rest.” Dr Jenny H Martin, a practising physician and clinical pharmacologist of the University of Newcastle, says “staying well hydrated” is helpful to manage symptoms and discomfort. “People find it difficult to drink water, so Hydralyte is helpful.” Kulkarni says organising the “bits and pieces” of receiving grocery deliveries, or care-packages dropped off by friends, is another consideration. Care guidelines are changing as states and territories respond to the Omicron outbreak, but public health advice is fairly consistent. According to Queensland Health, the general rule is that people who are well or have mild symptoms should stay at home for their illness. “Only call Triple Zero (000) or go to an emergency department if you have severe symptoms,” the authority recommends. In a person with underlying, compromising health conditions, symptoms may be more severe. According to the federal government’s healthdirect website, these are the more severe symptoms you should watch for, that indicate you need to go to the hospital: your oxygen level is 92% or less when you test using the pulse oximeter, even if you feel okay worsening shortness of breath or difficulty breathing blue lips or face pain or pressure in the chest cold and clammy, or pale and mottled, skin fainting or collapse being more confused becoming difficult to wake up little or no urine (wee) output – less urine than usual, even though you have been drinking lots of fluid coughing up blood Kulkarni also suggests close contacts who may share the home with a Covid-positive person “keep an eye on transmission” with rapid antigen tests “for peace of mind”. “A person in isolation can feel totally cut off,” Kulkarni says. “The cleanliness factor gets hyped up, and it needs to be. But looking after mental health is important.” She says keeping up communication while in isolation is “really critical”. To feel connected to people while in isolation, Merhi video called with friends and watched movies over the phone with her partner. She says she was “lucky” to have a balcony. “It made it a lot easier to self-isolate. I could actually get fresh air. It was easier on my sanity.” Martin suggests making a list of friends and family to get in touch with, and “working through that list of people each day”. “Some people do yoga, others make at-home gyms with milk bottles filled with water,” she says. “The isolation seems like the hardest thing – just sitting in your room, counting down the hours. “So it doesn’t really matter, you just have to be engaging in something.” After the infectious period has ended, “do not disturb the room or bathroom for a day”, Martin says. “Let it settle. Then wear a mask and gloves, and clean all surfaces with disinfectant.” Kulkarni says that, amid a time of “consideration and changes”, it is important to keep abreast of health rules in your state. “We are in some ways in a middle ground,” she says. “Omicron appears to be a milder illness, particularly in those vaccinated. That is encouraging.” At the same time, however, people remain concerned. “Particularly when you see stories from overseas of long Covid, and events need to be cancelled.” Critical to balancing this, she says, is getting “focused and practical” about a Covid positive result, and being prepared for isolation.",News/Australia news,The Covid isolation guide: how to prepare for a positive result,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/31/the-covid-isolation-guide-how-to-prepare-for-a-positive-result
12/31/2021,"A sizzling heatwave across southern Australia will close out 2021, a year marked by severe storms and above-average rainfall that leaves large areas of the east exposed to flooding in the new year. After a mild start to summer, the mercury in Melbourne is forecast to climb to 38C on New Year’s Eve after topping 34C on Thursday. The first day of 2022 will be similarly hot, with the Bureau of Meteorology tipping 37C for the Victorian capital. Most other capitals will nudge 30C, or be close to it.  Adelaide is the other hot state capital, with 39C predicted for the final day of 2021 after 37.6C on Thursday and similar warmth forecast for Friday. The heatwave, which crested in Perth over Christmas, is the first extended hot spell for much of the country this summer. Perth metro just recorded 4 days in a row over 40 CSat 42.8CSun 43.5CMon 41.0CTues 40.7C (so far)This is the first time in December this has occurred and 3rd time everPrevious times were Feb 2016 and Feb 1933📷 T. Smith, South Cottesloe https://t.co/qLf9e7uf0E pic.twitter.com/mgE4JTlTR7 Many Australians, though, will remember 2021 – to the extent they ventured far from their locked-down or Covid-19 constrained homes – as one in which they needed to keep an umbrella handy. Coastal NSW, including Sydney, was pelted by multiple days of heavy rain in March. The week ending 24 March was the region’s wettest week in Bureau data going back to 1900. Four-day totals in some areas topped 900mm and the Hawkesbury-Nepean floodplain to Sydney’s north and west lived up its name. Less than three months later, it was Victoria’s turn to endure wild weather, with a complex low pressure system generating heavy rain and damaging winds that left as many as 200,000 people without electricity and toppled countless trees. More than 200mm of rain fell in west Gippsland catchment, resulting in major flooding. Other stormy highlights included a tornado that touched down near Bathurst in central western NSW in September. Major floods also swept down long rivers such as the Lachlan and Namoi, and filled the Menindee Lakes and other inland systems. As 2021 closes, regional NSW dams including Sydney’s are about 94% full, while Melbourne’s reservoirs are at 90% capacity. South-eastern Queensland, though, was one patch of eastern Australia that missed out on a lot of rain, with Brisbane’s Wivenhoe dam still under 50% full. In November, the Bureau declared a La Niña pattern had developed in the Pacific for a second year in row, a weather event that tends to favour above-average rainfall for northern and eastern Australia. As if on cue, Australia posted its wettest November on record, beating the previous November record set in 1973 with countrywide falls 124% above average. “Having two sequential La Niñas has particularly elevated the flood risk this spring and summer,” said Karl Braganza, the Bureau’s national manager of climate services. “When you have a really wet month leading into December, and into the monsoon season, that’s when we start to get worried about flooding from even moderate rainfall.” Meanwhile in the east, flood waters remain in northern NSWhttps://t.co/8pjsT2Hz5o pic.twitter.com/RIBUZUiBU4 The extra rainfall was influenced by other weather patterns, including a negative phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole. Such events typically cause increased convection off north-western Australia, resulting in additional moisture making its way across the continent to the country’s south-east. Good rains during the past two years have increased soil moisture levels, which tend to moderate heatwaves through evaporation. One consequence is that 2021 will have been relatively cool, at least compared with recent years. The background warming from climate change has pushed Australia’s temperatures up about 1.4 C since 1900, reducing the likelihood of cool years – 2020, for instance, was Australia’s fourth-hottest on record. This year, though, will probably fail to break into the top 10 for warmth even with the scorching end to the year, Braganza said. “It doesn’t tend to get as hot during La Niña years but you can have extended runs of hot weather,” he said. Some of that heat will be felt this week. For areas such as western Victoria, which have not shared in the above-average falls, the present heatwave will be enough to nudge bushfire risks higher. “Southern Australia is one of the most fire-prone regions of the world in any year,” Braganza adds. During La Niñas, strengthening equatorial winds result in the Pacific Ocean absorbing more heat from the atmosphere, whereas El Niños cause the ocean to give some of that warmth back. This year will probably be about the fifth or sixth warmest on record globally, climatologists expect. That would make it cooler than 2020 but warmer than any year prior to 2014 thanks to the effect of that warming temperature background. “It’s another really warm La Niña year,” Braganza said. One threat from that heating is that coral bleaching remains a risk for the Great Barrier Reef, as Guardian Australia reported earlier this month. “There’s a heightened risk of thermal stress on the Reef out to February,” he said, with a tropical cyclone the best chance of reducing that threat. The current La Niña is forecast to linger into early next year, raising the prospects for a relatively cool and damp start to 2022 for most of eastern Australia, the bureau predicts. For inland northern NSW and southern Queensland, that forecast points to ongoing flood risks. “The dams are spilling, and there was quite significant [recent] rainfall,” Braganza said. “So they’re going to be on a reasonable flood alert for the rest of summer.” Extensive bushfires near Perth in February and again in recent weeks hint at the ever-present challenge of fires in the Australia landscape. And while eastern states are likely to have a subdued season as far as forest fires go, the added rain over the past two years elevates potential risks in coming summers. “Of course, there’s vegetation growth,” Braganza said. “ And we know things can dry out quite quickly.”",News/Australia news,Year of storms and wild weather: New Year’s Eve heatwave hits after a sodden 2021 for much of Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/31/year-of-storms-and-wild-weather-new-years-eve-heatwave-hits-after-a-sodden-2021-for-much-of-australia

He has branded the four intruders as “cowards”.  While the incident is being investigated by the police, Cancelo’s ability to travel with Pep Guardiola’s squad for Saturday’s match against Arsenal is in doubt. The 27-year-old posted a picture of himself on his personal Instagram account in which he was shown to be cut above the right eye and bruised. In the post, Cancelo said: “Unfortunately today I was assaulted by four cowards who hurt me and tried to hurt my family. “When you show resistance this is what happens.

12/31/2021,"With Omicron surging around Australia, there’s good reason to veg out at home in front of the TV this New Year’s Eve and observe the outside world through this medium we call television. One day in the future, plugged into the metaverse, we’ll be astral projecting between virtual fireworks displays while high-fiving our digitally recreated long-dead ancestors, but for now we are still absorbing entertainment via moving images displayed on flat screens. The humble old teev offers various ways to count down the new year, including fireworks displays, recaps and movies.  The Omicron variant of Covid-19 has caused many fireworks displays to be cancelled around the world, including one in Melbourne that would’ve involved more than 350 drones – which may or may not have become sentient mid-performance and decided to rise up against their human overlords. You never know, maybe we dodged a bullet. Many displays are still going ahead, continuing that great human tradition of creating colour and spectacle by making stuff explode in the sky. The ABC will be broadcasting several of them, including the Sydney fireworks at 9pm AEDT for those who can’t be bothered making it to midnight. ABC’s pre-fireworks shebang kicks off at 8.30pm with The Early Night Show, co-hosted by the charismatic actor Hunter Page-Lochard, who played the titular character in ABC TV’s Cleverman and most recently co-starred in Fires. From 9.15pm, the ABC is broadcasting its NYE2021: Let’s Celebrate! concert at Sydney Opera House, hosted by Charlie Pickering, Zan Rowe and Jeremy Fernandez. Performers include Tina Arena, Missy Higgins, Casey Donovan and Genesis Owusu, taking you up to the countdown to midnight and more fireworks over Sydney harbour. Alternatively, viewers in Victoria can tune into channel Nine to watch City Of Melbourne: New Year’s Eve 2021, which starts at 11pm and is hosted by Catriona Rowntree and Clint Stanaway. I appreciate the “yearly recap” format – it reminds me of high school exam cheat sheets. My wife verbally summarised the appeal of the format when, while watching The Yearly with Charlie Pickering 2021, she said “oh yeah, that’s right!” at least three times. Pickering’s special this year contains several laugh-out-loud moments but, obviously filmed pre-Omicron, already looks dated, with Pickering appearing near the beginning of the show sitting in a fairly crowded (albeit masked-up) studio. Funny moments include a segment called the Real Premiers of Australia, which recaps the argy-bargy exchanged between Australian premiers as if it were a reality TV program. For a more international perspective, Netflix has its very funny Death to 2021 special, a sequel to Death to 2020. For snappier recaps, there’s Jimmy Fallon’s compilation of his “news smash” segments, this six-minute rewind of the year from Vox, and – shorter still – a two-and-a-half minute Reddit-produced video, which is set to an annoying upbeat ditty but, to its credit, begins with vision of geese wearing sombreros. But, I hear you asking – nay, demanding – what about articles listing the very best Australian films and TV shows of the year? Here are a couple I prepared earlier: my lists of the best homegrown productions for both the big and small screen, featuring many hours of quality viewing. The perfect film to watch during NYE is something with a bit of a party vibe, or at least something that isn’t a total downer – so, no Lars von Trier films allowed. On ABC iView there’s Firestarter: The Story Of Bangarra, a terrific documentary (No 4 on my list of the best Australian films of the year) about the history of the amazing Bangarra Dance Theatre, which has been staging sumptuous visual and musical performances for decades. Nine is screening Dirty Dancing at 8:30pm, fondly remembered as one of the pedigree dance-themed flicks of the 80s – the crop top-wearing, leg-flailing domain of Flashdance, Footloose, Fame and (my favourite of the bunch) Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo. For good family fun, NITV is screening Taika Waititi’s 2016 comedy Hunt for the Wilderpeople from 7.30pm. Elsewhere, SBS is showing The Blues Brothers at 9:25pm, The Full Monty is airing on Seven from 11pm and 9Gem is screening Ben-Hur from 8.30pm – with a running time of three-and-a-half hours, it’ll take up a good chunk of the night and get you over the finish line into 2022. Those hankering for a blockbuster spectacle can tee up the handsomely cinematic Godzilla vs Kong, which recently landed on Netflix. And if you haven’t seen the excellent Danish comedy/drama Another Round, check it out on SBS on Demand. . Adelaide Oval might be the most handsome sporting arena in the world and it showcases a sunset like nowhere else in Australia. So before the sky lights up with fireworks, why not check out the Adelaide Strikers against the Sydney Thunder in the Big Bash League and the many cutaways to the multicoloured gloaming?

12/31/2021,"Two fast-moving wildfires driven by strong winds erupted in northern Colorado on Thursday afternoon, forcing thousands of residents to flee their homes. The fires, burning to the north and south of the city of Boulder, were fanned by gusts of up to 110 mph that whipped flames and smoke into a frenzy. Officials said during a Thursday evening news conference that the fires had already blackened 1,600 acres and destroyed hundreds of homes.  The Colorado governor Jared Polis has declared a state of emergency, freeing up disaster emergency funds and providing other resources to aid in the response. During the evening press conference, governor Polis thanked first responders and shared that the National Guard and federal resources were being deployed to aid in the firefight, and would arrive soon. “This fire is not so much a question of resources,” he said. “This fire is a force of nature.” Emergency call lines were inundated throughout the day and evacuation routes were heavily trafficked, said the Boulder county sheriff Joe Pelle during the briefing. “I have never seen anything like it,” he said of the speed and intensity of the fire, which consumed football fields of land in mere seconds. “This was a horrific event.” Brother just sent this from #superior near or along Mccaslin Blvd I believe. #boulder #louisville @NWSBoulder @ai6yrham #marshallfire pic.twitter.com/T2Sml4ChEA Mandatory evacuations were issued Thursday afternoon for the 34,000 people who live in the towns of Superior and Louisville, in Boulder county, as giant black and grey plumes engulfed the residential and commercial areas. Residents in an area of Broomfield were also told to begin preparing to leave. “Life threatening situation in Superior and Louisville areas!” tweeted the National Weather Service in Boulder, alerting locals to gather their things and leave immediately. “Fast moving fires are in the area.” Videos posted to social media showed apocalyptic scenes. In one recorded by a shopper evacuating a Costco, throngs of customers are seen rushing outside into a windy parking lot clouded with dense smoke. Local news cameras captured scenes from a distance, showing black and grey plumes whipping through browned hillsides above lines of gridlocked cars inching toward escape.

Several structures were documented as they burned and officials said initial estimates show more than 580 homes had likely been consumed by the flames. A Target shopping center and hotel also burned. Six people have been admitted to the hospital with fire-related-injuries, according to local reports, and one officer was reportedly injured. Officials said there have been no reports of fatalities or missing persons.

12/31/2021,"Humpback whales are becoming an increasingly common sight off the coast of Britain, according to a marine review of 2021, but dumped fishing gear is causing a rising number of stranded seals and dolphins. Walruses, pufferfish and furrowed crabs were among the marine creatures from far-flung places that visited the UK and Ireland this year due to the climate crisis, according to the Wildlife Trusts, while puffins returned to the Isle of Man for the first time in 30 years after a rat eradication programme.  White-beaked dolphins were seen off Essex for the first time in more than two decades and native oyster populations have been re-established in Yorkshire, Essex and Northern Ireland after years of overfishing, pollution and disease. Sand lizards have been successfully reintroduced to Lancashire’s dunes. Conservationists said that 2021 had been a positive year for marine ecosystems around the British Isles, with schemes launched to restore seagrass meadows and huge kelp forests, which provide shelter for wildlife, including two species of seahorse. But a rise in cetacean strandings signalled trouble at sea. In Cornwall, more than 170 whales, dolphins and porpoises were stranded this year along with 247 seals, many injured due to fishing activity. Lissa Batey, head of marine conservation for the Wildlife Trusts, said: “It’s been a fantastic year for marine megafauna sightings, particularly in the south-west, but it’s clear that our oceans are under immense pressure from fishing, development, pollution, climate change and recreation. All these issues are having a huge impact on life at sea.” In Cornwall, a humpback whale was found stranded off Looe Island after being caught in fishing lines, while seven grey seals washed up on Mousehole beach within two days, linked with spider crab netting. Despite the strandings, significant numbers of humpback whales were spotted around the coast, once an extremely rare sight. More than 75 sightings have been recorded since 2019, a sign that populations are recovering after bans on commercial whaling, according to conservationists. The Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust saw humpbacks feeding around the islands with one individual, named Pi, staying for more than two months. More were seen in the Firth of Forth and off Shetland. Matt Slater, marine conservation officer for Cornwall Wildlife Trusts, said: “Only a few years ago, it would have been extremely rare to see a humpback whale around the UK. But it looks like they are chasing big shoals of sardines that are now present around our shores. It is magnificent to see these creatures up close.” In 2021, an Arctic walrus nicknamed Wally was seen around the coast of the UK, often spotted lying on boats, perhaps driven by melting sea ice in the polar north. A second walrus was seen off Northumberland and around Shetland. In October, a pufferfish washed up in Cornwall for the first time in 20 years, a species rarely found this far north. The Wildlife Trusts also warned there had been a rise in human disturbances of marine animals, with three times as many incidents since 2014. An increase in jet skis and motorboats is a leading cause for concern. This year, the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales witnessed a seal pup being abandoned by its mother after people were seen taking selfies with the pup. Dr Emily Baxter, senior marine conservation officer at North West Wildlife Trusts, said: “We’ve got amazing marine life in the UK and we’ve had some fantastic sightings this year, from sort of dancing sea slugs in Cumbria to puffins coming back. It’s important to remind people that actually, they don’t necessarily need to travel to far-flung places to see amazing marine life.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,Whales and pufferfish among ‘amazing marine life’ to visit Britain in 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/31/whales-pufferfish-amazing-marine-life-britain-2021-aoe
12/31/2021,"Every adult in England has now been offered a Covid booster jab, the government has announced . At the beginning of December, Boris Johnson warned in a televised speech that the UK was “facing an emergency in our battle with the new variant, Omicron”.  The prime minister said all adults in England would be offered a booster jab by the end of the year, adding that he was launching a “national mission” to achieve that. The target date had previously been the end of January. Johnson’s announcement came after evidence showed that having two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine does not provide strong protection against Omicron. However, a third dose provides about 70% protection against symptomatic infection. On Friday, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said the booster drive meant that “tens of millions of people” got to see “loved ones this Christmas”. He added that he was “incredibly proud” of the work the NHS had done to accelerate the programme, and thanked “the frontline staff, volunteers, armed forces and British public who have made it possible for us to meet this commitment”. More than 3,000 vaccination sites have been opened in England, with 180 new ones in December at football stadiums, shopping centres and Christmas markets. People have received letters and text messages inviting them to book booster vaccination appointments. Official data shows that more than 8m booster doses were administered in England – a 45% increase – in the period between 12 December and 30 December. The highest daily number of Covid booster jabs in England – 830,403 – took place on 18 December. More than 28.1 million people in England have now had their booster, including about 90% of those aged 50 and over who are eligible. This week, more than 1.5 million appointments were still available between 27 December and 3 January for anyone yet to get a top-up shot. The vaccines minister, Maggie Throup, said: “We have now offered all eligible adults in England a Covid-19 booster – a triumph for the NHS and the vaccination programme. “It’s never been easier to get your vaccine, with over 3,000 vaccination sites now open – so you can grab a jab in between shopping the January sales or watching your favourite football team play.”",News/Society,"Covid booster jab offered to all adults in England, says government",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/31/covid-booster-jab-offered-to-all-adults-in-england-says-government
12/31/2021,"Normally the summer Olympics are the pinnacle event for me to cover, but this year was not at all normal and I decided to give Tokyo a miss. Not only did my family not want me going, there were other factors to discourage me, not least the new rules that meant I might have very limited access. So instead my year was dominated by football, the peak being the final of the Euros at Wembley, a game that brought the country to a standstill and became one of the most-watched moments in British television history.  44mm lens 1/1600 f4.5 ISO 4000 My year started off in a very cold fashion with a trip to the Hawthorns, the highest professional league ground in the country. Despite the freezing conditions I loved it. It is pretty rare to shoot a football match in snow, thanks to either modern heated pitches melting it, or the games getting called off due to safety concerns for spectators. Back in January that obviously wasn’t the case as all games were being played behind closed doors. It was quickly apparent that the home side probably wished it had been postponed. They lost 4-0 to Arsenal, a dismal performance indicative of their season as a whole. The reason I like this picture is the bleakness of it all. Heavy snow falling in an empty stadium as all 10 outfield West Brom players, each one separate from the other, trudge back to the centre circle after conceding a goal. A very black and white image – perhaps a Christmas card for a Wolves fan? 400mm lens 1/2500 f4 ISO 640 In mid-January this special challenge match was the only senior men’s rugby game in Britain as all the others had been cancelled for Covid reasons. Ealing are a Championship team, in the second tier of English rugby, and Saracens were just about to start their season at this new level following their demotion from the Premiership. Most rugby matches I usually cover are in large stadia with tall stands circling the pitch. This wasn’t the case at Ealing and most of the pitch was bathed in low winter sun. Shooting backlit was beautiful, all I needed was the play to come near me into the right patch of light. For ages it seemed stuck at the other end, time ticking by and the sun rapidly descending. Eventually a maul formed where I needed it and I managed to get a few frames before clouds rolled in and everything went dark. 560mm lens, 1/1600 f4 ISO 4000 It was injury time at the end of this very dull 0-0 draw back in January. I was cold and had very few decent pictures. Suddenly the Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette launched himself at the ball across the back of Harry Maguire and flipped over in mid-air. It just goes to show you never know when something might happen to brighten up your day. 105mm lens 1/1250 f4.5 ISO 4000 One of the advantages of working in an empty stadium with a game played behind closed doors is that it gave me opportunities to put remote cameras in places I normally wouldn’t be allowed to, such as here in the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, on stairs right at the top of the massive South Stand. While I was down at pitch-level, I was setting off this camera up there. I love the view looking down on the goal, all neat symmetry and perfect lines. Even the groundsman with rubber gloves on, ready to pick up a loose ball from behind the goal, is standing right in the middle. As Jorginho stepped up to score a penalty for Chelsea, the only goal of this game, all the elements lined up perfectly. This frame is also a reminder of the pandemic age of football, a time when the game carried on without fans. 560mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 2500 The England captain Owen Farrell gets a fist in the face during his side’s 41-18 victory over Italy in the Six Nations. International rugby is such a hard, physical sport with a lot of close confrontations such as this. It is at moments like these that I often like to go in tight on the action with a very long lens. Sometimes it pays off, sometimes it does not. 145mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 3200 Normally for this game, which has always been one of my favourite fixtures, the Principality Stadium would be full of baying red-shirted fans. It is a perfect ground for rugby which, when full, crackles with intensity and passion. The Six Nations game there in February felt very surreal, the empty seats covered with giant waterproof sheets, one of which bore a fire-breathing dragon. I could not help but imagine what the noise would have been like as Wales won 40-24. 50mm lens 1/125 f1.6 ISO 400 In 2012 Lawrence Okolie weighed 19 stone and was working in a McDonald’s at London Victoria station. It was the final day of the London Olympics and in a break from flipping burgers he watched Anthony Joshua winning the heavyweight boxing gold medal on TV. The following day Okolie quit his job and vowed to be a boxer. In early April I went to photograph the 28-year-old from Hackney just a few days after he became the WBO world cruiserweight champion. I decided to photograph Okolie in the tiny gym at the bottom of his garden in Essex, cradling his newly-won world champion belt. 28mm lens 1/2500 f11 ISO 1250 In the hour before every Grand National there is always a buzz among the photographers at the course. Everyone asks “where are you going?” or “what’s your plan?” This year was no different and I remember talking to Steve Cargill, a racing specialist, as we headed out on to the track. In unison we both said: “What if Rachael wins?” and realised our goals were very similar, we had to be at the finish in case Blackmore created history and became the first female jockey to win the world’s most famous steeplechase race. I had photographed her success at Cheltenham the previous month, where she was crowned leading jockey, so knew she was in terrific form. Sure enough her horse, Minella Times, carried her to victory at Aintree. It was a real pity that spectators were not there to witness it, just a few owners watching on. It was quite eerie afterwards as she enjoyed the moment while at the same time caring for her horse, dousing it with water while the TV screen replayed her historic win in the background. 70mm lens 1/2000 f4.5 ISO 500 For a couple of weeks of the Premier League season in April and May it seemed the news agenda was not being set by matters on the pitch but rather what was occurring outside grounds. It was the time of fans’ protests, justifiably angered by six clubs announcing their intention to join a new European Super League. This radical proposal, which would have caused havoc to the game, came along when fans had been locked out for months. At Arsenal the fans’ grievances were directed squarely at the club’s owner, Stan Kroenke. Before a home match against Everton hundreds gathered. I went back inside the ground after photographing the demo. The game, in front of no fans, was desperate. Arsenal lost 1-0 but no one seemed that bothered with the result – the bigger news had been made outside. 16mm lens 1/400 f4 ISO 3200 Once I saw Caglar Soyuncu scoring the winner for Leicester at Old Trafford, I knew the most important pictures on that May evening would be taken on the other side of Manchester. United’s defeat meant City had won the Premier League. So I quickly got in the car after the final whistle and headed over to the Etihad. Sure enough hundreds of City fans descended on their ground to celebrate the title victory. One of them, pictured here, played up beautifully for the cameras, holding a can of lager and a flare in one hand, while smoking a rollup in the other. 840mm lens 1/1600 f5.6 ISO 800 There are times in Test cricket that are, let us just say, not quite as interesting as others. The third day of the first Test had been wiped out by rain, and the match was meandering towards a draw on the fourth afternoon. My mind started to wander. I had noticed, unusually for Lords, that quite a few pigeons had been pecking away at the square. This sort of bird activity I have always associated with the Oval. Anyway, I thought I would try to create a picture with them. Slowly a number started to congregate on a patch not far from the wicket being used. Kane Williamson, the New Zealand captain, played a shot then shouted for a run. The pigeons took off in unison, all apart from one, who stubbornly stayed put. 115mm lens 1/1250 f7.1 ISO 800 When the England players came out at Lord’s for the national anthems before the first Test in early June, they all wore black t-shirts with slogans on the back. It was a moment, designed by the ECB, as a show of unity with people of all backgrounds. These slogans mentioned ageism, ableism, transphobia, homophobia and religious intolerance. I decided for the second Test in Edgbaston to try to show the players wearing these t-shirts together so I went up to the TV gantry to shoot down on to the backs of the England team. It was only after taking the picture that I realised something was missing – why no mention of racism on any of the shirts? Then, just a few months later, the story of Azeem Rafiq and his treatment at Yorkshire made the headlines and I could not help but think back to this picture. 23mm lens 1/1600 f4.5 ISO 2000 Raheem Sterling scores the first goal for England against Germany in their knockout match at the Euros. It may have been less than half-full but I cannot recall Wembley ever sounding louder than at that moment. For all the matches at Wembley during the Euros, only 16 photographers were allowed pitchside due to Covid regulations and I felt very privileged to be there. However, rules that had prevented us from putting remote cameras right next to the net had been relaxed. It was great to be back shooting pictures such as this, after a Premier League season where these sort of cameras had been banished to behind the advertising boards. 400mm lens 1/1600 f3.5 ISO 4000 I wish I had been there in New York when Emma shocked the sporting world by winning the US Open. This image, taken at Wimbledon in July, is not a nice picture and I did not like taking it but sometimes you have to photograph what is the story of the day. The reason I am including it in this selection is to show what an amazing transformation Raducanu had in just a few months. From breathing problems and having to withdraw from her last-16 match at Wimbledon to winning the US Open as a qualifier without losing a set – remarkable. 400mm lens 1/2000 f4 ISO 4000 The England manager, Gareth Southgate, consoles Bukayo Saka after missing the final penalty in the shootout, handing Italy the Euros title. When I look back at this picture now it stirs up so many feelings, mainly of sadness, but also of pride and hope for the future. When I am actually at a game like this, I deliberately try to divorce myself from too much emotion. This is easier said than done but somehow putting a camera in front of my face helps keep my equilibrium and gets me to focus on what needs to be done. In this case it was to show the heartbreak for England as they missed out on winning a first title in 55 years. Once I saw Saka miss and then wander back towards the centre circle I stayed focused on him, ignoring the Italian celebrations. The 19-year-old buckled into the arms of his manager, burying his head deep into Southgate’s shoulder. For one split moment their legs matched each other, united in their despair. The symbolism struck me immediately. Southgate, having missed a decisive penalty for England at Wembley in the 1996 Euros, knew exactly the anguish Saka was going through. He seemed to wrap his arms round the player in a protective manner knowing exactly the sort of abuse that was heading the young player’s way. 61mm lens 1/2000 f22 ISO 320 It had been 10 years since I had photographed The Open. This picture was one I definitely could not have taken in 2011. Thanks to my current cameras having a silent function, I can now take pictures during the swing whereas a decade ago, without a silent shutter, that was forbidden. Now I can be up close to the player, just a few feet away in this case, and fire the shutter at any time. Royal St George’s was quite hard work for pictures this year, but one thing was in the photographer’s favour – the beautifully sunny weather. As Sandwich is the southernmost venue on the Open roster it also meant the sun set earlier than those courses in Scotland or northern England. This enabled me to get pictures such as this, as Morikawa, on his way to winning the title, teed off at the 18th on Saturday evening with the low sun sat perfectly behind him. With my shutter firing throughout his swing I manage to capture the beautiful bend of the club just before he hit the ball. 41mm lens 1/2500 f 5.6 ISO 400 The classic view of this ground for photographers has always been across the pitch to the gas holders behind but, due to building work both inside and outside The Oval, that is no longer possible. However a very different view has now opened up, one from high on top the new M.A.R. Galadari stand. It is spectacular up there, a bird’s eye view of the pitch with the cluster of skyscrapers in the Vauxhall development shooting upwards. This image shows a small boy in Indian team kit as he peers over a wall, intent on watching every little moment of play, seemingly oblivious to the backdrop. 168mm lens 1/2000 f4 ISO 800 Manchester United’s home game against Newcastle in September was about one man. T-shirts for sale outside the ground proclaimed this match as “The Second Coming of CR7”. It seemed a foregone conclusion that once Freddie Woodman, the Newcastle keeper, had spilled a shot just before half-time, you-know-who would be there to pounce on the rebound. One swing of the golden-studded boot and, 12 years after scoring his previous goal for Manchester United at Old Trafford, Cristiano Ronaldo had scored again. 155mm lens 1/500 f2.8 ISO 6400 As he walked out of the tunnel to defend his world heavyweight titles against Oleksandr Usyk, Joshua turned around to adoring fans and tapped his glove on his heart. Looking uncannily like Muhammad Ali in his pristine white gown, the British boxer seemed confident and relaxed, soaking up adulation from the phone-wafting spectators. They were all in for a very uncomfortable night as Usyk defeated a lacklustre Joshua. Even though there is hardly any light where this photo is taken, what is there is very soft, a perfect balance from tunnel, television and phone. 300mm lens 1/640th f2.8 ISO 6400 This marathon has always been one of my favourite events to cover. After last year’s elite-only race, it was great to see 40,000 runners on the capital’s streets again. Instead of going to the finish or one of the famous landmarks, I decided to do something a little different, going to a location that is very unglamorous but notorious for being incredibly hard. Just about at the 24-mile marker, where the dreaded “wall” often kicks in, are a series of tunnels under railway stations. These can produce dramatic variations in light and in this picture, of the leaders in the elite men’s race, I exposed for the dark conditions just as the runners entered the tunnel. Normally photographers like a dark background to show off the action but in this case it’s the opposite. Outside the tunnel went white, producing this very graphic and unusual athletics image. 24mm lens 1/3200 f7.1 ISO 1000 For the first time in two years, the NFL was back in London as the Falcons hosted the Jets. One aspect of the sport I like, and which often makes good pictures, is the way the home team are announced and they run out to a big fanfare, often through fireworks. I positioned myself in the corner from where the Falcons players would emerge. The obligatory dry ice started to pump all around me (quite a weird feeling) and then just before the big moment, the sun popped out from behind a cloud. Rather than shooting with the players running towards me, I spun round and shot them backlit, dashing away from me through the swirling smoke. 50mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 400 In early October the writer Simon Hattenstone and I went to Frankie Dettori’s house near Newmarket to do an interview that was timed for the release of his new book, Leap of Faith. I have photographed Dettori winning countless big races over the years and to see his trademark flying dismount off the most powerful of horses has always been a tremendous thrill. Before the shoot I asked Dettori to change into riding gear, so fair play to him for putting on the colours he wore to such great success on his favourite horse, Enable. After doing a few formal portraits just to warm him up, I steered him round to a paddock where I knew he had a couple of miniature donkeys called Pip and Plum. Well it had to be done. I asked him to pop on to Plum’s back and he obliged. Plum wasn’t having any of it and off Frankie came, stumbling as he exited. We all cracked up with laughter. From now on I don’t think I will ever watch his flying dismount the same way again. 35mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 3200 This was a pretty momentous day for Newcastle as they played their first game under their new Saudi owners. St James’ Park was buzzing with fans’ hope and anticipation. I was positioned in front of the Gallowgate End, Newcastle’s traditional home end, where almost everyone wears black and white. For the first few minutes of the game, and as the ball was at the other end of the pitch, I turned round and focused on a fan in the front row, decked out in a headscarf. Then Newcastle scored. The place erupted, a sense that all those years of despair had been left behind and here was a different Newcastle. What I like about this picture is not only the expressions of joy but also the one fan in the bottom right corner of the frame, a wry smile just about appearing on his face. Maybe he knew not to get too excited. Spurs went on to win the game 3-2. 400mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 4000 As the final whistle blew just moments after he had kicked a last ditch penalty, England’s new rugby union superstar celebrated beating the world champion Springboks. Marcus Smith was the figurehead for a much-changed England team this autumn. They emerged from a desperately poor Six Nations campaign earlier in the year to beat Tonga, Australia and South Africa in consecutive weeks. I am looking forward to seeing a lot more of Smith in the coming years. Not just for his inspired play but also because his hair flying everywhere makes for great pictures. Twickenham is a great place for shooting rugby, especially under lights. The backgrounds go nicely dark and because the crowd is so far back, the players stand out even more. 85mm lens 1/1600 f1.8 ISO 400 In early December I went to Cheltenham to shoot a portrait of the England football legend and the only man to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final. It was Hurst’s 80th birthday just a few days later and Donald McRae had conducted a poignant interview with him that had revealed some of the tragedies and hard times he had suffered alongside his many achievements. It turned out to be a rather bizarre photo session in a local park near Hurst’s home. The first thing he said to me, after seeing my various bags of kit, was “You going on holiday? This is just a quick snap isn’t it.” He quickly warmed up after chatting about how he did Joe Wicks’ workouts in this very park. I took him past the swings and on to a spot near a duck pond, an area I thought would be a bit quieter. It was not. A constant stream of dog walkers passed by quizzically looking at us. Eventually one stopped and asked Hurst: “You seen George and the kids today?” He turned to her and replied: “No. He may have flown over with them to the other pond.” Our national hero then proceeded to have a chat with this woman about the whereabouts of the park’s resident swan and its cygnets. I am sure she had absolutely no idea who he was. Hurst also told me that a few days earlier another woman came up to him and said: “I know who you are. You’re Glenn Hoddle,” to which Geoff said “Yes I am” and walked off. 24mm lens 1/1250 f2.8 ISO 4000 What makes someone in their seventies travel right across the world in the middle of a pandemic to race their bike through mud and freezing rain? When I saw the 2021 UCI World Masters Cyclo-Cross Championships were being held in East Anglia, I could not resist having a look. The conditions were pretty grim, very dark and overcast, but it could have been a lot worse. It has been many years since I photographed cyclo-cross and I had forgotten what a brilliant but tough sport it is. I came away with the utmost respect for all the competitors even if I thought they were slightly mad. 200mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 2000 It was late in this hotly contested London derby, the two teams level at 2-2, when the West Ham left-back Arthur Masuaku swung an intended cross into the Chelsea penalty box. Somehow the mishit swerved in the air, deceiving the goalkeeper Édouard Mendy, who dived in despair. The ball flew into the top corner of the net. West Ham had won and their push to the top four of the Premier League had continued.",Sport/Sport,Tom Jenkins’s best sports photos of 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/31/tom-jenkinss-best-sports-photos-of-2021
12/31/2021,"Britain is in an “incomparably better” position in the fight against Covid than it was at the end of 2020, Boris Johnson has said in his new year’s message, while Keir Starmer stressed his belief in a brighter future but said the virus remained a real threat. Both party leaders focused on the effect the pandemic had had on the country in their messages. The prime minister admitted there was anxiety about the Omicron variant and growing numbers of hospital admissions, and urged those who had not been vaccinated to get their jabs.  There was “one overriding reason” that tougher restrictions were not needed in the face of daily case numbers hitting record levels, he said – people “heroically, voluntarily and in almost incredible numbers heeding the call to get vaccinated”. Johnson was buoyant about the speed of the booster rollout, saying it was “precisely because of that huge national effort that we can celebrate tonight at all”. He still urged everyone in England to be cautious, take a test if going out and remember the importance of ventilation, and he told those in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland – who face tougher measures – that they should follow the respective rules in force across each nation. He also called people who were still unvaccinated or unboosted to get their jabs. “Look at the intensive care units and the miserable, needless suffering of those who did not get their booster. That could be you,” he said. “So, make it your new year’s resolution – far easier than losing weight or keeping a diary – find a walk-in centre or make an online appointment.” The Labour leader also called on people to “make the right choices, to come together” and forge a new sense of direction that he said would lead to a brighter future. Buoyed by a boost in the polls while the Conservatives’ vaccine bounce diminished, Starmer promised to set out “the ideas that I believe can build a new Britain” over the next 12 months. “Given the last two years our country has been through it would be all too easy to lose heart. But, like you, I believe in Britain. I believe the best still lies ahead for Britain,” he said. “That – if we make the right choices – together we can seize the future and make it work for every family in every part of Britain. That must be the true legacy of all the sacrifices and pain of the past two years of the pandemic.” Patriotism was not enough for success, he said, stressing the UK needed a leader who “can translate that pride into the action we need”. He said the events he was most looking forward to next year included the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, the Queen’s platinum jubilee and – as a football lover – the World Cup. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, used his new year message to stress he hoped 2022 would be “the year we will finally beat Covid” – but said it would begin with “many worries”. He said a potential “cost of living crisis” was already brewing, with heating bills on the rise and the threat of inflation, a “staff shortage crisis” with people off work isolating and a “political crisis” with the government divided and distracted at a crucial point in the pandemic.",News/World news,PM says UK doing ‘incomparably better’ against Covid in new year message,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/pm-says-uk-doing-incomparably-better-against-covid-in-new-year-message
12/31/2021,"Ralf Rangnick has revealed he warned his players about their body language following Monday’s insipid draw at Newcastle and was satisfied with the response as Manchester United saw off Burnley 3-1. United drew criticism for visible shows of petulance and a lack of togetherness during the 1-1 result at St James’ Park.  The interim manager was clear this had to stop. “In team sports it is always important you are convinced about what you are doing,” said Rangnick. “At Newcastle it was a difficult game for us, we were 1-0 down after seven minutes. They did well, we didn’t play well, especially in the first half. Therefore the reaction to what is happening on the pitch is the question. How do we react to this? Do we fight back, show them we are a team that believes in themselves, or do we shake our heads and wave our arms and help the other team and damage our own team? “For me it was clear to tell them it is important we work and behave as a team and don’t show these kinds of side-effects on the pitch.” Scott McTominay, who scored Thursday’s opener against Burnley and impressed throughout, admitted Rangnick was right to offer the warning. “Body language is one thing and the manager has come in and said he wants to cut that out, so that is final. We have taken it on board,” said the midfielder. A further strike from Cristiano Ronaldo plus Ben Mee’s own goal were answered only by Aaron Lennon, all goals coming before the break. This was Rangnick’s fifth game in charge and he praised his side’s attack. “I would say yes [our best display],” he said. “But whenever the ball was in our half there was still some space for improvement [defensively] but offensively I agree that was our best performance.” McTominay had been a doubt due to a leg problem. “We only decided this afternoon at two o’clock that he would play as he had some problems with the ankle contusion he suffered at Newcastle,” said Rangnick. “So it was good to have him available and in the team.” Jorge Mendes, Ronaldo’s agent, claimed the forward is content at United, following rumours of unrest. “Cristiano Ronaldo is very happy at Manchester United,” he told Sky Sports. “He’s going to continue with his solid, great performances as always in his career. It’s going to be a great season for him, I’m sure”.",Sport/Football,Ralf Rangnick happy with reaction after warning players over body language,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/30/ralf-rangnick-happy-with-reaction-after-warning-players-over-body-language
12/31/2021,"Joe Biden and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have exchanged warnings over the crisis in Ukraine during a 50-minute phone call that did little to lower the political temperature, according to their governments. Russia has alarmed the US and its allies by massing tens of thousands of troops near its border with Ukraine over the past two months. This follows its seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014 and its backing of separatists in eastern Ukraine.  Thursday’s talks, requested by Putin, were the leaders’ second conversation this month but, the White House said, consisted of both men restating their positions – including Biden warning of severe consequences if Putin decides to invade. “President Biden urged Russia to de-escalate tensions with Ukraine,” said Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, in a statement. “He made clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if Russia further invades Ukraine.” In a conference call with reporters, a senior administration official added that Biden had laid out “two paths”: one of diplomacy and deescalation, the other of deterrence “including serious costs and consequences” such as economic sanctions, strengthening Nato’s force posture and military assistance to Ukraine. The Kremlin, meanwhile, insisted that Putin had used the call to issue a threat of his own, telling Biden that new sanctions could totally rupture ties between Russia and the US and represent a colossal mistake. Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s foreign policy adviser, was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying: “Our president immediately responded that if the west decides in this or other circumstances to impose these unprecedented sanctions which have been mentioned then that could lead to a complete breakdown in ties between our countries and cause the most serious damage to relations between Russia and the west.” Ushakov added: “Our president also mentioned that it would be a mistake that our descendants would see as a huge error.” Biden, who is spending the week in his home state of Delaware, spoke to Putin from his home near Wilmington. The White House distributed a picture of the president speaking to the Russian leader from a desk lined with family photos. The call came ahead of a US-Russia security meeting in Geneva on 9 and 10 January, followed by a Russia-Nato session on 12 January, and a broader conference including Moscow, Washington and other European countries on 13 January. In the media conference call, a White House official described the conversation as “serious and substantive” but focused on setting the tone and tenor for the diplomatic engagements to come rather than breaking new ground. The official also acknowledged that Putin offered little clarity as to whether he plans to invade or back down. “We’re not going to draw conclusions and there were certainly no declarations as to intentions from this conversation. “But regardless, our focus is really on actions and on indicators, not on words at this point, so we’re going to continue to monitor very closely the movement and build-up of Russian forces on the Ukraine border and prepare ourselves for whatever decision ultimately is made by the Russian president.” Putin, who held a video call with Biden on 7 December, has compared the current tensions to the cold-war era Cuban missile crisis in 1962. He denies planning to attack Ukraine and insists that Russia has the right to move its troops on its own soil. Moscow has called for legally binding guarantees that Nato will not expand further eastwards and certain offensive weapons will not be deployed to Ukraine or other neighbouring countries. Washington regards some of the demands as non-starters. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, spoke on Wednesday with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. State department spokesperson Ned Price said Blinken “reiterated the United States’ unwavering support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity in the face of Russia’s military buildup on Ukraine’s borders”.",News/US news,Biden and Putin exchange warnings during phone call amid rising Ukraine tensions,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/30/biden-putin-call-russia-us-ukraine-tensions
12/31/2021,"Sebastian Coe has doubled down on his insistence that boycotting the Beijing Winter Olympics over China’s human rights record and treatment of the tennis star Peng Shuai would be a mistake, and says that dialogue and relationships are a better way of “flicking the dial” politically and socially. In his strongest intervention yet, the head of World Athletics and senior IOC member said that sporting boycotts were “historically illiterate and intellectually dishonest” and described the political boycott announced by the US, UK and other western countries as “frankly meaningless”.  Human rights groups have accused China of forcibly interning more than a million Uyghurs in re-education camps in Xinjiang, submitting them to forced sterilisations and intentionally destroying their culture, as well as destroying democracy in Hong Kong. That view is supported by the Biden administration, which earlier this month confirmed it would not send diplomats to the Winter Games due to “ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and other human rights abuses”. However, Coe insisted that a “balance” needed to be struck when it came to human rights and countries like China. He rejected claims that such a stance was ignoring the situation that the Uyghurs and others faced. “I’m not insouciant or cavalier about human rights, I take them very seriously,” he said. “But we have to be realistic, when we take our events around the world there are going to be challenges: culturally, politically, socially. I guess my fallacy position on this is always, in an imperfect world, sport is the one continuum that can actually create some stability. I’ve witnessed time after time the impact that sport has had in flicking that dial, socially, politically, economically.” When asked about boycotts, Coe, who led the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games Organising Committee, was blunt. “Boycotts on balance are historically illiterate and intellectually dishonest,” he said. “A political boycott is, frankly, meaningless. And in a world where I actually think discussion and relationships are important, rarely do I see isolation bearing fruit. “But that’s not to be an apologist for countries that do not conform to the basic standards around human rights. I’ve never witnessed sport leaving any country in worse shape than when it’s been there. The impact across the board can be, on many occasions, quite profound.” Last month the WTA suspended tennis tournaments in China due to concerns over Peng’s safety, but Coe defended World Athletics’ plans to double the number of Diamond League events in China to two next summer. “It’s for each sport to decide its own approach,” said Coe. “It’s not an approach we would take in World Athletics and I don’t think over the long haul it is one that actually achieves a great deal. There are always unintended consequences. And at the end of the day, the people that most suffer in all that are the athletes. “All athletes should be free to voice their concerns and they should be free to without fear of censure and they should be able to travel freely,” he said. “That is an important right. But we’re talking about extrapolating from that into boycotting a sporting event, and I think there has to be proportionality here, and I think there has to be balance.” Meanwhile Coe confirmed that the Athletics Integrity Unit would be stepping up its safeguarding efforts in the sport. It comes after the Guardian revealed that the top sprint coach Rana Reider is being investigated by the US Center for Safesport after multiple complaints of sexual misconduct were made against him. UK Sport is also looking into whether UK Athletics properly handled an allegation involving Reider and an 18-year-old sprinter when it was made in 2014. While Coe would not comment specifically on that case, he accepted that athletics had to do more to make the sport safe. “I don’t know what is taking place within UKA,” he said. “I’m sure they would want themselves to look at what happened and they will need to go back through that particular pathology. But one of the things that came out of our congress was to extend the mandate of the AIU. It can look more broadly at some of these safeguarding issues. “It can’t become the world’s policeman on this, but I think it will take a far greater interest in those kinds of issues. During the convention we had Charlie Webster tell her story, and I can tell you that within hours of that, both World Athletics and the AIU were contacted by federations who said they couldn’t sit any longer and watch certain individuals just getting jobs in the system knowing what they knew. It was as if their conscience got pricked on this. “If we are all being honest about it there are red flags that sometimes get ignored, and too often a problem is swept away from one federation and unwittingly ends up in another federation. It’s really important we are able to share that kind of information in federations wherever they occur, because there are too many of them.”",Sport/Sport,Sebastian Coe calls political boycott of Winter Olympics ‘meaningless’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/30/sebastian-coe-calls-political-boycott-of-winter-olympics-meaningless
12/31/2021,"How Manchester United needed this victory. It derived from one of their games in hand and moves them to 31 points, four behind Arsenal in the final Champions League berth, and was as emphatic as any display so far under Ralf Rangnick.  This does not mean, however, that all is tickety-boo with their play. The win came against a Burnley side who, due to four matches being postponed because of Covid, last played on 12 December and whose sole league victory, over Brentford, came on 30 October. Still absent is an overriding structure that can allow United to govern a game. Under Rangnick, they remain a side of moments: tonight it was enough to claim the three points but this lack of continuity should trouble their caretaker manager, who pointed afterwards to shakiness without the ball. Yet on an evening when a huge banner celebrating Sir Alex Ferguson’s 80th birthday on New Year’s Eve was unfurled in the Stretford End, Scott McTominay was in blistering form, scoring a superb opener, creating Cristiano Ronaldo’s goal and performing like a United midfielder should: as a force of nature. Can he do it week-in and out? Because this is the challenge facing the 25-year-old. “I was struggling this morning to play with my right foot but I pulled through it, I am fine,” McTominay said. “We are all learning and adapting [under the manager]. We play for Man United, and we need to get results.” Rangnick made six changes from Monday’s dire 1-1 at Newcastle – to freshen the side, he said – while Burnley’s covid travails claimed Josh Brownhill, Nick Pope, Jay Rodriguez and Kevin Long as its latest victims. Sean Dyche was also without the injured Ashley Barnes, Maxwel Cornet and Connor Roberts. This meant a first Premier League appearance since June 2020 for goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey and Aaron Lennon broke a three-month stretch without a start. Anything less than a home victory would cause scrutiny of the Rangnick project, five matches in. But what the 63-year-old saw initially concerned him as United allowed Burnley to run along their left and, when Matthew Lowton crossed from the other flank, they were thankful Chris Wood’s header was wild. Also off target was Ronaldo’s shot via a Luke Shaw through ball that saw the forward spoon over. But Ronaldo turned provider to open the scoring. Mason Greenwood cannoned the ball off a defender before pulling it back to Ronaldo whose touch was designed to allow him to let fly. Instead, McTominay was there to fire in, to Hennessey’s left, for a first United goal this season. Joy mixed with relief followed. But the play was fractured, pell-mell. What United needed was control but Burnley were defiant. Dwight McNeil and Johann Gudmundsson were driving in from the flanks and causing Aaron Wan-Bissaka to make vital blocks. Shaw, though, was in resurgent form, one barnstorming run ending with his shot smacking the side-netting. United soon scored again. Jadon Sancho veered in from the left and took aim but Ben Mee stuck out a toe and redirected the ball in for an own goal. The hosts had become rampant. McTominay scattered defenders in a run that finished with a clever ball to Ronaldo. His silky feet fashioned an effort but the shot was deflected. By 35 minutes it was 3-0, the excellent McTominay blazing a shot at Hennessey, who tipped the ball on to his left post, only for Ronaldo to tap in. This should have been contest over. But Harry Maguire proved a liability, his passiveness allowing Lennon to run through the defence and unload past David de Gea and into the corner. Dyche could use this as fuel for his interval chat. Burnley came out and tried feeding left-back Charlie Taylor along his corridor but Wan-Bissaka had his measure. Soon, the United right-back was running decoy, allowing Greenwood to serve the ball on to Ronaldo’s head, although his attempt was disappointing. A flowing sequence that featured another Shaw burst had Ronaldo dummying a pass, Cavani helping the ball on and Greenwood shooting. Hennessey repelled the effort. This passage of play continued the pattern of the match. Burnley were existing off scraps, United were doing what they should: dominating an inferior, severely depleted opponent. Yet their play meandered, De Gea’s 70-yard hack that went straight out of play illustrative of this. Leadership was required from Maguire or one of the de facto captains – Ronaldo, Edinson Cavani, McTominay or Shaw – to gee up the troops and get them moving in high gear again. Instead, Lennon again drove forward, Eric Bailly having to usher the ball out for a corner. United broke from this, Greenwood relaying to Sancho who played the ball to Ronaldo. His pass went back to McTominay who warmed Hennessey’s fingers again, firing in a 20-yard shot that was pushed on to the bar. With the score at 3-1 Burnley retained a sniff but this was dependent on them suddenly developing a killer edge. It was not to be, though James Tarkowski had an added-time chance for a consolation. While Raphaël Varane replaced the injured Bailly, there was scant alarm for a side who welcome Wolves on Monday. Again, only victory is enough.",Sport/Football,McTominay and Ronaldo on target as Manchester United ease past Burnley,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/30/manchester-united-burnley-premier-league-match-report

Scott Morrison said it was down to industry concerns, but the industries concerned deny lobbying about it. Follow Australia’s Covid developments today live right here. In non-Covid news, speculation is mounting that socialite turned convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell may try to cut a deal by naming names in a broader investigation of her ex-boyfriend Jeffery Epstein’s high society circle.

12/31/2021,"A little-known 17-year-old from Uzbekistan made a clean sweep of Magnus Carlsen and the global chess elite on Tuesday, incidentally setting a new world age record. Nodirbek Abdusattorov won the World Rapid championship in Warsaw, claiming en route the scalps of Magnus Carlsen and the No 1’s last two challengers, Fabiano Caruana and Ian Nepomniachtchi. In rapid chess, each player has 15 minutes for all moves, plus a 10 second per move increment. After 21 rounds of three-minute games on Wednesday and Thursday, France’s Maxime Vachier-Lagrave defeated Poland’s Jan-Krzysztof Duda in a tie-break to win the World Blitz title. The 18-year-old world No 2, Alireza Firouzja, was third, but Carlsen was well adrift in 12th place. He said: “Some days you just don’t have it. I was nowhere near close to the level I needed to be today.”  At 17 years three months, Abdusattorov becomes the youngest ever world champion in open competition, surpassing Ruslan Ponomariov at 18 in the Fide version of the then disputed classical crown in 2001. The next youngest were 22 – Garry Kasparov in his first victory over Anatoly Karpov in 1985, and Daniil Dubov and Sergey Karjakin when winning speed titles. The world women’s championship has a younger record holder, as Hou Yifan won it in 2010 aged 16, after being the defeated finalist two years earlier. Earlier in his blossoming career, the teen from Tashkent had won the world under-eight championship, defeated two grandmasters at nine, and been singled out in this column when he narrowly missed becoming the youngest ever GM at 12. Abdusattorov had his share of good fortune at Warsaw, surviving three lost positions, but he also played a very strong field where Levon Aronian and Boris Gelfand were among his other victims. After 13 rounds he was in a quadruple tie on 9.5 points with Carlsen, Caruana and Nepomniachtchi, but the regulations excluded Carlsen and Caruana from the play-off due to their inferior tie-breaks. An angry Carlsen denounced the rules as “ idiotic. Either all players on the same amount of points join the play-off, or no one does.” It was balancing luck for Nepomniachtchi, who in this same event and under the same rules in 2017 was excluded from the play-off, but the Russian was outgunned in the tie-break games. Abdusattorov easily drew with Black then won the second game despite twice missing mate in two near the end. Abdusattorov is the second player from Generation Z, defined as people born from 1995 to 2010, to break through to the chess top. Firouzja, whose victories in Latvia and Slovenia last month made him No 2 behind Carlsen in the global rankings, was out of form in Warsaw in the rapid but finished strongly in the three-minute blitz to take the bronze medal and narrowly miss out on the Vachier-Lagrave v Duda play-off. Yet another Gen Z player surged into the limelight when Bibisara Assaubayeva, 17, captured the world women’s rapid championship silver medal with 8.5/11, half a point behind Russia’s “chess Queen” Alexandra Kosteniuk. The teen from Kazakhstan did even better in the women’s blitz, reversing the result to take gold to Kosteniuk’s silver. Uzbekistan has long punched far above its weight in world chess. Four of its teenagers did well in last month’s Grand Swiss at Riga while Javokhir Sindarov, 16, finished in eighth place in the blitz at Warsaw ahead of many of the world elite. Long ago the old USSR set the standard for young talent with a golden generation including David Bronstein, Tigran Petrosian, Ewfim Geller and Mark Taimanov. England in the 1970s followed the Soviet model with Jon Speelman, Nigel Short, Michael Adams and later Luke McShane, Gawain Jones and David Howell. India and the US are doing best now with super-squads,but Uzbekistan is showing what can be achieved even by a small nation with the right approach to developing an elite. Fide has announced that the eight-player 2022 Candidates will be staged in Madrid in June-July 2022, with patronage from the Scheinberg family, who have previously backed opens in the Isle of Man and whose fortune comes from the sale of PokerStars for nearly $5bn. So far the qualifiers are Nepomniachtchi (loser of the 2021 title match), Caruana and Firouzja (Riga Grand Swiss), Sergey Karjakin and Jan-Krzysztof Duda (World Cup), Teimour Radjabov (Fide nominee), with the remaining two to come from the Fide Grand Prix at Berlin and Belgrade in February-March 2022. The Candidates and its winner have become even more significant than usual after Carlsen’s announcement that he will only defend his title if the challenger is from the new generation, so raising the stakes for the top two Candidates who could end up playing between them for the supreme crown. 3796: 1 Rc1!

12/31/2021,"After decades of fossil hunting in their spare time (he wooed her with two halves of an ancient beast’s vertebrae; they cut their wedding cake with a Neanderthal handaxe they had unearthed together), Sally and Neville Hollingworth made the discovery of a lifetime at the bottom of a quarry in Cerney Wick. It was a collection of mammoth bones of a size, state and number more usually found in Siberia than Swindon, left in the wake of the Thames’ ancient wanderings and dating from more than 200,000 years ago. While we wait impatiently for the 90-minute British romcom to be written by Frank Cottrell Boyce, starring Olivia Colman as Sally and Martin Freeman as Neville, as must surely come to pass, we have an equally endearing documentary about the fossil find itself. Attenborough and the Mammoth Graveyard (BBC One) opens with Sir David visiting the Hollingworths at their neat suburban home. Every wall is lined with shelves and cases housing immaculately presented fossils they have found. The mammoth bones are on the kitchen table. Attenborough floats through in a trance of delight. “It’s a great thrill, isn’t it?” the world’s most revered naturalist murmurs reverently, as he lays hands on a giant ice age humerus. “The whole of this business.”  It is a stroke of genius to put such a documentary on at Christmas. Prehistory is the greatest story yet untold, and the sight of passionate experts gleaning more of it from fragments of snail shell, sediment samples, notches on preserved shin bones and scapulae, then putting new scraps of the tale together, sends a shiver down the secular spine. It is the closest we spiritually impoverished lot will come to religious awe, but I wouldn’t trade it. Evolutionary biology professor Ben Garrod is the on-site missionary and co-presenter here, now that Attenborough at 95 is forced to take things a little easier. He does most of the interviews with the people pulling miracles from the mud then performing more of their own back in the lab. Generations of Siberians thought the buried remains they occasionally came across were evidence that huge, underground burrowing creatures once owned the tundra. Seventeenth-century Europeans thought theirs were evidence of giants or unicorns. Then in 1864 a piece of mammoth ivory was discovered in France with such a detailed engraving of the animal on it that it has been considered proof that humans lived alongside these elephant-like beasts and that unicorns, alas, didn’t really enter into it (nor giant burrowing creatures, which seems even more of a shame). Now, of course, we have people who can test the radioactivity of quartz grains, pull apart layers of rock and sediment like tissue paper, and consult a secure facility full of prehistoric knapped flints to tell you what was happening when Britain wasn’t yet an island, glaciers were retreating across a tiny patch of Wiltshire and megafauna were still roaming the Earth. As with most BBC documentaries involving natural history (and especially if they also involve Attenborough), it manages the graceful feat of sticking to the facts while still incorporating the sense of mystery that helps create the fascination. We are led to the answers of exactly what species of mammoth are resting at the bottom of the former river (steppe and woolly – I didn’t even know there were different kinds, although I know several 10-year-old boys who would howl at my ignorance), how so many animals came to die at the same place, and whether Neanderthal man could bring down large beasts from a distance or only at close quarters. We are led there via moments of marvelling at the skill needed to create weapons and tools out of stone, and the possibilities represented by a Levallois flake. Prof Garrod wonders, given his understanding of the behaviour of elephants, mammoths’ descendants, whether a juvenile had become stuck in the mud, the herd had panicked and nearby Neanderthals had taken advantage of the chance to avail themselves of weeks and weeks of food. Possibly. Maybe probably. Whatever the truth, it was a salutary reminder in these violently argumentative, polarised times that it’s OK to theorise. It’s OK to entertain options. It’s all right not to know. A great thrill, anyway. The whole of this business.

12/31/2021,"Boris Johnson is reportedly due to be cleared of breaking the ministerial code over payments for his Downing Street flat refurbishment after an independent adviser looked into whether he had been misled during an initial investigation. Lord Geidt led an inquiry that cleared the prime minister of wrongdoing in May, but is understood to have looked into a discrepancy between the findings in his report and another into the same matter published earlier this month by the Electoral Commission.  The issue centred on claims a Tory peer footed the bill for refurbishments to the No 11 flat. In his first set of findings, Geidt, the adviser on ministerial interests, said Johnson told him “he knew nothing about such payments” until immediately prior to media reports in February 2021. However the Electoral Commission’s own investigation said it had seen a WhatsApp message showing Johnson had been in direct contact with the donor, Lord Brownlow, in November 2020 about the flat refurbishment. Brownlow made a £58,000 donation to the Conservatives but the Electoral Commission found it was not declared properly and fined the party £17,800. According to the Financial Times, Geidt sought an explanation from Johnson and exchanged several letters with the prime minister that could be published in the new year. The newspaper also said Johnson’s behaviour was to be “criticised” and that Geidt had described the situation to colleagues as “deeply unsatisfactory” but would not change his ruling that Johnson had not broken the ministerial code. The result of the inquiry has been closely watched, given it could prompt the launching of another inquiry by the parliamentary standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, into whether Johnson broke the MPs’ code of conduct. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “We do not comment on speculation.” They also pointed to the terms of reference of Geidt’s inquiry, which said the advice Geidt gives to Johnson “will be published in a timely manner”. Asked previously if Johnson had lied to Geidt, the prime minister’s spokesperson said: “No.” Reports the prime minister is to be cleared have sparked anger from Labour. The party’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: “After the Electoral Commission ruled that the Conservative party broke the law on declaring donations, the prime minister has made a mockery of the standards the public has a right to expect. “While the British public is facing a cost of living crisis, Boris Johnson is busy writing to his own adviser about why he did not give him all of the information he needed for his investigation. “Lord Geidt should publish all his correspondence with the prime minister as a first step towards providing full transparency into how Boris Johnson is explaining away his WhatsApp messages with Tory donors. “It is embarrassing that when the country needs real leadership, Boris Johnson is busy trying to clear up his own personal mess.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson ‘to be cleared of breaking ministerial code’ over No 10 refurb,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/30/boris-johnson-to-be-cleared-of-breaking-ministerial-code-over-no-10-refurb
12/31/2021,"Confirmed daily Covid cases in the UK hit yet another high on Thursday, with 189,213 reported in the past 24 hours, while the number of people in hospital and deaths have also risen, data reveals. On Wednesday 183,037 daily cases were reported for the whole of the UK – a record at the time – although this figure included a backlog in some nations from before and during the Christmas period, with five days of case data included for Northern Ireland. Thursday’s newly reported cases for Wales covered a two-day period.  But experts have warned daily case figures do not include reinfections and not everyone who is infected has symptoms and takes a test, meaning despite cases reaching new highs the true number of infections will be higher still. The latest data also reveals that a further 332 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test. The figures are a steep rise on the 57 deaths reported on Wednesday. Experts say the jump is, in part, because NHS England has not reported hospital deaths since 24 December. The number of Covid patients in hospital has also increased in England, according to the latest data, with 11,452 reported on Thursday. In Scotland, it was announced on Thursday that there were 810 patients in hospital with recently confirmed Covid, an increase of 19.3% compared with the day before. Commenting on Twitter, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the record case figures reflect that Omicron is highly infectious. “Just as notable than cases is the steep rise in hospital occupancy, the largest single day increase in a while – a reminder that even if there is a lower percentage hospitalised through Omicron, sheer volume will still put acute pressure on NHS – and result in serious illness for many,” she wrote, adding that she was “appealing to everyone” to follow public health advice as the new year approached. In a written statement Mark Drakeford, the first minister of Wales, said that the public health situation in Wales “has deteriorated in the last week as the Omicron wave has arrived”, adding that while hospitalisations are lower than in previous waves, they are also are starting to increase. According to the latest figures the number of Covid patients in hospital in Wales is now 446, a 49% increase compared with last week. However, Drakeford said Wales was not reporting a rise in the number of Covid patients needing critical care. Prof Christina Pagel, director of UCL’s Clinical Operational Research Unit, said that reported case levels in England are now more than twice as high as the previous peak last January, and have not yet peaked, while cases are rising in all groups apart from under-10s. Hospital admissions, she added, are also rising in all age groups. While data suggested fewer admissions are leading to intensive care, Pagel said the situation was worrying. “An NHS crisis based on the wards instead of ICU is still an NHS crisis,” she tweeted.",News/World news,"UK Covid case numbers hit another record high at more than 189,000",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/uk-covid-case-numbers-hit-another-record-high-at-more-than-189000
12/31/2021,"Romelu Lukaku has given an explosive interview in which he states he is “not happy” with his situation at Chelsea, as the problems continue to mount for Thomas Tuchel. Chelsea’s record signing, who rejoined from Internazionale for £97.5m in the summer, has endured a frustrating campaign under Tuchel so far but has recently found his shooting boots with goals in his last two outings for the European champions.  The striker has scored seven goals in 18 matches this season but has been inconsistent and not always started matches under the manager. It is understood the interview was recorded three weeks ago, before Lukaku’s return to scoring form while he has since praised his manager after the 3-1 win at Aston Villa. “Physically I am fine,” Lukaku told Sky Italy. “But I am not happy with the situation at Chelsea. Tuchel has chosen to play with another system. “I won’t give up. I will be professional. I am not happy with the situation but I am professional and I can’t give up now.” Lukaku, who fired Internazionale to the Serie A title in May, said that he hopes to one day return to Inter, adding: “Now it is the right time to share my feelings. I have always said that I have Inter in my head. I know I will return to Inter, I really hope so. I am in love with Italy.” The release of the interview will provide an irritating backdrop for Tuchel who has seen his resources stretched by injuries and Covid-19 in the last month. Chelsea face Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on Sunday and will be without Reece James after the defender injured his hamstring in Wednesday night’s 1-1 draw with Brighton. Chelsea were awaiting scan results but fear it could be a torn hamstring which would necessitate a lengthy layoff for the 22-year-old. Tuchel is already without wing-back Ben Chilwell for the rest of the season while Andreas Christensen is a serious doubt to face Liverpool and Thiago Silva missed Wednesday night’s game through injury. Chelsea will make a late decision on Silva’s thigh issue but also on a host of players still suffering lasting effects after contracting Covid-19, including Timo Werner. Tuchel said: “[Werner’s] not good, not in training. And that’s because of Covid. We don’t know any more at the moment, and nobody knows quite how the players [who have had Covid] will react. We play trial and error and see what we get. That’s why I’m protecting my team. We can play much better but we need a full squad over weeks and weeks.”",Sport/Football,Lukaku ‘not happy’ with Chelsea situation as problems mount for Tuchel,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/30/lukaku-not-happy-with-chelsea-situation-as-problems-mount-for-tuchel
12/31/2021,"Quebec healthcare workers exposed to Covid-19 may have to go to work sooner than expected if staffing levels in the Canadian province’s facilities reach a critical point. Quebec’s health minister, Christian Dubé, made the announcement earlier this week, explaining that in a worst-case scenario the province would have no choice but to insist that isolating employees return to work.  Cases of the Omicron variant have surged in the province: on Thursday, a record-breaking 14,188 new cases were reported, with 939 Covid patients currently in hospital and 138 in intensive care. The Quebec newspaper La Presse reported that hospitals in the province were getting close to activating the contingency plan. The Omicron wave has wreaked havoc on the province’s healthcare sector, which is already stretched thin. “A few days ago, 4,000 [healthcare workers] were absent. Yesterday was 7,000. In the coming days, it will be 10,000,” Dubé said at a news conference on Tuesday. On Wednesday afternoon, government health officials explained how the employee recall process would work. Asymptomatic employees who were randomly exposed to Covid – at a shopping centre or gym, for example – would not have to isolate at all. Instead, they would be asked to self-monitor their symptoms for 14 days and get tested every two or three days. If they tested positive for Covid, they would be required to isolate for seven to 10 days, depending on staffing conditions. If they tested negative, they would have to return immediately. However, they would also have to isolate themselves at work for 10 days. With testing capacities in the province currently overwhelmed, this could mean that staff who are asymptomatic but positive end up working in healthcare settings because they have not been able to obtain a test. During the technical briefing, Dr Yves Jalbert, the medical director of Quebec’s public health protection, said those employees would have to take their coffee and lunch breaks in isolated rooms. A media spokesperson for the health ministry told the Guardian that in situations where the worker had to be near uninfected colleagues or patients, personal protective equipment (PPE) would be required. This new contingency plan applies to healthcare workers – along with other essential service staff such as first responders – who have had at least two vaccine doses. Meanwhile, asymptomatic employees who have Covid in their household or who are in regular contact with an infected person will be required to isolate for seven days, regardless of their vaccination status. However, double-vaccinated workers could be recalled sooner in urgent staffing conditions. Public health representatives at the technical briefing said 98% of healthcare workers were double-vaccinated. They said these measures were a last resort to prevent a total healthcare system breakdown. As Dubé noted on Tuesday: “If we had the staff we needed, we wouldn’t have to do this.” Healthcare unions opposed Quebec’s decision, saying the measures put workers – as well as vulnerable patients – at too much of a risk. Réjean Leclerc, the president of a union representing 120,000 Quebec healthcare workers, told Reuters that the province couldn’t even keep up with staff testingin the current situation. “The network is not prepared to face the risks of the government’s decision to bring asymptomatic infected staff back to work,” he said. The government has not clarified how it will help hospitals and other healthcare facilities to create isolation rooms, nor how it would help exposed or infected workers who depend on public transit to get to work. Other Canadian provinces, including Ontario, are considering whether to follow in Quebec’s footsteps because of healthcare staff shortages across the country.",News/World news,Isolating Quebec health staff may have to return to work early under new plans,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/isolating-quebec-healthcare-workers-return-work-covid-canada
12/31/2021,"The hardest part of picking a moment from the sporting year is trying to remember which of them actually happened in 2021. Twelve months that simultaneously took forever and went by in an instant. Perhaps the pandemic. Perhaps just middle age. I’m quietly confident that Euro 2020 did happen – a blur of podcasts, radio shows at Wembley Boxpark, and England reaching the final of a major tournament for the first time in 55 years. Two days before the final I caught myself idly wondering if I actually wanted us to win. Was this the right time? So many England fans have pleaded: “Just once in my lifetime.” But if it did happen, what then? Where does the journey go?  Was this the right set of players to be deified for the next 50 years – to take the mantle from Moore, Charlton and Hurst? Supremely likable and talented, maybe – but I’ve seen John Stones have bad games. I’ve seen Luke Shaw have average seasons. I’ve spent so much time watching Kieran Trippier and Kyle Walker doing mundane things, just taking throw-ins and whipping crosses in to no one in particular. I’ve seen Harry Kane’s “let’s get them, lads” team talks. I’ve never seen Ray Wilson have a bad touch, nor George Cohen misplace a pass. I’ve never seen Bobby Charlton not score from 25 yards. Bobby Moore is always tackling Pelé and strolling away with the ball. Nobby Stiles just dances. For a short time in the 80s, when I was old enough to love football but too young to understand time, I thought Gordon Banks had won the World Cup with just one eye. How could Jordan Pickford compete with that? I’ve never seen any of them warm up, get substituted or send a mundane Insta post. @Bigjackiecharlton: “Great win against a tough Argentina side, bring on Portugal in the Semis.” Granted, I’ve barely seen any of the boys of ‘66 play a minute of football, aside from a digitally enhanced repeat of the final and a few grainy YouTube highlights. Since I knew what the game was, these 11 men were otherworldly superhumans – players who have improved as every year passes. Hurst’s shot always goes in the top corner. They’ve only ever won the World Cup. And they’ve done it time after time after time. A month before Italy broke our hearts, millions of us watched Christian Eriksen’s stop. Each chest compression was broadcast to the world as the director cut from family members to teammates and back. As a screen was erected around him like a faller at Becher’s Brook, social media raged about the cameras zooming in on a life ebbing away. Yet we carried on watching. There was an emptiness that hung in the air that afternoon and an inescapable relief when it emerged he was OK. We shouldn’t have seen it, but in a perverse way perhaps it was good that we did. It reminded us that the game didn’t matter – results didn’t matter. Life mattered. #Bekind – hug the ones you love. And more cliches. Live for the moment, carpe diem, break-down-the-Wembley-barricades-and-set-fireworks-off from-your-anus. I’d hosted a TalkSport show from a pub round the corner on the morning of the final. I was the only person getting on the tube at Wembley Park at 1pm as thousands of hammered, ticketless fans streamed the other way – you could tell it was going to be an ordeal for anyone in a hi-vis vest. And maybe that grand show of unpleasantness and stupidity eased the blow of the defeat. We were recording Guardian Football Daily in my living room straight after full-time. Producer Joel, John Brewin and I were representing England, with Barry Glendenning (Ire) and Elis James (Wal) neutral – or, more accurately, supporting Italy, one more vociferously than the other. By the time Shaw hammered home in the second minute, my midweek existential crisis had given way to the unedifying shouty faux-cockney that I appear to morph into during England games. I hadn’t become one of football’s great philosophers that week – I was just a man nervously drinking Peroni, eating Kettle Chips and yelling “SHAPE” for a 120 minutes. Every one of those penalties was excruciating. Even when we scored. Pickford keeping out Jorginho. The hope. The inevitability. Bukayo Saka’s miss. The silence. I have the emotional skillset to deal with desperate defeat. I wouldn’t have known what to do in victory. The neutrals were gracious. We recorded the pod. They waited until getting in Elis’s car before tenderly embracing. I don’t hold it against them. It must have felt so sweet – another two years (or 18 months) at least of hurt. No endless phone-ins demanding he become Sir Mason Mount just yet. The following morning, amid the depressingly predictable racist messages received by Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Saka, I was on an 8am train to Cornwall, my mockney accent stowed away until the next tournament. I read pages of reports of the previous night, picking over every aspect of it. And I didn’t mind – defeat was fine. We go again. The biggest sporting day of 2021 taught me something I already knew. I am desperate to win – I really, really care. But the moment it’s gone, it’s just gone. And it’s OK. Your team – club or country – doesn’t change. We all do go again. I look forward to the draw, the wallchart, the endless speculation about who will play at left-back, the frantic calls from people who should know better to play all of the attackers all of the time. It will all come round again in Qatar in November; given the shameful nature of everything connected with that tournament, the results will matter even less. I think of the boys of ’66 we lost this year. I think of Eriksen, alive and planning his future. The results are the least important part.",Sport/Football,My main lesson from 2021?

12/31/2021,"Joe Biden will speak on Thursday with Vladimir Putin regarding the Russian president increased security demands in eastern Europe. The two leaders will discuss a range of topics, including “upcoming diplomatic engagements in Russia”, said US national security council spokesperson Emily Horne in a statement announcing the call.  Thursday’s talks come at the request of Russia amid Russia’s increased security presence near Ukraine as the US and its allies watch on warily. The buildup of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border has grown to an estimated 100,000 and has fueled fears that Moscow is preparing to invade Ukraine. Moscow has also announced it would hold new joint military drills with Belarus in February or March. “This dialogue should, and we expect will, proceed on the basis of reciprocity. There will be topics where we can make meaningful progress and topics where we will have differences. That’s the nature of diplomacy,” said a senior Biden administration official in a background press call. The Kremlin has said that Putin wants to speak with Biden as part of the preparations for a formal round of security talks set to begin between US and Russian delegations in Geneva next month. Asked why the Kremlin had requested an additional phone call with Biden, Putin’s press secretary Dmitry Peskov said: “This is because of the substance, the items on the agenda are extremely complicated.” Russia has demanded that Nato pledge not to admit Ukraine into the military alliance and that it remove its troops and military infrastructure from countries that joined after 1997. The United States has said it will not discuss issues that affect its allies’ security without their direct participation and has sought to assuage their concerns ahead of the call. On Wednesday, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, spoke with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. According to state department spokesman Ned Price, Blinken “reiterated the United States’ unwavering support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia’s military buildup on Ukraine’s borders”. “We have had very good discussions with the Ukrainian side in terms of short-term confidence-building measures that they have put on the table with the Russian side… We have seen a real willingness on the part of the Ukrainian side to put forward proposals aimed at confidence building de-escalation,” the senior official said. The talks between Biden and Putin will begin late on Thursday evening in Moscow and are expected to be conducted in private. In a New Year’s greeting published by the Kremlin ahead of the call, Putin said: “I am confident that, following up on our agreements reached during the June summit in Geneva and subsequent meetings, we can move forward and establish an effective Russian-American dialogue based on mutual respect and consideration for each other’s national interests.” Earlier this month, Biden and Putin held a virtual summit regarding the Ukraine crisis but made little apparent headway. “The discussion between President Biden and President Putin was direct and straightforward. There was a lot of give and take, there was no finger-wagging. But the president was crystal clear about where the United Stated stands on all these issues,” said the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. During those talks, Putin demanded “reliable, legal guarantees” that would prevent Nato’s expansion towards Russia or place missile systems in Russia’s bordering countries. Shortly after the talks, Russia put forward a list of highly contentious security guarantees it says it wants the west to agree to in order to reduce tensions in Europe and defuse the crisis over Ukraine. The demands include a ban on Ukraine from entering Nato and limiting troop deployment and weapons to Nato’s eastern flank. Russia has also asked Nato to not hold drills without previous agreement from Russia in Ukraine, eastern Europe, in Caucasus countries or in central Asia. Peskov said the two leaders are expected to continue discussions that began at the video summit and that they would also discuss upcoming talks between Russia and the US, Nato, and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe set to begin in mid-January. Moscow has said that ignoring its interests will result in a “military response” similar to the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. Putin announced this week that he will hold new joint military drills with Belarus, which also borders Ukraine. The drills are scheduled for February or March, Putin said after meeting with Belarus’s Alexander Lukashenko. He did not say how many troops would take part in the drills or what their objective would be. On Sunday, Putin said he would consider a slew of options if the west fails to meet his push for security guarantees precluding Nato’s expansion to Ukraine. In Wednesday’s statement, Horne said: “President Biden has spoken with leaders across Europe, and Biden administration officials have engaged multilaterally with Nato, the EU and the OSCE [Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]. “The Biden administration continues to engage in extensive diplomacy with our European allies and partners, consulting and coordinating on a common approach in response to Russia’s military build-up on the border with Ukraine.” The senior official said that the US is “also prepared to respond if Russia advances with a further invasion of Ukraine”. “We have made plans to reinforce Nato’s force posture in allied states in the event of a further invasion, and we are prepared to provide Ukraine with further assistance to defend its territory,” he added. Nevertheless, he reiterated that Biden will emphasize to Putin that “there is a clear diplomacy path to de-escalating tensions in the region if President Putin is interested in taking it”.",News/US news,Biden to speak with Putin amid Russia’s increased presence near Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/29/joe-biden-vladimir-putin-talks-russia-ukraine
12/31/2021,"The French government has suspended a new rule that prevented British nationals legally resident in other EU countries from travelling through France to reach their homes, a move that caused confusion for thousands of travellers. Border officials would “show tolerance” in order to “allow these nationals to transit through France to reach their residence in a country of the European Union after the Christmas and New Year period”, the interior ministry said in a statement. It came as Germany also relaxed rules for British visitors.  Tighter Covid travel rules introduced last week appear to allow only Britons whose primary residence is in France into the country, although EU law experts have questioned their legality. The strict application of the no-transit rule in particular was causing difficulties for those who had gone back to the UK for the holidays “in good faith” but were now unable to return to their country of residence, the ministry acknowledged. Some British travellers trying to reach countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium by car were turned back by French border officials in the UK on Wednesday night after Eurotunnel issued a warning about the new rule. Eurotunnel said a French government decision this week meant that “unless they hold French residency, British citizens are now considered third country citizens and can no longer transit France by road to reach their country of residence in the EU.” P&O Ferries issued a similar tweet, warning that “only those with French residency will be permitted to enter France”. The British embassy in Paris said last week that “UK nationals may only transit France if travelling by air.” However, British nationals travelling through France to their homes in Belgium by the Eurostar train service have reported no problems reaching their destinations. A French interior ministry official said earlier the country had not changed its list of “compelling” reasons enabling Britons to travel to France since new rules were introduced, but “clarified their application” by border police. The French government announced last week that incoming travellers would require “a compelling reason to travel to, or come from, the UK, both for the unvaccinated and vaccinated” from midnight on 11pm GMT on 17 December. “People cannot travel for tourism or professional reasons,” it said. A list of valid “compelling reasons” allowing travellers specifically from the UK to enter France published on 16 December includes EU citizens living in France or transiting through France to reach their home in an EU member state. It also includes third-country nationals “with a valid French or EU residence permit or long-stay visa resident in France”, as well as “British nationals … benefiting from the Brexit withdrawal agreement” (in other words, living in the EU before 31 December 2020) – but with no reference to where in the EU they are resident. Moreover, the government’s list of “compelling reasons” applicable to countries on France’s Covid red list includes “third-country residents with a valid French or EU residence permit or long-stay visa whose primary residence is in France, or who are transiting through France to reach their primary residence in an EU country”. European law experts have questioned whether applying a no-transit rule to British residents of EU member states travelling through France breaches the Schengen Borders Code, which governs who may cross the EU’s external borders. Since the border between France and the UK is an external border of the EU, there would normally be no legal basis for France to refuse to allow third-country nationals legally resident in another EU country to cross it to reach their member state of residence. I was refused boarding at Dover. Completed all of the French documents from the Government web site at 23:30 the previous evening. I asked for a supervisor at passport control and asked him to show me the new rule but he said that he couldn’t but it was an order from FR Gvt “In my view there’s a strong argument that France is in breach of the Schengen Borders Code,” said Steve Peers, professor of EU law at the University of Essex. “The code has a public health requirement for crossing external borders, but there’s a derogation for those holding a residence permit from a member state and in transit, unless they are subject to a national entry ban of the state they are crossing.” France’s UK-specific list of permitted “compelling reasons” for transiting through France includes passengers of any nationality spending “less than 24 hours in an international zone” of a French airport. In principle, this implies that if and when France reapplies the no-transit rule to British nationals and it is not challenged, those resident in other EU countries will only be able to transit through France and return home by air. A UK government spokesperson said: “The French authorities have confirmed that British nationals will face no additional restrictions while travelling through the holiday period. British nationals who are currently in the UK, but resident in the EU, will be able to return to their home through France over the New Year period without disruption. We remain in close contact with the French authorities, and will update our own travel advice with the latest information.” Meanwhile it was announced that Germany is to ease restrictions on travel from the UK. From 11pm on 3 January, a ban preventing British tourists from travelling to the country will be lifted, according to the German embassy in London. It means that people who are fully vaccinated, or “have an important reason for travelling”, will be allowed to enter. Those who are fully vaccinated will not need a negative Covid test or need to quarantine for 14 days, the embassy said.",News/World news,France suspends rule denying British residents of other EU countries transit,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/french-border-officials-in-uk-turn-back-british-residents-of-other-eu-countries
12/31/2021,"Schools and businesses will suffer next if widespread shortages of Covid tests continue, after staffing difficulties in hospitals and care homes. With the government’s website indicating no availability for PCR tests at walk-in services or by home delivery, and pharmacies continuing to struggle to meet demand for lateral flow test (LFT) kits, sector leaders say the shortages will have knock-on effects once the UK emerges from the holiday period.  Transport: train operators struggling to stay on track Train services have been disrupted by staff shortages caused by Covid. Great Western Railway said: “With rising numbers of staff unavailable to work because of positive Covid tests and having to self-isolate, we have taken steps to maintain service levels across the network. Unfortunately, this includes planned cancellations designed to minimise the impact on as many customers as possible.” West Midlands Railway said the Omicron variant was having “a significant impact” on its workforce. ScotRail said its services would be disrupted until 28 January because of a shortage of train crew, and services could be cancelled or changed at short notice. A shortage of staff has led Southern to halt services to and from London Victoria for two weeks. The routes had already been suspended this week due to engineering works, and the staffing problems mean the suspension will continue until 10 January at the earliest. Schools: test shortages have potential to delay start of term The Department for Education announced in November that secondary schools in England would need to test all pupils twice on site before they can return to the classroom. Schools have been given flexibility over when to carry out the tests, with many expected to spread out returns over the latter half of next week. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “Schools and colleges are able to order lateral flow device test kits through an online ordering system … These orders are due to be delivered in the week commencing 3 January, and we have not been notified by the government of any issues affecting supply.” Several headteachers who spoke to the Guardian said they had stockpiled enough kits to test pupils, but feared that shortages of tests for teachers and other essential school staff such as caterers were likely to be a bigger problem. Care homes: slow results making staffing issues worse Some care homes have stopped allowing in visitors because of staff shortages, which have been affected by lengthening delays in getting results from walk-in tests. Care home staff are required to have two lateral flow tests and a PCR test each week. Nadra Ahmed, the chair of the National Care Association, said care homes were reporting delays of four days in getting PCR results, meaning the results were out of date before they arrived. “Agency nurses are not turning up, managers are having to work day shifts and night shifts just to keep the service covered – it has been horrendous. We continue to support families visiting where it is safe but some providers have had to close to visitors because they don’t have the staff to support safe visiting,” Ahmed said. Vaccinated residents who leave a home temporarily have to be tested for the following 10 days after they return, meaning availability of tests is crucial. NHS: call for tests to be reserved for staff NHS staff are required to take twice weekly tests but are not given access to lateral flow tests from their institutions and must seek their own, after a change in guidance over the summer. The surge in demand has hit NHS staff’s access to LFTs, leading to fears of staff shortages. Unison, one of the main unions representing health workers, said NHS leaders needed to “up the pressure” on the government to reserve tests for NHS staff if stocks were low. Helga Pile, Unison’s deputy head of health, said: “NHS workers are under enough pressure as it is without the additional worry of obtaining tests.” The call for priority testing for NHS staff has been supported by the Royal College of Nursing, NHS Providers and the British Medical Association, after reports that NHS trusts are reporting high numbers of absences related to Covid. Hospitality: tests needed for celebrations to go ahead A lack of tests in England could mean the efforts of restaurants, clubs and pubs to host New Year’s Eve celebrations are in vain, industry representatives said. With Boris Johnson and ministers telling the public that they needed a test before safely partying on 31 December, the hospitality sector said bookings remained at about half of that seen in a normal year. A lack of test kits could lead to that figure falling further. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, said: “We need to make sure people have access to tests so they can continue to come to work as well as partying.”",News/World news,"Covid test shortages will affect staffing in schools and businesses, leaders warn",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/covid-test-shortages-will-affect-staffing-in-schools-and-businesses-leaders-warn
12/31/2021,"Dominic Raab has been pictured without a mask at a Chelsea match this week, despite the club having urged fans to keep face coverings on while seated in the stadium. A spokesperson for the deputy prime minister and justice secretary said he “followed the rules at all times”, given that government guidance states masks only need to be worn indoors at sport stadiums.  However, the government has urged people to exercise extreme caution in the run-up to New Year’s Eve, with the Omicron variant fuelling a surge in cases to record high levels. There were 183,037 new infections reported across the UK on Wednesday, when Raab travelled to Stamford Bridge to watch Chelsea’s draw with Brighton and Hove Albion. The home club issued “important information” for fans attending the game, telling them: “Supporters will be required to wear masks in all indoor areas of the stadium, including the concourses, except when they are eating or drinking. Masks are not required when seated or walking outside the stadium, but they are recommended.” A supporter near Raab took a photo of the unmasked cabinet minister next to another fan who did appear to be wearing a face covering. Others in the background can be seen without one. An observer who wanted to remain anonymous said: “Personally I find it quite surprising that a senior minister would think it wise to sit in a tightly crowded public arena and ignore health recommendations to wear a mask for 90 minutes during this Omicron surge. “For me it’s his decision-making which should be called into question. It’s a busy football game, he can be easily spotted and Covid cases are high. He’s not really bothered about setting the best example.” A spokesperson for Raab said: “He followed the rules at all times.” Ministers have advised people to be extra careful during the festive period given that people are likely to be mingling more with elderly relatives. The rules remain that people only need to get a Covid test for certain reasons, but health officials have gone further in light of Omicron’s spread and a reluctance by minister to implement any tougher restrictions than plan B. Some government advisers have suggested people should adapt their behaviour further than the rules, for example by deprioritising socialising or getting tested before they meet up with friends. Ministers have been accused before of failing to set a good example. Boris Johnson was pictured not wearing a mask during part of a visit to a hospital in Northumberland last month. At the time, Raab defended the prime minister, telling Sky News: “Like many of us, we take the advice and guidance that we’ve got in different settings and that’s the right thing for us to do as politicians and it’s the right thing for the public to do.”  This article was amended on 30 December 2021.

12/31/2021,"The viability of thousands of small businesses is at risk as escalating energy costs take their toll on companies just as they try to recover from Covid restrictions, according to a stark warning from their federation. Small businesses, which employ almost 13 million people in the UK, are expected to feel the brunt of crippling energy costs in the coming weeks as firms begin to strike new fixed-term deals amid record high energy market prices across Europe.  The UK’s micro businesses, which employ fewer than 10 people each but a total of 4.2 million employees across the country, are “in trouble” due to the national energy crisis ignited by record energy market prices, according to a warning from the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). A survey by the group found that energy costs are the biggest concern facing its members and warned that they could pose an “existential threat” to firms that have already been dealt a blow by Covid restrictions. “This is a cruel pincer,” said Craig Beaumont, at the FSB. “It will lead to some businesses realising they cannot continue as is, either [by] trying to slash costs or, the last thing they want to do, lose people. Or they could have to give up altogether, shutting the business down and letting everyone go.” The looming risk to millions working in the small business sector threatens to compound a “cost of living catastrophe” in the spring, driven by stalling wages and rising tax and energy bills, which could make 2022 the “year of the squeeze”, according to the Resolution Foundation. The FSB is expected to reveal next week that almost half of its members consider energy bills to be the biggest potential “disruptor” to their businesses, over and above supply chain concerns and worries about the cost of fuel, which have reached record highs after a rebound in the global market price for oil. “It is micro businesses which are the ones in trouble. Many small businesses tend to buy their energy via fixed rate deals but when these end they face much higher charges,” Beaumont said. “For some, energy costs could prove to be an existential threat, particularly for the fragile end of the small business sector which is emerging from Covid-19 restrictions,” he said. “Anecdotally, we’ve found that energy bills are the main reason why some small businesses have remained closed and kept staff working from home. It is one of the only ways they can protect their finances against these costs.” Senior officials from the business department, the Treasury, No 10 and the energy regulator have met energy companies in a series of emergency talks over recent weeks in an attempt to avert a national energy crisis which could drive the average home energy bill to £2,000 a year by next April. The regulator, Ofgem, put forward a proposal on Thursday to help smooth the cost of recent energy supplier collapses which might otherwise add about £100 a year to the average energy bill. A spokesperson said the cost of its safety net had protected the credit balances of more than 4m households after the collapse of their supplier. However, the same protection is not offered to small businesses. “Small companies don’t have the commercial clout of larger firms which are able to negotiate competitive longer-term energy tariffs with a supplier, but they don’t qualify for the same regulated protections which are offered to households either,” Beaumont said. Senior industry sources said energy companies have argued in favour of a £20bn Treasury-backed fund, which could provide loans, repayable over a number of years, to help suppliers meet their costs without sudden hikes to home energy bills next year. There have also been calls to remove the 5% VAT charge from energy bills and move some policy costs into general taxation. The FSB is understood to have asked the government to extend many of the protections offered to households to help safeguard small businesses too. A spokesperson for the business department said it was “in regular contact with Ofgem and business groups” to explore how small businesses can be supported to manage the impact of rising global prices. Ofgem declined to comment.",News/Business,Energy costs and Covid pose ‘existential threat’ to UK’s small businesses,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/30/energy-costs-and-covid-pose-existential-threat-to-uks-small-businesses
12/31/2021,"The South Africa wicketkeeper-batter Quinton de Kock has retired from Test cricket with immediate effect.  The shock announcement from the 29-year-old came on the day the Proteas suffered a 113-run defeat to India in the first Test at Centurion and comes during a controversial year for the player, who apologised after refusing to take a knee during the World Twenty20 tournament. De Kock said he wanted to spend more time with his family – with his wife expecting the birth of their first-born child in the coming days – but the decision was still a surprise given CSA had agreed to give him time off for the rest of the three-match Test series to attend the birth. “This is not a decision that I have come to very easily,” De Kock said in a statement. “I have taken a lot of time to think about what my future looks like and what needs to take priority in my life now that Sasha and I are about to welcome our first child into this world and look to grow our family beyond that.

12/31/2021,"During a long, combative career in US political life, Harry Reid, who has died aged 82, made his most telling contribution as Democrat majority leader in the Senate. There, in 2010, he pushed through and then vigorously defended President Barack Obama’s groundbreaking healthcare reforms. Given the huge strength of Republican feeling against “Obamacare”, the president needed a streetfighter to drive his measures through to the statute book – and Reid was the man for the job. Quietly spoken but toughened by a hard early life and years spent swimming in the shark-infested waters of Nevada politics, he fought through the deeply polarised atmosphere that surrounded Obama’s health reforms to shepherd the Affordable Care Act through the Democrat-controlled Senate.  Just as importantly, he defended that landmark piece of legislation – which aimed to extend health insurance to more than 30 million uninsured people – against repeated attempts at derailment by a Republican-controlled House of Representatives. In particular, he orchestrated Senate resistance to House amendments that would have emasculated Obamacare, and in 2013 brokered a deal that ended a partial government shutdown engineered by Republicans in protest at the legislation. Obamacare aside, in Washington Reid was a centrist Democrat, and for the liberal wing of the party far less dependable than his firebrand counterpart in the House, Nancy Pelosi. He was opposed to abortion, supported the 1991 Gulf war, and at first backed George W Bush’s 2003 invasion of Iraq, although in 2007 he came out against the second conflict there. He also raised more than a few hackles when he observed that Obama had been helped in his presidential campaign because he was “light-skinned”. But Reid survived that problem, as he survived so many others on the road to his elevated position in the Senate, and Obama acknowledged the early encouragement that Reid had given to his presidential aspirations. To the Democrats, he was a usefully blunt, outspoken scrapper who was happy to tackle the Republicans head on – and was prepared to publicly call Bush a “liar” and a “loser”. Although a pragmatist, he would not cut deals with the Republican leadership on what he saw as vital issues. “I know my limitations,” he once said. “I haven’t gotten where I am by my good looks, my aesthetic ability, my great brain or my oratorical skills.” Reid’s strengths were his sheer energy and political shrewdness, honed during a long rise to the top from difficult beginnings. He was born in Searchlight, Nevada, a tiny, searingly hot former gold-mining town in the Mojave desert, in a shack that had no toilet or hot water. Until the 1950s, Searchlight was best known for a notorious brothel called the El Rey, where it was said that Reid’s mother, Inez (nee Jaynes), did the laundry. His father, Harry Sr, was a miner and an alcoholic; in 1972 he shot himself. There was no high school in Searchlight, so Reid had to stay with relatives 40 miles away in Henderson, outside Las Vegas, where he went to high school at Basic Academy. His lucky break came there in the burly shape of Mike O’Callaghan, the school’s football and boxing coach. Young Reid was tough: he boxed as a middleweight and played on the football team. “I’d rather dance than fight, but I know how to fight,” he said later. An ambitious young man, he graduated from Utah State University, where he became a Mormon. He went to Washington DC and found a job with the US Capitol police, who are charged with protecting Congress, while he worked for a law degree at George Washington University. From there he returned to Nevada to become a prosecutor and, shortly after his father’s suicide, married Landra Gould, the daughter of Jewish immigrants. He soon became involved in Democratic politics, first in Henderson and then statewide. By 1968 he was a member of the state assembly and in 1970 was asked by his high school mentor, O’Callaghan, to run with him. O’Callaghan was elected governor of the state and Reid became his lieutenant governor. In 1974 he ran for the Senate, but was narrowly beaten by Ronald Reagan’s friend Paul Laxalt. In 1975 he stood, again unsuccessfully, for mayor of Las Vegas, a city dominated by gambling, tourism and entertainment. From 1977 to 1981 he was chair of the Nevada Gaming Commission, a job that was to be the making of him. When he was offered a bribe of $12,000 by Jack Gordon, the Las Vegas gambling and prostitution operator, Reid tipped off the FBI. At the moment when Gordon produced the money, FBI agents rushed in; he was sentenced to six months in prison. In 1981, a bomb was found under Reid’s car, which he always blamed on Gordon’s heavies. After that, the more respectable elements of the US gambling industry supported Reid, although his opponents repeatedly tried to tar him with suggestions of ethical violations. In 1982 he was elected to the House of Representatives from the Las Vegas district, and served there until 1986, when he entered the Senate for the first time. He was re-elected easily in 1992, but six years later was nearly beaten in a high-spending campaign that his Republican opponent, John Ensign, a man with casino connections, freely conceded was “nasty”. Nonetheless, Reid and Ensign eventually became good friends as Nevada’s two senators. By 2004, when Reid’s time for re-election came around again, Nevada’s population had grown so fast that many of his constituents had never heard of their senior senator. So Reid raised a lot of money for a campaign to make himself known. He became the leader of the Democratic minority in the Senate in 2005 after Tom Daschle failed to be re-elected, and after the 2006 election – when the Democrats benefited from the unpopularity of the Iraq war and the mishandling of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina – he was confirmed as the Democrats’ majority leader, serving in that role until 2015. He retired from the Senate as minority leader by not seeking re-election in 2016, following injuries in an accident with exercise equipment in his home. In 2018 he revealed that he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Reid was known in Washington for his terse manner. In a tribute to him in 2019, Obama joked: “Even when I was president, he would hang up on me.” Shortly before his death, Las Vegas’s airport was renamed after him. Reid is survived by Landra and by their four sons and one daughter.

12/31/2021,"As people across the UK prepare to ring in the new year, one thing that will be missing for many is a Covid lateral flow test. Town-centre pharmacies’ stocks have been wiped out as people seek assurance before attending parties or meeting vulnerable relatives.  While it’s not unusual for shopping centres to be busy between Christmas and new year, with shoppers hitting the sales and enjoying festive markets, the most sought-after products are proving to be the tests. On Thursday the Guardian visited four chemists in Kingston upon Thames, a busy shopping hub in south-west London, and found that three were out of stock and the fourth had one kit left. Staff advised customers to come back tomorrow, with test kits also unavailable to order online. The NHS website allows users to search for tests by postcode but none of the recommended pharmacies in Kingston upon Thames had any in stock. Boxes of 20 LFTs were available at a council-run testing facility. Some shoppers told the Guardian it was the only place they had been able to pick up tests. “I’ve tried three different pharmacies in the high street where I live over the past couple of weeks and they’ve been all out,” said Sally Arnold, from Surbiton. “It’s also going to be make it tricky for people going back to work if you can’t get hold of them, as we have to go in to the office.” Her friend Lisa Sanders, also from Surbiton, said: “I ordered some about a week ago and I’m still waiting for them to be delivered – every time I look on the app it says ‘sorry, no deliveries’. “I think people are trying to be responsible and to do the right thing but if you can’t get hold of tests then what can you do? I was lucky, I saw my sister over Christmas in a different part of the country and she is able to get them and gave me a box, but you just can’t get them anywhere round here.” A member of staff at the facility, who wished to remain anonymous, said LFTs had been available at the testing site throughout the year but footfall had “shot up” since the Omicron variant led to a sharp rise in recorded cases. Ministers have been urging people to test before socialising, and the surge in demand has outstripped supply. Beverley Bairstow, from Kingston, said she had come straight to the council facility after hearing about shortages at pharmacies closer to where she lives. She said: “I didn’t even bother trying anywhere else because I heard they haven’t got them. We try to keep some in the house but now we have run out and were told our local chemist doesn’t have any left. We did also try online but there weren’t any available either. When we saw there were some here, we thought: great, at last.” Francesca Rowland said she had stocked up on tests for friends and family as well as herself. “I haven’t been able to get any tests before today, and because I work in a school I need to be doing them every day,” she said. “It’s not been easy because we can’t order online now, but luckily I knew this was here.” Lutz Amechi, from Kingston, said: “My belief is the only way we will get through this is constant, frequent testing, so we test every second day at home.”",News/World news,‘People are trying to be responsible’ – but there are no lateral flow tests,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/people-are-trying-to-be-responsible-but-there-are-no-lateral-flow-tests
12/31/2021,"In the battle with Covid, the year 2021 has turned out to be a reality check. Misleading claims at the start of the pandemic in 2020 that lockdowns would suffice to “send coronavirus packing” were replaced, at the start of the year, by another simplistic conceit that vaccinations would accomplish the same goal, enabling economic activity and social life to resume at full power. It has not turned out that way. An evolving and sometimes stop-start combination of national restrictions, individual behaviours and repeat vaccinations has kept the worst ravages under some control. Yet the spike in Omicron cases and this week’s preparation for new hospitalisations show that the crisis is very finely balanced. As we bid farewell to the old year on Friday, it ought to be clear to all but the most dogmatic ideologues that 2022 will not be a shining new virus-free era. It will be another volatile mixture, not quite the same as 2021, but not so very different either.  Boris Johnson always shies away from this truth. He dislikes giving bad news even when he is popular, and especially when he is not, as at present. He pretends that simple solutions are just around the corner, even when, as now, he can no longer count on his own party’s support to implement them. That is why he has bet the farm on simply getting through the Christmas and new year season with a combination of modest and potentially contradictory policies but without bringing the NHS to its knees. He tells the public to party on, but at the same time to take regular tests; to act responsibly, but to splash the cash in bars; to observe private rules, but to spurn public ones. The essence of his policy is to cross his fingers and hope something turns up. It is desperately cynical. Mr Johnson does all this because he has lost his authority over Conservative MPs and the country. Lockdown and social distancing options are now closed off to him by the right wing of the Tory party. The vaccines route may soon become almost as prohibitive, because his party will oppose the necessary measures to incentivise the unvaccinated minority to comply. The reality is that Mr Johnson is more than ever reliant on the decency of others. If England comes through the holiday period infection spike, it will be thanks to the public, not to the prime minister. Just as he did earlier on in the pandemic, Mr Johnson has launched his latest policy with another airy promise that he knows he cannot keep. In times gone by he promised a world-beating contact tracing system by June 2020; it never happened. A month ago, to combat Omicron, he committed to a million booster jabs a day by this weekend; the target has never been met. Before the holidays, he said that people should take a test and socialise; all too often, those tests are simply unavailable. He is taking a tremendous risk. Mr Johnson is not alone in trying to balance public health caution with respect for the public’s frustrations and fatigue. Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland, Mark Drakeford in Wales and Paul Givan in Northern Ireland are navigating these same issues. None have got everything right, and although the temptation to inflate small differences for political advantage is ever present – as Emmanuel Macron is also showing – most of the UK national governments are in approximately the same place on Covid because their publics are too. As 2022 dawns, the reality that we all remain in this together should guide them all.",Opinion/Opinion,"The Guardian view on Covid in 2022: new year, old pandemic | Editorial",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/30/the-guardian-view-on-covid-in-2022-new-year-old-pandemic
12/31/2021,"By the end of this year, the United Nations warned recently, 377,000 Yemenis will have died from seven devastating years of war – in many cases killed by indirect causes such as hunger; in others, by airstrikes or missile bombardments. Seventy per cent of the fatalities are thought to be children under five. As 2021 began, there were hopes that Joe Biden’s arrival in the White House might bring progress towards peace. His administration quickly announced it was ending all support for offensive operations by Saudi Arabia, which spearheaded the US- and UK-backed coalition fighting for the internationally recognised government overthrown by Houthi rebels. It also revoked the Trump administration’s designation of the Houthis as a terrorist group. But Mr Biden’s team overestimated its ability to help resolve the crisis. The diplomatic push soon faltered. In October, Washington announced a $500m military contract with Riyadh which includes support for its attack helicopters, used in operations in Yemen.  Meanwhile, a humanitarian catastrophe that the UN has described as the worst in the world is deepening. Just before Christmas, the World Food Programme said that it had been forced to cut aid due to insufficient funds, three months after it warned that 16 million Yemenis were “marching towards starvation”. Four million people are displaced. This was the poorest country in the region even before the war broke out, with 47% of the population living in poverty. The UN has since warned that it is on course to become the poorest in the world, with 71%-78% of Yemenis now below the poverty line. Already inadequate infrastructure and services have been devastated, with schools and hospitals targeted. Both sides have shown a ruthless contempt for civilians. The UN special envoy Hans Grundberg warns that the recent escalation is among the worst in the conflict. The Iran-backed Houthis have intensified their offensive on Marib, the last major stronghold of the government that they ousted, stalling talks. Coalition airstrikes on the airport at the capital Sana’a, held by the Houthis, halted aid flights this month, although rebels now say they can resume on a “temporary” basis. The war has become increasingly complex as the secessionist Southern Transition Council along with al-Qaida and Islamic State cells have seized their opportunity. But above all, it has been supercharged by the regional rivalry between Riyadh and Tehran. As one young Yemeni observed: “We are just a battlefield.” Saudi Arabia, which expected a quick win, has little to show for the billions that it has poured into this war. Though its ally, the UAE, withdrew most troops two years ago, Riyadh is still in search of an exit. That it is talking to Iran, after they cut ties in 2016, is a significant advance. But the two sides have very different reasons for engaging, and the lives of Yemenis are low in either’s priorities – many suspect that the Houthis hope to derail the talks, believing that a military victory is within their grasp. They have sharply increased missile and drone attacks on Saudi targets. With borders and airspace sealed, the world has largely been able to ignore the war’s impact on Yemen’s civilians. But the conflict must not be allowed to slip down the agenda again. Its grim and entrenched nature is not cause to give up on diplomacy, but all the more reason to renew the determined efforts required if Yemenis are to have a real future.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Yemen: the forgotten war | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/30/the-guardian-view-on-yemen-the-forgotten-war
12/31/2021,"Germany’s health minister has said he is in favour of modifying quarantine rules to cope with a new wave of coronavirus caused by the Omicron variant, which is already dominant in some parts of the country. Anyone infected with Omicron is required to quarantine for 14 days, and the same applies to their contacts, even if triple vaccinated. Some experts have suggested reducing the quarantine length to five days for people who show no symptoms and return a negative test result. England and Spain have shortened their quarantine times from 10 to seven days, and the US to five.  Omicron accounted for about 17,000 out of Germany’s almost 43,000 new confirmed cases on Thursday. The health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said the real infection rate was likely to be around two to three times higher owing to under-reporting and a lack of laboratory testing during the Christmas period, and he expected the confirmed daily figures to double within four or five days. There are fears that if many thousands of people are infected, the health system and other essential services such as policing, firefighting, schools and rubbish collection could grind to a halt. Contingency plans are in place under which the army and the technical emergency agency, the THW, would take over vital infrastructure roles. Since entering office this month Lauterbach has frequently acknowledged taking steers from experts in the UK owing to the more advanced spread of Omicron there. He said the German government’s expert council – a group including virologists, psychologists and sociologists – was working on a plan to adjust the length of quarantine required. The Omicron surge is strongest in the north of the country, in particular areas such as Bremen, Hamburg, Schleswig Holstein and North Rhine Westphalia. The Netherlands and Denmark are also experiencing high Omicron rates. With schools in Germany due to return on 3 January after the Christmas break, there have been calls for the holidays to be extended. Education ministers have called a meeting for 5 January, and the government and leaders of the 16 states are due to hold their next decision-making round on protection measures two days later. Experts have suggested decisions on school openings should be based on regional infection rates so as to cause the least disruption possible. The eastern state of Thuringia, where infections are among the highest in the country, has said school holidays will initially be extended for two days. Karin Prien, the head of the conference of education ministers, said the aim should be to keep schools open owing to the psychological and social burdens of home schooling. “The schools should be the last area to have to once again face blanket closure,” she said. Just over 71% of people in Germany are fully vaccinated, while 17.5 million people – not including the 4 million under-fives – are without any protection. A booster campaign has so far reached 38% of the population.",News/World news,Germany may follow England in cutting isolation time as Omicron spreads,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/germany-may-follow-england-in-cutting-isolation-time-as-omicron-spreads

Police were working on the theory that she might have travelled to north Devon where she has family connections.  But she was found at an address in Boston, and a 34-year-old man originally from Devon has been arrested on suspicion of child abduction and kidnap.

He is due to be transferred into police custody within Devon and Cornwall for questioning in due course. Officers would like to thank the public for their support.” The police made several appeals for information about Leona and called on her to get in touch if she could.

12/31/2021,"Ghislaine Maxwell is going to jail, and for a very long time indeed. Prince Andrew’s good friend of many decades, and Donald Trump’s regular guest at his Florida retreat, has been convicted of grooming and trafficking girls for sex in a verdict that will reverberate through the highest reaches of the transatlantic establishment. No more invites to Balmoral for the woman who turned vulnerable teenagers into rich men’s sexual playthings, and no more hobnobbing with friendly newspaper editors either. No more private jets or haughty instructions to staff to keep their mouths shut, even as they were picking up discarded vibrators from the bedroom floor. And presumably no more public sympathy of the kind Rachel Johnson expressed recently in the Spectator, fondly recalling Ghislaine’s “naughty eyes” as she flirted with a young Boris Johnson at Oxford, back in the days when none of them had ever heard of the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. For all that Maxwell’s lawyers sought to paint her accusers as gold-diggers chasing damages from Epstein’s estate, the lesson many will draw from this case is that the rich are far more often protected by their money and connections than rendered vulnerable by them. Well, now the world can finally see the seedy billionaire and his predatory girlfriend for what they were. Much like the guilty verdict handed to Harvey Weinstein almost two years ago, the result goes some way to restoring faith in the battered principle that nobody should be above the law. Yet there’s something profoundly unsatisfying about it nonetheless. That the woman who procured girls for Epstein and his wealthy friends will now die in prison, while the men involved remain either free to live their lives or (in Epstein’s case) beyond the reach of any mortal judge, provokes a nagging sense of unfinished business.  It goes without saying that Ghislaine Maxwell is not the victim here. Although her lawyers made much of the fact that Epstein’s prison suicide left her to carry the can for his crimes, suggesting rage at him had been unfairly projected on to her, the prosecution argued more convincingly that she was in fact critical to the enterprise. A lone middle-aged man asking teenage girls to visit his ranch is creepy, but the same invitation from a couple feels respectable, even benevolent. From an early age, we drum into children the idea that if they’re lost or scared they should seek help from a police officer first and, failing that, a woman. The girls Maxwell lured into her boyfriend’s clutches were reassured by an older woman’s presence and it’s the betrayal of that female trust that feels so monstrous. While these vulnerable teenagers looked to her for support, she was grooming them for sexual exploitation, normalising the perverted anything-goes culture inside his mansion. Strip away the yachts and the servants and all the other trappings of a billionaire lifestyle, and there is frighteningly little separating Maxwell from that tiny but grotesque pantheon of female offenders seemingly so desperate to be loved that they collude in their partners’ abusive fantasies, even to the point of helping persuade someone else’s daughter into a car. We may never know whether Maxwell got her own kicks from this twisted game or whether she was simply too damaged to resist it, conditioned perhaps as friends have suggested by a childhood in the shadow of her bullying father, the late tycoon Robert Maxwell. But the “poor little rich girl” thesis sits uneasily with some of the stories her accusers told in court, which imply a woman accustomed to dealing with problems as only the rich can: by paying someone to make them go away. Kate, who was 17 when she first met the couple, recalled Maxwell complaining about Epstein’s voracious sexual appetite and asking “if I knew anybody who could come and give Jeffrey a blowjob because it was a lot for her to do”, much as she might seek recommendations for a butler or a pool boy – except in this case it was imperative they be young. Carolyn, who was 14 when she was first paid to give Epstein one of his infamously sexualised massages, described how Maxwell felt her breasts and bottom much as if she were checking over livestock for sale, and concluded she had a “great body for Mr Epstein and his friends”. And it’s on those nameless “friends” that the spotlight must now fall. First and most obviously in the firing line are the men against whom direct allegations have been made, chief among them Prince Andrew. Virginia Giuffre, who is currently attempting to bring a civil suit against the prince accusing him of a sexual assault he has vehemently and repeatedly denied, can only be encouraged by a verdict she welcomed with a pointed tweet, arguing that “Maxwell did not act alone. Others must be held accountable.” Whether her lawsuit succeeds or fails, however, the unmasking of his good friend Ghislaine as a convicted sex trafficker makes it almost impossible to envisage a way back to royal ribbon-cutting duties for the prince. But there are plenty more high-profile men who flew on Epstein’s planes, enjoyed his lavish parties, even stayed overnight in one of those mansions hung with tacky erotic art, and say they saw nothing amiss. Was he simply so discreet that nobody could possibly have suspected a thing? Or could it be that a predilection for teenage girls simply didn’t seem all that shocking, inside a rich man’s world where trading in an ageing first wife for someone barely older than your daughter is no big deal? Meanwhile, in the US, there are disturbing questions to answer about a long, oddly flat-footed investigation into Epstein that left victims fearing they would never get their day in court and conspiracy theorists emerging to fill a judicial vacuum. That Maxwell held her tongue even when she eventually came to trial, refusing to testify in her own defence in a way that meant she could be asked no incriminating questions about the household names peppering the victims’ testimony, has only encouraged the latter. Some still hope she might share whatever she knows now, given the conviction has left her with nothing much to lose. The family’s decision to appeal makes that unlikely at least in the near future, and it remains to be seen whether a woman who has traded on her connections all her life is capable even now of turning on them. But she cannot be the only one who knows more than she is telling about that tainted circle through which so many powerful men have moved. Justice is surely neither done, nor seen to be done, until all their dirty little secrets are out.

Insufficient nurses try to cope, but mouth hygiene is neglected. And no shower or hair wash for more than a month. He deserves better. Hardly God’s waiting room, more like death row.

I wonder if this stage in public sentiment was envisaged or even engineered as part of a transition to a system of private healthcare. For almost two years we have been bludgeoned with the command to protect the NHS. But protecting the NHS is not primarily our responsibility – it’s the government’s. There’s nothing inevitable about the NHS having to struggle along on inadequate resources while its staff compensate for the deficit with heroic amounts of goodwill.Susan TomesEdinburgh  In the past four months, three friends of mine, all ardent believers in the NHS, have swallowed their principles and paid for private operations to avoid a wait of up to two years for surgery that would restore their quality of life. They have no doubts about the quality of care provided by the NHS, but its underresourcing means that long waits for non-urgent interventions have become painfully inevitable. With a heavy heart, I fear that I would do the same in their position. This is what 11 years of underfunding has come to.

12/31/2021,"Simon Hattenstone’s article (I didn’t want anyone else to look after Mum – until I realised what she wanted, 27 December) almost exactly mirrors my mother’s story. Aged 94, frail but still living independently in a small cottage in London, she fell in late November and spent much of one night on the floor, in pain and disorientated. Hospital followed for one week at St George’s, Tooting. There she received the most amazing care with the doctors, nurses and auxiliary staff all meeting my expectations of the amazing NHS at its very best, even during these trying times. But it was evident that she couldn’t return to her house alone. Luck struck. A close friend had recently died and her carer was available to move in with my mother. Outcome? An elderly woman who seems more contented and at ease than previously, perhaps because the worry of living alone at a great age has now been taken away. She has support, friendship and the most amazing care, and she’s still “at home” – that being her greatest desire of all.  But here’s the bit that Hattenstone’s article doesn’t address: money. In my mother’s case, and I’m assuming in Hattenstone’s too, there is sufficient family income to cover the costs of a live-in carer. For most this simply wouldn’t be an option. Until a system is devised, and funded, that would offer all people dignity and independence in old age, we can’t rest easy. It’s so good that Hattenstone’s mother and my mother are now thankfully content and well cared for, but that should, in a civilised society, be the lot of all older people. It clearly isn’t now.Jol MiskinSheffield  Simon Hattenstone’s article was an excellent sharp focus on the importance of listening to those in need of care. A good carer can give independence, reassurance, dignity and friendship, and even the most of complicated of houses can be adapted if someone wants to stay in their own home.

New Beacon played a crucial role in supplying Caribbean, African and Indian fiction to schools such as Clissold Park comprehensive in Stoke Newington, where I was lucky enough to teach English. The head of English, Joan Goody, made sure that we young teachers visited the shop, read the books, met the authors and participated in multicultural events, and that pupils had access to fiction from their own and worldwide postcolonial backgrounds. The partnership of bookshop – really a cultural centre – and school was symbiotic and very exciting.

12/31/2021,"Now that the British former socialite Ghislaine Maxwell has been convicted in her sex-trafficking trial, speculation is growing that she may try to cut a deal and become a government witness in any broader investigation into the elite social circle of her ex-boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein.  Maxwell would be aiming for a reduced sentence by naming powerful names when it comes to others who may be involved in Epstein’s crimes. But defense lawyers and sexual-crimes prosecutors have cast doubt on the government’s appetite to strike a bargain. They question whether Maxwell has any vital information the government does not already have, and whether it represents a strategy Maxwell has previously attempted that has failed. “It all depends on who she would be cooperating against, and what she has to offer,” said Jeffrey Lichtman, the defense attorney who represented the Mexican drug trafficker Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán at trial two years ago. “I would not be surprised if she had already tried to cooperate and it had failed.” Maxwell, who is expected to appeal her conviction, was found guilty on five of six charges for her involvement in Epstein’s sexual abuse of teenage girls. Prosecutors said Maxwell “preyed on vulnerable young girls, manipulated them and served them up to be sexually abused”. She is expected to receive a significant prison term. According to Lichtman, there are defendants who, in the eyes of the government, are so bad that it does not want to strike a deal in exchange for testimony. “They don’t want to take the hand of someone involved a criminal operation and let them cooperate against people who are well below them.” “That may be the case here – they just feel that she’s so bad they won’t allow her to cooperate,” Lichtman said. But that does not preclude Maxwell and her lawyers from making an offer. “There’s a tremendous amount of information she has on some very important people. Now that she’s been convicted she may be more eager to discuss. She certainly should, in my mind, because a lot of people skated here, while she bore the brunt of the government’s full wrath,” Lichtman said. Former federal and state prosecutor Elie Honig said on Twitter: “Maxwell’s cooperation is not particularly likely, but it is possible. You’d need (1) Maxwell to be willing and fully on board, (2) SDNY to be fully convinced of her truthfulness, and (3) a realistic plan to use her information versus others.” One obstacle to any state prosecution based on Maxwell’s cooperation would be the statute of limitations on criminal and civil sexual crime complaints. The civil case bought by Virginia Giuffre against Britain’s Prince Andrew only exists because of a briefly opened window under the New York Child Victims Act, which allowed accusers to sue beyond the statute of limitations. But there is also pressure for high-profile visitors to Epstein’s properties in New York, Palm Beach and the the US Virgin Islands to be held accountable for any potential crimes, particularly as the government’s case against Maxwell appeared to avoid reference to broader aspects of the conspiracy. “Of all the people supposedly involved with Epstein, 99% of them never made it into the government’s evidence,” said Lichtman. “Perhaps they were trying to avoid any frolic by the jury – that they’d get distracted by the bold-face names – but many people didn’t get prosecuted here when it seems like they could have,” he added. According to Wendy Murphy, a former federal sex crimes prosecutor who now teaches at Boston Law, the relative absence of Epstein from Maxwell’s conspiracy trial was part of the government’s strategy. “They didn’t need more to prove conspiracy,” she said. “They didn’t need to overdo it. There was some weakness in the victims testimony but it was more than offset by other evidence.” The next chapter of the Epstein case, Murphy said, is likely to come through the civil action against Prince Andrew. “Prince Andrew may be the next shoe to drop, and it may be the only shoe,” she said. The windows have closed on lawsuits for the most part, and I don’t know of another lawsuit with the potential to expose information.” But if more investigations do happen, Murphy said Maxwell could get time off her sentence if the government wants important information she has. “I’m not sure the feds are asking and I’m not sure she’s willing to give. She’s probably not going to say anything, and they don’t need her to, because they already have a lot of information. If they don’t need anything, they’re not going to give her a discount.” Ultimately, said Bennett Gershman, professor of law at Pace University in New York, much depends on whether the government feels there is political mileage in continuing the investigation and identifying high-profile people who may have been part of the scheme. “It’s hard to say what the government is interested in further on. We can’t answer that. Are the victims and people who really care about this case satisfied now Maxwell has been convicted or do they want to see other people in the larger network investigated?” He added: “They have limited resources and personnel, so does this case cry out for further investigation and prosecution? That’s a political decision by the US department of justice and the US attorney’s office.”",News/US news,Speculation grows that Maxwell may try to cut a deal for reduced sentence,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/30/ghislaine-maxwell-sentence-deal-speculation-jeffrey-epstein

12/31/2021,"A coroner will investigate the deaths of two women from herpes following childbirth, amid fears they contracted the virus from their surgeon. Kim Sampson, 29, and Samantha Mulcahy, 32, died weeks apart after their babies were delivered by caesarean section at different hospitals in Kent.  Their families have campaigned for answers as to whether they contracted the infection from their surgeon, after a BBC investigation found the women were treated by the same person. The inquests have been listed to open and adjourn in Maidstone on 4 January, with a pre-inquest review the following month and full inquests at a later date. Sampson’s mother, Yvette, said: “We’ve wanted this since Kim died in 2018 – it’s been a long time coming. We hope we are finally going to get answers to the questions we’ve always had – both for ourselves and for Kim’s children.” Herpes infections are commonly found in the genitals and on the face, often with mild symptoms. Sampson’s baby boy, her second child, was delivered at Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital in Margate in May 2018, but she died at the end of the month in hospital in London after becoming infected. In July the same year, first-time mother Mulcahy died from an infection caused by the virus at William Harvey hospital in Ashford. Dr Rebecca Martin, chief medical officer for East Kent hospitals, said: “Our deepest sympathies are with the families and friends of Kimberley and Samantha. “We will do everything possible to support these inquests and our thoughts are with Kimberley and Samantha’s families at this time.” A coroner had previously ruled out inquests into their deaths but now this decision has been reversed. The families had initially received a letter from coroner Katrina Hepburn saying there would not be an inquest for either case, acknowledging the similarities but saying there was “no connection”. Sampson had a good pregnancy but struggled with the birth and she kept saying the baby was stuck, her mother said. Doctors performed a C-section to deliver her son and Sampson needed a blood transfusion after injuries sustained in the operation. She was rushed back to hospital following discharge after the operation as doctors believed she had bacterial sepsis. She was given antibiotics, but her condition worsened. Mulcahy went into labour four weeks ahead of her due date. Her hospital was part of the same trust as that where Sampson was treated. She had 17 hours of contractions and was taken for a C-section after some worrying blood test results. After giving birth, Mulcahy was kept in for observation. She became increasingly unwell, and doctors also thought she had bacterial sepsis. She spent four days in intensive care, where a doctor suggested antiviral medication, but the microbiology department advised them to continue with antibiotics. Mulcahy died from multi-organ failure following a “disseminated herpes simplex type 1 infection”, a postmortem found. Both women had a “primary infection” which means that this was the first time they had contracted the virus and neither of their children were found to have it. Sampson’s family requested documents from Public Health England which revealed emails from the trust, some NHS bodies, staff at PHE, and a private lab. The messages showed that the same two clinicians – a midwife and the surgeon who carried out the C-sections – had been involved in both births.",News/UK news,Inquests to be held into deaths of new mothers who died from herpes,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/30/inquests-to-be-held-into-deaths-of-new-mothers-who-died-from-herpes
12/31/2021,"Hospitality bosses have urged consumers not to desert their local pub during “dry January”, the month when many people abstain from alcohol, as hard-hit venues struggle to recover from a nightmare Christmas. Takings over the crucial festive weeks have fallen by as much as 60% compared with the same period in 2019, making this the second year in a row that pubs, bars and restaurants have lost out during the most lucrative time of the year.  The slump means venues have not built up the cash reserves they need to survive the typically quiet January and February, piling pressure on a sector already reeling from pandemic-related losses and ballooning rent debts. Several leading figures in the hospitality industry told the Guardian that pubs would fall into even greater financial difficulty unless people kept visitingthem during January, the annual month when some people choose to stop drinking. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of the trade body UK Hospitality, said: “I think we could definitely dispense with it [dry January].” She called on people who are trying to avoid alcohol to consider choosing something else at the bar or going out for food. “This year, there are an awful lot more non-alcoholic options available that are really good quality, so there’s no excuse not to go out and support your local hospitality business.” Greg Mulholland, the Campaign for Pubs director, said: “Pubs and publicans will need support throughout January and we’d urge people to continue to go to the pub. “The pub is about so much more than having a drink, so we hope people recognise the important role pubs play in our communities and get out and support them, whatever they choose to drink and eat.” He also stressed the improved availability of non-alcoholic options in the UK’s network of pubs, the number of which has been in decline in recent years and currently stands at about 47,000. Concern about alcohol intake has increased during the pandemic, following a Public Health England report that detailed a rise in problem-drinking deaths associated with successive lockdowns. However, the report found that the steepest rise in alcohol sales came from people drinking at home during lockdowns that forced hospitality venues to close. Paul Crossman, who runs three pubs in York including The Swan, said it was still possible for people to order at the bar without compromising their health goals. “It would be much appreciated if people did forego dry January, but loads of us have really good alcohol-free options too. It’s about supporting local hospitality businesses so that they can get through it,” he said. The pub group Fuller’s was forced to close several venues earlier this month as a result of slow trade, partly because its portfolio of more than 380 pubs and inns is weighted towards London, where cases of the Omicron Covid variant have soared and work-from-home guidance has left parts of the city deserted. The chief executive of Fuller’s, Simon Emeny, said he hoped there would be “enormous pent-up demand” after people sacrificed pre-Christmas nights out to ensure they could still see family. He pointed out that while the aims of dry January, promoted by Alcohol Change UK, are laudable, there is conflicting opinion about whether it’s the right approach to counteracting overindulgence. “Medical evidence says that drinking in moderation is more sensible than abstaining for an entire month,” Emeny said. “I do think that having been denied the opportunity to mix and socialise, a lot of people will say they’ll make up for lost time and be more sociable in January.” While many pubs fear a downturn in January partly due to people choosing not to drink Peter Marks, who runs the UK’s largest bar and nightclub business Rekom UK, said young people were less likely to abstain. “They’ll take a couple of weekends for their wallet to recover from Christmas and New Year, but as long as students come back in that third week of January, we never see any effect from dry January,” he said.",News/Business,"Keep going to pubs during dry January, UK hospitality bosses urge",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/30/pubs-dry-january-uk-hospitality-alcohol-christmas
12/31/2021,"The health secretary, Sajid Javid, is being urged to ensure NHS workers are prioritised for Covid tests or risk a “devastating” impact on patient care, after conceding to MPs that the supply of lateral flow kits would have to be “constrained” over the next fortnight in light of rocketing demand. The British Medical Association (BMA), which represents doctors, warned that the system for ensuring NHS staff receive tests was “not working”. It said its members were reporting problems with obtaining PCR and lateral flow tests, despite healthcare workers supposedly being given priority for both.  The BMA’s chair of council, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said: “Being unable to get the tests means staff may not be legally allowed to work and, at a time of acute workforce shortages and winter pressures, this could be devastating for the care that can be given right across the NHS.” Demand for tests has been surging in recent days, with new infections increasing rapidly and ministers, including the prime minister, Boris Johnson, advising the public to test themselves before attending New Year’s Eve parties or meeting vulnerable relatives. Another factor boosting demand is that the self-isolation period in England was recently cut from 10 days to seven, but only with two negative lateral flow tests. Official figures showed that 189,213 new cases were reported in the UK in the 24 hours to 9am on Thursday, and 332 people died within 28 days of a positive Covid test although this included hospital death figures from England since 24 December. NHS statistics showed 11,452 people in England were in hospital with Covid-19 as of the morning of December 30, up 61% in a week – and the highest number since 26 February. Javid has acknowledged in a letter to MPs that the supply of lateral flow tests may have to be constrained over the next fortnight. “In light of the huge demand for LFDs [lateral flow devices] seen over the last three weeks, we expect to need to constrain the system at certain points over the next two weeks to manage supply over the course of each day, with new tranches of supply released regularly throughout each day,” he wrote on Wednesday night. The shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, has written to Javid calling on him to make sure healthcare workers are given priority. “I urge you to put the key workers we have relied upon for the past two years to the front of the queue and do everything you can to prevent a staffing shortage crisis in our NHS. The government must get a grip on this crisis, bring these shortages to an end, and ensure everyone can access tests quickly and regularly,” he wrote. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson rejected the idea that healthcare workers had been unable to obtain tests, saying they had their own dedicated supply channel. Azeem Majeed, a professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, said the government was “in part to blame” for the shortage of tests because of its advice to the public to test themselves before social events and outings. “It has become very clear that there are nowhere nearly enough lateral flow tests for Covid-19 in England to allow the government’s policy of their indiscriminate use,” he said in an article in the Guardian. He called for the publication of daily data on how many tests are available, and then “clear guidance from the government on what groups should be prioritised for testing and how frequently they should test”. The Welsh government announced on Thursday that it had lent an additional 4m lateral flow testing kits to England to help alleviate the supply squeeze across the border, bringing the total offered to 10m. The National Education Union (NEU) has called for teachers to be among the groups given priority, amid concerns about whether sufficient tests will available as the new term starts next week. Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the NEU, said: “If schools are the top priority, as Boris Johnson has said they are, there is a case for teachers being a priority group so that they can test themselves, so they can be in school educating pupils.” With all secondary pupils expected to be tested before they start the spring term next week, the Liberal Democrats have urged the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, to ensure every school has enough tests in place. The Lib Dem education spokesperson, Munira Wilson, said: “Nadhim Zahawi must provide a cast-iron guarantee that every child and teacher who needs a Covid test will be able to access one on the first day of term, to avoid yet more disruption to schools next week. We cannot afford a repeat of last year’s fiasco when pupils returned for one day before being sent home again.” A Department for Education spokesperson said the government had delivered 28m test kits to schools in the final two weeks of last term. “Schools and colleges use a different priority supply route to get their lateral flow tests. Most kits have already been received for the start of the new term and we have emergency arrangements in place to make sure every school has the testing it needs,” the spokesperson said. One south London headteacher, Ben Roberts, of Heathbrook primary school in Lambeth, said his school had ordered tests from the DfE two weeks before the end of term and was yet to receive them. He said he had been touring local pharmacies trying to obtain test kits. “We were expecting staff to go in for an inset day on Tuesday. If staff haven’t had a test prior to that, all we’re doing is super-spreading again. So I for the last few days have been trying every which way to get hold of any more.” The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee (PSNC), which represents NHS community pharmacies in England, said some pharmacy staff were being verbally abused when stocks of lateral flow tests ran out. Alastair Buxton, the PSNC’s director of NHS services, said: “Public demand for test kits remains exceptionally high and, despite UKHSA delivering some 2m tests to pharmacy wholesalers on some days, this is still falling short of demand. Members of the public being directed to pharmacies for tests are rightly frustrated when they cannot get them, but it’s concerning that some pharmacy teams say they are still being verbally abused when this happens.” A government spokesperson said: “The NHS has additional stock of lateral flow tests and those who live or work in vulnerable settings have access to dedicated testing order routes. If at some point it is necessary to do so we will always prioritise protecting the most vulnerable as well as critical workforces, as we have done throughout the pandemic when it comes to vaccines, boosters, testing and other infection control measures such as PPE.”",News/World news,Javid urged to prioritise Covid tests for NHS workers or risk patient harm,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/javid-urged-to-prioritise-covid-tests-for-nhs-workers-or-risk-patient-harm
12/31/2021,"The legendary British sprinter Ron Jones, who captained Team GB at the Mexico Olympics in 1968 and was part of the 4x110yd team that equalled the world record in 1963, has died at the age of 87. After his illustrious track and field career, Jones moved into football, first as the chief executive of QPR in 1976 before becoming managing director at Cardiff and then Portsmouth.  But he will be best remembered for being part of the British team – alongside Peter Radford, David Jones and Berwyn Jones – who stunned a strong US contingent to equal the world 4x110yd record in 40.0 secs. Writing in the Observer, Norris McWhirter said the performance was so good it made “the White City crowd explode with joy – just like in the old days”. The feat was even more impressive given the US team that day included Bob “The Bullet” Hayes, the world’s fastest man who would later win gold at the 1964 Olympics. It was a measure of Jones’s quality that when he faced Hayes in the individual 100yd dash earlier that afternoon he pushed him to the line. “The mighty Hayes, who breaks all the rules of fast movement by rocking and rolling as he fights his pigeon-toed way down the track, was expected to pull away,” wrote McWhirter. “But nothing of the sort happened. In fact Jones fractionally closed on him and was only beaten by two foot on the tape.” Hayes’s time was 9.5s, with Jones’s 9.6s. Such was Jones’s form that year he also set a Welsh 100m record of 10.30s – which stood for 27 years until it was beaten by Colin Jackson in 1990. His great friend Lynn Davies, who won long jump gold in Tokyo 1964 and ran in the GB relay team with Jones in those Olympics, told the Guardian that Jones was an “inspirational character on and off the track”. “Ron will be remembered for being one of Wales’s greatest ever athletes,” he said. “He was one of my heroes growing up and when we raced I could never beat him. He had such a smooth stride. And, remarkably, he did it all while working full-time as an accountant.” Davies said that, when Jones was managing director at Cardiff City, he would even take fitness training with the players. “And he also did a great deal for young people in sport in Wales as chairman of Sports Aid Cymru Wales.” “He was a very proud Welshman with a very warm and outgoing personality,” he added. “He loved company, and a glass of red wine. I have many happy memories of sitting with him and reminiscing about the good old days.”",Sport/Sport,"Ron Jones, sprinter and British captain at Mexico Olympics, dies aged 87",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/30/ron-jones-sprinter-and-british-captain-at-mexico-olympics-dies-aged-87
