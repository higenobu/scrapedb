1/19/2022,"A California woman said she would ""definitely eat sushi again” even after suffering from a severe stomachache the day after binge-eating 32 all-you-can-eat sushi rolls, among other dishes.

Danielle Shapiro, 24, shared what happened in a TikTok on Dec. 23, 2021 which she titled “All you can eat sushi gone wrong,” according to the New York Post. The video has already been viewed more than 11.3 million times.
 


Shapiro went to Sushi 85, a buffet restaurant in Mountain View, California, in December 2021, when her friend Amanda was visiting from out of town, LADbible reported.

“The all-you-can-eat sushi is about $50 a person so Amanda and I had to make sure we got our money's worth, which meant eating a lot,” Shapiro said. “Our dinner was about two hours long because we were so stuffed we had to keep taking breaks.”

Shapiro reportedly ate 32 sushi rolls, four gyozas, one bowl of edamame beans, two jalapeño poppers and a bowl of miso soup during their all-you-can-eat night out.

After their dinner, Shapiro said they had to sit in her car for around half an hour because of how full they felt before going home. Shapiro said she began suffering from a stomachache after arriving at her boyfriend’s house, where she spent the night. Shapiro noticed something was wrong the following day when she woke up at 6 a.m.

“My stomach and chest had intense pain, and it was hard to take deep breaths,” she said. Her boyfriend and grandmother drove her to the hospital. Shapiro was reportedly diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

GERD, a term used to describe chronic acid reflux, affects almost 20% of all Americans, according to Medical News Today. One of the most common symptoms of acid reflux is heartburn. Other symptoms include nausea or vomiting, breathing problems and difficulty or pain when swallowing.

A person who experiences three or more episodes of acid reflux in a week for a few weeks may have GERD.

Despite everything she has gone through, Shapiro declared that she “will definitely eat sushi again!”

“This experience has not ruined sushi for me, or the all-you-can-eat sushi experience,” she added. “I did learn that next time I need to listen to my body and take things slower.”

1/19/2022,"Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor has diabetes, elevating her risk for serious illness or death should she contract Covid-19. Sotomayor said recently that she doesn’t feel comfortable sitting next to unmasked justices as the highly transmissible Omicron variant surges, so Chief Justice John Roberts asked the court to wear masks. Justice Neil Gorsuch, who sits directly next to Sotomayor on the bench, refused to do so, pushing Sotomayor to do her job remotely when the court reconvened this month. More from Rolling Stone Conservative Supreme Court Justices Slap Down Biden's Employer Vaccine Mandate Why the Latest Supreme Court Ruling Is a Disaster for Abortion Rights Abortion Providers in Texas Can Sue the State, Supreme Court Says NPR reported Monday on the rift inside SCOTUS, which is currently operating under a conservative supermajority that liberal justices are worried is laying waste to precedent, particularly when it comes to abortion rights. “Will this institution survive the stench that this creates in the public perception that the Constitution and its reading are just political acts? I don’t see how it is possible,” Sotomayor said last month during arguments for a case that could set the stage for the court to overturn Roe v. Wade. It isn’t just abortion rights. The court last week blocked the Biden administration’s vaccine mandate for the nation’s largest employers. The mandate would have covered around two-thirds of the nation’s workforce. The court ruled against it, 6-3. The six votes to slap it down came from the court’s six conservative justices, who argued that Covid doesn’t represent an “occupational hazard.” Sotomayor and fellow liberals Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer released a joint dissenting opinion in which they took aim at the majority. “When we are wise, we know enough to defer on matters like this one,” they wrote. “When we are wise, we know not to displace the judgments of experts, acting within the sphere Congress marked out and under Presidential control, to deal with emergency conditions. Today, we are not wise. In the face of a still-raging pandemic, this Court tells the agency charged with protecting worker safety that it may not do so in all the workplaces needed. As disease and death continue to mount, this Court tells the agency that it cannot respond in the most effective way possible. Without legal basis, the Court usurps a decision that rightfully belongs to others. It undercuts the capacity of the responsible.” Gorsuch may not care about the health of his colleague on the court, but at least he’s consistent. He doesn’t seem to care much about the health of tens of millions of other Americans, either.

1/19/2022,"WASHINGTON — The federal government's website for Americans to order at-home rapid Covid-19 testing kits launched on Tuesday. The website says ""every home in the U.S. is eligible to order 4 free at-⁠home COVID-⁠19 tests. The tests are completely free. Orders will usually ship in 7-12 days."" ""Order your tests now so you have them when you need them,"" said the website. White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed in her press briefing that the site is currently in its ""beta phase"" ahead of the official launch on Wednesday. “Today, in alignment with website launch best practices, covidtests.gov is currently in its beta phase, which means that the website is operating at limited capacity ahead of its official launch,"" a White House official told NBC News. ""This is standard practice to address troubleshooting and ensure as smooth of an official launch tomorrow as possible. We expect the website to officially launch midmorning tomorrow.” In December, the federal government announced it would start mailing at-home Covid test kits for free to any U.S. household that requests one, as the omicron variant of the coronavirus contributes to a spike in new cases. The White House said at the time it was preparing to ship as many as 500 million kits. Testing remains one of the biggest challenges for the administration, with long lines forming at testing centers and at-home rapid tests selling out quickly, public health officials have said. Increased demand has wiped out store shelves and forced retailers to limit purchases of at-home tests. Meanwhile, increased demand for PCR testing at pharmacies, medical clinics and hospitals has led to a backlog, sometimes meaning it takes several days to get results. President Joe Biden and his top health officials last month largely focused on urging people to get vaccinations and boosters, and on wearing a mask indoors while greenlighting holiday gatherings for those fully vaccinated. The demand for testing has overwhelmed the nation's capacity in places that are hardest hit, and the administration was widely criticized recently for what appeared to be confusing recommendations for those infected. In an effort to improve its messaging Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director, said this month that she would begin holding regular news briefings with other CDC officials, apart from the weekly White House Covid briefings that typically last for 30 minutes and leave time for only a handful of questions.",Politics/NBC News,How to order free at-home Covid tests: White House website goes live,https://news.yahoo.com/order-free-covid-tests-home-182000238.html
1/19/2022,"By Kirsty Needham and Praveen Menon SYDNEY/WELLINGTON (Reuters) -All the homes on one of Tonga's small outer islands have been destroyed by a massive volcanic eruption and tsunami, with three people so far confirmed dead, the government said on Tuesday in its first update since the disaster struck. With communications https://tmsnrt.rs/3qzVPyy badly hampered by the severing of an undersea cable https://www.reuters.com/markets/funds/undersea-cable-fault-could-cut-off-tonga-rest-world-weeks-2022-01-18, information on the scale of the devastation after Saturday's eruption had so far mostly come from reconnaissance aircraft. But the office of Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni said in a statement that every home on Mango island, where around 50 people live, had been destroyed, only two houses remained on Fonoifua, and Namuka island had suffered extensive damage. Tonga’s deputy head of mission in Australia, Curtis Tu’ihalangingie, earlier said pictures taken by the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) showed ""alarming"" scenes of a village destroyed on Mango and buildings missing on Atata island, which is closer to the volcano. ""People panic, people run and get injuries. Possibly there will be more deaths and we just pray that is not the case,"" Tu’ihalangingie told Reuters. Sovaleni's office said a 65-year-old woman on Mango and a 49-year-old man on Nomuka island had been killed, in addition to the British national whose body was found on Monday. A number of injuries were also reported. Tsunami waves reaching up to 15 metres hit the Ha’apia island group, where Mango is located, and the west coast of Tonga’s main island, Tongatapu, the office said. Residents were being moved to evacuation centres as 56 houses were destroyed or seriously damaged on that coast. Atata and Mango are between about 50 km and 70 km from the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai https://graphics.reuters.com/TONGA-VOLCANO/mopanwordva/Tonga-Volcano.jpg volcano, which sent tsunami waves across the Pacific Ocean when it erupted with a blast heard 2,300 km (1,430 miles) away in New Zealand. ASH COVER Satellite images from Sunday show the caldera of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai has collapsed and the island has lost a substantial percentage of its initial surface area, said the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). A rescue operation began on Sunday for Atata, which has a population of about 100 people, with an evacuation under way. ""Challenges to sea and air transportation remain due to damage sustained by the wharves and the ash that is covering the runways,"" the PM's office said. A thick layer of ash blankets the islands, the aerial images provided to Tonga by New Zealand and Australia showed. The archipelago's main Fua’amotu International Airport was not damaged but the ash was having to be manually cleared from the runway, with the earliest opening being on Wednesday, the OCHA said. As well as the damage locally, scientists say the eruption could have a long lasting impact on coral reefs, coastlines and fisheries in the wider region, as well as causing acid rain https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/tongas-volcanic-eruption-may-harm-environment-years-scientists-say-2022-01-18. Parts of Peru's coast were dirtied by oil https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/peru-says-oil-spill-affects-least-2-kilometers-pacific-coast-beaches-2022-01-18 spilled from a discharge ship rocked by waves caused by the eruption, Peruvian Environment Minister Ruben Ramirez said. Clean water sources remain a concern and Tonga's government has advised people to drink only bottled water as sources may be contaminated with ash, debris and the sea, the OCHA said. The Tongan navy has deployed with health teams and water, food and tents to the Ha'apai islands, with more aid sent on Tuesday, the prime minister's office said. The NZDF images, posted on Facebook and confirmed by Tu’ihalangingie, showed tarpaulins being used as shelter on Mango, one of the kingdom's 176 islands https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/tonga-its-volcanic-eruption-2022-01-18. UNDERSEA CABLE Tonga is expected to issue formal requests for aid soon but in the meantime New Zealand said two ships, HMNZS Wellington and HMNZS Aotearoa, had set off with water supplies, survey teams and a helicopter. U.N. teams are on standby, the OCHA said. Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said C-130 aircraft from Australia could deliver humanitarian assistance including water purification kits, while the HMAS Adelaide, which would take five days to get to Tonga, was ready to take engineering and medical teams and helicopter support. The PM's office said some limited communications had been made with satellite phones, but some areas remained cut off. For families waiting for news, the silence was deafening. ""The worst fear is always that you're not going to see the people that you love again,"" said Seini Taumoepeau, a Tongan-Australian in Sydney who has relatives across the islands. International mobile phone network provider Digicel has set up an interim system on the main island using the University of South Pacific’s satellite dish, New Zealand said. Subcom, a U.S. based private company contracted to repair subsea cables in the Asia-Pacific, said it was working with Tonga Cable Ltd to repair the link that runs from Tonga to Fiji. Samiuela Fonua, the chair of Tonga Cable, said there were two cuts in the undersea cable that would not be fixed until volcanic activity ceased, allowing repair crews access.

1/19/2022,"The new Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus is continuing its march around the planet. It’s now the dominant lineage in the United States, much of South America and Europe, and many Asian countries. The new variant is a nasty one. But some countries have weathered Omicron without registering any significant increase in severe illness or death. Cases go way up. Serious cases don’t. Singapore and South Africa are great examples. But other countries—the United States, for one—haven’t seen the same high degree of “decoupling” between infections and deaths. Now, epidemiologists are scrambling to figure out why. Differences in vaccination rates is an obvious explanation, but demographic factors also seem to play an important role. “Countries that have average age on the younger side and generally healthier populations would be expected to do better in terms of hospitalizations and deaths,” Irwin Redlener, the founding director of Columbia University’s National Center for Disaster Preparedness, told The Daily Beast. “The other big question,” he added, “is vaccination rates.” Highly vaxxed and younger countries seem to be mostly shrugging off Omicron. But under-vaxxed countries—especially ones with older populations–could be in for a difficult few months as the new variant runs its course. The Next Big COVID Variant Could Be a Triple Whammy Nightmare Omicron raised alarms in health agencies all over the world in late November after officials in South Africa reported the first cases. Compared to older lineages, Omicron features around 50 key mutations, around 30 of which are on the spike protein that helps the virus grab onto our cells. Some of the mutations are associated with a virus’s ability to dodge antibodies and thus reduce the effectiveness of the COVID vaccines. Others are associated with higher transmissibility. The lineage’s genetic makeup has driven a huge spike in infections in the unvaccinated as well as an increase in milder breakthrough infections in the vaccinated. The World Health Organization reported a weekly record of 15 million new COVID cases for the first week of January—a figure the WHO cautioned is almost certainly an undercount owing to incomplete data. Many of those cases are mild or entirely asymptomatic. Virologists partially attribute Omicron’s relative mildness in many cases to its tendency to infect the throat rather than the lungs, where the pathogen can do much more damage. But external factors matter, too. It should go without saying that countries that have vaccinated almost all of their population have fared better than countries where vaccination rates lag. Consider Singapore, one of the most jabbed countries in the world. Singaporean authorities detected the first local case of Omicron in early December. A month later, the lineage accounts for most new infections in the Southeast Asian city-state, population 5.7 million. Cases spiked in Singapore after Omicron arrived. There were around 250 new infections a day back in mid-December. Now there are 800 a day and climbing–a threefold increase in just a month. But the death rate is flat. On average, one person a day died of COVID in Singapore in December. In January, the rate is still one death a day. “We are still early in our Omicron outbreak,” Paul Ananth Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection in Singapore, told The Daily Beast. “Still, there is no reason to believe why Singapore will not be like most other countries in the world, with a decoupling of cases and deaths.” Experts pointed to Singapore’s excellent vaccine uptake. Around 90 percent of the population has been fully vaccinated, most with two doses of the leading messenger-RNA vaccines. Half have gone back for a booster dose. Yes, Omicron somewhat reduces the effectiveness of the vaccines. But even with its ability to evade vaccine-induced antibodies, the lineage ran into a wall of immunity in Singapore. South Africa has also managed to weather Omicron–and has done it without widespread vaccination. A little more than a quarter of South Africans are fully vaccinated with a one- or two-dose vaccine. Very few have been boosted. Despite this, infections and deaths decoupled—albeit not as dramatically as they did in Singapore. Between late November and late December, cases spiked by a factor of 40, from 500 a day to more than 20,000. Deaths increased only eightfold from around 20 a day to 170 or so. Many South Africans had natural immunity left over from the previous wave of infections over the summer. But those antibodies fade fast, so they alone can’t explain South Africa’s relative good fortune with Omicron. Age is probably a factor. South Africa, population 59 million, is a young country. The median age is just 27, compared to a median age closer to 40 in Singapore. Younger people tend to be less vulnerable to all COVID variants than their parents and grandparents—and Omicron is no exception. But there aren’t a lot of countries that can count on their very young populations to save them from the worst outcomes as Omicron circles the globe. The United States, median age 39, certainly can’t. The U.S. is in an unfortunate category of older-age countries with middling vaccination rates. That puts Americans at particular risk. “The worry is that once spread occurs among older segments [of the population], hospitalizations and deaths might creep up,” Edwin Michael, an epidemiologist at the Center for Global Health Infectious Disease Research at the University of South Florida, told The Daily Beast. Just 63 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated, 37 percent are boosted. That leaves 122 million people with, at best, fading natural immunity to COVID. It should come as no surprise that Omicron is tearing through this large, mostly unprotected group. The U.S. has registered 760,000 new COVID cases a day in recent days, a fivefold increase over the worst days of the Delta wave in the fall and triple the previous record of 230,000 new cases a day a year ago. There’s been some decoupling in the United States, but nowhere near as much as in Singapore and South Africa. Around 1,700 Americans are dying every day—slightly fewer than died every day at the peak of the Delta wave in the fall. Dreams of a New COVID Pill Panacea Have Been Dashed America’s not alone. Brazil, median age 34, has fully vaccinated around two-thirds of its 212 million people and boosted 15 percent, making it roughly analogous to the United States in those regards. Unsurprisingly, Omicron is hitting hard there. Cases spiked by a factor of 10 this month to a record 44,000 a day. The death rate is increasing fast—from a low of fewer than 50 a day in early January to a whopping 600 in a single day on Jan. 9. Experts caution that the numbers coming out of Brazil are mostly likely an undercount. Under COVID-denying President Jair Bolsonaro, the Brazilian health ministry no longer reliably reports COVID data. “The Ministry of Health doesn’t want people to know the truth,” Pedro Hallal, an epidemiologist at Federal University of Pelotas in Brazil, told The Daily Beast. Inconsistent data forces epidemiologists to round out the official COVID figures with educated guesswork. Hallal for one has seen Omicron’s impact firsthand. Just a few of his immediate family caught Delta. More than a dozen have caught Omicron. “It is exploding,” he said of the new variant. As uneven as Omicron’s impacts have been across the planet, experts agreed it could have been worse. Imagine a lineage that has Omicron’s vaccine-evasion and extreme transmissibility and also attacks the lungs like Delta does. “We can say we dodged a bullet,” Stephanie James, the head of a COVID testing lab at Regis University in Colorado, told The Daily Beast. The world is lucky that, pretty much everywhere, there’s been a decoupling between Omicron cases and deaths. To a great extent, people get to decide how wide that decoupling is. You can’t choose your country’s median age, but you can choose to get vaccinated. The more people who get vaccinated, the greater the gap between case-rates and death-rates. Vaccinate almost everyone in your city, state, region, or country, and chances are you’ll sail right through the Omicron surge with very few serious consequences. Read more at The Daily Beast.
