4/22/2022,"An Ohio State University student leader is facing criticism from other students for a comment he made during a student government meeting in March, stating that he'd ""love"" to live in a world where ""Black people were taught that they are superior."" John Fuller, who was parliamentarian of the Ohio State University Undergraduate Student Government General Assembly at the time of the meeting, made the comments while presenting a resolution aimed at condemning all anti-critical race theory legislation, according to OSU's student newspaper The Lantern. During the March 23 general assembly meeting, Fuller said that White people are taught they are ""superior"" to other races, and would ""love"" to see that change. ""I just wanted to say that and make this very clear, the only people who are taught that they are superior to another race are White people,"" Fuller said. ""And I would absolutely love to live in a world where Black people were taught that they are superior."" UTAH'S WESTMINSTER COLLEGE OFFERS 'PORN' CLASS WHERE STUDENTS WILL 'WATCH PORNOGRAPHIC FILMS TOGETHER' Fuller said that he ""full-heartedly"" believes that Black people are superior. ""I would love it because I full-heartedly believe that,"" he added. Fuller said that taking away the teaching of one race as superior is White supremacy. ""By taking away the teaching of one race as superior to another, that is inherently White supremacy,"" Fuller said. ""Because White people learn from birth that they are superior, there is nothing that they need to be taught in school that tells them that. They learn that from their lived experiences."" Fuller later repeated his original claim, saying that ""I do believe that Black people are superior."" Undergraduate Student Government President Jacob Chang told the student newspaper that the comments were ""diverging from our values."" ""The comments made during the General Assembly session is fundamentally, like, diverging from our values as the student government of Ohio State,"" Chang said. ""Therefore, it is our responsibility to report a case like this. I think we need to stand in solidarity with all people of color and anyone who suffers from racism, but we need to do it from a space that is unilaterally empowering everyone around them instead of like single out one group."" U.S. COLLEGES REINSTATE MASK REQUIREMENTS, BUT EXPERT SAYS 'THE TIME FOR MASK MANDATES IS GONE' Chang told the student newspaper that senators did consider impeaching Fuller, but said that the process would have gone past Fuller's last day in his position, which was April 6. He said that when Fuller made the comments, Speaker of the General Assembly Bobby McAlpine dismissed him. A website for the student government still lists Fuller as the parliamentarian for the General Assembly. Several members of the student government reported the comments to the Office of Institutional Equity. While the resolution condemning anti-critical race theory legislation passed, Chang said that Fuller presented it in a way that showed ""another form of like supremacy,"" saying his comments were ""inherently racist."" ""No matter what race you are from, what background you are from, you cannot say stuff like that,"" Chang said. A spokesperson for Ohio State University told Fox News that it is reviewing the matter. ""The university is aware of this matter and is currently reviewing. Ohio Senate Bill 40, which became law in 2020, and the First Amendment of the United States Constitution expressly prohibit state universities from restricting the peaceful exercise of free speech rights,"" the spokesperson said.

4/22/2022,"PHOENIX (AP) — The Arizona Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that the state's voters do not have the right to reject a massive income tax cut approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature and Gov. Doug Ducey last year. The decision means a tax cut is in effect that will hit nearly $2 billion when it is fully in place and mainly benefits the wealthy. The high court overturned a lower court judge who ruled in favor of education advocates who collected enough signatures under the state's referendum law to block them from taking effect until voters could weigh in in November. Lawyers for the Arizona Free Enterprise Club, a conservative pro-business group that pushes for lower taxes and regulations, argued the state constitution does not allow referrals for measures that provide for the “support and maintenance” of state government and that the tax cut bill falls into that category. The Supreme Court agreed in a brief order issued just two days after it heard arguments in the case. The order signed by Chief Justice Robert Brutinel does not explain the court's reasoning, saying a full opinion will be released later. The lower court judge had said that the constitutional provision only blocked referendums on bills that appropriate money, and since the tax cut bill does not do that, it is subject to voter review. Ducey, a Republican who pushed for an expansion of the court in 2016 that has allowed him to appoint six of the seven justices, hailed the decision. “This ruling is another big win for our state’s taxpayers and it couldn’t have come at a better time,” he said in a statement. “With inflation hitting Arizonans hard, this decision ultimately means more of their hard-earned dollars can stay in their wallets.” Most residents won't see much help, because the vast majority of the tax cuts go to the wealthy. The Legislature's budget analysts said the average Arizonan earning between $75,000 and $100,000 will save $231 a year in state income taxes. Meanwhile, the average taxpayer earning between $500,000 and $1 million a year will save more than $12,000, according to the Legislature’s budget analysts. The coalition of progressive groups that backed the referendum slammed the Supreme Court for “stripping the rights of everyday Arizonans, in an attempt to protect the rich.” ""The ballot was Arizona’s last line of defense from the Ducey-packed Supreme Court – today that defense has fallen,"" said the statement from two groups backing Invest in Arizona. “Despite the explicit and strong language of the Arizona Constitution granting the people a co-equal right to legislate, they have been shut out."" The Arizona Center for Economic Progress and the Children's Action Alliance said voters have repeatedly backed measures that boosted school funding, child care and other progressive causes, only to have them blocked by the high court or erased by the Legislature. Earlier this year, a Supreme Court decision led to the demise of a tax on the wealthy designed to fund schools that voters approved in 2020. That came after lawmakers passed a law during last year's session that would have cut the expected $900 million in funding by more than half. Free Enterprise Club President Scot Mussi called the Supreme Court ruling a “big win for taxpayers.” ""Invest in Arizona and out-of-state special interest groups need to accept this reality and stop making a farce of the referendum process,” Mussi said in a series of tweets. Arizona's constitution lets voters block newly enacted laws by collecting signatures from 5% of qualified voters. If they do, the law is put on hold until the next general election. Lawmakers at the Capitol were split along party lines, just as they were last year when majority Republicans who hold bare majorities in the House and Senate enacted the tax cuts with no Democratic support. House Majority Leader Rep. Ben Toma said the decision provides clarity and certainty, and means tax historic relief is not in effect. Sen. Rebecca Rios, who leads minority Democrats in her chamber, said she was “disappointed to say the least.” “A true Democracy should have no problem allowing this to go before the voters of Arizona,” Rios said in a statement. “Republicans continue to attack our schools, teachers and students, despite a majority of Arizonans making it clear time and time again that they want meaningful investments in our public schools.” Republicans were planning on getting around the referendum by repealing the tax cuts and enacting larger ones, but that will no longer be necessary. Under the new law, rates for most taxpayers would drop to a flat 2.5%, and revenue would be cut by $1.9 billion once the tax cuts are fully in place. That’s down from a range of 2.59% to 4.5%.

4/22/2022,"A court in Rwanda sentenced a Chinese businessman to 20 years in prison for torture after he was filmed beating a local man last year. Sun Shujun, the manager of a mine in the west of the country, had been accused of beating his workers in a case that drew attention because he was filmed whipping a man tethered to a pole on the ground. Judge Jacques Kanyarukiga said it was clear that Sun ""tortured the victims and issued corporal punishment with malicious intent, and this is a grave crime"".

A Rwandan man, Renzaho Alexis, was sentenced to 12 years for his alleged role as an accomplice in the beatings. The spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Rwanda responds to media inquiries on the recent ruling regarding a Chinese citizen. See the picture below for full text: pic.twitter.com/ZCPKBLHavm - Chinese Embassy in Rwanda (@ChinaEmbinRW) April 20, 2022 Sun, who was in court for the verdict, acknowledged assaulting two workers, saying he beat them because he was ""frustrated and fed up of them constantly stealing minerals"". The 43-year-old had argued for his release, saying he had compensated the two by paying a total of more than 1 million Rwandan francs (about US$1,000) and signing a ""reconciliation letter"". However, the prosecution - which had accused him of assaulting four people - argued that the victims had accepted the payments ""because they were traumatised and afraid of him"". A 45-second clip of one incident was widely shared online last year, showing a visibly enraged Chinese man using a rope to flog a man huddled on the ground and tied to a pole, as a small group of people in orange jackets looked on. The mine produces cassiterite, a mineral that is the main ore of tin. The Chinese embassy in Rwanda acknowledged Tuesday's verdict in a statement on Wednesday urging Chinese citizens living in Rwanda to abide by local laws. ""Meanwhile, the embassy calls for the case to be handled appropriately in a rational, fair and just manner and requests the legitimate rights of the Chinese citizens to be properly protected,"" the statement said. After the verdict, Sun - who had been free on bail - was put handcuffed and taken away by guards. He has up to 30 days to appeal.
