5/2/2022,"Plans for a $460m integrated mental health facility in Sydney’s west have been welcomed as a step in the right direction in addressing the “enormous” need for better and fairer care across the state. But the Australian Medical Association New South Wales head, Dr Danielle McMullen, said the “million-dollar question” was how the complex at Westmead would be staffed, amid ongoing issues of doctor and nurse furloughing and burnout. The state’s premier, Dominic Perrottet, on Monday announced that the new facility would be built in western Sydney and would begin serving the region’s growing population from 2026. “This development will ensure our diverse communities have access to world-class mental healthcare” Perrottet said. The centre will eventually replace the “outdated” mental health facilities at Cumberland hospital and will have an acute assessment unit and beds, sub and non-acute mental health beds, outpatient services and education. The health minister, Brad Hazzard, said the facility would benefit people living with multiple health conditions by bringing services together. “Co-location of mental health services with Westmead hospital will maximise the opportunities for mental health teams to work alongside other health teams to ensure timely assessment and care planning,” Hazzard said. McMullen welcomed the multipronged approach outlined by the government and said it would go some way in closing the “really big” gap between public and private care, with more action needed in the meantime. “The need [for better mental healthcare] in NSW and across Australia is just enormous,” she said. “We really do need more support for what we often call the missing middle – the people that are too unwell to be managed with their GP and psychology support but often aren’t unwell enough to need the current public hospital admissions. “It will take much more than one new centre but you have to start somewhere. Let’s hope that this is the beginning of a strong and integrated mental health system in NSW.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning After more than two years of additional pressure on the healthcare workforce due to Covid – including an increase in acute presentations, staff burnout and surgery backlogs – McMullen said it remained unclear how the facility and others like it would be staffed. “It is so essential that infrastructure is followed up with ongoing, recurrent funding, particularly for staffing and training,” she said. “Workforce across the healthcare sector is a really big issue going forward. More work needs to be done to make that an attractive career prospect and to make sure that our existing facilities, as well as new ones, are appropriately staffed.” Nurses have taken industrial action and strikes multiple times this year over pay and conditions. Paramedics across the state have also taken industrial action, with leaders in the sector raising concerns poor conditions and low wages would see young people leave the field entirely and lead to worse outcomes for patients. An Australian Paramedics Australia spokesperson said that having enough skilled workers was key in addressing the mental health crisis. “If there’s not enough paramedics to get someone to hospital, or enough nurses to attend to them, they won’t get the care that they deserve,” the spokesperson said. “Healthcare workers are the backbone of our healthcare system. “A long-term failure to invest in better healthcare is letting staff and patients down.” The union is calling for 1,500 extra paramedics to be hired in NSW.",News/Australia news,AMA welcomes proposed $460m mental health facility in Sydney despite questions over staffing ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/02/ama-welcomes-proposed-460m-mental-health-facility-in-sydney-despite-questions-over-staffing

5/2/2022,"Steven Gerrard prefers to vary his attacking shape to keep opponents guessing and has switched from using a midfield diamond to 4-2-3-1 to 4-3-3 in his first six months in charge at Aston Villa. The manager was in full agreement that his team looked better once Danny Ings came on as a substitute to join Ollie Watkins as split strikers, with Philippe Coutinho then playing between them, as a false 9 or as the attacking tip of a diamond depending on your interpretation. Both strikers scored in the victory that relegated Norwich and were also instrumental when Villa went on a three-game winning run in February and March, though Ings, with six goals and several niggly injuries in his first season at the club, admitted: “Overall this season for me has been a little underwhelming. I am happy to come on today and help. It is hard to get a rhythm.” Peter Lansley Match report: Aston Villa 2-0 Norwich Ahead of kick-off against Chelsea there were a few raised eyebrows when the Gwladys Street End unfurled a banner dedicated to Jordan Pickford. After all, Pickford has long been one of the most ridiculed players in the Everton squad, with his outsized personality and hair-raising hot and cold streaks. Nobody was laughing at full time, after Pickford pulled off perhaps the save of the season to deny César Azpilicueta. Normally it’s not great news if your goalkeeper is grabbing the plaudits, but with Everton scrapping for their Premier League survival, their influential and talismanic goalkeeper may just be warming up to the task. Jonathan Liew Match report: Everton 1-0 Chelsea After watching his side ease past Leeds, albeit with some initial difficulty, Pep Guardiola was grateful for the deliveries by Phil Foden – one a free-kick, the other a corner – that created Manchester City’s first two goals. “I’m going to give you a secret: the set piece is about the taker,” he said. “The taker is the most important thing and Phil, especially with the first goal, was fantastic.” City did not really flow until going two up but showed they can be hugely effective from dead-ball routines when more aesthetically pleasing means are out of reach. Foden found Rodri for the opener and then saw Rúben Dias nod down for Nathan Aké to convert a crucial second, but it still will not earn him the gig permanently. “When Kevin [De Bruyne] is there, Kevin is the taker,” Guardiola said. Nick Ames Match report: Leeds 0-4 Manchester City It is no coincidence that the richly gifted Bruno Guimarães had his most disappointing game for Newcastle on the day he found himself up against James Milner. The latter played a key role alongside the excellent Naby Keïta and Jordan Henderson, helping ensure Guimarães, Joe Willock and Jonjo Shelvey were thoroughly upstaged as, courtesy of Keïta’s 19th-minute goal, Liverpool won 1-0 on Tyneside. At 36, Milner – who made his debut for Leeds 20 years ago – made the very most of a rare start, emphasising precisely why his manager trusts him. “Milly’s a role model,” said Jürgen Klopp as his side maintained the pressure on Manchester City. “He’s a role model. Nothing we’ve achieved in the last few years would have happened without James Milner. He sets standards in a way not a lot of people can; it’s educated all of us.” Louise Taylor Match report: Newcastle 0-1 Liverpool After a fine start to his time on the south coast, Armando Broja has failed to score in his past 13 Premier League appearances for Southampton. The forward is 20 years old, so few can criticise a striker in his first full season as a Premier League footballer for struggling to maintain his form. The Albania international has scored six times in 30 appearances. In recent months he has not been aided by the team’s collective poor form that has seen them win a solitary match in nine league outings. Against Palace, Broja was left on the bench, coming on the 65th minute with Southampton looking for a winner in a match they would go on to eventually lose. Broja failed to have any noticeable impact – he will be looking to reach the end of the season after learning about the rigours of a long season but he has proved over the campaign that he has plenty more to show. Will Unwin Match report: Southampton 1-2 Crystal Palace Brendan Rodgers admitted he has a delicate balancing act as Leicesterattempt to overturn their 2-1 deficit from the first leg of their Europa Conference League semi-final against Roma on Thursday. He made eight changes for the trip to Tottenham, with only Kasper Schmeichel, Timothy Castagne and Marc Albrighton keeping their places as Son Heung-min and Harry Kane proved the difference. For Rodgers, however, the focus is already on their trip to the Italian capital. “It’s the nature of our season – we have been riddled with injuries and I can’t afford to risk playing those coming back three times a week,” he said. “It’s nice to be able to do that and still be competitive. If we can add one or two then we might be able to be up there challenging again next season.” Ed Aarons Match report: Tottenham 3-1 Leicester Mike Jackson insists he has not waved a magic wand, during his inspired stint as caretaker manager, but he has conjured up a remarkable turnaround to move Burnley clear of the relegation zone. Sean Dyche’s dismissal provoked plenty of raised eyebrows but Jackson has been a revelation, with three successive wins lifting them out of the bottom three. The belief and momentum garnered from their late turnaround for the victory at Watford will surely carry them a long way towards safety. For Watford, a record-breaking 11th successive defeat at home leaves them on the brink of relegation. Watford could learn some lessons from Burnley’s history of coaching continuity although ironically their recent upheaval, with Jackson taking temporary charge, appears to have been the catalyst in getting out of trouble. Simon Mail Match report: Watford 1-2 Burnley It was a tale of two sets of centre-backs at the London Stadium where Rob Holding and Gabriel scored the goals that clinched Arsenal’s victory over West Ham. Former Bolton defender Holding was called into the side due to Ben White’s absence and proved himself a valuable back-up with some fine blocks and a vital header. West Ham’s back four was stitched together due to injuries and suspensions. Aaron Cresswell was moved inside to play alongside Kurt Zouma, while Ryan Fredericks was selected at left-back. The loss of a second genuine centre-back was shown at set pieces; Arsenal’s two goals came from corners thanks to a Holding header and Gabriel finding space at the back post. If the Hammers had an experienced centre-back available, they are likely to have avoided one of those goals. West Ham are paying the price of success, which brings more games, leaving a tired squad at the start of May. Will Unwin Match report: West Ham 1-2 Arsenal Regardless of what happens in Brighton’s remaining three games, this is a season that will be fondly remembered after the club achieved its best points tally in the Premier League following victory at Wolves. For Graham Potter, whose quiet leadership and possession-based style has given them a sniff of a top-half finish, the challenge of building on such a strong campaign lies around the corner. Yves Bissouma, Leandro Trossard, Adam Webster and Tariq Lamptey are among those linked with bigger fish but Potter is relaxed about the prospect of his key players attracting bids, adamant Brighton will only sell at the right time and for the right price. “At the end of last season we sold Ben White for £50m [to Arsenal] and we managed to improve,” Potter said, citing Saturday’s opponents as a source of inspiration. “Wolves have sold players and carried on trying to develop.” Ben Fisher Match report: Wolves 0-3 Brighton We are reaching that time of the season when player departures and retirements are announced with glee, allowing those moving on to pastures new a send-off. The Premier League will be losing, at least, three experienced referees after the news that Jon Moss, Martin Atkinson and Mike Dean will all be hanging up their whistles in May. As with any match officials, fans will have their varying views based on individual decisions that have caused pain to their clubs down the years but it is hard to argue that they are all high-quality referees. Replacing three of a team’s most experienced players in one go is hard enough and it will be no different for the Professional Game Match Officials Limited. Between the three of them, 50 years of Premier League experience will be lost on the pitch. It was plain to see Paul Tierney’s struggles at the weekend when refereeing a high-profile match, so the loss of three of the best in England will be felt by players and fans alike.

5/2/2022,"There was an obvious determination among England’s grand slam winners to savour the moment after completing their clean sweep against France on Saturday but it was back to reality soon enough for Simon Middleton’s side. England teams tend to travel with British Airways – one of the Rugby Football Union’s sponsors – but the airline does not fly from Biarritz and it was an early start and a lengthy coach journey the morning after the night before. For whatever reason no extra flight was chartered. It serves as a reminder that for all the progress made during the competition – two record crowds in Leicester and Gloucester and a sold-out stadium in Bayonne on Saturday, not to mention a peak BBC Two audience of 700,000 – there is much more to be made. England can at least take solace that in every other facet they exude professionalism and this Six Nations triumph in which they scored 45 tries, conceding just four, may yet prove to be a significant moment in the history of the sport. For it has jolted their rivals into belated action over contracting players and, though the gap is a chasm between England, France and the rest there now seems a will to act. The image of Ireland’s Aoife McDermott back at work the day after facing England has endured and Sarah Bern, scorer of two of the Red Roses’ tries on Saturday, issued a warning over the welfare of players who face such situations. “I have a lot of friends who play for Wales, Scotland and Ireland [and] it is really hard work,” she said. “Things need to change not just for the rugby but for the girls’ own mental health. I’m always there to fight for their corner because I think everyone should have equal opportunity.” If change is coming, it is unlikely to bear fruit on the pitch before the World Cup this autumn – and it can be said with some certainty that England, France or New Zealand will be crowned champions in Auckland in November. The victory for England on Saturday was telling in that regard because, while France were competitive, Middleton’s side remain a cut above. It would be no surprise, though, if he spent much of the coach journey pondering recent events in New Zealand. The Black Ferns have won five of the past six World Cups but were emphatically beaten by both England and France last autumn. There were mitigating circumstances – the pandemic is the most obvious among them – but it has forced the union into considerable action. Wayne Smith has been appointed director of rugby, Sir Graham Henry is on board in a supporting role and Whitney Hansen – daughter of Steve – is among the assistants. Middleton, then, will be pitting his wits against three of the most famous names in All Black history. “A lot has happened in the Black Ferns camp since the autumn,” he said. “We look at the moves they’ve made, it’s a massive mark of respect for the game. What will be interesting is how their new coaching structure changes them because it is a different sort of environment that you have to create. It’ll be interesting to see how they go but it’s exciting to pit your wits against coaches of that calibre.” Middleton’s squad will return to their clubs this week but come July World Cup preparations will ramp up. England have warm-up Tests planned for September and there is already a realisation that improvements must be made before they leave for New Zealand. “We know what we’ve got to do to be classed as a great side but we’re getting there,” Middleton said. Indeed, if England were defensively defiant against France and dominant at the set-piece, it was not a match that will live long in the memory. Middleton said: “We need to find a way to free the girls up so they feel like they can play a bit more.” It is a message not lost on his players, to which Bern’s determination attested: “To sit here and say we’ve got this in the bag would be stupid. We know there’s so much more we want to work on. New Zealand have got some brilliant coaches coming in. France we know will always come back for the fight. “Everyone will turn up for the World Cup. We need to make sure we’re there and as turned up as everyone else.”",Sport/Sport,Six Nations-shattering England turn to Black Ferns challenge at World Cup | Gerard Meagher,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/02/womens-six-nations-england-turn-to-black-ferns-challenge-womens-rugby-world-cup
5/2/2022,"Previously unseen work by a photographer who captured life in Edinburgh and has been compared to the great Henri Cartier-Bresson is to go on display at an exhibition in the city where he lived and worked. Robert Blomfield moved to Edinburgh from Yorkshire and studied medicine in the city while living a second life as a pioneering street photographer who shifted between shooting university students, locals and the landscape of the Scottish capital. The curator Daryl Green said it was “astounding” that Blomfield, who was described as taking “an unobtrusive, fly-on-the-wall approach”, has remained relatively unknown for so long. “In his work, we sense echoes of earlier street photographers like Eugène Atget and Henri Cartier-Bresson, and we can discern the rich attachment to place that we see in contemporaries such as Robert Frank and William Klein,” he said. “As his vast archive slowly comes into light, it is clear that Robert was Edinburgh’s quiet answer to Glasgow’s Oscar Marzaroli, to Paris’s Brassaï.” Born in Leeds and raised in Sheffield, Blomfield received his first camera on his 15th birthday and continued taking photographs until his death in December 2020, but his work – which was said to be inspired by Robert Capa’s adage, “If your pictures aren’t good enough, you’re not close enough” – was largely unseen during his lifetime. The exhibition, titled Robert Blomfield: Student of Light, at the University of Edinburgh, where he studied, is the second major survey of his work and follows a show at the City Art Centre in Edinburgh in 2018. Blomfield arrived in Edinburgh to study medicine in 1956 and took a camera with him almost everywhere, even into class, producing shots of lectures and laboratories that are described as unique in their access and composition. In late 2021, his archive of original prints, film and colour slides from Scotland was deposited in the University of Edinburgh’s Centre for Research Collections. His images include atmospheric smoke-filled shots inside the student union as sunlight streams in through windows, while images of an anatomy lecture, a rowing contest, and crowds waiting to see Prince Philip in 1958 give a sense of the breadth of student life in the city in the 50s and 60s. Blomfield took eight years to complete a six-year degree, and he stayed in Edinburgh after graduating in 1964 to start as a junior doctor at the city’s royal infirmary. Student of Light focuses on Blomfield’s time as a student and will showcase some of his camera equipment, including lenses, enlargers, filters and an astronomical telescope used to achieve a large depth of field. By the mid-1960s, Blomfield was regularly seen with two cameras around his neck. Both were usually loaded with black-and-white film and fitted with different lenses, but he would occasionally shoot colour film. “Although he had experimented with colour since his school days, it wasn’t a regular part of his repertoire,” said Green. “Colour film was more expensive and had to be sent off to a lab to be developed, and when the slides returned, Robert never enlarged them to prints himself.” Robert Blomfield: Student of Light is supported by the Scottish Funding Council and will run from from 6 May to 1 October at the University of Edinburgh main library.",Arts/Art and design,Edinburgh show will display street photographer’s never-before-seen work,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/02/robert-blomfield-photography-exhibition-edinburgh-university
5/2/2022,"You may have seen the famous clip of Diego Maradona’s warm-up routine, from the second leg of Napoli’s Uefa Cup semi-final against Bayern Munich in 1989: the one where he is like a Marvel superhero with a football. It is not just that Maradona pogos up and down with the ball seemingly glued to his head. Or that he effortlessly juggles the ball on his knees while jogging – before upping the ante by then bouncing it repeatedly off alternate shoulders. It is that the greatest player of all time is doing all this, and many other nonchalant tricks and flicks, with his shoelaces untied. Maradona’s extraordinary routine, which has been viewed tens of millions of times on YouTube, came to mind again while watching another renegade master, Ronnie O’Sullivan, caress, finesse and blast his way to another world snooker final. For retired professional-turned-pundit Alan McManus, the Rocket’s red and black combination against John Higgins were the best two shots back-to-back he has seen in a semi-final, while these eyes slightly preferred the blunt power of a red to the middle against Stephen Maguire. Either way, O’Sullivan has a rare knack of making the ball dance to his tune, just like El Diego. And if he does win a magnificent seventh world title by converting his 12-5 lead over Judd Trump on Monday – a feat that would equal Stephen Hendry’s record – the clamour for him to be ordained as the greatest ever will become a crescendo. I am not quite there – yet. O’Sullivan is a genius. But I still make Hendry primus inter pares, by a squeak. Let me build a case. It starts by pointing out that no one else in the modern era can hold a cue to what Hendry did in the 1990s, when he ruled the sport and was the youngest world champion in history at 21. Back in the late 90s, in my early days as a journalist on Total Sport, I visited Hendry’s club in Stirling for our Show Us Your Medals section. There were so many – 70 titles in total – that we had to settle on just a dozen. He was that dominant. For good measure Hendry also spent a record‑breaking nine years as world No 1, ahead of Steve Davis on seven. O’Sullivan, whose career began 30 years ago, has spent five years on top. In the past fortnight there has been a lot of talk about the “Class of 92” – O’Sullivan, Higgins and Mark Williams. And rightly so. But Hendry, in his prime, often took them to school. Back then Hendry could pot with the best of them and he was also blessed with a natural immunity to pressure. Never was that better illustrated when, 30 years ago this week, he came from 14-8 down to defeat Jimmy White 18-14 and win the 1992 world title in what Clive Everton described on these pages as the “most dramatic and emphatic recovery seen in a Crucible final”. Perhaps the crucial moment came at 14-9 down as Hendry, with the cue ball in the jaws of the middle pocket, rolled in a brilliant brown. “Had he missed it he would have certainly trailed 15-9,” wrote Everton. “But by potting it he showed he was not intimidated by the score, the opponent, the occasion or the huge crowd largely rooting for White.” History repeated itself in 1993 when Hendry thrashed White 18-5 in the world championship final, having lost only 25 frames in five matches. That was a staggering enough feat. But the Scot was able to surpass it in 1994, beating White 18-17 in the final despite fracturing an elbow while going to the bathroom in the middle of the night earlier in the tournament. It only solidified the image of Hendry as snooker’s Terminator: a cold-blooded destroyer even with one arm barely functioning. And Hendry did all this despite never being a darling of the masses, like the Rocket or Whirlwind. We hear a lot of talk about the benefits of home advantage in sport but Hendry usually had the crowd against him – and worse. Facing White at Wembley was particularly bad. “I always have people shouting ‘miss’ underneath their breath when I’m right on the shot and stuff like that,” Hendry told me, before saying: “I’ve had a lot of success there, so I can’t say it put me off.” Yet after Hendry’s seventh and final world title in 1999, something changed. In an interview with Donald McRae on these pages in 2018 he admitted that, when he began to socialise with the other players, it “affected his invincibility” – although he attributed his decline more to a serious version of a golfer’s yips, which began in 2000. Inevitably it means there is a recency bias towards O’Sullivan when the topic of the greatest comes up. But last week O’Sullivan himself acknowledged just how good Hendry was in his prime, saying: “He used to play six hours a day and didn’t miss a ball. There is no one dominating the sport like he did, like Tiger Woods did.” It says something of the class of both men that Hendry was just as effusive about O’Sullivan. “No one does it better,” he said. “You cannot play better snooker than that. He is just supreme in all departments.” It is hard to argue. But my mind keeps coming back to a match the two men played in the 1997 Liverpool Victoria Charity Challenge, which featured seven centuries and is widely regarded as one of the best ever. Hendry went 8-2 up in a best-of-17 encounter. O’Sullivan pulled it back to 8-8. The Scot’s response?

5/2/2022,"Pick the odd one out: Route 66; Biarritz to Santiago de Compostela; Burnley to Blackburn. Yes, it’s a trick question, because all of these routes have played seminal roles in history, especially the last one. Overlooked since the last millworker hung up her clogs, the cultural riches of a 23-mile stretch of the Leeds-Liverpool Canal are now being revived by a project called the Super Slow Way – named after a poem set to a libretto by Ian McMillan. The project was launched in 2016, the bicentennial of the canal, and while stymied by the pandemic, this year it revs up to full speed – about four miles an hour – with the launch of a government-funded Lancashire Linear Park and a host of community-focused events and spaces along the towpath. And not before time. Even within Lancashire the area is overlooked. While the north, east and west flanks of Pendle Hill boast green and pleasant landscapes popular with hill walkers, the south is densely populated, post-industrial, multicultural and economically deprived. The canal, though, provides an inviting calm space, as it meanders like a river on its journey from Barrowford in the Pendle district, through Burnley, Accrington and Rishton, into the suburban sprawl of Blackburn. Built to service mills and mines, it’s been looking for a new role for more than half a century – the Super Slow Way might just do the job. You can walk it, cycle it, run it or barge it. Or a mixture of those. Here’s what to look out for en route, however fast or slow you go. Reopened at Easter after the winter break, Pendle Heritage Centre has displays dedicated to George Fox and the Quakers, the Pendle Witches, social history and the vernacular architecture of Pendle forest; there’s a walled garden, bluebell wood and tea room. Higherford Mill, a spinning mill, built in 1824, houses artists’ studios. The north-light weaving shed, built in 1849, is the oldest such structure in the world. The town also has a 16th-century packhorse bridge, used by packhorse trains carrying coal from nearby Gisburn. The Good Life Project is a series of pop-up growing and food workshops, while artist Hannah Fincham is leading a project called Eat the Canal which explores how the natural environment can be utilised and food production can become local and sustainable. Hannah is creating a foraging map with markers along the canal so people can (safely) identify edible and medicinal plants. On Vernon Street, Unity Hall – recently rebranded as Unity Well Being Centre – is a former independent Labour party socialist institute; inside is a display about suffragist and pacifist Selina Cooper, part of Mid Pennine Arts’ Pendle Radicals programme. Contact Gary Webb to arrange a visit. Many of Lancashire’s mills have been torn down, but Brierfield Mills, built in 1868 on the site of an earlier mill, is still standing. Inside are swanky apartments but you can still admire the Grade II listed building. In Briercliffe, two miles from the canal, the Grade I listed Queen Street Textile Mill Museum still has working looms. Wetlab Canal Kitchen is a floating laboratory that brings together artists, architects, scientists, engineers, technologists, cooks and members of the public to explore the biological and social ecology of the canal. Workshops are planned at three sites during May and June. One of the sites, Finsley Gate Wharf – at a sharp bend in the canal – is a good place to set off on a hill walk if you need some non-flat exercise. Head south to the top of Crown Point to see the Singing Ringing Tree, a wind-powered musical sculpture, and take in the fine views. It’s 2.7 miles each way, or about two hours there and back. Today, the stretch of canal between Burnley and Accrington is positively pastoral, but this was once the realm of the Burnley Coalfield. There’s a small mining museum at Smithson Farm and some well-preserved beehive coke ovens (known locally as “fairy caves”) on the Church/Oswaldtwistle border. Coal power has given way to wind farms; look out for the turbines on top of Hameldon Hill. The West Pennines and other outlying hills are popular with fell walkers; runners might want to hook up with the Clayton-Le-Moors Harriers, a long-established athletics club that organises open runs. Small Bells Ring is an artwork and “living research vessel” based on a beautifully painted narrowboat called RV Furor Scribendi, created by Heather Peak Morison and Ivan Morison. It’s home to a floating short-story library, performance space and writers’ and readers’ retreat. On 25 May, the boat will cruise from Barnoldswick to Rishton with Heather and a volunteer crew. For the whole of June, it will be moored up at Bridge No 108A near the Rishton Library, with a full programme of events. Librarians and local residents here and at Accrington Library – a Carnegie library, opened in 1908, and a source of inspiration for the young Jeanette Winterson – have been trained as tillers. Homegrown Homespun is a groundbreaking regenerative fashion project created by Great British Sewing Bee judge and designer Patrick Grant and Justine Aldersey-Williams from collaborative community North West England Fibreshed. During spring and summer 2021, they turned unused land in central Blackburn into a field of flax, for linen, and woad, for blue dye.

5/2/2022,"No one came out as LGBTQ+ at my comprehensive in the north of England in the late 1990s for a very straightforward reason: it would constitute social death. Homophobia was the background hum of school life, a crude instrument to sometimes violently discipline any boy who deviated from rigid male expectations. Homophobia is, after all, the savage border guard of masculinity. A geography teacher once mentioned a young boy who was outed years back, and suffered relentless abuse and violence until they were driven permanently from the school. It was a salutary lesson imprinted on my young brain. Shamefully I, too, occasionally laughed along at anti-gay innuendoes or lowlife gags about George Michael. Why risk suspicion with all it entailed? Half-victim, half-accomplice, like everyone else, as Jean-Paul Sartre put it. I found it impossible, then, not to be moved by Netflix’s new school drama Heartstopper, which should be considered one of the most important LGBTQ+ shows ever made. It’s important to stress that it was not made for a geriatric millennial like me. It is squarely aimed at teenagers, which is one reason it is so pivotal. Written by the stunningly talented 27-year-old queer author Alice Oseman, it features a young geeky gay boy who falls for a rugby jock who, it transpires, is bisexual. Representation is at its core, with lesbians and queer people of colour – including a young trans woman who has transferred to the girls’ school – as key protagonists. Many queer older millennials have been dazzled by the show, but also felt a sense of grief and loss at what they never had: either acceptance from our straight peers, or affirming representation on our television screens. I grew up in the age of section 28, which prohibited the so-called “promotion” of homosexuality in schools and in practice stifled all discussion of LGBTQ+ issues. The one exception I recall was a teacher warning against anal sex. As someone who didn’t come out until I was 20, what was so terrifying in adolescence was the sheer loneliness of the closet. Heterosexuality offered a stable lifelong route map: find a life partner, marry, settle down, have children. With that seeming – however inaccurately – to be unattainable, what remained? The constant terror of rejection, of falling for straights who could never reciprocate, of suppressing your real identity for an easier life or to protect yourself from violence? Life is a tough enough gig, and brutally I did not want the hassle. I clung on to a passage from one of those “how to grow up” books which suggested that same-sex attraction was a temporary phase, that for many it would soon vanish. LGBTQ+ cultural representation was weak at this point, and that compounded my loneliness. In popular culture, you could either find one-dimensional desexualised caricatures, or stories of tragedy – the shadow of the HIV/Aids pandemic was inescapable. Queer people living and loving, finding acceptance and yes, confronting challenges like anybody else and seeking to overcome them, was what was lacking. This is why Heartstopper is so important. Some straight people may also look enviously at this show: regardless of sexual or gender identity, adolescence for many is defined by boredom, tedium, rejection and sometimes trauma. Most of us do not skip into the sunset with the rugby jock, after all. But at least straight people do not lack affirming representation on their TV screens. Young LGBTQ+ people now have a show with relatable and frankly adorable characters who face hardship, but who also have the possibility of happiness. Because of that, this show will be a lifeline for many. Here’s a show, too, which reflects the transformed social values of generation Z – the zoomers who, I believe, will in time save us all, if there is a planet left to save. They are not free of problems, including homophobic bullying – as Heartstopper portrays – but they are the most progressive generation yet. Thanks in no small part to the struggle of LGBTQ+ people before, they feel more at ease with questions of sexuality and gender identity – something reflected in polling that shows only 54% of generation Z are attracted exclusively to the opposite gender, compared with 81% of boomers. With Britain in the grip of a moral panic that depicts trans people as a potential threat to women and young people, positive cultural representation has never been more vital. The anti-gay rhetoric of the past damaged an entire generation. We don’t need to repeat the same mistakes. But those often terrified young trans folk have a show in which one of their own is loved and affirmed, helping to puncture that often cruel bubble of loneliness. I wonder if everyone involved in this show – from the writers to producers to actors – quite realise the impact of what they have created. They’ve offered comfort and affirmation to those who often need it the most. Not bad, not bad at all, for a show about adolescence, coming of age and love.

5/2/2022,"It’s a breathtaking dive, beautifully executed. Zeke Sanchez, aged just 14, stands on the diving board in the Arizona sun, throws his arms up and then arcs into the air, performing a backwards somersault. In another, he performs a neat tuck. In a third he completes a full mid-air twist. Zeke’s dives have gone viral, racking up more than 100m views on TikTok. Platforms like Sports Centre and ESPN have shared his videos. And on Instagram, among a pool of reposts, Sanchez has received waves of praise. “It is really phenomenal,” he told the Guardian on Sunday. “Seeing the positive responses makes me really happy because I think anyone can do anything if you put your mind to it.” This article includes content provided by Instagram.

With the fame has come some criticism, directed at his body type. But his father, Freddie Sanchez, said he was proud that Zeke was overturning stereotypes. “People see these really small men or women doing these really great things.” “I don’t think they expect to see someone a larger size doing those things,” he said. “But Zeke has a lot of heart.” “The things he does are not easy, it takes a lot of effort … Zeke is very dedicated. Not just to sport, but to everything.” Anjanette Sanchez, Zeke’s mother, said negative comments only spurred her son on. “He is a strong individual and he is able to use it as motivation to keep going,” she said. “I give him a lot of credit for his attitude.” Zeke himself chooses to see the positive side. “I can appreciate the comments”, he said. “Because [they] give me inspiration to keep working harder.” And with his videos being shared all over the world, he hopes dive college coaches will notice him.

Sanchez started diving aged eight after a two-week summer program that taught him water sports like diving and water polo. “I really really liked it,” he said. “I was like, Mom, I don’t want to do water polo. I want to keep diving.” Now Sanchez trains at East Valley Dive Club in Mesa, Arizona, under coach Lauren Lopez. “I really love the atmosphere and the teammates,” he says. “We always have a lot of fun and we are all really supportive of each other.” Since diving at the 2022 Arizona Regionals, his next challenge will be a national qualifier. From there, the top ten divers will move on to nationals. “I am super excited,” he said, “I really hope I’ll be able to make it this year.” Zeke says that competing in college diving is his “ultimate goal”. “But it would be really cool to go to the Olympics too.” Among the praise for Sanchez online, one comment stands out for Zeke. Underneath an Instagram post, actor Adam Devine wrote: “I have a new life hero.” “I didn’t think I would be someone’s hero,” Zeke said. “I felt so happy that so many people can see how hard I work, to see what I do.”",Sport/Sport,‘Anyone can do anything’: the 14-year-old diver going viral – and challenging stereotypes,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/02/14-year-old-diver-going-viral-and-challenging-stereotypes
5/2/2022,"An extremely rare medieval bible famous for an unfortunate error that encourages adultery has been discovered in New Zealand. The 1631 “Wicked” Bible, as it has become known, omits the word “not” from its seventh commandment, informing readers “thou shalt commit adultery”. One thousand copies of the text, which also came to be known as the Adulterous or Sinners’ Bible, were printed, with the error only discovered a year later. Upon discovery of the mistake, the printers Robert Barker and Martin Lucas were summoned by King Charles I and hauled before the court, where they were admonished for the scandalous typo and sloppy workmanship. They were stripped of their printing licence, had a £300 fine held over their heads for years (though it was eventually quashed) and most of the texts were destroyed. Only about 20 remain in circulation. The bibles do come up for auction from time to time mostly in Britain or US, but this is the first time one has been discovered in the southern hemisphere, says the University of Canterbury in Christchurch. The university was first informed of its existence in 2018 but chose to keep the discovery under wraps until now to allow researchers and book conservers enough time to study and preserve the book. “It’s a mystery, it’s fascinating and it has made its way halfway around the world,” Chris Jones, an associate professor in medieval studies at the university and fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in London, said on Monday. A former student of Jones’s brought the copy into to him in 2018 after her family had acquired it two years earlier at a deceased estate sale. The late owner was British bookbinder Don Hampshire, who moved to Christchurch from the UK in 2009, but as far as Jones can tell, Hampshire had never told anyone a thing about owning it. Jones’s former student told him she believed it was a “Wicked” Bible, but he was “very disbelieving because these are not common items”. “They are not things that you just walk into an office having found one in a garage in Christchurch. But I looked at it and I thought, wow, this is exactly what my former student thinks it is – it’s a Wicked Bible. I was blown away by it.” Jones said there is a copy in Canada, some in the US, others in the UK, Ireland and “a very nice copy” in Dublin. “The Australians claim they have one, but they don’t,” laughed Jones, adding that their copy does not contain the infamous omission of ‘not’. “Having one come to me in Christchurch is just remarkable.” The discovery of the book piqued Jones’s interest in the bible’s history and the myths about why the mistake was made, the court case surrounding it, and the printing industry more widely at that time, which he plans to publish papers on. Debate is rife over how the misprint happened, with theories that it could have been a deliberate act of industrial sabotage by a rival printer. But Jones has panned that rumour, saying it is far more likely the printers, who were operating in a cut-throat industry, were just cutting costs on copy-editors. The life of the New Zealand copy, which is owned by the Phil and Louise Donnithorne Family Trust, remains a mystery before it arrived in the country. Where many bibles contain detailed descriptions of family trees, dates, places, and recordings of births and deaths, this copy has just one illegible name. The copy was in relatively poor condition when it was re-discovered, with its cover missing, some water damage, and a few pages at the back gone for good. But it also has some unique features – it is one of a few copies that has the more decorative red as well as black ink and is a much more complete version that many others out there. Book and Paper Conservator Sarah Askey has conserved the item, painstakingly treating the work, fitting a new cover and preserving it for future generations. Askey has documented any little features that could help provide clues as to where the book had been – in between some pages she found plant remnants, human hair and textile fibres. “It was an awkward little thing to work around … and there was a lot of problem solving, but that was quite satisfying to do,” Askey said. The book has been now fully digitised and will become free to the public via a website in the coming months - something Jones hopes will help shed more light on the copy’s mysterious illegible name scrawled inside. “I’m hoping someone will come and say ‘Chris Jones, you’re an idiot, this is really obvious’, and I look forward to it.”",News/World news,Rare ‘Wicked’ bible that encourages adultery discovered in New Zealand,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/02/rare-wicked-bible-that-encourages-adultery-discovered-in-new-zealand
