12/22/2021,"An Indiana mom has says she has pulled her Black daughter out of a private school in Indianapolis after she alleged that students are bullying the teenager because of her race. They claim one of the acts of bigotry was daughter being sent a meme of a hand holding a stem of cotton bolls with a caption that read “when you ask a black girl to prom.” Local station WISH TV interviewed the pair about their harassment claims and their decision to transfer Gabby Portis, a 15-year-old, from the International School of Indiana, a $22K-per-year language school. Portis told the station that she’s heard the N-word used at the school and the racism she was experiencing made her look at herself, saying, “I just look in the mirror and be like, ‘I don’t see anything wrong with me.’” Her mother, Brittany Graves, said that as soon as she was made aware of the incidents, she immediately went to the school’s administration. She says that the school offered her daughter counseling and she declined, saying, “My daughter doesn’t need counseling.” She also claims the school suspended the offending students but when the suspensions ended the bullying intensified. Gabby claimed she started to receive text messages that made her concerned for her life. When asked if she thinks that her peers would consider themselves racist, Portis said that they would. “They just walk around saying it proudly,” she affirmed. She claimed an example of how casual the racism was between students emerged after one student asked Portis for money. A different student replied, “Why would you ask her for some money? She’s Black. Black people don’t have any money.’” Now, mom has pulled Portis out of school for good, stating that she doesn’t want her child to break down mentally or hurt herself after the racialized bullying. Until the transfer is official, Graves asked the school to allow Gabby to finish out the year through its virtual learning model set up during the coronavirus pandemic. The administration refused saying that the model is only used for students that stay at home for COVID-related reasons. The head of the school Elizabeth Head released this statement to the outlet: “The International School of Indiana (ISI) is an inclusive, diverse, and respectful community. ISI does not tolerate racial intolerance or other discriminatory conduct and takes reports of such alleged misconduct very seriously. Such reports are investigated promptly and thoroughly in order to gain a complete understanding of what allegedly happened. After investigating, ISI takes firm and appropriate steps to remedy and address any misbehavior. The nature of those steps depends upon the severity of what occurred.” “As ISI’s policy is that matters concerning students are confidential, the School is unable to provide details of specific situations.” But the private K-12 school has a student population of approximately 556 students, according to USA School Info. The site also reports that individuals who identify as white make up 70 percent of the student body. Blacks make up a little over 4 percent. Students who identify as mixed-race or who have multiple ethnicities total 12.8 percent of the population. Asians comprise 10 percent of the student body. Portis’ story mirrors those of other students who have left schools because of racism. Recently, Atlanta Black Star reported on a Rochester mom that pulled her sixth grader and eleventh grader out of the Pittsford school district in upstate New York. Victoria Love said in an interview that she and her spouse were tired of their children experiencing racial slurs at a place where they were supposed to be learning. “My husband and I made the tough decision to remove our students because we felt like five years was long enough,” she said last month. “A lot of the racist incidents do involve Black students, but it’s not only Black students.” One of the incidents that was filmed and placed on social media was of a white student with a toy gun who claimed that he wanted to kill Black people. Love says that the video frightened people, “The students at that particular high school were scared, and the point of someone making a video like that is to frighten and harm other people.” Five hours south in New Rochelle, New York, a teen baseball star named Tony Humphrey is leaving his school after he contends that a school staff exhibited racial bigotry toward him by stereotyping him as a thug. The assistant athletics director Bernard Mahoney asked the student why he was doing track, a sport he signed up for after his baseball season. When the young man said that he wanted to improve his speed, Mahoney stated that Blacks “gained that speed by running from the police.” Humphrey, who had already accepted an offer to go to Boston College after he graduates, shared that after that incident, he decided to transfer schools. “I decided to leave, because of my current situation, as I’m already committed. I’m already going to [college],” he shared. “I don’t feel like I have to stay at a program where they’re going to look at me different or feel uncomfortable at a place I have to go to Monday through Friday.” Humphrey was not alone in his protest. His former classmates, in protest of the teacher, organized a walkout. The school’s president, Brother Thomas R. Leto confirmed that the teacher has since resigned and added, “Iona Preparatory does not condone for its students and will not accept from its faculty and staff.” More news from our partners: ‘They Know How to Treat Their White Children’: High School Security Supervisor Not Terminated for Kneeling on Black Teen’s Neck, Instead He’s Assigned to New San Diego School Being Tuned Into Their Customers’ Needs, Up-and-Coming Brooklyn Tea Shop Did a Successful Pandemic Pivot Time To Count Cam Newton Out | It’s Been A Hall of Fame Ride, But It’s Over…Respectfully",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,"‘Students Are Proud to Be Racists’: 16-Year-Old Experiences Racism at Indiana High School, Mom Pulls Her Out Despite White Students Being Suspended",https://news.yahoo.com/students-proud-racists-16-old-160000635.html
12/22/2021,"Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who has gained hero status in parts of the conservative movement after he was acquitted in fatal shootings in Wisconsin last year, told a crowd of thousands in Phoenix on Monday that he was a scapegoat for a government effort to disarm the public. ""I think my trial was an example of them trying to come after our Second Amendment rights, our right to defend ourselves and trying to take our weapons,"" Rittenhouse, now 18, told a crowd of roughly 6,700 people at the Phoenix Convention Center. A jury found Rittenhouse not guilty of all counts against him in November following a widely-watched trial that exemplified the country's political polarization and raised questions about justice, equity and self-defense. Rittenhouse has made appearances on conservative media since then, and spoke Monday during a four-day gathering of conservatives put on by Turning Point USA, a student-focused movement that supports a free market and limited government. The nonprofit's political affiliate has worked to turn out support for President Donald Trump, and its founder, Charlie Kirk, has promoted false theories the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. The organizations are pro-Second Amendment rights. While Rittenhouse is feted by conservatives, the verdict also is viewed as a validation of vigilantism and prompted concern about an increase in violence at protests. The mood for Rittenhouse was celebratory. A crowd gathered in the hall hoping to snag a picture of him. Inside a cavernous convention hall, the audience chanted ""Kyle, Kyle, Kyle"" waiting for the teenager to come on stage — and then gave him a standing ovation. Rittenhouse, who sobbed when he testified during his own defense at the trial, smiled and joked on stage with Kirk and other panelists. The 45-minute discussion included one brief reference to one of the men killed in Kenosha over a year ago. While Rittenhouse has appeared on conservative media and visited with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, the appearance in Phoenix marks the first semi-public event for Rittenhouse, who just weeks ago told Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he wanted to ""lay low"" and that the polarization around his case was ""sickening."" ""You're a hero to millions, it's an honor to be able to have you,"" Kirk told Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse was not compensated for his appearance, according to Turning Point USA spokesman Andrew Kolvet. Rittenhouse has another tie to Arizona: He sparked controversy at Arizona State University, where he was briefly enrolled as a non-degree-seeking online student, and has expressed interest in attending school on the Tempe campus. That did not come up Monday, and a spokeswoman for Rittenhouse did not respond to a question about whether Rittenhouse would visit the campus while in Arizona. Rittenhouse was 17 years old when he fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, 28, during protests following the police shooting of Jacob Blake Jr. in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020. The police shooting, which left Blake partially paralyzed, rekindled racial justice protests that had embroiled some of America's largest cities during the summer of 2020. Prosecutors portrayed Rittenhouse as an untrained vigilante who brought an AR-15 rifle to the protests in Kenosha looking for trouble. Rittenhouse's defense team argued he acted in self-defense as others were attacking him. Rittenhouse has said he went to defend more private property from destruction following two nights of rioting in Kenosha. Conservative commentators and politicians have embraced Rittenhouse as a victim of mainstream media bias and a righteous example of the need for self-defense laws. Progressives said the jury's verdict was another example of white privilege and disparate treatment within the justice system. Rittenhouse suggested he will sue media outlets, saying ""accountability is coming, I'd be on the lookout,"" and prompting cheers from the audience. He said he took the stand ""to tell the world what happened in Kenosha, the truth, unlike with the prosecution tried to do. That's why I took the stand."" Alexander Sjogren, 23, of Pennsylvania, said he supported Rittenhouse and shared a fear that Democrats in Washington, D.C., wanted to take away Second Amendment rights. Sjogren draped his shoulders in a camouflage flag that hung to the floor. ""He presented the truth very well, and we're here to support him,"" Sjogren said. ""We're here to be there for him. We're here to pray for him. And we can't imagine what he's going through right now."" Trey Godzich, 19, of Mesa, said Rittenhouse's prosecution exemplified a malfunctioning justice system because it was a ""clear cut case"" of innocence. He said the justice system and media target white male gun owners in the U.S. ""They're not only going to go after Kyle, they're going to be coming after everyone,"" he said.

12/22/2021,"An Ohio man is accused of renting a crane and then using it to steal a 58-foot-long bridge from a park. Local police said 63-year-old David Bramley was arrested on Friday and charged with felony theft. Police said Bramley paid a local trucking company to get access to a crane. An Ohio man has been accused of renting a crane and using it to steal a 58-foot-long bridge from a public park, local police said on Monday. Akron, Ohio, police said 63-year-old David Bramley was arrested on Friday and charged with felony theft for allegedly stealing the bridge in November. The bridge was originally installed in Middlebury Run Park, but was later moved and stored in a field during a wetland restoration project, police said. But the bridge vanished by November 11. Police said Bramley, who worked in the area, paid a local trucking company to get access to a crane. The man then used the crane to load the bridge onto a vehicle and drive it to a nearby property. Bramley was identified as a person of interest in the case after police said they received multiple tips in connection with the case, and found the bridge partially disassembled while searching his property on Friday. Akron's Municipal Court confirmed to Insider that Bramley will be arraigned on the felony charge on December 23. No attorney for Bramley was listed with the court.
