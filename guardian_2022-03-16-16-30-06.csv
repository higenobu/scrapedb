3/16/2022,"The lawsuit that led to the high court ruling that publishers could be held liable for allegedly defamatory comments on their social media pages has been settled, leaving key legal questions unresolved. Dylan Voller had sued the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian, the Centralian Advocate, Sky News Australia and the Bolt Report over allegedly defamatory third party comments on their Facebook pages. The comments were in response to articles about Voller, whose mistreatment in the Northern Territory’s Don Dale youth detention centre led to a royal commission. Guardian Australia has confirmed with Voller’s lawyers and Nine that the case was settled last week. The terms of the settlement have not been disclosed. The high court judgment on a preliminary question in the case, handed down in September, found the media outlets could be held liable for comments by third parties on their Facebook pages. The judgment sent shockwaves through media companies in Australia, some of which responded by dedicating more resources for comment moderation on social media, or simply shut off their comments on some posts. CNN pulled its Facebook presence from Australia as a result. The Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, also announced he would shut off comments for some posts on Facebook as a result of the hearing. The High Court case was concerned only with whether the media companies could legally be held liable as publishers and the case was sent back to the lower court where the companies could have sought to mount defences to the publication including innocent dissemination. While Voller’s case has been settled, the high court ruling on liability for third-party comments stands. High-profile defamation lawyer Sue Chrysanthou revealed the Voller case had been settled on Tuesday during a Senate committee hearing on the government’s proposed Social Media (Anti-Trolling) bill. Chrysanthou said the outcome meant it was now impossible to know if the media companies could have won the case based on their defences in the supreme court. “The only question in the high court was whether the media organisations were publishers. They possibly still could have won that case if they demonstrated that their publication was innocent.” The bill, introduced in response to the September high court ruling, would shift liability from page owners to the social media platforms if those platforms do not assist those who have alleged to have been defamed to unmask anonymous commenters. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Chrysanthou described the proposed bill as “misconceived” and said it should be redrafted. “This bill is a violent assault on the tort of defamation by the commonwealth, for which no rational basis or reason has been provided,” she said. She said the bill is “providing immunity to large corporations that make money hosting forums where defamatory publications are made”. “These corporations do not need immunity. Just as with the local bird watching group, they can make a choice when it comes to the ongoing publication of defamatory material,” she said. “If they take it down after being put on notice, then they retain their innocent dissemination defences. If they choose to leave it up, then they are held accountable as they should be.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Over the course of the two hearings held by the Senate committee in the past week, most speakers have argued against the bill, stating it has nothing to do with cracking down on online trolling, and separately that the bill could ultimately make defamation cases more expensive with worse outcomes for those allegedly defamed. The Law Council of Australia has argued that changes should be reserved for outcomes of the working group of the attorneys general, to ensure legislation is the same across the federal, state and territory jurisdictions and not piecemeal. High-profile victims of online trolling Erin Molan and Nyadol Nyuon have also told the inquiry that defamation action was not feasible for most people due to the cost involved of mounting a legal case. Chrysanthou said the proposed bill would make the situation worse for people because with a shield from liability, page owners would no longer face defamation risk for refusing to remove defamatory comments, and the platforms would also have a defence if they ask the anonymous user to hand over their information even if they refuse. It would mean ultimately the comment would stay up unless the commenter decides to delete it.",News/Media,Dylan Voller defamation case settlement leaves legal questions unresolved,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/16/dylan-voller-defamation-case-settlement-leaves-legal-questions-unresolved
3/16/2022,"I’m hitting a brick wall with TNT’s passport delivery service. I was informed by HM Passport Office three months ago that my replacement passport had been dispatched. Since then, there’s been no attempt at a delivery. TNT’s customer service is fully automated and every time I call it informs me that the consignment is out for delivery “tomorrow”. There’s no option to speak to a human. The Passport Office says it’s unable to act unless TNT confirms it’s lost the passport. I have a trip to Italy booked for next month and face losing my money if I am unable to travel.JG, Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire Thousands have taken to Twitter and review websites to complain after waiting in vain for passports and residency permits. The Passport Office says that waiting times are currently about 10 weeks, but that’s for the document to be issued. Some complainants claim to have been waiting more than six months for TNT to make it to their door. The US-owned company, part of FedEx, signed a £77m three-year contract with the Home Office to deliver official travel documents in 2019, but Brexit and Covid appear to have wrought havoc. There are also concerns that the service does not allow recipients to live-track their item or log delivery instructions. A petition on Change.org, signed by more than 700 people, is calling for an inquiry into how TNT was selected by the Home Office and why service failings have not been investigated. SDD contacted me from Hampshire after his spouse visa was delivered to the wrong address without a signature, despite government rules requiring residency permits to be handed over in person after identity verification. The visa was reissued and delivered to the correct address, but again without being handed over in person. Londoner VH says that TNT erroneously claimed he was out on four occasions when it tried to deliver his biometric residency permit. “I checked my CCTV for the dates and times of the attempted deliveries shown on TNT’s tracker,” he says. “On the first occasion, the driver approached the property, took a photo and drove off without ringing the bell. The other times they didn’t even do that.” JG was contacted by TNT the day I alerted its press office, and his passport was miraculously discovered and delivered within 24 hours. TNT has apologised and blamed a surge in passport applications after Covid restrictions were eased at the end of last year. “This regrettably impacted our service levels,” it says. “We took a number of actions to restore service levels across our HM Passport Office network – including operational resources, extra team support and additional customer support resources – and we are currently operating within the service level requirements agreed with the Home Office.” TNT did not comment on allegations that drivers attempt deliveries without ringing the door bell, or that its helpline is unhelpful. Surprisingly, the Passport Office told me that, unlike with residency permits, a signature for passport deliveries is not part of its “secure delivery requirements” unless the mail box is communal. It would not specify what these “secure delivery requirements” are, or comment on whether it plans to renew the contract with TNT when it expires in July. It says: “We work closely with our UK delivery supplier and passports are being delivered within the required service level of 48 hours for standard deliveries.” Email your.problems@observer.co.uk.

3/16/2022,"In one room, tiny sheep tiptoe above a bunk bed and there are hoof-prints across the cement floor. In the room next door, carrier bags have been twisted into a light fixture in the fashion of a Hindu flower garland. Down the hall, lost mementoes including holiday postcards, bingo tickets and grainy photos decorate a glitter- and confetti-strewn resin floor. Welcome to what is claimed to be the UK’s first Art Hostel – a social enterprise project that has given artists free rein to design every inch of its premises from the ground up, in an effort to showcase grassroots creative talent from the UK and abroad. It’s the brainchild of East Street Arts, a charitable organisation that works with artists and residents in local communities. And the hostel isn’t in a hip enclave of east London, as you might expect, but in a deprived central suburb of Leeds. While there are several art-led hostels and hotels in Europe, and the legendary Carlton Arms art hotel in New York, this is the first in the UK to actually make the spaces themselves function as works of art. And the result is nothing less than magical – a symphony of imagination let loose on a grand scale. The hostel’s blank canvas is a building completed in 1894 that was once the presbytery for the old St Patrick’s church in Leeds’ Mabgate area. (The church itself is today used for storage by Opera North and Leeds Playhouse.) There are 12 rooms, each one grappling creatively with themes such as politics, history, environmental commentary and nostalgia. Staying the night here is like wandering through a dream. Given the freedom of the empty hostel as it prepared to open, I sneak into The Common(ing) (room 8) and wind up the handmade music box to hear it sing. I squint at the marine pollution maps created out of photos of washed-up footballs in Ocean Galaxy (room 6). I lie on the floor to take in the full glory of the interlocking fabric ceiling in The Wooly Ewe (room 9), which pays homage to sheep as a symbol of Leeds’ wool manufacturing heritage. The Art Hostel represents all that is shining in the Leeds creative scene right now, where grassroots organisations and entrepreneurs are passionate about creating a leading centre for the arts in the north of England. Profits from the hostel will be used to support other East Street Arts projects, in Leeds and beyond. “For the original 17 commissions available we had 218 applicants, and all of them were really great. It blew us away,” says Art Hostel general manager Rhian Aitken. In the end, they settled on 20, which included all the bedrooms, the kitchen, a commission for the volunteer staff quarters, a film-making project for the central stairwell and a motion-sensor-driven installation with reclaimed car headlights that mimics the sounds of insects climbing a wall. The Art Hostel started life as a pop-up on Kirkgate in 2016. Curious to see if such a concept could take off, East Street Arts initially intended to run the hostel for three years as an experiment. A disagreement with its landlord forced the hostel to close its doors in 2018. But in fewer than three years of operation it had taken 10,000 bookings. The business model had been vindicated, the travel demand was there, and so East Street Arts was encouraged to seek a forever home for the hostel. That was in 2019, but Brexit-related delays thwarted progress, and then Covid hit. Only recently, at the end of February 2022, has the Art Hostel finally managed to open. Recycling and ecology are at the heart of the project. “A lot of the old hostel stuff has been reused and recycled,” says Aitken. “One of the rooms is completely made from reclaimed wood, and even the flooring in the lounge and some of the bedrooms comes from a gym in Poland.” There’s also hot composting and a wormery; butts to conserve water; a landscaped garden designed to reduce traffic noise (the hostel is right next to the A64 ring road) and eco-friendly Earthborn Claypaints are used throughout. The fact that the hostel has found a permanent home in Mabgate makes perfect sense. This neighbourhood rubs shoulders with the Leeds Playhouse, BBC Radio offices and the Northern Ballet headquarters. And next door there’s East Street Arts’ Convention House, which started life as a nunnery but is now a multipurpose creative space with studios, residency accommodation for artists, and tech facilities including an ecological darkroom that acts as a research facility for sustainable photography practices. “For a lot of years there wasn’t any funding [for the arts],” says Aitken. “So Karen Watson and Jon Wakeman [East Street Arts’ founders] got together and created a space with a communal area, so everyone could get together, show work and mix with each other, and have that social aspect as well as having their own studios. And that was unique.” Aitken says the reason East Street Arts and the Art Hostel have flourished is because of the Leeds “DIY attitude” to the arts. “This whole area has become a community hub for creatives,” says Aitken. Down the road there are now photo labs and more art and dance studios. At the bottom of the hill there’s MAP (Music and Arts Production) Charity, an alternative education provider working with young people who are unable to access mainstream schooling. “Mabgate and Lincoln Green was one of the most deprived areas in Europe at one point. But it’s got this wonderfully diverse community,” says Aitken. East Street Arts is now involved in creating an artist-led community neighbourhood plan for Mabgate, which will be the first of its kind in the country. The plan will help give local residents, businesses, schools, community groups and charities a say in how the area develops and regenerates – with a dose of creative input. “It’s not about gentrification. It’s not about the artists coming in and making things pretty; it’s about actually giving the people a voice and helping them make decisions about what’s happening to them and their families,” she says. And the hostel itself is also a community effort: one of the rooms, the Ziggy Wingle (room 2), was a collaboration between Leeds artist Alison Smith and local Shakespeare Primary School, resulting in splashes of primary colours, children’s drawings embedded in the window architraves and a huge, playful wall of movable parts. Plans are already afoot to take the Art Hostel concept to other cities in the UK. “There are lots of emerging artists, but also lots of jobbing artists who are there every day just doing their thing, making their creative lives, and it’s great that we can feature them and give them the opportunity to do something really, really visual,” says Aitken. The Art Hostel has 12 rooms, consisting of doubles, twins and bunk rooms bookable for groups of six to eight, starting at £50 per room per night, including breakfast",Lifestyle/Travel,Pillow and a palette: Leeds’ Art Hostel is a creative’s dream,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/mar/16/leeds-art-hostel-is-a-creatives-dream-yorkshire-rooms
3/16/2022,"Are you sitting comfortably? Then we’ll begin. Once upon a time there was a harried new parent (me, I’m talking about me) who sat down and read her baby a book. Then she read the baby another book and then she read the baby another book etc, etc. That’s what you’re supposed to do when you have a kid, isn’t it? You read them books so they can develop a passion for literature and grow up to have an impecunious future in the arts. As far as I can tell, my 10-month-old hasn’t developed a passion for literature yet. Unless you count putting books in her mouth, squealing, and then throwing them across the room as a “passion”. But I’ve certainly learned a lot from all this new reading material. And, because sharing is caring (a big theme in kids’ books), I’m going to share these learnings with you. Number one: it’s time we had a serious conversation about Dear Zoo. Everyone loves this classic baby book – we were gifted FIVE copies of it – but the central theme is disturbing. A small child keeps sending animals back to the zoo because they’re not quite up to snuff? I’m sorry, but I strongly suspect that book helped raise a generation of Karens of all genders. It might as well be called Dear Zoo (I Want To Speak To The Manager). My second big learning is that celebrities really need to stop writing kids’ books. By my calculations, 93.2% of celebrities, from Whoopi Goldberg to Chelsea Clinton to Jimmy Fallon to George Galloway(!!) to Kelly Clarkson to Mike Pence’s rabbit have authored a kids’ book. Most of these are either terrible or terribly unimaginative. Here, for example, is a sample quote from one of Fallon’s creations: “This is baby’s nose, these are baby’s fingers, these are baby’s toes.” Must be nice to be famous! You can get paid a gazillion bucks to rhyme nose with toes. I guess that’s just how it goes. Money makes money; when you’re rich, you keep stacking up the zeros. (Where’s my book contract, eh?). Which moves me on to my final learning: everyone seems to think they can write a great kids’ book, but very few people actually can. Writing a great children’s book isn’t child’s play, it’s serious work.  Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,What have I learned from my child’s bedtime stories?

3/16/2022,"Australian researchers claim to have made a “giant leap” in lifting the efficiency of electrolysers, bringing forward the time when green hydrogen will be competitive with fossil fuels as an energy source. Hysata, a company using technology developed at the University of Wollongong, said its patented capillary-fed electrolysis cells achieve 95% efficiency, meaning little wastage, beating by about one-quarter the levels of current technology. The achievement, published in the peer-reviewed Nature Communication journal today, could see the Morrison government’s so-called hydrogen stretch goal of $2 a kilogram to make the fuel competitive reached as soon as 2025, the Hysata chief executive, Paul Barrett, said. “We’ve gone from 75% [efficiency] to 95% – it’s really a giant leap for the electrolysis industry,” Barrett said. Renewable energy from sources such as wind and solar is making big inroads into the power sector, supplying more than a third of eastern Australia’s electricity in the final three months of 2021. However, decarbonising industry and some transport, such as trucking, is likely to be tougher unless fuels such as hydrogen become much cheaper. Gerry Swiegers, Hysata’s chief technology officer and a UoW professor, said electrolysis – which uses electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen – had been around for two centuries with mostly only incremental improvements in processing. The central challenge was to reduce the electrical resistance within the electrolysis cell. Much like a smart phone battery warming as it charges, resistance wasted energy in a regular cell as well as often requiring additional energy for cooling. “What we did differently was just to start completely over and to think about it from a very high level,” Swiegers said. “Everyone else was looking at improving materials or an existing design.” With the help of two PhD researchers – Aaron Hodges and Anh Linh Hoang – the small team used readily available materials to develop a thin sponge-like membrane to suck the water up between two electrodes. The avoidance of creating bubbles was also key. “So a combination of that wicking membrane and that bubble-free operation resulted in inherently low resistance,” Barrett said. Hydrogen could be produced using 41.5 kilowatt-hours of electricity per kilogram. “For hydrogen producers, this will significantly reduce both the capital and operational costs to produce green hydrogen,” he said, adding the efficiency levels achieved were “the best in the world”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning From an initial concept in 2019, the research has advanced quickly. With $4.25m from UK-based IP Group and $750,000 from Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corp, Hysata is now looking to begin a pilot manufacturing site of electrolysis plates – each 250mm in diameter – by the end of 2023. “We want to help Australia build core electrolyser technology,” Barrett said, adding the plan would be to build a plant capable of producing one gigawatt of electrolysers a year. Similar-sized plants for elsewhere in the country and beyond would follow as the production techniques were mastered. Hysata is hiring more staff to add to its 20-strong team, with a plan for a fundraising announcement in the second half of 2022, Barrett said.

3/16/2022,"The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has taken a swing at Rupert Murdoch’s national broadsheet the Australian, declaring it is “extraordinarily disrespectful” to use the appellation “mean girls” to describe “strong, articulate, principled women” like Penny Wong, Katy Gallagher and Kristina Keneally. The blast followed the publication on Wednesday of an article chronicling alleged internal disagreements between members of Labor’s Senate team and the late senator Kimberley Kitching, who died suddenly of a heart attack last week at the age of 52. The article claimed the disagreements left Kitching feeling isolated. The news story was headlined: “How Labor’s ‘mean girls’ ostracised Kimberley Kitching”. It appears to attribute the “mean girls” reference either to Kitching directly, or one of her friends. Wednesday’s report asserts that Kitching “and some of her supporters” referred to Gallagher, Keneally and Wong as “the mean girls”. Albanese told journalists in Brisbane he found it “astonishing” and a decades-long “throwback” that a sexist description would be deployed in 2022 to describe female frontbenchers. The federal opposition leader noted he was campaigning in Queensland on Wednesday with colleagues Ed Husic and Anthony Chisholm and “we have never been described as mean boys, and people should think about that”. Albanese said on Wednesday his colleagues were still mourning Kitching’s “tragic loss.” “It was sudden,” he said. “It was not expected. Her funeral isn’t until Monday. Can people be a bit respectful at this point in time?” Asked whether there was cause to investigate whether or not the Labor party had a “mean girls” culture, Albanese said: “Seriously, have a bit of respect. The funeral is on Monday”. Kitching – a player in Labor’s Victorian right faction, and a long time friend and factional ally of Labor’s former leader, Bill Shorten – was facing a battle to secure preselection to remain in the Senate at the coming election. Because of an extraordinary federal intervention in the Victorian branch of the Labor party, triggered by a significant branch stacking scandal, preselections in the state were being determined by the national executive. Speaking after Kitching’s death, Shorten saidthe senator had been under considerable stress. “I’m not a coroner, I can’t tell you why this woman at 52 was taken from us, but I have no doubt the stress of politics and the machinations in the back rooms had its toll,” he said last week. “She’s a very strong person. She could give as good as she could get. But you take it all home with you, don’t you? Stress is like invisible coats of paint. It’s got to be having its impact. And she was greatly stressed.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Wong, Keneally and Gallagher are all significant supporters of Albanese. Albanese said on Wednesday Kitching was “someone who I had respect for”. He said he had appointed her as an assistant shadow minister, assisting Shorten in the shadow portfolio of disabilities. “She worked closely with Bill and I thought that was entirely appropriate”. Wong, Labor’s Senate leader, told journalists: “Senator Kitching has passed away and that was tragic and shocking and many in the Labor family are grieving and her loved ones are grieving”. “I am simply not going to engage in commentary about some of the allegations which have been raised and even if I and others disagree with them”. Gallagher told the ABC: “Many of the assertions in that article are not true from my point of view, but I don’t think it is respectful for us to enter into commentary or disagreements about particular aspects of [the story] at this point in time”. Campaigning in Perth, Scott Morrison told reporters Kitching was “unique” and a “true patriot” who had forged many friendships with Liberal colleagues in the pursuit of her policy interests in foreign affairs, defence and intelligence. Morrison said he was not in a position to confirm the report in The Australian, but he said he expected Albanese to take any claims of internal strong-arming “seriously”.",News/Australia news,‘Extraordinarily disrespectful’: Albanese hits back after Labor senators dubbed ‘mean girls’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/extraordinarily-disrespectful-albanese-hits-back-after-labor-senators-dubbed-mean-girls
3/16/2022,"Good Wednesday morning to you from me, Warren Murray. The US Senate has passed a unanimous resolution condemning Vladimir Putin as a war criminal – a rare show of unity in the deeply divided congress – as the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the Russian side were sounding “more realistic” in negotiations to end the war. Talks are set to resume via video link today. Earlier, Zelenskiy acknowledged that Ukraine would not become a Nato member, in a significant concession. As the war approaches its third week, heavy shelling of Ukraine’s cities has continued. The Ukraine ministry of defence said the “worst situation remains in the area of Mariupol, where the opponent tries to block the city in the western and eastern outskirts of the city”. There have been reports of Russian troops seizing a hospital in Mariupol and taking about 500 people hostage. Leaders of three European Union countries – Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia – met with Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Tuesday, arriving by train in a bold show of support amid the danger. The Czech prime minister, Petr Fiala, told Ukrainians: “Europe stands with you … The main goal of our visit and the main message of our mission is to say to our Ukrainian friends that they are not alone.” The leader of Poland’s ruling party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said an international peacekeeping mission should be sent to operate in Ukraine. Joe Biden has signed off on $13.6bn in US aid and Zelenskiy is due to address the US Congress today. Meanwhile Nato commanders will be meeting in Brussels where they are expected to draw up plans for new ways to deter Russia, including more troops and missile defences in eastern Europe. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, is expected to plead for more weapons from individual Nato countries. Keep up with further developments at our live blog. Arbiter end – Silicon Valley executives will no longer be the “supreme arbiters” of online speech, according to the culture secretary. Nadine Dorries said “unelected” tech leaders had become some of the most powerful people in the world due to a lack of robust regulation, which would change under the revised online safety bill to be published on Thursday. It requires platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and TikTok to prevent proliferation of illegal content such as child sexual abuse and terrorist material; and mandates the biggest tech firms to protect adults from legal but harmful content, such as cyberbullying. Social media platforms face hefty fines for breaches. There are protections for journalistic content and content of “democratic importance”. Dorries said: “We would never pursue legislation that threatens freedom of expression … nor can we maintain the current status quo, where a handful of west coast execs are the supreme arbiters of online speech.” Midweek catch-up > Hopes are high that British-Iranian dual nationals Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori could be freed and allowed to return to London within days under a deal in which the UK agrees to repay a £400m debt and release an Iranian prisoner. > Few teachers are aware that equalities legislation applies to their school’s policies on hair, despite high-profile court cases affecting black students who have been penalised or excluded for their hairstyles, a survey has found. > Spain’s Nuclear Safety Council (CSN) has appealed for people to be on the lookout for a soil-testing kit containing radioactive material that was stolen from a van in the Madrid region. > New Zealand is reopening its borders.

The child is now in therapy and self-harming, according to family members’ statements. Details of her treatment emerged in a review initiated by Hackney council after the incident in December 2020. Police had been called by teachers who told the review they believed she was smelling strongly of cannabis and suspected she was carrying drugs. None were found during the subsequent search. The Metropolitan police has apologised for what a senior officer described as “truly regrettable” treatment. A separate Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) report is nearing completion. Tomb find – Several tombs and a leaden sarcophagus likely dating from the 14th century have been uncovered by archaeologists at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris as reconstruction continues after its devastating 2019 fire. It is thought the coffin was made for a senior dignitary in the 1300s – the century after the cathedral’s construction. The team used a mini endoscopic camera to look inside: “You can glimpse pieces of fabric, hair and a pillow of leaves on top of the head, a well known phenomenon when religious leaders were buried,” said Christophe Besnier, the lead archaeologist. “The fact that these plant elements are still inside means the body is in a very good state of conservation.” When Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003, he transformed the club’s fortunes and ushered in a new era of billionaire owners in the Premier League.
