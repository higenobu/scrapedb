4/17/2022,"A kindergarten class in Michigan accidentally drank tequila during snack time. A student brought in Jose Cuervo's ready-to-drink margaritas and the children thought it was juice. One of the kids ""felt woozy"" and a ""little dizzy"" after having four or five sips, a parent said. A kindergarten class in Michigan accidentally consumed tequila during snack time, Fox 2 Detroit reported. One of the kids brought a bottle of ready-to-drink Jose Cuervo margaritas to Grand River Academy Livonia in her backpack, according to the news outlet. Several students drank it. One kindergartner ""felt woozy"" and a ""little dizzy"" after having four or five sips from a Dixie cup, a parent told Fox 2 Detroit. The kindergartners who drank the margaritas told their parents they thought it was juice. But the kindergartner who initially brought the drink in knew it was alcoholic, Fox 2 Detroit reported. ""The girl poured it in her cup and she drank it and the girl ended up telling her what it is, and she went and told the teacher there is liquor in this cup, and the teacher gave her a funny face,"" Dominique Zanders, a mother of one of the kindergartners, told Fox 2 Detroit. In a statement, the school said faculty called poison control when they learned the children had been drinking margaritas, according to Fox 2 Detroit. ""While we try to keep an eye on everything our students bring to school, that's simply not possible,"" the school said in its statement. ""It's unfortunate that these types of adult beverages can be easily mistaken for child-friendly drinks."" ""I'm not sure if they are short-staffed or whatever, it shouldn't have happened,"" Zanders told Fox 2 Detroit. The school said parents were notified immediately and told that their kids were okay. Outraged parents are blaming the child's own parents. ""If your child knows what it is, nothing wrong with it. But they should know not to touch it,"" Alexis Smith told Fox 2 Detroit. ""That it's not for kids."" ""I had a small conversation with my daughter — nothing big — and she told me the girl knew it was liquor,"" Smith said. Grand River Academy Livonia did not immediately respond to Insider's request to comment.

4/17/2022,"President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden had a joint income of more than $600,000 last year. Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband earned almost triple, with more than $1.65 million income. The tax returns were released by the White House on Friday. President Joe Biden and his wife Jill Biden earned a combined income of $610,702 last year, according to their joint income tax returns released on Friday. Joe Biden's presidential salary was $378,333, slightly below the typical $400,000 annual pay because he entered office on January 20. First Lady Jill Biden, who teaches English and writing at Northern Virginia Community College, earned $67,116. The couple paid an effective federal income tax rate of 24.6%, which came to $150,439 and another $30,765 in their home state of Delaware. The Bidens made charitable donations totaling $17,394, which included $5,000 to the Beau Biden Foundation, set up in the name of the president's deceased son. The previous year the couple reported making a similar figure of $607,336 in income. Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband Douglas Emhoff reported earning $1.65 million last year, according to their joint income tax returns. Unlike the Bidens, most of their income did not come from their salaries. Harris reported earning $452,664 from her work as a writer, and the couple earned more than $319,000 from the sale of a condominium in San Francisco. Harris' vice presidential salary came to $215,548, slightly lower than the typical $230,700 salary due to her taking office on January 20. Her husband, Doug Emhoff, earned $164,740 from his job teaching at Georgetown Law. He also reported earning $582,543 for his work as a lawyer at the law firms DLA Piper and Venable, which he left in 2021 when Harris took office. They paid $523,371 in federal income tax at an effective federal income tax rate of 31.6%. The couple donated $22,100 to charity, according to the documents. ""With this release, the President has shared a total of 24 years of tax returns with the American public, once again demonstrating his commitment to being transparent with the American people about the finances of the commander in chief,"" the White House said in a statement. Biden's move contrasts with his predecessor Donald Trump, who broke with decades of tradition by refusing to release his tax records. In 2020, The New York Times obtained decades of Trump's tax reports. In 11 of the 18 years that were examined by the paper, Trump paid $0 in federal income taxes.

4/17/2022,"An estimated 160 million tax returns are expected to be filed this year, according to the IRS, and so far, the tax season has been running smoothly. The tax agency has processed 6.6% more returns compared with a year ago, though it has received 2.1% fewer returns so far from taxpayers. And according to Ken Corbin, wage and investment division commissioner and chief taxpayer experience officer for the IRS, the tax agency is well on its way to improve taxpayers' experience for the 2023 tax year. “So far we’ve received over 91 million individual returns this year and we’ve processed 89 million returns,” Corbin told Yahoo Finance Live. “What’s great about that is that we’re seeing that more taxpayers are getting our message. We’ve seen about a 96% electronic filing rate, which is outstanding.” The IRS is still grappling with an unprecedented paper backlog of millions of unprocessed returns – some dating back to last year. As of March 31, the tax agency had 2.7 million unprocessed individual tax returns dating back to 2021 and 2.3 million unprocessed returns from the calendar year 2022. Under normal circumstances, the IRS has a backlog of 1 million unprocessed returns entering a filing season. To reduce the chances of further delays, the IRS urged taxpayers to electronically file their returns this year. The agency has also doubled down on measures to hire and reassign workers to get through the pile of unprocessed paper returns. The IRS also redesigned its online website IRS.gov to make it more user-friendly so taxpayers could navigate and find information easily. The tax agency also added a new individual account that allows taxpayers to keep track of their personal information and tax status. “The pandemic has really given us an opportunity to sit back and think about the journeys of the taxpayer as they interact with the IRS,” Corbin said. “It’s an opportunity to be innovative but to also bring cohesion around how we administer the taxes… we’ve introduced new technology like voice and chat bots on our phone as well as IRS.gov. And we’ve implemented taxpayer experience days, where taxpayers can come into our offices and talk with us [on the weekend].” If you have yet to file your tax return this season, and want to avoid any substantial delays with your refund, you should file electronically. National Taxpayer Advocate Erin Collins recently told Yahoo Money that filing a paper return could delay your tax processing for 10 months or longer. This can be a real set back if you’re waiting on a refund or the remaining portion – if not the complete amount — of your Child Tax Credit. “Number one, file electronically and use direct deposit – there are lots of options out there, including our IRS free-file program,” said Corbin. Folks that received an advanced CTC payment last year or collected unemployment were encouraged to use the IRS.gov personal account to check how much they received in aid before filing, so their returns wouldn’t be held for a manual review, said the IRS. The IRS has implemented a variety of programs to help individuals file their taxes as zero cost. “More taxpayers seem to be seeking help in filing their returns, whether they are going to a tax professional or even using our Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program, where we offer free tax prep for taxpayers,” said Corbin. VITA programs are run each year by IRS-certified volunteers to ensure lower-income households can get the tax preparation and services they need to file accurate tax returns and get their refund. VITA resources can also help non-filers claim tax credits they may be eligible for, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit, and any stimulus checks they may not have received. Still, the IRS recognizes that there is still work to be done to avoid the jammed paper backlogs it is currently contending with. “We have to be sensitive to those taxpayers whose returns have not been processed – it’s critical to them,” Corbin said. “There are refunds in those returns and there are other reasons why people need those returns processed either for financial aid for college students or to obtain a loan. What this means for these taxpayers is that their experience has been a challenging one. But at the IRS, we’re all hands on deck. We have a plan so that we can get better than healthy by the time we get to the 2023 season.” Gabriella is a personal finance reporter at Yahoo Money. Follow her on Twitter @__gabriellacruz.
