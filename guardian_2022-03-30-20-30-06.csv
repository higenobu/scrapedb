3/30/2022,"Germany moved closer to gas rationing on Wednesday, after activating an emergency plan designed to help it cope with any disruption in supplies from Russia. Amid fears of a looming showdown with Vladimir Putin over gas flows, Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, convened a crisis team and warned consumers and businesses to reduce consumption, telling them “every kilowatt hour counts”. Europe’s largest economy is also one of the EU members most reliant on supplies from Kremlin-controlled reserves, making it particularly vulnerable if the taps are turned off. The European Union has pledged to slash its use of Russian gas by two-thirds before the end of the year but there are concerns that the Kremlin could pre-empt the plan. Putin has demanded that Europe and the US pay for gas exports in roubles, a retaliation against the west for imposing crippling sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The rejection by G7 nations of his demand has created an impasse that has put Europe on alert for a gas supply crunch. Habeck said he had activated the “early warning phase” of an existing gas emergency plan, meaning that a crisis team from the economics ministry, regulatory officials and the private sector will monitor imports and storage. “We must increase precautionary measures to be prepared for an escalation on the part of Russia,” said Habeck. “With the declaration of the early warning level, a crisis team has convened.” Habeck said supplies were safeguarded for the time being but urged consumers and companies to reduce consumption, saying that “every kilowatt hour counts”. If supplies fall short, Germany’s network regulator can ration gas, with industry being first in line for cuts. That threatens to send shockwaves through Germany’s heavily industrialised, export-led economy, with sectors from automotive to chemicals highly reliant on flows of gas. Preferential treatment would be given to private households, hospitals and other critical institutions. Half of Germany’s 41.5 million households are heated by natural gas, while industrial users accounted for a third of the 100bn cubic metres (bcm) of national demand in 2021. Russia is Germany’s main gas supplier, accounting for 40% of imports in the first quarter of 2022. Berlin has pledged to end its energy dependency on Moscow but it will not achieve full independence before mid-2024, according to Habeck. In France, the head of the energy regulator said the country should not encounter any supply issues and said there was no need to panic. “Everything will be fine, the gas storage facilities are well filled, we’ll make it through the winter,” Jean-François Carenco, head of the CRE, told BFM TV. Russia is also a major supplier of diesel to European countries. Diesel rationing is likely in Germany and could even happen in the UK, Amrita Sen, a founding partner and the chief oil analyst at the research consultancy Energy Aspects, told the Treasury committee earlier this month.",News/Business,Germany close to gas rationing as it activates emergency fuel plan,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/30/germany-close-to-gas-rationing-as-it-activates-emergency-fuel-plan
3/30/2022,"If you’ve tried to order lateral flow tests online in recent days, you’ve probably encountered the message: “Sorry, there are no more home delivery slots for these tests right now.” Unless, that is, you’re Dave McNally or one of his 16.3k Twitter followers. In late December, he wrote a software application that would rapidly fill out the form to the point where it became clear if any tests were in stock – and then share that information via the Twitter account UK @LFT_alert. The insights he has gained shed new light on why so many people have been struggling to order tests: batches are only released a couple of times a day, at specific (and unadvertised) times, and stock is often exhausted within the hour. With the government announcing the end of free Covid testing for most people in England on Friday, the demand for LFTs (lateral flow tests) means they are increasingly snapped up within minutes of becoming available. “On Monday evening, it was only 45 minutes, and there was an afternoon session of 18 minutes – so, only an hour and three minutes in total,” said McNally. “People are going to be wasting their time on the site trying to order the damned things if they don’t know the time slot. “That’s why I’ve made a point of posting quite regularly, ‘it’s always 8 o’clock pm. Tell people, because not everyone’s on Twitter’.” He added: “I think demand has really picked up this week. I wouldn’t be surprised if on Thursday we see a five minute window or something stupid like that.” McNally, 46, from Bristol, started the project after struggling to get hold of any LFTs due to high demand post-Christmas. As a web developer, and self-confessed “data-nerd”, it was relatively easy for him to write a program to automate the form-filling process, allowing him to get hold of tests as soon as they were back in stock. The next day, he noticed someone on Twitter complaining of exactly the same problem: “I thought, it’s a bit selfish to have just done this for myself, when there’s probably thousands of people having exactly the same difficulties, and I could just create a Twitterbot [to share that information],” McNally said. Launched on 31 December, the bot rapidly accumulated a loyal fanbase, as people shared and retweeted its vital information. According to McNally’s data, those initial problems with LFT supply ended on 10 January. But then in early March, people started messaging him to say they were once again struggling to access tests. McNally discovered the bot had stopped working, but it was back up and running by 13 March. “In came the stock at 8pm, and lasted 2.5 hours. Ever since then, it’s been 8pm each day, plus sometimes 7am, sometimes 12pm, sometimes 2pm – but always 8pm,” he said. There are regional differences: Scotland only started running out of tests during the past week – but their window of availability appears to be growing shorter each day. Wales and Northern Ireland always seem to have plenty of tests available, McNally said. He has received a lot of grateful messages on Twitter, “which is lovely”, but he has also been alarmed by some of the comments – particularly from health professionals, saying they’ve also struggled to get hold of tests. “If you’re working the same shifts every day, you can’t necessarily get online to get an 8pm slot. That’s kind of scary,” he said. “If you’re trying at certain times of day, you’ll never get any.”",News/World news,Bristol web developer creates bot to help people get lateral flow tests,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/30/bristol-web-developer-creates-twitter-bot-covid-lateral-flow-tests
3/30/2022,"Executives at the British aviation services company John Menzies have accepted a £571m takeover deal from a Kuwaiti rival, after rebuffing three previous offers. A subsidiary of Agility Public Warehousing had made the bid more than a month ago, which was conditional at the time, although the John Menzies board said it would accept the offer. The Edinburgh-based company, which offers services ranging from cargo and baggage-handling to passenger check-in and plane de-icing and refuelling, told the stock market on Wednesday that it had agreed the terms of the deal. Agility previously held a 19% stake in Menzies, which it built after first approaching the company. Its final offer price means Menzies’ shareholders will receive 608p a share, which the company said represented an 81% premium to the closing share price on 8 February, the day before it received an initial takeover offer from Agility. Menzies will be combined with Agility’s National Aviation Services (NAS) unit, an aviation services provider that counts airlines such as British Airways, Air France, KLM, Emirates and Qatar Airways among its customers. Aviation analysts said the takeover deal would allow Agility, which is listed on the Kuwait stock exchange and the Dubai financial market, to create the world’s largest airport services firm, according to the number of countries it operates in, as international air travel recovers from the impact of the pandemic. The combined company is expected to have about 35,000 employees and a presence at more than 250 airports in 57 countries, turning around more than 600,000 aircraft a year. Menzies’ chief executive, Philipp Joeinig, will become the boss of the combined group. The current NAS chief executive will take up the role of chair. Joeinig called Menzies “an outstanding business with a long and rich history” and said the Agility offer represented “a fair and recommendable price for shareholders which recognises Menzies’ future prospects. “The board of Menzies applauds the work that the Menzies management team have done to steer the business through the challenging impacts of the pandemic and position the business for continued future growth and the next evolution in its journey,” added Joeinig, who has more than 2.5m Menzies shares and should make just under £15.5m from the deal. Hassan El-Houry, the NAS group chief executive, said Menzies shareholders would receive a premium for supporting the transaction. “This deal creates a world leader in airport services and unlocks value for all stakeholders,” he said. “Customers will benefit from Menzies’ operational excellence at more airports around the world and will be able to choose from a broader product offering.” This latest development tops Menzies’ incredible corporate story, which goes back to an Edinburgh bookshop founded in 1833. The business later added newspaper distribution and a chain of newsagents, as well as other bookshops, before opening its first outlet in an airport in 1948. Menzies expanded into cargo handling in 1987, and in recent decades sold its retail operation and newspaper business in order to focus on aviation services.",News/Business,John Menzies accepts takeover bid from Kuwaiti aviation services rival Agility,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/30/john-menzies-accepts-takeover-bid-from-kuwaiti-aviation-services-rival-agility
3/30/2022,"Abrunch classic that deserves to be better known, much like the early 20th-century novelist it’s named after. Though Bennett himself seems to have enjoyed the dish as a post-theatre supper, this silky, smoky tangle of eggs, cheese and haddock is so ridiculously, deliciously rich that it’s best consumed well before bedtime … though I won’t judge you if you want to go back to bed afterwards. Prep 5 minInfuse 30 minCook 35 minServes 2 ½ onion200ml milk130ml double cream1 bay leaf½ tsp peppercornsA grating of nutmeg200g smoked white fish fillets (eg, sustainable smoked haddock or pollock)35g butter25g flour4 eggs, plus 2 egg yolks20g parmesan, finely grated1 tbsp chopped chives, to finish Note that, depending on the size of your frying pan, you can make two individual omelettes or one big one to share. If possible, use an ovenproof one that can go under the grill. If you want to get ahead, make the recipe up to the end of step 5 the night before, and gently reheat the sauce the next day. Roughly chop the onion, then put it, the milk and 100ml of the cream in a small pan with the bay leaf, peppercorns and a grating of nutmeg. Bring to a simmer, then take off the heat and leave to infuse for 30 minutes. Strain the infused milk, discarding the solids, then pour the milk back into the pan. Bring the milk to a simmer, then add the fish, cutting it up as necessary so as much of it as possible is submerged. Traditionally, this dish is made with smoked haddock, but any cold-smoked white fish will work, so use whatever is available and most sustainable locally; I’ve even been known to make it with kippers. Take the pan off the heat, cover and leave to sit for about five minutes (longer if the fish is particularly thick), until the fish is cooked enough so it flakes easily. Lift out the fish with a slotted spoon, peel off the skin, if necessary, then flake the flesh into large chunks. Pour the milk into a jug. Melt 25g butter in a small pan (use the same one, to save on the washing-up) over a medium-low heat, then whisk in the flour and cook, stirring, for a minute or so. Gradually whisk in the infused milk, then cook, still stirring, until the sauce thickens to the consistency of double cream. Take the pan off the heat. Whisk the egg yolks with the remaining cream, then very gradually whisk this into the sauce. Stir in the flaked fish, then season to taste – you probably won’t need much salt, because smoked fish is quite salty already, but you may wish to add a little more pepper or nutmeg. Heat the grill. Whisk the four eggs with a little seasoning, and heat half the remaining butter in a medium omelette pan (or all of it in a big frying pan, if making an omelette to share) over a medium-high flame. When the foam subsides, pour in half the eggs (or all of them, if making a large one) and shake the pan to cover the base. Leave the eggs until they begin to set and bubble, then use a fork to draw the sides of the omelette into the centre, at the same time tilting the pan to move any runny egg to the sides. When the omelette is almost set, but still a little loose in the middle, take the pan off the heat, add half (or all) the fishy sauce and top with the grated cheese. Put the omelette under the hot grill until lightly golden and bubbling on top. If you’re making two omelettes, tip the first one on to a heatproof plate and keep it somewhere warm while you make the second one. Top with the chopped chives and serve immediately – I usually just put the pan on the table and tuck in.

3/30/2022,"In an otherwise reflective essay by Prof Devi Sridhar (Why can’t some scientists just admit they were wrong about Covid?, 24 March), I was surprised to learn that I held views I do not hold. Early in 2020, I wrote a piece asking for more data, but this certainly did not “mock” those who were worried about Covid-19. I was worried myself. I remain concerned about both Covid-19 and our frequently non-evidence-based responses to it. I have published dozens of peer-reviewed Covid-19-related papers (collected here under “Projects”). Like all science, I expect those papers must have many weaknesses. I always look for questioning scholars, like Prof Sridhar, to improve on them. However, I fear that isolating single sentences out of context, distorting the meaning of others and using misleading slogans (eg “Covid-as-flu”) can’t promote scientific precision or help society. I celebrate the scientific progress made since 2020. I wasn’t “cynical” about vaccines and treatments, but elated to see effective interventions developed faster than most scientists expected. We should promote their evidence-based use. However, my ignorance on many matters still remains large. Both before and during the pandemic, I have repeatedly discussed my own mistakes. Prof Sridhar has previously pushed for Sars-CoV-2 eradication; opposed opening schools; promoted draconian lockdowns; even advocated cancelling the Olympics. It reflects the nature of research during uncertainty that her spirited positions evolve as well.Prof John PA IoannidisStanford University",News/World news,I did not ‘mock’ those who were worried about Covid-19 | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/30/i-did-not-mock-those-who-were-worried-about-covid-19
3/30/2022,"A leading UK government adviser has criticised the “disgraceful” profiteering of some companies that sought contracts to provide personal protective equipment and Covid testing during the pandemic. Speaking on Wednesday at a Royal Society conference on the science of Covid, Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University and the government’s life sciences adviser, said the behaviour of certain companies in the middle of the crisis was “extremely unacceptable”. The government has come under heavy criticism for handing out billions of pounds-worth of contracts without proper scrutiny and operating a “VIP lane” for PPE suppliers that was ruled as illegal in January. Meanwhile, the market for commercial Covid tests ballooned, leading some critics to warn that a lack of oversight was bound to lead to unreliable testing, as occurred when the Immensa lab wrongly told more than 40,000 people they were uninfected when they may have had the virus. Bell told the meeting there was “a lot of profiteering” among companies offering tests and PPE. “I think this is disgraceful,” he said. “If you went into the testing space or the PPE space, there were a lot of people roaming around just trying to make money. And that, in the context of a major humanitarian crisis, was really, extremely unacceptable.” While Bell praised the UK scientific community for getting the country “out of a lot of trouble over the last two years”, particularly with vaccines, data analysis and the rapid assessment of drugs to treat patients, he said the UK’s response to the pandemic had been poor in many ways. “I think it’s fair to say our pandemic preparedness was pretty lamentable. Our public health capacity was poor, our capacity to expand and do more things in the public health space was also not great. And as a result, that first six months was pretty bad,” he said. He described how communicating with politicians was “obviously a challenge” – as it was in other countries – because they came to the pandemic with no insight or knowledge of the science. “Getting them to understand that was something which I think was a struggle,” he said. Bell was particularly critical of the heightened nationalism that hampered efforts to quell the pandemic around the world. Over the course of the crisis, some countries promoted their own approaches to tackling the pandemic, released misleading statements on certain vaccines, and secured doses and therapies at the expense of other countries. “There were some really bad things that were not just lamentable but disgraceful in many ways,” he said. “There was a real switch to nationalism during this pandemic. Everybody looked after their own. They protected their own interests in a really profound way. But worse than that, it was to the disadvantage of people who couldn’t look after themselves. “What emerged from that was the failure to provide rapid access to innovations to developing countries which I think will be the longstanding message from this pandemic: that we didn’t do what we all said we were going to do, which was to get developing countries up to speed,” he added. Worst of all, Bell said, is that it is not clear the world has learned the major lessons to be prepared for the next pandemic. “You know, we’ve had big efforts at the G7 and the G20 … all that stuff,” he said. “I don’t see any tangible steps to make this any better than the next time than it was the last time. And I think that is one of the ugly realities of where we are today.”",News/World news,"Profiteering over Covid PPE ‘disgraceful’, says UK government adviser",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/30/profiteering-over-covid-ppe-disgraceful-says-uk-government-adviser
3/30/2022,"Here’s a fun fact: the guy on the front of a Pringles can has a name – Julius Pringles. Here’s an even funner fact: Pringles only started using that name in 2013, after Kellogg’s acquired the company and trademarked it – before using it in a half-hearted social media push involving Jimmy Fallon and then sort of forgetting about it for a bit. Here’s the funnest fact of all: the first fun fact began as a lie, until one day it became the truth. Julius Pringles began his existence not in a marketing brainstorming session at Kellogg’s HQ in 2013, but in a college dorm room in 2006, when two freshmen quietly inserted the name into the Pringles Wikipedia page as an element of lighthearted vandalism: The Pringles logo is a stylized cartoon caricature of the head of a male figure (commonly known as “Julius Pringles”) designed by Louis R Dixon. Unlike most Wikipedia vandalism, it had a bit more effort behind it than simply whacking the edit button and dropping in a lie. One of the pair, Justin Shillock, was already a Wikipedia moderator with a fairly solid reputation, and the two immediately made a Facebook group – “Who knew he was named Julius Pringles?” – to help embed the claim further. After it was removed once, it was re-added, in a different format further up the page. After a while, the name ended up just sticking around on the Wikipedia page, never quite getting enough attention to garner a “citation needed” tag, and eventually becoming such a longstanding claim on the page, only a total redraft by a dedicated editor would have had a chance of dislodging it. Fake news travels fast Such falsehoods haven’t been uncommon, particularly in the early days of Wikipedia. As much as the site has now outgrown its reputation among educators and experts as an untrustworthy den of calumny, it’s worth acknowledging that its reputation didn’t come from nowhere. And while Wikipedia’s systems, both formal and informal, do generally work to expel low-effort vandalism, falsehoods can stick around if they start to interact with the world outside the site. Almost a decade ago, the webcomic XKCD coined the phrase “citogenesis” to describe the process whereby a fake fact on Wikipedia is copied by a rushed journalist into an article, which is itself used as a source to “prove” the truth of the fact. For instance: a friend, whose anonymity I’ll preserve, once decided to add a fictional biographical detail to the page for Belarusian writer Svetlana Alexivitch – that she “briefly worked on Belarus’ first carp-fishing magazine”. The claim was live for barely 15 minutes before an eagle-eyed editor pulled it, but that was still long enough for the claim to make it into a Deutsche Welle profile of the author. But this is the first example I’ve heard of something that goes beyond mere citogenesis. Here, a piece of Wikipedia vandalism managed to weave a true fact into reality, where it lay dormant until a viral tweet earlier this week. It shows, I think, the inadequacy of so much conventional discussion around misinformation on the internet. Sometimes there really is such a thing as “fake news”: the claim that the pope endorsed Donald Trump for president really is, simply, false. But the internet isn’t distinct from the wider world, and sometimes it can do more than simply reflect reality. It can alter it, too. That’s not to say that enough people believing in the Ghost of Kyiv will suddenly summon a fighter ace into the sky above Ukraine. But if enough people believe plucky tractor drivers are taking on Russian tanks and winning – well, that might be the sort of fact that begins as propaganda and blossoms into something else.

3/30/2022,"The illustrator Masha Foya’s horror at witnessing a full-scale war unfold in her own country over a matter of weeks is captured uncompromisingly in her artwork for the cover of this week’s Guardian Weekly magazine. “Every time I hear about new crimes against my people, a part of me disappears,” Foya writes from western Ukraine, where she has been living since evacuating from Kyiv. “Every time I think it is impossible for the Russian occupiers to do more shameful acts – but then the morning comes and I learn about even more disgusting things. “What they did with Mariupol … I just have no words, it’s just the extermination of civilians, this is unforgivable. And this nightmare is happening in the 21st century. But I still do not give up and all of us believe in our victory, believe in the strength of our country!” In many ways the plight of Mariupol encapsulates the subconscious horror of Russia’s assault on Ukraine. With the besieged port city having long been deemed unsafe by news crews, few clear details now emanate – but what has done so hints at the nightmarish plight of many thousands of people trapped in a ruined city without food, clean water or power. Using diary material from residents, Daniel Boffey pieces together the story of how a city descended from normality to nightmare in a matter of days.

3/30/2022,"Ikea is planning to close one of its six London stores with the potential loss of 450 jobs as the furniture retailer shifts towards online and high street locations. The Swedish retailer is to close the store in Tottenham, north London, later this year, just a decade after its opening caused a riot with a 1,000 cars reported to have queued up on opening day and six shoppers taken to hospital amid the chaos. News of the planned closure comes just weeks after Ikea opened a new kind of high street outlet in Hammersmith, west London, in February and ahead of the opening of a warehouse in Dartford, Kent, that will enable home deliveries within 24 hours across the capital. It is also preparing to open a store in Topshop’s former flagship on Oxford Circus in central London in autumn 2023 as part of £1bn investment in the capital over the next three years. Ikea said it was adapting to “changing shopping behaviours” with over half its sales now made online. The retailer has previously closed only one large store in the UK – in Coventry in 2020. It has also tested, and closed, smaller high street outlets, including on Tottenham Court Road in central London. The latest closure is another sign of difficulties for shops on high streets, retail parks and shopping centres, which led to nearly 8,000 more outlets left empty last year, according to the analysts Local Data Company. The pandemic has accelerated the switch to home shopping amid worries about the transmission of Covid and a series of government-enforced lockdowns on physical stores to control the spread of the virus. Ikea said the switch to online shopping and the redevelopment of the area where the Tottenham store is located had prompted it “to assess the long-term viability of the site”. The company said it was entering collective consultation with the 450 workers affected by its plan to close the store and aimed to retain as many people as possible, with 600 vacancies elsewhere in London. Peter Jelkeby, the retail manager for Ikea’s UK and Irish business, said: “Taking care of our co-workers is our highest priority and we will lead with respect and compassion throughout the process. The decision to propose closing the Tottenham store has not been taken lightly but we believe it is the right thing to do for our customers and business as we strengthen our position for the future.”",News/Business,"Ikea plans to close Tottenham branch, putting 450 jobs at risk",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/30/ikea-plans-to-close-london-tottenham-branch-putting-450-jobs-at-risk
3/30/2022,"We’ve come a long way from June 2017 when, one month before the start of the European Championship in the Netherlands, I was first asked to write a weekly women’s football blog for the Guardian. In many ways the growth of our coverage has gone hand-in-hand with the growth of the game. That is to be expected. The relationship between the media and football is not mutually exclusive: as women’s football grows, the demand for coverage grows and, as coverage increases, the game grows. So, in the months leading up to the next Euros and in a week in which up to 85,000 fans are expected to flood into the Camp Nou to watch the European champions Barcelona play at the ground for the first time, against Real Madrid in the Champions League and potentially setting a record attendance for a club game, it feels apt that we are launching a weekly women’s football newsletter – the first by a UK national newspaper. The weekly blog once played the role that this newsletter will, it rounded up the week in talking points at the bottom of a longer feature. However, as the game pushed against its various constraints, so too the volume of news and stories pushed against the constraints of the column’s five bullet points and its word count. Since then our coverage has expanded significantly and is a core part of Guardian Sport’s football coverage. In conjunction with the Offside Rule, we are into our fifth year of the top 100 female football players list, we launched a women’s football transfer interactive in 2020 that tracks the comings and goings of the top five European summer leagues, we have minute-by-minute coverage of at least one game in every round of the domestic campaign, I was taken on to write full-time on the women’s game and, in 2020, we launched a WSL player in focus series – to name just a few ways we have expanded our coverage. This newsletter – delivered every Wednesday – is part of our continuing commitment to expanding our coverage of women’s football. There will be much more innovation to come to help advance our quest for the comprehensive coverage that the game deserves and, critically, people want. Sign up here Most exciting for me is that this newsletter will be primarily written and put together by two longstanding women’s football writers and content creators, Girls on the Ball’s Sophie Downey and Brazilian women’s football writer Júlia Belas Trindade, whose knowledge of the game both in England and internationally is extensive. “I have been working in women’s football for almost 10 years now and the goal for me has always been about growing the game and getting as many eyes on it as possible,” Sophie says. “Being involved in the Guardian’s newsletter allows me to do this. It will help me continue my passion of shining a light on the beautiful game and the amazing stories and people behind the scenes. I’m excited to bring our readers news from around the world not only on the pitch but off it too. There is so much to uncover.” Júlia adds: “I am so happy to be a part of this team. I have been covering women’s football in Brazil for years, but now, as I am based in the UK, I really wanted to become more international – and this is what I’ll bring to our readers. I want to show everyone that football is not only about the attendances, titles or goals, but also about the lives it touches everywhere, from the UK to Brazil, Europe, America, Asia and Oceania. Writing about football is what drives me forward, and hopefully, I’ll be able to pass that along.” In addition to Júlia and Sophie, the newsletter will host the views of some of the biggest and most thoughtful names in the game, such as Ada Hegerberg, Anita Asante and Hope Solo. In guest columns they, and others to come, will be able to highlight the issues that matter most to them. We hope this newsletter becomes an essential and engaging point of contact for anyone wanting to keep abreast of what is going on in women’s football but also provides humour, debate and fun alongside the week-by-week news of the game.

3/30/2022,"The UK has granted only 2,700 visas under its much advertised Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme more than two weeks after its launch, according to Home Office figures released on Wednesday. The department also released updated figures about the number of people who have been granted visas to come to stay with British relatives. The Ukraine Family scheme, which has been running since the start of March, has issued 22,800 visas. More than 3.9 million refugees have left Ukraine, with the vast majority of them settling in Poland, according to the UNHCR. An estimated 6.5 million people have been displaced within Ukraine. Dozens of people who hoped to bring refugees to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme have contacted the Guardian to express frustration at the slowness of the visa granting system. More than 150,000 people signed up to express interest in hosting refugees. Applicants have complained that there is no way to track applications, leaving refugees uncertain about whether to begin travelling to the UK, or to remain in Ukraine. Some people have complained that the online form is badly designed, contains glitches and is difficult to complete if English is not your first language. Others have struggled with the amount of documentation needed, questioning whether it is realistic for people fleeing war zones to have brought bank statements, or other documentary evidence proving they were resident in Ukraine. Some people have reported that some family members have been granted visas while others have not, leaving them with difficult decisions about whether to split families as they try to seek safety. Numerous potential hosts have contacted the Guardian describing their fears for the safety of refugees they are hoping to host, who are waiting, often in unsuitable accommodation, for visas to be granted. Leading refugee charities this week called on the government to waive visas for Ukrainian refugees, as a short-term measure, to bring the UK in line with measures taken by the EU. The Refugee Council, the British Red Cross, Save the Children and Oxfam said the visa system was “causing great distress to already traumatised Ukrainians”. “Those who want to come to the UK are having to navigate a complex web of bureaucratic paperwork to get visas, leaving them facing protracted delays without any information about the status of their application,” the charity heads wrote. Lord Harrington, the refugees minister, said changes had been made to the application scheme to try to streamline it, but agreed further improvements were needed. “We are starting to see progress because of changes the Home Office made to streamline the visa process and put additional resources into the system. However, we need to do more and will be making further improvements to bring people to the UK as quickly as possible,” he said. “I look forward to welcoming more families and ensuring they have the support they need when they arrive.”",News/UK news,"Only 2,700 visas granted under UK’s Homes for Ukraine scheme ",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/30/only-2700-visas-granted-under-uks-homes-for-ukraine-scheme
