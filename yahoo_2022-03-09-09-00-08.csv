3/9/2022,"An oilfield company in West Texas is facing charges after a husband and wife died from a gas leak inside a company-owned facility, as their children waited for them in a car outside, according to the Department of Justice. The charges, announced Tuesday, March 8, stem from the fatal incident on Oct. 26, 2019, authorities said in a news release. That night, Jacob Dean — an employee of Odessa-based Aghorn Operating Inc. — received a call to check on a pump house located on an oilfield in Odessa, according to federal officials. He didn’t return home when expected and wasn’t answering calls from his wife, Natalee Dean. Growing worried, she drove out to the pump house to check on her husband, bringing their children, ages 6 and 9, along for the ride. While the kids waited in the car, she went in to find her husband and never came back out. “A pump had failed in the pump house, causing a leak of produced water containing hydrogen sulfide,” the release said. Produced water is a byproduct of oil and gas production and can contain harmful chemicals. “Jacob had been overcome by hydrogen sulfide in the pump house, and when Natalee arrived at the station, she exited the vehicle and proceeded to the pump house, where she too was overcome by the gas,” the release said, adding that both were pronounced dead at the scene by first responders. “Aghorn was aware that its produced water contained high amounts of H2S as well as the deadly nature of the gas,” an indictment read, alleging that Aghorn and its vice president “knowingly violated their general duty to prevent the accidental release [of the gas],” and knowingly put lives at risk. McClatchy News reached out to Aghorn Operating Inc. by phone and the company declined to comment. Hydrogen sulfide gas is colorless but has a “strong odor of rotten eggs,” according to the CDC. Depending on the concentration, people who are exposed to the gas could collapse within minutes or experience “knockdown,” or immediate collapse, within 1 to 2 breaths, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Aghorn Operating Inc. and company Vice President Trent Day are accused of “obstructing” an investigation into the couple’s deaths and of violating the Clean Air Act, according to federal officials. Aghorn, Day, and another company called Kodiak Roustabout Inc., are also charged with breaking the Safe Drinking Water Act and “making false statements” to state officials “regarding the mechanical integrity of Aghorn injection wells.” Husband arrested after wife and her parents shot to death at Arkansas home, cops say Teen doing donuts in forklift dies when machinery falls on him, Tennessee police say Sonic worker’s car explodes outside restaurant.

3/9/2022,"OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — A high-profile Oklahoma attorney is asking the state Supreme Court to stop the special election for Oklahoma’s open U.S. Senate seat, arguing the U.S. Constitution does not allow a special election to fill the post until it's vacant. Enid attorney Stephen Jones, who gained national prominence as the attorney for convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, filed the lawsuit late Monday. Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe, 87, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced last month that he plans to resign in January, just two years into his six-year term. He submitted an “irrevocable pledge"" to the Oklahoma Secretary of State's Office on Feb. 28, triggering a new state law that allows the governor to set special election dates that coincide with Oklahoma's regularly scheduled primary, runoff and general election dates. Gov. Kevin Stitt set the special election dates on March 1. But Jones argues in his lawsuit that the governor lacked the authority to do so because Inhofe hasn't vacated the office yet. He wants the state Supreme Court to direct the Oklahoma Election Board not to accept declarations of candidacy for the office or print ballots for the contest. The lawsuit contends the 17th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits such an election until there is a vacancy and that the governor should appoint a replacement for Inhofe after he officially vacates the office next year. Oklahoma Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax, who is the defendant in the lawsuit, declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. Ziriax will be represented by the Office of the Attorney General. A spokeswoman for Oklahoma Attorney General John O'Connor said the office will respond in a brief once the court sets a briefing schedule. Inhofe's announcement has already triggered a series of political dominoes as politicians eyed a potential move to higher office. U.S. Rep. Markwayne Mullin already announced he's leaving his 2nd Congressional District seat to run. Other Republican candidates include state Sen. Nathan Dahm and Inhofe's former chief of staff, Luke Holland. Among potential Democratic candidates are former U.S. Rep. Kendra Horn, who won the 5th Congressional District seat in one of the biggest upsets of the 2018 midterm elections, before Republicans captured the seat back in 2020. Mullin's decision also led to a flurry of announcements by Republicans for his seat that covers most of eastern Oklahoma, including Oklahoma Republican Party Chairman and former state Rep. John Bennett; state Sen. Marty Quinn, of Claremore; Muskogee pharmacist Chris Schiller; and Army veteran Erick Wyatt.",Politics/Associated Press,Attorney seeks to stop special election for Inhofe's seat,https://news.yahoo.com/attorney-seeks-stop-special-election-203807821.html

3/9/2022,"In his new book, William Barr described how Trump would treat guests at meetings. Barr, the former attorney general, wrote that Trump would ensure everyone always had a Diet Coke. Trump would deal out Hershey bars ""as if dealing cards,"" Barr wrote. Former Attorney General William Barr has a passage in his new book about the lengths his old boss would go to in order to charm guests at meetings. ""Always the attentive host, he would constantly ensure that everyone had a Diet Coke to drink,"" Barr wrote. ""If he was feeling especially beneficent, he would open a cigar box and deal out his stash of big Hershey chocolate bars as if dealing cards. I always accepted; you have to play the hand you're dealt."" While parts of Barr's book, titled ""One Damn Thing After Another: Memoirs of an Attorney General,"" focus on disagreements he had with President Donald Trump, Barr took a more sympathetic view of how Trump handled meetings. ""Despite allowing the frequent re-litigation of issues, the relaxed, ad hoc meetings in the President's little dining room, though always discursive, could be very productive,"" Barr wrote. ""President Trump would sit at the head of the table, the TV playing in the background and a huge stack of documents to his left, which he worked his way through methodically—using his big, bold Sharpie to sign photos or annotate news clippings to send to cabinet secretaries."" Trump was known to watch hours of TV — mostly cable news — in a single morning before heading down to the Oval Office. Barr acknowledged that Trump's having the TV on in the background did lead to some interruptions, but overall he recalled the meetings fondly. ""The conversation would meander along, winding through numerous diversions—some prompted by a TV item, some by new arrivals, some by the mysterious workings of the President's stream of consciousness,"" Barr wrote. ""But we would eventually reach a decision, and it was often fun getting there.""

3/9/2022,"By Patricia Zengerle, Humeyra Pamuk and Mike Stone WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Poland's decision to put all its MiG-29 fighter jets at the disposal of the United States was ""a surprise move"" by Warsaw, the U.S. State Department's No. 3 diplomat said on Tuesday, after Ukraine asked European countries to provide aircraft to help it fight Russia's invasion. ""To my knowledge, it wasn't pre-consulted with us that they planned to give these planes to us,"" State Department Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. ""So I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles,"" she said. Poland is ready to deploy all its MiG-29 jets to Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the United States, and urges other NATO members that own planes of that type to do the same, the Polish Foreign Ministry said earlier. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last week made a ""desperate plea for European countries to provide Russian-made planes"" for Ukraine's fight against Russian invaders during a video call Saturday with U.S. lawmakers. U.S. lawmakers have been pushing the Biden administration to facilitate the transfer of fighter aircraft to Ukraine from Poland and other NATO and Eastern European countries. The administration has been discussing Ukraine's request with Poland. U.S. administration officials said there were logistical challenges both in moving aircraft into Ukraine and providing replacement American planes. The decision by Warsaw to offer its fleet of Soviet-era MIG-29 fighter jets to the United States set experts in the U.S. government scrambling for information on the legal constraints around the retransfer of the jets to Ukraine. Nuland said the main issue was to assess what Poland's immediate needs would be given it is adjacent to the conflict. ""Poland -- they benefit from full air security from the NATO alliance. ... The main issue is to evaluate what Poland's immediate needs are in the context of being a neighbor of this conflict,"" she said, adding that Washington was also looking at putting some Patriot missile batteries into Poland. Poland is supporting Kyiv with defensive weapons, but has said it would not send jets to Ukraine, as it is not a direct party to the conflict between Ukraine - which is not a NATO ally - and Russia. CUTTING THROUGH RED TAPE? The U.S. Air Force and Department of Defense officials were still trying to understand the repercussions of the Polish MiG transfer but said the White House's National Security Council was in the best position to understand whether the United States could even accept the jets as a donation. If that donation were possible, it was unclear whether the U.S. could then transfer the jets to Ukraine, or whether the jets needed to be accepted, declared as excess, and then go through a process of transfer for excess defense articles. Landing slots for the Polish jets at a U.S. air base in Germany and other practical concerns on how to physically get the jets into Ukraine were other unanswered legal questions, experts said. The National Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The United States maintains a reserve of excess weapons, which can be transferred to other nations as long as certain statutory and regulatory hurdles are cleared. If the MIGs are able to be classified as excess defense articles, the president is required to give Congress 30 days' notice of a transfer, said Franklin Turner, a government contracts lawyer at McCarter & English. He added that there was ""a tremendous amount of red tape that clogs this process"" and that Biden's ability to cut through it was constrained by existing legal requirements.
