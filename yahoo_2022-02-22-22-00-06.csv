2/22/2022,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Senator Elizabeth Warren have clashed over taxes yet again. Musk tweeted that he'd visit the IRS office ""just to say hi"" and maybe get a cookie. ""I paid the most taxes ever in history for an individual last year,"" the tech billionaire added. Tesla CEO Elon Musk isn't standing down over his feud with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Musk and the Democratic senator keep clashing over whether or not the tech billionaire pays taxes – and now he's suggested that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) might give him a cookie, claiming that he ""paid the most taxes ever in history for an individual"" in 2021. He tweeted his suggestion in response to comments made by Warren in an interview with CNN's ""New Day"" on Sunday. ""Elon Musk in 2018, we've actually seen his tax returns,"" Warren said. ""You know how much he paid in taxes, one of the richest people in the world? Zero."" Musk replied to a clip of the interview on Twitter Sunday, saying that next time he was in Washington D.C. he'd visit the IRS office. ""Will visit IRS next time I'm in DC just to say hi, since I paid the most taxes ever in history for an individual last year,"" he said. ""Maybe I can have a cookie or something …"" Elon Musk is currently the world's richest person, according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, with a net worth of $220 billion. He sits ahead of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, whose wealth Bloomberg puts at $177 billion. Musk and Warren have been clashing for months over his taxes – largely on Twitter. In December, the senator had accused him of ""freeloading"" over taxes after he was named Time's Person of the Year, and Musk snapped back by calling Warren ""Senator Karen."" ProPublica reported that Musk paid no federal income taxes in 2018, and that between 2014 and 2018 he reported $1.52 billion worth of taxable income to the IRS and paid $455 million in taxes, despite his wealth growing by $13.9 billion. But Musk has insisted that he pays taxes. He told The Babylon Bee that in 2021 he was ""literally paying the most tax that any individual in history has ever paid."" He added that his taxes are ""super simple"" and that he has no offshore accounts or ""elaborate tax-avoidance schemes."" Insider previously reported that the Internal Revenue Service does not publicly disclose the tax information of individuals, making it difficult to know whether Musk is paying the largest tax bill in history, as he claims.

2/22/2022,"MOSCOW, Feb 21 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin railed against Ukraine in a televised address on Monday, saying that neo-Nazis were on the rise, oligarchic clans were rife and that the ex-Soviet country was a U.S. colony with a puppet regime. Russia's rouble, already under pressure from a vast Russian military buildup near Ukraine, tumbled to new weeks-long lows as he spoke from behind a wooden office desk flanked by Russian tricolour flags. He described eastern Ukraine as ancient Russian lands and modern Ukraine as a state created by the Bolsheviks after the 1917 revolution. He said that Ukraine never had a tradition of genuine statehood and complained that post-Soviet Ukraine had wanted everything it could from Moscow without doing anything in return. Ahead of the speech, Putin said that Russia would decide on Monday whether or not to recognise the independence of two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.

2/22/2022,"By Tom Sims FRANKFURT (Reuters) - While Ukraine's airspace has been largely empty amid the crisis with Russia, a remotely piloted U.S. military vehicle called the RQ-4 Global Hawk has flown over the country in circles for hours at a time. Over the past month, two of the spy planes have travelled on regular missions from the Mediterranean Sea to Ukraine, where they have navigated in repeated loops in the north and the east, according to Flightradar24. The drones' high-altitude, long-distance flights have coincided with a military build-up by Russia along the Ukrainian border and a flurry of diplomacy among leaders of the United States, Europe and Russia to avert war. At times, the two planes - under the call signs Forte10, Forte11 and Forte12 - have been the only active aircraft publicly visible over eastern Ukraine. Aviation watchers have taken note, speculating that the United States is making its presence known in a show of force. ""With these types of flights, leaving the transponder on is a conscious decision,"" said Ian Petchenik, communications director at Flightradar24. The U.S. Air Force declined to comment on the details of the flights but said the United States routinely operates aircraft in support of intelligence objectives. ""These missions demonstrate our continued commitment to safety and security in the region,"" a spokesperson said. On Monday evening, Forte11 returned to the Mediterranean after a nearly 24-hour trip over Ukraine. Its transponder went off at a low altitude near the Sigonella Naval Air Station in Sicily. It was the 13th similar mission. According to the Air Force's website, the mission of such aircraft is to collect intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance ""to support joint combatant forces in worldwide peacetime, contingency and wartime operations."" Their manufacturer, Northrop Grumman, says the planes see ""potential threats"" and ""gather near-real-time, high-resolution imagery of large areas of land in all types of weather – day or night."" The flight path has stood out because international commercial aviation, out of an abundance of caution, has largely avoided Ukraine airspace, especially in the east along the Russian border. On Feb. 15, Flightradar24 said Forte11 was its most tracked flight, and then later reported that it had been airborne for more than 21 hours. The aircraft, with a wingspan of nearly 40 meters and length of 15 meters, can typically fly more than 30 hours. In 2014, the craft travelled 34.3 hours without refuelling to set a record for the U.S. Air Force, according to its website. Northrop Grumman has been providing the aircraft to the USAF for 20 years. In August, it won a five-year contract to maintain the craft for NATO.

2/22/2022,"Donald Trump released his social media app Truth Social to iPhone users on Monday. The logo closely resembles that of Trailar, UK company that fixes solar panels on trucks. A Trailar executive said the company is ""seeking legal advice."" The logo for Donald Trump's new social media app Truth Social features a broken ""T"" on a blue background. It's strikingly similar to the logo used by Trailar, a British trucking firm. So similar, in fact, that an executive from Trailar says his company is considering legal action against Truth Social. Truth Social launched on Apple's App Store late Sunday but the launch was hit by technical difficulties. On Monday morning, an Insider reporter tried using Truth Social. It took them five attempts to sign up before they were wait-listed. As of 5.30 a.m. ET on Tuesday, they were still on the wait-list. Trailar fits solar panels to trucks and other large vehicles, and provides data analytics to the trucking industry. A Twitter user compared the Trailar and Truth Social logos side by side: Matthew Summers, head of marketing at Trailer, confirmed to Insider on Tuesday that the company was considering legal action against Truth Social because of the similarity of the two logos. Summers had earlier told The Daily Beast: ""We are now seeking legal advice to understand next steps and options available to protect our brand."" On Monday, Trailar tweeted members of Trump's family, including his son Donald Jr., his daughter Ivanka, and wife Melania. Trump himself was permanently suspended from Twitter in January 2021. Trailar's tweet said: ""Great to see Donald Trump supporting a growing sustainability business! Maybe ask next time?"" The company behind Truth Social, Trump Media and Technology Group, did not immediately respond when contacted by Insider for comment outside of regular US working hours. Trailar's tweek also said: ""@AldiUK Don't happen to have the number for your legal team on you?"" It's not entirely clear why Trailar referenced the German supermarket chain. However, last year, Aldi was caught up in a copyright battle with UK supermarket Marks & Spencer over apparent similarities between their two caterpillar cakes. Marks & Spencer claimed that Aldi's ""Cuthbert the Caterpillar"" cake infringed the copyright of its own ""Colin the Caterpillar"" cake. The two companies reached a settlement earlier this month. Trump was kicked off mainstream social media platforms Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube in January 2021 after the January 6 storming of the US Capitol. Twitter permanently suspended Trump's account, citing a ""risk of further incitement to violence,"" after he released a video in which he told rioters: ""Go home. We love you; you're very special.""

2/22/2022,"By Tuvan Gumrukcu and Ece Toksabay ANKARA (Reuters) - When Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his decision to recognise two breakaway regions in east Ukraine as independent, NATO member and Black Sea neighbour Turkey swiftly criticised the move, but stopped short of announcing any punitive measures. Turkey is in a unique bind: it has good ties with both Ukraine and Russia, but also opposes sanctions in principle, just as the West is poised to slap them on Moscow as long promised. The crisis leaves President Tayyip Erdogan balancing those diplomatic relations along with his duties within NATO, while also protecting Turkey's beleaguered economy from back-to-back shocks after a currency crisis in December. Any step too far against Moscow, and Ankara risks upsetting important Russian energy supplies, trade and tourism, analysts say. ""It is the prospect of a prolonged bloodless conflict or substantive sanctions on Russia's energy exports that could hurt Turkey deeply (and threaten) economic stability,"" said Atilla Yesilada, Istanbul-based analyst at GlobalSource Partners. Striking the balance Turkey employed for decades, Erdogan often highlights his friendship with Putin but has warned Russia against an invasion and offered to mediate the crisis. He has also criticised the West's handling of things as a hindrance to peace. On Tuesday, Turkey called Russia's recognition of Ukraine's separatists an unacceptable violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity. Ergodan - who visited Kyiv this month - rejected it and called on parties to respect international laws, likely his sharpest language towards Moscow since a crisis over Turkey's downing of a Russian jet near Turkey's Syrian border in 2015. Erdogan and Putin have since warmed and Turkey bought Russian missile defences in 2019, which prompted U.S. anger and sanctions. Since then, Ankara has opposed sanctions against any country. ""Sanctions against Russia are useless. You only postpone the problems,"" Turkish Presidential Spokesman Ibrahim Kalin told Die Welt at the weekend, adding ""new rules and principles"" were needed for both Russia and the West to ""feel safe"". ""Russia feels threatened by NATO,"" he added. While cooperating with Russia in energy and trade, Turkey has also sold sophisticated drones to Ukraine and inked a deal to co-produce more, angering Moscow. Complicating diplomacy, Turkey opposes Russian policies in Syria and Libya even as it forges cooperation on the ground there. It also opposes Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, and its recognition of the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions in Georgia as independent. VULNERABLE LIRA Russia supplied some 46% of Turkey's gas last year, and Ankara is looking to strike shorter-duration gas deals with Moscow to relieve import costs. Inflation has soared to near 50%, hurting Erdogan's poll standing, after the lira crash. The currency slipped to its lowest since mid-January on concerns over economic fallout including for Turkey's tourism sector, for which Russians are the top arrivals. Without elaborating, Erdogan has said Turkey will do what is necessary as a NATO member in the event of a Russian invasion. The 1936 Montreux Convention gives Turkey control over the straits within its borders, and during peacetime guarantees access for civilian vessels to and from the Black Sea. It also limits access of naval warships, helping to protect the Black Sea from militarisation. Can Kasapoglu, director of security and defence studies programme at EDAM, said Turkey had made clear it backs Ukraine. But a Russian troop buildup in the Black Sea should ""really worry"" it, especially the risk of a change of leadership in Ukraine, he said. ""In this case, defence technology cooperation with Turkey may be suspended, as Russia is uncomfortable with a NATO nation's defence technological and industrial base developing ties with the post-Soviet space,"" he said.
