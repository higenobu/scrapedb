1/27/2022,"He sits there silently on the frontbench, the man with nothing to say about the great swirl of chaos all around him. What is Rishi Sunak thinking? “There is a tide in the affairs of men. Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.” Miss it, warns Brutus the conspirator, and all his life will be “bound in shallows and in miseries”. Indeed, this chancellor may never get another chance to shoot through to No 10. But when exactly is that damned tide at the flood? When Gray’s anatomy of No 10 parties is published, perhaps. Or when those notoriously dilatory plods report? Boris Johnson hopes that delaying the partygate reckoning will allow him to fortify his dam against that flood. His backers try to frighten Tory MPs by threatening that a new leader means a general election.  Sunak sees Ladbrokes’ latest betting odds showing his chances of succession at 11/8, while the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, trails at 6/1. The old Tory superstition says the hand that wields the dagger never wears the crown, but this is a time of broken Tory traditions. Sunak rides high as a small-state, low-tax, fiscal austerian – always a true Brexiter. But when to strike? Former political adviser Dominic Cummings has been his promoter, engineering the resignation of Sajid Javid from the Treasury to make way for Sunak as his protege. But that’s not a great calling card right now. Doubts about him in his party focus on his slender political experience – such a thin record fails to reveal if he has the stuff of leadership in him. His meteoric rise has left little trail behind him. All that we know is that he has glided effortlessly upwards, from Winchester to PPE at Oxford to a Fulbright scholarship at Stanford; then onwards to Goldman Sachs and hedge fund management, making his fortune. He danced into one of the very safest Tory seats, with a majority of 23,000. Along the way he married into a billionaire family. Last year he was challenged on a possible failure to declare his wife’s shareholding in Infosys, which has held contracts with government ministries and public bodies; the sums involved were so vast that she was revealed to be richer than the Queen. Burnishing his memories of a summer vacation once working as a waiter in the restaurant of a family friend looks as absurd as most attempts to deny privilege. Why should a high-flying Tory need to? The doubts are about his untested character, his fortitude, daring, imagination, political nous and agility; whether he can balance an instinctive feel for his party’s and the public’s mood while still steering the ship of state in a purposeful political direction – the ingredients of good leadership. Some or almost all of those have been missing from recent Tory leaders, and he would be their fourth in just six years. Tory MPs and members have not been good choosers. He sits there, as invisible as possible, waiting for the premiership to drop, ripe and ready, into his lap – like everything else in his life. But waiting for his party to bring it to him on a silver platter is not the look of a leader, especially while so many of his colleagues are humiliating themselves defending Johnson’s indefensible behaviour and preposterous lies. Sunak neither defends nor attacks, but to use Johnson’s metaphor, waits at the back of the scrum for the ball to come loose. One of the valiant is Truss, out there proclaiming, mendaciously, her “hundred per cent support of the prime minister”, dutifully listing his Brexit and vaccine rollout triumphs. Hers is the better part of valour, not his silent discretion. Anyone who stays in the cabinet, or indeed any Tory MP waiting without declaring, is complicit in everything that has been revealed so far about the nature of Johnson and his regime. As long as ministers draw their salaries they should back their leader, at least in public. (Truss’s “fizz with Liz” private wooing of MPs for when that ball finally emerges is another matter.) If Sunak resigned, Johnson would be done for, as Theresa May was when Johnson resigned as foreign secretary. If the chancellor wants to prove his leadership qualities, he should refuse to be party to all this dishonesty, be brave, and make his pitch as a clean pair of hands. Otherwise that silver platter may pass to someone willing to fight for it. If Johnson clings on, possibly surviving a confidence vote, he will bow to blackmail from the rightwing MPs now filing in to see him, demanding he “be a real Conservative”. He already flails around for totemic rightist acts as they urge more culture wars, more curbing unemployment benefits, assaulting the BBC, pushing back migrant boats, getting rid of “green crap” policies for net zero targets, cutting spending and not raising national insurance – even as the NHS and schools flounder. These true believers ignore Johnson’s clever “levelling up” electoral trick, which attracted voters with false promises of a spending bonanza. If Sunak vacillates now, the brutal results of all the above will soon bequeath him an angry electorate drowning in bills, with inflation rising above their falling pay. The halcyon days of “eat out to help out” will be long obliterated by his austerity years. If he does seize the crown, calling a general election now might be his best chance.

1/27/2022,"Sevilla have ended negotiations with Newcastle over Diego Carlos and do not expect the central defender to depart during the transfer window. Final conversations between the clubs were held three days ago, with Newcastle’s offer rejected because it was insufficient and Sevilla would not have been able to adequately replace him at short notice. Sevilla’s sporting director, Monchi, admitted that had the offer arrived in the summer it might have been different but he considers this market closed. The only way Newcastle could sign Diego Carlos would be to pay his €70m (£58.4m) buyout clause. Monchi said the defender was happy at Sevilla and the captain, Ivan Rakitic, insisted “sometimes it is a big opportunity but Diego and other players know what they have here”.  “The offer was very important, respectful, but it was an offer that our board considered insufficient,” Monchi said during a conference call set up by La Liga. “It is also true that it was maybe not the best time. It’s a difficult market in which to find a replacement for him. If the offer had come in the summer, things may have been different. Jules [Koundé] is a magnificent player and I would say the same about Diego Carlos. I think he is one of the top five central defenders in Europe. “I was talking to Diego Carlos this morning and he was happy,” Monchi added, joking: “Given how strong he is, if he wasn’t I might have had to change my mind. “I want to go on holiday as soon as this call is over so if there are no signings while we’re talking, it’s finished. You never know – for as long as it is open, anything can happen – but our idea is that the market is over.” Rakitic acknowledged the Premier League was “a dream for a lot of players” but said: “Sevilla have grown, and that is seen in [Anthony] Martial joining us. This is a big club that can compete for everything and they know that too. For Diego and others this is a big opportunity to see Martial come here. Players don’t need to leave to be at a big club. Now they’re at a big club already. They know what they have here. I want players to be happy, have fun. A few jokes and Diego can be 100%, I am sure.”",Sport/Football,Sevilla say Newcastle offer for Diego Carlos ‘insufficient’ and talks are over,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/27/sevilla-newcastle-diego-carlos-offer-insufficient-talks-over
1/27/2022,"About £111m of taxpayers’ money has been wasted by the government over a decade on empty secure children’s home beds across England and Wales, Labour has said after an analysis of official statistics. Data released by the Ministry of Justice between 2010 and 2021 shows growing discrepancies between the number of secure children’s home beds procured, compared with the number of young people placed in them by the Youth Custody Service.  This is despite secure children’s homes being deemed as providing the “highest standards of care and rehabilitation” and despite the crisis of conditions in residential arrangements for young people, which inspectors have warned are deteriorating to “unacceptable” levels. Secure children’s homes are described by the government as a safe, locked environment for children who “could not be placed safely elsewhere”. In 2021, more than 48% of beds procured by the MoJ stood empty at a cost to the taxpayer of £14.1m, while HM Inspectorate of Prisons simultaneously reported an increase of violence and self-harm in young offender institutions (HMYOIs), with a 70% increase in violence at HMYOI Cookham Wood in Kent. An analysis by Labour has examined statistics showing the number of children accommodated in secure children’s homes over 10 years. Calculations of the amount of money spent on each empty bed were an estimation based on the number of empty beds each year versus the cost of each contracted individual place. Between 2010 and 2021, there were 515 empty secure children’s home beds for the 1,563 places allocated. Labour says the government must rethink its approach to secure centres for children. Anna McMorrin, the shadow minister for victims and youth justice, said: “Money poured down the drain by this government on empty secure home beds could have been better spent on driving down youth reoffending, improving custody conditions and keeping our communities safe. “Instead, we are seeing young offenders’ institutions descend into chaos and violence, reoffending rates higher than 10 years ago, and young people getting sucked into more criminal behaviour.” According to the latest published monthly statistics, there were 2,697 children and young people placed in the youth secure estate at the end of November 2009. At the end of November 2021, there were 515 children in secure children’s homes. Whitehall sources said the government was obliged to secure extra beds to ensure the welfare of children in its care. Responding to Labour’s analysis, a Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “There are 70% fewer children held in custody under this government, saving taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds.” “We need to ensure beds are available in secure children’s homes to meet the needs of the most vulnerable and complex children in custody. Additionally, we are investing £18.5m to help divert more vulnerable children from a life of crime – putting education, healthcare and rehabilitation at the heart of our efforts.”",News/Society,"Tories waste money on empty children’s home beds in England and Wales, says Labour",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/27/tories-waste-money-on-empty-childrens-home-beds-in-england-and-wales-says-labour
1/27/2022,"As a writer, comedian, radio quiz panellist, chatshow guest and occasional actor, Barry Cryer, who has died aged 86, was part of the backbone of British television and radio comedy for more than 60 years. He wrote for performers including Morecambe and Wise, the Two Ronnies, Tommy Cooper, Jack Benny, Bob Hope, George Burns, Frankie Howerd, Kenny Everett and Les Dawson, and was a member of the ramshackle but hilarious BBC radio show I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue from its inception in 1972. In the 1960s and 70s comedy writing was, with a few notable exceptions, dominated by men, often working in pairs, and Cryer’s partners included John Junkin, Marty Feldman, Graeme Garden, David Nobbs and Graham Chapman. Lacking a developed attention span (he called his 2009 autobiography Butterfly Brain), he left the basic idea, plot and structure to his partner, then funnied everything up, providing punchlines, gags and retorts. This is known as being a “line man” and Cryer was generally regarded as the best line man in the business.  In looks and offstage manner, Cryer was the kind of nondescript bloke you might find behind the counter at your local DIY centre. He told the story of how, when his face had become familiar through TV appearances, someone came up to him in the street and asked: “Can I have your autograph, Bal?” “Of course.” “Leave it out,” said the man. “You didn’t think I was serious?” Cryer got into a taxi and recounted the story. “Oh dear,” the driver chuckled. “Imagine that happening to someone well known!” This self-deprecation – almost all the stories Cryer told were against himself – began early in his performing career in the late 50s, when he was hospitalised several times for chronic eczema, and retreated from the spotlight into the more anonymous craft of scriptwriting. He was born in Leeds, to John Cryer, an accountant, who died when Barry was five, and his wife, Jean, and educated at Leeds grammar school. “I’ve been in touch with three of my schoolmates,” he said in 2019, “and it seems that when we were growing up I was the one who tried to make the bully laugh, and to entertain people, even though I never thought of doing it for a living then.” Cryer went on to study English literature at Leeds University, where an appearance in a revue led to his being offered a week’s work at Leeds City Varieties theatre. He began to think comedy might be a viable career choice, and after doing badly in his first year left university and moved to London, hoping a quick wit and inventiveness would compensate for an almost complete lack of experience. It did – he passed an audition for the Windmill theatre in Soho, which had comedy acts in between nude shows, and started his career as a bottom-of-the-bill comic. In 1957 he was in the hit stage show Expresso Bongo with Susan Hampshire, Millicent Martin and Paul Scofield. The same year he recorded the novelty song Purple People Eater, a big success for the American actor and singer Sheb Wooley. Contractual difficulties meant Wooley’s version could not be released in Scandinavia, and Cryer reached No 1 in the Finnish charts. Though his performing career was blossoming, his skin condition made further stage appearances problematical. “Eczema hospitalised me 12 times in eight years,” he told Reader’s Digest. “In those days we were caked in makeup as performers. I thought, ‘I’ve had it, I’ll concentrate on writing’.” He began writing, mostly for Danny La Rue at the drag star’s nightclub. “I was contentedly employed in the noble and honourable task of writing gags about men’s genitalia,” he said. “That is what I did: I was a cock-joke writer. I was not ashamed of it and I was happy doing it.” At La Rue’s he came to the attention of David Frost, who hired him to join a writing team that included Chapman, Feldman and John Cleese, for The Frost Report (BBC TV, 1966-67). Swiftly established as a valuable talent, Cryer wrote several BBC Morecambe and Wise shows with Junkin, including the 1972 and 1976 Christmas specials. He went back to performing, but on radio, in I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue and the sketch show Hello Cheeky (BBC, 1973-79), on which he and Junkin were joined by Tim Brooke-Taylor. There was a TV version in 1976. In 1962 he married the singer Theresa Donovan, known as Terry, and the couple moved to Hatch End, Middlesex, where they had four children. Cryer explained the secret of this happiest of partnerships: “The key is we’ve never understood each other. We don’t row, but we argue all the time.” Professionally, his most comfortable partnership was with Chapman, in pre-Python days. They wrote about 50 television shows together, including Doctor in the House (ITV, 1969-70), and several for Ronnie Corbett: No, That’s Me Over Here! (ITV, 1968-70), Now Look Here (BBC, 1971-73) and The Prince of Denmark (BBC, 1974). With other writers he contributed to The Ronnie Corbett Show (BBC, 1987) and Ronnie Corbett in Bed (BBC, 1971), and was also part of the Two Ronnies (1971-87) team. The other performer he became most associated with was the anarchic DJ turned comedian Kenny Everett. With Ray Cameron he wrote 35 episodes of The Kenny Everett Video Cassette (ITV, 1978-81) and, with Everett himself, 44 episodes of The Kenny Everett Television Show (BBC, 1981-88). In the 70s and 80s he wrote material for Russ Abbot, Stanley Baxter, Bruce Forsyth, Max Bygraves, Jasper Carrott, Tommy Cooper, the Carry On team, Dawson, Ken Dodd, Dick Emery, Bob Monkhouse, Howerd and Mike Yarwood, and for American stars visiting the UK. Cryer’s greatest professional triumph, this time as a performer, came when he joined Garden, Brooke-Taylor and Willie Rushton in the Radio 4 parody panel show I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue, chaired by Humphrey Lyttelton from 1972. The show survived Lyttelton’s death in 2008 and has more recently been chaired by Jack Dee. With Garden, Cryer also starred in a radio spin-off, You’ll Have Had Your Tea (2002-07), based around two Scots characters from the show, Hamish and Dougal. Another spin-off was a stage show with Rushton, Two Old Farts in the Night, which toured to great acclaim until Rushton’s death in 1996. Cryer was appointed OBE in 2001 and in 2017 received an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters at the University of Leeds. He is survived by Terry, their daughter, Jackie, and sons, Bob, Dave and Tony, seven grandchildren and a great-granddaughter.

1/27/2022,"A teenager has been arrested for a suspected hate crime after two Jewish men were attacked in north London while locking up their shop on the night before Holocaust Memorial Day. Police were called at 9.50pm on Wednesday to Cadoxton Avenue, Haringey, after receiving reports that two men had been assaulted. They were taken to a north London hospital to be treated.  A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said the incident was being treated as a hate crime. One man suffered bruising and a fractured bone in his hand while the second also suffered bruising and has an eye injury, the Shomrim neighbourhood watch team said. An 18-year-old man was arrested in Fairview Road on suspicion of actual bodily harm. He remains in custody. Ch Supt Simon Crick, who leads policing in Enfield and Haringey, said the suspect had been identified thanks to members of the public. He said: “On this most important day, this is an awful reminder that hate crime still exists. I know that Haringey residents will be upset by such a horrible attack and we won’t stand for anyone in our community being targeted or hurt. If you assault someone, you can expect us to do everything we can to investigate and find you. “I’ve been in touch with members of the local Jewish community, and I’m providing additional patrols throughout the day to reassure the community. Please do speak to them if you have any concerns.” In October, figures showed that reported hate crimes had risen by 9% to a record number of more than 124,000 across England and Wales since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. There was also an increase in antisemitism last year after the escalation of violence in Israel and Gaza, which typically results in a surge of incidents, according to the Community Security Trust. The CST recorded 1,308 such incidents nationwide between January and June 2021, a 49% increase on the same period in 2020 and the highest recorded in the first half of a year. Priti Patel described the incident as an “absolutely despicable attack”. The home secretary tweeted: “This, on the eve of Holocaust Memorial Day, is a sickening reminder of why we must never allow antisemitism to take root. We won’t tolerate abuse towards our Jewish community. “Thank you to the officers who responded swiftly to make an arrest.”",News/UK news,Teenager arrested after two Jewish men attacked in north London,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/27/teenager-arrested-after-two-jewish-men-attacked-in-north-london
1/27/2022,"Manchester United’s Amad Diallo is poised to join Rangers on loan for the rest of the season after the move was approved by Ralf Rangnick. There is no option for the Scottish champions to buy the winger, who has played only once for United in this campaign, as a substitute in the Champions League dead rubber against Young Boys. He joined from Atalanta last January and made a handful of appearances last season.  Subject to a medical, Diallo will move to Rangers, who are four points clear of Celtic at the top of the Scottish Premiership and face a Europa League play-off against Borussia Dortmund next month. Rangnick, United’s interim manager, was happy for the 19-year-old to go in search of game time. Brentford have had a £20m offer for Brennan Johnson rejected by Nottingham Forest. The fee would represent a record sale for Forest but the club are determined to keep the 20-year-old attacking midfielder, one of the Championship’s outstanding performers this season. The Wales international came through the Forest academy and has scored seven times this season. Forest are trying to sign the Blackpool winger Josh Bowler, with Millwall’s Jed Wallace another option. Southampton are in talks with Chelsea over a move for Tino Anjorin, who has cut short his loan at Lokomotiv Moscow. The 20-year-old winger moved to Russia last summer but was disrupted by a broken foot and he is back in London. There are still minor details to sort with Lokomotiv, who had a £17m option to buy, but Anjorin’s future lies elsewhere. Several Championship clubs are interested in loaning the Chelsea academy graduate and Southampton are pushing to sign him on a permanent basis. It is thought it could take about £20m for Chelsea to sell. With the window shutting on Monday, Southampton do not have much time and the deal could have to wait until the summer. Southampton also want to sign Chelsea’s Armando Broja, who is on a loan at St Mary’s, on a permanent basis. West Ham are also interested in the Albania international but Broja could decide to see whether there is a role for him at Chelsea next season.

1/27/2022,"A motorist who says he was trying to prevent a woman from being stabbed to death when he drove his car into her attacker has urged the police to reverse a decision to arrest him on suspicion of murder. Yasmine Chkaifi, 43, was repeatedly and fatally stabbed by her ex-husband Leon McCaskre, 41, on a pavement in London’s Maida Vale on Monday morning. The motorist drove his blue Renault Clio into McCaskre, killing him.  The 26-year-old driver, who identified himself only as Abraham, issued a statement through his solicitor saying he had no intention of killing McCaskre and was only trying to stop him attacking Chkaifi. He urged the police to treat him as witness rather than a suspect. “I do not see why I, as the person who tried to assist in the defence of other human beings, remain arrested and on bail under suspicion of murder,” he said. “I’ve asked my solicitor to contact the Metropolitan police to request that they consider de-arresting me and begin treating me as a witness to a tragic event rather than as a criminal. “My instant thought was to protect the woman who had been stabbed and the public who were also being threatened. The vehicles ahead of me moved off which gave me the opportunity to intervene. I drove my vehicle towards the attacker in order to get him away from the woman he was attacking. I did not intend to harm the attacker, only intended to protect those being attacked.” He added: “I have since learned that both the young lady and the attacker have died.

It was never my intention to harm him.” Maida Vale stabbing - Press Statement from our Client 'Abraham' arrested at the scene under suspicion of Murder. @metpoliceuk @WaterfordsLaw pic.twitter.com/f3WkkpmCuU More than 26,000 people have signed a petition calling for the driver not to face criminal charges and describing him as a hero. Members of Chkaifi’s family have also reportedly praised him for his attempt to save her life. A neighbour who said she used to hear McCaskre beating Chkaifi in the flat they used to share together also praised the driver. She said: “I think that man deserves a medal. It would be an absolute farce if that man got charged with anything. He saw a woman being attacked and he tried to do the best thing he could to help her. He didn’t know it was too late.” More details have emerged about McCaskre’s violence towards Chkaifi. Speaking to a friend two years ago, she reportedly said: “I think he will kill me.” Adele-Sara Richards, who knew her as Yaz, said that in April 2020 Chkaifi messaged her to say: “He’s had cameras in my house recording me for months. He’s stolen my mail, my phone, has access to all my personal data. I think he will kill me. I’ve tried everything.” One of Chkaifi’s sons told MailOnline she had been continually harassed by her ex-husband, who he said had made her life “hell”. He said: “It was a very abusive relationship which got worse after the divorce. My mother was continually being harassed and intimidated by this man. I was always in touch with the police but they did nothing to help her. There was even a panic alarm installed in our flat, that’s how scared she was of this man.
