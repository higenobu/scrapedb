1/29/2022,"TikToker Shane Brown (@shangerdanger) cracked an egg at the bottom of the ocean, and viewers couldn’t believe what happened next! Brown is a Hawaii-based diver and content creator who’s amassed a following of more than 10 million users for his videos featuring various underwater adventures. Recently, Brown posted a video where he cracks an egg at the bottom of the ocean, and the results are mesmerizing. The clip, which has 49 million views and counting, begins with GoPro footage of Brown underwater, tapping on an egg with his camera. “I heard if you crack an egg at the bottom of the ocean, something crazy happens,” Brown explains, before the footage cuts to a shot of an egg floating in the blue abyss.

Curious to see if the egg floats, Brown releases it, and to his surprise, the egg sinks. According to Brown, his first attempt at cracking the egg proves unsuccessful, as his thumbnails weren’t strong enough. So he returns to the surface for a breath before heading back down to break it with his other camera.  As he begins to break open the egg, the egg whites stretch from both sides of the shell, almost like taffy. Brown then slowly peels off the rest of the shell to reveal a gelatinous yolk surrounded by clear egg whites. The egg looks right at home, floating in the ocean like a jellyfish. However, its underwater adventure is short-lived. When Brown makes a quick trip to the surface, he discovers that a fish has eaten the entire egg, leaving behind scraps of yolk. Viewers were amused by Brown’s “egg-speriment” and took to the comments to crack a few jokes.  “Fish later that day: ‘Bro, you won’t believe what happened,’” wrote one user. “Better love story than Twilight,” one TikToker commented.  “I feel like I just watched a real-life cartoon,” observed another viewer.  Brown vows to crack another egg in the ocean, but next time, he’ll protect it from any curious sea critters on the hunt for eggs à la ocean.

1/29/2022,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — The U.S. government is warning Americans to avoid a hospital at a Mexican beach destination, following years of complaints that the facility preyed on Americans by overcharging, bullying them and refusing to release medical records. More than 100,000 U.S. tourists arrive to Los Cabos at the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula each month, drawn my its beaches and dramatic desert landscape. It appears they are not only a boon to the hotels and restaurants of twin towns Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo, but also St. Luke's Hospital in Cabo San Lucas. Multiple complaints have been filed by U.S. citizens saying the hospital demanded tens of thousands of dollars in advance payments, threatened patients’ relatives and refused to release clinical reports on what care they had actually provided. That led the U.S. consulate in Tijuana to issue the unusual “health alert” Wednesday about St. Luke's business practices. “U.S. citizens have reported instances of withholding care for payment, failing to provide itemized lists of charges, ordering unnecessary procedures, withholding U.S. passports, obstructing medical evacuations, and refusing to discharge patients without payment,” the consulate said in the alert. The hospital refused to comment when contacted by phone and email Thursday. The consulate urged U.S. citizens to go to other hospitals listed on the consulate's web page. There is some evidence that St. Luke’s pays or otherwise compensates ambulances and hotels to send American patients there. The consulate wrote, “Please be advised that hotels and resorts in the Los Cabos area may have existing contracts or informal relationships with St. Luke’s. ” That was an apparent reference to reports in local media that the hospital pays ambulance drivers to channel American patients to St. Luke's. The practice is apparently longstanding. An English-language forum for travelers and residents of Los Cabos posted a comment six years ago that read “Be aware that St. Luke’s has ambulance chasers out all the time.” “Apparently the drivers are paid a healthy fee for picking you up off the street and bringing you to St. Luke’s,"" according to the post by a travel agent. ""My Cabo friends told me that as long as I could talk to keep screaming DO NOT TAKE ME TO St. Luke’s!!!” Perhaps one of the most heart-wrenching accounts was written in a formal complaint filed in August by Scott Lairson, a Los Angeles man whose wife, Patricia Lairson, was rushed to St. Luke's while the couple were vacationing there in June. She was diagnosed with acute respiratory failure and pneumonia due to COVID-19. Patricia Lairson had serious breathing problems and was treated at St. Luke’s for 12 days. She got good treatment but the hospital administrators were extremely aggressive, telling her husband they would transfer his wife to the community hospital if he didn’t immediately pay $50,000 and that he would be unable to visit if he didn’t pay. He put $10,000 on his credit card but had no more money. Eventually he paid $25,000 to get her flown to Arizona, where she died. The hospital has billed his insurance company, United Healthcare, $1 million, but never supplied the specific medical records of each treatment to justify that billing. Lairson wrote that Mario Trejo Becerril, the hospital director, told him ""I want that deposit today, you go outside and call your family, whoever you need to call or don’t come back to this hospital.” “And if I ever hear about you recording conversations with your phone, you will never see your wife again!” Lairson recounted. __ Spagat reported from San Diego.",U.S./Associated Press,US Consulate warns Los Cabos hospital preys on Americans,https://news.yahoo.com/us-consulate-warns-los-cabos-191603434.html
1/29/2022,"A race against time is under way for the US Navy to reach one of its downed fighter jets - before the Chinese get there first. The $100m (£74m) F35-C plane came down in the South China Sea after what the Navy describes as a ""mishap"" during take-off from the USS Carl Vinson. The jet is the Navy's newest, and crammed with classified equipment. As it is in international waters, it is technically fair game. Whoever gets there first, wins. The prize? All the secrets behind this very expensive, leading-edge fighting force.  Seven sailors were injured when the jet came down on Monday after it struck Vinson's deck during a military exercise.  It is now lying on the ocean bed, but what happens next is a mystery. The Navy will not confirm either where it came down or how long it will take to retrieve it. How much G-Force can a BBC journalist take before passing out?

BBC Seoul Correspondent Laura Bicker takes to the skies in a supersonic fighter jet to report on South Korea’s drive to stand on its own two feet militarily.

But first, she does some gruelling centrifuge training to get a feel of the massive G-Forces fighter pilots work under.

Produced by Wonjung Bae. China claims almost the entire South China Sea and has increasingly taken steps to assert that claim in recent years, refusing to recognise a 2016 international tribunal ruling saying it had no legal basis. National security experts say Chinese military would be ""very keen"" to get to the jet but a US salvage vessel looks to be at least 10 days away from the crash site. That's too late, says defence consultant Abi Austen, because the black box battery will die before then, making it harder to locate the aircraft.  ""It's vitally important the US gets this back,"" she says. ""The F-35 is basically like a flying computer. It's designed to link up other assets - what the Air Force calls 'linking sensors to shooters'."" What might happen next in the South China Sea? China doesn't have that technology so getting their hands on it would give them a huge leap forward, she says. ""If they can get into the 35's networking capabilities, it effectively undermines the whole carrier philosophy."" Asked if there were echoes of the Cold War here, she says: ""It's all about who's the biggest dog in the park! This is basically The Hunt For Red October meets The Abyss - it's a brilliant three-act play."" a network-enabled mission system that allows real-time sharing of information it collects while in flight US Navy's first ""low observable"" carrier-based aircraft which enables it to operate undetected in enemy airspace larger wings and more robust landing gear make it suitable for ""catapult launches"" from carriers at sea has the most powerful fighter engine in the world and it can hit speeds of up to 1,200 mph, or Mach 1.6 can carry up to two missiles on its wings and four inside Ms Austen, a former adviser to the US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and former senior Nato and EU diplomat, said she believes any attempt by China to try to claim salvage rights was them ""stress testing"" the US. It comes at a vulnerable and dangerous time following what some perceived as a disorganised and disastrous Afghanistan pull-out, she believes. There is no doubt China wants this plane, although cyber espionage may mean they already have some knowledge of its interior, layout and workings, says Bryce Barros, a China affairs analyst and security fellow at the Truman Project. ""I think they would want to see actual parts of the plane, to better understand how it is laid out and find its vulnerabilities."" The US Navy acknowledged in a statement that a recovery operation was under way following the ""mishap"" aboard USS Carl Vinson. So how would the retrieval actually work? A team from the US Navy Supervisor of Salvage and Diving would attach bags to the jet's fuselage which will then be slowly inflated to raise the wreckage.  This operation will be more difficult if the airframe is not largely in one piece.  The aircraft was likely to have been armed with at least a couple of missiles carried either on its wings or in the internal weapons bay which could also complicate recovery.  There is precedent for these winner-takes-all military cat and mouse games. In 1974, at the height of the Cold War, the CIA secretly pulled a Russian submarine from the sea floor off the coast of Hawaii using a giant mechanical claw  Two years earlier, the Chinese military secretly salvaged the UK submarine HMS Poseidon which sank off China's east coast. And it is widely believed that China got its hands on the wreckage of a secret US ""stealth"" helicopter that crash-landed in the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in 2011. Mr Barros said: ""We are sure the Chinese military got to see the onboard equipment and software then."" The Guinness World Record-holding deepest successful salvage operation was the raising of the wreckage of a US Navy transport aircraft from the floor of the Philippine Sea in May 2019.  It was some 5,638m (18,500 ft) below the surface, One other option, of course, is to destroy the jet to stop it getting into the hands of Beijing. ""The easiest thing to do would be to torpedo it!"" said one military officer. But that's not thought to be an avenue under consideration.",World/BBC,F35-C fighter jet: Race is on to reach sunken US plane... before China,https://news.yahoo.com/f35-c-fighter-jet-race-165115780.html
1/29/2022,"KENOSHA - Kyle Rittenhouse's rifle will be dismantled at the state crime lab in April, and he will get to keep nearly $1 million of the crowd-funded bail that was posted to keep him out of jail during his homicide trial last year. At a short hearing Friday, Judge Bruce Schroeder approved two deals — one, agreed to by Rittenhouse, was to let authorities destroy the rifle; the other was to divvy up the $2 million bail with actor Ricky Schroder and a Texas non-profit organization led by Atlanta lawyer Lin Wood. Under the agreement, $920,000 will be paid, in trust, to Richards & Dimmer, the Racine law firm that defended Rittenhouse. Another $925,000 will go to #FightBack Foundation. Schroder, who posed with Rittenhouse soon after he was released on bail, gets back $150,000 he contributed. The judge denied an 11th-hour attempt by a California-based hedge fund trust to claim the bail money. The trust claims to be the assignee of a litigation financing company that was owed millions of dollars by Rittenhouse's first attorney, John Pierce of Los Angeles, and had obtained judgments against him. The trust claimed its right to all assets of Pierce's firm and business entities included the bail, since he posted the $2 million with a check from his firm's account. Rittenhouse's attorney, Mark Richards, argued Friday the money was wired to Pierce's firm from #FightBack, and went through Pierce's client trust account, so the money would never be subject to liens by business creditors. In an affidavit, the trust's officer in charge of recovering assets from Pierce also claimed that despite Pierce's huge debt, the trust decided to contribute $300,000 to Rittenhouse's bail as an investment. ""That's quite a leap of faith for any prosecution,"" Schroeder said. ""A good investment? I know hedge funds take risks, but this is bizarre."" After Richards argued there was no evidence of such an investment, Schroeder agreed to disburse the bail as Rittenhouse, #FightBack and Schroder agreed, and not wait until further litigation from the hedge fund trust. Rittenhouse did not attend Friday's hearing. Richards would not say where Rittenhouse is living but said he is preparing to go back to college and is now interested in a possible ""legal career."" A Kenosha County jury acquitted Rittenhouse, 19, in November of five counts, including homicide. He said he acted in self-defense when he killed two people and wounded a third during protests in August 2020. He used a Smith & Wesson M&P rifle that an older friend bought for him in May 2020 at a Rusk County hardware store. Rittenhouse was 17 at the time and couldn't legally purchase a firearm. The weapon was evidence at Rittenhouse's trial, and retained as evidence in a separate case against Dominick Black for providing the gun to a minor. Those charges were dismissed after Black, 20, pleaded no contest earlier this month to a non-criminal citation for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Richards said Black had also expressed interest in claiming the gun, and that Rittenhouse was concerned Black might try to sell it for rumored six-figure offers. ""We didn't think anyone should profit it from it,"" Richards said. Authorities returned Rittenhouse's clothing and cellphone to Richards on Wednesday. He said he will mail them to Rittenhouse. Kenosha Joint Services will hold the rifle until it sends a routine batch of firearms to the state crime lab for destruction, likely in April, said Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger. The lab will record the process and present the video to Richards as proof the gun was destroyed, Binger said. While Friday's hearing marked the end of Rittenhouse's criminal case, he could still face civil litigation over the shootings. The parents of one of his victims, Anthony Huber, earlier this month moved to amend their federal civil rights lawsuit against Kenosha officials to add Rittenhouse as a defendant. The motion notes the plaintiffs waited so as not to interfere with the criminal prosecution against Rittenhouse. The judge in the federal case has not yet agreed to accept the amended complaint.
