3/1/2022,"By Andrew Hay and Rod Nickel (Reuters) - A Texas software developer and a cook in British Columbia are among dozens of Americans and Canadians answering Ukraine's call for foreign volunteers to fight Russia's invasion. With their governments refusing to send troops to Ukraine out of fear of sparking a world war, Americans and Canadians told Reuters they were inspired by Ukrainians' fierce resistance. Many believe their democratic rights will be threatened at home if they do nothing to defend Europe. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on Sunday for the formation of an ""international legion."" Some young volunteers are travelling straight to Ukraine to enlist. Others are applying at Ukrainian embassies and consulates before quitting jobs or dropping out of university. The mobilization was taking place as Russian artillery bombarded Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv on Monday, the fifth day of conflict. ""I feel guilty to not go,"" said Dax, 26, a veteran of the elite U.S. 82nd Airborne Division infantry, who planned to deploy with other former U.S. military personnel. Like many volunteers, the Alabama native declined to give his full name amid discussion on social media of the need to keep their identities and movements secret for security reasons. Canadian Bryson Woolsey quit his job as a cook on Sunday after seeing Zelenskiy's appeal. He has no military training and plans to buy a plane ticket to Poland, cross into Ukraine and volunteer for combat. ""I felt like I had to do something,"" said Woolsey, 33, of Powell River, British Columbia, who became restless as he watched images of wounded women and children in Ukraine. Canada's Foreign Minister Melanie Joly on Sunday told reporters it was up to individual Canadians to decide whether they wanted to join Ukraine's international brigade. The U.S. Department of State did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Not all volunteers want to fight. In Quebec, 35-year-old physician Julien Auger was preparing to leave his young family to become a medic with Ukraine's health ministry and provide ""neutral"" humanitarian aid. ""Global opinion and support is the key right now to solving the conflict,"" said Auger, a father of two who provides palliative care at a hospital in Saint-Jérôme. In online groups, military veterans warned volunteers with no combat training they were heading into a conflict where inexperience could be a liability for themselves and others. That did not stop those like Tai B., 23, who studied journalism in New York. ""I'm not looking to be a hero, or a martyr, I just want to finally do something right,"" said Tai, who can cook, do basic mechanics and knows how to handle a firearm. He has contacted Ukraine's U.S. Embassy about enlisting in Zelenskiy's ""international legion."" Hyde, a 28-year-old from the U.S. Midwest, said he was already in Kyiv and expected to start military training on Tuesday. ""I cannot bear the thought of Europe once again being plunged into warfare,"" said Hyde, who described himself as a gun enthusiast and avid survivalist with no combat experience. He expects to be given a helmet, body armor, knee pads and eventually a rifle. In Austin, Texas, a software developer said he would draw on his experience as a U.S. Army cadet to fight for Ukraine. ""If they're willing to defend democracy then I think those that benefit from a democratic society are duty bound to support them,"" said the 25-year-old, who asked that his name not be used. ""I'm not telling my parents until I head to the airport.""

3/1/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last week prompted major economic sanctions by Western countries that are already causing a serious disruption to Russia's economy and its citizens. Following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s announcement last week that he would recognize the independence of the separatist republics of ​​Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, President Joe Biden imposed new sanctions beyond what the U.S. had already leveled against Russia in 2014 after it had annexed the former Ukrainian Crimean Peninsula. On Feb. 21, Biden issued an executive order that placed severe restrictions on trade with the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The next day, he announced additional sanctions against two large Russian banks, VEB and Russian military bank PSB. Biden also said the U.S. would prohibit the secondary market for Russian bonds issued after March 1, which he said would block the country from raising money from the West. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, facing pressure from the U.S. and other world leaders, said on Feb. 22 that Germany would halt certification of the Nord stream 2 Baltic sea pipeline, which would double the flow of Russian gas to Germany. Meanwhile, U.K Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined the U.S. with what he called a “first barrage” of sanctions targeting five Russian banks and three billionaire members of Putin’s inner circle. The European Union imposed sanctions on 351 members of the Russian legislature’s lower house that voted to recognize the independence of the two Ukrainian separatist regions. On Feb. 24, after Russia continued its invasion of Ukraine, Biden tightened the screws further by blocking tech exports to Russia to limit its military and aerospace sectors as well as adding additional targeted sanctions against Russian banks. With this step, all of Russia’s largest financial institutions, representing 80% of all banking assets in the country and almost 90 financial institution subsidiaries worldwide are targeted, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. “Treasury is taking serious and unprecedented action to deliver swift and severe consequences to the Kremlin and significantly impair their ability to use the Russian economy and financial system to further their malign activity,” Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen said in a statement. On Monday, the U.S., the U.K., Canada, and the European Commission took further steps against Russia's financial system by removing some Russian banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT, which 11,000 financial institutions globally use to send secure messages about financial transactions. They also restricted the Russian Central Banks’ access to most of its reserves —$643 billion in foreign currency— to make it more difficult for the country to soften the blow of the sanctions. Also on Monday, investor's weighed in by sending Russia's currency, the Ruble, tumbling. Within hours, it lost a quarter of its value and is now worth less than a U.S. penny. To try to control the situation, Russia’s central bank more than doubled a key interest rate, banned foreigners from selling Russian securities, and ordered exporters to convert revenues in foreign currency to Rubles. The financial instability caused Russians to line up at banks to withdraw their savings. Because of the precipitous fall in the value of the Ruble, millions of Russians lost a huge chunk of their net worth. There were also long lines inside Moscow's metro, as riders fumbled for cash to buy tickets after Apple Pay and Google Pay stopped working in the country.
