5/2/2022,"Chicken’s relative affordability has helped make it the country’s meat of choice but one of the UK’s biggest food retailers has warned it could soon be as pricey as beef as production costs soar. Steve Murrells, chief executive of the Co-op, said feed costs had become a huge challenge for the poultry industry. “Chicken could become as expensive as beef. Chicken, which was incredibly cheap and great value for money, is rising quicker than any other protein.” Chicken is the country’s most popular meat, with consumption levels far outstripping beef, lamb or pork. At a time when household food bills are already rising, higher priced chicken is likely to have a disproportionate impact on lower income families. Consumers were warned at the end of last year that prices needed to go up to reflect the true cost of producing food by 2 Sisters, the UK’s biggest poultry supplier. “How can it be right that a whole chicken costs less than a pint of beer?” said Ranjit Singh Boparan, the owner of Bernard Matthews and 2 Sisters Food Group, at the time. Boparan, whose facilities in the UK and Europe process more than 10 million birds a week, said labour shortages and commodity price rises meant less choice and higher prices. This inflationary picture has been exacerbated by the fresh price shock caused by the Russia-Ukraine war. In a March update 2 Sisters said its input costs – of which feed is the biggest component – had rocketed. “Prices from the farm gate have already risen by almost 50% in a year,” it said. The ingredients that go into chicken feed include, soya, sunflower meal (a byproduct of sunflower oil) and wheat, all of which have risen in price. In normal times Ukraine and Russia are major sunflower oil and wheat producers. Fast food chains like Nando’s and KFC are among the big high street names to have increased their price in recent months. However, a whole bird can still be bought for less than £3 in the supermarket. At the moment Tesco, the UK’s biggest, is price matching Aldi on a whole chicken at £2.89 – or £2.07 per kg. Tesco’s cheapest beef mince is £3.78 per kg. Office for National Statistics data shows the average retail price of chicken has increased by 31p, or nearly 12%, to £2.98 per kg in the last 12 months. For beef mince the price per kg is £6.78, on the back of a similar rise. The price per kg for the two meats is more closely matched on top-end products, such as organic ranges. Murrells, speaking at the Retail & eCommerce directors’ forum, said customers might switch to other meats or vegan alternatives if the price of chicken continued to soar. “Customers will have to be savvy about what they can afford,” he said. “They’ll buy a chicken, they’ll have it for a roast on a Sunday, but then they’ll use the giblets and whatever to make a soup. Customers will find creative ways of making food last longer.”",Lifestyle/Food,Rising feed prices mean chicken could soon cost as much as beef,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/may/01/rising-feed-prices-mean-chicken-could-soon-cost-as-much-as-beef
5/2/2022,"Where would Tottenham be without Harry Kane and Son Heung-min? It’s a question that Spurs supporters must hope they never have to answer after watching the deadly duo ensure Antonio Conte’s side maintained their push for a top-four finish despite a less than vintage performance against Leicester’s B-team. Kane’s 13th Premier League goal of the season – courtesy of an assist from Son, of course – set Spurs on their way in the first half, before Dejan Kulusevski, on as a substitute, got in on the act to set up Son for both his 18th and then a spectacular 19th. Nonetheless, Conte will be the first to acknowledge that his team must improve considerably if they are to achieve their targets. At this rate, the north London derby on 11 May will certainly not be for the faint-hearted. The last time these sides met in January, two stoppage-time goals from Steven Bergwijn snatched a dramatic victory for Tottenham that Conte said “highlighted the spirit and commitment” of his players. But with Spurs surrendering their advantage over Arsenal in the disappointing performances against Brighton and Brentford, the Italian knew there could be no slip-ups here against understrength opposition with their eyes on a different prize. Conte surprisingly recalled Lucas Moura in place of Kulusevski, despite the Sweden forward’s impressive start to life in the Premier League, in the only change from last week, while Rodgers made no apologies for his selection that included only three of the players who started against Roma in the first leg of their Europa Conference League semi-final on Thursday. That meant Jamie Vardy had to be content with a place on the bench, with Kelechi Iheanacho and Patson Daka leading the line. After a strangely lacklustre start from the hosts, it was the latter who produced the first attempt of any significance in the 14th minute when Boubakary Soumaré’s low cross somehow picked out the Zambia striker and his effort was pushed onto the post by Hugo Lloris. Tottenham escaped another difficult moment soon afterwards when replays suggested Son had handled the ball in the penalty area under pressure from Ayoze Pérez, but no action was taken. Luckily for Spurs, they are able to call on the most prolific attacking partnership in Premier League history and the 41st combination between Son and Kane midway through the first half was as simple as they come. Daniel Amartey was culpable for allowing the England captain plenty of time to stoop and head in from a pinpoint corner from his South Korean accomplice to open the scoring – 211 minutes after they had last registered a shot on target against Aston Villa on 9 April. Nampalys Mendy almost gifted Kane his second 10 minutes later with a sloppy backpass that forced Kasper Schmeichel into action. At the other end, Iheanacho fired just wide of the post from outside the box before a delightful piece of skill from Pérez set up another opportunity for Leicester, with his scuffed shot just eluding the Nigerian’s lunge. With Leicester also enjoying the lion’s share of possession, Conte must have stressed the need for an improved performance from his players at half-time but once more Tottenham were slow out of the blocks. The introduction of Kulusevski for the ineffective Moura less than 10 minutes in was at least recognition that his tinkering had not worked this time, with the substitute almost making an immediate impact with a mazy dribble before losing his balance at the vital moment. But, after two crunching tackles from the outstanding Cristian Romero turned over possession just inside the Leicester half, it was Kulusevski’s clever pass that allowed Son acres of space to swivel and shoot past the helpless Schmeichel. Son could have doubled his tally soon afterwards, only to fail to make significant contact on Rodrigo Bentancur’s accurate cross from the left flank to allow Leicester’s goalkeeper to make the save. There was no stopping his next attempt, however. Nothing looked on when Kulusevski rolled the ball back to Son on the edge of the penalty area, but a curling shot that dipped just below the crossbar gave Schmeichel no chance and left Leicester with no way back. Iheanacho’s goal in stoppage time that beat Lloris via his near post was merely a consolation.",Sport/Football,Son Heung-min leads Tottenham past Leicester to bolster top-four bid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/01/tottenham-leicester-premier-league-match-report
5/2/2022,"Poorer areas have been hit disproportionally by a combination of cuts to neighbourhood services such as parks, libraries, refuse collection and children’s centres that have left English councils “hollowed out” since 2010, a major report into local government has concluded. The study by the Institute for Government thinktank found that while some councils coped better than others, and reduced spending did not necessarily mean worse results, a lack of information made it difficult to learn lessons. There are currently performance indicators for only about a third of local government spending, the report said, with better data needed if ministers wanted to implement their stated plan to “level up” different areas of the country. Based on analysis of spending and outcomes, as well as anonymous interviews with council chief executives and chief finance officers, the report highlighted a series of sometimes unintended consequences from the severe cuts that began with austerity policies in 2010. The combination of reduced central grants and growing expenditure on mandatory adult and child social care obligations meant a significant fall in basic services. All English local authorities had reduced spending on such provision since 2010, the report found, but the extent of this varied from a 5% cut in in East Sussex to 69% in Barking and Dagenham. The impact was often felt in more deprived areas, which saw a disproportionate number of library closures and reductions in local bus routes. This was, the report said, because the way grants were changed over the past decade did not take proper account of how poorer areas were more dependent on central government help. But the report, Neighbourhood Services Under Strain, noted that there was no noticeable correlation between the reduction in spending and worse performance, with some councils more successfully managing efficiencies or being able to raise revenues from other sources. It was, however, difficult to learn lessons due to a lack of information. Despite ministerial pledges to provide more data as part of levelling up efforts, “there are still big gaps in what the government knows about local service performance”, said Graham Atkins, the report’s author. He said: “If the government truly wants to understand how and why performance varies, it will have to collect new, comparable local data on the quality and accessibility of services.” A key change to the provision of council services since 2010, the report found, has been a focus on providing statutory services, not just in social care but areas such as waste collection, homelessness, and bus passes, with often inadvertent knock-on effects. One example cited was a prioritisation of acute child services at the expense of those such as children’s centres, even though this could cost more money in the long term if the lack of early support created more demand for statutory services later on. Economies on waste disposal and recycling have meant that while less rubbish was now sent to landfill, it was simply more likely to be incinerated, with the proportion being recycled barely rising since 2010. An example cited in the report about the difficulty of comparing local authority services was the impact on libraries. A third of all libraries have closed amid a 44% reduction in spending since 2010. There is, however, little relationship between spending and closures, because many cost savings come through means such as fewer staff and reduced opening hours. The effect has been a 52% reduction in the number of library visits per person between 2009/10 and 2019/20. “The overall picture is of smaller local authorities, doing less than they did in 2010,” the report found. “Local government in England has been hollowed out since 2010.” The Department for Levelling up, Housing and Communities was contacted for comment.",News/Society,Local government in England ‘hollowed out’ under Conservatives,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/01/local-government-in-england-hollowed-out-under-conservatives
5/2/2022,"Government sources have played down the idea of a cabinet split over a possible windfall tax on energy companies as the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, firmly quashed the idea, days after it was mooted by the chancellor. In a search for solutions to a crisis over energy prices, and the cost of living more widely, Rishi Sunak said a windfall tax, as advocated by Labour, was possible if energy companies did not properly reinvest bumper profits. Asked if he backed the chancellor’s idea, Kwarteng told Sky News: “I’ve never been a supporter of windfall taxes. I have been very clear on that publicly, I think it discourages investment and the reason why we want to have investment is because it creates jobs, it creates wealth and it also gives us energy security.” Sunak told Mumsnet on Wednesday he was also concerned that a windfall tax could put off investment in new oil and gas extraction, but added: “If we don’t see that type of investment coming forward and companies are not going to make those investments in our country and energy security, then of course that’s something I would look at and nothing is ever off the table in these things.” Asked on Sky about Sunak’s views, Kwarteng said: “He is the chancellor of the exchequer, he is responsible for tax policy. From my point of view, I want to see investment in the North Sea.” Questioned about whether he disagreed with Sunak, Kwarteng said: “My view is that, and I’ve said this publicly many times, a windfall tax will act as a disincentive to invest and we want to see investment.” Treasury and business department sources rejected the idea of a split, saying both ministers held the same view of not seeking a windfall tax, but not ruling it out if energy companies did not provide sufficient new investment. In a letter to oil and gas companies, also released to the media, Kwarteng called on them to invest in new domestic energy production as a way to help bring down bills. “In return for the UK government’s ongoing support for the sector, the prime minister, the chancellor and I want to see a very clear plan from the oil and gas industry to reinvest profits in the North Sea and, importantly, in the clean energy technologies of the future,” he wrote. Labour, which has argued that a one-off, 12-month windfall levy would contribute £1.2bn towards wider efforts to reduce energy bills, dismissed the letter as ineffective. Ed Miliband, shadow climate change secretary, said: “Kwasi Kwarteng’s letter is not worth the paper it is written on for millions of families facing the cost of living crisis. Families want action to deal with the bills crisis, not a vacuous, insulting piece of political spin.”",News/Business,Kwarteng and Sunak at odds over windfall tax on oil and gas profits,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/01/kwasi-kwarteng-sunak-windfall-tax-oil-gas
