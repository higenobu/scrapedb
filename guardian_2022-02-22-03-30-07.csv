2/22/2022,"Two environmental activists have been convicted of charges relating to a protest against HS2 after occupying a 100ft-high drilling rig to highlight damage they claimed the rail project was causing to London’s drinking water supply. James Brown, 57, a partially sighted former Paralympian cycling champion, and James Ruggles 25, appeared at Uxbridge magistrates court charged with criminal damage and aggravated trespass after a protest in February 2020 when they climbed on to drilling machinery in the Colne Valley, Hillingdon.  Both spent several hours on the rig and unfurled a banner which said: “Protect London’s drinking water: stop HS2”. They and other environmental campaigners claimed the pile driving into a chalk aquifer in the Colne Valley posed a risk to 20% of the city’s drinking water supply. Brown was cleared of the criminal damage charge but found guilty of the aggravated trespass charge. Ruggles was found guilty of both charges. The men were given conditional discharges. The activists told the court they carried out the protest on the drilling rig to raise awareness about the environmental damage they believe HS2’s work was causing. “Because I have a bit of a public profile I believed that by being present on the day I might be able to attract public attention through the media,” Brown told the court. District judge Andrew Johnson said in his ruling that while he did not doubt the sincerity of the defendants, if this sort of conduct was not punished “it would lead to anarchy.” He added: “There has to be a line drawn.” Speaking after the ruling, Brown said: “This is one of an increasing number of climate and environment-related cases. I think in the months to come we will be seeing many more. Awareness of these issues amongst members of the public is massively on the rise. Our government is simply not tackling the climate crisis with the energy it requires.” An HS2 spokesperson said: “HS2 take our responsibilities incredibly seriously and we have a world-leading team of engineers, hydrogeologists, and environmental scientists in place to ensure that the construction of the Colne Valley viaduct affords the right protection for the environment, and is completed as safely and efficiently as possible. As a result, we have almost completed half the piling for the viaduct, with no impact on public water supply.”",News/UK news,Activists who occupied 100ft HS2 drilling rig convicted over protest,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/21/activists-100ft-hs2-drilling-rig-convicted-protest-paralympian-london-drinking-water
2/22/2022,"Nesrine Malik (Scared to be ‘woke’? It’s time for progressives to take a stand in the culture wars, 21 February) sets out the bemusing battlefield surrounding the concept of being “woke” and how it has been weaponised by the right wing of Conservative repression. Part of the issue is clearly the way different groups and factions define the meaning of woke. She correctly deduces that Labour needs to own it. We have already been pointed in the necessary direction by a man speaking in the saddest of situations. Dave Merritt, the father of the young lawyer Jack Merritt, who was killed in the London Bridge terror attack in 2019, gave a moving speech after his son’s inquest. He described how proud his son would have been to be called woke. He defined its meaning very simply as “the opposite of ignorant”.Ric CareySouthsea, Hampshire   Nesrine Malik expresses the problem brilliantly. But I’m so angry I couldn’t read her piece all in one go. Angry because it’s impossible to imagine anyone on Labour’s current frontbench saying anything a tenth as powerful, and angry that I, and many thousands of other members, were gulled into believing that Keir Starmer had a fairly radical and progressive agenda. He must have known perfectly well that he would never get elected if we knew then that he would align himself so completely, whether through conviction or tactics, with Labour’s right wing.Richard BarnesWindermere, Cumbria  The weaknesses of the west are not the result of a “painful woke psychodrama”, as the Tory party chairman Oliver Dowden claims (Report, 14 February). His slur is simply another distraction for those who are angry that the high-skilled, high-wage jobs promised by the neoliberals never materialised. We are among the largest economies in the world, yet 30% of children live in poverty and we have food banks. Years of austerity are now being followed by a catastrophic cost-of-living crisis. None of that was caused by woke ideas. Instead, the west has been divided by politicians playing fast and loose with democracy, undermining the validity of elections, refusing to take responsibility for their actions and widening the divisions between people through racist tropes. Politicians have weakened European institutions, either by undermining Nato (as Donald Trump did) or Europe itself (as the populists have done). The woke are not undermining the west. They are seeking to ensure that all are represented and have a place in society. Decolonising the curriculum is about telling a more complete picture, ensuring that everyone sees themselves reflected in a classroom and that we do not hide from the past. Spoiler alert: the empire was brutal, cruel and exploitative. It involved slavery, murder and the stealing of land and resources from other people. Perhaps understanding the past and ensuring all are represented will bring greater unity rather than the divisions Dowden claims.Prof Andrew MoranSaffron Walden, Essex  Reading Marina Hyde (You can’t erase history.

2/22/2022,"The Queen is expected to speak to Boris Johnson on Wednesday for her regular weekly update from the prime minister as she continues to recover from Covid-19. Audiences with foreign ambassadors are also expected to go ahead – also on a virtual basis – as the monarch remains in self-isolation at her home in Windsor.  A day after testing positive for the virus – which Buckingham Palace said on Sunday was manifesting itself in the form of “mild cold-like symptoms” – the Queen was still undertaking light duties in her capacity as head of state. Messages of goodwill continued to be issued by organisations in the UK and overseas representatives while Boris Johnson told MPs in parliament that the Queen’s positive test was a reminder that the virus “has not gone away”. Her work on Monday included sending a condolence to the people of Brazil after flooding in the city of Petrópolis. “I am deeply saddened to hear of the tragic loss of life and destruction caused by the terrible floods in Brazil,” she wrote, in a message which was posed online by the royal family’s official Twitter account. “My thoughts and prayers are with all those who have lost their lives, loved ones and homes, as well as the emergency services and all those working to support the recovery efforts.” But while the Queen’s conversation with the prime minister on Wednesday will not take place face to face, campaigners and advocates for elderly people said that many of those among a cohort of more than 1.3 million people who continued to work over the age of 65 included some in public facing roles who had no choice but to keep on working. The relaxation of Covid restrictions and the ending of self-isolation was a source of worry for many people aged 65 and over, said Morgan Vine, head of policy and influencing at Independent Age. “We are concerned that this sudden change in direction of public safety is likely to increase anxiety among older people, and even cause some to shield themselves and limit daily activities.” The charity added that recent research – between 9 and 13 February – had shown that the challenges faced by those in later life due to the pandemic have worsened many people’s mental health. “If the requirement to isolate is removed, this fear is likely to increase alongside the likelihood of coming into contact with someone who has Covid,” said Vine, speaking a few hours before Johnson’s announcement that the requirement to self-isolate after testing positive will end on Thursday in England. Concerns that many in the older population were deeply anxious about making a transition back to a more normal way of life were also echoed by the UK’s largest charity for older people, Age UK. Ruth Isden, head of health and care influencing at Age UK, said it was going to take time and effort to reassure people and that it was important that government messaging carefully explained the next steps when it came to those who were elderly and others, such as people who were clinically vulnerable. “We are in a very different position and vaccines have made a huge difference but it’s important that the government explains and reassures peoples it moves forward with its plans.” “If you are in an older age group and have had your vaccinations, and then have kept them up to date then you are in a much better place, but we have to keep on reassuring people, as well as recognising that it’s not just simply a case how we feel about ourselves. We need to be cautious an careful when it comes to others.” Rowan Hardwood, professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Nottingham, reiterated the message of other experts that those who have been vaccinated and had kept it up to date, at no matter what age, were in a radically different position to anyone who had not had a jab. But he added: “It is important to recognise that the situation with older people can vary much more than other groups. Virtually anyone by the age of 90 is frail and by frail we mean vulnerable and prone to deterioration. “If you have contracted the virus and are quite well to the extent that you are managing to do daily activities, then the vaccine will stand you in good stead. That would apply to anyone of any age.”",News/UK news,Queen to speak to PM in weekly update from self-isolation,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/21/queen-to-speak-to-pm-in-weekly-update-from-self-isolation

2/22/2022,"Russian forces are “creating lists of identified Ukrainians to be killed or sent to camps” in the event of an invasion, according to a letter sent by the US to the UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet. Citing “disturbing information recently obtained by the United States” the letter, from the US ambassador to the UN, Bathsheba Crocker, warns that “we have credible information” that target lists have been drawn up by “Russian forces”.  It warns that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would create a “human rights catastrophe” and that further abuses are being planned, which have previously included “targeted killings, kidnappings/forced disappearances, unjust detentions, and the use of torture”. A few hours later Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, said that Russia’s plans for Ukraine were “extremely violent” – and it was necessary to lay out the threat in the letter for the UN. “We also have intelligence to suggest that there will be an even greater form of brutality because this will not simply be some conventional war between two armies. It will be a war waged by Russia on the Ukrainian people, to repress them, crush them, to harm them,” he said. Evidence to back up the US statements is relatively limited. The warnings are part of the wider western strategy to highlight what are believed to be Putin’s intentions towards Ukraine, partly in an attempt to dissuade him from an invasion, and the Crocker’s letter is the latest in a string from western intelligence about the plans the Russian FSB and GRU agencies have for acting in concert with the Russian military. Last week, Foreign Policy reported that US officials had concluded that lists had been drawn up containing anybody that it believed could challenge Russia, and reported similar conclusions were being drawn by the UK and other anglophone Five Eyes intelligence partners. Britain has made more measured warnings. Earlier this month it emerged that the UK believed that the FSB has been given the task of engineering coups in Ukraine’s major cities in the immediate aftermath of any invasion. The broader plan would see Russian forces would encircle Kyiv and other major cities, leaving the spy agency the task of delivering them, as part of a strategy of “regime change” across Ukraine. Crocker, in her letter, says she was writing to the UN high commissioner for human rights because of its mandate and its presence in Ukraine. The letter states that those most likely to be targeted include “Russian and Belarusian dissidents in exile in Ukraine, journalists and anti-corruption activists, and vulnerable populations such as religious and ethnic minorities and LGBTQI+ persons”. The letter emerged after the latest flurry of diplomacy, which saw Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin approve in principle the idea of a summit between the two leaders, aimed at de-escalating the Ukraine crisis. The step – conditional on Russia not invading Ukraine – was taken with the help of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, after calls on Sunday night with the two leaders. A format for the summit is to be decided at a meeting between the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on Thursday. Further details also emerged of US sanctions plans, with Reuters reporting that the US intends to bar US financial institutions from processions transactions for major Russian banks in the event of an invasion. The report, which cites three sources, said the measures aim to hurt the Russian economy by cutting the “correspondent” banking relationships between targeted Russian banks and US banks that enable international payments. While the threat of sanctions had already been floated, the plan to cut correspondent banking ties, which underpin global money flows, had not been previously reported.",News/World news,"Russia is creating lists of Ukrainians ‘to be killed or sent to camps’, US claims",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/us-claims-russia-creating-lists-of-ukrainians-to-be-killed-or-sent-to-camps-report
2/22/2022,"The mottled ice at Curl Edinburgh was thronged with players, as competitors in a ladies’ league gracefully lunged forwards with their curling stones, arms and legs out-stretched. Teammates busily swept hard at the ice, to help the granite gain an extra few millimetres of ground. Mondays are often busy at Edinburgh’s only curling centre. But this Monday has been transformed by Team GB’s gold and silver medal triumphs at the winter Olympics. Two of the medal-winners play there, as do previous Olympic and world champions.  Aaron Forsyth, the rink’s manager, said the centre had been inundated with inquiries about the sport since the victories in Beijing. “We’ve received hundreds of emails or clicks in the last few days where people have asked to try curling,” he said. “It’s fantastic.” Part of the challenge, Forsyth said, could be accommodating them all, and particularly supporting the younger children whose interest in the game has been sparked. Guiding those 20kg (44lb) stones down the ice takes greater strength than it may seem. He believes curling is the UK’s dominant winter Olympics discipline. Team GB’s modest medal rush came late in the games and entirely from curling. After the frustrations of the mixed team coming fourth, the men’s team took silver on Saturday and then the women’s team comprehensively defeated Japan 10-3 in Sunday’s final. And Curl Edinburgh is perhaps one of the sport’s most successful venues. Open more than 12 hours a day to numerous clubs and leagues, its players drawn from the city’s banks, doctors, local teams and from nearby towns such as Peebles, it is also a popular venue for holidaymakers. Seen in the UK as an archetypally Scottish sport, Forsyth hosts school parties from England, companies from London organising staff awaydays, and large groups of friends visiting Edinburgh for stag and hen parties. “The Olympics is going to add to this,” he said. “The goal is to keep the momentum going.” Those medals could not have come at a better time, said Maggie Wilson of Scottish Curling. The organisation hopes it will produce a rise in interest from new, younger players. “The Olympics has shown how exciting it is, and really entertaining for all the ages,” Wilson said, citing the women team’s nerve-racking victory over Sweden in the semi-finals. One of the game’s youngest ambassadors is Jamie Rankin, an 18-year-old student from a curling dynasty. His mother, Janice Rankin, was part of Great Britain’s gold medal-winning team at the Salt Lake City winter games in 2002; his grandmother Barbara was playing in a league competition at Curl Edinburgh on Monday morning while he worked part-time in its cafe upstairs. Rankin, a business student originally from Elgin, coaches Edinburgh University’s curling team. And he is “100%” clear about his ambition. “I want to go to the Olympics one day. That’s what I’m working towards, definitely.” He believes the sport will attract younger competitors. At home in Elgin, the local youth team was 25 to 30 strong. “I have got a couple of my friends watching it, and they’re always messaging me, saying, ‘Why are they doing this?’ or ‘What does that mean?’ I’m going to get them to come along.” The sport has had a difficult pandemic. It is chiefly played in the winter and almost entirely on indoor rinks. And even though Team GB’s medal winners are in their 20s and 30s, most of curling’s active players are middle-aged or older. Scotland’s rinks were closed by lockdowns over the winter of 2020-21, and again in October last year, just three weeks after the season began. Older players were reluctant to congregate in indoor venues, and many drifted away. Scottish Curling estimates that about a tenth of its 10,000 members gave up the sport during the Covid crisis. The sport’s greatest challenge, Wilson said, is keeping its youth players involved in the sport once they leave home for university or their first full-time job. Then the participation rates take a steep dive. Dave Leith, the head of performance support with British Curling, the sport’s competition organisation, said: “It’s quite a big challenge. We’ve already started to crack that nut to some degree because we’ve got a lot of strength in depth now, in a way I don’t think we’ve seen for quite some time, but there’s still a lot of work to be done there.”",Sport/Sport,Winter Olympics curling triumph draws new generation to the ice,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/21/winter-olympics-curling-triumph-draws-new-generation-to-the-ice
2/22/2022,"First the interview, now the invisibility. Romelu Lukaku has mostly been a conundrum since returning to Chelsea last summer and while the £97.5m striker has not done much talking off the pitch since that ill-advised chat with Sky Italia, nothing summed up his struggles more than when he delivered a performance of record-breaking anonymity against Crystal Palace last Saturday. This was Lukaku at his most laboured, predictable and disconnected from his teammates. He touched the ball a grand total of seven times, the fewest in 90 minutes of Premier League football for any player since Opta began keeping track in 2003, and nobody was about to argue that he was merely keeping his powder dry for the big moments.  Even Thomas Tuchel, who desperately needs the Belgian to find form, is not putting a positive spin on the numbers. Chelsea’s manager understands their significance and he was unsure whether he can help Lukaku by tweaking his tactical approach when the European champions host Lille in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday night. “What can I do?” Tuchel said. “I don’t know. We have to deal with it. The data is out there and the data speaks a certain language. He was not involved in our game. It’s not what we want or Romelu wants, but it’s not the time to laugh and make jokes about him. He’s in the spotlight and we’ll protect him.” It did not sound as if the mood is going to become cheerier in the near future. True, Lukaku scored twice when Chelsea won the Club World Cup this month. Yes, he should fancy his chances of hurting Lille given that the French champions are floundering this season. But no, it would not be a great surprise if it turns out to be another evening of Lukaku waiting in vain for quick balls to be slid down the channels, his teammates ignoring his prompts and Tuchel despairing at his marquee signing looking so out of place. This was not part of the plan when Chelsea bought Lukaku. The 28-year-old had just fired Internazionale to the Serie A title and it seemed that he was going to prove similarly inspirational in Chelsea’s attempt to challenge Manchester City and Liverpool. Yet Lukaku was looking an uneasy fit even before an ankle injury further disrupted his momentum in October. An immobile presence, he does not make it easy for Chelsea to attack with fluidity. Increasingly there is a sense of Tuchel compromising his beliefs by sculpt everything around a target man and the problem is exacerbated by Chelsea’s reluctance to play to Lukaku’s strengths, often leaving him frustrated by opting for a controlled buildup. Nobody is adapting here. It is not simply down to Lukaku. Kai Havertz, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Christian Pulisic and Timo Werner are not providing for him and do not score enough. Mason Mount, who is unlikely to return from an ankle injury until Chelsea face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday, has had a stop-start campaign and Hakim Ziyech remains inconsistent despite chipping in with some important goals. In that context it is no wonder that Chelsea remain a cup team rather than one capable of challenging for the title. They do not create or shoot as much as City and Liverpool, raising questions over whether Tuchel’s tactics are too restrictive. “Maybe,” Tuchel said. “There is a history of strikers struggling at Chelsea so it is not the easiest place in the world for strikers. I don’t know exactly why. We want to be a hard-working group that is not shy to make it physical and not only a skilful game.” For Lille, that was a reminder that Chelsea still know how to play a cup tie. They conceded only twice in the knockout stages of the Champions League last season and their defensive prowess will make them contenders again. Chelsea are dangerous in these situations. Yet they cannot merely rely on their defence. They are weaker on the left without Ben Chilwell and although Reece James is close to a return on the right, contractual uncertainty hangs over three key players. César Azpilicueta could join Barcelona at the end of the season, talks with Andreas Christensen have broken down and Antonio Rüdiger is yet to sign an extension despite being offered about £170,000 a week. Gaps have appeared – gaps, though, that would be easier to hide if the attack begins to function. Ultimately Tuchel knows that he can trust his defenders. The questions are at the other end and the focus has to be on Lukaku somehow developing an understanding with his fellow forwards. They have to accept more responsibility and Tuchel has to give them a spark. A £97.5m striker having seven touches a game is unsustainable and unless something changes, it is hard to see Chelsea holding on to their European crown.",Sport/Football,Lukaku’s unwanted record is cause for concern in Chelsea’s trophy chase | Jacob Steinberg,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/21/lukakus-unwanted-record-is-cause-for-concern-in-chelseas-trophy-chase
2/22/2022,"Health and the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic are a significant drag on the Coalition vote, with one in three Australians less likely to vote for the Morrison government due to the level of public hospital funding, according to new polling. An Essential poll, commissioned by the Australian Medical Association, found voters who had traditionally supported the Coalition on health and hospital funding were now deserting them. Support in this key area had dropped, with 34% now questioning the government’s record.  Only the Morrison government’s handling of the climate crisis and cost of living pressures registered greater levels of disapproval. Of those polled, 37% were less likely to vote for the government on climate, while 38% were not supportive of Morrison on cost of living. The poll of 1,069 voters was conducted from 3 to 6 February, before a torrid parliamentary fortnight in which the Morrison government dropped its religious discrimination bill and pivoted to national security to recover its poor standing in the polls. On Friday states and territories reiterated their demand for the commonwealth to provide 50% of public hospital funding, up from 45%, and abandon a 6.5% growth cap on health funding. States believe the cost-sharing deal struck during the Covid-19 pandemic is not fit-for-purpose now coronavirus is circulating in the community, as it does not keep up with increased staffing costs, PPE and expected new demand from delayed care and long-Covid. Despite the pressure from the states in the lead-up to the 2022 election, the AMA is yet to secure a commitment from either side of politics for 50-50 funding, with Labor more focused on GP and specialist out-of-pocket costs. Anthony Albanese has promised Labor will “always be better” on health, signalling higher levels of funding, but is yet to announce its full policy. Coalition voters still approved of the Morrison government’s handling of hospitals, with 29% saying it made them more likely to support the government and 19% less likely. But the issue is biting among voters aged 55 and over, 19% more of who said they’d be less likely to vote Coalition, and non-major party voters, 37% more of who said they’d be less likely to vote Coalition. The AMA’s Clear the Hospital Logjam campaign argues that the public hospital system was struggling before Covid-19, but now faces blowouts in ambulances ramping, emergency departments at capacity, and long waits for essential surgery. The AMA president, Dr Omar Khorshid, said the results “put the political parties on notice that public hospital funding is resonating as a vote-changer with the Australian electorate”. “The distressing picture we are getting of our hospital funding crisis should be a warning shot to all politicians that they need to pledge they’ll fix public hospital funding if elected,” he said. In October the Morrison government dismissed calls for more hospital funding as a form of “shakedown politics”, targeting the Queensland premier in particular despite the bipartisan call from Labor and Liberal premiers. The Queensland health minister, Yvette D’Ath, told Guardian Australia “Queensland’s position is unchanged – we’re calling for long-term sustainable health funding from the commonwealth”. In addition to 50-50 funding, it wants “an extension of the current financial arrangements in the fight against Covid because the challenge the pandemic poses to Queensland is ongoing”, she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The Morrison government needs to start taking its health responsibilities far more seriously. “This includes providing aged care packages to the more than 500 Queenslanders who are currently in Queensland public hospital beds.” The Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, said the health system “is under extreme pressure and the current funding arrangement with the commonwealth, where the states pay more, is unfair and unsustainable”. “The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on everything from primary health care in the community to our hospitals will mean states will be carrying the impact of this one-in-100-year event for many years to come.” The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, has again rejected calls for more funding, citing the federal contribution to health growing by 92% between 2012-13 and 2020-21, compared with state increases of 44%. “There is nothing stopping the states and territories matching the Australian government investment in public hospitals, and if they did, hospitals would be adequately funded,” a spokesperson for Hunt said.

2/22/2022,"Asda is facing potential disruption to supermarket deliveries after thousands of lorry drivers, warehouse staff and clerical workers voted to reject a pay offer. Almost 70% of the GMB union’s 8,000 members within Asda’s distribution network, which employs 12,000 in total, voted to reject pay rises of between 5% and 7.5%.  That pay rise compares to inflation of 7.8% – on the retail price index measure – while the legal minimum wage is set to increase by 6.6% in April. The government’s preferred measure of inflation – the consumer prices index – is expected to rise from 5.5% in January to almost 8% in April. Almost 80% of those balloted said they were ready to take action over the pay deal, raising the prospect of strikes that would affect all 23 distribution depots serving the UK’s third largest supermarket chain.

Inflation is rampant and energy prices are out of control. “Yet Asda workers are being taken for mugs with a below-inflation pay offer that basically means a real-terms pay cut. “They’re not going to take it lying down – it’s now up to Asda bosses to come back with a reasonable offer and avert the threat of industrial action.” Jon Parry, the vice-president of Asda Logistics Services, said: “We value the key role our colleagues play to keep our stores well stocked, and we have negotiated in good faith with the GMB to make a fair, competitive and sustainable pay offer that recognises rising inflation. We are disappointed this has been rejected.” Asda said it expected the GMB to honour a national recognition agreement under which the next step would be a meeting between the union, the supermarket and the conciliation service Acas. Asda is the latest major business to face potential industrial action over pay as shortages of workers, particularly those qualified to drive large lorries, empowers those in relatively low-paid work. The supermarket was forced join rivals in offering signing-on fees of as much as £1,000 last year as a combination of the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit reduced access to suitable staff. The average hourly rate for Asda distribution workers is currently £15.07 for a driver and £13.09 for a warehouse worker. Before Christmas, Tesco avoided threatened strike action by the Usdaw and Unite unions, which would have affected about 13 of its 22 distribution centres, after offering an improved pay deal. Drivers were offered a 5.5% rise backdated to July and a further 0.5% from the end of February this year. Drivers at the courier group Yodel, which works with some of the UK’s biggest retailers, including Marks & Spencer and Aldi, also won a pay rise to £16 an hour after a threat of strike action by GMB members. A further strike by Unite members at Tesco’s Booker wholesale business planned before Christmas was suspended pending a pay review. It is understood talks are continuing.",News/Business,Thousands of Asda lorry drivers ready to strike after rejecting pay deal,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/21/thousands-of-asda-lorry-drivers-ready-to-strike-after-rejecting-pay-deal
2/22/2022,"A former Post Office worker has recounted how she pleaded guilty on the day of her daughter’s birthday, while another was sentenced as her granddaughter was born, in a day of harrowing testimony of victims wrongly prosecuted for stealing in the Horizon IT scandal. Siobhan Sayer, 54, told a public inquiry on Monday that she was barred from seeing her distressed six-month-old daughter as investigators visited her home in 2008 seeking £18,000 in funds missing from her Post Office business.  “They came in, asked if they could search the property and I said I had no issue as I had nothing to hide,” she said. “They went through kitchen draws, the filing cabinet [and] tipped my underwear drawer upside down while joking about where I hid the money, saying it would be much easier if I told them where it was. I was humiliated, terrified. I had a six-month-old daughter. I wasn’t allowed to see her. She started crying and I wasn’t allowed to leave to go and see her. That ended me. I had to end the interview as I couldn’t continue any longer.” Sayer said that during the lengthy investigation she felt “generally harassed and intimidated”, including regularly finding someone parked outside her house. Ultimately, on the advice of lawyers, she pleaded guilty to charges of false accounting in 2010 – on the day of her daughter’s birthday. “I went to court that morning thinking I wouldn’t be coming home,” said the mother-of-four. “Thinking it would be left to Dad to discuss [my incarceration] with them. I was advised I would receive a custodial sentence. I went to court that day with a case packed not knowing if I would be coming home.” Pauline Thompson, 72, also recalled being told by lawyers to “pack a bag” on the day the judge handed down her sentence, although she too ultimately avoided jail. She had already endured being arrested in the heart of her village, being held in a cell and having her DNA and fingerprints taken. “I had to sell the local newspaper [in the Post Office] with my face all over the front page,” she said. “The day I was sentenced my daughter gave birth to my granddaughter. The judge was very kind, he realised I was in a dark place and finished by saying ‘go and enjoy your first grandchild’. I felt that was taken away from me as I couldn’t enjoy her pregnancy. My lawyer had told me to pack a bag. I felt quite ill. Pack a bag, what do you pack?” In a day of emotional hearings, victims recounted similar stories of the huge toll on more than 700 Post Office operators wrongly prosecuted for theft and false accounting between 2000 and 2014 due to a flawed IT system suggesting financial shortfalls. “I got tarred overnight,” said Timothy Burgess, who remembers noticing shortfalls the very first day the IT system was installed. “People ignored me, crossed the street. People were hostile. I killed the village, I had that levelled at me.” Burgess’s relationship with his daughter “deteriorated quite a bit” and even a shift to a new school 30 miles away “was not far enough” to avoid the scandal. An attempt by his sister-in-law to buy the village pet store, something she “had her heart set on”, was thwarted by the owner because of the association with Burgess.

It was terrible to tell a young child.” While ultimately Adedayo did not go to jail – the judge took into consideration her young family and that she had started to pay the Post Office back – the years of being considered guilty wreaked an enormous emotional and financial cost. “All of a sudden I was a thief: they wrote it on the wall,” she said. “I wanted to die, I really did. I would go shopping at night, [my children] missed out on socialising as well. If anyone invited them to, say, a birthday party I would make excuses to say no because I couldn’t face anyone. I couldn’t go to the school gates to meet them because I was ashamed. Everything I ever worked for went down the pan overnight.

2/22/2022,"Vladimir Putin has said he is considering recognising the Russian-controlled territories in southeast Ukraine as independent states in what would be a pivotal decision, scuttling an existing peace agreement and possibly triggering tough new sanctions from the west. In an extraordinary meeting of his security council broadcast on national television, the Russian president said he would make a decision later on Monday following a choreographed back-and-forth with his top advisers designed to prepare public support for the decision.  Later, state TV channel Rossiya-24 said Putin would deliver a video address to the nation on TV on Monday evening. “We’ve been negotiating for eight years,” Putin told his aides at one point during the security council meeting. “We’re at a dead end.” In turn, each of Putin’s top advisers stood at a lectern and delivered a speech that ended in favour of recognition of the separatist states in Ukraine’s Luhansk and Donetsk regions, which have been at war with Kyiv since 2014. The two territories are run by separatist governments widely seen as Russian proxy states inside Ukraine. Since 2014, they have been in conflict with Kyiv, which refers to them as “temporarily occupied territories”, similar to Crimea. They have received military and financial backing from Moscow since they declared their existence after the Ukrainian revolution in 2014. The two regions cover an area of about 6,500 sq miles and were primarily known before the war for their heavy industry and coal mining. Donetsk, the largest city, previously had an international airport and hosted matches during the Uefa Euro 2012 championship. The fighting has destroyed the airport and left the territories mostly cut off from the rest of Ukraine in a dire economic state. The borders with Russia remain open. What are their relationship to Moscow? Officially, Moscow sees the two states as part of Ukraine and has not recognised their independence, but it has dealings with the leaderships of the self-declared states. Unofficially, the two regions are seen as fully controlled by Moscow. Who are the people there? Leaked documents suggest there are just under 3 million people remaining in the territories, 38% of whom are pensioners. That’s less than half of the pre-war population. Public opposition in the territories is virtually non-existent. It has become extremely difficult for independent journalists to go to the region. How many troops are there? It is not clear how large a force is present in the two territories. Ukraine has claimed that there are “35,000 military personnel and 481 battle tanks, 914 armoured combat vehicles, 720 artillery systems, 202 multiple launch rocket systems on the uncontrolled territories of Donbass”. According to Rochan Consulting, however, those numbers could be “overestimated”. It ended in a made-for-TV cliffhanger. “I have heard your opinion – a decision will be made today,” Putin said. The broadcast then quickly cut to a news anchor. Putin has instructed his subordinates to “maintain tensions” with the west as he seeks “security guarantees” that would effectively reconstitute a Russian sphere of influence in eastern Europe. To that end, Russia has amassed more than 150,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders, threatening a massive invasion that could target Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine, according to western officials. The threat of official recognition for its two proxy states in Donetsk and Luhansk has also been a part of that pressure campaign. Russia has controlled and armed the two states since the outbreak of fighting in southeast Ukraine following a revolution in Kyiv in 2014, but wanted to keep them in Ukraine with the right to veto crucial decisions, such as membership of Nato. Ukraine has said it will contest any decision by Russia to recognise the territories’ independence and would recognise the move as a Russian decision to exit the Minsk agreements, the peace deal signed in 2015 that now appears close to collapse. After Putin’s speech, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, said he had called for United Nations Security Council states to hold consultations under the Budapest memorandum to “discuss urgent actions aimed at de-escalation, as well as practical steps to guarantee the security of Ukraine.” Putin may still choose not to recognise the two states’ independence, using the staged debate with his advisers to show western leaders that they are running out of time to negotiate. But it appears more likely he will follow the unanimous advice of his aides and close allies to recognise the two territories in a dangerous shift of the status quo. The decision could either freeze the conflict in southeast Ukraine or reignite it, depending on the Ukrainian response and whether Putin seeks to take further territory. The move surprised some analysts, who said that they believed that recognising the states as independent could relieve Putin of some of his leverage over Ukraine. “This is not where I thought we end up. I still do not see at all what is to be gained from the recognition of the Donbas,” said Sam Greene, director of the Russia Institute at King’s College London. “The breakaway regions were more useful for Putin formally as part of Ukraine than outside Ukraine.” But Putin may be searching for a win in his high-stakes confrontation with the west, in which he has sought to convince Joe Biden and other western leaders to pressure Ukraine into conceding to Russia’s demands or face a potentially devastating war. In their public discussion on Monday, Putin and his advisers made a show of airing their frustrations with Ukraine’s leadership. “If we speak about the situation that has unfolded around the [Donetsk People’s Republic] and [Luhansk People’s Republic], then it’s entirely clear that Ukraine in principle does not have use for these territories,” said Dmitri Medvedev, the former president of Russia, as he cast his vote for the proposition. Dmitry Kozak, the Kremlin lead on talks with Ukraine, said the west was trying to “purposefully stall” in its negotiations with Russia and that no negotiated settlement was possible. By assembling his top advisers, Putin was also making a case for himself to approve the recognition of two territories that do not hold the same kind of appeal or cultural significance as Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. Donetsk and Luhansk are both known for their coal mining and heavy industry and have become severely economically depressed since the outbreak of the war in 2014. At moments the meeting resembled a reality TV show as Putin’s advisers each took their turn making their case. Putin claimed that he hadn’t warned them of the meeting ahead of time, although that was difficult to believe. Monday’s decision was preceded by a series of incidents on the border that indicated the Kremlin was creating a case to recognise its proxy territories in southeastern Ukraine. The Russian-backed leaders last week announced a formal evacuation of the two territories, citing the rise in artillery fire and claiming that Ukraine was planning to launch a large-scale assault. And on Monday, Russia claimed its soldiers had killed five “saboteurs” who crossed the border from Ukraine into the Rostov region, as fears intensified that the Kremlin was creating a case to mount an invasion of Ukraine. No evidence was presented to support the claim, which was dismissed by Kyiv as the latest in a series of fake statements by Moscow. Russia’s Southern Military District said a Federal Security Service border patrol had identified a sabotage and reconnaissance group that had breached the border near the village of Mityakinskaya in the early hours of Monday morning. The border patrol allegedly called in troops for backup and in the ensuing clash five Ukrainians were killed, the SMD said. Ukraine dismissed the account as false information. “Another fake. We don’t have people there, nor could they be [there],” Ukraine’s military said. Russian officials earlier also said that a Ukrainian shell had destroyed a border facility used by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB).

2/22/2022,"A 24-year-old English teacher developed a chronic gambling addiction that started with betting small amounts on controversial fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) when he was in the sixth form, an inquest into his death has heard. Jack Ritchie, a Hull university history graduate, took his own life while teaching English in Hanoi, Vietnam, in November 2017.  His parents, Charles and Liz Ritchie, from Sheffield, argue that government failures contributed to their son’s death in that he was hooked on “products licensed by the state”. The inquest examining Ritchie’s death is believed by his parents to be the first so-called article 2 inquest in a case relating to suicide after gambling. That means its scope will include an examination of whether any arm of the state breached its duty to protect their son’s right to life. On Monday, the opening day, a witness statement from Ritchie’s childhood friend Nick Clough was read. He described going with Ritchie to betting shops when they were aged 16 or 17 and spending small amounts on the machines. Ritchie’s intention was to double his money “to get a free lunch”. But he added: “With Jack it became more than that.” A trigger moment was when Ritchie won £1,000 in less than 30 seconds, a win that changed his attitude to gambling as he began chasing his losses and looking for the big win. Other witness evidence read to the inquest described how no one had realised the extent of Ritchie’s problems until he had taken his own life. Forensic evidence presented to the inquest showed he was a regular visitor to the BetVictor online gambling website in the days leading up to his death. The inquest at Sheffield town hall opened with a video montage of happy moments from Ritchie’s life. His father described him as a “fine young man on the threshold of his life” who “brightened the lives of everyone around him”. Charles and Liz Ritchie have campaigned for reform of gambling legislation through a charity, Gambling With Lives, that they helped set up. The couple believe an undiagnosed gambling disorder lay behind their son’s death and argue there were no public health warnings about the risk to life posed by gambling products. Their son was not diagnosed or offered treatment that linked his symptoms to gambling disorder, they say. The coroner David Urpeth said the evidence at the hearing, expected to last two weeks, would cover topics including what information was available to Ritchie and his family about the risks of gambling and also what medical treatment was available to him. Urpeth said that his examination of how Ritchie died would include “whether gambling caused or contributed to his death”. The coroner said he understood that the family wanted the scope of the inquest to be an even wider analysis of government gambling policy and told them: “I do not want the family to think I am disinterested in their wider concerns. It’s just that such concerns are beyond the power invested in me.” Officials from the Gambling Commission and the Department of Health and Social Care and Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport are among those expected to give evidence at the inquest. Charles Ritchie previously told the Guardian that he had discovered his son’s addiction when he was 18. He promptly took him into every betting shop in Sheffield, where Jack Ritchie left a photograph and signed a form that would exclude him from placing bets there. But his addiction simply transferred online. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

2/22/2022,"Eleven villagers were enough to bring down a giant, so it goes. On the day the 1958 World Cup final was played in Solna, another game took place 2,200 miles south, which wasn’t where they wanted it but that made it better in the end.  Athletic Club de Bilbao – Atlético then, by dictatorial decree – had requested the final of the Copa del Generalísimo be held in a neutral city, but the Generalísimo wasn’t going anywhere which meant that nor were they. At best, they were told, Spain’s showpiece game could be moved to the Metropolitano so they said let’s stick to the Santiago Bernabéu. That way, more of their fans would get in to see them win it. Which was pretty bold, a bilbainada – a song and a mindset, a declaration of invincibility all the better if it’s against the odds. They followed through on it. In front of 125,000, it finished 2-0 against that Real Madrid in their own home, a month after Paco Gento’s goal had given them the third of five consecutive European Cups. Once aldeanos – 11 villagers, an entire lineup of locals – had done over the world’s side, Athletic’s president Enrique Guzmán declared, the name of a team and the identity of a club expressed in a line that lasted. On Sunday night, footage from the 1958 final was broadcast on the screens at San Mamés before the Basque derby against Real Sociedad, in honour of Mauricio Ugartemendia Lauzirika. Born in Gernika, an Athletic midfielder for 11 years, making 295 appearances and getting 72 goals, scorer of the second in that final that would define them, the man who ran Bar Poxpolin after he retired, “Mauri” had passed away two days earlier, aged 87. The club’s anthem was played on the piano accompanied by silence from the stands, the teams lined up wearing black bands. And then, when it finished, Athletic’s players paid him tribute by beating Real Sociedad 4-0 despite missing a penalty. Athletic hadn’t scored four against la Real in 45 years – and the last time they had won a derby by four goals, Mauri was still playing. Legend has it that when the captain Piru Gaínza collected the cup in 1958 he turned to Franco and said: “See you next year.” Actually, he didn’t, but the Once Aldeanos – Carmelo, Orúe, Garay, Canito, Mauri, Etura, Artetxe, Uribe, Arieta, Aguirre, Gaínza – were some team: league winners in 1956, cup winners in 1955 and 56, they defeated Honved and beat the Busby Babes 5-3 in 1957 (although, down to 10 men, they lost the second leg at Old Trafford), before winning that final against Di Stéfano’s European champions. The following season, Mauri scored a hat-trick against Celta during a run in which Athletic won 9-0, 9-0, 8-1 and 7-0 in a row. The year after, they scored six against Oviedo, five against Atlético, four against Barcelona. And beat Real Sociedad 4-0 at San Mamés. Dani Vivian heads in the opener in the Basque Derby! 🔥San Mames erupts as Athletic Club take the lead 🦁 pic.twitter.com/6bQNWq1cYv Times have changed, though, and it didn’t happen again. It didn’t look much like it was going to happen this time, either. “Strip away all the paraphernalia that surrounds a derby and what you’re left with is an unsmokeable chestnut,” claimed El Correo Vasco. Rubbish, in other words. That was only a half-truth: the paraphernalia is part of the point, maybe even the whole point. Football without feeling is worthless and there may be no game anywhere with the depth of identity that this derby has, the culture, the pull of history and the connection to its community on both sides. There’s no meeting more local and there certainly isn’t anywhere you would see blue and white shirts spread around red and white stands even on a night when no away tickets have officially been sold. The games are often fun, with something enjoyable in the different styles within a context where much is shared. This wasn’t bad either, yet there was something in that comment, certainly in the first half. There wasn’t much football and, although Raúl García managed to get a yellow card after four minutes, there weren’t even that many fouls: nine each in the 90 minutes. There was not much blood, not much thunder, and in the first 45 minutes there weren’t any goals. Not least because Álex Remiro, the former Athletic goalkeeper who was whistled and chanted at throughout, whose mistake cost la Real the last derby, saved an Iker Muniain penalty, earning temporary revenge and two kilos of beef from a local radio station. But, the Athletic coach Marcelino García Toral insisted, the fact that Athletic didn’t disappear from the game after that, that they “never got demoralised”, was “supremely important”. And then suddenly, midway through the second half, it exploded. The Athletic striker Iñaki Williams talked afterwards about how he loved and had missed that feeling that “every corner is a goal [and] teams fear us”. The sporting director, Rafael Alkorta, conjured up the combination of expectation and excellent delivery, big men with granite foreheads waiting for the ball, referring to corners as “half a goal”, and if that wasn’t quite right either it wasn’t so far off. They’re better than penalties, anyway. Athletic have scored two of seven spot kicks, Muniain becoming the third player to miss; on Sunday night, by contrast, from corners they scored two from six. And then, liberated, launched into their opponents. Dani Vivian headed in the first corner on 68 minutes. Less than four minutes later Oihan Sancet volleyed in the second. He had only been on the pitch 10 minutes but he changed the game completely, scoring the second, leading the move for a superb third, finished by Williams, and assisting Muniain’s fourth. It all happened so fast that la Real didn’t have time to work out what was going on, and nor did anyone else. They had played in Europe on Thursday night, arriving back on Friday, and although the midfielder Martín Zubimendi insisted “that’s no excuse: we can’t let ourselves go after letting in one goal”, their physical condition probably played a part. Athletic’s certainly did: no team produce as many high-intensity runs, flying around the field. Williams was unstoppable, right side and left, every surge in step with the stands, like they were the ones pressing the accelerator. “It’s easier when you go hand in hand with the fans,” he said. Suddenly, they were coming from everywhere. In 19 minutes, Athletic scored four, the noise rolling round. By the final minute, the olés were too. “A perfect night,” the Correo Vasco called it. “A merciless destruction,” AS said. “What a tearing apart,” Marca declared. The Real Sociedad coach Imanol Alguacil said: “I’m the one to blame and that’s it, full stop.” Marcelino beamed: “I’m proud of my players for letting me experience the joy of another magical night at San Mamés.” Elche 2-1 Rayo VallecanoReal Madrid 3-0 AlavésCádiz 1-1 GetafeOsasuna 0-3 Atlético MadridGranada 1-4 VillarrealAthletic Bilbao 4-0 Real SociedadReal Betis 2-1 Real MallorcaValencia 1-4 BarcelonaEspanyol 1-1 Sevilla Another was the word. There’s something childlike, almost sweetly disbelieving about Marcelino’s smile, there again on Sunday night, and it has been seen a lot lately: in the past month alone, Athletic have beaten Madrid, Atlético and Barcelona and have now scored four against Real Sociedad, their first derby win in five taking them to within a point of their rivals and just two from a European place. Level at 1-1, they also have the second leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final to come, having knocked out Barcelona and Madrid. The last time Athletic scored four against Real Sociedad, in 1977 in a 4-2 win, it was two months and one day before they played a cup final against Betis. Sunday night was two months and three days before another cup final. They meet Valencia in one semi-final; Betis lead Rayo in the other. If Athletic get through, that would be three consecutive finals, plus two Super Cup finals, one of which they won against Lionel Messi’s Barcelona having beaten Madrid to get there. Marcelino meanwhile is 90 minutes away from reaching his fourth in a row, having won it with Valencia before joining Athletic (where his first was inherited from Gaizka Garitano). Omens have a habit of ending up empty, they will never get back that fortnight when they lost cup finals against Real Sociedad and Barcelona, and there’s a hint of desperation, a need to take this one last step, but to have got this far is an achievement, like something from another time. And, as Marcelino insisted, “it’s not chance”. This may not be Once Aldeanos exactly, but it doesn’t get much closer these days: every player in the Athletic squad was born less than 100 miles from San Mamés, where they turned Sunday night’s derby into a homage to Mauricio Ugartemendia Lauzirika and all those men who came before them.",Sport/Football,Athletic Bilbao summon spirit of Once Aldeanos in Basque derby triumph,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/21/athletic-bilbao-summon-spirit-of-once-aldeanos-in-basque-derby-triumph
2/22/2022,"Boris Johnson’s use of apocalyptic demons to aid his survival in office knows no limit. Since his near-death experience of “partygate”, he has shamelessly exploited war, floods and pestilence. All have responded. Pestilence is now his greatest ally. The decision announced today to end all remaining pandemic restriction measures in England goes flatly against his more cautious advisers and appears highly political. That does not make it wrong. The prime duty of government is to protect people from death and disease. After two years of Covid, the most basic measure of that protection is the “excess death rate” from all causes. In England this is now negative, that is, running below the seasonal norm, while Covid-related hospitalisations across the entire UK are falling fast. The crisis is over. Were Covid not in the air, mass testing for, say, infectious flu would seem an excessive precaution, given the government’s claims that it costs an astronomical £2bn a month. Whether this continues apparently remains a matter of argument.  It is true that excess deaths also fell a year ago before the return of Covid via the Omicron variant, a return not remotely as serious as previous variants. It was countered by the clearly effective remedy of vaccination. Nonetheless, the return was enough for “the science” to challenge Johnson’s decision to end quarantine requirements and scale back mass testing. He is determined to “return to normal” after two years of national disruption, leaving individuals and organisations to make their own judgments on caution, as with other diseases. Yes, he says, it is a risk, but his job is to judge risks, and sometimes to take them. In this case Johnson is surely right. Leaving aside vaccination – unquestioned hero of the hour – the external cost of the Covid lockdown has been unquantifiable but appalling. In medicine alone, cancers have gone unreported, with other illnesses untreated and mental health neglected. The money spent on lockdown compensation, much of it reckless and some even corrupt, has been denied to other welfare uses. The cost to child welfare is inestimable, as has been the cost to education. It is, of course, possible that ending mandatory self-isolation may lead to another upturn, though whether this should justify a return of lockdown must be doubted. Support for the clinically vulnerable should remain, and be shored up with new resources. More to the point is that the government – and the country – should now be able to turn its resources and attention to recovering from Covid’s wider damage to the nation’s welfare caused over the past two years. It is worrying how rarely those pleading for continued lockdown refer to this damage. It is as if because a cost is unquantifiable in the short term it does not exist. Too often scientists sound like just another interest group out to protect its reputation and budget. As Neil Ferguson’s Imperial College London modelling group were quoted as admitting: “We do not consider the wider social and economic costs of suppression.” It is why Sweden’s decision to avoid a draconian lockdown merits serious analysis. Its GDP fell by 2.9%, Britain’s by 9.4%. In the European league tables Sweden falls around the middle in deaths per capita, still well below Britain. Experts should be on tap, not on top. They should be listened to but not obeyed. We vote for politicians to rule us and no one else, thank goodness. Now Johnson can get back to his other demons, still dancing attendance at his door.

2/22/2022,"In 2006, the first uploads appeared on Jamal Edwards’ YouTube channel SBTV. On grainy footage, young MCs dart in and out of the camera, spraying bars into the lens, old school grime instrumentals playing on loop in the background. These rough cuts were a symbol of what was to come for a man and a generation of MCs emerging out of working-class corners of the UK. At a time when genres such as grime and rap had been barred from the stages of British mainstream music, and were largely absent from charts and radio, award shows and TV, Edwards and SBTV became a refuge and a haven for young MCs seeking an outlet. Edwards was a conductor and a vessel, embodying the culture’s DIY essence, and allowing adolescent expression to find voice on the newly levelled terrain of YouTube.  The channel raised generations of musicians. Known as Smokey Barz back then, it launched soon after YouTube itself. What started as Edwards filming local friends with double lives as MCs became a hub and a meeting point for an entire scene. In the first 10 years of its life, the channel ran music videos, interviews and behind-the-scenes footage. But its showcase pieces were its freestyle sessions, the most popular of which were F64 and Warm Up Sessions. Over the years, the sound’s most popular and most cherished artists have graced those sessions: from respected veterans such as Boy Better Know and Akala, Margs and Black the Ripper, NoLay and Skinnyman, then staggering down the generations, featuring rising stars Dave and J Hus in 2015, and a standout Warm Up Session from Big Zuu in 2016. When it came to the freestyles, Jamal was deep in the weeds – even once the channel had grown to over a million subscribers, and he had helped launch the careers of mammoth pop stars such as Ed Sheeran, Jessie J and Jess Glynne, and he had been given an MBE for services to music in 2014. Many MCs and musicians such as the late MC Cadet recount stories of how he would tell them to rewrite their lyrics, pushing them to go deeper, asking them to bring who they are, the conditions that shaped them, on to their records. The result is vital collection of British music. The channel, still running, is a time capsule and a snapshot of contemporary sound in Britain. Through its videos you can trace the evolution of music in Black Britain, grime moving into UK rap, then both bleeding into Afroswing and UK drill. Its essence and meaning to the community from which it sprang is best captured in a Warm Up Session by Birmingham grime pioneer Vader, who raps: “Big up Jamal, best wishes … keep showing the world the best of the British.” But the legacy of Edwards is not consigned to artists and MCs alone. There are generations of creatives who have passed through the revolving doors of his company. I worked at SBTV for about 15 months, stretching from 2016 to 2018, working across editorial and YouTube, searching for my break in a media industry that seemed sealed at the doors. In SBTV I found a space to deepen my craft. I found encouragement, connections and deep friendships that carry on to this day. In that experience I was not alone. There are a string of creatives and photographers, media personalities and directors, who Edwards has given a leg up. “That to me is the most important thing,” he said in an interview, “because that’s what I got into it for, being able to help get these artists get to the next level.” When Jay-Z was seeking to get in touch with talented rapper turned director Rapman, it was Edwards who linked the two. The result was Rapman signing to Roc Nation, and the eventual release of his successful cult film Blue Story. Many across the country have similar stories to tell. Sitting in the office, you would often hear stories of young creatives seeking Edwards out for advice, photographers who had stopped him on the street, asked for an opportunity to work and within a few weeks were shooting and creating content for brands and the SBTV Instagram. He was a dreamer who reached out and grabbed his future. And when he found success, he encouraged and inspired a wave of watching kids to do the same. “Everyone has the potential in them,” he once said in an interview with Ross Kemp, “it’s just at what point in your life you unlock it.” In the hours since he died aged 31, social media has been awash with stories of his generosity from music executives and media personalities, producers and writers who he laid out a bridge for, a connection between his community and industries that had long resisted them. This work to uplift and encourage goes beyond music. In recent years Edwards had launched JE Delve, a youth charity in Ealing, London, dedicated to giving young people the opportunity to develop skills in fields from film-making to architecture, continuing his devotion to nurturing talent emerging out of the edges. The same boy who picked up a camera and changed the fortunes of himself and hundreds of others more than decade back retained the same focus and intent as a grown man. In a year where rap and Black music in Britain continues to scale new heights, now with its own official category at the Brits, producing some of the highest-selling artists in the country, Jamal Edwards’ contribution cannot be understated or forgotten. He was a pioneer who laid the ground for those who came after, carved a door out of the ether and beckoned his people, his community, his friends and even strangers to walk through it.",Arts/Music,Jamal Edwards: a pioneer of British music whose generosity paved the way for generations,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/21/jamal-edwards-a-pioneer-of-british-music-whose-generosity-paved-the-way-for-generations
