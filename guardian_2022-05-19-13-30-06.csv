5/19/2022,"The Avalanches are all about waiting. It was not long after the squashing of the Y2K bug that they released Since I Left You, that sprawling cavalcade of an album that ruled every house party in the 2000s. It was entirely its own: part danceable dreamscape, part electric luau, something new stitched together from the past, using samples old enough to prompt nostalgia and obscure enough to stoke amusement. Since I Left You was a rare critical and commercial hit, and a record that stood up to closer scrutiny and repeated listening. You could flog it on rotation without killing its appeal. There was no filler in a cohesive vision. People wondered what a second album would bring, then waited 16 years for it. In the interim, band members dropped away. Various configurations of the Avalanches did play live, but not often. They were the most elusive of big-name bands. So it tallied that a date with the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra involved waiting too. The idea came via the Illuminate Adelaide festival: to mark the 20th anniversary of Since I Left You, the Avalanches would perform the full album with the orchestra. First listed for July 2021, the show had one Covid postponement, then another. Finally, on Wednesday, it happened, with Tony di Blasi and Robbie Chater taking to the Adelaide Entertainment Centre stage in sparkly jackets, working synthesisers and samplers in the midst of the string section. The combination worked. For all its technical prowess, Since I Left You first gets a hold on people through melody and vocals. The melodies on the title track and its companion Stay Another Season, or the adventure of Electricity, gained a new richness, the flutes enjoying some rare time in the spotlight. The harp had its moment during Little Journey. More discordant offerings like Flight Tonight tested the musicians’ adaptability, while Radio delivered full-venue oomf, with tuba and bass thumping the beat like an elephant footfall.The most orchestra-friendly, unsurprisingly, was Frontier Psychiatrist, the bombast of its spaghetti western musicality coming to life as the brass section came in with a vengeance. This song is a composer’s holy grail: simultaneously a technical standout, a social critique, a piece of wild comedy, and a stone-cold banger. Decades on, it still has a huge sound, and its assembly of spoken samples is just as clever. “I promised my girlfriend I could play the violin” is even better when backed by a whole section of violinists. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning All parts of the orchestra were involved, rather than relying on strings. There were technical challenges: electronic beats have a fast attack, meaning the sound peaks with a speed that orchestral instruments don’t match. There were points when the timing between human and machine slipped. But also, no one cared. They had come to hear a certain record, and they were hearing it. The orchestra players were visibly enjoying themselves. The Avalanches were enjoying themselves. The conductor was having a ball. The sense of fun was pervasive. The only disappointment was that the venue wasn’t set up with standing room for general admission: tightly packed seats meant that only a few pockets of people in aisles could get up and dance to a show that deserved far more. Some music demands movement. Since I Left You, though, has always allowed for contemplation as well. As the orchestra closed out with gentling renditions of Live at Dominoes and Extra Kings, the atmosphere wound down into a sensation you could melt into, a feeling of floating free. In the era that delayed this show so many times, feelings like that are precious. There may be something else to take from the Avalanches’ own trajectory: looking back to a standalone masterpiece, appreciating it in its own right, with no rush towards any subsequent mediocrity. If time moves, then waiting can take you somewhere. All of that has become part of the Avalanches’ story, and 22 years later, it’s a story still being told.

5/19/2022,"Australia’s largest bank has paused the launch of cryptocurrency trading through its app amid turmoil and uncertainty in the market. Commonwealth Bank announced in November plans to allow its customers to buy and sell cryptocurrency through its app. Under the plan, customers would be able to buy up to 10 crypto assets including bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. The bank had planned an initial pilot, before “progressively [rolling out] more features to more customers in 2022”. However, Guardian Australia has confirmed the rollout is paused, with no time set on when it will resume. Those who were on the initial pilot have not been able to continue trading crypto through the app. The chief executive of the Commonwealth Bank, Matt Comyn, said the company was working on the feedback received from customers, but indicated more regulation would be needed before advancing to the next stage “As events of the last week have reinforced, it is clearly a very volatile sector that remains an enormous amount of interest. But alongside that volatility and awareness and I guess the scale, certainly globally, you can see there is a lot of interest from regulators and people thinking about the best way to regulate that,” he said in a tech briefing this week. The federal Treasury is consulting on regulation around cryptocurrency, with submissions open until 27 May. Comyn indicated the government formed after the election would be focused on “how to most appropriately regulate the sector”. “We want to continue to play a leading role in providing input into that and shaping the most appropriate regulatory outcome,” he said. “Our intention still, at this stage is to restart the pilot, but there is still a couple of things that we want to work through on a regulatory front to make sure that that is most appropriate.” It is a tumultuous time for cryptocurrency. Stablecoin Terra collapsed this month, causing an effective crypto crash that wiped between 15% and 25% off the value of most major cryptocurrencies. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Dr Dimitrios Salampasis, a lecturer in fintech leadership and entrepreneurship at Swinburne University, said large incumbents such as CBA were scared about the potential reputational damage from association with crypto. He said it was about balancing risk, and CBA would keep working on it in the background to retain first-mover advantage. “The cautionary tone is also a signal to investors, shareholders and ecosystem stakeholders, since the perceived inbound and outbound risk for CBA is probably higher after embarking on such a journey,” he said. “I do not believe that the project – at least for now – is stalled. But balancing risk, brand equity and regulatory clarity will be key so as to minimise disruption in CBA’s current business model.” The crypto crash may also throw into question a recent $25m deal between cryptocurrency exchange platform Crypto.com and the Australian Football League announced in January. Under the five-year deal, Crypto.com will have exclusive naming rights for the AFL Score Review during the premiership and final series matches. The AFL refused to comment on the deal, saying it doesn’t discuss commercial partnerships. A spokesperson for Crypto.com wouldn’t say whether the deal was paid in cash or cryptocurrency but said the company was still committed to the partnership. “Crypto.com remains fully committed to its sports sponsorships. We are well-financed, and these are multiyear contracts, which will continue to play a crucial role in our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to cryptocurrency.”",News/Australia news,Commonwealth Bank pauses in-app cryptocurrency trading after market turmoil,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/commonwealth-bank-pauses-in-app-cryptocurrency-trading-after-market-turmoil
5/19/2022,"Smoke curls into the air, a drum beats, the dance begins, a chant is raised. Ten metres away, cars howl past on a busy road, drivers unaware of the sacred ritual taking place in the centre of a bustling South African city. Francisco Mackenzie, a chief of the Cochoqua community of the Khoi people, talks of ancient beliefs and battles five centuries ago, against invaders from overseas. He points to the iconic skyline of Table Mountain, and then to a nearby building site. “This is where we come to venerate our ancestors and the great spirit creator and to renew our nation’s ties. That is where the first battle of resistance took place. But money is always disrespectful of nature, traditions and culture,” he told the Guardian. The money in question are the potential profits to be made from a 15-hectare (37-acre) site in Cape Town’s Observatory neighbourhood that is being turned into a complex that will house homes, shops, a hotel, conference centre and businesses. By far the most important tenant at the £200m project will be Amazon, which hopes to base its expanding operations in Africa there. For now cranes and bulldozers are still. Earlier this month, a court in Cape Town upheld a judgment in March which stopped work on the sprawling complex until further consultations had taken place with heritage groups representing some Indigenous communities. “It is another vindication,” said Tauriq Jenkins, an activist and member of the Goringhaicona Khoena council, as he watched the ceremony begin. “It will [help] dispel the lies and disinformation that have been generated against our claims. It’s a victory for the Sān and Khoi, our heritage and environment and for restorative justice.” But the story of the development is less clear than it might look, pitting different visions of South Africa’s future against one another and causing a bitter row within the communities of the Khoi and the Sān peoples, who were the earliest inhabitants of the country. Those opposed to the project say the site is a place of worship for both the Sān, who roamed as hunter-gatherers for tens of thousands of years, and the Khoi, who joined them as pastoralists more than 2,000 years ago. Both were forced off the land by invading Dutch with huge numbers dying of starvation, disease or enslaved. Campaigners say the construction site is at the confluence of two sacred rivers and on land seized by the Dutch East India Company, a powerful trading company run by wealthy merchants in the Netherlands and often seen as the first modern multinational, in 1657. They make the obvious comparison to the present day. “Back then they was the largest corporate entity on the planet, and they came and took this land … History is repeating itself,” Jenkins said. Others, however, including several established Khoi and Sān community organisations, do not see rapacious corporate raiders but a chance to attract much-needed foreign investment to South Africa and to focus attention on the grievances of a historically marginalised minority in the country. A coalition of Indigenous groups calling itself the Western Cape First Nations Collective has backed the project and engaged with the developers who have promised to include a “world class” heritage centre in the development, staffed and run by educators from the Khoi and Sān, which will celebrate their culture. Zenzele Khoisan, the chairman of the collective, said the project offered “hope and future” to marginalised communities and dismissed critics as “johnny-come-latelies”. “The confluence of the rivers and the battlefield are not where the development is being built. We have got something now that the South African government has never given us … This will be the launchpad for new and more intense battles,” Khoisan said. He dismissed the claim that it would destroy important sites as “poppycock”. South Africa’s flagging economy has been battered by Covid, corruption, power shortages and the failure of the ruling African National Congress to push through reforms. Unemployment reached a record 35.3% last year, and almost two-thirds of young people lack jobs. Local authorities backed the development, arguing that it would regenerate a swath of Cape Town. The site area was previously home to a golf driving range and bar, built over an infill site for industrial and railway refuse, next to the confluence of the two now heavily polluted, canalised rivers. James Tannenberger, a spokesperson for the developers, said the recent court judgment would deprive the broader community around the site of “significant socio-economic and environmental benefits” such as subsidised housing, upgrades to roads, parks and gardens as well as up to 19,000 jobs. Land, its history and its ownership are fraught issues in South Africa, where memories of forced removals and segregation remain fresh nearly three decades after the end of apartheid. Ciraj Rassool, a history professor at the University of Western Cape, said South Africa’s existing protection of sites was flawed as it framed heritage as something to be opposed to development. “The current legislation can’t really deal with an argument about history. There is a bias towards architecture and artefacts but here you have the meaning of a landscape,” Rassool said. Judge Patricia Goliath said her ruling should not be understood as a criticism of the development but that the core issue was there needed to be proper consultation before it could go ahead. Amazon representatives in the UK and the US declined to comment. The company already employs thousands of people in data hubs in Cape Town. Jenkins and other campaigners are acutely aware that any victory could be temporary. “We’ve stopped this thing for now, but only for now,” he said.",News/World news,‘History repeating’: Amazon base in Cape Town splits Indigenous groups ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/history-repeating-amazon-base-in-cape-town-splits-indigenous-groups
5/19/2022,"New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern says she has lost her sense of taste after testing positive for Covid-19 on Saturday. Thursday was budget day in New Zealand, when traditionally the prime minister has an early morning breakfast with finance minister Grant Robertson. Typically, the two share cheese rolls – a South Island New Zealand delicacy involving cheddar cheese and powdered soup rolled inside a piece of toasted white bread. This year, the breakfast took place via Instagram live stream – and the prime minister said the cheese rolls were missing their usual flavour notes. “They’re going to taste just as good – but do you know what – I’m not going to know, because I’ve lost all my [sense of] taste,” Ardern said. The finance minister encouraged her to focus on texture rather than flavour. “Enjoy your cheese roll, think about the texture rather than the taste on this occasion,” Robertson said. Ardern remains in isolation and was absent in person from New Zealand’s budget announcement, the most important day of the political year. Speaking via video link to parliament, Ardern said: “My virtual presence in the debating chamber is obviously not to my preference on such a significant day.” This year’s budget included a $1bn set of temporary measures, including cash payments, reductions to petrol taxes and half-price public transport to ease the cost-of-living crisis. “No temporary fast relief can be perfect, but it can make a difference,” Ardern said. The big-ticket spending from Thursday’s budget included $11.1bn for healthcare reform and funding to address the climate crisis. When she announced she had contracted Covid-19, the prime minister said she was “gutted” to miss the day. “There are so many important things happening for the government this week … I’m gutted to miss being there in person, but will be staying in close touch with the team and sharing some reckons from here,” she said.",News/World news,"Jacinda Ardern loses sense of taste after Covid, can’t enjoy cheese roll",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/jacinda-ardern-loses-sense-of-taste-after-contracting-covid-and-cant-enjoy-cheese-roll
5/19/2022,"The novelty cheque has long been a mainstay of the political “photo op” but a Guardian Australia analysis of photos posted during the 2022 and 2019 election campaigns suggests giant cheques are on the way out, while hi-vis workwear and photos of dogs are on the rise. During our work building the automated systems behind the pork-o-meter, which tracks election campaign pork barrelling as it occurs, the Guardian’s data team found ourselves asking an important question. Could we teach a robot to spot photos of novelty cheques? We were already using machine learning to flag text from politicians’ Facebook posts as likely grant announcements and election promises, but having another model in place to find big cheques and certificates in photos might pick up things we’d missed in the text. Giant cheques have made news in previous years – in 2019 when the former Liberal candidate for Mayo, Georgina Downer, presented a grant to a bowling club despite this practice usually being the domain of the sitting MP. A novelty cheque again made headlines in 2020, when Senator Pauline Hanson announced a $23m grant for Rockhampton stadium. With this in mind, we trained an object recognition model to spot giant cheques. And from there it was a short step further to look at other common tropes of election campaign photo ops: hi-vis workwear and hardhats, cute dogs, and footballs. We chose these as they were either already available in pre-trained models such as Coco, or had publicly available image datasets for model training. Then we collated every photo posted by a major party candidate, MP or senator to Facebook in the 2022 and 2019 election periods using the Facebook API, and ran our object detection models on these images. So what did we find? First, some important caveats about our method. While many of the images do constitute pictures from photo ops, many photos are also just things politicians shared on their pages. For the prime ministerial candidates, the Facebook photo dataset also doesn’t include every photo op they’ve done on the campaign trail – we were able to cross-check this thanks to AAP’s comprehensive election coverage. So the dataset is not necessarily all the photos the politicians want to go on the news, but definitely the ones they want to share with voters on social media. We also first checked each image for the presence of a person before running the object detection. This excludes photos that only had a dog, for example. Our method also can’t tell if the politician is the one wearing the hi-vis, so if a politician shares a photo of someone else in workwear, it will be counted. These detection methods also don’t have 100% accuracy, so it’s best to treat the following numbers as a minimum count. Here’s the total number of all photos featuring each thing, along with the proportion of all photos in that campaign year: It suggests that politicians are leaning even more heavily into the hi-vis photo opportunity, and leveraging the broad appeal of the cute dog. Novelty cheques however are relatively scarce in this campaign period, and footballs and other sports balls are down on 2019. Now let’s look only at the photos posted by the leaders of the major parties – the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese. For this one, we checked against their actual Facebook feed for any photos our models had missed. Both leaders have had a few campaign moments with dogs, so there’s no surprises there. But Morrison has a higher hi-vis count than Albanese, despite Labor being more usually associated with blue-collar workers. It’s possible that Albanese’s missed days on the campaign trail due to Covid-19 account for this. However, could it be that Albanese’s makeover and relative lower hi-vis count – new suits, glasses and so on – is part of a strategy to make the Labor leader more appealing to business leaders? And could it be the reverse for Morrison – is the party of business making a visual appeal to voters outside their traditional base? This is only speculation, but it’s something to consider. These types of photo opportunities are an inexpensive way to get voters’ attention and communicate a politician’s position on an issue, according to Luke Mansilo, a PhD candidate in political science at the University of Sydney. “‘Dog licks politician’ is a very low-cost way of getting attention, as opposed to paying for advertisements,” he said. “And going to a factory that makes you wear a hi-vis vest does make a really quick, visual short cue for someone who’s not always necessarily paying attention to the news to think, ‘This party is representing the interests of people like me’.” Finally, here are the top 10 politicians ranked by the number of hi-vis and hardhat photos posted during this election campaign: In the lead is the Liberal candidate for Paterson, Brooke Vitnell, who has posted photos from a number of factory visits in the New South Wales electorate where she’s campaigning. Facebook photos for all Labor and Coalition MPs, candidates and senators were scraped for the 2019 and 2022 campaign periods. In 2022 this includes photos posted up to 10 May for everyone except party leaders, who we have updated to 18 May. A number of assumptions have been made in comparing 2019 and 2022, such as that people haven’t deleted photos and generally share photos in the same way in both years. For the object detection machine learning process we used the ImageAI Python library, which is based on TensorFlow. For each of the categories of hi-vis workwear, hardhats and novelty cheques we trained a custom YOLOv3 object detection model. Hi-vis was based on a publicly available dataset of 800 photos, while hardhat detection was based on a publicly available dataset of 1,500 photos. We collated and labelled 310 images of giant cheques to train the cheque-detection model. Dogs, sports balls and people were detected using a RetinaNet model pre-trained on the Coco dataset. Detection thresholds for the key photo op objects were set deliberately low to increase the chance of finding most objects, with false-positives removed by visually inspecting the output.",News/News,Reality cheque: we taught AI to spot the most used props this election.
