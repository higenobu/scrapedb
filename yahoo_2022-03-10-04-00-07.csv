3/10/2022,"McCarthy said MTG and Gosar will still get committee assignments if Republicans retake the majority. That comes after the duo recently appeared at a white nationalist conference, which McCarthy condemned. The GOP House leader also said he's spoken with MTG and she won't attend the conference again. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy reaffirmed on Wednesday that GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona — both of whom recently spoke at a white nationalist conference in Florida — would still be allowed to sit on House committees if Republicans retake the majority. McCarthy previously made the pledge in November, musing at the time that the pair may be given ""better committee assignments"" than they previously had. All House Democrats and two Republicans voted to remove Gosar from two committees in November after his office released an anime video depicting him killing Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Eleven House Republicans joined all Democrats to strip Greene of her committee assignments at the beginning of last year due to her history of incendiary remarks. After Greene made a surprise appearance at the February conference and Gosar spoke via a video address, McCarthy condemned their association with the conference as ""unacceptable"" while calling the gathering ""appalling and wrong."" He also said he would address the issue with both of them. Greene defended her involvement, saying she didn't know it was a white supremacist conference and wanted to speak to ""young conservatives who feel cast aside and marginalized by society."" On Wednesday, when asked by reporters about the meetings, McCarthy said he'd had a meeting with Greene but not Gosar, and that the congresswoman agreed not to attend events held by the group in the future. But he declined to outline any repercussions for their attendance, stating ""my conversations with my members are exactly that."" This marks a reversal from just three years ago, when McCarthy removed former Rep. Steve King of Iowa from his committee assignments after he made comments sympathetic to white supremacists. King later lost his primary election to current Republican Rep. Randy Feenstra of Iowa. Asked by Insider if he stood by his pledge to return Greene and Gosar to committees in light of how he dealt with King, McCarthy doubled down. ""They have the ability to be able to get committees based upon that time when it comes,"" said McCarthy. —Acyn (@Acyn) March 9, 2022 Read the original article on Business Insider",Politics/Business Insider,Kevin McCarthy reaffirms pledge to give Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar committee assignments again after they attended a white nationalist conference,https://news.yahoo.com/kevin-mccarthy-reaffirms-pledge-marjorie-180354531.html
3/10/2022,"A former Russian foreign minister insisted that Vladimir Putin would not use nuclear weapons and the West should not limit its actions or support for Ukraine over fear he would do so. ""The Kremlin knows it can try to extract concessions, whether from Ukraine or the West, by saber-rattling its last remaining card in the deck: nuclear weapons,"" Andrei Kozyrev wrote. ""The ultimate conclusion here is that the West should not agree to any unilateral concessions or limit its support of Ukraine too much for fear of nuclear war."" POWER KNOCKED OUT TO CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR PLANT, UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS SAY: LIVE UPDATES Kozyrev, who served as Russia’s foreign minister between 1991 and 1996, claimed that Putin was still a ""rational actor"" in a series of thoughts posted on Twitter Sunday. Putin, he argued, instead has possibly ""started to believe his own propagandists,"" such as a ""Nazi-Bandera junta"" running the country. RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY ADMITS USE OF CONSCRIPTS IN INVASION, DESPITE PUTIN'S DENIALS Kozyrev laid out three points as to why Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine was ""rational,"" but also ""wrong and immoral"": He genuinely believed that Ukraine was a satellite nation and not an independent nation; the Russian military has suffered rampant corruption; and Putin, along with the Russian elite, believed that President Biden was ""mentally inept"" and the EU was ""toothless."" ""If you believe all three of the above to be true and your goal is to restore the glory of the Russian Empire (whatever that means), then it is perfectly rational to invade Ukraine,"" Kozyrev tweeted. UKRAINE'S CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR POWER PLANT LOSES POWER, SPARKING FEAR OF RADIATION LEAKS And if Putin is acting ""rationally,"" the West should not fear he will engage in nuclear war, Kozyrev added. He also argued that the botched U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan ""solidified"" the narrative of weakness in the West. Instead, President Biden and the EU were able to come together as a unified front through NATO to support Ukraine and hit Russia with crippling sanctions that leave it on the brink of default.",World/Fox News,"Former Russian minister says Putin is 'rational,' West shouldn't 'limit Ukraine support over nuclear fear'",https://news.yahoo.com/former-russian-minister-says-putin-155552877.html
3/10/2022,"Russia's army said on Wednesday that young draftees were sent to fight in its war against Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin previously denied that conscripts were involved in the attack. Some of the conscripts have been captured, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. Russia's military admitted on Wednesday that young draftees were sent to fight in its war against Ukraine after Russian President Vladimir Putin denied that conscripts were involved in the attack. ""Unfortunately, some facts have come to light about the presence of conscript servicemen among the Russian armed forces conducting the special military operation on Ukrainian territory,"" said Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov. ""Practically all of the conscripts have been returned to the territory of the Russian Federation,"" Konashenkov added. Konashenkov said, however, that some of the conscripts have been captured. ""In addition, one of the divisions operating toll security has been attacked by a diversionist group of the national battalion,"" he said, adding, ""A number of military personnel, some of which conscripts, were captured in this attack."" Konashenkov continued, ""Effective immediately, exhaustive measures have been taken to prevent conscripts from entering any and all combat zones, and to free captured personnel."" Earlier this week, Putin said that only ""professional"" Russian soldiers were sent in to invade Ukraine and that he would not send conscripts to fight, according to The Moscow Times. The Kremlin said on Wednesday Putin ordered conscripts to be excluded from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to Russian state media. Before Russia launched its February 24 attack on Ukraine, Putin had instructed all military commanders ""to categorically exclude the involvement of conscripts for any tasks on the territory of Ukraine,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, the state-owned TASS news agency reported. ""In connection with the facts of the presence of a number of conscripts in the units of the armed forces who are participating in a special military operation on the territory of Ukraine, at the direction of the President of Russia, materials have been sent to the Chief Military Prosecutor's Office to verify and legally assess the actions and punish officials responsible for failure to comply with this order,"" Peskov said, according to TASS.
