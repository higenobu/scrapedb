4/6/2022,"Twitter has confirmed it has working on an edit button, but denied the idea came after the company’s new largest shareholder, Elon Musk, held a poll on it. For years, editing a tweet already published has been a sought after feature on the site, to correct typos or embarrassing mistakes. Currently people work around it by deleting and reposting the tweet. In a post on Tuesday, Twitter said it had been working on an edit button since 2021 and would test out the new feature with a selection of people signed up for company’s subscription product – Twitter Blue – in the coming months. In a video to go with the announcement, the edit button sits with other options for tweets, such as “delete tweet”, however the company has not indicated yet what an edited tweet would look like on the site. Twitter said it was still developing the tool. now that everyone is asking…yes, we’ve been working on an edit feature since last year!no, we didn’t get the idea from a poll 😉we're kicking off testing within @TwitterBlue Labs in the coming months to learn what works, what doesn’t, and what’s possible. The company’s head of product, Jay Sullivan, said it had been the most requested feature for many years but warned a potential edit button could be misused without appropriate controls. For example, after a tweet goes viral, the person could change the entire contents of the tweet. Sullivan said “without things like time limits, controls and transparency about what has been edited, Edit could be misused to alter the record of the public conversation”. “Protecting the integrity of that public conversation is our top priority when we approach this work.” He said Twitter would be taking time and seeking input on the feature before it is launched. “We will approach this feature with care and thoughtfulness and we will share updates as we go.” 2/ Edit has been the most requested Twitter feature for many years. People want to be able to fix (sometimes embarrassing) mistakes, typos and hot takes in the moment. They currently work around this by deleting and tweeting again. Twitter announced on Tuesday that Musk would join the board of the company, a day after the world’s richest person became its largest shareholder, taking a 9.2% stake for $2.9bn. Musk’s stake in the company spurred speculation over which changes he would make to the platform, fuelled in part by the billionaire’s Twitter poll for an edit button. Twitter’s chief executive, Parag Agrawal, urged users to “vote carefully” in the poll. The company first posted it was working on an edit button on 1 April, initially suggesting the claim was an April Fool’s Day joke. Tech companies, however, often have a history of turning April Fool’s Day jokes into features. Gmail, for example, was first hinted at by Google on 1 April 2004.",News/Technology,Twitter working on edit button but says idea did not come from Elon Musk,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/06/twitter-working-on-edit-button-but-says-idea-did-not-come-from-elon-musk
4/6/2022,"Neil Finn has spent much of his life onstage, but he’s the first to admit his between-song “patter” is a little rusty. He stops himself in the middle of an anecdote about spending the previous day cycling around Adelaide, perhaps sensing it’s one dad joke too far – even for the demographic mix of a Crowded House show in the year 2022. “It’s a great story isn’t it, Liam?” he says, looking to his eldest son on his right. “I wasn’t going to say anything,” Liam replies drolly. “It’s the first night and all.” It’s been a decade since Finn’s signature band last toured Australia, and almost three years since his most recent lap of the country as the unexpected new member of Fleetwood Mac. And while there’s been turnover in Crowded House’s ranks of late, it’s of a different sort to the turbulent revolving door of Finn’s other band. This incarnation of the group he founded with bassist Nick Seymour and the late Paul Hester in 1986 might technically be a new lineup, but they’re all familiar faces. Finally hitting the road after reuniting just before the pandemic, Finn and a kilt-wearing Seymour are now officially joined by Neil’s sons – Liam on guitar and vocals, and Elroy on drums – while Mitchell Froom, the American producer who cut much of the band’s early, seminal work, sits up the back on keys. For the younger two, this band is in their DNA. On opening song Weather With You, Liam’s indelibly Finn-ish voice effortlessly slots into place alongside his father’s, singing a harmony originated by his uncle Tim during the band’s first family crossover era back in 1991. On 1993’s Pineapple Head, they play along as their dad sings lyrics partly inspired by the incoherent ramblings of a young, feverish Liam. Liam and Elroy are no longer kids, but seasoned performers in their own right – and at 38, Liam is now the same age his father was when the band first farewelled the world back in 1996. Backed by his brother’s steady rhythm, he confidently, reverently metes out those instantly recognisable 12-string guitar melodies – and adds a few chaotic squalls of his own. A few songs in Seymour admits he’s a “a bit puffed”, having contracted Covid around six weeks ago and still feeling it in the lungs. He needn’t worry; this is a crowded house in every sense, and the near-capacity Adelaide Entertainment Centre sings along with gusto. A grinning Neil basks in the sound of several thousand people belting his words back at him, and on hits like Fall At Your Feet and Something So Strong he can’t help but keep the song going, inviting us to sing along once the rest of the band have finished. He even splices in the chorus of his 1980 Split Enz hit I Got You and The Kinks’ Sunny Afternoon for good measure. After such a rousing response to the classics, generous helpings of new material from the band’s recently released seventh album Dreamers Are Waiting inevitably sacrifice some of the energy in the room. While songs like Playing With Fire and the defiant Whatever You Want bring some earwormy hooks and a familiar, dreamlike quality, they are unlikely to upset the tracklist of the next Greatest Hits compilation just yet – but it’s hardly their fault they haven’t had decades to grow on us. For now though, they show us a band with purpose beyond revisiting past glories. To make up for the dip in crowdsourced backing vocals, Neil invites the members of opening band Middle Kids onstage for a few songs, telling the audience it’s one of the few places these tourmates are able to hang. “We can’t really mix backstage – all that bubble shit,” Neil says. When Middle Kids songwriter Hannah Joy makes a joke about a subsequent lack of backstage rock’n’roll antics, he muses that they were never particularly “rock’n’roll”. “These days, just rolls,” he adds. This is a band that after all these years plays with an unspoken, familial fluency, and a lot of love. It’s hard to tell who appreciates it more, the audience or Neil. For some though, it’s a quasi-religious experience: the man beside me leaps to his feet after every song while texting excited observations to his own two sons, and a woman a few rows over gets busted trying to send a scribbled note on to the stage via paper plane. Returning to the stage had been a “joyous occasion”, Neil says in a final thank you to the crowd, but that’s been obvious all night. It’s certainly evident during their biggest hit, Don’t Dream It’s Over, where once again the Finns and their comrades start the song, but the audience helps bring it home. As that big, wistful chorus hangs in the air, Finn beams at the crowd: “Makes me believe it when I hear you sing it.” Crowded House’s Dreamers are Waiting tour continues through April",Arts/Music,Crowded House review – a joyous and long-awaited return to Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/06/crowded-house-review-a-joyous-and-long-awaited-return-to-australia
4/6/2022,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has refused a Queensland government request to help fund a $741m natural disaster resilience package in the wake of severe flooding in Brisbane and the state’s south-east. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, wrote to Morrison on 19 March asking to go halves in the package – which was designed to pay for retrofitting, house raising or the voluntary buyback of flood-damaged homes. In a response received last night, the prime minster said the programs would not be supported by the commonwealth. Morrison said such such measures were “outside the scope” of federal disaster recovery programs and the responsibility of state and local governments. “These programs can and should be directly funded and delivered by the Queensland government in the same way that the commonwealth fully funds significant elements of our own contribution,” Morrison wrote. The rejection prompted an angry statement from the Queensland treasurer and acting premier, Cameron Dick, who said Morrison’s response effectively said “it’s not his problem”. “Every Queenslander needs to know that this letter shows that Scott Morrison does not care about flood victims who need help from all levels of government,” Dick said. “It doesn’t matter if your home floods two, three or four times over, Scott Morrison wants no part in creating an ongoing solution. “Every expert report, including his own royal commission into natural disasters, says that the federal government should be funding disaster resilience, but this prime minister will not take responsibility and do his job to fund it.” The Insurance Council of Australia welcomed the flood resilience program when it was announced in March and called for both state and federal governments to fund such measures. The ICA in February released a report calling for $726m to be invested jointly by the Queensland and federal governments over five years. “This announcement highlights that governments are shifting in their thinking, to learn from the lessons of the current disaster and invest in mitigation ahead of the inevitable next event,” the ICA chief executive, Andrew Hall, said last month. We look forward to further announcements by the federal government, not just for Queensland and New South Wales, but across the country where communities remain vulnerable to extreme weather.”",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison refuses Queensland’s request to split $741m flood resilience funding,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/06/scott-morrison-refuses-queenslands-request-to-split-741m-flood-resilience-funding
4/6/2022,"US Capitol police have apprehended an “aggressive” suspect accused of attacking a congressman and perhaps others. The alleged assailant: an unusually bold fox. Earlier in the day, police had warned of fox encounters in the area and said they were working to trap and relocate any animals. “For your safety, please do not approach any foxes,” police tweeted. A spokesperson for the Capitol police told NPR there had been reports of several bites and that a fox had been spotted on Monday around Senate office buildings. The spokesperson said foxes had been spotted before but described the aggressive behavior as “unusual”. #BREAKING: Captured. pic.twitter.com/LJAn2ZjH9J Punchbowl News later identified at least one of the bitten individuals as Ami Bera, a Democratic congressman from California. “I expect to get attacked if I go on Fox News; I don’t expect to get attacked by a fox,” Bera told Punchbowl News. Rep. Ami Bera confirms he was BIT by the Senate fox last nightHe described attack, which occurred near Russell building, as “unprovoked”“I didn’t see it and all of a sudden I felt something lunge at the back of my leg,” Bera said.“I jumped and got my umbrella,” he continues Bera, who described the attack as “unprovoked”, told Punchbowl that the attack had occurred on Monday night. “I didn’t see it and all of a sudden I felt something lunge at the back of my leg,” the congressman said. “I jumped and got my umbrella.” The fox, meanwhile, appears to have acquired its own publicity team. A Twitter account, @thecapitolfox, tells the animal’s side of the story, and it has released an “official statement”. “Today, I was forcibly removed from my den by very scary and mean individuals. I am innocent of the crimes in question. This will not be the end. “I am a work in progress,” the statement concluded, echoing the words of a film star recently embroiled in a controversy of his own. A reporter for Politico, Ximena Bustillo, also tweeted that she had been bitten. “That feel when you get bit by a fox leaving Capitol, cause that’s of course something I expect in THE MIDDLE OF DC,” she tweeted. On Tuesday evening, Bera tweeted to report that he was “healthy and back at work” after the encounter. “Joking aside, animal bites are extremely serious. In the case of an encounter, please speak with a physician immediately,” he tweeted, including a link to the CDC’s website.
