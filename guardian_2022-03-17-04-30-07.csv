3/17/2022,"The Federal Reserve has raised US interest rates for the first time since 2018 – now all eyes are now on the Bank of England to see whether it increases UK borrowing costs for a third time in succession. Wednesday’s quarter-point increase by the world’s most powerful central bank was never really in doubt. It would have come as a complete shock to Wall Street had the Fed decided to sit on its hands as a result of the war in Ukraine. The US is much less dependent on imported energy than other developed nations and further away from the conflict. The message from Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, was clear: plenty more rate rises – six more quarter-point jumps – are planned before the end of the year. As far as the Fed is concerned, this is now the post-Covid era. For Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee, things are less clear cut and any one of three options is possible: another quarter-point increase; a half-point increase; or no change. There are nine MPC members and they could easily split three ways when it comes to the vote. The reason it is a tough call for the Bank is that the economy is being pulled in two directions at once. On the one hand, inflationary pressure was strong even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine gave an added upward twist to global commodity prices. Yet, on the other, UK households are facing the biggest squeeze on their real – inflation-adjusted – incomes for at least half a century. As the year wears on, and people have to contend with higher energy bills, higher food prices and higher taxes, the deflationary pressure will intensify. A return to 1970s-style stagflation is the worry on both sides of the Atlantic. Larry Summers, the former US treasury secretary, is predicting unemployment and inflation to remain above 5% for the next few years in America, and the same pressures affect the UK, only more so. There is nothing the Bank of England can do to affect the global price of energy or food, but some members of the MPC are jittery about higher prices generating pressure for higher wages. The fear is that in a tight labour market a wage-price spiral will set in. Others on the committee are more concerned about the economy hitting the wall in the second half of 2022. Their fear is that over-aggressive interest rate increases will help push the economy into recession. Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there had been speculation the Bank might get more aggressive with a half-point rise this month. That now looks less probable, although it cannot be entirely ruled out. Nor can the suck-it-and-see approach, although leaving rates unchanged would also be a surprise given that the Bank was expecting inflation to rise above 7% next month even before Vladimir Putin further complicated matters. The likeliest outcome is that the Bank will stick to its policy of gradually edging rates to a more normal setting by raising rates by a quarter-point to 0.75% – returning borrowing costs to their pre-pandemic level – and leave the option open of raising them by a further quarter-point in May, when it will publish updated forecasts for the economy.",News/Business,Bank of England set for tough call on interest rates after US rise,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/16/bank-of-england-interest-rates-us-rise-uk-inflation-economy
3/17/2022,"In a way, the Ukranian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, ruined the Americans’ plans. Early this year, when American intelligence concluded that Vladimir Putin would indeed invade Ukraine, no one expected it to be a long war. The conventional wisdom, shared by western analysts and Putin himself, was that Ukraine would rapidly fall to Russia’s military, and that after some strong words and a tepid round of sanctions, the US and Nato would cut a deal with Russia. They would give Putin hegemony over much of Ukraine – the eastern part, if not the whole thing – and what was left over would get an aspirationally democratic government with a European orientation. This detente would last until Putin got greedy again, at which point the cycle of Russian expansion and western accommodation would resume, this time a little further to the west. At some point in that version of events, Zelenskiy himself would have been arrested by the Russians. And then he’d be gone. Instead, the man who addressed Congress on Wednesday morning did so from a besieged and defiant Kyiv, shelled and bombed nightly by the encircling Russian forces but still in Ukrainian hands. Zelenskiy appeared via video on a large screen at the front of a room full of senators and congresspeople in blue velvet chairs. He was unshaven. He looked unslept. By remaining in Kyiv, even as Russian troops encircle it and Russian bombs fall from the sky, Zelenskiy has made himself into a symbol of the Ukrainian people, whose surprising courage, determination, and defiance in the face of the Russian aggression have called the west’s moral bluff. Their stand, and Zelenskiy’s stand, have transformed what could have been a cynical calculation about how to manage Russia’s renewed imperial ambitions into a more meaningful – and more challenging – test of the west’s pro-democracy values. Days ago, when Americans offered Zelenskiy a discreet and secure exit from Kyiv, he reportedly told them: “I need ammunition, not a ride.” This sounds like action movie dialogue, and at times Zelenskiy’s skillful public rhetoric has evoked his past life as a comedian and entertainer. He has come a long way from the days when his jokes included pretending to play a piano with his dick. But it is difficult to dismiss Zelenskiy’s words as mere macho posturing when one considers that the stakes are his own life. Russia’s lethal power is superior, and though the Ukrainians have mounted an impressive military and guerrilla resistance, it is unlikely that they will be able to permanently hold Kyiv unless something drastic changes in the war. Zelenskiy’s wife and two small children, who fled at the beginning of the invasion, will probably never see him again. His presidency has taken on the tenor of a suicide mission; he broadcast to Congress from the location in Kyiv where he is waiting to die. The contrast between what Zelenskiy has been willing to do for his country’s sovereignty, and what the western leaders on whom he is calling for help have been willing to do for their own professed values, is the source of Zelenskiy’s tremendous moral power. In his addresses to western leaders – he has also spoken to the Canadian and UK parliaments over the past days – Zelenskiy speaks in inspirational tones. But he is looking to evoke the west’s shame. On Wednesday, he spoke to Congress wearing a T-shirt in the dusty green of a military uniform. The American lawmakers who watched him wore suits. In his address, Zelenskiy asked the Americans for the same things he has been asking for since the beginning of the Russian invasion: first, he wants a no-fly zone over Ukraine to stop the incessant and devastating bombing that has killed thousands of Ukrainians, including many civilians. Second, he wants the US to re-enter a deal that it backed out of this past week, in which America and Nato would facilitate the transfer to Ukraine from Poland of Soviet-made MiG military jets – planes that Ukrainian fighters know how to fly, and which could help make Russia’s air war over their country at least a little less asymmetrical. Third, he wants the west, and particularly the US, to continuously strengthen its sanctions on Russia. He called for individual restrictions to be placed on members of Putin’s government and their assets, and he called for American companies to cease operations in Russia. “Their market is flooded with our blood,” he said. He asked, too, for American ports to be closed to Russian-made goods. “Peace is more important than income.” It is one of the most persistent and embarrassing themes of America’s status as a superpower that the US’s values frequently do not align with its interests – or, for that matter, with its capacities. Zelenskiy is likely to get little of what he asked for. A no-fly zone could only be enforced by shooting down Russian planes and taking out Russian air defense operations that are located not only in Ukraine, but also in Belarus and Russia. Putin would see this as an act of war, and the US and Nato would be pulled into a potentially world-ending global conflict. The transfer of planes also seems unlikely: the Pentagon recently rejected American participation in the scheme, fearing that it, too, would be interpreted as an unacceptable escalation by the Russians. Harsher sanctions meant to cripple the Russian economy seem more likely, and like a less dangerous way to channel the considerable political and public support for the Ukrainian cause. The aim of such sanctions is not only punitive, but tactical. Despite the visibility of Russian dissidents in American media, the truth is that a large majority of Russians support Vladimir Putin, and support the war. Putin has the devoted support of the Russian people in no small part because they feel that their autocratic leader has secured Russia’s domestic stability and material prosperity. Sanctions could eventually change this calculation among ordinary Russians, potentially destabilizing Putin’s regime. It will be tempting for many in America to justify their aversion to further military escalation in eastern Europe by denying the moral authority of the Ukrainian cause. Those on the Republican right, confused about their party’s relationship to the Putin regime, will try to paint Ukraine as a corrupt denizen of decadence. Those on the far left will point to the mujahideen in Afghanistan as an example of the dangers of American support for anti-Russian militias. But this rhetoric will largely function as a distraction from what is really happening in Ukraine. Zelenskiy is right that his people have a moral claim, as he said to Congress, to “Live in their own country and choose their own future.” He is right, too, that watching Putin deny Ukraine this right should make us all ashamed. But he is wrong to think that America has the power, really, to stop him. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist",Opinion/Opinion,Zelenskiy wants to shame the west into action.

3/17/2022,"Appearances can be deceptive. Most people had Liz Truss down as someone of mediocre talents. Not least Boris Johnson. After all, that’s why he made her foreign secretary. No prime minister wants someone too capable in a top job. But it now turns out that Truss isn’t quite so useless after all. At the very least, she’s managed to do something that was beyond previous foreign secretaries. Unlike the Suspect, she didn’t actively make the situation worse by ensuring she got Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe banged up for longer by falsely accusing her of training journalists in Iran. And unlike Jeremy Hunt and Dominic Raab, she actually got something done. There again, she hadn’t tried to supervise operations from a sunbed while the sea was closed. So it was an understandably triumphant Truss who came to the Commons midway through Wednesday afternoon to give a statement on the release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori and the release on furlough of Morad Tahbaz. As well she might. It’s not every day a foreign secretary achieves something that not only unites all sides of the house but also gives a lift to an entire country that has looked on in horror at Iran’s prolonged and illegal detention of British citizens. Truss made sure to share the credit with some cursory drive-by thanks to colleagues and rather more heartfelt and deeper gratitude to the families and constituency MPs of the detainees who had campaigned for their release. But Liz was careful to reserve her greatest praise for herself. In her short six-minute statement, she managed to use the word I at least 15 times. A hymn to her. It wasn’t entirely clear how Truss had managed to pull off this high-level diplomacy. Though the gist of it seemed to be that she had neither been quite so averse to repaying a legitimate £400m debt nor to having the repayment quite clearly linked to the return of hostages. Indeed Liz protested extremely loudly that the timing was entirely coincidental and that the Iranians had undertaken only to use the money for humanitarian purposes. No one was entirely convinced by this, but she had earned the benefit of the doubt. It was also possible that the war in Ukraine had concentrated minds in the British government. Repaying the debt was the least we could do to get access to, and preferential rates on, Iranian oil. But no one thought to bring up the tawdry odds of realpolitik having played as big a role in the release as the irresistibly honeyed tones of Truss’s golden voice. Then this wasn’t a day for that. With Richard Ratcliffe and his daughter Gabriella smiling and waving happily in the public gallery, this was above all a human story. The day when families would be reunited after years of campaigning and hunger strikes. As Nazanin’s MP, Labour’s Tulip Siddiq, observed, Richard had “raised the bar impossibly high for husbands everywhere”. And, for whatever bonus gains, Truss had done the right thing. She had made a difference where others had failed and for that alone she deserved her moment in the sun. It just so happened that Raab, one of her ineffectual predecessors, was standing in for another, the Suspect, who was off to Saudi Arabia in search of cheap oil – make that to raise human rights abuses and to agree a renewable energy deal, at prime minister’s questions. And as so often when he’s called to deputise, Raab couldn’t quite hack it. His default position is one of anger. The vein in his forehead throbs under the Commons lights and he responds to everything as if he was under police interrogation. For the past few weeks, party politics has taken rather a back seat at PMQs as both leaders have tried to put on a display of unity over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. And today there were several Ukrainian MPs in the gallery to keep an eye on the British parliament. Though not for long. They all upped and left after 15 minutes. Probably just as well. Because with Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, asking the questions, things quickly turned tribal. Studs up. It wasn’t vintage Rayner. It was too careless and scatter gun. But it was effective enough. Rayner’s argument was basically this: if Johnson was the wrong person to lead the country before the war he was the wrong person to lead it during it. She rattled through selected highlights from the charge sheet. The Suspect had ignored the concerns of intelligence chiefs over Evgeny Lebedev’s peerage. He had fallen over himself to cultivate the affections of oligarchs – so much so that he had lost his own security detail so he could get trashed with Evgeny in Italy. His energy policy was to hustle the world’s despots for cheap deals. He was so morally incontinent he couldn’t even obey his own lockdown rules. The Vein had no real response. Other than to lie about the intelligence services and to dismiss the rest of Rayner’s criticism as nonsense. Boris was just a social animal. One with a pathetically needy attraction to other people’s cash. He also harked back to her support for Jeremy Corbyn as leader. Rayner looked momentarily disconcerted. Though she might have remembered that Johnson had also been a big fan of Vladimir Putin a few years back and had blamed the EU for Russia’s invasion of Crimea. Then, as Dom would later admit when asked about statistics, he isn’t the biggest fan of the truth. For the most part, the Tory backbenchers watched on with a sense of disinterest. As if this was a Championship fixture. A few roused themselves to heckle. How dare she call out the prime minister at a time like this! Boris was now a National Treasure. We’ll be the judge of that. And a bunch of men trying to tell a woman she’s adopting the wrong tone is never a great look.",News/Politics,Liz Truss heaps praise on self for Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/16/liz-truss-heaps-praise-on-self-for-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffes-release
3/17/2022,"Watching Michael O’Leary watch Tiger Roll come up just short in his 45th and final race was a singularly fascinating experience. As the tapes went up in the Cross Country Chase, a contest National Hunt’s now retired national treasure had won twice previously, his owner separated himself from his small entourage, leaned against the back of the presentation podium in the winner’s enclosure and gazed impassively at the nearest big screen. There he remained throughout the duration of the 3m 6f race, protected from the day’s relentless downpour by a blue bobble hat and beige overcoat. He neither moved a muscle nor registered a flicker of emotion until his ludicrously brave superstar was pipped on the run-in. The Ryanair boss had said in the build-up to the Festival that “Cheltenham doesn’t do fairytales” and while that’s not strictly true, on this occasion he was absolutely right. The victim of a late smash-and-grab on his swansong, Tiger Roll was ultimately denied his happy-ever-after ending by Delta Work; the same Delta Work who was ridden by Jack Kennedy, trained by Gordon Elliott and owned by … Michael O’Leary. “Wrong fucking horse!” he exclaimed, shaking his head as he rejoined his wife in the parade ring. “Wrong fucking horse! I was actually kind of hoping Jack would take a pull on Delta.” Less than an hour before the off, O’Leary had advised punters that “anyone who is still thinking of backing Tiger needs their heads examined”. His warning came after a day of almost apocalyptic rainfall that began at 9.30am, continued all day and rendered the conditions underfoot highly unsuitable for a horse known for his preference for good ground. Unbeknownst to his owner, Tiger Roll had other ideas and on a filthy, dirty Festival day he sparked the bedraggled hordes in the stands and bars into life as he moved clear of the chasing pack at the start of the third and final circuit under a patient ride from Davy Russell. An on-off partnership that first tasted victory in the Triumph Hurdle here eight years ago, Russell and Tiger Roll have since won back-to-back Grand Nationals, while Wednesday marked the horse’s attempt to register a record-equalling sixth Festival win in the last race of his storied career. Despite the diabolical conditions, they looked set to pull off the most unlikely of wins until Delta Work and Kennedy pooped their party, reducing O’Leary to tears and prompting loud boos and catcalls from the sentimentalists and romantics in the grandstand. “I really would have loved to have seen Tiger go out with a win,” said his owner in an emotional post-race interview. “He went out on his shield, he’s a warrior. He’s phenomenal. That’s a Gold Cup horse after beating him over three miles on ground he wouldn’t like. I’m actually upset because I would have loved to see him win it. I’m going to shoot Jack Kennedy when I see him! You think the dream is going to happen when he jumps the last and then he just gets mugged.” Introduced to the Festival in 2005 and run over almost four miles, the Cross Country Steeplechase is not every racegoer’s – or indeed racehorse’s – cup of tea. Something of a novelty event, it is a different kind of white-knuckle ride for jockeys who, as well as taking the usual risks to life and limb, must commit an almost preposterously complex route to memory, or at the very least make sure to stay hot on the heels of a weigh room colleague they know to have walked and studied the course. Runners and riders negotiate a serious of tight turns over three circuits, none of which are the same, while negotiating 32 different obstacles of all shapes and sizes including banks, ditches, fences, stuffed hurdles, timber rails, a Grand National tribute jump and the infamous cheese wedges. Equine versatility and adaptability are key, while course experience is hugely advantageous. On Wednesday the gruelling distance and awful conditions rendered stamina a particular pre-requisite. While Tiger Roll came up agonisingly short, there are plenty of racing fans who will have little or no sympathy for O’Leary and not just because one of his other entrants won the race. In recent years he has been waging his own very public war with the British Horseracing Authority’s handicapper, in the process denying the general public the opportunity to see Tiger Roll try to emulate Red Rum by winning – or at least trying to win – a third Grand National.

After pulling Tiger Roll from last year’s Grand National in a row over the horse’s weight allocation, toxic hostilities resumed again this year despite a 5lb drop in the ratings from last year’s mark. Describing handicapper Martin Greenwood’s calculations as “absurd” and “idiotic”, O’Leary once again scratched Tiger Roll from this year’s Grand National field despite him being given a perfectly reasonable weight for a horse of his age and previous experience. It has not gone unobserved that Red Rum won his third National at an identical age, while carrying 4lb more over a longer distance with far more treacherous fences. While his heroic defeat in the Cross Country showed Tiger Roll’s courage is unquestionable, many will argue the bravery of his owner doesn’t stand up to quite the same scrutiny.",Sport/Sport,‘He went out on his shield’: brave Tiger Roll bids farewell without his fairytale,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/16/he-went-out-on-his-shield-brave-tiger-roll-bids-farewell-without-his-fairytale
3/17/2022,"Black and minority ethnic chemists face “pervasive” inequalities that restrict their access to research funding and derail their academic careers, according to a new report by the Royal Society of Chemistry. The report found that while black students were well represented at undergraduate level, very few were able to develop academic careers, with only one black professor of chemistry out of the 575 professors working in UK universities. Prof Robert Mokaya, of the University of Nottingham, said he was not aware he was the only black professor of chemistry when he was appointed nearly 15 years ago. “It only became clear to me as I didn’t interact with any others,” he said. He said for many students, progressing on a career path from postgraduate degree to research fellowship to a first lectureship required support as well as ability. “Unless somebody has got support from the community around them it can be very difficult – you need references and you need people to talk about your abilities,” he said. “If those who are able to offer that support do not feel inclined to offer it, then it can disadvantage some groups. “Or some people are not seen as having the potential for that career path and are not given a push. It then becomes very discouraging and difficult to move on.” The Royal Society of Chemistry’s report, Missing Elements, found that black and minority ethnic chemists were paid less than their white peers, and were less likely to receive research funding at crucial points in their careers. The society said it would establish a new race and ethnicity unit, with £1.5m funding, to push for systemic change and increased diversity. “People need to engage with the data and the lived experiences in this report and not assume that it is going to be somebody else’s problem to deal with it. Everybody within the chemistry community and science in general can make a contribution,” said Mokaya, who is a trustee of the society. MPs on the Commons science and technology committee were told of the “shocking” numbers of research grants going to black academics working in science and technology. Prof Rachel Oliver, of the University of Cambridge, told the committee that the government’s UK Research and Innovation councils made about 4,000 research grants in 2018-2020, but only 20 went to projects led by black researchers. “These are tiny numbers – if I start to try and talk about these numbers in terms of black women, there are so few black women that the numbers are simply not written down because you’d be able to identify the individual,” Oliver said. “The numbers are shocking.” She said figures showed that women, ethnic minorities and disabled people were less likely to apply for research funding, and less likely to be successful if they did. “And when they do receive funding, the amounts they receive are smaller than the amounts received by their white male counterparts,” she added. She said small biases accumulated, having a big impact on career progression. “It perhaps isn’t surprising that, across a 40-year career, we end up with a very large number of white male professors and a very small number of black female professors. That’s really at the heart of what we have to tackle.”",News/Education,"‘Pervasive’ inequality derailing black UK chemists’ careers, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/16/pervasive-inequality-derailing-black-uk-chemists-careers-report-finds

3/17/2022,"Russia’s offensive around Kyiv appears to have largely ground to a halt – despite the regular bombing of residential areas in the capital – as the invaders attempt to regroup and resupply in the north-west and east of Ukraine. A week ago, the influential Institute of the Study of War, a US thinktank tracking the fighting, had thought that an encirclement of the capital could be achieved within “24 to 96 hours” – but the events of recent days have prompted it to change its mind. On Monday and Tuesday, the Russian invaders could only muster local attacks involving a few hundred troops, leading the expert monitors to conclude that Russian forces were “likely unable to complete the encirclement of Kyiv or resume mobile offensive operations in north-eastern Ukraine in the near future”. Some of this has been down to a spirited resistance from Ukrainian forces, who have managed to prevent the Russian advance on both sides of the capital to the suburbs beyond the city, around Brovary to the east and most notably around Irpin to the north-west, a once leafy district that has been the centre of fighting for over a fortnight. Russian forces appear to have been proven unable to cross the Irpin River, which runs along the western edge of the city – and the invaders remain 20km or more from the city centre, ruling out the cruel use of short-range artillery against the population that has proved so damaging in the eastern cities of Mariupol and Kharkiv. That may offer some respite, but a critical period looms, if the war continues. The question is whether the Russian forces complete an encirclement of Kyiv and begin what could be a fearful siege of the city, which had a population of about 3 million people before the war began. Mathieu Boulègue, a research fellow at Chatham House, said in an event organised by the thinktank on Tuesday that “the danger of bombing of city centres” underlined the importance of “preventing a battle of Kyiv” – because Russia has no other way of capturing its most important strategic objective. Three weeks into the conflict, footage from Kyiv showed the effort to defend the city centre with military reservists, volunteer soldiers who are former journalists, lawyers and prosecutors, guarding defences built out of sandbags. Steel “hedgehogs” lie scattered in the roads, intended to stop Russian armour from advancing at speed and generate opportunities for ambush. But as Boulègue pointed out, Russia has sought to avoid urban warfare so far in the conflict – where it is considered that an attacker needs numbers of five to one in its favour to have a chance of success. Instead, as Russian forces close in on a city, they have resorted to “ground shelling and indiscriminate bombardment” said Boulègue, to break the will of the residents to resist. For both sides in the war, Kyiv is everything, and uncertainty also lingers over what would happen if Russia cannot close in on the city – or if its inhabitants fight vigorously in its defence, as expected. Boulègue worried that could lead to “increased frustration and risk-taking by the Kremlin”. Western leaders have repeatedly voiced concern – denied by Russia – that Moscow could use chemical weapons in Ukraine. Even if those fears were not realised, as Russia has showed throughout the conflict, it can launch cruise missile strikes on city centre targets, as happened in Kharkiv, or air-to-ground strikes, as against the Yavoriv military base at the weekend. For now, Russia’s forces are pegged back. But an uneasy wait in the capital goes on.",News/World news,Uneasy wait in Kyiv continues as Russian advance appears to have stalled,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/uneasy-wait-in-kyiv-continues-as-russian-advance-appears-stalled
3/17/2022,"Vulnerable students at a British boarding school had sex in front of another pupil and others were able to sneak out and drink themselves unconscious because they were so poorly supervised, inspectors have found. “Serious failures” were identified at Ampleforth college, a Catholic boarding school in North Yorkshire that charges £37,905 a year. Ofsted inspectors found that arrangements to safeguard vulnerable pupils were ineffective, particularly outside the classroom. “Some younger pupils, whose vulnerabilities include Send [special educational needs and disability], were able to engage in penetrative sexual activity, observed by another pupil, because levels of staff supervision were not sufficient to protect them,” the Ofsted report says. The school denies that any sex took place, saying that police investigated and found “no implication of penetration”. It says a witness to the incident, which occurred when the children were getting changed for PE, reported “a three-second incident in which both [students] were laughing”. Whistleblowers contacted Ofsted after 81 year 13 students sneaked out of their boarding houses at 2am on their last day of school for a party. One pupil was admitted to hospital due to alcohol intoxication, the inspection report says, adding: “Another was missing for one hour after everyone else was back in their boarding houses. The pupil was found unconscious and alone in an orchard. At the same time, leaders located class A drugs in the boarding house.” The school says the pupil who went missing was only gone for 15 minutes and was not found passed out, adding: “The students planned and coordinated their departure from the boarding houses after 2am, and damaged or disabled the security systems in order to evade detection. This is a matter of great regret and they were disciplined in a manner which reflected the seriousness of the incident.” The school also denies Ofsted’s claim that “monks of concern” – who have been accused or found guilty of child sexual abuse – could still live in the adjacent abbey. The school said there was a protocol in place that ensured that “there are no monks currently subject to a police investigation or without a current enhanced DBS [disclosure and barring service] check in place living at Ampleforth Abbey”. Commenting on the report’s publication, Robin Dyer, head of Ampleforth, said: “We are deeply disappointed that Ofsted should have produced a report based on a number of incorrect assumptions and factual inaccuracies regarding our safeguarding.

3/17/2022,"The Portuguese government is to tighten the law granting nationality to the descendants of Jews who were expelled from the Iberian peninsula 500 years ago, as concerns grow over the controversial decision to award Roman Abramovich citizenship because of his apparent Sephardic Jewish heritage. The Russian oligarch and Chelsea FC owner, who is now subject to UK and EU sanctions because of his ties to Vladimir Putin, was granted Portuguese citizenship last year under a 2015 law designed to make amends for the mass banishments at the end of the 15th century. On Wednesday, however, the Portuguese government said it had decided to modify the nationality-by-descent law to prevent the legislation being “manipulated”. The move comes as the Portuguese prosecutor’s office investigates how Abramovich was awarded his citizenship, and days after the rabbi who certified the oligarch’s Sephardic descent was arrested in the city of Oporto. The foreign minister, Augusto Santos Silva, said a new decree would introduce “a requirement for [applicants to demonstrate an] effective connection with Portugal”. According to Portugal’s Público newspaper, the proposed changes to the law could require applicants to provide proof of a material connection to the country, such as evidence of visits or inherited property there. Last December, the Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, hit out at Portugal’s decision to grant citizenship to Abramovich, describing him as “the closest oligarch to Putin and one of his wallets”, adding: “He finally managed to find a country where you can give some bribes and make some semi-official and official payments to end up in the EU and Nato – on the other side of Putin’s frontline, so to speak.” Santos Silva described Navalny’s criticism as “profoundly unfair” and said “the idea that Portuguese civil servants carry suitcases of money is insulting”. Daniel Litvak, the chief rabbi of the Jewish Community of Oporto, was arrested last week and is understood to be under investigation for the alleged offences of “influence peddling, active corruption, document forgery, money laundering, qualified tax fraud and criminal association”. Meanwhile, a separate inquiry into the use of the citizenship law has already led to the start of disciplinary proceedings against employees at Portugal’s Institute of Registries and Notary, which provides nationality and passport services. In a statement, the Jewish Community of Oporto said: “As soon as Jewish communities start making their mark in European territory, the influential antisemites in society will attempt to destroy Jewish life bit by bit, synagogue by synagogue, organisation by organisation, using the same methods once employed in the Soviet Union.” It described the allegations against Litvak as “unbelievable anonymous denunciations” and said that while it had received the sum of €250 from Abramovich, it had “worked in full transparency and maintained rigorous and honest standards” while evaluating Sephardic ancestries. The community also said that it was no longer interested in collaborating with the Portuguese state in certifying people as Sephardic Jews. It declined to comment on whether the oligarch was a direct or indirect benefactor of the community, whether it remained confident about Abramovich’s certification, or whether it was reviewing the decision. According to a document on its website, “certificates may be annulled if it comes to the committee’s notice that false documents were used in the certification process”. The community’s website says the “overwhelming majority” of the certificates issued have been granted to descendants from traditional Sephardic families who have lived for centuries in the Balkans, the Middle East and north Africa. To date, almost 57,000 people have been granted Portuguese nationality under the 2015 law. A similar but more stringent Spanish law, which was introduced a year earlier, requires proof of ties to Spain as well as taking a language and culture test. It attracted more than 132,000 applications before the deadline of 1 October 2019. Spain’s Federation of Jewish Communities, which certifies applications, said it had received petitions from Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina, the US, Israel, Panama, Ecuador, Brazil, Turkey, France, the UK, Serbia and Montenegro, Peru, Chile, Morocco and Afghanistan.",News/World news,Portugal to change law under which Roman Abramovich gained citizenship,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/portugal-nationality-by-descent-law-roman-abramovich-citizenship
3/17/2022,"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s return to the UK is first and foremost a moment of joy for her family; politics can wait. A mother and her young daughter, separated for nearly six years, can hold each other again. The loss of those years and the terror of not knowing how much longer the captivity would go on are hard for others to fathom. But that does not prevent us sharing gratitude that the ordeal is over. The longing for reunion was a private grief, but its realisation has lifted public spirits. The relief is contagious. Richard Ratcliffe’s fortitude through the years of demanding that the government do whatever was required to secure his wife’s freedom has its deserved reward. He was wise to ignore Foreign Office requests that he be quieter on the subject. Much of the diplomacy that led to her release and that of Anoosheh Ashoori, another British citizen, who has spent four years in an Iranian jail, will remain secret. It is unclear why Morad Tahbaz, a third detainee, was not on the same flight. He has been released from prison but remains under house arrest. Some opacity is inevitable in negotiations to release hostages. That is not the term used by the authorities in Tehran, of course. There were judicial processes, of a sort – bogus charges of espionage. But the affectation of legality cannot sanitise an act as vicious as kidnapping for ransom. It has been known for some time that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release depended on the UK government’s readiness to repay a debt dating back to an uncompleted tank procurement in the 1970s. In public, ministers used to insist that the two issues were separate. The case inevitably became tangled in the wider web of strategic manoeuvres around the deal to ease western sanctions in exchange for suspension of Iran’s nuclear programme. It might also be relevant that Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has forced a reappraisal of western strategic priorities. Recognition of the need to reduce dependency on Russian energy exports puts a different complexion on relations with Iran, which happens also to be the site of vast natural gas reserves. That is all strategic backdrop. Closer to the foreground is ministers’ recognition that the tank debt was “legitimately owed” to Iran – a view privately held in the Foreign Office for some time. Signalling willingness to pay (which also required overcoming US objections to the payment) has made the difference to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her fellow detainees. Liz Truss deserves credit for facilitating a breakthrough that eluded her predecessors. One former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, made matters worse. In 2017, he publicly muddled the record of why Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been in Iran when arrested, saying she had been teaching journalism – a mistake that reinforced Tehran’s version of events. In truth, she had been on holiday. Credit is also due to Tulip Siddiq, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s MP, for pursuing her constituent’s cause with tenacity. But it is the courage of the hostages themselves that is humbling in these circumstances. There is political intrigue that goes into securing a hostage release. That effort must continue for Mr Tahbaz. Much of the process necessarily unfolds in diplomatic shadows; in the dark. But Wednesday’s reunion of families that have been cruelly separated for too long shines out as a beacon of joyful light in sombre times.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: a ray of light | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/16/the-guardian-view-on-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-a-ray-of-light
