4/23/2022,"“Every time we prepped a cauliflower for the florets there were all these ‘ribs’ leftover, so we chopped them up and made them into kimchi,” says Tom Hill, chef, fermenter and owner of Duck Soup and Little Duck The Picklery in London. Hill noticed greengrocers trimming cauliflowers and other vegetables, throwing the offcuts into a compost box, and this spurred him on to save more waste in his own kitchens, realising that vegetable offcuts could be fermented into high-value food products. Cauliflower leaves can be tough, which is why I presume they’re usually discarded, but fermentation breaks them down and converts the leaves into the most remarkable condiment. Have a look in the grocer’s reject box and there’s bound to be something you can ferment: cauliflower leaves, imperfect vegetables, very ripe tomatoes and blemished ingredients, which are all fine with a wash and trim. Cauliflowers come cradled in a fibrous, leafy green that can be tough, but is delicious when prepped with a little know-how, and then roasted or fermented, as in this recipe adapted from Tom Hill’s kohlrabi kimchi from his cookbook, with Clare Lattin, Ducksoup. I’ve made a plant-based version and have swapped fish sauce for seaweed, kohlrabi for cauliflower and removed the sugar, as I find cauliflower sweet enough. Hill recommends fermenting cauliflower leaves and stems for a month at room temperature before refrigerating to make sure they are broken down and “cooked” by the good bacteria. Traditionally, kimchi greens are salted for several hours, but I’ve skipped this process as there is no saucy base of rice porridge like in some more traditional recipes. Here, the vegetable liquid creates a sauce with the pungent aromatics. This recipe for cauliflower rib kimchi is written for the greens, stalks and leaves from one cauliflower. The aromatics can be tweaked to your taste, adding more or less garlic, ginger, soy sauce, gochugaru or other mild chilli flakes. 300g cauliflower leaves and the white core1 tsp garlic cloves, peeled2 tsp chopped fresh ginger, unpeeled2 tbsp light soy sauce or tamari2 tsp gochugaru, or another mild chilli flake2g seaweed – I used wakame (optional) Trim the leaves and stems from a large cauliflower and finely cut the core into matchsticks. Leave the small, tender leaves whole. Remove the leaves from any thick, fibrous stems and leave whole, then cut the thick stems across the grain into 5-10mm pieces. Altogether you should have about 300g - make up the weight with other leafy greens, if necessary. Wash everything in a colander and leave to drain. Sprinkle with a teaspoon of salt and massage into the leaves. Mix the minced garlic with the minced ginger, light soy sauce, gochugaru (or another mild chilli flake or powder, to taste) and massage into the cauliflower greens, adding the optional dried seaweed, if you like. Pack into a 500ml jam jar and press down so the liquid rises above the surface of the vegetables, topping up with water if necessary. Cover with a loose lid and leave to ferment at room temperature (out of direct sunlight) for at least a week, or a month for best results.

4/23/2022,"Agroup of Ukrainian infantry soldiers stood in a warehouse in south-western Ukraine when they were shelled by Russian artillery. Serhiy was hit in the face with shrapnel. He and his recent best friend Hennadiy took a selfie clutching part of the shell which did not hit them. Moments later, Russian tanks appeared on a hill opposite and fired across the village in front of them, including at the warehouse. Hennadiy and the rest of the group – all natives of the Zaporizhzhia region – were also hit by shrapnel and all of them suffered hearing damage. “They had three tanks on the hill and they were just shooting down at us. We just had rifles,” said Hennadiy. “We had some equipment that the Americans and Poles gave us, but it wasn’t enough to fight.” They said they escaped from the warehouse under plumes of smoke and walked to the next village, from where they were taken to the Zaporizhzhia military hospital. The Guardian was granted access to the military hospital to speak to soldiers on the condition that reporters not identify specific locations of battles or publish the full names of soldiers interviewed. “There are plenty of people motivated to fight,” said Serhiy, speaking from a hospital ward with the rest of the company who escaped from the warehouse. “But we are underarmed and desperately trying to hold the whole mass [of the Russian army].” “There’s also just not enough time to train everyone who wants to fight,” added Dmytro, another member of the company, who was lying on a bed in the ward. Ukraine has criticised the west for dripfeeding it arms, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealing almost daily because his country cannot manufacture the weapons or ammunition it needs to fight off the Russian invaders. Equipment demanded has ranged from fighter jets and tanks, which the west has been reluctant or slow to supply, through to artillery and armoured vehicles – and most simply of all guns and ammunition. On Thursday the US said it would supply another $800m (£620m) worth of arms, including 72 howitzers, taking the total value of its arms supply to more than $3bn since the war began, including “more than 50m rounds of ammunition” according to the US president, Joe Biden. However, even when weapons are supplied it can take a fortnight or more before they arrive in Ukraine. Other major countries have been slower or more reluctant, most notably Germany, which has scaled back the heavy weapons it is prepared to offer Ukraine and whose chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has admitted that the stockpiles of what it is prepared to send are running short. The speed at which Ukraine’s forces are using arms and ammunition has also surprised the west, which has begun to ramp up industrial production in an attempt to help Kyiv hold out. Ukrainian forces are currently holding a line which stretches hundreds of miles from Kharkiv in the north-east to outside Mykolaiv in the south-west. Serhiy, whose face was cut up by the shrapnel, was happy to have his picture taken despite the risks, as pointed out to him by a military press secretary, were he to be captured by Russian forces. “We’re not afraid of anything,” said Serhiy. The Guardian confirmed once more before publication that permission was granted to use the soldiers’ images. Earlier that day, the group had avoided fire from a Russian plane. “A plane came over us and bombed us a little bit. It was a bit unpleasant,” said Serhiy, with a smile. “Well, actually, not a bit, utterly unpleasant.” Another member of the group who escaped from the warehouse, Mykola, said the Russians had drones and knew exactly where their positions were. “Things are very hard,” said Mykola. “I can only speak for our situation. I don’t know what it’s like for the other [battalions].” Out of all the cities in central and eastern Ukraine, Zaporizhzhia city feels like the one where life is closest to how it was pre-war, but Russian forces occupy more than 70% of Zaporizhzhia region. Twenty per cent of the region meanwhile makes up Ukraine’s southern front, and is a battle zone between Russian and Ukrainian forces. New restrictions placed on movements of journalists south of Zaporizhzhia city seem to indicate that the situation on the southern front is worsening. According to soldiers interviewed by the Guardian, Ukrainian forces were pushed out of at least one of the three towns and villages an hour south of the city that the New York Times visited three weeks ago. The military press secretary for Zaporizhzhia region, Ivan Ariefiev, said journalists were not allowed to travel to those places now, but said that this was not because the situation on the front was worsening. He said the travel restrictions were because the active phase of the war on the southern front had begun. A group of soldiers the Guardian visited in Zaporizhzhia region were around seven miles (12km) from Russian positions. They did not expect the fighting to reach them quickly and said that the lines further south would hold – though shells were landing between two and three miles away. They said they lacked medical equipment. Between 23 people, they had just six helmets and six tourniquets – some of them hand-sewn by civilian volunteers. They said that while the helmets were on their way from Poland, volunteers and suppliers were struggling to find tourniquets even abroad. The injured soldiers back in the hospital said they received an overwhelmingly warm welcome from local villagers, who often bought them food. On their retreat, they took the number plates off the cars they used so that the Russian soldiers would not be able to identify locals who lent them vehicles. There have been widespread reports of local residents suspected of aiding the Ukrainian army being tortured and even killed by Russian forces. Serhiy said he used his own car to get around the battlefield for just under two months before being injured and abandoning it. “I’ll never get [the car] back,” said Serhiy. “Although maybe it will return to me itself.”",News/World news,Motivated but outgunned: Ukrainian soldiers discuss life on the southern front,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/motivated-but-outgunned-ukrainian-soldiers-discuss-life-on-the-southern-front
4/23/2022,"Amber Heard maintained her composure throughout former husband Johnny Depp’s $50m defamation suit against her last week. That is, until her lawyers played a video of Depp, pouring himself a beaker of wine, raging and shouting “Motherfucker!” as he smashed up or into the kitchen cabinets. Heard’s neutral disposition collapsed, she dropped her head and appeared close to tears. What the jury makes of that video, filmed by Heard herself in one of the couple’s marital homes, several court observers hinted on Thursday, could decide the outcome of an action that turns on a 2018 Washington Post opinion article in which Heard wrote she had become “a public figure representing domestic abuse”. Last week in the current case, being heard in Fairfax, Virginia, the video of Depp shouting was shown during cross-examination after two days of unchallenged testimony from the Pirates of the Caribbean star. During that earlier evidence he discussed his abusive upbringing, his struggles with drug addiction and alcoholism, he offered musings on brain chemistry, and a self-serving interpretation of the collapse of his career after allegations of domestic abuse surfaced in 2016, the re-educations of #MeToo and other topics. If his defamation case against Heard was purely a legal matter, Depp’s presentation could have been cut short. Instead, it was arguably also an audition, or re-audition, designed to remind the public of his charisma and why he had shot to fame at a young age in quirky, romantic roles like Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and Dead Man. But the Depp of recent years, in his Keith Richards-parodying role in Pirates of the Caribbean, surrounded by acolytes, managers, bodyguards, lesser-stature actors, concierge doctors, psychotherapists, nurses – all of whom have given supportive testimony – is a more challenging proposition. At the culmination of Thursday’s cross-examination, jurors were shown pictures of bloody daubings that Depp had made with a partially severed finger in Australia; tape recordings of the actor moaning in the bathroom of a private jet, throwing up, and recordings of Heard trying to reason with her inflamed and intoxicated husband. “What happened? All I did was say sorry,” Heard says on the video. “Did something happen to you? I don’t think so. You drank this whole thing this morning? You’re smashing shit.” Whatever the outcome of the trial – Heard is counter-suing for $100m – Depp’s testimony, regardless of what the court ultimately makes of it has made for uncomfortable viewing as he has issued repeated apologies to the jury for the trial’s exhibits. “I’ll just say that I’m not proud of any of the language that I used,” he offered from the stand last week, and said he often used “dark humor” to express himself. “Functionally it’s a libel trial but it’s also the divorce case that never was,” says Amber Melville-Brown, head of the US media and reputation team at the law firm Withers. “Theses kinds of acrimonious accusations lobbed back and forth are of the kind you’d expect in a nasty divorce.” The couple settled out of court in 2017, with Depp paying his wife $7m, Heard keeping their two teacup yorkies, Pistol and Boo, and a horse named Arrow. Depp kept his real estate assets, including properties in Los Angeles, Paris and a private island in the Bahamas and 40 vehicles. At the time, the couple issued a statement: “Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.” To Depp, that agreement came apart with Heard’s Washington Post article. Heard’s lawyers claim she is exempt to libel claims under Virginia’s current anti-Slapp law that provides legal “immunity” for certain claims based on speech regarding a matter of public concern. Either way, says Melville-Brown, entering into the libel courts, whether in the US or in the UK, where Depp already lost an action against the Sun newspaper in 2020 for calling him a “wife-beater”, is a high-stakes move. Depp has argued that Heard was the one who became violent in the relationship. “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result,” Melville-Brown says. “He is expecting a different result. This is a different case under different law with different evidence, different parties, different witnesses, but it all comes down to the same basic allegation.” In court last week, much of the testimony focused on dueling portraits of Depp: the “southern gentleman” described by a former Heard assistant, or a “monster” as both Depp and Heard came to describe his personality change under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Near the start of their marriage, in 2015, Depp texted a former security guard. “We’ve been perfect. All I had to do was send the monster away and lock him up, we’ve been happier than ever,” he wrote. To one of his doctors, he said: “I have locked my monster child away in a cage deep within and it has fucking worked.” But the monster, Heard’s attorneys argue, kept reappearing, while Depp has countered that Heard used the word to describe when she thought he was using drugs or alcohol – and that her perception was not always correct. “Let’s drown her before we burn her,” Depp texted the actor Paul Bettany in 2013. “I will fuck her burnt corpse afterward to make sure she is dead.” Early in the case, Depp said his public image had gone from “Cinderella to Quasimodo” overnight when Heard made her abuse allegations in People magazine in 2016. Depp was dropped from the Pirates franchise and has had little movie work since. Depp’s Quasimodo allegory is of course interesting, in part because the hunchback of Victor Hugo’s novel was feared by the townsfolk as a sort of monster, but he finds sanctuary in the unlikely love of Esmeralda that is fulfilled only in death. Many stories are being played in the Virginia courtroom, not least Eugene O’Neill’s Long Day’s Journey into Night, but ultimately jurors will need to decide whose credibility stands up to scrutiny. Depp, at times charming and forthright but at others grandiloquent, is close to the end of his testimony. Heard will probably take the stand early next week. She has already proven herself to be an eloquent advocate for herself in depositions to the UK case. The central legal questions of defamation, of reputational fallout from Heard’s alleged libel, have at times seemed spare to the proceedings. “Even if the jury agrees he was defamed the jury can still decide she is protected under the Virginia law,” says Melville-Brown. “I keep waiting for one of them to get up and rush across the courtroom in true movie-style to say, ‘Sweetie, I’m so sorry,’ shower the other with kisses and say, ‘Let’s just walk away.’ Of course, it’s too late for that now. They are so entrenched in their respective positions in the court and with people around the world, they can’t get out of it now.”",Arts/Film,‘The divorce case that never was’: the first week in the Depp v Heard trial,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/23/johnny-depp-amber-heard-trial-recap-first-week
4/23/2022,"Crossing from road to wood is both easy and hard. Easy because the boundary is a single strand of barbed wire, hard because I’m stepping outside the law, again. The transgression pays off in minutes, though, as three wood-wraiths rise and drift ahead of me through the trees – brown hares, unhurried, seemingly unafraid. I pocket plastic as I go – cartridge cases, baler twine, a foil balloon – but can do nothing about feed sacks embedded in the soil or decades-old tree guards, brittle and disintegrating. When I emerge from the wood at the break of the slope, the landscape unrolls at my feet and I understand why the people who interred their dead in the long barrow at the top of the dale chose this place. The chalky turf is spangled with daisies, violets and celandines, and I see my first bee-fly of the year, my first orange tip. I doze off watching the flame-flicker of a brimstone dancing along a holloway no longer mapped – and wake to the black-hole stare of a stoat standing 10 feet away. When it finally moves, it is red as a fox, lithe as a ribbon. I follow downhill to a cluster of tumbledown hawthorns and find rushes teeming with little black spiders, and a gushing spring with the signature clarity of chalk water. I drink. It’s good, but the thirst that pulls me to places like this is for more than sweet water. It’s now 90 years since the mass trespass of Kinder Scout in the Peak District highlighted the burning need for a right to roam, and 22 years since the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 gaslit us into believing that the 8% of England to which we have free access is some kind of wondrous benevolence. Fine if you live near one. Elsewhere, public footpaths and bridleways only hint at what we’re missing as we cross private land, often hemmed in by wire, or barracked by signage that forbids us from being led by hares, or stoats, or butterflies or old ways. When I slipped under that wire into the full breadth of my homeland, something glowed in my animal brain. I’m both adrift and connected: fully out and wholly in.
