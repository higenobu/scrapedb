2/8/2022,"The first Kansas City-made electric vehicles just rolled off the line at Ford’s massive factory in the Northland. Detroit-based Ford Motor Co. announced Tuesday that its Kansas City plant began shipping the 2022 E-Transit van, the electric version of the popular Ford Transit cargo van. The E-Transit is the company’s second electric vehicle, following the brand’s Mustang Mach-E. Ford spent $100 million upgrading its Kansas City Assembly Plant in Claycomo and hired 150 new employees to build the electric van. “Our employees are very excited about being a part of history,” said Carlos Howell, manager of Ford’s Kansas City plant. Ford’s is the largest manufacturing center in the Kansas City area. The Claycomo plant employs 7,100 workers and produces more vehicles than any other Ford factory on the continent. In addition to the E-Transit, the local plant produces the gas-powered Transit van and the best-selling F-150 pickup. Employees are also building batteries for the electric van in Kansas City — making the plant Ford’s only factory assembling both batteries and electric vehicles in house. Officials in Detroit said demand is strong for the E-Transit van with 300 customers already ordering more than 10,000 vans. Though the vans are available for personal use, they are most often used for government or business fleets. Current customers include Walmart and the City of Orlando, Ford said. The vans have a range of 126 miles per charge with a suggested retail price of $43,295. “E-Transit is a testament to the fact that an electric commercial fleet is no longer a vision of tomorrow, but a productivity-boosting modern reality,” Kumar Galhotra, president of The Americas & International Markets Group for Ford, said in a news release. Like its rivals, Ford has spent billions to transition to electric vehicle production. The company said 40% of its vehicles will be electrified by 2030. Within the next two years, Ford officials say they expect to have the global capacity to build 600,000 electric vehicles per year. But Ford continues to struggle with supply chains that have yet to bounce back to prepandemic rigor. At the Kansas City plant, the F-150 line was idled this week and the Transit line was cut to one shift as the automaker struggles to secure the microchips needed to meet demand. “The global semiconductor shortage continues to affect Ford’s North American plants — along with automakers and other industries around the world,” said Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker. “Behind the scenes, we have teams working on how to maximize production, with a continued commitment to building every high-demand vehicle for our customers with the quality they expect.”",Business/Kansas City Star,Ford delivers its first all-electric vehicle made in Kansas City and demand is soaring,https://news.yahoo.com/ford-delivers-first-electric-vehicle-110000438.html
2/8/2022,"A judge slammed Powell last August for abuses of the legal system in her failed election-fraud cases. Powell asked a court to reverse the punishment against her in a Monday filing. She said the judge had portrayed her team as ""overwrought, dangerous lunatics."" Sidney Powell, the pro-Trump lawyer who was sanctioned over lawsuits that falsely claimed the 2020 election was rigged, has asked for her punishments to be reversed, saying the federal judge unfairly painted her team as ""overwrought, dangerous lunatics."" Powell and eight of her co-counsel were sanctioned last August over joint election-rigging claims that the judge called a ""historic and profound abuse"" of the legal system. The move came with a referral to disciplinary boards, with the potential for disbarment. Powell, who bombastically promised to ""release the Kraken"" through lawsuits alleging election fraud, had her claims dismissed in court multiple times. One central claim — which mobilized an unfounded conspiracy theory about voting-technology companies Smartmatic and Dominion — landed Powell with a $1.3 billion defamation suit. Powell counter-sued in September. In her motion to sanction, Linda V. Parker, a federal judge in Michigan, said Powell failed in her due diligence, used ""speculation, conjecture, and unwarranted suspicion"" in place of evidence-backed claims, and continued pursuing the cases long after they failed. Parker said the case wasn't about election integrity, but was ""about undermining the People's faith in our democracy and debasing the judicial process to do so."" Powell was initially part of former President Donald Trump's election-litigation team, but he later distanced himself from Powell. But Powell continues to pursue her allegations. In a 97-page appeal brief filed Monday in Michigan's Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and seen by Insider, she called the punishment ""intemperate"" and requested the case be re-assigned to a different judge. Parker did ""everything possible to make Appellants seem overwrought, dangerous lunatics,"" Powell claimed. In sanctioning Powell and her co-counsel, the order had ""the clear purpose of depriving them of their livelihoods,"" Powell said. In response to Parker's comment that she had relied on hearsay in her lawsuits, Powell said that cases are routinely processed ""all on nothing more than a single person's sworn say-so."" The Monday filing also drew on some high-flown literary references, quoting Shakespeare and Voltaire. ""The District Court has improved upon Voltaire's observation that '[t]yrants have always some slight shade of virtue; they support the laws before destroying them,'"" it said. ""It managed to shred the Constitution at the very same time it wrapped itself in the flag."" Referring to a plot to kill Henry VI, Powell also quoted: ""The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers."" ""Shakespeare knew that lawyers were the primary guardians of individual liberty in democratic England,"" she said.
