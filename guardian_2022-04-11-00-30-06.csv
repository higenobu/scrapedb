4/11/2022,"Soon after half-time the threat of total humiliation was hanging in the air for Harlequins. Driven forward by a dynamic display from Zach Mercer, the former Bath No 8 who scored twice before the break, Montpellier’s potent mixture of ruthless attack and bruising defence looked likely to overwhelm the Premiership champions. But following a resourceful second-half recovery when George Hammond, André Esterhuizen, Joe Marchant and Louis Lynagh all crossed for tries, Quins can carry plenty of hope back for the return match at the Stoop in six days’ time. A sun-kissed stadium in the south of France appeared to be the ideal setting for hot-stepping Quins to showcase their expansive offloading game with Fabien Galthié, the grand slam-winning France coach, watching on from the stands. But the first half turned into a harsh lesson for a side that had won their previous five Premiership matches. Tabai Matson, the Quins head coach, called Montpellier “the kickingest team in the French league” before the match. But the script in this clash of styles did not develop in the way he would have hoped. The Premiership side enjoyed no shortage of field position and possession in a scoreless first quarter but a succession of knock-ons, inaccurate passes and some indifferent tactical kicking made it an intensely frustrating opening from the visitors’ perspective. Marcus Smith had missed touch with a penalty in the first couple of minutes – which felt costly in such a significant game – but the No 10’s inaccuracy with the boot would bring a heavier punishment after Quins emerged from the opening 20 minutes with nothing despite their territorial domination. A speculative cross-kick by Smith was batted back by Kélian Galletier, with neither Lynagh nor Esterhuizen able to gather, and the ball popped up conveniently for the wing Gabriel N’Gandebe to race to the try-line unopposed. The momentum decisively switched in favour of the French Top 14 leaders and, when Mercer pounced for a sniping close-range score after half an hour, things took an even worse turn for Harlequins when Esterhuizen was shown a yellow card for what was deemed a deliberate knock-on in the preceding phase. After an attempted Danny Care kick rebounded off the considerable target of his teammate Joe Marler, Montpellier capitalised on the resulting gaps in the Harlequins defence and the front-rower Enzo Forletta popped up a lovely pass to an overlapping Mercer, who sped for the corner and touched down. The scoreboard read 26-0 at half-time and, when Titi Lamositele forced his way over the line straight after the break, Quins were truly staring down the barrel at 34-0. Unlikely recoveries have become their speciality, though, and Harlequins finally got on the board 10 minutes after half-time when Smith found his range with a perfect grubber kick for Hammond to run on to and touch down. Smith missed the tricky conversion but the five points were, at least, something to cling to. Smart thinking by Lynagh with a quick tap then allowed Esterhuizen to steam through a tackle and reach for the try-line and there was a smile on Smith’s face after he converted to bring it back to 34-12. When Lynagh burst through the Montpellier defensive ranks and fed Marchant, the centre had plenty of work to do, but found his way to the try-line with a jinking run and Smith, again, added the extras. The Montpellier manager Philippe Saint-André demanded a TMO review for a potential forward pass by Lynagh, but the officials were happy. The Springbok fly-half Handré Pollard came off the replacements’ bench to stroke over a couple of penalties but, when Lynagh streaked away to sprint under the posts and add Harlequins’ fourth try of the second half, the belief was visibly flooding back into the visiting players. With a 14-point deficit to overturn in the second leg, Matson’s side cannot afford to start so slowly a second time. But the comeback kings remain in this contest, and with much more than a puncher’s chance.",Sport/Sport,Zach Mercer drives Montpellier to victory despite Harlequins fightback,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/10/montpellier-harlequins-european-rugby-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report
4/11/2022,"Trading places in the middle of the Premier League may not ultimately mean much if Leicester City can reach the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League or Crystal Palace overcome Chelsea to reach the FA Cup final but this was another reminder of Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall quietly but assuredly making his mark as a proven Premier League talent. The playmaker made Ademola Lookman’s opener before swerving home his first Premier League goal as Leicester extended their sound home run to set them in good heart for Thursday’s win-or-bust second-leg tie away to PSV Eindhoven. But once again, the Leicester academy graduate, 23, impressed with his overall combination of stealth, touch and workrate in his breakthrough season at this level. Palace, conceding for the first time in five games and losing for the first time in eight, made a game of it in the second half when Wilfried Zaha scored on the rebound from his retaken penalty but Leicester the win that enabled them to claim ninth place off their visitors. With both teams’ sights set on upcoming cup adventures, it was perhaps not surprising that the first half was a slow-burning affair but Dewsbury-Hall made sure it caught fire with two crucial contributions in the six minutes before the break. It was his astute pass, into the space inside and ahead of Lookman, that encouraged the on-loan winger to move away from Nathaniel Clyne on to the ball, take a touch inside Joachim Andersen, and fire in his sixth Premier League goal of the season. On the front foot, James Justin had won the ball off Zaha just inside the Palace half to invite Youri Tielemans to feed Dewsbury-Hall in the build-up. The game had been about level, with Kasper Schmeichel saving well down to his left from Jean-Philippe Mateta’s shot early on, after Lookman had raced clear down the inside-left channel only to shoot wide. Dewsbury-Hall always looked one of the sparkier players on view, as only one of three surviving outfield starters from Thursday’s goalless draw with PSV, and his first Premier League goal just before half-time seemed to have settled the result. Tyrick Mitchell had been replaced with a knock and Marc Guéhi, Palace’s other recently capped England debutant, mis-controlled Justin’s forward pass to allow Patson Daka to make inroads down the right. The striker’s pull-back fell behind Dewsbury-Hall but the midfielder adapted, protected the ball from Cheikhou Kouayaté and turned to swerve in a fine shot into the top corner from the edge of the area. The game ignited midway through the second half when Schmeichel twice saved Zaha’s penalty only for Palace’s leading scorer to make it 2-1. Tielemans stuck out the leg that allowed Jordan Ayew to entice contact and win the spot-kick. The Leicester captain saved superbly down to his left to save Zaha’s first spot-kick only for VAR to espy that Caglar Soyuncu had encroached. When Zaha opted to fire his retake down the middle, Schmeichel guessed correctly to save again, only for the Ivory Coast forward to nod home his 11th league goal of the season on the rebound. The Leicester fans started the pantomime, booing Zaha’s every touch for his melodramatic reactions to decisions, but this only fired up the villain of the piece. Zaha showed brilliant control to shimmy his way down the left of the penalty area but from his short cross to the near post, Jeffrey Schlupp’s outrageous back-flick was blocked near the line by Mateta. But at least it felt like we had a proper game on our hands.",Sport/Football,Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall shines as Leicester get the better of Crystal Palace,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/10/leicester-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report
4/11/2022,"The White House has doubled down on its condemnation of Russian targeting of Ukrainian civilians as war crimes, describing recent events including Friday’s missile strike on a railway station as “cruel and criminal and evil” – but stopping short of classifying the brutal attacks as genocide. Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, took to the TV political shows on Sunday to decry Russia’s “systematic targeting of civilians, the grisly murder of innocent people, the brutality, the depravity” in Ukraine. He said recent atrocities “absolutely constitutes war crimes”. But speaking on CNN’s State of the Union, he declined to categorise the horrors of Russia’s war as “genocide”. Asked if recent attacks could be described as anything but genocide, Sullivan replied: “The label is less important than the fact that these acts are cruel and criminal and wrong and evil, and need to be responded to decisively.” Sullivan elaborated on his unwillingness to wield the term “genocide” in an interview with ABC’s This Week. He said the state department would gather evidence through its specialist unit and in time make a legal analysis according to the definition of genocide under international law. “We haven’t reached a determination on genocide,” he said. “That is a determination that we work through systematically.” Debate about how to frame Russia’s attacks on civilians – and with it how to proceed against Vladimir Putin and other top Russians in any future international prosecutions – have intensified after the missile strike on Kramatorsk railway station in eastern Ukraine. At least 50 people including five children were killed. Genocide was first codified in international law in 1948 through the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide adopted by the general assembly of the United Nations. Under the UN definition, genocide includes killing and otherwise inflicting destruction “in whole or in part” on “a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. The need to prove a conscious assault against an entire group of people sets the legal burden very high. By contrast, “war crimes” are defined under international law as a range of specific acts that are more easily prosecuted including “wilful killing”, torture or inhuman treatment, destruction of property and violation of the rights of prisoners of war. Investigations are under way to gather evidence of possible war crimes relating to the brutal Russian campaign. They include efforts in the Ukrainian town of Bucha where mass graves were found following the withdrawal of Russian troops. In the wake of the Bucha atrocities, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russia of genocide. But Biden has side-stepped the term while embracing another highly fraught legal concept under international law by accusing Putin personally of being a “war criminal”. In Congress, politicians of both main parties have been willing to embrace the idea that genocide is unfolding in Ukraine. The Democratic majority leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said last week: “When we murder wantonly innocent civilians because of who they are, whether it be their religion, race, or nationality, that is genocide. And Mr Putin is guilty of it.” On Sunday, Liz Cheney, a Republican member of Congress from Wyoming, also evoked genocide. “This is clearly genocide,” she told CNN, adding that Europe needed to understand that it was funding Putin’s “genocidal campaign” by buying Russian oil and gas.",News/US news,‘Criminal and evil’: White House doubles down on condemning Russian attacks ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/10/white-house-doubles-down-condemns-russian-attacks-war-crimes
4/11/2022,"If Melbourne is truly the sporting capital of the world, as locals like to brag, then it is only fitting that Formula One at Albert Park marked both the first and now latest phase of the pandemic. Two years ago, the Grand Prix’s chaotic cancellation hours before the first practice session unmistakably heralded a troubling new era. It was one of the first major international sporting events called off due to the emerging virus. On Sunday, more than 400,000 spectators tried to put the pandemic behind them. It would be premature to say that the domestic resumption of Formula One on Australian shores marks the end of Covid-19 (the 9,510 cases and one death in Victoria on the day of the race made that much clear) but with thronging crowds and exhilarating racing, it was at least momentarily possible to forget the turmoil of the past two years. At first glance the pandemic, like the past, was a foreign country: masks were few and far between, occasional hand sanitising stations stood unloved and social distancing was impossible. Yet Covid-19’s varied impact remained all too evident. The last time the world’s best graced Melbourne, they were met by a sea of yellow – fans supporting local favourite Daniel Ricciardo of French team Renault. Three years and a pandemic later, the dominant colour palate had subtly shifted to bright orange; the Australian driver having moved to McLaren and the Renault name no longer visible on the grid, with the teamrebranding as Alpine. The Australian Grand Prix has always been popular but tickets to watch the street circuit racing around Albert Park Lake sold out so quickly five new grandstands were built to increase capacity. That growth has been fuelled by Netflix’s ‘Drive to Survive’, a viral sensation during lockdown that made the technical sport more accessible to audiences. It has also helped attract a more diverse demographic - according to the race organisers, 40% of attendees this year were women, up from only one-quarter in the past. At a time of climate crisis, skyrocketing fuel prices and war in the Ukraine, 20 drivers and countless staff criss-crossing the globe to compete in petrol-guzzling speed machines seems incongruous. A small solar array at Albert Park was no doubt meant to highlight the sport’s commitment to climate action; instead, the tokenistic gesture only underscored the problem – Formula One’s annual carbon emissions are almost equivalent to a small nation (it has committed, rather optimistically, to net zero by 2030). The prominent sponsor signage for Aramco, the Saudi state oil company and the world’s largest corporate carbon emitter, was conspicuous. So too the sport’s complicity in human rights abuses. Drivers flew to Melbourne from Saudi Arabia, having contested a Grand Prix in Jeddah, capital of Saudi Arabia (the first Saudi GP, in 2021, came three years after the Saudi government had executed regime critic Jamal Khashoggi). This year the travelling circus will not visit Sochi for the Russian Grand Prix. Yet they have raced in Sochi every year since 2014, the same year Russia first invaded eastern Ukraine and annexed Crimea. Formula One’s shameless sportswashing efforts will instead take the sport back to Baku, Azerbaijan (ranked “not free” by Freedom House in their annual assessment of human rights and civil liberties). The season began in Bahrain, also deemed “not free”. But trackside at Albert Park, these concerns, along with the pandemic, were kept firmly out of mind. The top end of town convened in hospitality booths; dedicated fans with dollars to spend enjoyed sweeping grandstand views, and the rest staked out their own spot on a grassy hill or by the barricades. The guttural roar from the grandstand, as the drivers took part in their traditional pre-race exhibition lap, evoked simpler times, before “Covid-safe” had entered the lexicon. The race itself, won by Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, was thrilling. The high-octane spills, daring over-takes and chess-like tactical nous from the leading teams kept fans on the edge of their seats. For all its well-publicised flaws, for all the questions that linger around the viability of this male-dominated, carbon-intensive sport in the current era, few can deny the enthralling simplicity of Formula One. For the fans that packed into the South Melbourne venue to watch people drive really, really, really fast, the spectacle offered that sweet relief of escapism from a complicated reality. The pandemic is not over. Australia, and the world, are beset by challenges. But at least, after two long years, Formula One is back at Albert Park. That alone earned plenty of cheer on Sunday.",Sport/Sport,Australian Grand Prix allows Melbourne to set aside pandemic | Kieran Pender,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/10/australian-grand-prix-allows-melbourne-to-set-aside-pandemic
4/11/2022,"A key Republican on the House January 6 committee disputed a report which said the panel was split over whether to refer Donald Trump to the Department of Justice for criminal charges regarding his attempt to overturn the 2020 election, leading to the Capitol attack. “There’s not really a dispute on the committee,” the Wyoming representative Liz Cheney told CNN’s State of the Union. The New York Times said otherwise on Sunday, in a report headlined: “January 6 Panel Has Evidence for Criminal Referral of Trump, but Splits on Sending.” “The debate centers on whether making a referral – a largely symbolic act – would backfire by politically tainting the justice department’s expanding investigation into the January 6 assault and what led up to it,” the paper said. Citing “members and aides”, the Times said such sources were reluctant to support a referral because it would create the impression Democrats had asked the attorney general, Merrick Garland, to investigate Trump. Cheney said: “We have not made a decision about referrals on the committee … [but] it’s actually clear that what President Trump was dealing with, what a number of people around him were doing, that they knew it was awful. That they did it anyway.” She was speaking two days after CNN reported that the January 6 committee had obtained text messages in which Donald Trump Jr laid out election subversion tactics to Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, just two days after election day. A leading legal authority, Harvard professor Laurence Tribe, called the text a “smoking rifle” in establishing culpability in Donald Trump’s inner circle. Cheney cited a decision “issued by [federal] Judge [David] Carter a few weeks ago, where he concluded that it was more likely than not the president United States was engaged in criminal activity. “I think what we have seen is a massive and well-organised and well-planned effort that used multiple tools to try to overturn an election.” Cheney pointed to a guilty plea this week by a member of the far-right Proud Boys group, Charles Donohoe, to conspiring to attack the Capitol in a bid to stop Congress certifying Joe Biden’s victory. Such planning for events in Washington on 6 January, in part broadcast by Trump, was she said “the definition of an insurrection” and “absolutely chilling”. But Cheney would not be drawn on whether Trump should be referred for prosecution. She said: “The committee has … a tremendous amount of testimony and documents that I think very, very clearly demonstrate the extent of the planning and the organisation and the objective, and the objective was absolutely to try to … interfere with that official proceeding. And it’s absolutely clear that they knew what they were doing was wrong. They knew that it was unlawful.” Asked if there was a dispute on the committee, Cheney said there was not. “The committee is working in a really collaborative way to discuss these issues,” she said, adding: “We’ll continue to work together to do so. So I wouldn’t characterise there as being a dispute on the committee … and I’m confident that we will we will work to come to agreement on on all of the issues that we’re facing.” Cheney said Ivanka Trump’s testimony this week was “helpful, as has been the testimony of many hundreds of others who have appeared in front of the committee”. She said Trump aides Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino, referred to the DoJ for criminal contempt charges this week, had been “contemptuous” in refusing to testify. On Sunday, Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader who ejected Cheney from leadership over her involvement in the January 6 committee, issued a statement in support of the fight for democracy in Ukraine, in the face of the Russian invasion. Asked if she saw irony in such words from a man who sided with Trump over the Capitol attack, Cheney said: “What I would say is that what’s happening today in Ukraine is a reminder that democracy is fragile that democracy must be defended, and that each one of us in a position to do so has an obligation to do so. “Clearly, I think Leader McCarthy failed to do that, failed to put his oath to the constitution ahead of his own personal political gains.”",News/US news,Liz Cheney disputes report January 6 panel split over Trump criminal referral,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/10/liz-cheney-disputes-report-january-6-panel-split-trump-criminal-referral
4/11/2022,"George Galloway has threatened to sue Twitter after the social network labelled his account “Russian state-affiliated media”. The former MP, whose radio programme The Mother of All Talk Shows was broadcast on the Russian state-owned Sputnik service as recently as last week, says he will sue Twitter in the next seven days for defamation unless it rescinds the label. “I work for NO Russian media. I have 400,000 followers. I’m the leader of a British political party and spent nearly 30 years in the British parliament,” Galloway tweeted on Thursday. On Saturday Galloway’s lawyers filed notice in Ireland, warning Twitter that legal action would commence. “Twitter have badly miscalculated here in assigning this dreadfully harmful designation to Mr Galloway’s account,” said the solicitor Kevin Winters, of KRW Law. “Whatever strategic political or other reasons were in play in making this decision has only served to galvanise his fight to protect his good name and reputation. “His reasonable request to remove this offensive and damaging designation was ignored by Twitter. That’s simply unacceptable and inexcusable. Everyone knows George has robust political views and isn’t shy about expressing them but that doesn’t entitle Twitter or anyone else to demonise him in this way.” The notice argues that Galloway is “well-renowned for his independence of thought and opinion” and that “he has never accepted or been subject to any control, editing, interference or other restrictions upon his right to freedom of expression, to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas.” Twitter began labelling state-affiliated media in 2020, focusing initially on members of the UN security council – widely seen as an excuse to focus initially on Russian and Chinese state media. The policy immediately fell into controversy after the social network refused to label Voice of America, NPR or the BBC as such, arguing they were instead “state-financed media organisations with editorial independence”. Since the invasion of Ukraine, however, Twitter has started to apply the label to individuals associated with state media organisations. In February, Rachel Blevins, the host of a show on RT’s American channel, complained about receiving the tag, arguing that “I am an individual journalist who does not speak for Russia or Russian media”.

4/11/2022,"Under his own and several other names, including Jack Higgins, Harry Patterson had published 35 thrillers before, in his mid-40s, he hit the jackpot with The Eagle Has Landed (1975), an instant bestseller in the US, which is said to have sold more than 50m copies worldwide. Its success carried Higgins, who has died aged 92, into tax exile in Jersey, to a mansion overlooking St Aubin’s Bay, from where he was to write a popular thriller almost annually, his books guaranteed to find a place in every airport departure lounge in the world. With commercial popularity came the opprobrium of the literary critics: accusations of poor writing and the recycling of characters and plots from earlier books. The New York Times said that his bestseller Night of the Fox (1986) had “a plot which thickens to the point of congealing” and one critic described Thunder Point (1993) as “the finest book about drinking ever seen”, noting that references to drinking champagne outnumbered Scotch by 39 to 16. Patterson, who claimed to have been advised by his fellow author Alistair MacLean never to read reviews, rarely responded publicly to his critics and was quite open about his “recycling” when it became clear that On Dangerous Ground (1994) was a reworking of his earlier thriller Midnight Never Comes (1966). He certainly had no qualms about reusing names, with characters called Hugh Kelso, Harry Kelso, Max Kelso and even (twice) Martin Fallon, which then became one of his pen names, along with Hugh Marlowe, James Graham and, from 1968, Jack Higgins. The lack of “literary” recognition probably did hurt, as did the lukewarm reviews for the dozen or so films made from his books (he was a great film buff and from 1993 patron of the Jersey Film Society), plus the fact that he was never in contention, within the genre, for an award from the Crime Writers’ Association. Yet Patterson had an undeniable talent for spotting a popular story and was particularly quick off the mark with Exocet (1983), in the wake of the Falklands war, and Eye of the Storm (1992), following a mortar attack on John Major’s cabinet. Above all, he created a series of flawed heroes who were “good guys fighting for rotten causes”, notably Steiner, the “good German” in The Eagle Has Landed, and Liam Devlin and Sean Dillon, who both had backgrounds as IRA gunmen. This latter trait caused some concern among his editors at William Collins, the publisher he joined in 1971, as did his plot outline for The Eagle Has Landed. Patterson was told :“Nazis trying to kill Churchill? Where are your heroes?” The book came out in the US first, and was an instant hit, vindicating Patterson’s faith in the idea, and he later said: “It taught me one thing. Never, never listen to publishers.” The Eagle Has Landed established the Jack Higgins brand name worldwide and Patterson rarely used his other writing identities subsequently. In the year following publication, the book was filmed by the veteran action director John Sturges, with an all-star cast headed by Michael Caine, Robert Duvall, Donald Pleasence and Donald Sutherland. His next book, Storm Warning, also based on a second world war story, was a bestseller in 1976 and a film version was, reputedly, three weeks away from principle photography when cancelled. Patterson claimed he never knew the reason why, but “made a lot of money” out of the project nonetheless. Faced with a super-tax regime in the UK, Patterson fled into exile on Jersey. He always wrote longhand and his writing regime was said to start each evening in his favourite Italian restaurant in St Helier, then continue at home through the night before a glass of champagne and bacon-and-eggs breakfast at dawn, then bed. In 2003, the BBC reported his annual earnings at £2.8m. The story of Patterson’s life had a rags-to-riches ring to it which would not have been out of place in his fiction. Son of Henry Patterson and Rita Higgins Bell, he was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, but by the time he was two, his parents had split up and his mother moved to Belfast, where young Harry was brought up by his extended family. He attended Nettlefield primary school (as did the future footballer George Best some 20 years later) and claimed to have witnessed his first sectarian bombing at age six. He was ever thankful for the public libraries in Belfast and became an enthusiastic and fluent reader. When barely a teenager, Patterson was moved to wartime Leeds, where his mother remarried and worked as a waitress. He described himself as coming from “a poor background – very working class” but did apply himself enough to win a scholarship to Roundhay grammar school, a classic escape route to advancement which he failed to take. Beaten by the headteacher for throwing a snowball at the school clock, Patterson was told, “You’ll never amount to anything”, a judgment he was often to recall with pride, especially when awarded an honorary doctorate by Leeds Metropolitan University in 1995. H e served in the Household Cavalry for his national service (1947-50), attaining the rank of corporal and a posting to guard duty on the East German border. He also, thanks to army testing, discovered he had an IQ of 147 and the realisation spurred him to return to education once back in civilian life. Supporting himself with a variety of jobs including tram conductor and circus hand and eventually finding his way into teaching, he filled his spare time writing short stories, plays and radio scripts all of which failed to attract publishers or payment. In the 1950s, he was accepted into Beckett Park teacher training college in Leeds and also enrolled for a “distance learning” BSc degree course in sociology from the London School of Economics. He was one of the two external candidates to sit the final exams in Bradford in 1961, in which he was awarded a third, making him one of the earliest graduates in the new subject of sociology in Britain. Although married by now and starting a family, Patterson the qualified teacher seemed to enjoy the bohemian life of late 50s Leeds, befriending the young unknown actor Peter O’Toole and the recently published novelist John Braine. It was while Patterson was lecturing at Leeds Polytechnic that the literary agent Paul Scott finally found a publisher for his adventure thriller Sad Wind from the Sea, set in South China seas he had never seen, in 1959. Patterson was 29 and was paid an “awesome” £75 advance. Thrillers, crime novels and spy stories flowed effortlessly under a clutch of pen-names, though many had print-runs only large enough to supply the demand from public libraries, but his fan base was growing, albeit in the shadow of other thriller writers such as MacLean, Hammond Innes and Geoffrey Jenkins. “I had done all right,” Patterson was to say, “but I hadn’t done brilliantly.” The early 70s saw more attention to character in his writing, solid commercial success and even some glowing reviews. His war story A Game for Heroes, published in 1970 by Macmillan under the name James Graham, was set in the Channel Islands, a location he was to return to several times in fiction and, later, in life. It was well-enough received but it was his next two books back at Collins, as Jack Higgins, that were to make his name. The Savage Day (1972) and A Prayer for the Dying (1973) were centred on the troubles in Northern Ireland and publication coincided with the release in 1972 of a film of an earlier book, The Wrath of God, starring Robert Mitchum and Rita Hayworth. Whatever Harry Patterson thought, Jack Higgins was starting to do brilliantly. Despite initial scepticism from his British publisher, Patterson pressed ahead with his research for The Eagle Has Landed, the actual writing taking eight weeks. He is alleged to have threatened to take the book elsewhere when he discovered that Collins planned an initial hardback print run of “only” 8,000 copies. Published first in the US, it became (according to the author) a “publishing legend” and when it eventually appeared in Britain, it was to remain in the Top 10 bestseller lists for 36 weeks. Twenty years later, in a preface to one of the many reprint editions, Patterson wrote: “I may also say it changed the face of the war novel.” If he was never to achieve such heights for a single book again, Patterson had made the quantum leap into thriller superstardom and for the next 30 years the Jack Higgins brand name guaranteed commercial success, with total sales estimated at more than 250m copies. In an interview in 2014, he said: “I couldn’t see the point of writing books that didn’t make money.” In addition to four novels for young adults, co-authored with Justin Richards, Patterson wrote more than 70 novels, and on the cover of later books, his publisher labelled him: “The Legend Jack Higgins”. His last published novel, the 22nd to feature Sean Dillon, was The Midnight Bell (2017). In 2021, a compendium edition of his trilogy of police detective stories from the 60s was published as Graveyard to Hell. Patterson is survived by his second wife, Denise Palmer, a literary agent, whom he married in 1985; and by three daughters, Sarah, Ruth and Hannah, and a son, Sean, from his first marriage, to Amy Hewitt, which ended in divorce.

4/11/2022,"My friend George Dyer, who has died suddenly of a heart attack aged 67, was one of the UK’s most celebrated bespoke tailors. George set up his tiny tailoring shop, Threadneedle Man, on Walworth Road in south London in the mid-1990s. His talent for making exceptionally stylish suits, trousers and shirts helped him attract a loyal clientele that came to include many celebrities – Paul Weller, Martin Freeman, Ray Winstone, Suggs, Bob Hoskins and David Haye all wore suits George designed for them. Over the years George became something of a local hero: he appeared as a Listed Londoner on Robert Elms’ BBC London radio show and was interviewed by many magazines and local papers. George welcomed everyone into his shop, stating “all my clients are celebrities” when asked who his latest famous customer was. George was born in the small town of Chocolate Hole, in Saint Elizabeth parish, Jamaica. His father left for Britain while he was a baby and his mother followed a year later, George being raised by the extended family. Aged four he was sent for and arrived in London in 1959 to live with his parents in Peckham, south London. George’s favourite memory of his school days involved Johnny Nash and Bob Marley playing a free lunchtime concert at Peckham Manor school in March 1972. George then enjoyed kicking a football around with Marley. George shared his memory of this day in the 2020 BBC documentary When Bob Marley Came to Britain. On leaving school, George worked for Tesco and was then apprenticed as a tailor for Dombey & Sons, a chain of men’s outfitters. He worked in their Fleet Street outlet before being sent to Brixton and then Peckham. While aware that there was less and less work for bespoke tailors, George, confident in his skills as a cutter, determined to set up shop. He opened Threadneedle Man and, for the first three years, struggled to establish himself, taking on any kind of work. Once word got about that George knew how to make a classic “mod” suit, business began to boom and he was feted by many – in 2012 the painter Ed Gray created a large canvas of George at work alongside the writer Mark Baxter, his close friend. George possessed a wise, kind disposition and it was a pleasure to chat with him about all manner of subjects. He was a self-confessed workaholic who loved his trade and stated that he would continue making clothes as long as he could – and so he did. He is survived by his wife, Colline, daughter, Deniece, granddaughter, Isla, and three sisters, Shirley, Jeannette and Sherene.
