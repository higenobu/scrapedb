2/22/2022,"After a bruising two years in which the UK failed to prove its resilience to a pandemic, the government hopes to re-cast the nation as a scientific superpower: a country that has built on the lessons of the crisis to deliver better research, more precision healthcare, and a more streamlined pathway to new drugs and vaccines. But the government’s decision to substantially cut back on free Covid testing, as part of Boris Johnson’s “living with Covid” strategy, already threatens to undermine pioneering trials and coronavirus surveillance that are the envy of other nations. Together, they are crucial for understanding how drugs keep patients out of hospital, how immunity is holding up in vulnerable care homes and hospitals and how the epidemic is unfolding around us.  The Oxford University-backed Panoramic trial is one of the largest and most important clinical studies under way in the UK. More than 10,000 people have signed up to help researchers work out who will benefit most from Covid antivirals. While clinical trials showed that drugs such as molnupiravir can substantially reduce hospitalisations among vulnerable patients, most participants in the trials were unvaccinated. Panoramic aims to help researchers get a grip on how antivirals work in the UK population – where most people are vaccinated but many remain vulnerable because of old age or underlying health conditions. The results should underpin what doctors expect to become a central pillar of Covid care – providing antivirals to vulnerable people within days of symptoms coming on. Currently, 1.3 million people in the UK have been identified as eligible for antivirals, but the number may grow as the Panoramic results come in. That is if the trial goes ahead as planned. Health officials believe Panoramic needs free lateral flow tests for the over-50s and vulnerable adults under 50 until at least September, but free tests will end on 1 April with a possible exception for those aged 80 and over and people with compromised immune systems. If the trial needs more tests, the funding will have to be culled from other budgets. Another important project being put at risk is UCL’s Vivaldi trial. During the pandemic, Vivaldi has provided vital information on levels of infection and immunity among care home staff and residents, the latter among the most vulnerable in the country. The study links to lateral flow and PCR test results in the national testing programme to measure vaccine effectiveness and reinfection rates in residents and staff. With free testing dramatically scaled back, much of the intelligence that informs decisions on the need to re-vaccinate staff and residents, especially when new variants arise, will be lost. Similar concerns surround the UK Health Security Agency’s Siren study which draws on Covid test results to assess how swiftly tens of thousands of healthcare workers are reinfected with Covid as the epidemic unfolds – and so shed light on how quickly immunity is waning among frontline hospital staff. Amid concerns that it might be scrapped entirely, the Office for National Statistics Covid infection survey has seemingly been spared, but to what extent is unclear. The survey provides the most reliable weekly picture of the UK’s Covid epidemic. As free community tests are ended, the survey will become even more valuable, but it is also due to be scaled back, raising questions about how clear a picture health officials will have of the UK situation in the months ahead. The loss of most free testing in the community and the expected scaling back of the ONS survey could both have an impact on one area where the UK is truly world class. Swabs from both feed into the nation’s impressive genomic surveillance effort which has served as an early warning for new variants not only for the UK but for the world. The surveillance is only as good as the testing it taps into though. Without free tests, the next warning may not come so fast.",News/World news,Covid cost-cutting will put blinkers on our best Covid research ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/covid-cost-cutting-will-put-blinkers-on-our-best-covid-research
2/22/2022,"Frontline health workers in Solomon Islands have warned that its health system is on the brink of collapse as the country struggles to deal with a devastating outbreak of Covid-19. A senior doctor and two nurses at the National Referral Hospital (NRH) in the capital of Honiara have told of how there are no beds for Covid patients – leading to people dying on the floor of the wards – as well as a lack of facilities and staff shortages that have led to Covid-positive nurses being recalled to work and probationary nurses tending to critically ill patients solo, when they should be supervised by a more senior nurse.  “People are dying on the floor, the hospital is overcrowded … Sick people and dead bodies were all over,” a senior doctor at NRH said. “The morgue is full. It’s a sad experience. I have never seen this before.” Solomon Islands, a country of about 700,000 people in the South Pacific, had remained Covid-free throughout the pandemic, without a single case of the virus in 2020 and 2021. However, since Covid arrived in the country in mid-January, the country has recorded nearly 6,000 cases and around 70 deaths. The doctor, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the true number of deaths was likely to be much higher. “We have witnessed that there are deaths at home, not brought to hospital because of the fear that any dead body that comes to the hospital will be swabbed and once tested positive will not be allowed to be taken out by the relatives,” he said. “So some deaths are kept at home and it’s a sad and terrible thing to happen.” The doctor warned that healthcare facilities were struggling to cope, with the 56-bed Central field hospital fully occupied. He said that while tents had been prepared outside the hospital for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, they had no toilets, shower rooms or air-conditioning, which he alleged showed the government’s lack of preparation. “I would say that the government has failed this nation.” NRH has turned its orthopaedic ward into a “red zone” Covid ward, where critically ill patients needing oxygen are treated. But both he and a nurse in the hospital confirmed there were Covid patients across other wards in the hospitals. Staff were completely overwhelmed by the number of cases, the doctor said. “We do not have enough nurses to look after the Covid-19 patients, meaning there’s no proper observations and monitoring will take place on sick patients.” A registered nurse, who wished to remain anonymous, said staff were so overstretched that Covid-positive nurses were being called in to work. “In the past weeks, we have had no option but to recall those tested positive yet asymptomatic to come back to work as we can’t handle the increasing Covid-19 cases daily.” A newly-graduated probationary nurse who is working at NRH said junior nurses, who are meant to be supervised, were looking after critically ill patients by themselves. “We were newly graduated … we badly need supervision at all times. And this is a risky undertaking, especially when manpower is overstretched, which means we have to handle the cases ourselves.” The doctor warned that patients suffering from other illnesses and conditions, such as cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, and those requiring surgery were not getting treatment, monitoring or medication, potentially leading to more deaths. “There are lots of people with illnesses that did not follow up because of their fear of Covid-19,” the doctor said. “They are simply afraid of coming to the hospital … This results in some dying at home; some presented at the emergency and died.” Last week, the government issued a statement saying the rapid spread of Covid was beyond the testing capability of health authorities, contributing to under-reporting of actual case numbers since the outbreak began. The health minister, Dr Culwick Togamana, warned last week that the health system could not cater for all the people who tested positive or were showing symptoms of Covid. “That is why we have advised those with mild symptoms to strictly isolate at home and only moderate to severe cases [be] brought to health facilities for clinical management,” he said. At the end of 2021, Solomon Islands had a very low vaccination rate, with about 20% of adults fully vaccinated. Since the outbreak, vaccination sites that remained empty all of last year are now experiencing massive turnout from the public, and the health minister said there had been allegations of medical practitioners selling vaccines to people. The ministry of health did not respond to questions.",News/World news,‘People are dying on the floor’: healthcare workers tell of Covid devastation in Solomon Islands,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/people-are-dying-on-the-floor-healthcare-workers-tell-of-covid-devastation-in-solomon-islands
2/22/2022,"Jennifer Gonzales fears that Boris Johnson’s decision to lift all remaining Covid restrictions will end in “disaster”. The 56-old-year home educator says: “Covid is still here so we should carry on self-isolating if we get it. It is too soon to be changing that now.” Her view is typical of much of the nervousness in Horsham on Monday afternoon as the prime minister set out plans to lift restrictions. The West Sussex market town has the highest rate of Covid in England at 930 cases per 100,000 people.  Speaking in Horsham’s Swan Walk shopping mall, Gonzales says she is also worried about the end of free testing. “Even with free testing, a lot of people haven’t been using it and if you have to pay for it even fewer will. We will be mingling with people with no restrictions who may not know they’ve got it. I think that will be a disaster.” Lindsey, a 37-year-old care worker who did not want to give her surname, agrees. Sheltering at a bus stop from the tail end of Storm Franklin, she says: “I know they say that we should live with it. But we can still help prevent it, so self-isolation and free testing should continue.” She adds: “I know from my experience of working with vulnerable people that if you’ve got Covid you shouldn’t go into work.” She is also suspicious of Johnson’s motives for lifting restrictions now. She says: “Everything that happened with the wine and cheese parties and barbecues was ridiculous. When the government tell us one thing you should follow that. So I think he could be trying to get the public back on his side again.” Hetty Constable, 27, a hairdresser, also thinks Johnson’s plan is politically motivated. “He’s trying to get votes, but he’s a muppet and no one trusts him.” She adds: “I think you should still be made to stay at home if you have Covid. If I had it I wouldn’t come in to work. We’ve got to keep people safe.” Even some of those who back Johnson in this safe Conservative seat are uneasy about the plan. “It’s being done too quick,” says Darren Avey, a 56-year-old Tory voter who works at Horsham’s Horace Fuller lawn mower shop. He adds: “I’ve got a bad lung problem. My doctor said if you catch it you’d be gone because your lungs are so rotten and you won’t be able to fight it.” He reckons the move is financially motivated. “They’re doing it now because they can’t afford to keep the testing going. But they’ve got to keep people safe. Too many people are vulnerable.” But many in Horsham will be pleased to see the back of the restrictions, including David Tiller, 78, who spent five nights in hospital with Covid in September 2020. He says: “To me it was like flu. I ended up in hospital because I went down with pneumonia. Everybody seems to be panicking about it. It used to be that if you wore a mask when you went into a bank you’d be arrested; now you’ll be arrested if you don’t wear a mask.” David’s wife, Carol, 61, who works in Horsham Waitrose, says: “We can’t carry on with these restrictions, and people aren’t taking much notice of them anyway. I think it’s time people take their own responsibility and look after themselves, and not be told what to do.” Lyn Bishop, 73, a retired secretary, agrees. “The sooner we get back to normal, the better. I think it’s time really. I’m not nervous about it because I take my own precautions.” A 64-year-old retired officer worker who gave her name only as Stef, says she takes her inspiration from the monarch, saying: “The Queen has got it and she’s not panicking.” She adds: “The whole thing is different now: it is not 2020, we’ve got the vaccines, we’ve got the treatments. We shouldn’t say ‘herd immunity’ but we have built up resistance in the community.” “I’ve known umpteen people who have had it and only two who have been hospitalised and they are fine now. I’m sitting here with no mask and I don’t feel vulnerable.” ",News/World news,"‘It’s too soon to be changing’: the view from Horsham, England’s Covid capital",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/its-too-soon-to-be-changing-the-view-from-horsham-englands-covid-capital
2/22/2022,"Cabinet ministers were already waiting in No 10 on Monday morning when it became clear the sign-off for the prime minister’s much-anticipated end to Covid regulations was not going to be as perfunctory as they had imagined. A festering row between Rishi Sunak’s Treasury and Sajid Javid’s health department was responsible, first reported by the Guardian last week and still unresolved.  Few cabinet colleagues had much sympathy with Javid’s demands for extra cash to continue some Covid testing programmes beyond next month. “We are pushing through a hugely unpopular tax rise for his budget,” one cabinet minister said of the impending £12bn healthcare levy, funded by a national rise. “He’s got a budget that is triple the defence budget. No one can say he is being squeezed.” But privately some were horrified by the scramble to agree a deal between the Treasury and Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) just hours before the prime minister’s announcement. One Tory MP called it a “shambles” and said it returned doubts about the No 10 operation to the forefront of colleagues’ minds. “We thought this had been signed off days ago,” one grumbled. “Why is the prime minister calling a cabinet meeting when the details aren’t finished?” As word leaked out that ministers were being turned away from the delayed meeting, No 10 began by suggesting Boris Johnson’s briefing on Ukraine had overrun. But it soon became apparent that there was ongoing wrangling between Javid and Sunak over the future of testing for NHS staff in particular, and Covid surveillance programmes. It was an awkward few hours before the final agreement was done. The cabinet was hastily reconvened on Microsoft Teams, with ministers given less than 10 minutes’ notice of the 1.30pm meeting. Although his department has consistently denied requesting more cash, multiple sources said Javid was fighting to keep billions of pounds extra in funding to continue some free testing, including free lateral flow tests for symptomatic over-50s, but this was rejected by the Treasury. Over the previous week, sources said Javid had reduced his demands for additional funds but argued consistently for maintaining testing programmes designed to monitor new variants and surges. In the end, both sides claimed victory, with health sources saying Sunak had wanted to scrap the surveillance system completely. But one cabinet minister called the result a “total victory” for Sunak, saying the Treasury stuck to its original plans to cut Covid budgets by almost 90% and that Javid had to find the funds from his existing healthcare settlement. Johnson gave his backing to the chancellor’s refusal to agree further funds. Javid now faces the unenviable task of finding funding within his budget to continue surveillance programmes like the Office of National Statistics survey without hitting funds designated to clear the NHS backlog. A health source said Javid had always been arguing to be able to “reprioritise” within his budget, saying the health secretary understood the “fiscal case” to end most free testing. Yet as Johnson appeared before MPs to loud criticism from Labour and the SNP for the decision to end free Covid tests, several ministers remarked at how isolated Javid had been at cabinet for his push to retain some free testing. “Cabinet is pretty united on this direction,” one source said. Those Tory MPs who have doubts about whether the strategy is short-sighted have largely remained quiet. Greg Clark, the former cabinet minister, asked tentatively in the Commons how long it would take to restart mass testing should it be needed, but did not make the case to retain more of the programme. For the most part, as he announced the end of a testing regime which Johnson had once heralded as the envy of the world, Tory MPs cheered him on – arguably the most united the government benches had been in months.",News/World news,Tory row over testing casts shadow over PM’s Covid announcement,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/tory-row-over-testing-casts-shadow-over-pms-covid-announcement
2/22/2022,"Ofwat, the water regulator, has noticed that the industry it oversees in England and Wales has been in the news recently. So it has been. Discharges of raw sewage into rivers and coastal waters is a scandal happening in plain sight, and each set of data feels more shocking than the last. A highly critical report from MPs on the environmental audit committee in January made a strong case that Ofwat itself, plus the Environment Agency, should be more assertive. And here comes a regulatory response of a sort to the “current high level of scrutiny” of the sector: a letter from David Black, Ofwat’s interim chief executive, to the chairs of remuneration committees of the water firms suggesting, in a roundabout way, that bosses’ bonuses should be cut if the pollution record is poor.  The letter is the first of its kind and acts on one of the MPs’ suggestions, but one cannot call it strongly worded. Performance-related pay should show “a substantial link” to delivery for customers, including on “environmental commitments and obligations”, wrote Black, which is hardly laying down the law. There was a reminder to boards that they are allowed recognise shortfalls “whatever the initial framework for [pay] incentives”, which is just a statement of something the directors should know already: bonuses are always discretionary. One could say, generously, that Ofwat is merely at the preliminary stage of issuing a high-level warning and that tougher tactics could follow. The problem with that interpretation, though, is that Black didn’t specify what penalties would be imposed if his appeal for good behaviour on pay and bonuses is ignored, which must be a possibility. In recent press interviews, he has hinted at fines or changes to licence conditions, but the letter itself only said Ofwat would be “assessing your company’s approach” and didn’t describe possible sanctions. Maybe the pay-setters will come cleanly, as it were. But Ofwat, which is under scrutiny as much as the companies, would help itself if it laid out specific examples of unacceptable pay practices. Curbing boardroom bonuses for polluters is a good idea. But the policy requires the regulator to be stronger than it currently sounds. Never trust a bidder’s claim that its offer is “full and fair”. Kuwait’s National Aviation Services uttered the supposedly significant words when it was pitching 510p a share for the Edinburgh-based aviation services group John Menzies. Now it’s offering 608p, a mighty 19% improvement that exposes last week’s boasts as so much guff. Barring an (unlikely) arrival of a new bidder, 608p, or £559m, will be enough to win. Indeed, the Kuwaitis had already bought almost 20% of Menzies in the market last week, which undermined the ability of the target’s board to put up a fight. If your big shareholders aren’t with you, resistance is futile. A “willing to recommend” statement duly followed. For a few reasons, it feels a shame. First, because the Menzies chairman and chief executive, Philipp Joeinig, was making a decent case for continued independence, inviting investors to look beyond the pandemic’s effect on a share price that was 288p before the excitement started. Second, because Menzies is the larger company and has indeed fallen to an opportunistically timed bid, albeit one at a fat notional premium. Third, because we have learned, for the umpteenth time, that too many midtier companies just look basically cheap when viewed from abroad; the UK takeover door continues to be wide open.",News/Business,It’s time Ofwat hit the polluters where it hurts – in their bonuses | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/feb/21/time-ofwat-hit-water-polluters-where-hurts-bonuses-raw-sewage-discharges
2/22/2022,"Good morning. Sydney residents can expect more train troubles today, with limited services to resume after Monday’s shutdown as the dispute between the rail union and the NSW government continues. More strikes are “inevitable” this year if the NSW government refuses to scrap its 2.5% wages cap, say unions after rail chaos hit Sydney. A long-running industrial dispute between the Rail, Tram and Bus Union and NSW government saw staff across the state’s transport network “locked out” and train services ground to a halt on Monday. The transport union has accused the NSW government of playing politics with commuters, and the state government has ramped up its anti-union rhetoric, with the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, describing the action as a “coordinated attack by the Labor party and the union movement”. The NSW transport minister, David Elliott, liked it to “terrorist-like activity”, then accused RTBU of acting like “cowards”, spreading “bullshit” and “hijacking the city”.  A majority of Australian voters see China and the bilateral relationship as a complex issue to be managed (61%) rather than a threat to be confronted (26%), and more voters trust Labor than the Coalition to manage that complexity, the latest Guardian Essential poll suggests. Despite Scott Morrison last week repeatedly saying Labor is “weak” on security threats and declaring that only the Coalition would not “appease” Beijing, the opposition currently maintains a nine-point lead over the Coalition when people are asked which party they trust to manage the Australia-China relationship. Vladimir Putin will recognise the Russia-controlled territories in south-east Ukraine as independent states in a pivotal decision, scuttling an existing peace agreement and possibly triggering tough new sanctions from the west. According to the Kremlin, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron “expressed their disappointment with this development of the situation” but “indicated their readiness to continue contacts”. The German leader earlier warned that “such a step would be a gross contradiction of the Minsk agreement for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in east Ukraine and a unilateral breach of these deals from the Russian side.” France and Germany are both signatories of the Minsk agreement, a peace deal that will likely be abandoned as a result of the Russian decision. The Coalition government has pledged $804m for strategic and scientific programs in Antarctica and to ensure the increasingly contested region is “free from conflict”.

Six divvy vans turned up, cut the whole street off, and the whole pub evacuated in two minutes. We were running down the street with our amplifiers trying to get out of there. It was insane.” People’s experience of amputation differs. Jane Nicholls shares the story of having her leg “chopped off above the knee” after an unexplained blood clot in an artery in her lower leg. “I have a conical vestige of a leg. People call that my ‘stump’. Ugly word. I call it ‘my leg’. It is my leg,” she writes. “You dread an above-knee amputation. It changes your life. The knee has a crucial role in maintaining balance. If your leg is amputated below the knee, you can still do most of the things you used to do. I can’t run. Climbing steps can be terrifying. I can’t ride a bike. My life is about maintaining my balance. Not falling over.” There’s no denying that polyester clothing is an environmental hazard – it doesn’t biodegrade in landfill, virgin polyester is derived from fossil fuels, and it sheds plastic microfibres when it is washed and worn.

2/22/2022,"Britain believes there are figures within Russian military and security services who have “serious doubts” about invading Ukraine as the Kremlin continues to move more troops within 50km of the border. The claim, made on Monday, is understood to be based on western intelligence, although the concerns that exist are not expected to have any initial impact if President Vladimir Putin were to order an attack.  “There are elements within the military and Russian security services who harbour very serious doubts about the plan to invade and its effectiveness,” said one western official, who added they were “perfectly confident” about the assessment. However, no further evidence was offered to back up the statement, one of a number of intelligence-led warnings made by the US, UK and others in the past fortnight, all part of a wider political effort to try to demonstrate that the west has an understanding of Russia, its plans and intentions. Any invasion of Ukraine would be fraught with risk, in what would be the largest war in Europe since the second world war. It would pit 150,000 Russian troops, plus another 30,000 separatists, against a regular Ukrainian army of 145,000 plus tens of thousands of paramilitaries, many of whom have military experience. But Putin’s dominance of the Russian political and security scene has meant that any internal concerns about an invasion has been muted. Downing Street said on Monday that there still remained a “window for diplomacy” to resolve the crisis, but added that repeated complaints by the Kremlin that Ukraine had engaged in military provocations in the eastern Donbas region had suggested a plan to attack had already been decided upon. “Intelligence we are seeing suggests Russia intends to launch an invasion and President Putin’s plan has in effect already begun,” a No 10 spokesperson said. “We are seeing elements of the Russian playbook we would expect to see in those situations starting to play out in real time.” The western assessment is that Russian forces are now “poised to invade” if Putin gives the order. It is estimated two-thirds of Russia’s 110 battalions in the region have taken up positions within 50km of the border in both Russian and neighbouring Belarus, an increase from half a week ago. Half of those two-thirds are “tactically deployed” in temporary or makeshift locations even close to Ukraine, where they are awaiting further orders. Defence sources said they could stay in position “for a matter of days” before having to retreat to nearby staging areas, with better facilities. Defence secretary Ben Wallace said that the continued build up of Russian forces monitored by western intelligence did not suggest that the Kremlin was ready to ease tensions. “These are not the actions of a Russian government fulfilling its repeated declarations that it has no intention of invading Ukraine,” he told MPs. Updating MPs, the minister said there had been “a proliferation of false flag operations and propaganda stunts and Russian news outlets carrying fictitious allegations”. Russian officials said five “saboteurs” who tried to breach its border with Ukraine have been killed in the Rostov region were killed. Ukrainian armed vehicles were also destroyed, Russia said. Ukraine said its forces were not operating in the Rostov region and that such claims were “fake news”. Western officials added that Russia had access to a supply of Ukrainian military vehicles captured in 2014-15, when fighting between the two countries was at its most intense, which were available for “false flag” operations. British sources also sounded a note of caution about the efforts of France’s President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday to set up a summit meeting between US president Joe Biden and Putin, arguing that Ukraine had to be closely involved if there were to be direct negotiations between the two leaders. A UK government source said it was “too early” to say whether the summit was a good idea although opportunities for diplomacy were welcome. “We need to make sure Ukraine is played in and we have our set position on Ukraine’s sovereignty and their right to choose on things like Nato and that will remain,” they added.",News/World news,UK says ‘serious doubts’ exist within Russian military about invading Ukraine ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/uk-says-serious-doubts-exist-within-russian-military-about-invading-ukraine
2/22/2022,"Michael Gove has told MPs the taxpayer may have to pay more to make thousands of buildings safe after saying it is proving hard to get companies who made combustible materials to pay to fix the building safety crisis. In comments that struck a less bullish tone about his previously stated ambition to make the construction industry and developers pay, he conceded that the “government has to share some of that responsibility as well” and that the “taxpayer is the backstop”.  Gove had said he wanted freeholders, developers and product manufacturers to pay £4bn to help fix combustible cladding on all tower blocks above 11m, after the government already committed £5.1bn. But the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities told a Commons select committee: “The chancellor will probably shiver to hear me say it, but we have a responsibility here. But what we want to do is to make sure that with the taxpayer having already committed a significant amount, those who do have a direct stake in ownership do so.” He was speaking after last week’s promise to effectively ban developers and product manufacturers that do not help fix the cladding scandal from trading. He promised to limit leaseholders bills for non-cladding costs to no more than £15,000 in London and £10,000 elsewhere. But the Home Builders Federation industry group have told him they believe they are only responsible for a small fraction of the £4bn he is seeking and have complained they are being targeted “because, as UK-headquartered businesses, it is a simpler proposition than pursuing overseas developers, influential property sector interests and foreign product manufacturers”. Gove said to the MPs: “Some of the most egregious transgressors are companies based outside the UK so there are practical difficulties in pursuing them in the way that we would want to. Some of the things we have been trying to do with Kingspan, Arconic and these other companies is trying to demonstrate to them that they can’t evade these responsibilities.” Ireland-based Kingpan made some of the combustible insulation used on Grenfell and on scores of other buildings, while US-based Arconic made combustible cladding panels for Grenfell and other blocks. Gove was also unable to promise than public funds to build new social housing would not be raided. His appearance came as the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower disaster begins to examine the role of the government and affiliated organisations in setting rules that allowed combustible materials to be used. On Monday the inquiry heard from Debbie Smith, managing director of BRE Global, formerly the government’s Building Research Establishment, who said that in 2002 she told the government that after test fails, aluminium composite panels with a polyethylene core (used on Grenfell and at least 481 other high-rise residential buildings in England) should never be used on a tall building. Speaking just hours later Gove said: “It was clear that there was a collective failure to ensure that appropriate safety rules were followed and that information was shared in an appropriate way … Government has to share some of that responsibility.” Gove also said he will look at soaring insurance premiums, an issue raised by the broadcaster and journalist Jeremy Clarkson, who owns an affected flat, in his column in this weekend’s Sunday Times.",News/Society,"Taxpayer may have to contribute more to fix building safety crisis, Gove tells MPs",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/21/taxpayer-may-have-to-contribute-more-to-fix-building-safety-crisis-gove-tells-mps
2/22/2022,"Belarus is being annexed by Russia and its government will face the same “massive” sanctions as Moscow should there be an invasion of Ukraine from its territory, the EU’s foreign affairs chief has said. Speaking at the end of a tense 10-hour meeting of the bloc’s 27 foreign ministers, Josep Borrell said the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, was allowing his country to become a Russian satellite state.  The lack of transparency from Minsk over Russian troop deployments on Belarusian territory left the EU without any choice but to treat it as being complicit in the aggression against Ukraine, Borrell said. “I want to repeat once again that any further aggression against Ukraine will have a strong answer from the European Union,” he told reporters in Brussels. “But I want to add that this will also apply to Belarus should an attack be conducted from each territory with its involvement. “Belarus is being dragged into the crisis. It is losing its sovereignty. With a non-transparent deployment of Russian forces, Belarus is losing its nuclear neutrality. It is in the process of satellisation with respect to Russia.” Russian troops were due to leave Belarus on Sunday following their planned joint exercises with the Belarusian armed forces, but the country’s defence minister announced over the weekend that the 30,000 soldiers would remain indefinitely. Lithuania’s foreign affairs minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, said the Belarusian armed forces were no longer acting purely on orders coming from Minsk. He said: “Belarusian troops are receiving their commands now more and more from the Russian political decision-makers … and that means that there’s low, very low, levels of independence in the Belarusian army.” Borrell said ministers had been closely watching the televised Russian security council at which Vladimir Putin had discussed recognition of the independence of the eastern Ukrainian territories of Donetsk and Luhansk. There remain differences of opinion among the 27 member states on what level of sanctions will be imposed on Russia over the move. But Borrell said he would table the full prepared package of punitive measures at an extraordinary meeting for ministers to decide, and that Russia should be warned that there would be a “strong and united” response. He said: “I will certainly put on the table the sanctions package that has been prepared. We have a package prepared … This package has certain components that can be implemented with certain degrees depending on the level of aggression.” The developments in Moscow had radically changed the agenda of the EU ministers meeting, Borrell conceded, with hopes of a summit between Joe Biden and Putin dashed. “At 9am in the morning we were still thinking of holding high-level meetings between President Putin and President Biden, diplomatic activities,” he said. “At the end of the day, the scenario is completely different because we are no longer talking about summits.” The EU has threatened “severe costs and massive consequences” in the event of a further Russian incursion into Ukraine. The package has yet to be made public, but it would involve a block on exports of key electrical components on which Russia is reliant, potentially an import ban on Russian oil and gas, and the freezing of assets of individuals and companies affiliated to the government in Moscow.",News/World news,"Belarus should face same sanctions as Russia in event of invasion, says EU",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/ukraine-calls-for-urgent-eu-sanctions-on-russia-to-avert-invasion
2/22/2022,"Business leaders and unions have warned the government that scrapping free Covid tests in England and watering down sick pay will discourage workers from self-isolating and could damage the economy. Although welcoming Boris Johnson’s ambition to ease restrictions almost two years into the pandemic, company bosses said the prime minister’s newly unveiled “living with Covid” strategy came with major risks and could do more harm than good.  Claire Walker, co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said the changes inched companies closer to pre-pandemic conditions. “However, for many firms, this move will not be without its challenges and government must not pass public health decisions on to the business community, who are not public health experts.” The prime minister announced on Monday that people testing positive for Covid-19 will no longer legally have to isolate from this Thursday, while free testing would be removed from 1 April. Self-isolation support payments are to be jettisoned, while sick pay rules will revert to less generous pre-Covid arrangements which will mean workers are paid from day four of any absence through illness rather than day one. Johnson told the Commons: “Restrictions place a heavy toll on our economy, our society, our mental wellbeing and on the life chances of our children. And we do not need to pay that cost any longer.” However, business groups said the economic benefit of looser restrictions would be undermined by the end of free Covid tests and support for those who self-isolate. Matthew Fell, chief policy director at the Confederation of British Industry, said: “While free testing cannot continue forever, there is a balance to be struck between confidence-building and cost-cutting. Mass lateral flow testing has kept our economy open and firms continue to believe the economic benefits far outweigh the costs.” Frances O’Grady, Trades Union Congress general secretary, said low-income workers would suffer the most at a moment of mounting pressure on households. “Charging for Covid tests in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis is a crazy decision,” she said. “Ministers have been warned again and again by unions, businesses and public health experts not to scrap free Covid tests. But they have ignored these pleas.” The government said it would move away from deploying regulations and requirements in England and replace specific interventions for Covid-19 with public health measures and guidance, with further details expected later this week. However, the move raises the prospect of the government guiding workers who test positive for Covid-19 to self-isolate, while also dismantling the financial support and testing infrastructure to help them to do so. Christina McAnea, the general secretary of the union Unison, said ending free testing was a “foolish move” because people wouldn’t be able to afford to check their Covid status. “The government has taken leave of its senses. Ditching every last Covid safety rule while thousands are still catching the virus every day is irresponsible,” she added. Business leaders said that while infection rates had fallen from a recent peak there was still a risk of future outbreaks. Walker said: “Firms will only truly be able to ‘Live with Covid’ when they are confident that a plan is in place for future outbreaks.” The BCC boss added: “Uncertainty will put a brake on investment and the shadow of the pandemic could continue to loom over our economy for some time to come.” Hospitality leaders said removing restrictions could help pubs, clubs and bars, although cautioned that ongoing financial support was vital for building back from the health emergency. Michael Kill, the chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said extra measures were necessary at next month’s spring statement from the chancellor, Rishi Sunak. “This is a sector that has sacrificed more than just about any other part of the economy, and it seems right that continued support is commensurate with the scale of hit that we took during the pandemic.” Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of trade body UKHospitality, said many venues would still err on the side of caution despite the end of self-isolation rules. “We have a greater burden of care because we’re dealing with situations where, if hygiene is lax, there are big ramifications,” she said. “Just because something isn’t there in law, doesn’t mean it won’t be there as part of normal mitigation and risk assessments.” Unions responded with fury to the news that statutory sick pay will revert to pre-Covid rules. The TUC has warned that the UK has the lowest statutory sick pay in real-terms for almost two decades and is the least generous in Europe. Under the rules, employees are paid £96.35 a week by their employer if they are too ill to work. Dan Shears, national health and safety director at the GMB trade union, said: “Today’s nonsensical announcement guarantees workers will attend the workplace with Covid. “This will prolong the pandemic with more outbreaks. Asking people to exercise responsibility whilst taking away a key workplace provision for them to do that just shows how incompetent this government is.” Additional reporting: Rob Davies and Sarah Butler",News/World news,"‘Living with Covid’ strategy could do more harm than good, say businesses and unions",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/living-with-covid-strategy-could-do-more-harm-than-good-say-businesses-and-unions
2/22/2022,"Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, has announced that he is recognising two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent. Here is a look at the implications for the wider crisis, in which the US says Russia may be poised to invade Ukraine with a force of up to 190,000 troops that it has amassed near its neighbour’s borders.  Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions – collectively known as Donbas – broke away from Ukrainian government control in 2014 and proclaimed themselves independent “people’s republics”, until now unrecognised. Since then, Ukraine says about 15,000 people have been killed in fighting. Russia denies being a party to the conflict, but has backed the separatists in numerous ways, including through covert military support, financial aid, supplies of Covid-19 vaccines and the issue of at least 800,000 Russian passports to residents. Moscow has always denied planning to invade Ukraine. For the first time, Russia is saying it does not regard Donbas as part of Ukraine. That could pave the way for Moscow to send military forces into the separatist regions openly, using the argument that it is intervening as an ally to protect them against Ukraine. Alexander Borodai, a Russian parliament member and former Donetsk political leader, said last month that the separatists would then look to Russia to help them wrest control of parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions still under the control of Ukrainian forces. If that happened, it could lead to open military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Russian recognition effectively kills off the 2014-15 Minsk peace agreements that, although still unimplemented, have until now been seen by all sides, including Moscow, as the best chance for a solution. The accords call for a large degree of autonomy for the two regions inside Ukraine. Western governments have been lining up for months to warn Moscow that any movement of military forces across the Ukrainian border would draw a strong response, including stringent financial sanctions. Antony Blinken said last week that recognition “would further undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, constitute a gross violation of international law, [and] call into further question Russia’s stated commitment to continue to engage in diplomacy to achieve a peaceful resolution of this crisis”. The US secretary of state said it would necessitate a “swift and firm” response from the US and its allies. Yes – it recognised the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two Georgian breakaway regions, after fighting a short war with Georgia in 2008. It has provided them with extensive budget support, extended Russian citizenship to their populations and stationed thousands of troops there. In the case of Georgia, Russia used recognition of the breakaway regions to justify an open-ended military presence in a neighbouring former Soviet republic in an attempt to indefinitely thwart Georgia’s Nato aspirations by denying it full control of its own territory. The same considerations would apply to Ukraine. On the downside, Moscow faces sanctions and international condemnation for abandoning the Minsk process after long maintaining that it was committed to it. It will also be saddled indefinitely with responsibility for two territories ravaged by eight years of war and in need of massive economic support.",News/World news,What does Russian recognition of breakaway Ukraine regions mean?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/what-would-russian-recognition-of-breakaway-ukraine-regions-mean
