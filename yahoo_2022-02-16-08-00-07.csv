2/16/2022,"What does once removed mean, really? If TikTok is any indication, that very specific question is one of the defining mysteries of our time. The term gets thrown around all the time at family reunions, or when discussing genealogy and family trees. That said, it’s clear a lot of us never actually knew what it means. Thankfully, Kevin Silberman is here to clear things up. Silberman is a high school social studies teacher and TikToker, who shares quick explanatory videos on his page (@silb0017). In a recent video, which drew over 11 million views, Silberman unraveled the confusion around “once removed” cousins. Silberman’s video begins with the teacher in front of his whiteboard, a simple family tree drawn behind him. Then, he breaks down the difference between first cousins, second cousins and cousins once removed. “I had a lot of questions on this TikTok,” Silberman says, referring to his earlier, slightly more confusing cousin breakdown. As Silberman explains, the child of your aunt or uncle is your first cousin. Meanwhile, the child of that first cousin is your cousin once removed. The key, he explains, is that “removed” really means “down a generation.” Get Jordyn Woods's makeup look with these products: “If my first cousin once removed had a son,” Silberman explains. “He would be my first cousin twice removed.” So what about second and third cousins? Those relationships, Silberman explains, never exist outside of the same generation. For example, your child and the child of your first cousin would be second cousins. TikTokers were largely blown away by the explanation. “Why did I think ‘removed’ means they got divorced?” a popular comment asked. “I’m almost 39 years old, and this is the first time I’ve heard someone explain the ‘once removed’ thing,” another added. “I’m just gonna call them all my cousins,” another joked.

2/16/2022,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Starbucks is battling its second bout of public fury in China in less than three months, after an incident described by the U.S. coffee giant as a ""misunderstanding"" at one of its stores sparked criticism from online users and state media. The company came under scrutiny on Monday after a user on Weibo said that a number of police officers had been eating outside a Starbucks store in the southwestern city of Chongqing before they were told by staff to move away. The user's description of the incident quickly went viral on the Twitter-like platform, prompting the ruling Communist party's mouthpiece People's Daily newspaper to issue a commentary, in which it called Starbucks ""arrogant"". Chinese consumers and media have become more aggressive about protecting customer rights and monitoring the behaviour of big brands, especially from overseas. In December, Starbucks apologised and carried out inspections and staff training across all its roughly 5,400 stores in China after a state-backed newspaper said two of its outlets used expired ingredients. Starbucks apologized on its Weibo account late on Monday for ""inappropriate communications,"" saying the whole thing was a misunderstanding. But it said staff had never chased away policemen or tried to file complaints against them. It continued to face criticism online on Tuesday, with a few small companies announcing on Douyin, the Chinese equivalent of TikTok, that they would ""boycott"" Starbucks by forbidding employees from arranging meetings in or buying drinks from the shops of the coffee chain. However, Hu Xijin, a prolific commentator in China who is the former editor-in-chief of the Global Times newspaper, urged his Weibo users to see the Starbucks Chongqing incident as an accident and not more, adding that Starbucks's status as a foreign brand should not subject it to more criticism. ""China is a country that is open to the world,"" he said. ""To label a mistake as arrogance is not conducive to the bigger environment of opening-up.""

The true origin of life has always been one of the greatest unknowns that we as humans have sought to learn about. From the creation of the world in the Bible to the belief that biomolecules came to Earth on the backs of asteroids or comets billions of years ago, we’ve seen several answers over the years. Until now, though, many believed that the basic building blocks of life, called peptides, required water to form. This ruled out the possibility that these building blocks could come from space, right? Well, new research has turned that belief on its head. And now some say we’ll need to look to the stars if we truly want to find the true origin of life.

Brand new AirPods Pro with MagSafe are so cheap it might be a mistake Amazon's #1 best-selling bed pillows with 117,000 5-star reviews have a rare discount! No matter what territory your beliefs fall under for the origin of life, the data found by Dr. Serge Krasnokutski, a physicist at the Laboratory Astrophysics and Cluster Physics Group of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy at the University of Jena, and his team is intriguing. Krasnokutski says the formation of peptides normally requires the addition of water in the first step. The second step involves the removal of the water to complete the formation. This creates what scientists call an amino acid glycine, a key figure in the hunt for the origin of life. Krasnokutski and his team wanted to see if they could recreate peptides in space. However, part of the mystery lies in the fact that space is a vacuum. That means there’s no oxygen to help create the water needed for the process. With this new research, Krasnokutski and his team proved it is possible. Additionally, they proved that the previous convention isn’t the only way these peptides form. “Instead of taking the chemical detour in which amino acids are formed, we wanted to find out whether amino ketene molecules could not be formed instead and combine directly to form peptides,” Krasnokutski explained in a statement. “And we did this under the conditions that prevail in cosmic molecular clouds, that is to say on dust particles in a vacuum, where the corresponding chemicals are present in abundance: carbon, ammonia and carbon monoxide.” Peptides play an important role in the hunt for the origin of life. As such, knowing as much about their formation as we can is important. To prove the viability of life’s origin in space, the team aimed to create peptides in a space-like vacuum. The team used substrates as a stand-in for cosmic dust particles. Next, the team brought the particles together with carbon, ammonia, and carbon monoxide. All of which are components found on cosmic dust. The team combined them in air pressure at one quadrillionth of the normal air pressure and minus 263 degrees Celsius. The result was a polyglycine similar to peptides we’ve already discovered. It’s a notable bit of information in the search for the origin of life. Of course, it doesn’t tell us for sure whether the original peptides came from space. It does at least give us a reason to start looking beyond our own planet for the true origin of life. Even with that knowledge, though, the answer to that question is still a long way off.

2/16/2022,"A viral post calling for Black women to come to Kanye West’s rescue once again raises questions about why we’re always expected to save everyone but ourselves. This past weekend was another a busy one for Kanye West. In his ongoing war against soon-to-be-ex-wife Kim Kardashian-West and her new beau Pete Davidson, he took to Instagram to post a barrage of insults, all reportedly in an effort to expose the media narrative being built against him and “fight” for his family. Though I’ve intentionally made it a point not to follow his antics, when Kanye does something—anything—he trends and tuning in often becomes almost unavoidable. When I saw him trending this time, I assumed it was Kanye being Kanye. I wasn’t wrong. It wasn’t until one of my Sorors dropped into our group chat with an Instagram post positing Kanye wouldn’t know peace until he’s in a relationship with a Black woman that I felt some kind of way. While conversations about Kanye’s wellness and self-acknowledged bipolar diagnosis have long lingered in response to incidents of him publicly acting out, so have questions of who’s around to hold him accountable. As someone who has experienced deep loss, works diligently to maintain my own mental health and has some behaviors and traits that only get better when I put that work in, I know how complicated conversations around Kanye are. Everything isn’t reducible to his mental health nor should it be. At the same time, mismanagement of mental health isn’t good for anyone and can jeopardize everything. That’s why, in response to both the initial post and the resulting social media conversations, I chimed in to say a Black woman isn’t what Kanye needs, it’s therapeutic support to be his best self and a personal commitment to want to be. While many Black women are licensed therapists and counselors, that is not and should not be the default of every Black woman. And, though we make great accountability partners, Black women shouldn’t be expected to hold everyone accountable—especially someone who hasn’t asked for it and makes relationship choices as though he’d rather do without it. But to be honest, while Kanye is the most current context for this sentiment, the idea that sisters are the cure-all for whatever ails you isn’t a new one. Black women have long been expected to save America from total destruction, love Black men into the best versions of themselves, raise accomplished and respectful children, maintain a home without blemish or flaw, and secure a level of social status and respect their husbands and children can be proud of all while drinking eight glasses of water daily, volunteering at the church, being the backbone of their extended families and maintaining desirable bodies and clear skin. Any time she deviates from any of these simple tasks, she has set Black America back 100 years. And the moment she calls out the foolishness, she is the problem. In the context of Kanye, whether it was Black women telling me I’m just not the kind of Black woman who can help a Black man reach his full potential or Black men calling me fat, ugly, undesirable and not a woman brothers want anyway, my social media was filled with people telling me I had no idea what I was talking about. Many even took the time to remind me of Kanye’s wealth, one going so far as to say I was trashing a billionaire when I was probably sitting with a checking account in overdrafts. This type of response isn’t new and doesn’t just happen to me. It’s part of an ugly, violent and persistent trend of denigrating Black women who advocate for themselves and other Black women. These people virtually spit in the faces of women who look like their mothers, grandmothers, sisters, cousins and aunties—women who look like them—and don’t think twice about it. Instead, they painstakingly take the time to single out Black women like me as what’s wrong with our community. Question: How are Black women like me the problem and the solution? How is it that Black women are expected to come to the rescue of those who “need” us but when Black women push back against that trope, we’re told Black men don’t want us anyway? And why are we often told we’re only tolerated because Black men are—as one commenter claimed—“stuck” with us if they want to have Black children? I can’t be what you need and the reason you need it. And it will never be wrong to insist that, as Black women work to be whole and well themselves, they deserve partners who can extend the same in reciprocity. Here are a few things that are true and two things I know for certain: There will be another instance (or countless ones) when the call for Black women to come in and clean up a mess they didn’t create will be made. When that happens, Black women who refuse to pick up that mop and bucket will continue to be targets of vicious attacks across social and digital platforms. It’s well past time we actually care enough to stop both from happening. For some Black men, that will require that they take a moment to actually see us. Not just see themselves in us but see us as we are—human beings maneuvering similar weights and challenges in a world of anti-Blackness. It will require deep and honest reflection about harm done and necessitate that men hold each other accountable when they see another Black man engaging in that kind of harm. It also requires Black women to take residence in the sacred space of saying “no” to notions that deny our humanity and refuse us the right to real self-care. It means honoring that we are more than the world’s clean-up woman. It means remembering and reminding each other: We have always been more.
