3/23/2022,"On Jimmy Kimmel, the host started by expressing concern over LA’s loosening of Covid restrictions. “We’re keeping the Covid and we’re getting rid of the safety,” he joked. He then moved on to “a full day of nonsense” in the US Senate as the hearings for Ketanji Brown Jackson continued. The judge is Joe Biden’s supreme court nominee, and has been on the receiving end of barely disguised racist attacks from Republicans. Her opening speech was well-received on both sides, but Marsha Blackburn and Josh Hawley have taken issue. “You lost us at Ketanji,” Kimmel said, in reference to their response. Bizarre questioning has focused on padeophilia and child sex abuse images, inviting comparisons to QAnon theories. Kimmel criticised Republicans for “trying to smear a mother of two daughters and who is quite clearly not pro-child porn”. Despite the “gratuitous attacks”, Kimmel complimented Jackson’s “grace under pressure” before remarking: “It’s funny listening to the same people who let the president try to overthrow the government call anyone soft on crime.” Ted Cruz was also fixated on Jackson’s involvement with critical race theory, despite it not having any relevance to her work thus far. It led to the official Republican Twitter account tweeting a picture of the judge with her initials erased and replaced with CRT. “I think your dog whistle’s busted guys, everyone can hear it now,” Kimmel said. He moved on to Tucker Carlson’s strange interview with Donald Trump favourite Kid Rock, showing a montage of the Fox News host “laughing like a seal with a mouthful of sardine penises”. Eric Trump also appeared on Sean Hannity’s show, to criticise Biden for taking a bike ride in the middle of the day, something that elevated him up the “hypocrite hall of fame”, given that his father played golf an estimated 250 times during his presidency. This week has also led to Stormy Daniels being ordered to pay Trump’s legal fees. “First you have to have sex with Donald Trump, then you have to pay him for it,” Kimmel said.",Arts/Culture,"Jimmy Kimmel to Republicans: ‘I think your dog whistle’s busted, guys’",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/23/jimmy-kimmel-republicans-dog-whistle-late-night-tv
3/23/2022,"Britain’s proposed cuts to foreign aid on healthcare, conflict prevention and the climate crisis could cost lives, more than 200 NGOs warned in an open letter to the foreign secretary. A government review of the international development strategy ordered by Liz Truss is due soon but the reported restructuring of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has raised concerns about development being abandoned. “It would be shortsighted to drop critical issues like global health, climate change and conflict prevention from the forthcoming international development strategy. It would also cost lives,” said the letter. “This move will undermine the UK’s ability to play our part globally in tackling urgent challenges, increasing security, and eradicating poverty. Supporting countries in times of crisis is critically important, but so too is investing in the development assistance that prevents these crises.” Responding to the Ukraine crisis should not mean funding is diverted from elsewhere, the letter read. The war highlighted the importance of a development strategy that is “poverty-focused, evidence and rights-based, and accountable to the British public and communities it is meant to serve”. On Tuesday, the Telegraph reported that the review was supposed to be published next Monday but had been delayed to mid-April after Truss ordered it to be redrawn to focus more on her interests. The controversial restructuring of the department comes less than two years after the merger of the Department for International Development (DfID) with the Foreign Office in 2020. At the time, then foreign secretary Dominic Raab said aid would be “the beating heart” of international policy. Last week, the aid news website Devex reported that the FCDO director general for Africa, Moazzam Malik, who previously worked for DfID, had resigned amid the restructuring. Stephanie Draper, the CEO of Bond, the network for British NGOs, said Malik’s resignation was a blow to the FCDO. “The FCDO urgently needs a dedicated international development minister in the cabinet to drive the UK’s development priorities. The FCDO needs real senior level expertise to help prevent future crises, rather than constantly trying to deal with the aftermath,” said Draper. This week, parliament’s international development committee was told by NGOs that the government’s aid cuts during the pandemic had hit women and girls worst. “It’s very clear there’s been a lack of transparency, a lack of accountability and we still don’t know where those cuts have landed,” said the committee’s chair, Sarah Champion, at the end of the session. “I really hope the rumours of pulling out of conflict funding, pulling out of climate adaptation funding, and pulling out of much of the healthcare funding are just that – rumours – because it will be devastating if true.”",News/Global development,"Cuts to UK overseas aid ‘could cost lives’, Liz Truss warned",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/23/cuts-to-uk-overseas-aid-could-cost-lives-liz-truss-warned
3/23/2022,"Russian forces have been accused of effectively taking hostage the people of the besieged Ukrainian city of Chernihiv as desperate local officials imposed drinking water rationing on their trapped civilians. About 150,000 people are stuck in the northern city with little hope of aid after Russia cut them off from the capital, Kyiv, 100 miles south, by bombing a road bridge across the Desna River. Chernihiv, which has been the focus of intense fighting, had already been without power for days. Officials said they were now running out of drinkable water in a grim forewarning of a major humanitarian disaster to match that of the flattened port of Mariupol in the south-east of the country, from where 100,000 people are struggling to flee. “The number of tanks for drinking water is limited,” Chernihiv officials said in a warning to civilians on Wednesday. “Due to this, in order to protect the population of the city, starting from 24.03.2022, restrictions are imposed on the distribution of drinking water. Water will be poured in the amount of 10 litres per person.” A date for a second supply of water was not provided. Lyudmila Denisova, Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, claimed that the population was being held hostage, with the Ukrainian government fearful that the Kremlin is seeking to push its “maximalist” demands in the current peace negotiations with Kyiv by ratcheting up the barbaric targeting of civilians. Denisova said: “Today Chernihiv remains completely cut off from the capital. The occupiers bombed the bridge across the River Desna, through which transported humanitarian aid to the city and evacuated civilians. “The city has no electricity, water, heat and almost no gas, infrastructure is destroyed. According to local residents, the occupiers are compiling lists of civilians for the ‘evacuation’ to Lgov [in the Kursk region of Russia]. The racists, cutting off Chernihiv from the capital, turned its inhabitants into hostages.” Chernihiv’s mayor, Vladyslav Atroshenko, said Russia was targeting its fire at the city’s hospitals in an echo of the attritional warfare being conducted elsewhere. He said: “Is a hospital a military infrastructure facility too? It is important to understand what methods are used by Russia when conducting hostilities in Chernihiv. “Their tactic is to intentionally destroy civilians and infrastructure facilities. It has nothing to do with the targeted fire on military infrastructure facilities.” Atroshenko told the Ukrainian news website Censor.net there were now 40 funerals per day in Chernihiv, up from eight, as a result of Russia’s indiscriminate shelling. He said: “We have two base hospitals in the city with about 200 wounded in each of them. We bury about 40 people per day. Prior to the war, we buried an average of eight people per day. According to my estimates, about 50% of local residents left the city. Another 50% are staying, but, unfortunately, many people among those who are staying cannot take care of themselves,” Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the head of the Ukrainian President’s Office, told Channel 24 that “the enemy [had begun] to apply to the city about the same tactics as in Mariupol”. Arestovych added, however, that unlike in Mariupol there remained ways to supply humanitarian aid to the city. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said agreement had been reached to try to evacuate civilians trapped in Ukrainian towns and cities through nine “humanitarian corridors” on Wednesday, but that no such agreement had been reached to establish a safe corridor from the heart of Mariupol. The name of an 11-year-old gymnast was added to the growing death toll in Mariupol on Wednesday. Kateryna Dyachenko was said by her coach, Anastasia Meshchanenkova, to have died as result of the collapse of a house after a direct hit by Russian artillery. In a video address late on Tuesday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy had made renewed his calls for Russia to allow safe humanitarian corridors, saying civilians faced “inhumane conditions. In a total siege. Without food, water, medication, under constant shelling and under constant bombing.” Satellite images of Mariupol released by Maxar on Tuesday showed a charred landscape, with several buildings ablaze and smoke billowing from the city. The Pentagon has said Russia was now pummelling Mariupol using artillery, long-range missiles and naval ships deployed in the nearby Sea of Azov. Meanwhile, there are growing concerns in western Ukraine that Belarus is preparing to send its own troops into the country. On Wednesday, Alexander Lukashenko’s government told some Ukrainian diplomats to leave the country.

3/23/2022,"A Cambridge college has been refused its application to remove a memorial to its 17th-century benefactor Tobias Rustat from the college chapel because of his links to the slave trade. Jesus College argued that the memorial, in a prominent position on the west wall of the Grade I-listed chapel, should be moved to another site in the college because its presence was having a negative impact on the mission and ministry of the church. It is accepted that Rustat, a former courtier to King Charles II and one of the college’s most significant benefactors, was involved with the Royal Adventurers and the Royal African Company that trafficked and traded enslaved Africans. But a church court found that widespread opposition to the memorial was based on “a false narrative” about the scale of the financial rewards Rustat gained from slavery, and ordered that the memorial should remain in the chapel, which is the oldest in Cambridge. A consistory court – an ecclesiastical body dealing with matters of law relating to the church – held a hearing last month on the application by Jesus College to the diocese of Ely to remove the plaque. Responding to the judgment – made by the deputy chancellor of the diocese of Ely, David Hodge QC – a spokesperson for Jesus College said: “We are deeply disappointed and shocked by the decision.” The college will now consider whether to seek leave to appeal. In the meantime, the ruling will be examined closely by the Church of England, which has countless other statues and memorials in church buildings dedicated to prominent historical figures with links to the slave trade. In February the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, came out in support of the college’s attempt to move the plaque when, speaking at the C of Es General Synod, he asked: “Why is it so much agony to remove a memorial to slavery?” He said the church needed to change its practices, pointing out that Jesus College had as its master a black woman, Sonita Alleyne, who had to look at a memorial to a man who financed slavery “every time she sits in her stall”. Dismissing the college’s petition, Hodge said the removal of the Rustat memorial would cause “considerable or notable harm to the significance of the chapel as a building of special architectural or historic interest”. He said no one disputed that slavery and the slave trade were “evil, utterly abhorrent, and repugnant to all right-thinking people,” but opposition to the memorial was the result of a false narrative that Rustat had amassed much of his wealth from the slave trade, which he then used to benefit the college. The true position, Hodge said, was that Rustat’s investments in the Royal Adventurers brought him no financial returns at all, and he realised his investments in the Royal African Company only in May 1691, 20 years after he had made his gifts to the college. Hodge acknowledged that for some, Rustat’s willingness to invest in the slave trade at all made his memorial a problem. Quoting LP Hartley’s 1953 novel The Go-Between, he said its opening lines – “The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there” – did not excuse but could help to explain Rustat’s investments in transatlantic slavery. “I would hope that when Rustat’s life and career is fully and properly understood, and viewed as a whole, his memorial will cease to be seen as a monument to a slave trader,” he said. The college spokesperson said Rustat’s involvement in the slave trade had never been in question and opposition to the memorial was a result of that involvement rather than any false narrative. “This celebratory memorial to an active participant in the slave trade remains a barrier to worship in our chapel for some members of our community. It was right for us to have submitted this application. We will now carefully consider our next steps,” they said.",News/UK news,Church court rejects Cambridge college bid to move slave trader memorial,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/church-court-rejects-cambridge-college-bid-to-move-tobias-rustat-slave-trader-memorial
3/23/2022,"The Russian bombardment of the southern port of Mariupol continues with 100,000 civilians trapped, according to the Ukrainian president, Vlodomyr Zelenskiy. There are also fears for civilians in Cherniv, where the Russian bombing of a bridge has cut its evacuation route out to Kyiv and the main channel for humanitarian aid in. Authorities have begun to ration drinking water. Following Ukrainian claims to have retaken the town of Makariv, the Pentagon said it had seen “indications that the Ukrainians are going a bit more on the offensive now.” Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
3/23/2022,"Roberto Mancini has not been persuaded yet to dial back his ambitions. He insisted at his first press conference as Italy manager, back in 2018, that he intended to put the Azzurri back “on top of the world”. On Monday, before a Qatar 2022 qualifying play-off semi-final against North Macedonia, he echoed that sentiment, saying: “The objective is not to go to the World Cup, but to win it.” In public, at least, Mancini has never wavered in his conviction that Italy will reach November’s tournament. Not all his compatriots are so convinced. The president of the Italian Football Federation, Gabriele Gravina, lamented a national culture of naysaying; the “gufi e gufetti” as he called them – literally, “owls and little owls”, but used in Italian superstition as a symbol for jinxes – “perching on branches of bad luck”. Some anxiety is understandable in a country desperate to see its football team back at the World Cup after failing to qualify for the previous edition – the first time Italy had missed out for 60 years. Yet the context is very different this time. Italy never found an identity under Mancini’s predecessor, Giampiero Ventura, changing tactics constantly and suffering a 3-0 humiliation by Spain when they showed up at the Santiago Bernabéu for a key qualifier with an untested 4-2-4. Disaffection with the manager was illustrated vividly when Daniele De Rossi refused to come off the bench in the play-off second leg against Sweden. Mancini’s Italy arrive as European champions. True, their 37-game unbeaten run was ended in the Nations League semi-final by Spain but, even then, they rebounded to beat Belgium in the third-place play-off. Italy are yet to lose a game in this World Cup qualifying run – dropping into the play-offs because of too many draws: against Switzerland (twice), Bulgaria and Northern Ireland. And yet, there are reasonable causes for concern. Mancini has indicated that, with limited preparation time, he will rely on the core group who won the Euros. But against North Macedonia he is expected to be without three-quarters of the defence that started the final against England. The one retained starter, Emerson, was a mid-tournament replacement for Leonardo Spinazzola. Up front, Italy have lost Federico Chiesa to injury and Lorenzo Insigne’s form has dipped since last summer. Ciro Immobile is expected to keep his place in the No 9 role, and recently surpassed Silvio Piola as Lazio’s all-time leading scorer in Serie A, but he has not found the net for Italy in six games. A lack of goals is what put the Azzurri in this position. They conceded twice in eight group games – the joint-fewest in Uefa qualifying – but scored two goals across the four draws. Mancini is not short of options. Together with Immobile and Andrea Belotti – Italy’s alternate No 9 at the Euros – he has called up three more centre-forwards chosen for their varied skillsets: the 6ft 4in Gianluca Scamacca, whose game is built around physicality, his 5ft 8in Sassuolo teammate Giacomo Raspadori, a nimble and explosive runner, and Cagliari’s João Pedro, a more technical player comfortable taking up deeper positions. Each has excelled at club level this season, and Mancini might consider the benefit of combining Scamacca or Raspadori with another Sassuolo player, Domenico Berardi, who is expected to start on the right of attack in Italy’s 4-3-3. But those first two players have nine international appearances and a single goal between them. João Pedro is yet to win his first cap. Italy will be favourites regardless against North Macedonia, who have themselves lost key figures since Euro 2020. Goran Pandev, their all-time leader in appearances and goals, retired from international football last summer, while Eljif Elmas, the Napoli midfielder and one of their joint-top scorers in qualifying, is suspended. Most significant may be the departure of Igor Angelovski, the manager who qualified North Macedonia for the Euros – their first participation in a major tournament as an independent nation – and led them to an upset win over Germany last March. Even so, they are not a team to be taken lightly. Italy faced North Macedonia twice in their 2018 qualifying campaign, drawing in Turin and requiring a 92nd-minute winner from Immobile to win in Skopje. The Italian government has granted dispensation for a full crowd at Palermo’s Stadio Renzo Barbera – at a time when other sporting events are limited to 75% of capacity because of the pandemic – in further evidence of how much this occasion is weighing on a nation’s psyche. “We should not have been here,” said Mancini on Monday, but he prefers to focus on the positives. “I have talented players who built a victory out of nothing that nobody believed in. That does not guarantee you getting to the World Cup, but it’s a solid base.”",Sport/Football,Roberto Mancini targets winning World Cup before Italy’s play-off ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/23/roberto-mancini-targets-winning-world-cup-before-italys-play-off
3/23/2022,"Living standards in Britain are expected to fall at the fastest annual rate since the mid-1950s and will take until at least 2024 to return to pre-Covid levels, according to the government’s independent economic forecaster. Despite the measures announced by Rishi Sunak at his spring statement, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said real household disposable incomes per person would fall by 2.2% in 2022-23 as earnings from work fail to keep pace with soaring inflation. It said the fall would be the biggest in a single financial year since modern records began in 1956-57, and that it would take until 2024-25 for inflation-adjusted living standards to return to their pre-pandemic level. Highlighting an unprecedented squeeze on households as inflation soared after the Covid pandemic, made worse by the further rise in global energy prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the OBR said the damage for families would mean lower levels of consumer spending in the UK economy. With households expected to have less disposable income as prices increase, the Treasury’s tax and spending watchdog issued a sharp downgrade for its GDP growth forecasts this year to 3.8%, down from a previous estimate for growth of 6% when it last published predictions in October. The OBR said the government’s preferred measure of inflation was now forecast to peak at close to 9% this year. It added that its forecasts were completed a week into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, enabling large movements in global energy prices to be taken into account in its estimates.

3/23/2022,"Israel blocked Ukraine from buying NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware for fear that Russian officials would be angered by the sale of the sophisticated hacking tool to a regional foe, according to people familiar with the matter. The revelation, following a joint investigation by the Guardian and Washington Post, offers new insight into the way Israel’s relationship with Russia has at times undermined Ukraine’s offensive capabilities – and contradicted US priorities. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has been critical of Israel’s stance since Russia launched its full and bloody invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, saying in a recent address before members of Israel’s Knesset that Israel would have to “give answers” on why it had not given weapons to Ukraine or applied sanctions on Russians. People with direct knowledge of the matter say that, dating back to at least 2019, Ukrainian officials lobbied Israel to try to convince it to license the spyware tool for use by Ukraine. But those efforts were rebuffed and NSO Group, which is regulated by the Israeli ministry of defense, was never permitted to market or sell the company’s spyware to Ukraine. When it is successfully deployed against a target, Pegasus can be used to hack into any mobile phone and intercept phone conversations, read text messages, or view a user’s photographs. It can also be used to as a remote listening device, because a government user of the spyware can use it to remotely turn a mobile phone recorder on and off. Recent press reports accounts, including by the Pegasus project, a media consortium that investigated NSO and included the Guardian and Washington Post, has focused on how the spyware has been used by NSO’s government clients to target journalists and human rights defenders around the world. The consortium’s reporting has also showed how, from Hungary to Saudi Arabia, sales of Pegasus were often aligned with Israeli foreign policy. The spyware has also been used against senior government and diplomatic officials, from Spain to France to Uganda, in cases that were seen as attempts by some countries to use the tool to conduct domestic or international espionage. NSO has said its spyware is meant to be used by government clients to target serious criminals and terrorists. It has also said it investigates serious allegations of abuse. People with knowledge of the matter said that in most routine cases, Israel’s ministry of defense first grants NSO permission to market Pegasus to a government client and then, following a review, either allows or blocks a sale of the technology. One senior Ukrainian intelligence official said Israel’s decision had left Ukrainian officials feeling “confused”. The official said he did not have total visibility into why Ukraine was denied access to the powerful spying tool but added that he believed the US government supported Ukraine’s efforts. Sources close to the matter said Israel’s decision reflected a reluctance to agitate Russia, which has a close intelligence relationship with Israel. The sources said Israel feared that granting Ukraine the ability to target Russia-based mobile phone numbers through Pegasus would be viewed as an act of aggression against Russian intelligence services. It was not the only time one of Russia’s key regional foes had been denied some access to Pegasus. People familiar with the matter say that Estonia, a Nato member, acquired access to Pegasus in 2019 but was informed by NSO in August that year that the company would not permit Estonian officials to use the spyware against Russian targets. The Estonian ministry of defense spokeswoman Susan Lilleväli declined to comment. In response to a detailed set of questions, NSO issued a one-line statement: “NSO continues to be subjected to inaccurate media reports regarding alleged clients, which are based on hearsay, political innuendo and untruths.” The Israeli defense ministry on Tuesday also responded to a list of questions by issuing a statement that did not directly address most of them. “The state of Israel regulates marketing and export of cyber products in accordance with the 2007 Defense Export Control Act,” the statement said. It added: “Policy decisions regarding export controls take into account security and strategic considerations, which include adherence to international arrangements. As a matter of policy, the state of Israel approves the export of cyber products exclusively to governmental entities, for lawful use, and only for the purpose of preventing and investigating crime and counter terrorism, under end-use/end-user declarations provided by the acquiring government.” Nearly a month into the war, Ukraine’s armed forces – though massively outnumbered – have surprised outside observers by containing Russian military advances, even as Russia has bombarded civilian targets and is seeking to raze the port city of Mariupol. Ukrainian officials declined to comment on Pegasus or their overall efforts to seek powerful surveillance technology. But Mykhailo Fedorov, a vice-prime minister who oversees digital technology for Ukraine, said: “The government of Israel is at this time not participating in any discussion or facilitation regarding offensive tech, but we have ongoing conversations with a lot of the Israeli companies in the market and they’re at various stages. But again, let me say this: we have enough capability to continue winning and we’re adding new tools, including emerging tools, every day.” Experts say Israel has political motives to stay close to Russia, from its hopes that Moscow will refrain from signing a revival of the Iran nuclear deal, which is close to completion in Vienna, to its reliance on Russia to mount attacks on Iranian positions inside Syria. Ukraine’s request for Pegasus was previously reported by Israel’s Channel 12. Zelenskiy’s address to the Knesset last weekend was delivered as the government of Israel’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett, who is brokering negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, has faced criticism for adopting what is in effect a neutral stance on the war. Bennett has spoken directly to Zelenskiy and Putin while his foreign minister has met with his US counterpart, Antony Blinken. While Bennett was ultimately persuaded to support a UN general assembly resolution on 2 March to condemn Russia for its illegal invasion, Zelenskiy complained about Israel’s inaction in his Knesset address. Israel also refused to sell its Iron Dome missile defense system to Ukraine last year, the Israeli news organization Ynet recently reported. “We ask why we’re not receiving weapons from you, why you haven’t applied sanctions on Russia, and on Russian businesses. You will need to give answers, and to be able to live with those answers,” he said in the address.",News/World news,"Israel blocked Ukraine from buying Pegasus spyware, fearing Russia’s anger",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/israel-ukraine-pegasus-spyware-russia
