1/30/2022,"Spotify's communications chief reportedly told employees that episodes of Joe Rogan's podcast ""didn't meet the threshold for removal."" The Verge published a list of Spotify's internal company content policies around healthcare Friday. The controversy prompted singers Neil Young and Joni Mitchell to pull their music over Rogan's COVID-19 misinformation. Leaked internal messages from Spotify offer a glimpse into the company's decision to keep airing Joe Rogan's podcast, which has come under fire for promoting COVID-19 misinformation. The Verge reported Friday that Dustee Jenkins, Spotify's head of global communications and public relations, broached the subject with concerned employees in an internal Slack channel. Jenkins told them the company reviewed multiple episodes of podcast ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" but concluded they ""didn't meet the threshold for removal,"" according to leaked screenshots of her message that were viewed by The Verge. COVID-19 and misinformation that surrounds the disease are still spreading. We bring back Syra Madad (@syramadad) and Stephen Morse to debunk 14 new coronavirus myths. They talk about the effectiveness of masks and what it'll take to reopen schools and keep them open. They also debunk the idea that holding your breath when someone sneezes or coughs keeps you safe. Here's why that and many other things you might be hearing about the coronavirus aren't true. ""We apply our policies consistently and objectively,"" Jenkins wrote. ""They are not influenced by the media cycle, calls from any one individual or from external partners. It doesn't mean I personally agree with this content. But I trust our policies and the rationale behind them."" The Verge also published Spotify's internal content guidelines pertaining to healthcare. They prohibit behavior such as denying that COVID-19 exists, suggesting that mask-wearing causes life-threatening physical harm, and ""promoting or suggesting that vaccines are designed to cause death,"" according to the news site. ""What Spotify hasn't done is move fast enough to share these policies externally, and are working to address that as soon as possible,"" Jenkins wrote. Earlier this week, ""Heart of Gold"" artist Neil Young demanded Spotify remove his music from its platform over COVID-19 misinformation, saying, ""Spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines – potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them."" Young delivered an ultimatum, adding, ""They can have Rogan or Young. Not both."" Spotify announced a few days later that it will pull Young's music catalog from its platform. ""We regret Neil's decision to remove his music from Spotify, but hope to welcome him back soon,"" the company told The Wall Street Journal. ""We want all the world's music and audio content to be available to Spotify users. With that comes great responsibility in balancing both safety for listeners and freedom for creators."" Joni Mitchell announced Friday that she'll also be pulling her music from Spotify over ""lies that are costing people their lives."" Earlier this month, 270 scientists, healthcare workers, and educators signed an open letter calling on Spotify to stop the spread of misinformation on its platform following an episode of Rogan's podcast in which he interviewed a doctor who baselessly claimed Americans were ""hypnotized"" into wearing masks and getting COVID-19 vaccines because of what he calls ""mass formation psychosis."" Psychology experts have said there is no such phenomenon. Spotify did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

1/30/2022,"Andrew Williams pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count relating to the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. The FBI found a photo of a Democratic lawmaker with a shooting target superimposed over her, in his home. In a sentencing memorandum, federal prosecutors asked he be sentenced to 30 days' incarceration. The FBI found a photograph of a Democratic member of Congress with a shooting target superimposed over her body in the home of a Capitol Riot defendant, federal prosecutors said. A firefighter from Sanford, Florida, Andrew Williams, pleaded guilty in November to a misdemeanor count of parading, demonstrating, or picketing inside a Capitol building. After Williams was arrested following the January 6 insurrection, the FBI searched his home and found the photograph of an unnamed Democratic lawmaker, according to the sentencing memorandum filed on Friday, viewed by Insider. Along with the shooting target superimposed over her body, a beret with a hammer and sickle symbol was on the lawmaker's head. During his pre-sentencing interview with law enforcement, Williams said that the target was a ""secret Santa"" gift from a co-worker, the memo said. Agents said they also found a roll of ""Q"" stickers in Williams' home, referring to the QAnon conspiracy theory. In the memorandum, prosecutors requested the court sentence Williams to a split sentence of 30 days' incarceration, two years of probation, 60 hours of community service, and $500 in restitution. Williams was identified as a Capitol riot participant after a Sanford law-enforcement officer saw a photo he posted online of himself in the Capitol. In videos taken during the insurrection, later obtained by the FBI, Williams doubted he would be arrested. ""How are they going to arrest every single person?"" Williams said in a video taken inside the Capitol, according to an FBI affidavit seen by Insider. ""We are storming the Capitol! Yeah, baby!"" Williams says in a different video, according to the affidavit. In his interview with law enforcement ahead of his sentencing, Williams said that he regretted his conduct and that it didn't feel like a riot at the time, the sentencing memorandum said. More than 760 people have been arrested for the Capitol attack, and more than 170 have pleaded guilty.

1/30/2022,"A truck convoy being dubbed the “Freedom Rally” in Canada got support from an ousted Canadian hockey staple on Friday, as Don Cherry made it clear he is completely on board. “I am 100% behind the truckers,” Cherry said to the Toronto Sun on Friday. “They are salt of the earth and the heartbeat of the country.” The rally, which has seen trucks along with supporters convoy from various parts of the country to Ottawa, began as a protest against vaccine mandates put in place by the Canadian government. However, it has essentially transitioned to a movement pushing to end all COVID-19 restrictions across Canada. “It should always be a person’s own choice,” Cherry said in regards to the vaccine mandate. “I have had three shots but it was my own decision. I did not tell anybody else what they should do and would never tell anybody what they should do. It’s up to them.” Cherry did go on to mention that he thinks people are in the right to protest things they disagree with, as long as they do so “peacefully.” Unfortunately, there have reportedly been some causing trouble in Ottawa, something Cherry hopes doesn’t ruin it for individuals who are causing no harm. The former Hockey Night In Canada icon, as you may remember, was relieved of his duties by Sportsnet and the CBC back in November of 2019 after his now infamous ""you people"" rant — which appeared to chastise immigrants for not wearing poppies to commemorate Remembrance Day — was blasted across airwaves on live TV. Though he has since tried to clarify his comments at the time, the 87-year-old has not been welcomed back to Sportsnet or the mainstream Canadian spotlight in general, but has managed to stay involved in the media world with his ‘The Don Cherry’s Grapevine’ podcast. More from Yahoo Sports On Monday, Toronto Maple Leafs captain John Tavares joined the growing chorus of players speaking out to address recent incidents of racism in hockey. On the latest episode of 'In the Mentions', Omar asks fans to speak up in support of Jordan Subban, Jalen Smereck and Boko Imama; and demand that hockey take steps to be more inclusive than slogans. ",World/Yahoo Sports Canada,Don Cherry stands firmly behind Canadian 'Freedom Rally' truck convoy,https://news.yahoo.com/nhl-canada-don-cherry-backs-freedom-rally-truckers-convoy-ottawa-020120890.html
