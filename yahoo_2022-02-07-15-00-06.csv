2/7/2022,"A man in Oregon tricked a woman into thinking she was training to be a DEA agent for a year, authorities say. Authorities accused him of keeping fake badges, tactical vests, and a rifle that was actually a BB gun. When caught, the man told agents he and his ""trainee"" had the equipment because they were ""into cosplay."" A woman in Oregon who believed that she was training to be a Drug Enforcement Administration agent realized she had been tricked for a year by a man pretending to be her supervisor, according to a criminal complaint seen by Insider. Robert Edward Golden, 41, is accused by Portland officials of impersonating a DEA special agent, using false credentials to gain information from residents, and installing red and blue emergency lighting in his car to navigate traffic. He also kept a tactical vest affixed with ""DEA Police"" patches, two body armor plate carriers, handcuffs, badges, and an AR-15 style rifle which turned out to be a BB gun, an affidavit from DEA Special Agent Morgan T. Barr said. Authorities discovered and detained the pair on February 1, after a police sergeant noticed one of the vests in the open trunk of Golden's car and approached them. The officer asked Golden if he was a sworn federal agent, and Golden said that he and his ""trainee"" were both ""feds"" working in Portland. Golden then told the woman to show the officer her fake badge, according to the complaint. The pair were transferred that night to DEA investigators, and Golden then admitted the credentials were fake, according to the affidavit. This time, he claimed he and the woman were ""into cosplay"" and had the equipment and badges because it provided them with ""protection,"" per officials. Golden also said he had previously helped break up a fight by shouting: ""Police!"" and holding up his badge like an officer, per the document. According to the affidavit, the unidentified ""trainee,"" who wasn't charged, told authorities that Golden had given her a DEA badge and photo ID and said she'd been in training for a year while attending school for Criminal Justice. She said Golden had taken her on night surveillance ""ride-alongs."" She said he also took her practice shooting and often mentioned four other supposed DEA agents by name — ""Agent Anderson, Agent Luis, Agent Garcia, and Ms. Bennett."" The DEA agent who filed the complaint said there weren't any agents on the force by those names and that the agency doesn't provide ""ride-alongs."" The complaint did not mention Golden's possible motivation for tricking the woman into believing she was a DEA agent. If found guilty, Golden faces up to three years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, The Oregonian reported, citing Assistant US Attorney Greg Nyhus.

2/7/2022,"Fox News completely upended statistics it claimed proved that Democrats run the unhealthiest cities in the nation. The Fox face-plant Saturday evening was spotted by Twitter sleuth @Acyn, and got a shout-out from CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale. Dan Bongino, host of “Unfiltered” — who has been permanently banned by Youtube.com for spinning COVID lies — savaged Democrats in the “Tale of Two Cities” episode for running what a dramatic map behind him targeted as the “Top Ten” unhealthiest cities in America. But, oops — all the cities clearly labeled in the map Bongino displayed — including San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Honolulu, D.C., Austin and Denver — are the healthiest in the country, according to a WalletHub analysis, the very source cited by the program. Bongino’s map also mistakenly names “Irving” in Texas in the top ten list. The WalletHub analysis actually refers to “Irvine,” a city in California, as among the healthiest. The actual unhealthiest cities named in the WalletHub analysis cited in Bongino’s program include cities in Louisiana, Alabama, Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia and Tennessee — all red states. Viewers on Twitter reported that Bongino’s program was modified when it was repeated later Saturday night — without the blatantly inaccurate map listing the “most unhealthy” cities. Still, he nevertheless scapegoated Democrats for running unhealthy cities— even in the face of the eliminated, starkly contradictory, analysis. The second time around, Bongino’s Dem-attack narrative was presented over videos of apparently homeless people in unidentified locations. Here’s the bottom 10 from that list. I guess they didn’t show these because of which party runs them. pic.twitter.com/mkq66cikfk — Kamiano75 (@kamiano75) February 6, 2022 They changed it already. You post made them change the repeat at midnight on Fox. pic.twitter.com/AdQWeAEl2G — The Rok (@CrakRok) February 6, 2022 Fox News critics on Twitter loved the goof-up, even though many thought it was a new low for the network. Lol…Irving…This list is ridiculous. — Jay 🇺🇸⚓️🇨🇦 (@jgmiddlet) February 6, 2022 This is why we should always click on sources. They think were too lazy to do it but, often the source does not confirm the original information. In this case it’s the LITERAL opposite. — PoliticsGirl (@IAmPoliticsGirl) February 6, 2022 So they blatantly took the top 10 healthiest and said they were the top 10 UNhealthiest? Even for Fox News this seems ridiculous. — Abraham Dylan (@abrahamdylan4) February 6, 2022 I thought you were kidding until I had to look it up myself. Why does Fox keep deceiving its viewers? Don’t they know that this information is easily available on the net? pic.twitter.com/4G0CNcdJdQ — Will Sr- Democracy Won 💙❤ (@freshprince84) February 6, 2022 Fox News told The Daily Beast that it “regrets the error” and a correction will be issued — next week on Bongino’s program.
