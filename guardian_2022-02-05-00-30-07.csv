2/5/2022,"Aaron Bell has become the latest Conservative MP to announce publicly that he has submitted a letter of no confidence in Boris Johnson. More than a dozen MPs have called publicly for the prime minister to resign, as the “partygate” scandal continues to undermine his authority. More are believed to have submitted letters privately.  “The breach of trust that the events in Downing Street represent, and the manner in which they have been handled, makes [Johnson’s] position untenable,” he said in a statement. If 54 letters are sent to the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, a vote of no confidence would be called. Bell, the MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, challenged the prime minister in the House of Commons on Monday after the publication of the Sue Gray report into lockdown parties. Bell said he had complied with all the rules, and asked Johnson pointedly: “Am I a fool?” In his statement, Bell said he had submitted his letter after that clash – but only made it public after discussions with his local party.",News/Politics,Aaron Bell is latest Tory MP to submit letter of no confidence in Boris Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/04/aaron-bell-is-latest-tory-mp-to-submit-letter-of-no-confidence-in-boris-johnson
2/5/2022,"Beijing again hosted an opening ceremony for the Olympics, and like the Summer Games in 2008, it was directed by Zhang Yimou. The event was on a much smaller and more muted scale than that memorable occasion – with 3,000 people taking part as opposed to 15,000. The motto, in a Games inevitably impacted by the Covid pandemic and mired with political controversy, was to be simple, safe and splendid.  Rather than having specifically recorded music for the athletes’ parade, it was accompanied by a selection of 19 well-known classical music excerpts which wouldn’t be out of place on Now That’s What I Call Classical Music. Organisers said it was to show the respect of the Chinese people to culture from around the world. Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring would have been appropriate, as the season featured heavily as the opening theme. The lifecycle of the dandelion was represented by dancers carrying improbably tall and flexible glowing green stalks, which eventually turned white and were seen on video screen to be floating up into the sky as the seeds dispersed. Fireworks then wrote the word ‘spring’ in the sky above Beijing’s Bird’s Nest stadium. Those of a certain vintage would have been reminded of the old Fox’s Glacier Mint adverts as a giant ice cube rose from the floor. This was the ceremony’s moment to acknowledge the Games that had come before, as lasers appeared to etch on its surface the names and dates of the 23 cities to previously host the Winter Games, going right back to Chamonix in 1924. Olympic opening and closing ceremonies have, over the years, become a theatrical genre in their own right. They need to be designed to work for both the audience in the stadium and on television screens across the globe. One sequence featured children dancing and singing across the arena, while the LED screens beneath them automatically tracked their footsteps, making stars appear at their feet as they performed and moved around. The lead-up to these Games have been marked with political protests over the International Olympic Committee’s decision to award the hosting rights to China. In London, as the ceremony took place, there was a demonstration outside the Chinese embassy. There were also protests against the Games in Istanbul, Berlin and New Delhi – the Olympics uniting people in a way that the organisers had not wanted. Haiti and Saudi Arabia are making their Winter Olympics debut – both of them sending one man to compete in the Alpine skiing; 19-year-old Richardson Viano carried the Caribbean nation’s flag, while 24-year-old Fayik Abdi is representing the Middle Eastern kingdom. The delegation from Taiwan had initially indicated they would not attend the ceremony. The IOC insisted they must. Due to China’s long-standing objection to the country using the name Taiwan at the Games, their athletes had to march under a banner saying Chinese Taipei and a neutral flag. Ho Ping-jui and Huang Yu-ting genuinely did not look thrilled to be there. Designed by Ben Sherman, and modelled below by flag-bearer and curling medal hope Eve Muirhead, the main feature of the Team GB uniform for the opening ceremony appeared to be a nice chunky-knit jumper that would keep you warm on a fishing trip. No word as to whether Team GB’s most famous knitter – diving gold medallist Tom Daley – was involved in the choice. Speed skater Yekaterina Aidova of Kazakhstan put most countries’ costume efforts to shame. The Kazakhstan team had also arranged a synchronised move to take off their scarves and wave them in unison. Elsa Desmond was carrying Ireland’s flag. Incredibly she had to set up the Irish Luge Federation from scratch herself in order to be able to compete. As well as working to qualify for the Winter Olympics, during the pandemic she also qualified as a doctor, and as soon as the Games finish she will be back to where she works in a hospital in Southend, Essex. Freestyle skier Brendan Newby joined her in carrying the flag. Treading a delicate line – Chinese authorities have cracked down on political dissent before the Games and the Beijing Winter Olympics Athletes’ Commission has warned athletes against speaking out – the IOC president Thomas Bach gave a short speech where he praised the diversity of the Games, and explicitly called out against discrimination. There was a message too for world leaders, with a call for the observation of the Olympic truce Bach told them to “give peace a chance”. A different John Lennon song – Imagine – also got another opening ceremony outing, as it had at Tokyo last year. The cutest sequence was without doubt a video insert of children on ice and snow learning to take part in winter sports. Like something out of You’ve Been Framed, you can’t go wrong with children falling over in the snow. That led up to the lighting of the Olympic flame. Ceremonies have begun competing to have different iconic lightings of the flame. We had been promised something never seen before. The giant snowflake that had been a feature of the ceremony had been made by interlocking the signs that had been held up in front of each team as they entered the arena. The Olympic torch was placed in the middle of it, hoisted into the sky and the show was over, leaving the sporting action to begin.",Sport/Sport,Winter Olympics: 11 key moments from Beijing 2022 opening ceremony,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/04/beijing-2022-winter-olympics-opening-ceremony-11-key-moments
2/5/2022,"Paul Nicholls was the last British trainer to land the Irish Gold Cup, with Neptune Collonges in 2009, and his decision to send Frodon to the latest renewal at Leopardstown on Saturday adds further depth to what was already a fascinating contest. Kemboy, who always gives his best over this track and trip, leads the home defence along with Minella Indo, last year’s Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, and Asterion Forlonge, who fell at the last when booked for second in the King George on Boxing Day.  Frodon (3.15) was a long way below his best in the King George but Bryony Frost’s mount was taken on for the lead there and should have an easier time in front on Saturday. This also looks like his major target for the second half of the season, and he is a decent bet at around 3-1 to extend Nicholls’s current win streak in Ireland to four. Sandown 1.15 All eight runners go to post with a chance but Rikoboy looks overpriced at around 6-1 after a promising return from a 10-month break last month. Leopardstown 1.35 Five are unbeaten in Ireland’s only Grade One juvenile hurdle before Cheltenham, while Vauban, a half-length second to Pied Piper on debut, will tie the form to the current Triumph favourite. Ben Siegel, an easy winner in a strong time in November, is overlooked in the market at around 16-1 but has significant scope for improvement and an excellent each-way alternative to the market leaders. Sandown 1.50 Goshen is very difficult to catch right but his latest run at Lingfield was his best for a while and this return to Sandown, where he won impressively as a four-year-old, should suit. Musselburgh 2.05 Cool Mix generally gives his running and has dropped back to his last winning mark so looks the obvious bet here at around 3-1. Sandown 2.20 L’Homme Presse has made rapid progress from his successful chasing debut off 122 in December and can complete his rise through the ranks with a Grade One victory here. Wetherby 2.30 The betting implies a stroll for Ahoy Senor but Saint Palais has progressed with every start over fences, put up a new career-best last time and has a better chance than odds of 3-1 might suggest.

2/5/2022,"Conservative MPs have privately been venting their anger at the appointment of a former Sky executive, who entered parliament in 2019, as the replacement for Munira Mirza as the head of No 10’s policy unit. MPs from northern ”red wall” areas were particularly vehement about the promotion of Andrew Griffith, a former investment banker representing a safe Tory seat in West Sussex, to a key role in shaping new government ideas.  “What does he know about real life?” asked one new northern Tory MP, who had not yet submitted a letter of no confidence in Boris Johnson but suggested Griffith’s arrival would “probably mean more letters”. Even one MP who spoke highly of Griffith said moving him to replace Mirza “shouldn’t have been done quite so quickly and brutally”. Griffith is – outwardly at least – a supporter of classic low-tax, deregulatory Conservatism whose appointment could mean a pivot away from the “culture wars” sometimes associated with Mirza. But while they acknowledge his business acumen, many of his colleagues doubt Griffith is sufficiently politically minded to do the job effectively. Griffith, who became the MP for the safe seat of Arundel and the South in 2019 after two failed bids in Corby, grew up in the London suburb of Bromley before studying law and becoming a chartered accountant. After a stint at Rothschild investment bank, he joined Sky in 1999, and rose to the top of the broadcaster during its Murdoch years, becoming the group’s finance chief in 2008 and later chief operating officer. He was an early supporter of the leadership ambitions of Johnson, who used Griffith’s lavish Westminster townhouse as a base for plotting his first 100 days in office. When Mirza was appointed to head up the policy unit in 2019, Griffith was made No 10’s chief business adviser, working to mend relations for a new prime minister who reputedly said “fuck business” when confronted with companies’ concerns over Brexit. In 2021, Johnson appointed Griffith his principal private secretary, a role that acts as a conduit between MPs and government. Many MPs view him as having been partially responsible for the subsequent breakdown in relations between backbenchers and No 10 , with one saying there had been a “resounding call from the backbenchers” to remove him from the position. Among those welcoming Griffith’s appointment this week was David Soskin, a former special adviser to John Major, who tweeted that the MP had “enjoyed a glittering career outside the bubble” and who “understood Conservative values”. “We now need a policy reset with a particular emphasis on deregulation, economic growth and tax reduction,” Soskin added. His tweet was “liked” by Griffith’s own account, which features a tanned profile photo of him wearing a suit and open-necked shirt combination favoured by male media executives.",News/Politics,Red-wall Tories irate as ex-Sky boss takes over at No 10 policy unit,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/04/red-wall-tories-irate-as-ex-sky-boss-andrew-griffith-takes-over-at-no-10-policy-unit
2/5/2022,"The Omicron variant is causing record numbers of new Covid infections in Russia and Ukraine, threatening to impact military calculations over Russia’s continued troop buildup. Analysts have cited various factors as possible contributors to whether and how Russia will launch an assault on Ukraine, ranging from Vladimir Putin’s psychological state to the strength of the western response and even the firmness of the ground during a mild winter in the region.  Covid is emerging as another element that may complicate plans for the Russian and Ukrainian armies, as record case numbers in both societies are replicated among the troops. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of the Ukrainian land forces, told the Guardian that from about 150,000 soldiers in his ranks, 2,400 were infected by Covid. Testing was taking place only before special events or in the case of symptoms, he said, suggesting the real number might be much higher. Ukrainian military bases have been closed to visitors to help prevent the spread. “It’s not dramatically affecting our plans, because few people are getting seriously ill, but of course we are having to ensure isolation of cases and also to be more careful with mask-wearing and other anti-Covid measures,” he said, in an interview at the Boryspil military airfield on Thursday. Ukrainian officials believe Covid has swept through the Russian soldiers placed close to the border and participating in exercises in neighbouring Belarus. Ukraine’s ministry of health said on Friday morning that 43,778 new infections had been registered in the past day, the highest total since the pandemic began. It was an increase of more than 4,000 on the previous day, which also set a record. The Omicron variant has also hit hard in Russia, where an all-time high for new cases was also reported on Friday, with 168,201 new infections in the past 24 hours. Both the Russian and Ukrainian armies have much higher rates of vaccination than among their respective general populations, where vaccine scepticism is widespread. In both countries, less than half of the population has been fully vaccinated. The Moscow Times calculated recently that Russia has had nearly a million excess fatalities since the beginning of the pandemic. Syrskyi said 99.3% of the Ukrainian army had received two doses of a vaccine, and that booster shots were being rolled out. As of November, 95% of Russia’s army personnel has been vaccinated and 25% received boosters, according to the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. “Lethality of Covid is 45 times lower among army personnel than in the population at large,” Shoigu claimed in a meeting with Putin. Still, the sheer number of current infections means large numbers of troops will be taken out of action for days at a time as Putin continues to keep the world guessing about his intentions. British and US officials have said a major Russian military assault may be “imminent”, and on Thursday, US intelligence claimed to have information that the Russians were preparing a staged video of an atrocity to act as a pretext to intervene. Syrskyi said Ukrainian forces were ready for anything, but echoed other Ukrainian officials in dismissing the idea that a major military assault was imminent, instead saying the Kremlin goal seemed to be to exert psychological pressure and create panic in Ukrainian society. “We see training, we see movement, but we don’t see direct attack preparations or the preparation of strike forces,” he said. He added that basic military doctrine suggested the Russians would need three times as many attack forces as Ukraine had defensive troops in order to launch an attack, and said Russia currently did not have this on any section of the Ukrainian border. “We would also expect to see logistics bases, field hospitals. This is all visible from space, we will know if and when it starts to happen,” he said.",News/World news,Record Covid cases in Russia and Ukraine complicate military plans,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/04/record-covid-cases-in-russia-and-ukraine-complicate-conflict-situation
2/5/2022,"Whether it’s rewilding the garden or setting up a bee hotel, many of us are rethinking our relationship with the natural world and becoming more nurturing. But what of the often maligned fox? Shouldn’t we include it? I asked Trevor Williams, the founder of fox rescue charity the Fox Project, if we should feed them. Hi, Trevor! Seen any good foxes today?No, I’m too old to go out with the ambulances, though sometimes I bottle-feed the cubs.  Cute! Speaking of feeding, I met someone who said they leave dog food out for the foxes claiming it was a) nice, and b) stopped them going through the bins. Is this genius or madness?Generally we suggest people don’t feed foxes, because it will undermine their territory if they can’t be bothered to go farther afield. Also, foxes don’t just take what they need – they take what’s available and bury it for later. And if it’s constantly turning up in nextdoor’s flowerpots, they may end up getting in someone to deal with the foxes lethally. Lethal? But foxes don’t count as pests, they’re wild. Wouldn’t that be illegal?Not quite. There are protections under the Wild Mammals Act, which make certain ways of killing illegal, but pest controllers use legal methods. Thankfully, most people like to see wildlife in their gardens, and feeding them can draw them in. So, if you’re doing that, feed a mixture of protein and roughage – their natural diet includes bone, fur, feather – and only a small amount, so they still need to scavenge. It’s just about compassion. Especially if there’s a hard winter. I love it when my vulpine visitors curl up on the shed in the sun, like a furry croissant. They’re keeping me up these days, though.It’s mating season. If it’s one voice, the sound is them calling to their chosen mate. Two voices means they’re meeting up, and that can be snappy. The vixen only comes into season for three days a year, so there can be a lot of attention from the male. Who hasn’t been the fox that calls too much, or the vixen snapping back, am I right, Trevor? Anyway, do people still think of foxes as dangerous?Some do, but there’s definitely been a change. In 2010, twin babies were attacked by a fox. People were phoning us saying: “Why are you defending foxes? Our children are in danger.” In 2018, a child was bitten and people called us, but they were asking for advice on deterring foxes, saying: “We know foxes don’t act like that normally.” That’s amazing progress. I’m very much here for the ever closer bond of humans and the wild. They need us, we need them …They don’t really. Wildlife can do perfectly well without us. Even in London, where people might think life is hard, there are plenty of rodents and birds. We’ve never seen an emaciated fox, unless it’s really unwell. They will always find food. OK, fine – it’s still nice to be together, though.Of course. It’s the power of seeing wildlife. You look a fox in the eye and you have a special connection. I remember an older lady telling me she lived in a dreadful concrete area in London but that she occasionally saw kestrels and foxes. And she said: “That gives me heart, because if they can make a living under the circumstances then I can, too.”",News/Environment,Should I feed foxes?

2/5/2022,"The former Labour peer Nazir Ahmed has been jailed for five years and six months after being convicted of sexual offences against two children in the 1970s. The 64-year-old was found guilty at Sheffield crown court in January of serious sexual assault against a boy aged 11 at the time, and twice attempting to rape a girl, when he was a teenager. He was sentenced at the same court on Friday by Mr Justice Lavender.  During the trial, the prosecutor Tom Little QC said Ahmed claimed the allegations were a “malicious fiction” but a recording of a 2016 phone conversation between the two victims showed they were not “made up or concocted”. Ahmed was charged alongside his two older brothers, Mohammed Farouq, 71, and Mohammed Tariq, 65, but both were deemed unfit to stand trial. Appointed a life peer by Tony Blair, Ahmed resigned from the Labour party in 2013 and retired from the House of Lords in 2020, but he has retained his peerage and the title of Lord Ahmed of Rotherham. Only an act of parliament can remove a peer’s title. The male victim, known as Mr B to protect his anonymity, told BBC Newsnight on Thursday that Ahmed should be stripped of his title. “That title is bestowed upon people that have got some honour, some dignity, and he’s got none of that,” he said. “I’m demanding the government take that peerage away from him.” He said he had spent much of his life trying to “to bury” the abuse to which he had been subjected. “You try to lead a normal life, but you can never lead a normal life,” he said.",News/UK news,Peer Nazir Ahmed jailed for sexual offences against children,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/peer-nazir-ahmed-jailed-for-sexual-offences-against-children
2/5/2022,"Weeks after the 2020 election, Donald Trump reviewed a draft executive order that authorized the national guard to seize voting machines and verbally agreed to appoint Sidney Powell, a campaign lawyer and conspiracy theorist, as special counsel to investigate election fraud.  The two previously unreported actions of the former president – which is certain to interest the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack and Trump’s efforts to overturn his defeat – came during a contentious White House meeting on 18 December 2020. Trump never followed through with issuing a formal executive order authorizing the seizure of voting machines or appointing a special counsel. But four sources with detailed knowledge of what transpired during the 18 December meeting described to the Guardian how close he came to doing so. The draft executive order Trump reviewed was one of the final versions Powell had prepared. An early version of the document was published by Politico. Another version, obtained by CNN, empowered the Department of Homeland Security instead of the Department of Defense. But all versions included language that would have allowed Trump to appoint a special counsel to investigate claims of foreign interference in the 2020 election, which the Department of Justice had already determined were without foundation. The draft executive order seen by Trump was retained automatically by the White House as a presidential record. It was recently turned over to the select committee by the National Archives after the supreme court rejected Trump’s appeal to block its release. Trump was handed the document when he sat down with four informal advisers – Powell, Trump’s former national security advisor Michael Flynn, former Trump aide Emily Newman and former Overstock chief executive Patrick Byrne – who had arrived at the White House unannounced. The group had not scheduled an audience with Trump, but after Byrne messaged an acquaintance, they were cleared to enter the White House by Garrett Ziegler, a policy aide to former Trump advisor Peter Navarro, and Patrick Weaver, an aide with the National Security Council. It is understood that the four were not registered in the West Wing guest access system as meeting with the former president, which may have violated national security protocols. In a statement, Byrne said Trump had called the group into the Oval Office after he saw Flynn, his former national security adviser, with the rest of the group about 25ft from the room. Eric Herschmann, a White House senior adviser, slipped in behind them. Trump first reviewed the draft executive order and documents brought by Powell, including a physical copy of Trump’s executive order 13848 that authorized sweeping powers in the event of foreign election interference, as she ran through the supposed legality of suspending normal law. Powell and Newman told Trump that he could rely on that order and classified National Security Presidential Memoranda 13 and 21 – cyber-security memos referenced in Powell’s draft executive order – to have the national guard seize voting machines. That prompted pushback from the former White House counsel Patrick Cipollone, who had joined the meeting with former White House staff secretary, Derek Lyons, who supported Cipollone’s claim that Trump lacked the constitutional authority to take such measures. Byrne made another attempt to convince Trump to appoint Powell as special counsel and have Flynn act as “field marshal” to coordinate her efforts. The draft executive order said Flynn would be “direct liaison” to coordinate the “applicable US departments and agencies”. Byrne claimed Trump had a range of options. He could decide whether to investigate election fraud in six, 12 or 31 states; whether to “image” hard drives in voting machines or seize them; and whether to have that done by the national guard, DHS or the FBI. Trump appeared open to such advice. Late that Friday night, two of the sources said, he told Cipollone he would just make Powell special counsel. When Cipollone said Powell would need a security clearance, which he said was probably impossible, Trump said he would grant it. But after nearly all of Trump’s formal advisers shot down Powell’s suggestions, Trump did not sign the draft executive order. Instead, he instructed Powell to coordinate with his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, about seizing voting machines or appointing a special counsel. That posed a problem for Powell, who had been ejected from the Trump campaign’s legal team a few weeks beforehand at Giulaini’s behest. The group then tried again to cajole Trump into issuing some sort of executive order, since Trump still appeared intrigued. But when Trump summoned Giuliani, the former president’s attorney said the gambit would work only in the event of clear foreign interference. Powell, who had spent the previous weeks filing lawsuits alleging that Iran and China hacked into voting machines, sprang up and announced both to everyone in the room and a coterie of aides who had been dialled in on a conference call, that she had a file full of such evidence. Giuliani looked at the documents but told Trump that Powell’s evidence was worthless, accusing her of producing one witness who was willing to testify about foreign election interference and around 10 who had simply signed affidavits saying they agreed. Top advisers including Cipollone and Lyons have told associates they did not think the exchange about making Powell special counsel was serious. But Trump continued for days to mull the special counsel and voting machine ideas. A spokesperson for Trump and a spokesperson for Cipollone did not respond to requests for comment. Powell, Giuliani and Lyons did not respond either. A spokesman for the select committee declined to comment on how the meeting might feature in its investigation. Powell told associates she believed Trump made a decision to authorize her to be a special counsel of some nature. The following day, she called the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, saying she needed office space and a security clearance as the new special counsel. Meadows did not refute Powell’s claim but told her he was working on logistics, and then called Giuliani to tell him Powell was trying to secure another audience with Trump. Giuliani told Meadows that Trump had barred Powell from the White House. But while Meadows and other advisers had refused to grant Powell a “hard pass” that would have allowed her unfettered access to the complex, she returned to the White House on Sunday and Monday with documents on alleged Iranian threats to US election websites. Meadows had revoked Ziegler’s access to the system for permitting White House access but Powell was cleared on a temporary “appointment” pass by another aide. She was, however, blocked from meeting the former president.",News/US news,Revealed: Trump reviewed draft order that authorized voting machines to be seized,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/04/trump-draft-order-voting-machines-white-house-meeting
2/5/2022,"It can be tricky to find a winter family holiday that ticks all the boxes for everyone – somewhere young children can be entertained, teenagers can have fun, make friends and be semi-independent, and everyone can enjoy some family time together while also (especially the parents) finding time to relax, alone or as a couple. When my children were small, my main requirements from a winter holiday were that there was no cooking and cleaning to be done, and someone would help out with the kids at least some of the time. I’d also hope for good food, the occasional cocktail, activities for all and, if there was a spa and pool available, so much the better.  Many parents, like me, want to spend time with their children on holiday while also having some time to themselves. They want luxury accommodation designed with families in mind and a break from dealing with life’s day-to-day organisation. Children generally want to have fun both with their parents and with kids of their own age, with plenty of activities on tap. For me, a ski break in the French Alps delivers all of the above. It also creates really special bonding moments. I don’t know whether it’s the adrenaline from all the outdoor exertion, the sublime mountain views or the indulgent food – or all three – that puts everyone in such good spirits. Then there’s the fact that many resorts in the French Alps, such as La Rosière, Grand Massif Samoëns Morillon and Alpe d’Huez, cater for skiers of different abilities, and offer plenty of fun activities for non-skiers too – making them a good choice for families. My first ski holiday with children was when they were just six months and two years old – a very different experience to the “do what you want, when you want” ski holidays of pre-parenthood. On-site childcare we could trust was an absolute must – we wanted to be able to make the most of the mountains and the children were obviously too young to ski. It was fabulous to get out and about by ourselves, while also knowing the kids were happy and in safe hands before we came back to collect them to take them sledging or to build snowmen. Skiing with your children once they are old enough can be a beautiful, bonding experience (although actually teaching them is usually best left to experts who are adept at making the experience fun and stress-free). It’s incredibly exciting to see them making their first turns and showing off what they’ve learned that morning in the jardin des neige, and then, when they are a little older, exploring the mountains together. Small children love the magical wonder of the snow, the fun of learning something new, the exciting sensations of sledging and snowball fights and the thrill of receiving their first Piou Piou badge to commemorate what they learned in ski school that week. Teens love the thrill of speed (especially overtaking their parents!), mastering new skills, and the opportunity to try a range of mountain activities. Skiing is something the whole family can enjoy together, from tiny toddlers mastering their snowplough to almost-independent teens mastering moguls and jumps. There aren’t that many activities that can keep an entire family happy – but skiing is certainly one of them. When it comes to accommodation, an all-inclusive holiday package can make budgeting easy and life simple. At Club Med, almost everything is included, from travel, kids’ clubs (for those aged four and above), lift passes and ski lessons, to premium drinks, snacks and gourmet meals, usually with a choice of restaurants. So you’ll know exactly what your trip will cost in advance, with no surprise hidden extras and no tedious signing for drinks or totting up bills. One of the most popular Club Med resorts for families is Les Arcs Panorama, a ski-in, ski-out location set at 1,750 metres in one of the largest ski areas in the world, Paradiski in the French Alps. It offers kids’ clubs for all ages from four months to 17 years (at no extra cost for those aged four and above). Ski lessons are included so children can learn to ski or snowboard, or improve their technique with ESF guides. Older children can join the Teen Snow Sports Programme, learning to ski moguls, slalom through the trees or perfect their powder skills. In the evenings, they can enjoy discos or watch a film. If you really want to up the luxury then opt for Club Med’s new and first exclusive collection ski resort in Val d’Isère, which holidaymakers can now book for winter 22/23. Set right on the pistes with interiors designed by Parisian designers Studio Marc Hertrich and Nicolas Adnet, all rooms include a lounge area and the main restaurant is chalet-style. Other features include an indoor pool, yoga school by Heberson Oliveira, room service, private transfers and champagne served from 6pm – the ultimate luxurious ski experience.

2/5/2022,"My body clock always wakes me up early and there’s no better start to a day of skiing than to watch the sunrise. In the French Alps, watching the sunrise feels like the ultimate indulgence. As pink turns to orange over snow-capped mountain peaks, everywhere is still and quiet. The higher you are in the mountains, the better. If there’s time, I usually try to warm up with 20 minutes of yoga. My favourite is sun salutations, mat facing the window. The movement warms up my body and mind, switching on core muscles (ideal for skiing) and gently stretching out any stiffness from the previous day.  It’s the perfect, mindful ritual to kick off a day on the slopes, to really notice the mountains before the day of fun begins. Breakfast is crucial if you want to maximise your day. Without it you’ll find energy levels will start to drop by mid-morning, regardless of how much coffee you’ve had. I find fruit and yoghurt with nuts and seeds, followed by eggs for a protein boost, is the ideal start to my day of skiing – although a pain au chocolat often finds its way on to my plate, too. I plan my day using a piste map or the resort app – where to go, where to stop, which runs to ski. If some of your group or family are in ski school, arrange a midday meeting point before you set out, so everyone knows what they are doing in case a phone dies or a splinter group emerges. If it’s your first day, try to organise your ski equipment the day before, so you can get straight on to the pistes in the morning. There’s nothing more frustrating than spending the first few hours of your holiday chasing around after the right pair of boots or skis. A physiotherapist once told me that the best warm-up for skiing is walking to the lifts, so try to walk all the way there or get off the resort shuttle bus a stop early and make your way there on foot. If you’re staying in a ski-in, ski-out hotel (such as Club Med’s resorts in La Rosière, Grand Massif Samoëns Morillon and Val Thorens), take the stairs to breakfast or the ski boot room. Or warm up with a class in Club Med’s yoga school, where the programme has been created by renowned yoga teacher Heberson Oliveira. Then you’re out in the fresh air, clipping on the skis and taking your first run on perfect corduroy, freshly groomed snow. Take it slowly at first and practise every kind of turn you will use throughout the day – short turns to long, carving turns, warming up your muscles and getting your brain into the zone. I like to stop for a hot chocolate or coffee on the mountain at mid-morning for a refuel. Mountain huts are full of character, as are their owners. Lunch on the slopes is a highlight, but I try not to eat too much. If you overeat at lunch, your body starts to use a lot of energy in digesting food, which can make your legs feel wobbly. If you’re enjoying lunch outside in the sunshine, keep topped up with sunscreen – make sure you use at least SPF30. If you still have some energy, skiing until the lifts close is a must and slopes start to get less crowded as the day wears on. My favourite trick is to enjoy a hot chocolate, or cheeky vin chaud, at the highest restaurant in the resort and wait until the crowds clear before skiing down as the sun starts to set. It gets chilly, but is worth the effort as the mountains take on a magical aura at sunset. Just make sure you don’t miss the last lift back. There may be more restrictions on après this year due to Covid, but toasting the memories of another fantastic day of skiing is a must. Why not hop into a hot tub or, if you’re staying at a Club Med resort, relax your muscles with a swim in a heated pool – there’s no better way to wind down and soothe tired legs. Finally, indulge in a hearty supper – you’ve earned it! If you’re going for a cheese fondue or raclette, eat slowly – there’s always a time lag on feeling full and all of a sudden you can feel uncomfortably full (we’ve all done it). I’m such a ski purist that I love an early night, sinking into my duvet with a book and cup of hot water – at altitude it’s important to keep hydrated. If you can get between seven and nine hours’ sleep, the ideal number of hours according to experts, you’ll be fresh and raring to go skiing the next day. And what can be better than waking up to watch the sunrise in the mountains before a day of skiing? Nothing, as far as I’m concerned.

2/5/2022,"It’s that time of the year again, when I sit down with my planner and laptop, searching for the perfect winter getaway with the hope to blast away those February blues – and this year, I’m dreaming of snowy vistas and alpine forests. Yearning for those mesmerising blanket-of-snow views and the gloriously cosy après-ski atmosphere, the obvious choice of holiday would be a ski break in the French Alps. Only, I’m not a natural skier. The two times I agreed to go skiing with friends, I had to be coaxed down the red runs by a mate, who patiently held my hand the whole way. I just couldn’t shake my worry around falling. So I decided that skiing wasn’t for me.  But while skiing isn’t for me, ski holidays very much are. In fact, I love everything about a ski break – other than the actual skiing. For a start, it’s the perfect opportunity for my group of friends to enjoy some quality time together while getting plenty of fresh air. Val-d’Isère is one of my favourite regions, simply for its maze of cable car and chairlift experiences. During previous trips, I often found myself gasping with excitement as the ground faded beneath my feet and the cable car slowly climbed to dizzying heights, revealing enthralling views of a vast white carpet peppered with Lego-style spruce trees. While the others would take on the black runs, I’d usually spend afternoons tinkering around in village shops looking for hand-created arts and crafts, chatting to the market stallholders and stopping off at cosy cafes for a frothy hot chocolate. My favourite times, however, were when everyone reconvened in the early evening – showered and warm, we would sit around the fire in the après-ski bar sharing anecdotes from our widely varied days. Then we’d enjoy a well-earned sharing pot of gruyère fondue, steaming in its creamy, irresistible goodness. On other nights, a short walk to a restaurant in town would often lead us to more local flavours. We’d spend hours storytelling and reminiscing over fresh steak tartare, a light tartiflette, or raclette – for me, the most delicious food in the world. It couldn’t be any more perfect. The good news for the non-skiers among us is that there are holiday packages, such as those created by Club Med, whose wide range of activities and amenities allow everyone to indulge equally in the regional beauty. The high-altitude resort of Club Med Val Thorens, for example, is home to a luxury Sothys spa offering massages and a whirlpool bath with a stunning view of the mountains – exactly what you need after spending the day tramping through the snow. Club Med’s all-inclusive holidays often include gyms, fitness classes and heated pools – so you can get active without a pair of skis – while lively après-ski entertainment provides fun for every kind of guest. If you’re not a skier but still crave outdoor action and adventure, there are plenty of exciting alternatives in the French Alps. From open-air ice skating to snowmobiling, anyone can now enjoy the stunning views that, previously, could only be experienced by skiers. Here are five of the most alluring options: Snow mountain biking in Val ThorensProving that these snowy hills aren’t just for the skiers and snowboarders, Val Thorens’ adrenaline-filled mountain biking experience is a thrilling way to experience the region’s wintery beauty. Specialised bikes with studded tyres can be hired at Club Med, and cyclists are free to explore the 370 miles of slopes across the glorious Three Valleys ski area before they open and after they close. Bobsleighing in La PlagneHome to France’s only bobsleigh track, La Plagne’s famous circuit was built in 1992 for the Winter Olympics. Today, the 1,500-metre frozen track is open to the public and takes willing participants up to speeds of 120km/h. Anyone is welcome to undertake a solo run or form a group for a team challenge. Ice skating in TignesGliding through the snow on a pair of skis is certainly not the only way to take in the pristine landscape of the Tignes resort. A frozen lake is an 800-square-metre ice rink, providing winter fun for visitors of all ages. Admission is complimentary with a ski pass and skaters can hire boots upon arrival at the lake. Any brave souls keen to explore what goes on below the ice can embark on an ice-diving adventure, too. Nordic and snowshoe walking in ValmorelExploring the natural forests of the picture-perfect Aigueblanche valleys by foot is perhaps one of the most therapeutic activities to enjoy at this time of the year. Nordic walking (included in the price of Club Med holidays) is the practice of a mindful hike – typically with poles – and is perfect for a full-body workout. Snowshoeing involves wearing specialised footwear that spreads the walker’s weight over a large surface area, allowing them to venture into untouched snow-covered paths. Snowmobiling in Val ThorensNot many holidaymakers get the chance to explore the Alps under a starry night sky. In Val Thorens, the best way to do this is by snowmobile, carving your own path through the untouched snow while winding through the spruce trees. Guests at Club Med have the option to pay a little extra to sign up to one of three guided daily departures, typically leaving between 5:30pm and 8pm.

2/5/2022,"Alpe d’Huez – a great all-round family resortLocated high on a sunny plateau in the centre of the French Alps, the thriving resort of Alpe d’Huez has some of France’s best snow conditions for downhill and off-piste skiing.

It is part of the massive skiable terrain known as Les 3 Vallées, where there are more than 600km of runs and enough space that you never have to ski the same run twice during a week’s holiday. The resort is good for advanced skiers, and the fun atmosphere is perfect for groups and couples. Before leaving Val Thorens, try the zip line from the top of the Bouchet chairlift in Orelle (3,230 metres), which whizzes down the mountain to the Funitel de Thorens in Val Thorens. Stay: Stay at the chic Club Med Val Thorens, where keen climbers can scale the impressive indoor climbing wall, or relax over wine-tasting and exotic cocktails at the Oxygen bar. Les Arcs – enjoy beautiful forest runsSituated in the Tarentaise valley of Savoie, the resort of Les Arcs has long been popular with UK skiers.

The all-inclusive kids’ club offers young skiers lessons with Ecole du ski Français (ESF) professionals. Tignes and Val d’Isère – Fantastic après skiLinked by a network of fast-moving lifts, Tignes and Val d’Isère are in the Savoie region of France and share the vast Val d’Isère-Tignes ski area, where there is 300km of snow-covered terrain to explore. It’s a good choice for early season skiing that’s suitable for all levels. Considered one of the birthplaces of alpine skiing, Val d’Isère (known as “Val” to locals) is also home to some of the most famous après ski and clubbing hotspot in the Alps. Stay: Club Med will open two new locations this year – one in Tignes and the other in Val d’Isère – and guests can now book for the 2022 and 2023 season. Club Med has been in Tignes since 1958 but, in December 2022, the new Tignes 4T family flagship will open its doors at 2,100 metres in the heart of Tignes Val Claret village.
