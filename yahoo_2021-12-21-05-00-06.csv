12/21/2021,"Zappos founder Tony Hsieh didn't leave a will when he died after a house fire in Dec. 2020. His friends and family are reportedly going head to head over how to divvy up his $500 million estate. Some are filing claims in court with sticky notes written with Hsieh promising financial deals. Zappos founder Tony Hsieh, who died in Dec. 2020, didn't leave a will detailing what he wanted to do with his estate and fortune, valued at $500 million. And so friends and family are now grappling with how to divvy up his empire, with some insisting they're owed millions of dollars, real-estate development contrast, and other assets. As The Wall Street Journal reported Monday, Hsieh jotted down specifics of some business deals on sticky notes, thousands of which were also strewn across the walls of his Park City, Utah, home. Some survivors are filing claims in court based on those sticky notes, including Mark Evensvold, who filed a claim for $30 million based on one that was written three months before Hsieh died. The note, per the Journal, said Hsieh would pay Evensvold $450,000 to move to Park City and take up a project manager position and give him a 20% share in a restaurant business. His family looks poised to inherit his assets, although relatives and friends are at war over who cares for Hsieh and who aimed to be close to him for his wealth and status, per the Journal. Some told the court that relatives, including Hsieh's brother Andy, enabled the former CEO's abuse of drugs and alcohol. On the other hand, his family said in court filings that Hsieh's friends pushed him to make ""impulsive"" and ""incoherent investments."" Actors Joseph Gordon Levitt and David Arquette, who were both friends with Hsieh per The Journal, were also subpoenaed for evidence that the two men were concerned about his mental health. Representatives for the Hsieh family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hsieh left his role as Zappos CEO in August 2020 after 20 years with the company. He was known for his out-of-the-box workplace policies, including the practice of ""Holacracy,"" a system with a flat work hierarchy that allows employees to work without assigned roles and more flexibility. He also pioneered the concept of paying new, unhappy employees $2,000 to quit to weed out those who wouldn't be as committed to and passionate about their work at Zappos. But in 2020, Hsieh began struggling more so with drugs and alcohol, a battle exacerbated by the isolation and social distancing of the COVID-19 pandemic. He died after sustaining injuries in a Connecticut house fire in December 2020. Forbes later found that he had locked himself in a storage area in the home, and while investigators ruled out criminal intent, they concluded the fire could have been ""caused by carelessness or an intentional act by Mr. Hsieh.""

12/21/2021,"A toxic and stormy relationship ended in Sean Barnes and his ex-girlfriend, Brooke Tuchinksy, meeting in a North Miami diner in August 2013. They argued. She walked away into the bathroom. Barnes followed, shot her in the face and then tried to claim self-defense — even though she was unarmed. A jury rejected his self-defense claim in October, and on Monday, a Miami-Dade judge sentenced Barnes to 35 years in prison, plus 20 years of probation when he’s released. The bullet barely missed her brain. “It was just fate, providence, luck that you did not kill Miss Tuchinksy. Because you tried to,” Circuit Judge Miguel de la O said during a sentencing hearing on Monday. The sentencing capped a long-running legal saga for Barnes, who has been awaiting trial for nearly a decade on a charge of attempted murder with a firearm. He sought freedom under Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” law, which has been criticized for fostering trigger-happy vigilante justice, and giving killers a way to beat murder charges. ‘The law eliminated a citizen’s duty to retreat before resorting to using deadly force. He and Tuchinksy had a relationship marred by mutual allegations of domestic abuse. On Monday, Tuchinsky recalled Barnes breaking into her home, attacking her, body shaming and threatening her. “Many victims do not get the opportunity to speak because they do not make it through the abuse,” she told the judge. “It was a close call for me.” The close call came at the Denny’s on Biscayne Boulevard and Northeast 121st Street, where the two met. Barnes claimed that Tuchinsky had sent a slew of text messages, using racial slurs against him, while insisting they meet to answer questions for “real closure.” At Denny’s, they got into a heated argument inside the restaurant and had to be separated by employees. She left to the bathroom while Barnes remained eating at the table. But then he followed her inside the bathroom and shot her in the jaw. Barnes, who testified at trial, later claimed he saw her reaching for her purse and retrieve a “shiny object” he believed was some sort of weapon. Jurors didn’t buy it, although they did not find he acted with premeditation. “He managed to shoot her in the face with a .45 and she managed to walk, crawl out of the bathroom alive,” said Miami-Dade Assistant State Attorney Amy Drever. “It was just her luck where he shot her in the face, it did not go into her brain.” Barnes declined to speak at Monday’s sentencing. The state asked for life in prison. His defense attorney, Fallon Zirpoli, asked for 25 years — the minimum mandatory sentence under Florida law — saying he could still contribute to society, as evidenced by his behavior in jail since his arrest. “He was for intents and purposes a model inmate,” Zirpoli said. Judge de la O wasn’t sold on the most lenient sentencing — but also didn’t think he deserved the max. Barnes could be released when he is in his mid-70s, the judge said. “I wasn’t necessarily convinced you went there to murder Ms. Tuchinsky. Something happened at the table. Something made you snap,” the judge said. “Clearly unjustified. But I don’t believe you went there with the intent to murder her. If I believed that, I would sentenced you to life in prison. You have a chance to get out. You’ll have some sort of life left. It’ll be up to you what you make of it.”",U.S./Miami Herald,"A Miami domestic abuser shot his ex in the face, claimed self-defense.

12/21/2021,"Some neighborhood deer are doing more than just laughing and calling Rudolph names this holiday season. A Rudolph-looking lawn decoration in Fort Nelson, British Columbia has become the target of bullying by young bucks that seem to mistake it for a real animal — and a likely rival competing for attention from female deer, CBC reported. The Christmas decoration is actually a 3D archery target made to look like a whitetail deer, UPI reported. It also has a bright red light bulb on its nose. Arlene Chmelyk, who lives in the home where Rudolph resides, shared a video on Facebook of a young deer interacting with the decoration. The deer seems to glare at Rudolph from a distance before slowly approaching him. He gets momentarily spooked and jumps away, but then slowly circles the Rudolph decoration. Finally, amid the red glow of Rudolph’s nose, he gives the decoration an aggressive headbutt, toppling it over, before he bounds away into the snow. The buck might be especially aggressive around this time of year because it’s “rutting season,” or a period of time when deer and other animals approach their breeding season. A common rutting behavior is sparring among bucks, which might help the deer establish a dominance hierarchy among males, according to the Noble Research Institute. Chmelyk told CBC that her family plans to bring the decoration back year after year, even if the local deer never catch on. “I’m like, he has a bright red nose,” she said. “I’m not really sure what they see.” The results are in: This is the ultimate holiday cookie, according to South Carolinians ‘Most amazing Christmas gift’: Habitat brings a Rock Hill mom home for the holidays After 3 weeks in ICU, Arkansas man back home after fall while hanging Christmas lights",World/Bellingham Herald mcclatchy articles,"Deer keep getting into fights with this Rudolph lawn ornament, video from Canada shows",https://news.yahoo.com/deer-keep-getting-fights-rudolph-175515902.html
12/21/2021,"A Dallas Police Mounted Unit stand outside of the old First Dallas Baptist church as Trump supporters and members wait in line for Sunday morning service with former President Donald Trump, on Sunday, Dec. 19, 2021 in downtown Dallas. Credit - Ben Torres Before Donald Trump had spoken a word Sunday, Dec. 19, at First Baptist Dallas it would’ve been understandable if those in attendance had trouble remembering the “reason for the season.” Jesus was celebrated, yes. But the entire Christmas service was built around Trump’s advent: lines wrapped around the building starting 3 hours before the event; security screening for everyone in the main sanctuary; Trump’s smiling face on every program. The former President was introduced or acknowledged four separate times during the service, each one to thunderous applause. Senior Pastor Robert Jeffress, frequent Fox News guest and longtime Trump advocate, gushed with adulation for his “good friend,” a friendship he proudly counted as “one of the greatest privileges of my life.” He twice called President Trump “the most pro-life, pro-religious liberty, pro-Israel President in the history of our great country” and dubbed him “the most consequential President since Abraham Lincoln.” Trump even found his way into Jeffress’s sermon as an analogy for God himself. When Jeffress wanted to illustrate what it meant for God to pardon sin through Christ, he recalled Trump pardoning Alice Johnson in the Oval Office. And finally, there was in Jeffress’s own words, “the climax of the service,” Trump’s “Christmas Greeting” that turned into a MAGA rally. The delivery and content were classic Trump, alternating between off-the-cuff rambling about the nation’s dystopic situation and remarks about Christmas that he confessed were written for him. He concluded with his signature “Make America Great Again” sign off and even began a chant for “USA! USA!” Attending the event in person allowed me to appreciate how central Trump remains to white evangelicalism. Not just for Robert Jeffress, Trump’s most loyal “court evangelical.” Not just for First Baptist Dallas, the church that once wrote and performed a hymn for Trump entitled “Make America Great Again.” In fact, it would be a mistake for readers to roll their eyes at an event like this and dismiss it as “wacky” or “fringe.” On the contrary, what I observed in person Sunday morning, as well as what we can see from national survey data, make clear how Trump has conformed white evangelicalism to his own image, and why so many evangelicals await his second advent. Standing in line 2.5 hours before the event, I chatted with a group of five elderly women who all came together. All were committed churchgoers in the Dallas area, but none were members at First Baptist. They simply came to see Trump. And they were planning to all get tickets for the event with Bill O’Reilly at the American Airlines Center later that afternoon where Trump would also be speaking. There was Bill, a repairman who had taken public transportation to get to First Baptist. He was not a member either, but had always been a huge fan of Trump and was eager to see him in person. He is unvaccinated because he didn’t trust the science, heard the vaccines caused blood clots, and read somewhere the Omicron variant wasn’t that bad anyway. He was also convinced the election was stolen and said he would vote for Trump again in 2024. And there was Carlos. Like Bill, Carlos was visiting First Baptist from elsewhere in the city along with a friend. And also like Bill, Carlos was certain the election had been stolen from Trump. But Carlos didn’t think Americans should wait for the 2024 election. Speaking to his friend loud enough for all to hear, Carlos explained “Trump should be reinstated and made President for life. Because he should be for life.” Trump’s appeal Sunday morning extends far beyond the First Baptist faithful. Evangelical visitors from around the city had come to cheer for their President. They were convinced he’d been treated unfairly. And they pined to see him back in office. National data show us this is not a fringe view among white evangelicals. In survey data my colleagues and I collected in August 2021 and are currently analyzing, over two-thirds of white evangelicals felt the 2020 election had been stolen from Trump. And 63% believe the liberal media wildly exaggerated the threat of COVID-19 to damage Trump’s chances at re-election. Nor do white evangelicals blame Trump for the attempted insurrection at the Capitol Building on January 6th. As of August 2021, a full 70% disagree that Trump held any responsibility for the event. For the vast majority of white evangelicals in the U.S., like those visiting First Baptist Dallas on Sunday, Trump is still their warrior. And his promises are still the same as those he made as a candidate in 2016: that he would fight for Christians like them. Introducing the former President, Jeffress recounted what initially attracted him to Trump as a candidate in 2015 was that Trump passionately defended the Christmas holiday and promised to make it politically correct to say “Merry Christmas” again. The narrative of a politically correct “war on Christmas” is a farcical right-wing trope that goes back decades, but Trump was able to leverage this narrative to present himself as a candidate who would fight for Christian culture. That’s how he presented himself on Sunday. Recalling how Jeffress first described him to others, Trump paraphrased Jeffress: “[Trump] may not know the Bible as well as all of us, but he loves God, he loves Jesus, and he’s a leader, and he’s going to lead us into great things, in helping and saving Christianity.” What did he mean by “saving Christianity”? He means rescuing Christianity’s influence, and more specifically the cultural and political influence of white conservative Christians. Trump’s appeal to white evangelicals at First Baptist church and around the country is primarily the result of what we call “Christian nationalism,” the belief that America has been and should always be for “Christians like us.” Trump reassured listeners Sunday of the centrality of Christianity to America’s story and his commitment to defend that centrality. Reading his remarks, Trump exclaimed, “It’s impossible to think of the life of our own country without the influence of [Jesus’] example and of his teachings. Our miraculous founding, overcoming civil war, abolishing slavery, defeating communism and fascism, reaching boundless heights of science and discovering so many incredible things…And the United States ultimately becoming a truly great nation and we’re gonna keep it that way. We’re not going to let it go.” That is the promise of MAGA. It’s the reason the vast majority of white evangelicals elevate Trump and what his possible return as President means for the future of the country. As Trump slowly walked off stage, he began a chant of “USA! USA!” throughout the First Baptist audience. What viewers online could not hear was the small group of attendees next to me in the back of the sanctuary who changed the chant into, “We love you! We love you! We love you!” They weren’t chanting to Jesus. They were chanting to their savior.",Politics/Time,How Trump Stole Christmas—And Why Evangelicals Rally to Their Savior,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-stole-christmas-why-evangelicals-165933539.html
