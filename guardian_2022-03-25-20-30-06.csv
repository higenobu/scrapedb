3/25/2022,"The Russia-focused mining company Petropavlovsk has said it is unable to offload its gold or repay a loan because of the inclusion of Gazprombank on the UK’s sanctions list after the invasion of Ukraine. Shares in the London-listed company tumbled by a fifth in early trading on Friday after Petropavlovsk revealed it was “urgently” assessing its business operations and financing arrangements as a result. “The group has substantial commercial and financial relationships with Gazprombank and its subsidiaries,” said Petropavlovsk, whose market value has fallen by more than 90% since the invasion last month. “The company is urgently considering with its advisers the implications for the group’s activities and financing arrangements resulting from Gazprombank being designated for the purpose of an asset freeze.” The FTSE 250 company said its relationship with Gazprombank included a $200m loan, a $86.7m revolving credit facility and it had been forced to halt a $560,000 interest payment due on Friday. The financial relationship also means Gazprombank acts as an “off-taker of 100% of the group’s gold production”. “Gazprombank’s designation under regulations for the purposes of asset freeze prohibits further sales of gold by the group to Gazprombank at present,” the company said. “Restrictions on purchasing and selling gold in Russia may make it challenging to find an alternative purchaser for the group’s gold output.” Petropavlovsk, which said none of its subsidiaries faced any sanctions from the EU, UK, US or other countries, plans to make another announcement in due course. This month, the Russian billionaire Sergey Sudarikov, who part-owns the sanctioned Credit Bank of Moscow, bought a 29% stake in Petropavlovsk. Sudarikov, who is behind the Region financial group, bought the stake from Konstantin Strukov, who owns the gold miner UGC, and is the largest shareholder in the company. Petropavlovsk was founded as Peter Hambro Mining in 1994.

3/25/2022,"A woman is receiving specialist treatment for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in London after travelling to central Asia, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said. The viral disease is usually transmitted by ticks and livestock animals in countries where it is endemic. It is only the third time a case has ever been identified in the UK. The patient was diagnosed at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS foundation trust, and is now receiving specialist care at the Royal free hospital in London. Dr Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at the UKHSA, said the virus “does not spread easily between people and the overall risk to the public is very low”. Two cases were reported in 2012 and 2014, neither of which spread. Hopkins said the agency was working to contact people who were in close contact with the woman to assess them and provide advice. She added: “UKHSA and the NHS have well-established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed.” According to the World Health Organization, about 30% of patients die, usually in the second week of infection. For those who recover, improvement generally begins on the ninth or 10th day after the onset of illness. Symptoms of the virus come on suddenly and include fever, muscle ache, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and sensitivity to light. Early on, people can also experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and a sore throat, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. Other signs include a rash in the mouth and throat, fast heart rate and enlarged lymph nodes. Dr Sir Michael Jacobs, a consultant in infectious diseases at the Royal Free London NHS foundation trust, said: “The Royal Free hospital is a specialist centre for treating patients with viral infections such as Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever. “Our high-level isolation unit is run by an expert team of doctors, nurses, therapists and laboratory staff and is designed to ensure we can safely treat patients with these kinds of infections.” A type of tick known as Hyalomma tick is the main carrier. These are not established in the UK and the virus has never been detected in a tick in the country. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, affected ticks are found in north Africa, Asia, and southern and eastern Europe.",News/Science,Woman in UK diagnosed with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/25/woman-in-uk-diagnosed-with-crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever
3/25/2022,"The UK’s pub culture and its traditions of brewing and distilling, from London gin to Scotch whisky, have long made drinks a significant international export, and it’s an industry in which entrepreneurs can still thrive today. So what does it take to develop a new British drinks brand, whether alcoholic or not, and then get the rest of the world excited about it? We met three small and medium-sized UK businesses to find out. “I don’t think we have to put a daffodil on our cans to be an iconic Welsh brand,” says Joelle Drummond, founder of Drop Bear Beer Co, a Swansea-based producer of non-alcoholic (0.3-0.5% ABV) craft beer. “The most important thing for us is the taste: and we have a great tasting product. We want to create sustainable Welsh jobs, use Welsh ingredients where we can, and support communities. We’re a Welsh business and we’re proud – but we don’t want to be limited to only selling our product here.” Drummond co-founded Drop Bear with her girlfriend, Sarah McNena, who is Australian. (A “drop bear”, by the way, is a fictional breed of carnivorous koala that Australians delight in warning tourists about. “I personally believed it for about four months!” sighs Drummond.) Their products have won more than 20 prizes, including Great Taste awards, and the company is B Corp certified, meaning that it meets high, verified standards for sustainability. The pair took a leap of faith by quitting their jobs as project managers, Drummond with a translation agency and McNena in local government, and sinking their savings into Drop Bear in 2019. The idea for creating nonalcoholic beers with the depth of flavour and quirky graphics of craft beer had occurred to them three years earlier when they were taking a break from drinking. “In places that had the coolest beers you can imagine, we’d be offered orange juice or coffee,” says Drummond. “We couldn’t get a craft beer that was alcohol-free.” Proudly Welsh but designed from the start to be scalable, Drop Bear’s range is now available as far afield as New Zealand After market research and successful experiments making non-alcoholic homebrew, Drummond sought out a professional brewer. “I took him our recipes and made sure that they were commercially scalable. We wanted something you could sell in a supermarket.” Drop Bear’s range is now available not only across the UK but also in Spain, the Netherlands, Finland, Australia and New Zealand. “We started exporting our beers during the pandemic,” says Drummond. “It was a way for us to expand when a lot of retailers were not reviewing their product offerings.” Approached by wholesalers and distributors in overseas markets, Drummond and McNena needed to make decisions about which to partner with. “We had a lot of detailed conversations to establish whether a partnership was going to be right for us,” says Drummond. “We also had to really look at individual country requirements for labelling, as different markets need different things.” The Welsh government supported the brand in identifying “quick wins” and longer-term export goals. Drop Bear has raised financing to build the UK’s largest brewery making solely non-alcoholic drinks, which is due to open this September. “We want to compete with the big boys,” says Drummond. “And we want to be here for the long run.” One company to have already achieved that goal is Beyond the Bean, which was founded by Jem and Nikki Rogers in 1997. The Bristol-based company specialises in syrups, smoothies and frappes for the coffee trade and it also has its own brand of flavoured teas. Jem Rogers: ‘Spend time with customers and contacts’ The business came into being after the Rogers spent time running a mobile coffee business and spotted a gap in the market. “We started selling to brands that were niche at the time, like the first Coffee Republic and the first couple of Costa Coffee shops,” says managing director Jem. “They grew massively over a short period, and we were fortunate to be one of the key suppliers who were there from the start.” The company now supplies high-street chains and independent cafes, bars, hotels and restaurants around the world. Beyond the Bean’s growth strategy has successfully tied in with the international nature of the coffee industry Still independent and owner-run, Beyond the Bean’s casual dress code and non-hierarchical culture sit easily over the professionalism that has seen the business grow to nearly 50 employees, and sell its products in 42 countries. Conrad Whiteley, the company’s international sales manager, oversees its export strategy. “I meet regularly with our adviser at the Department for International Trade (DIT), who will make us aware of new initiatives, like grants, trade missions or opportunities at global exhibitions,” he says. “We have a quarterly review, where we can look at markets we’d like to enter and tell him where we’re finding trade barriers. He has also advised us on product development.” One of the ways Beyond the Bean has chosen distributors, such as coffee wholesalers, is with the aid of on-the-ground DIT contacts, who help perform due diligence. The department also supported the company to exhibit and make contacts at Gulfood, a major trade fair in Dubai, from which it was able to win new business and expand across the Middle East. “The single biggest factor in us being successful abroad is finding the right partner,” says Jem. “Our team travel a lot, we’re at the events we need to be at, and we spend a lot of time with our customers and contacts. The coffee industry has an international nature, and a lot of owner-led businesses – and it’s also a lot of fun.” Simon Erlanger: ‘You have to be on the ball with the paperwork’ Another business making inroads in international markets is the Isle of Harris Distillery, in the Outer Hebrides. Simon Erlanger, the managing director, recalls the winter of early 2015, when construction of the distillery was nearing completion. “We had the worst storms in living memory,” he says. “Wind speeds of over 100mph, when we were putting the roof on. But the distillery survived, and we thought that was a good omen. If we could weather that one, we could weather any storm. And it’s been a success story.” While the business will eventually be a whisky distillery, the inaugural product is a premium gin with a distinctly local character: it gets its maritime botanical notes from the infusion of sugar kelp, a seaweed which is harvested by hand from the waters around the island by a single diver. The distillery was the idea of its founder, Anderson Bakewell, “an Anglo-American who bought an island off the coast of Harris half a century ago”, says Erlanger. “In that time, he saw the population of Harris go from about 4,000 to less than 2,000, as young people left to look for work and didn’t return. And he wanted to do something about it. The Isle of Harris Distillery belies its size, with its premium kelp-infused gin now reaching 23 international markets “We knew this was going to be a challenge, because building a distillery on a remote island costs a huge amount more than it would do on the mainland,” Erlanger says of the project, for which he helped to raise £11m through a combination of private investors and public funding. One aim was to create 25 sustainable jobs for local people (in a community where the working-age population is only about 700); in 2022, Isle of Harris Distillery is already employing 40 people, and set to grow. Another aim was to generate employment indirectly, by boosting tourism to the island, which is best known for its Harris tweed fabric. Exporting was always going to be key for a craft distillery in such a tiny locale, and Erlanger and his team have succeeded in getting Isle of Harris Gin into 23 international markets. For some of the most significant markets, Erlanger says, the distillery benefited from the assistance of DIT. “In North America DIT was particularly helpful,” he says. “They organised press events to promote us. They’ve been very good at championing us and have stayed in close contact. They can also advise on issues like paperwork.” Getting things right in that part of the world was crucial, says Erlanger. “The US is the world’s largest market for premium gin, and Canada is in the top five and growing fast.” The brand’s sales have grown 40% in the last two years, and the Chinese market – “as yet under-developed [for gin], but growing quickly from a small base” – is next on the cards for the company. “We absolutely don’t want to be in every supermarket,” says Erlanger. “But we wanted to capture something of this beautiful island in a bottle and send it out to the world.” To find out more about getting started with exporting goods and services, and what resources are available for your business, visit great.gov.uk",Going global with business,Taste of success: how British drinks brands are broadening their horizons,https://www.theguardian.com/going-global-with-business/2022/mar/25/taste-of-success-how-british-drinks-brands-are-broadening-their-horizons
3/25/2022,"Joe Biden has agreed a landmark energy supply deal with the EU under which the US will increase transatlantic gas deliveries, in the hope of weakening the power the Kremlin wields thanks to its natural resources. Speaking in Brussels after the deal was agreed on Friday, the US president said Vladimir Putin exploited Russia’s status as Europe’s main supplier of gas to “coerce and manipulate his neighbours” and that the proceeds of gas and oil sales “drive his war machine”. He said the partnership with the EU would strip Putin of that weapon by reducing Europe’s dependence on Russian energy, as well as the continent’s overall gas demand. Under the plan, the US and other nations will increase exports of seaborne liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe by 15bn cubic meters this year. Even larger shipment volumes would be delivered in the future, he promised. At the same time, the EU would try to keep climate goals on track by powering gas infrastructure with clean energy and reducing methane leaks that could worsen global warming. Biden said such a step was not “only the right thing to do from a moral standpoint” but “it’s going to put us on a stronger strategic footing”. The initiative would probably require Europe to build new terminals for importing LNG, with current infrastructure unable to cope with a significant rise in imports. Germany, Europe’s largest economy, has no LNG terminals. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said it was important for Europe to shift away from Russia towards more reliable and friendly suppliers. “We aim to reduce this dependence on Russian fossil fuels and get rid of it,” she said. Russian energy is a key source of income and political leverage for Moscow. Almost 40% of the EU’s natural gas comes from Russia to heat homes, generate electricity and power industry. Biden was due to leave Brussels after the announcement and head to Rzeszów, in Poland, where US troops are based, about an hour’s drive from the Ukrainian border.",News/US news,Biden and EU agree landmark gas deal to break Kremlin’s hold ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/25/biden-and-eu-agree-landmark-gas-deal-to-break-kremlin-hold
3/25/2022,"Ifirst noticed Aesop’s little amber bottles popping up in smart restaurants and hotel rooms a few years ago: they were glass ambassadors from a faraway country of refined, futuristic beauty products. Then I spotted them on The Modern House website (and occasionally on Howdens furniture catalogue), positioned next to brick-tile showers and Belfast sinks. By spring 2020, the bottles were everywhere, the little vials of its Post-Poo Drops (designed to mask bad odours) in the loo shorthand for a certain kind of domestic sophistication. The Aesop bathroom was in a house with Veja trainers in the hallway, Torres crisps in the cupboard and an Alison Roman pasta dish warming in an Our Place pan on the stove. Like Diptyque candles, Aesop products were a cultural signifier far beyond their practical applications. I have a friend who admitted to placing a bottle in the bathroom when they were trying to sell their flat. Then came coronavirus. Whatever else might be said of the pandemic, it was boom time for handwashing, with Covid creating excellent trading conditions for Aesop, and specifically its handwashes. The NHS spent millions on videos about the correct hand-washing technique, with Boris Johnson advising we do it for the length of time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice. Aesop was perfectly positioned to take advantage of the new lather lust. With the world focused on hygiene, the brand became ubiquitous. Hand washing became a life-or-death issue, the first part of the “hands, face, space” liturgy, so paying £29 for a 500ml bottle of soap – more per millilitre than Moët & Chandon – began to seem, if not reasonable exactly, something of a treat, particularly as many of life’s pleasures had been removed. Inevitably, the brand launched a slightly pricier hand sanitiser – described by GQ as a “flex for an anxious time” – but it was sales of its established handwash that rocketed. Aesop declined to provide figures, but John Lewis listed it as one of its bestsellers of the pandemic. “I love Aesop,” says fashion and beauty writer Lisa Niven-Phillips. “You see it in certain places or homes and you think, that’s something you want to be part of.” Every brand dreams of combining small-scale allure with mass-market profits, and Aesop, which has been quietly on the march since it was founded in Melbourne in 1987, is a case in point. But how exactly does a cult product go mainstream? Even if you couldn’t identify the Resurrection Aromatique handwash, you may recognise its scent (mandarin, rosemary and cedar), which come with a potent sense association; if your hands smell like Aesop, you’re probably having a fancy time. The black and white lettering is also identifiable a mile off: the minimalist wording, the French translations, the fonts (Helvetica; Optima Medium), the macron diacritic (a straight bar) over the “e” on the label, so you know to say “Eeesop.” This attention to detail has been present since the start. The company was founded by a hairdresser, Dennis Paphitis, who started by blending essential oils into his hair products. The firm was called Emeis (Greek for “us”) before being renamed Aesop in 1989. On day one, Paphitis hired an assistant, Suzanne Santos, who proved vital to the business’s development. He started with just four products – the signature Aromatique handwash launched in 2006 – but has expanded to nearly 100. Since 2016 it has been owned by a Brazilian company, Natura & Co, and has annual revenue of more than £250m. Paphitis is now an adviser but Santos remains chief operating officer. Aesop’s internal processes are lore. Former fashion and shopping website Racked reported in 2017 that office staff had to use black Bic pens and aren’t allowed to eat lunch at their desks. Everything from toilet paper to colours on graphs on slideshows is prescribed. Aesop declined to comment. “We labour over seemingly inane decisions,” Paphitis once told the Sydney Morning Herald. “We work to make things appear effortless and as though they just happen. But actually there’s a great deal of energy involved.” For Rory Sutherland, vice-chairman of branding agency Ogilvy, Paphitis’s heritage and Aesop’s branding are important components of the company’s success. “I first encountered it in Greece and assumed it was Greek,” he says. “The packaging is very clever. It’s a category you might call “chem-lux”, in that it carries hints of both the five-star hotel and the apothecary.” At £29, the handwash is expensive enough that you can buy it as a gift without feeling stingy, while staying in the range of what a decent bottle of wine or bouquet of flowers might cost. A friend was given a bottle as a pre-baby gift to take to the maternity ward and maintains it “transformed” her birth experience. Since 2004, when its first store opened in Melbourne, Aesop has used physical premises to create an experience that feels more like a spa than a shop. The stores are vital to the brand, sleek temples in which the products are displayed like museum exhibits (film director Luca Guadagnino even helped design the minimalist Rome branch). Today there are more than 240 branches in 25 countries, plus nearly 100 department-store counters. Staff are reportedly not allowed to talk to customers about the weather: it’s too banal. Not everyone is convinced, though. “I wish bars and restaurants with good wine lists wouldn’t use their products,” says wine writer Nina Caplan. “Pick up a glass after washing your hands and you’ll be tasting Chateau Aesop whatever you ordered.” Restaurants, of course, played an important role in popularising the handwash. There are not many other places where people repeatedly wash their hands in a refined atmosphere. But for some restaurateurs, the packaging alone is enough to convey the desired effect. The refill economy (which encourages people to top up their bottles, thus saving on packaging waste) has exploded over the past few years, with companies like Fill and Ouai alongside Aesop leading the eco-charge. The owner of a high-end bistro in the south of England went one step further: “I was given it as a Christmas present and it ran out just as I was opening,” she says, “and I’m absolutely not going to spend £29 on a bottle of soap.” Instead, she refilled the bottle with a cheaper alternative, before qualifying her mischief by writing “this is not” on the bottle above the word Aesop. “My favourite bit is when people come out of the loo smelling their hands, not realising that the bottle has supermarket hand soap in it.” The brand has also inspired other businesses. The labels of Danish brand Meraki look remarkably similar. In October, discount retailer Aldi launched its own version, the Lacura Wellness Aromatic Hand Wash, in a dark amber bottle with minimalist lettering, which retails at an affordable £2.49. In one characteristically punchy interview in 2015, Paphitis said Aesop’s attention to detail was why the “philistine plagiarists who attempt to copy what we do will always fail – always”. Yet there are signs that some of the imitators might be closing in. Wary of Aesop’s ubiquity, some hospitality businesses are turning to alternatives. “We love Aesop but we reviewed our costs during the pandemic and discovered Gloved,” says James Hart of Harts, the London restaurant group that includes Barrafina, Quo Vadis and El Pastor. “We did a group test and all thought Gloved’s cedarwood smell is complementary to food – a good thing if you are going back to finish your meal. It comes in refillable glass bottles and it’s very good value.” Aesop still ships everything from its factory in Melbourne, which can be expensive and carbon-costly. It has acknowledged these concerns, and announced plans to reduce its footprint (and historically, has been ahead of the game when it comes to things like minimising packaging). But as a profitable, successful firm, it’s the obvious target for ambitious upstarts. Charlie Vickery is managing director of Haeckels, a natural skincare company focused on seasonality and locality, established 10 years ago in Margate, Kent. The company’s first product, and still its second-bestseller, is a bar soap made with seaweed picked 100 metres from its lab. A bar feels good in the hands, he says, and doesn’t involve the high carbon transportation costs. “Aesop was the pioneer of soap as a design-led product, so we owe a bit of our heritage to it,” says Vickery. “But I think it’s easy for a lot of natural skincare brands to fall and trail in their wake.” As lockdown regulations ease, Aesop bestrides the nation’s sinks like a saponaceous colossus. It even broke America, cropping up in Carrie and Big’s kitchen on the recent Sex and the City reboot. Aesop may have won the pandemic, but how long will it last?

3/25/2022,"How on earth did The Green Knight get passed over for any Oscar nominations? This visionary drama, directed by David Lowery, stars Dev Patel and Alicia Vikander and is incidentally co-produced by the achingly trendy company A24 – currently the toast of indie Hollywood. It is a freaky folk horror, or prog-rock hallucination, based on the 14th-century chivalric poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Dev Patel is Gawain, challenged by the mysterious Green Knight to a sinister game. Gawain is allowed to take a free shot at the knight’s head with his sword, on the understanding that in a year’s time the knight can do the same to him. Gawain chops the knight’s head off, and this unearthly figure simply picks up the head – which reminds Gawain to seek him out next year for the rematch – and strides off. The resulting quest is as disturbing and beautiful as anything I have seen in the cinema in the last 12 months. Why couldn’t the Academy see it? Peter Bradshaw The Academy usually goes gaga for an interracial buddy film involving a lot of driving around – see best picture winners Driving Miss Daisy (1990) and Green Book (2019). Yet, somehow, Janicza Bravo’s outrageously entertaining road movie about a part-time pole dancer (Taylour Paige) and her crassly charismatic new pal (Riley Keough) has been overlooked. The main difference between those award-winners and Zola is that Zola is actually good. It doesn’t traffic in trite racial reconciliation fantasies and the performances are uniformly excellent – Colman Domingo! Cousin Greg from Succession! Best of all, Bravo’s agile direction successfully translates a phonescreen-scale Twitter drama into a bounteous big-screen odyssey. This is an urgent task for contemporary cinema that’s barely been attempted by Hollywood’s more feted “auteurs”. Zola deserves noms in everything from best bad accent to best twerk. But it has none. Proof, yet again, that the Academy has no taste. Ellen E Jones If you had to pick a film that really summed up these crazy times, you would struggle with this year’s nominees, most of which are set in the past or 20,000 years in the future. By that measure alone, Red Rocket deserves a shout. It’s bang on the money about modern-day America without being obvious, grandstanding, preachy, weepy, joyless or dumb – which probably explains why it got no Oscar love. Its protagonist is the epitome of masculinity in crisis: a washed-up porn star whose economic and sexual impotence are inextricably linked. Simon Rex plays him with a manic (Oscar-worthy) brilliance, and as with director Sean Baker’s previous films (Tangerine, The Florida Project), Red Rocket goes places Hollywood doesn’t: this time an end-of-the-road Texas refinery town. You could call it realism – Baker uses found locations and non-actors – but the screen bursts with garish colour, and the story is as hilarious as it is grim. Steve Rose It came as no surprise that the electric Brazilian social thriller 7 Prisoners went missing from the Oscars. It’s not that the film isn’t a knockout (it is) or didn’t impress the festivals (it did). But somehow, Alexandre Moratto’s loaded account of modern slavery and moral bonfires vanished between the cracks almost as soon as it appeared on Netflix. When I mention it to friends, I get blank looks; I sometimes wonder if I’ve made the whole thing up. The movie is a Russian doll, two films in one: the first sturdy, the second extraordinary. Each begins as a tale of human trafficking, three rural teenagers working unpaid in a São Paulo scrapyard that keeps them under lock and key. You brace for hardcore realism. The story has that to burn. But then creeping ambiguities come into play, too, more awkward questions asked than simply how outraged we are. Complicity is everywhere; a spotlight falls on how films themselves manipulate who we root for and why. Put like that, the exile from the Oscars seems obvious. Their loss. Danny Leigh Rebecca Hall’s delicate, devastating directorial debut could have been nominated for Eduard Grau’s pearlescent black-and-white cinematography, which gives the film a beautiful yet clandestine perspective, all swinging hems, stirring curtains and lowered hat brims. It could have shown up in adapted screenplay, with Hall herself dextrously negotiating the minefield of Nella Larsen’s 1929 book, on which it is based. Tessa Thompson would have made a powerfully understated best actress choice and André Holland might have perked up a patchy supporting actor field. But the one that really hurts is Ruth Negga’s absence in supporting actress: hers is a riveting performance that both dazzles and shows the toll that maintaining a dazzling front can take on a brittle heart beneath. We’ve come far if in the same year we get Passing and Maggie Gyllenhaal’s superb triple nominee The Lost Daughter – two exceptional female-led debuts from actors turned writer-directors. But it shows how far we still have to go if we can’t find space to nominate both. Jessica Kiang Parasite’s win at the Oscars had the hilarious effect of invalidating so many of the Academy’s choices in one fell swoop: “You mean to say that instead of tedious American dross being nominated every year they could have been including good stuff from abroad?” Of course, it would be insane to suppose that a work of art such as Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s Memoria could compete against Belfast or the extended Twitter thread that is Don’t Look Up, but the world’s greatest living film-maker delivered something truly beautiful this year with his first film outside his native Thailand. With Tilda Swinton (a worthy best actress nominee) sublimating her star power into Weerasethakul’s story of a woman haunted by strange noises, the director somehow creates miraculous scenes of solitude and trauma seemingly out of thin air. In an age that is constantly on the go, Weerasethakul takes the time to look and hear and feel – with exquisite compositions and knotty sound design helping to create a truly immersive film experience. Caspar Salmon There are some fine movies nominated for best picture this year, but I am not sure any of them are doing anything we haven’t seen before. Jackass Forever is a true original. I know it might sound strange to make great claims of originality for the fourth feature film in a filthy, funny, scatological stunt comedy franchise. But Jackass ringleader Johnny Knoxville is 51 now. When he gets taken out by a charging bull, the result is a revealing scene about mortality. Jackass used to be about the cocky invulnerability of youth, about a bunch of guys not giving a shit if they hurt themselves, as long as they got the shot. It was like nobody believed they could really get hurt, no matter how many bumps and bruises and breaks they notched up. This time round, they know. But they’re out there anyway, bravely suffering for their art, lighting the way for the next generation of Jackasses and connecting with audiences. If that’s not the kind of movie the Oscars are meant to support, I don’t know what is.

3/25/2022,"Ican’t dance. Don’t ask me. Those who can are as, if not gods to me, then at the very least blessed, otherworldly beings. In new, chaotically entertaining reality-competition show Lizzo’s Watch Out for the Big Grrrls (Amazon Prime), they can all dance and then some. The format is much as you would expect. The star – rapper, singer, songwriter, triple Grammy-winner and flautist Lizzo – needs to recruit some new backing singers and has narrowed down her options by the time filming begins to a shortlist of 13. They will compete first for 10 places in the Big Grrrls’ Mansion, then for the four actual backing singer places before Lizzo’s next big concert, at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts festival in Tennessee. I should probably explain before we go further: they are all Big Grrrls, because that is an important part of zaftig Lizzo’s brand. The claim is that the benighted agencies were unable to supply Lizzo with anyone other than the standard size-zero dancer models, and so she’s had to take to the streets (and Amazon). Thus there is much talk of body positivity, self-love, representation, showing up for yourself, thanking God for this moment and not letting anyone steal your light/energy/trample on your beautiful soul and so on. Still, thankfully, the music and dancing generally start up again just before it becomes too emetic to be survivable without medical rehydration. The competitors range from mid-20s to mid-30s, some trained, some self-taught, some with backstories that include poverty and homelessness, all with extraordinary drive and dedication, and all in thrall to Lizzo – whose own star quality fills the screen to bursting – and the success her own talent and determination has brought. The opening episode sees the potential grrrls first dancing in front of Lizzo herself (two eight-counts of freestyle, then 40 seconds of her own choreography that they have had a week to prepare). Refreshingly – almost thrillingly, in fact, in this era of borderline despair – no one seems set up to fail. There is no weak link, no one who hasn’t got at least 90% of the goods. The mood is joyful, celebratory. Unnerving until you get used to it, but water to your parched soul thereafter. It’s hard for the untrained eye to pick out much difference between the degrees of talent here because the programme does not like to show more than three frames of anyone at a time. I sat there like the nana of nanas, huffing to myself about how Fred Astaire insisted on being shown full length and with as few cuts as possible, so the audience could enjoy what he did and what they came to see.

3/25/2022,"Why will I love it?The Sansevieria trifasciata, AKA the snake plant, has a well-deserved reputation for being nearly indestructible. It can tolerate a high level of neglect and a broad spectrum of light, making it a great starter plant. Its common name alludes to its long, dark green variegated leaves that seem to slither upwards. Light or shade?Bright light or shade. Where should I put it?This plant is one of the few that release oxygen at night, making it particularly beneficial in a bedroom, though its leaves are mildly toxic if ingested. How do I keep it alive?It thrives in bright direct light but can also tolerate moderate shade. It is also quite drought-resistant and can survive extreme temperatures, from 27C down to 5C. Like all succulents, it prefers free-draining compost that dries out between waterings. Water weekly in summer and reduce frequency in winter. It can go weeks without watering and still survive – it will look very dehydrated, but will bounce back with a good watering. Did you know?A Nasa clean air study suggested that snake plants can purify the air by removing certain toxins, such as formaldehyde, xylene and toluene.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Houseplant of the week: snake plant,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/25/houseplant-of-the-week-snake-plant
3/25/2022,"When you are feeling under the weather, eating good, nutritious food can make all the difference. Simple, comforting dishes, such as soup, are a firm favourite among the convalescing, as are nourishing casseroles, while some people swear by meals with a spicy kick when they are feeling blocked up. Fluids are important, as are foods that will give you energy and provide essential vitamins and minerals. Sadly, there is no miracle dish to provide a quick fix when you are sick. But, with Covid cases on the rise once again in the UK, and seasonal lurgies still doing the rounds too, we asked chefs about the meals they turn to when they are unwell. Tamal Ray, doctor, TV presenter and 2015 Great British Bake Off finalist When I’m ill, I eat simple stuff: my mum used to make me mashed potatoes with basmati rice. I also have a chicken dish I make after I’ve been ill, to get back on track. I roast a chicken in a big tray, along with onions and garlic in a separate tray. Once the chicken is cooked, I take it out and pour some boiling water into the tray to make a stock to cook the lentils in. Then I steam kale, stir it into the cooked lentils along with the onions and garlic, and serve with the chicken on the side and a spoonful of Greek yoghurt. Nokx Majozi, chief pie-maker at the Holborn Dining Room, London When I’m not feeling well, I like to make a comforting fish curry with maize. There are some great health benefits: the fish is high in protein, the maize (you can also use polenta) provides fibre, and ginger and garlic are known for their antioxidants. This meal also has a lot of sentimental value – it reminds me of being in the kitchen as a child with my late father, who used to make it for us. I’m from Durban in South Africa, and he worked in the harbour, next to the fishmonger. He often used to come home with fresh fish for dinner, so it’s a fond memory. Stuart Gillies, chef and co-owner of Number Eight, Sevenoaks When I’m unwell, I usually go for broth and ramen – you get so much goodness in there. I use dashi stock and bonito flakes as the base – then you can add whatever you want: herbs (freshly picked and coarsely chopped), soft boiled eggs, salmon or cod, chicken or beef, soya beans, peas, broccoli – anything goes. Then we cook and add udon noodles, and top with togarashi (seven-spice mix) or chilli oil. You feel as if you’re getting healthier as you eat it! It’s really delicious. We’re a family of six, so I make it for all of us when we’re under the weather. Judy Joo, chef patron and co-founder of Seoul Bird, London I’m a big fan of hearty soups and stews when I’m not feeling well, and I have perfected my ginseng chicken soup recipe. You simply stuff a whole, corn-fed poussin with dried ginseng, sweet rice, jujube fruit, garlic and other oriental herbs, then boil in a large pan with water for two to three hours until the meat is soft. Serve with freshly chopped spring onions. It warms you from within and hugs your soul. I also make a lot of bone broth and slurp my way back to health! To drink, I’ll usually go for a cup of hot water with fresh lemon, ginger slices and manuka honey. Lisa Goodwin-Allen, executive head chef at The Gamebird at the Stafford, London When I’m sick, I want something hearty. I often turn to homemade soups and broths, but my guilty pleasure is tinned tomatoes on toast with grated cheese. You want tiger bread or sourdough, nicely toasted and buttered. Heat the tinned tomatoes until piping hot, then place them on the toast and top with grated cheese – I’d recommend a lancashire cheese – and a little bit of salt. It’s quick, easy and not too heavy. If you’re not feeling 100% you can leave out the cheese and butter and it will still get you eating something. I’d have it with a cup of green tea. Nikhil Mahale, head chef at Farzi Café, London I don’t remember the last time I was ill – but, when I am, I really like to eat an Indian soup made from lambs’ trotters, called paya. You boil the trotters for six to eight hours, then add onion, turmeric, roasted cumin, a lot of fresh black pepper, and you can also add red chilli powder and tomatoes. It’s a yellow-ish soup, flavoured by the bone marrow from the trotters. It is spicy, but it’s really good and it takes all the cold from your body. We serve it with pav bread, baked in a wood-fired oven. I also like to eat chicken ghee roast with wholewheat rotis and chapatis. Luke French, chef-owner of Jöro, Sheffield Whenever I’m poorly, I make a hot and sour Thai tom yum soup. I start by making a really spicy and aromatic Thai red curry paste, which I cook down in coconut oil, then add chicken stock and a touch of coconut milk. Then I add fresh lime juice and rice wine vinegar to make it sour, and a little palm and caster sugar. To that, I’ll add shredded chicken or prawns and loads of fresh vegetables: broccoli, pak choi, mangetout, broccoli, sweetcorn – anything. I add the veg for 30-40 seconds at the end, so it’s nice and crunchy and full of nutrients. At this time of year, I also add handfuls of wild garlic. Shaun Rankin, chef patron at Grantley Hall, Ripon When I’m ill, a quick and easy meal is baked beans on toast with pesto and parmesan. Cook the beans (I use Heinz), then add a dollop of pesto, grated parmesan and butter, give it a good mix, then place on nice, crunchy, sourdough toast. It’s feel-good food. I’m a tea drinker, but if I’m ill, it’s Lemsip and Berocca. I had Covid in January last year, and lost my sense of taste and smell, so I was fuelling my body with hot porridge and batches of homemade leek and potato soup. I had to add lots of seasoning and garlic to get any flavour out of it. Tanya Gohil, chef-owner of Silk Road Deli, Glasgow My go-to dish is kadhi, which is essentially spiced, sour yoghurt soup. My family is from Gujarat, where we have it with sautéed okra. You start off by heating whole spices: mustard seeds, cumin seeds, curry leaves, a cinnamon stick and whole black peppercorns. You also add freshly grated ginger and turmeric for that wholesome-goodness vibe. Separately, mix natural yoghurt with chickpea flour, then add to the spices along with a couple of cups of water. It becomes thick and velvety, with lots of warmth and depth. Add in the sautéed okra 10 minutes before serving and top with fresh coriander, a drizzle of chilli oil and a spritz of lemon. Daniel Watkins, co-founder of Acme Fire Cult, London Away from work, the food I cook is quite plant-based and if I’m unwell, I want lots of greens: broccoli, curly kale and spinach are my go-tos. Don’t blanch them – just cook with a little oil and a splash or water in a hot, lidded pan to retain all the goodness. I top with nuts and seeds, and a TMT (tahini, miso, turmeric) dressing which really packs a punch. When you’re ill, you have to drink loads of water to flush your system out – but I’m a coffee fiend, so I would still have coffee.

3/25/2022,"The impact the Covid-19 pandemic has had on the jobs market in the UK has been enormous. By January 2021, unemployment had risen to 5% – the highest it had been since 2016. That figure has since improved, with unemployment back down to 3.9%. Indeed, there are now many businesses struggling with staffing issues, just as there are jobseekers trying to find the right employer. In response to this, the government has launched the Way to Work campaign, a partnership between employers and Jobcentre Plus, designed to help 500,000 jobseekers on universal credit or jobseeker’s allowance into work by the end of June 2022. Figures from the Office for National Statistics in January show the demand for workers is there, with a record 1.3m vacancies to fill (59% higher than pre-pandemic levels). This number of vacancies shows why engagement between the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and employers is more important than ever. “We work with every sector to provide staff, especially but not only in retail, hospitality, construction and logistics, and we see what we do as a partnership with the employer,” says David, an employer adviser for the DWP’s Dudley borough employer adviser team. “We want to work with everybody. Anyone looking for staff. The Way to Work campaign is about trying to increase the profile of the Jobcentre Plus network so that the employers then use us as their first port of call.” Abdhesh Kumar is an electrical engineer by trade and founder of Edinburgh-based energy tech startup, Copper & Carbon. Through Jobcentre Plus, he was given access to multiple candidates during a critical time for his business. “Copper & Carbon was officially set up in July 2020 – it began as a PhD project proposal – with a goal of reducing CO2 emissions by developing products and services,” says Kumar. “We’re currently working on converting our initial wind turbine concept into a tangible product.” The startup is part of the Edinburgh Business School Incubator – which includes office space, mentoring and support. But, as Kumar explains, until he engaged with Jobcentre Plus through the Kickstart scheme – which ended in December 2021, but at the time offered funding for six-month job placements – Copper & Carbon had been a one-man operation. “It was actually me just trying to develop the idea alone,” he says. But with the help of Jobcentre Plus, the startup’s first employees joined in June 2021. The hiring process was surprisingly smooth, says Kumar. “We were sent an application form to complete, which asked for as much detail as we could offer in terms of what our company does and how the scheme could possibly help us.” In Kumar’s case, he says it was only through the assistance provided by the government and Jobcentre Plus that he was able to hire anyone to join the business at all. “I’m still at the ideas stage, so receiving funding for recruitment would be a few years down the line,” he adds. Matthew, a mechanical engineering graduate, was employed by Kumar in August 2021 after being on universal credit for two weeks. While his placement was scheduled to end in January he’s been able to remain with Copper & Carbon beyond this initial contract. “I graduated at the height of the pandemic and most companies weren’t taking on employees – some were even getting rid of people,” says Matthew. This meant that finding a job wasn’t easy, he says, but then he was given assistance through Jobcentre Plus once he was on universal credit. “Jobcentre Plus recommended various companies to apply for jobs with, based on my CV and degree. The whole thing was pretty straightforward – I was sent job descriptions and applications by my work coach, which I’d read through and if I was happy, I could apply,” he says. Any initial concerns, he adds, were immediately allayed after seeing the wide range of suitable roles available. “As soon as I told them I had a degree and experience in this specific area [mechanical engineering], they matched suitable jobs to my expertise, which was a pleasant surprise.” As well as finding paid employment during a precarious time, the wider opportunities the role has provided have surpassed his expectations. It’s largely due to working at a startup, he says: “It’s been really great and actually very different to how I pictured my first job to be, purely because we’re a small company. “The best thing is definitely that myself and the other engineer here have a lot of responsibility and influence over what we’re doing day-to-day. We have a lot of freedom in that sense, which I really appreciate because in a bigger company, it would take years to get to that point. We also have input into other things that aren’t purely mechanical, too. For example, I’ve learned business skills and electronic engineering skills – we’re all collaborating on everything.” Kumar remains grateful for the support he received from Jobcentre Plus, which has enabled the business to grow, and he hopes similar initiatives will be available in the future. “Without it, I think the progress we’ve made would have taken an additional year and a half,” he says. “It was really beneficial.” And, as Kumar points out, it works equally well for all parties involved. “Everyone benefits at the same time – candidates are better equipped with the knowledge and skills to find other roles going forward. It’s a great opportunity to prepare each candidate with experience, learning and training, so by the time the pandemic is over, they will have something to showcase,” he says. Matthew adds: “My advice is to make sure your skills and experience are clearly known to your work coach, because that way, you’re going to be matched with jobs that really fit your skill set. I can only speak from my own experience, but when I joined there were quite a lot of engineering jobs that fitted my experience, all across the UK. I’d say go for it.” To find out how job-ready candidates can quickly fill your recruitment needs, or for advice to help you find your next job, visit gov.uk/waytowork.

3/25/2022,"In Mutzenbacher, Viennese film-maker Ruth Beckermann’s latest hybrid documentary, a young man sitting on a tufted pink sofa set against a bare concrete wall explains why he threw caution to the wind to talk on camera about his sex life. “Because I trust you as a director,” he says with an apologetic smile. “So if I told you take off your clothes and have sex with whomever, a tree, you would do it, because you trust me?” Beckermann prods. “Well,” the young man replies. “At least I’d think about it.” Much of the appeal of Beckermann’s quietly extraordinary documentaries and essay films, already revered in German-speaking Europe and now available with English subtitles in their entirety for the first time via streaming platform True Story, relies on her talent for extracting confessions that she hasn’t had to ask for. “I think I’ve always had a certain talent for communication, or at least a lack of fear of human contact,” Beckermann says via video link from her book-lined study in Vienna. “When I meet a person and the camera is running, I can focus on that person to an incredible degree.” For Return to Vienna, her 1983 portrait of the Jewish Austrian socialist Franz West, she prepared for the interview with a stack of index cards with questions. “Now I no longer write down questions at all,” says the director. “I am prepared, but in a broader sense. And directly before the interview, I try to think of nothing at all.” Born in Vienna in 1952, Beckermann made her first documentary aged 25. Arena Squatted, about the occupation of a former abattoir turned arts centre in the Austrian capital, was the first of three short films she made about direct action and workers’ rights. In hindsight, she refers to that trilogy as flugblattfilme, “pamphlet films”. “We wanted to change the world, and we believed that our films could play a part in that,” she says. “We wanted to influence people. Nowadays I am more interested in getting people to start debating or talking.” Born to Jewish parents who were raised in the eastern provinces of the Austro-Hungarian empire and who, in her mother’s case, only reluctantly moved to Austria after the end of the second world war, Beckmann has retained an outsider’s view on the republic where most of her films are set. Jewish Austrians who, like her parents, decided to continue living in a nation that murdered their relatives are not just the subjects of Return to Vienna. They are also the focus of 1987’s Paper Bridge, an elegiac essay about the Bukovina region in what is now Romania and Ukraine; 2001’s Homemad(e), a series of interviews with the shop-owners and coffeehouse regulars on her street in Vienna; and 2016’s The Dreamed Ones, about the love affair between poets Paul Celan and Ingeborg Bachmann – he a Holocaust survivor, she the daughter of a Nazi party member. The Waldheim Waltz (2018), Beckermann’s most stylistically conventional and internationally successful film, examines the 1986 election campaign of the former Austrian president, Kurt Waldheim, and the ease with which his conservative Austrian People’s party slipped back into antisemitic campaigning after the World Jewish Congress had identified unexplained gaps in the politician’s wartime record. The young film-maker was one of the people who took to the street against Waldheim’s nomination at the time. As personal as Beckermann’s subjects often are, the films that most bear her stamp are those in which her authorial presence is least discernible. The most remarkable remains East of War from 1996. Filmed over five weeks at an exhibition that showed for the first time photographs documenting war crimes committed by the Wehrmacht – many of them in the same Ukrainian cities currently devastated by another war – it consists only of conversations with ageing visitors who had themselves fought in the German army. “Barely any of these men asked me who I was or whom I was making my film for,” Beckermann recalls. “That was fascinating. I think they needed someone to talk to in that moment. I barely had to ask any questions.” Most of the former fighters are in active or passive denial: if they acknowledge that such atrocities took place, they insist they must have been committed by another division but not their own, in cities far from where they were stationed, at another point in the war. When they are challenged about their recollections, it is by other veterans who break into the frame to interrupt the interview. “The difficult decisions for East of War wasn’t in the interviews but whether to show the photographs on display. I chose to keep them in the background. If I had shown them, I would have created a contrast between memory and history. I wanted to show the contradictions within people’s memories.” In Mutzenbacher, which won one of the top prizes at this year’s Berlin film festival, Beckermann followed a similar approach. The 70-year-old placed an ad in the Austrian press inviting auditions from “men between the ages of 16 and 99, no screen experience necessary”. More than 150 responded, half of whom ended up sitting on her sofa in pairs, where they were asked to read extracts from the novel Josefine Mutzenbacher, or The Story of a Viennese Whore. Published anonymously in 1906 and written (according to an increasingly disputed rumour spread by the satirist Karl Kraus) by Bambi creator Felix Salten, Josefine Mutzenbacher is less of an erotic novel than a straightforward pornographic one, and an uneasy contemporary read at that: its fictional underage heroine romps through explicit encounters with prepubescent boys and a host of older men including her priest, her teacher and, eventually, her own father. Beckermann doesn’t throw the charge sheet at her interviewees, but allows them to endorse or distance themselves of their own accord from the century-old male fantasy of female lust. One man volunteers erotic fantasies of threesomes he appears not to yet have discussed with his spouse. Another does not hide his titillation at a description of incest. When toxic masculinity is interrogated, it is done by the other men on the sofa, not the film-maker. “It’s not in my interest to lead people on or get them to say things they don’t want to say,” Beckermann says. “And I think people notice that. I am generally not that interested in what people say rather than how they say it, how they look while they say it, whether they lie or say the truth. It’s about more than statements.” In keeping with its pornographic source material, Mutzenbacher ends on a climax. One elderly man starts his interview by stating he is unwilling to read a passage whose language he perceives as too crude, only to then perform an even more explicit extract, leaning into the breathless yelps of orgasmic delight. “I thought he was about to leave, but then he stayed,” Beckermann says. “But of course making films has to do with seduction. You have to enjoy seducing people to join you on a different level.”  The Waldheim Waltz and the Ruth Beckermann retrospective start on 25 March on True Story.",Arts/Film,"Sex, strikes and Nazis: the revered director making Austria spill its secrets",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/25/sex-strikes-and-nazis-the-revered-director-making-austria-spill-its-secrets
