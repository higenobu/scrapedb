1/4/2022,"Two of New Zealand’s most prominent Covid experts are taking legal action against their employer, the University of Auckland, over what they say is its failure to respond adequately to “harassment from a small but venomous sector of the public” that is becoming “more extreme”. Siouxsie Wiles, an associate professor of medical science, and Shaun Hendy, a professor of physics, have filed separate complaints to the Employment Relations Authority, which last week ruled that they should proceed directly to the Employment Court due to the “high public interest” in their Covid commentary.  According to the ruling, the scientists say that as a result of their work they have “suffered vitriolic, unpleasant, and deeply personalised threats and harassment” via email, social media and video sharing platforms which has had a “detrimental impact” on their physical safety as well as their mental health. The determination also noted that Wiles had also been the victim of doxxing – in which personal information is published about a person online – while Hendy has been physically confronted at his university office by a person who threatened to “see him soon”. The pair say that they are expected to provide public commentary as part of their jobs and that it is “consistent with the principle of academic freedom” but that the university had “failed to take proactive action to protect them” from abuse and that it had “failed to take all reasonable steps to provide a safe working environment”. Wiles, who is known for her trademark pink hair, was named New Zealander of the Year last year for her work on explaining the science behind the Covid-19 pandemic, including everything from how the virus spreads to how vaccines work. Her collaborations with cartoonist Toby Morris for The Spinoff website were widely shared and resulted in work for the World Health Organization. Hendy’s expertise in data-modelling has been credited with shaping the country’s pandemic response. The Employment Relations Authority determination said the issue of their safety had first been raised in early 2020 shortly after the pandemic began but the steps taken to protect them were “inadequate” and not consistent with the university’s contractual and statutory obligations and had resulted in “ongoing unjustified disadvantage”. The scientists, who say they had been asked by both the university and the prime minister’s office to provide Covid commentary, claim that in a letter sent in August, the university urged them to cut back on their public comments and suggested they take paid leave in order to“minimise any social media comment”. The university denies unjustifiably disadvantaging the scientists or breaching its statutory obligations and said they were neither expected or required to provide comment on Covid as part of their jobs, adding that much of their public commentary had been undertaken in a private capacity. It also said that it had responded “appropriately” to Wiles’ and Hendy’s concerns and denied telling them to keep their public comments to a minimum. It said it had “merely advised the applicants that doing so is an option they may want to consider”. The Employment Relations Authority said the matter should be resolved as quickly as possible by the court – rather than going through the authority’s sometimes lengthy and potentially more costly process – due to the high public interest in their commentary. It also noted, “the authority is concerned about the uncontested evidence that the harassment is escalating and is expected to continue to do so. The issues associated with the vaccination of children aged 5-11 years of age is already a topic that has stirred up increased vitriol towards the applicants.”",News/World news,New Zealand Covid experts sue employer over alleged failure to protect them from abuse,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/new-zealand-covid-experts-sue-employer-over-alleged-failure-to-protect-them-from-abuse
1/4/2022,"One evening a week, Natasha Msweswe and Zanele Madasi leave their children at home and set out to patrol the streets of Thembokwezi. They return at midnight. This is potentially very dangerous but they feel they have little choice. “It can be scary but we want to protect our community,” said Madasi, 31. “We want to make a difference.”  Thembokwezi is a neighbourhood of Khayelitsha, a sprawling, overcrowded township overlooked by Table Mountain that has long been infamous for high levels of gang violence, drug abuse and unemployment. South African police are stretched very thin and so a network of neighbourhood watch organisations play a key role in fighting crime here. Thembokwezi is more prosperous and safer than much of the rest of the township, and those who live here want to keep it that way. “We work with the police of course … but if we fold our arms as a community, the criminals will run amok,” said Phindile George, the leader of the Thembokwezi neighbourhood watch, which counts 50 volunteers including Msweswe and Madasi among its members. Across South Africa, tens of thousands of people are making similar resolutions. Some teach, secure reliable electricity supplies, organise vaccination drives, repair roads, deliver protective gear to hospitals or distribute water. Many work almost alone, others in NGOs or for wealthy businesses that are now setting aside large sums for philanthropic work. What all share is an almost total lack of faith in South Africa’s government to provide any kind of a solution for their problems. “People have given up on the state as a protector … There is a massive loss of faith. It’s a tragedy,” said William Gumede, a respected analyst and academic in Johannesburg. The retreat of the state from everyday life in the continent’s most developed country has widespread consequences, changing the way people think, behave and interact, especially in a time of crisis. The death of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who was almost universally revered, provided a moment of paradoxical hope as well as grief: reminding many South Africans of what they have in common after many months where circumstances have conspired to drive them apart. Most South Africans were suffering even before Covid struck, and discontent with the ruling African National Congress (ANC), in power since the end of the racist, repressive apartheid regime in 1994, has been growing for years. Economic growth was already slowing even before the nine-year rule of Jacob Zuma, the populist president ousted in 2018 amid widespread corruption allegations. Despite the good intentions of the current president, Cyril Ramaphosa, a former labour activist turned tycoon, there has been little to celebrate since. The pandemic has delivered a series of crushing blows to the economy. Rolling power cuts shut down businesses and factories for weeks on end, while the public healthcare system has been lethally undermined by mismanagement and corruption. The government claims 90,000 South Africans have died from Covid, but reliable excess mortality figures suggest the real death toll is between two and three times higher. Depending on the definition, unemployment could be as high as 46.6%. In July, in the worst breakdown in public order for decades, hundreds of shopping malls were looted, warehouses torched and key infrastructure targeted across a swath of South Africa. Much of the violence appears to have been instigated by renegade factions within the ruling party, angered by the jailing of Zuma on contempt of court charges. This shook faith in the state too, and a few people turned to vigilante violence. The neighbourhood watch in Thembokwezi aims to reinforce official efforts, but in a rougher part of Khayelitsha a community has come together to confront local authorities. When a strict lockdown at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 led to widespread illegal evictions, hundreds of homeless people occupied a patch of wasteland and built homes of tin and wood. “For years the politicians said they would use this land for homes for us. They failed to fulfil their promises … So we decided to take it over and do it ourselves,” said Mabhelandile Twani, 40, a community leader. Despite efforts to evict them anew, this neighbourhood has thrived. Now more than 15,000 people live in rows of shacks on the sandy soil. Electricity is diverted from better-supplied streets nearby. Twani calls it “people’s power”. The neighbourhood is known as Lockdown Village. There are many other such settlements born of the misery inflicted by Covid in a country unable to afford the expensive support offered to individuals and businesses in Europe, the UK or the US. In Khayelitsha, there are now settlements called Sanitiser, Quarantine and Social Distance. “Now things are so difficult. We don’t get help from the government. We try to help ourselves,” said Nondwebi Kasba, 73, who helps to run a communal vegetable garden set up by neighbours in Khayelithsa’s Illitha Park to help the poorest among them. Seven hundred miles to the east, in Graaff-Reinet, a small and conservative town in the Karoo desert, there is also a new struggle for the basics that the state once provided. In the townships on Graaff-Reinet’s outskirts, drug dealers steal water tanks from schools and hawk their contents alongside cannabis and methamphetamines. No one bothers to tell the police, expecting that they will not come. Jobs are rare. So too are the means by which young people could gain the skills to allow them to escape. Khanya Mbaile, a 31-year-old office administrator, hopes to start a coffee shop and internet cafe that would provide a safe meeting place for young people in the township where she lives. She has already sourced six computers from an NGO. “We are all exhausted but there is a glimmer of hope,” Mbaile said. Louise Masimela, 58, who runs a community school for young children in a township just south of Graaff-Reinet, is another of South Africa’s perpetual problem-solvers. The former journalist has no permanent premises for her students, scarce water and no funds to pay teachers. “It’s tough, really tough … but we want to give our kids an education that will allow them to go out into the world, not get stuck here,” said Masimela. So she has found solutions: a church offers a space during the week, and seven volunteers teach. Water comes from The Gift of the Givers, now one of South Africa’s biggest NGOs. Funded entirely by private donors, mainly businesses, it distributes 400m rand (£20m) of aid annually. In Eastern Cape province, the NGO works in hospitals, providing much-needed PPE, medicine, oxygen delivery devices, food for patients and even goody bags to motivate healthworkers. Elsewhere in the province, one of South Africa’s poorest, it has provided seeds, fodder and food for orphanages, trucked water into poor communities and even dug boreholes. “There are a lot of good people in government who want to do the right thing … and I can see things changing. It’s not massive change but people want to fix things,” said Dr Imtiaz Sooliman, the NGO’s founder. “We have to fill the gap but by filling the gap we are putting on pressure. People are asking why we are doing what the government should do.” Recent local elections have been seen by many analysts as a cause for optimism. The ANC was punished by voters, losing 8.3% of its vote share and just under 1,000 council seats. The party was forced to share power in many small towns – including Graaff-Reinet – and its grasp on cities such as Johannesburg and Pretoria slipped further. In several towns, local communities joined together to create political alternatives that frequently won support. “A lot of this is hopeful … It shows a desire for a new inclusive project,” said Gumede. Many see a need for political options that offer an authentic alternative to the ANC but also escape the toxic legacy of South Africa’s traumatic past. The dominance of the ANC at national level means the most important political battles occur within the organisation. Judith February, an analyst, wrote for the Daily Maverick website in December: “From the insurrection in July to the shambles which is our intelligence services, [from] an increasing … anti-vaxx position to a commitment to coal, the tensions within the party are … at odds with the country’s best interests. Ramaphosa’s grip on power appears reluctant and tenuous.” Farmers say the relief provided by rain that has broken a five-year drought has helped the agricultural sector offset losses elsewhere, but the key industry of tourism has been badly hit by the pandemic, with huge losses of income and jobs. “It has been a disaster, a total disaster,” said 59-year-old Kobus Potgeiter, who runs a farm guesthouse outside the town of Oudsthoorn, on the spectacular R62 road that was once busy with tourists. After 16 years he is thinking of closing for good, or at least downscaling. In Franschhoek, a centre of fine dining and wine-making amid mountains and vineyards an hour’s drive from Cape Town, the absence of overseas visitors has forced top restaurants to close, hotels to shut for months, and led to the loss of thousands of jobs. As elsewhere, the national vaccination campaign has lacked resources, offering minimal opportunities for local people to get jabbed and almost no information that might help overcome very widespread hesitancy. To convince would-be visitors that the town was safe, Franschhoek’s tourist office sought to organise its own vaccination drive, supported by crowdfunding, big businesses and the local administration. By November, 85% of those working in the hospitality industry were jabbed. But just as the tourists began returning, the identification of the Omicron variant in South Africa brought new travel bans. “It was devastating,” said Ruth McCourt, a marketing manager. In a country with some of the highest levels of inequality in the world, some have been able to weather South Africa’s economic and political storm better than others. Even its residents admit Franshhoek is a “bit of a bubble”. Khayelitsha is not, and its half a million inhabitants have little protection from the forces buffeting the country. “It will be a bitter, black Christmas,” said Twani, the community leader in Lockdown Village, interviewed in mid-December. “My fear is that here in South Africa we are living in a timebomb. People are angry … Eventually, anything can happen.”",News/World news,A crisis of faith in South Africa: ‘People have given up on the state’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/a-crisis-of-faith-in-south-africa-people-have-given-up-on-the-state
