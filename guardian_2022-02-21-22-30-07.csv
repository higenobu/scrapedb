2/21/2022,"Mo Gilligan performed no fewer than 10 nights at the 3,000-seat Hammersmith Apollo last autumn, a run now captured for posterity by this second Netflix special. In the UK, Gilligan’s star just keeps rising. Whether the rest of the world will fall for his tales of Magnum ice-creams, Shepherd’s Bush shopping centres and geezers down the pub remains to be seen. You wouldn’t bet against it. Beyond its local colour, Gilligan’s anthropological comedy – on being skint, being in relationships, and being out on the town – can probably be enjoyed by anyone. Then there’s the 34-year-old’s performing talent, which I enjoyed in close-up here having peered at it from Row ZZZ last October. There’s no point pretending the Camberwell man is blazing new trails in comedy. From the opening, fish-out-of-water tale of newfound celebrity to his material on childhood, the pre-fame hustle and social rituals across the gender divide, he’s swimming in the same sea as countless comics before him. But Gilligan is terrifically adept at bringing the material to life. There’s the act-out that finds his mother menacing boyhood Mo (head shaking, lower lip loose, whimpering “I don’t know where’s the change”) when a shopping errand goes wrong. Or the tense dialogue between young Mo, working the shopfloor at Jo Malone, and an unwelcome customer.  That routine turns on the “code-switching” Gilligan must do to hold down a job in retail. What’s remarkable about his standup is how little code-switching is required to keep his several audiences onside. Some of the material is explicitly black British, one routine anatomises white Brits on the booze, and the closing section – on group social behaviour across the sexes – aims, with its broad but recognisable generalisations, to apply to everyone. And all the while, Gilligan is only ever his cheerful, warm-hearted self, as amused by the memory of life without a penny to his name as by his recent adventures in showbiz. Not everything takes wing: the call-and-response section was so-so in the room and is weaker still onscreen. But this remains a confident and likable hour by an act whose common touch seems proof, for now at least, against superstardom.

2/21/2022,"Not quite a quiche, nor a crostata, this is a neat way to produce a golden-crusted, cheese-laden pie with very little effort. As with most pies, this is as comforting as it is delicious, and a thrifty way to use up all those bits of cheese that lurk in the fridge. Buy in good-quality, all-butter puff pastry and no one will believe that it isn’t homemade.  Prep 15 minCook 1 hr 10 minServes 4 300g new potatoes50g butter100g pancetta slices, roughly chopped4 leeks, washed and sliced6-8 thyme sprigs6 tbsp creme fraiche1 tbsp wholegrain mustardSalt and black pepper320g puff pastry125g cheddar (or any other mature hard cheese), grated40g parmesan, grated1 egg, to glaze Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Put the potatoes in a pan of salted water, bring to a boil and cook for 15-18 minutes, until tender. Drain and, when cool enough to handle, peel and slice into 5mm-thick rounds. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium pan over a medium heat, add the pancetta and fry for four to five minutes, until it begins to release its fat. Add the leeks and thyme, cover and cook for a further 10 minutes, until very soft. Remove the lid, cook for another few minutes to drive off the moisture, then stir in the creme fraiche and mustard. Season well, take off the heat and leave to cool. Roll out the pastry so that it is roughly 3mm thick, making sure it is just larger than your pastry dish, which should be 24-26cm diameter. Put half the sliced potatoes on the base of the dish, then spoon over half the leek mix and sprinkle over half of both cheeses, then repeat. Brush a little egg around the rim of the pie dish, then top it with the pastry. Trim and crimp the edges, make a small air hole in the middle, then brush more egg over the top. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until crisp and golden. Serve with a crisp green salad. There are some great vegan puff pastries in the shops – use one here, exclude the dairy and swap in some wintry roots and Indian spice pastes for a delicious vegan curry puff pie.

2/21/2022,"The elections watchdog has urged the government not to give ministers a greater say in its work, saying plans to do so would seriously undermine its independence and could affect confidence in the wider electoral system. In a strongly worded and highly unusual public letter, the Electoral Commission said provisions in the elections bill for ministers to draw up a new “strategy and policy statement” – which the watchdog must take account of – had no precedent in comparable democracies.  “It is our firm and shared view that the introduction of a strategy and policy statement – enabling the government to guide the work of the commission – is inconsistent with the role that an independent electoral commission plays in a healthy democracy,” the letter said. “This independence is fundamental to maintaining confidence and legitimacy in our electoral system.” The letter was signed by the full board of the commission, representing all four UK nations, with the exception of Conservative peer Stephen Gilbert, the party’s representative on the board,. The House of Lords is now considering the bill. Ministers have insisted the provisions will not amount to interference. However, critics and opposition parties have labelled the idea an attempt to neuter the organisation and stop it looking too closely at areas such as party funding. In the letter, the commissioners said the plan would compel the watchdog “to have regard to the government’s strategic and policy priorities and to help the government to meet those priorities. “It would thereby provide a mechanism, driven by the then governing party, enabling that party’s ministers to shape how electoral law is applied to them and their political competitors. “While the stated position of the current government is that it would not intend to use these powers to impact on the commission’s independent oversight and regulation of the electoral system, no such assurances can be given about how the broad scope of these powers would be used over time. “The statement has no precedent in the accountability arrangements of electoral commissions in other comparable democracies, such as Canada, Australia or New Zealand.” The idea of the strategy and policy statement was drawn up by the Cabinet Office under Michael Gove. Responsibility for the elections bill has moved with Gove to the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. Writing to Gove and other ministers in the new department, the commissioners urged them “to think again about these measures”, and instead work with the existing Speaker’s Committee on the Electoral Commission, a cross-party group. “Strong accountability is essential for this, but so too is demonstrable independence,” they wrote. “The commission’s independent role in the electoral system must be clear for voters and campaigners to see, and preserved in electoral law.” The elections bill contains a number of other controversial elements, not least plans to oblige anyone who votes in person at a general election across the UK, or in local elections in England, to show photo ID first. While ministers argue this is necessary to prevent voter impersonation, critics say the plan is an illiberal and expensive overreaction to an almost nonexistent problem and could put off many thousands of people from voting, with some likening it to US Republican-style voter suppression tactics.
