12/27/2021,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: “I represent more, or just as many or more, people than Joe Manchin does.” PolitiFact's ruling: False Here's why: After Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said he could not support President Joe Biden’s safety net bill, the Build Back Better Act, a leading House progressive, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, appeared on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" and took aim at the senator. ""The idea that Joe Manchin says that he can’t explain this back home to his people is a farce,"" Ocasio-Cortez said on Dec. 20. ""I mean, it’s a farce in terms of plain democracy, because I represent more or just as many or more people than Joe Manchin does — perhaps more,"" she said. On the numerical comparison, Ocasio-Cortez is wrong. (Her office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Fact-check: Was Jan. 6 'used as a pretext' to take away Americans' constitutional rights? Ocasio-Cortez represents the 14th congressional district of New York, which includes parts of two boroughs in New York City. The district’s population was 696,664 in the most recent Census estimate available, from 2019. By contrast, Manchin, who as a senator represents the whole state of West Virginia, has 1,793,716 constituents, according to the 2020 Census. That means that Manchin represents roughly 2.6 times as many people as Ocasio-Cortez does. Fact-check: Are migrants being tested for COVID-19 at southern border? Senators run in statewide elections and count the entire state’s population as their constituency. But for those who would argue that each of a state’s two senators should count for only half the population, Ocasio-Cortez’ statement still falls short. Half of West Virginia’s population is close to 900,000, which is nearly 30% more than Ocasio-Cortez’s district has. We rate the statement False.

12/27/2021,"A crew demolishing a 20th-century home in Utah discovered something strange inside it: Another house. Turns out the rather plain home had been wrapped around an equally plain log cabin that dates to the 1880s, experts say. That’s before Utah became a state (in 1896). Realizing the historic significance, the crew halted work and the city has stepped up to save the home, which sits wedged between commercial buildings. “The 1880s cabin is prepped and ready to be moved,” Orem officials announced Dec. 23. “The move will take place next week (Dec 27-31). Our intent is to ultimately place this cabin at our new Heritage Park ... to help tell the story of those that settled this community.” Heritage Park is about 3 miles south of the home’s current location. The park is still two years from being completed. However, city officials jumped at the chance to get the cabin when its owners, the Shimada family, offered to donate it. The discovery was made the first week of November by contractor Bill Fairbanks, who posted photos of the find on a community Facebook page called “You know you’re from Orem UT if....” “We’d heard that supposedly there was a cabin in the house,” Fairbanks told the Daily Herald. “We started pulling the house apart and chipped away at the walls. We peeled layer by layer.” Fairbanks described the discovery as an “almost whole, 1881 pioneer cabin ... still sitting on its rock foundation!” The cabin is believed to have been built by a pioneer couple known as the Hansons, he said. Years later, the Shimada family bought the land and ran a fruit stand on it, reported TV station KUTV. Orem Town Manager Steven Downs says the home, which about 550-square-feet, dates to a time when the area “was a lot of orchards and multiple cabins,” KSL-TV reported. “This is the home of the Hansons, but this represents the home of so many who homesteaded this property and began the legacy of hard work and entrepreneurship,” Downs told the station. Photos shared by Orem officials show the roof had been removed as part of the demolition work, so crews rushed to add tarps “to preserve the inside of the cabin.” City officials did not give specifics for when work will begin on the home’s restoration.

12/27/2021,"By Manoj Kumar NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government on Monday froze the bank accounts of Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity (MoC) in West Bengal, the state's political leader said on Monday, after weekend protests over Christmas celebrations. Hindu vigilante groups disrupted Christmas mass in parts of India, including in Modi's core territory ahead of local elections in the coming months. Hardline Hindu outfits affiliated to Modi's party have repeatedly accused the MoC of leading religious conversion programmes under the guise of charity by offering poor Hindus and tribal communities money, free education and shelter. ""Shocked to hear that (at) Christmas, Union Ministry FROZE ALL BANK ACCOUNTS of Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity in India!"" Mamata Banerjee, the state's chief minister, wrote in a tweet. ""Their 22,000 patients & employees have been left without food & medicines. While the law is paramount, humanitarian efforts must not be compromised,"" Banerjee, an opposition leader and vocal critic of the Modi government, said. Nobel-laureate Mother Teresa, a Roman Catholic nun who died in 1997, founded the Missionaries of Charity in 1950. Head-quartered in the eastern state of West Bengal, the MoC has more than 3,000 nuns worldwide who run hospices, community kitchens, schools, leper colonies and homes for abandoned children. Officials at MoC were not immediately available for comment, while the federal home ministry said the government will issue a statement once an initial inquiry is completed. ""I urge the press to not mix financial irregularities of a charity group with religious sentiments...the decision to freeze accounts has nothing to do with Christianity,"" an official said, requesting anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media. Vicar General Dominic Gomes of the Archdiocese of Calcutta said the freeze of the West Bengal accounts was ""a cruel Christmas gift to the poorest of the poor"". RELIGIOUS CONVERSIONS? Since Modi came to power in 2014, right-wing Hindu groups have consolidated their position across states and launched small-scale attacks on religious minorities, saying their action is to prevent religious conversions. Christians and other critics say the justification of preventing conversions is false and note Christians represent only 2.3% of India's 1.37 billion people, while Hindus are the overwhelming majority. The Hindu newspaper on Monday reported disruption of Christmas celebrations at the weekend and last week, including the vandalising of a life-size statue of Jesus Christ at Ambala in Haryana, a northern state governed by Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). It also reported activists burnt a model of Santa Claus and chanted slogans against Christmas celebrations and religious conversions on Saturday outside a church in Varanasi, Modi's parliamentary constituency and Hinduism's holiest city. Anoop Shramik, a social activist in Varanasi, told Reuters he saw about two dozen people burning the Santa Claus. On Saturday, Christmas celebrations were also disrupted in Silchar, eastern Assam, after men, claiming to be members of Bajrang Dal - a right-wing group with close ties to BJP, forced their way into a church, NDTV, a local news channel reported. Contacted by telephone, the federal and state governments declined to comment on the protests. Several Indian states have passed or are considering anti-conversion laws that challenge freedom of belief and related rights that the Indian constitution guarantees to minorities. Elias Vaz, national vice-president of the All India Catholic Union, condemned the latest incidents. ""The strength of India is in its diversity and the people who have done this at Christmas are the real anti-nationals,"" Vaz said.
