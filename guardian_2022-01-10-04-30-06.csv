1/10/2022,"So Leicester are beatable after all. Few would have predicted that injury-ravaged Wasps would be the team to end the sequence but, at the 16th time of asking in all competitions, the rampant Tigers have finally been tamed. It was a deserved outcome, too, for a Wasps side who lacked 16 front line players and had to display serious character to weather a concerted late siege on their own line.  While one result does not entirely level the Midlands playing field – Leicester remain eight points ahead at the top – it will do wonders for Wasps’ self-image after a horrendous run of luck that has deprived them of many of their biggest names. On this occasion, though, they steadfastly refused to bow to the seemingly inevitable in the final quarter after three second-half penalties from Jimmy Gopperth had put them ahead with 11 minutes of an absorbing contest remaining. The Tigers have made a habit of edging close games this season but had no answer this time to Wasps’ never-say-die resilience, characterised by the man of the match, Alfie Barbeary, and replacement front-rowers Dan Frost, Zac Nearchou and Biyi Alo. Barbeary was a man possessed during the frantic finale, while Frost produced the all-important turnover in the shadow of his own posts after Leicester had closed to within one further collapsed scrum of a decisive penalty try. Wasps’ director of rugby Lee Blackett called it “as good a win as we have had this season” and could barely contain his emotional pride afterwards. “To be under that much pressure and to come away with a win is really special. It was gritty, we had to scrap and we had to fight.” Leicester’s fly-half George Ford, meanwhile, declined to grasp for excuses. “I don’t think we played anywhere near what we could but it just shows the Premiership is such a tough competition. If you’re not quite on it on the day, you’re going to lose.” His head coach, Steve Borthwick, acknowledged that Wasps’ third-quarter impetus had been crucial in transforming a contest that, until then, had seemed likely to yield a club record-equalling 16th straight Leicester win. He also diplomatically swerved an incident shortly before half time when Leicester’s frustrated captain Ellis Genge lashed out at Francois Hougaard’s face and yanked the South African’s hair. The England prop, on his 100th Leicester appearance and watched by three of England’s assistant coaches, was only shown a yellow card, but will be hoping the citing officer does not take an interest with the Six Nations starting in less than four weeks’ time. On this evidence, either way, there is very little wrong with Wasps’s spirit, despite weekend reports suggesting that three of their Kiwi mainstays, Vaea Fifita, Malakai Fekitoa and potentially Gopperth, will be leaving this summer. They clearly felt this was a day to make a statement about the perceived Midlands pecking order, despite losing Fifita and Tom West on the eve of the game through illness which necessitated a further pack reshuffle. The Tigers should have been licking their lips, but Wasps had a penalty try on the board inside four minutes when Tommy Reffell was also sin-binned for taking out Elliott Stooke close to the line. Leicester were also frustrated when a potential try for Jack van Poortvliet, following some neat approach work from Harry Potter and a weak tackle by Hougaard, was ruled out for obstruction. Ford, though, kept his side in touch with a couple of penalties and a timely ruck turnover courtesy of the evergreen Dan Cole kept the visitors’ line intact when Wasps seemed certain to score. Up the other end marched the Tigers and, seven minutes before the interval, the Argentina hooker Julián Montoya managed to satisfy the referee Tom Foley he had grounded the ball beneath a heap of bodies. Having conceded 11 penalties in the first half alone, Wasps were also initially guilty of turning the ball over too often, nullifying the bulldozing efforts of the exuberant Barbeary. The latter has been encouraged to switch from hooker to number eight by Eddie Jones but wore six here, as if to emphasise that his obvious ball in hand strength makes numbers irrelevant. The 38-year-old Gopperth, ironically wanted by Leicester, was another key figure, expertly hammering in the nails with three well-struck second-half penalties to hoist Wasps up to eighth and lift the prevailing mood. The club’s aggregate year-end financial losses since moving to Coventry are now almost £50m but when it comes to boosting collective morale days like this are absolutely priceless.",Sport/Sport,Leicester’s winning run comes to a surprise end against weakened Wasps,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/09/wasps-leicester-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
1/10/2022,"Four years ago, a defeat at the City Ground ended Arsène Wenger’s unblemished record in the FA Cup third round; now Nottingham Forest have dealt Mikel Arteta an identical similar fate. They thoroughly deserved this victory against opponents who did not manage a single shot on target all evening and whose sparkling recent form was far removed from an insipid offering. The substitute Lewis Grabban scored the winner from close range seven minutes from time and, on this showing, a pacy and intelligent Forest side should be placed significantly higher than ninth in the second tier.  Arsenal’s players cut striking figures in a one-off, whited-out kit designed to highlight their “No More Red” anti-knife crime initiative. It was a crisp look but they struggled throughout for precision against opponents who, in lining up strongly, clearly felt this tie could do their play-off hopes little harm. Steve Cooper’s team were brisk, snappy and urged on by a crowd that fancied the occasion, roaring their approval in the 10th minute when their debutant loanee from Aston Villa, Keinan Davis, squared up to Rob Holding in front of the technical areas. Holding and the Forest captain, Joe Worrall, were the only two starters who had been involved in the 2018 tie. Nuno Tavares – one of seven changes forced by injury, Covid and the Africa Cup of Nations to the Arsenal side that ran Manchester City close last Saturday – threatened to increase the prospects of another upset with a bizarre intervention as proceedings continued to fizz. His right-footed backpass towards Bernd Leno was wildly overhit and aimed at chest height, forcing the keeper to awkwardly concede a corner. The visitors’ threat in the opening quarter was limited to a shot that Ben White pulled wide of the near post. Arteta had been able to select a familiar attacking midfield trio of Bukayo Saka, Martin Ødegaard and Gabriel Martinelli but there was more of a scratch feel elsewhere. Charlie Patino, the gifted 18-year-old whose debut in the Carabao Cup last month brought a goal against Sunderland, was given his first start in midfield alongside Albert Sambi Lokonga. Sliding into a sharp challenge inside 40 seconds, Patino quickly showed an understanding that steel would be required alongside technical grace. Forest forced the tempo through Djed Spence, a rangy wing-back who restricted Martinelli on the Arsenal left while frequently exposing Tavares, and the speed of Brennan Johnson. Philip Zinckernagel probed and teased around them, standing up a delicate cross from the byline that begged to be attacked. Nobody did and, for all their bright work, Forest had not managed a shot of note by half-time. Not that Arsenal achieved significantly more. Holding screwed an ambitious volley out for a throw-in but they asserted a degree of control after the half-hour. Saka and Lokonga both saw efforts deflected off target, the latter’s strike at least causing Brice Samba brief concern in Forest’s goal, but an agitated Arteta did not look especially happy. He made that crystal clear in replacing the struggling Tavares, who did not appear to be injured, with Kieran Tierney in the 34th minute. Tavares needs to seize chances such as this one and he knew it, judging by a frustrated reaction before he sat down. Daniel Podence bagged two and Nélson Semedo was also on the scoresheet as Wolves breezed into the fourth round of the FA Cup with a 3-0 win over Sheffield United at Molineux. Wolves were given a couple of reprieves following some uncharacteristically disjointed defending early on but Podence opened the scoring inside the first quarter of an hour and, from there, the hosts hardly looked back. They had to wait until the 72nd minute for Semedo to double their lead before Podence grabbed his second soon after, the forward's first goals since scoring in the Carabao Cup defeat against Tottenham on 22 September. Billy Sharp thought he had equalised before half-time but the goal was chalked off for a high foot as the Blades endured an unhappy return to the ground where their relegation from the Premier League last season was confirmed. Nathan Jones was happy to see his Luton side shake off their ring rust as they cruised past Harrogate 4-0 to move into the fourth round of the FA Cup. The Hatters went into the game having not played for 29 days due to outbreaks of Covid but, despite their lack of action, they eased home thanks to goals from Elijah Adebayo, Cameron Jerome, Kal Naismith and Luke Berry. Jones said: ""We haven't played any football in a month, we've given them a big week this week in terms of training and in numbers as we've got to get up to speed, so it was a gamble … We've managed to win the game 4-0, so it's not a bad world is it?"" Mark Harris fired a late extra-time winner as Cardiff beat Preston 2-1 in the Welsh capital. Harris's first goal in the competition came with the third-round tie just four minutes from a penalty shootout. Isaak Davies, another of the Bluebirds' young guns, had earlier scored his first senior goal before Daniel Johnson's penalty put Preston back on terms. Davies' strike after 42 minutes was a particularly sweet moment for the Wales Under-21 international. Cardiff's manager, Steve Morison, had described Davies as being more ""a hindrance than a help"" after sending him on as a substitute at Bournemouth only to replace him within 30 minutes. Tom Ince's first-half goal and a late Tyrese Campbell strike earned Stoke a 2-0 win over Leyton Orient. Ince netted three minutes from half-time and then provided the pass for substitute Campbell to settle the contest in the 89th minute. PA Media Inspiration had come a distant second to perspiration at both ends. Spence attempted to reverse that order within a minute of the restart but sliced a cross-shot behind after another strong run. It was another strong start from Forest, Zinckernagel sparking plaintive shouts for a penalty after falling easily in the box, although Eddie Nketiah saw Steve Cook block his shot as Arsenal countered and had his ears warmed by a well-positioned Saka to his right. The game’s first shot on target came within a whisker of producing its opening goal. Zinckernagel took it, forcing Leno to tip around his post smartly after connecting 12 yards out, but the chance owed everything to the highly rated Johnson. He flipped the ball over his own head on halfway and showed Holding a clean pair of heels before centring accurately for his teammate; it was an electric piece of initiative but, moments later, Arsenal should have rendered it a distant memory. Nketiah had the goal at his mercy when found unmarked by Saka just before the hour but got his header all wrong, sending it away from goal. Although a bit-part player, Nketiah usually dispatches such openings and Forest had received a major let-off. For the first time, a goal for either side did not seem a tall order. James Garner drew a parry from Leno with a meatily struck free-kick from 30 yards. Nketiah blazed over from an angle and was joined up front by Alexandre Lacazette, who replaced the neat but quiet Patino. Strong defending from Worrall prevented Lacazette from converting another Saka delivery. It was another replacement striker, though, who struck the decisive blow. Grabban had come on for Davis and, when Johnson intercepted Lokonga’s loose pass, he smelled a chance to showcase his own predatory gifts. Johnson sent Ryan Yates down the right and Grabban, haring into the box, clinically converted his cross on the stretch. A mini pitch invasion ensued and, at full time, so did more rapturous celebrations.",Sport/Football,Lewis Grabban’s late show for Nottingham Forest stuns Arsenal in FA Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/09/nottingham-forest-arsenal-fa-cup-match-report
1/10/2022,"Furniture retailer Ikea has cut sick pay for unvaccinated UK staff who are forced to self-isolate because of close contact with someone with Covid-19, it has emerged. Unvaccinated workers at Ikea are only eligible for statutory sick pay of £96.35 a week during 10 days of isolation, compared with weekly pay of more than £400 before tax for an average worker on the shop floor.  However, managers at the retailer, which employs 10,000 staff in the UK, will consider mitigating circumstances. Some employers have experimented with incentives for workers to get vaccinated, including free time off during work hours, but Ikea and utility company Wessex Water, have joined supermarket Morrisons in imposing a financial cost on those without an exemption who decline to be vaccinated. People in England who are fully vaccinated – with at least two doses of most of the approved vaccines – are not required to self-isolate if they have been in close contact with someone infected with Covid-19. However, unvaccinated people contacted through the government’s test-and-trace system must still self-isolate by law. Other nations of the UK have set similar rules. Ikea’s policy was first introduced in September, while Wessex Water will implement the cut on Monday. The Mail on Sunday first reported the policies. Wessex Water, which serves 2.8 million customers in the South West of England, has taken action after enduring record Covid-19-related absences during the past week. Workers self-isolating because they are infected with Covid-19 will still be paid their full wage. An Ikea spokesperson said: “We appreciate that this is an emotive topic and all circumstances will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, anyone in doubt or concerned about their situation is encouraged to speak to their manager.” A Wessex Water spokesperson said: “The vast majority of our workforce has been vaccinated and it’s important as a company providing essential services with key-worker employees [that] the remainder get vaccinated to protect themselves, customers and their colleagues. To make it easy for our staff, vaccine appointments can be booked in work time. “Absences due to Covid have doubled in the last week, so we need everyone to be available so we can continue to provide uninterrupted essential water and sewerage services.” Wessex Water said that throughout the pandemic it had not furloughed staff, and anyone who had to self-isolate after contracting Covid received full pay. In some countries, including in the US, companies have insisted that staff receive coronavirus vaccines or else pay monthly fees, in the case of Delta Air Lines, or even lose their jobs at employers such as United Airlines, tech company Google and Citigroup, one of the world’s largest banks. French president Emmanuel Macron has also pledged to “piss off” unvaccinated people (who are not exempt) by making daily life slightly more difficult for them. Employment experts have suggested that “no jab, no job” policies would be difficult for companies in the UK to enforce because of stronger worker protections and rules against discrimination. However, UK care workers have been obliged to be vaccinated since November.",News/World news,Ikea cuts sick pay for unvaccinated UK staff isolating due to close Covid contact,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/09/ikea-cuts-sick-pay-for-unvaccinated-uk-staff-isolating-due-to-close-covid-contact
1/10/2022,"A trove of 209 Roman coins in a cave in northern Spain – hailed by researchers as an “exceptional find” – is believed to have been uncovered by a badger desperately foraging for food. The coins, dating from between the third and fifth century AD, were spotted in a cave in the municipality of Grado in the northern region of Asturias. They were found mere feet from the den of a badger, months after Storm Filomena dumped heavy snow across swaths of the country.  Researchers believe that the snow forced the badger to step up its foraging efforts, leaving it prodding at a small crack near its den in hopes of uncovering berries or worms. Instead it appears that the animal hit on a stockpile of worn Roman coins, forged in places as far away as Constantinople and Thessaloniki, archaeologist Alfonso Fanjul Peraza told El País newspaper. Most of the coins are made of copper and bronze and the largest, weighing more than eight grams and containing 4% silver, is believed to have been forged in London. “To date, this is the largest treasure trove of Roman coins found in a cave in northern Spain,” the researchers said in a recently published report. It is not the first time archaeologists have uncovered treasure in the dense woodlands of Grado; about 85 years ago, 14 gold coins dating to the reign of Constantine were found in the area. “The accumulation of significant finds could – with caution – be seen as a response to the intense conflict experienced in the border territory,” said Fanjul. The Romans conquered the Iberian peninsula in 218BC, ruling until they were ousted by the Visigoths in the early fifth century. Researchers have speculated that the latest trove of coins were likely part of a larger haul that was hastily hidden in hopes of keeping them safe amid political and social instability. The find marks the first phase of the project, and researchers hope to return to the area for further excavations, Fanjul told reporters earlier this year. “We want to know if it was a one-off hiding place or if there was a group of humans living there.”",News/World news,Hungry badger may have uncovered Roman coins in Spanish cave,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/09/hungry-badger-may-have-uncovered-roman-coins-in-spanish-cave
1/10/2022,"Arsenal’s manager, Jonas Eidevall, conceded that the shock 2-0 defeat of the Women’s Super League leaders at Birmingham City, who began the day rooted to the bottom of the table, was “100% my responsibility”. Libby Smith scored her first WSL goal in the third minute to give the hosts the lead and Veatriki Sarri added a second before the break to complete the win in which Arsenal always looked second best.  “There were a number of occasions during the game when we lost the ball at the wrong times and didn’t have a good structure around the ball which meant the counter attacks hurt us,” said the Swedish manager. “We didn’t play well enough under their pressure, and we didn’t break their low block down well enough, so very disappointed with our performance today.” Arsenal had been unbeaten in the league while the Blues were without a win. However, with the former Birmingham player Darren Carter in place as interim manager following the dismissal of Scott Booth in November, Birmingham look a far more organised and potent force. “We weren’t naive enough to think we were going to dominate the ball or territory in the game,” explained Carter. “We knew out of possession we’d have to be good in our structure and shape and the players executed that so so well. We’re asking them to put in a lot of hard work and we asked them to empty the tank. We knew we had finishers on the bench ready to come on but I didn’t make a sub until the 90th minute because they gave us everything.” Lucy Quinn’s pass to release Smith early on caught out Arsenal’s defence and she slotted coolly past Manuela Zinsberger in goal. Sarri delivered the hammer blow to the Gunners’ hopes of getting back into the game three minutes before half-time, finishing a move she had begun and firing in after Jen Beattie failed to clear and Frida Maanum failed to track her run. Having conceded 10 goals in 19 games in all competitions up to December, Arsenal have since conceded 13 in five and the team’s defensive woes and organisational incoherence look far from over. With Chelsea’s home game against Tottenham – alongside West Ham’s match with Manchester United and Aston Villa’s with Everton – postponed due to Covid outbreaks, Arsenal maintain a four-point lead over Emma Hayes’ side but have played a game more.

1/10/2022,"Reports on Sunday that free lateral flow tests could be axed under a strategy of living with Covid within weeks were met with a swift backlash. The government promptly denied the suggestion that free tests could soon be scrapped. The story highlights a gulf in opinions on what “living with Covid” might look like, with some saying we will achieve this only through continued caution and others equating the phrase to ditching all Covid measures and partying like it’s 2019.  Wherever your instincts lie, it is not surprising – or even undesirable – that the mass testing of asymptomatic people is being reviewed. The policy was rapidly brought in at a time when, faced with a new, highly infectious variant of unknown virulence, it made sense to throw everything we had at Omicron to slow down transmission and to minimise disruption caused by essential workers having to self-isolate. With case numbers wildly outstripping the UK’s laboratory testing capacity, lateral flow tests continue to be vital for tracking case numbers. However, these tests are not ultimately “free”. More than £6bn in public funding has been spent on lateral flow test kits. As the Omicron wave recedes, the use of lateral flow tests needs to be justified as part of a wider public health policy. Undoubtedly, the tests pick up some cases that would have gone under the radar. They also provide reassurance to people. However, we need much better real-world evidence on the most effective way to target testing. It is likely that this would continue to include screening healthcare workers and carers of vulnerable people. It is not clear, in the future, that it would extend to people routinely monitoring themselves before attending social events. Some question why the government is even thinking about how we can “live with Covid” in the same week that case numbers have hit record highs. But mapping out the path to normality does not have to equate to misguided optimism that we have already arrived at this destination. In advice given in November, before the emergence of Omicron, Sage scientists predicted it would take “at least five years” for Covid-19 to settle into an endemic state and that this path would be critically dependent on factors such as the rate of waning of immunity and chosen policies on vaccination and surveillance. Active management would be required for at least the next five years, during which time there would remain a realistic risk of “epidemics of sufficient size to overwhelm health and care services”, they said. While five years may sound disappointingly distant, the advice also reminds us that we are not powerless in steering our course and that, as time goes on, the uncertainties will decrease. We know now, for instance, that immunity against severe illness appears to be holding up well and that second boosters will not be immediately necessary. Within the next few months, it will become clear whether we can hold off until the autumn, which would bring Covid boosters roughly in line with annual flu jabs. “Living with Covid” does not have to mean reversing every protective measure. If better ventilation and face masks reduce the impact of winter respiratory illnesses, that is a positive, even if the NHS is no longer under imminent threat of being overwhelmed. We will also need to remain vigilant about the threat from new variants, which could still cause big setbacks. There is no guarantee that another variant, more infectious and more virulent than Omicron, could emerge in the future. Scientists say that supporting global vaccination efforts will be crucial to securing the path to normality.",News/World news,‘Living with Covid’ does not have to mean ditching all protective measures,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/09/living-with-covid-does-not-have-to-mean-ditching-all-protective-measures
1/10/2022,"Antonio Conte bemoaned Tottenham’s laboured performance in their 3-1 FA Cup victory against Morecambe on a day when a section of the club’s fans turned on the record signing Tanguy Ndombele. Conte needed to introduce Lucas Moura and Harry Kane as 69th-minute substitutes – together with Oliver Skipp – as a heavily rotated lineup trailed 1-0 against the League One strugglers. The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium support booed Ndombele when he took an age to leave the field after Conte’s decision to replace him with Skipp. But Spurs turned the game around late on, Harry Winks’s equaliser being followed by goals from Lucas and Kane.  “In the first part of the game, for a big part of the game, we struggled,” Conte said. “In this type of game you have to score and, when you concede, for sure your opponent starts to feel they can beat you. We struggled to be creative and also to score goals. We had some chances but not too many. “At the end, we have to be a bit disappointed because we can do much better. In the end, it’s OK. We mustn’t be happy, for sure, but we reached the target and that’s all. We have to do much better and also to know that we have to struggle. We have to know that if the situation is this, we have to be prepared to struggle this season.” Ndombele, who started for only the third time under Conte, did not break his slow stride as the fans reacted negatively to him when he went off. But the manager was keen to downplay the flashpoint. “This type of situation, they are in football,” Conte said. “You have to be good to change the opinions. I was a player and it happened sometimes to me that someone was unhappy with my performance. “This is our life. It’s OK. We have to continue to work and try to be better next time.

1/10/2022,"No Italian has ever voted for Mario Draghi in an election, but given the opportunity it seems that many might choose to do so. Recent polls indicate that Italy’s technocrat prime minister, appointed last February by the country’s president, Sergio Mattarella, basks in stellar approval ratings of about 65%. As honeymoon periods go, this one has justified the “Super Mario” hype that accompanied Mr Draghi’s installation. The explanation for his success lies in the unaccustomed sense of stability and calm that the former head of the European Central Bank has delivered. Since taking office, following the mid-Covid implosion of a centre-left coalition government, Mr Draghi has presided with authority over a unity administration that involves every party apart from the far-right Brothers of Italy. Rome’s Covid recovery plan is being enthusiastically funded by the European Commission, whose officials see the prime minister as a safe pair of hands, and Italy’s handling of the pandemic on Mr Draghi’s watch has been assured. In comparison to France, where far-right demagoguery is setting the tone in the presidential race, or Britain, where the public has been scandalised by the behaviour in Boris Johnson’s Downing Street, Italian politics has distinguished itself in 2021 by being reassuringly, unusually dull.  One way or another, however, this novel interlude is coming to an end. A general election is not due until 2023, but by the end of the month a new Italian president must be installed by MPs and senators – Mr Mattarella having come to the end of his seven-year term. Silvio Berlusconi, at the age of 85, is angling for the largely ceremonial job, but Mr Draghi has emerged as the clear favourite and seems interested. His departure would severely weaken the authority of the government and increase the likelihood of early elections, which the populist right would be favourites to win. For that reason, many on the centre-left want the prime minister to stay where he is for as long as possible. So should Mr Draghi stay as PM or go to become president? The febrile speculation surrounding this question suggests that Italy, and in particular the centre-left, has become unhealthily Draghi-dependent. The Covid emergency – coinciding with a chaotic parliament in which two unstable coalitions fell apart – justified a suspension of normal politics and Mr Draghi has used the time well. His banking career and international reputation have lent Italy a new respectability in the financial markets and greater influence within the EU. There is also little doubt that the advent of a new, aggressively nationalist, rightwing government would be disastrous for Italy’s fledgling recovery and its new status in Brussels. But Mr Draghi, however accomplished and formidable an operator, should not be viewed as the primary bulwark against such a possibility. The polarisation that has characterised the country’s politics over the past decade, leading to the rise of blowhard rightwing figures such as Matteo Salvini and the Brothers of Italy leader Giorgia Meloni, can only ultimately be resolved via the ballot box. The centre-left Democratic party did well in local elections during the autumn, profiting from alliances with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement. For a proper revival of the Italian left, it now needs to find a way to build on those successes, extending its reach beyond the urban professionals who form the bedrock of its support. That task has become urgent because, after a successful pause for which Mr Draghi deserves much credit, traditional politics is set to make a comeback in Italy.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Italy’s Draghi-dependency: understandable but not healthy | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/09/the-guardian-view-on-italys-draghi-dependency-understandable-but-not-healthy
