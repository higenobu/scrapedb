4/26/2022,"TOKYO (AP) — Ukraine's government has apologized and removed a photo of Japanese wartime Emperor Hirohito from a video showing him with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini after Japan protested, officials said Monday. Japan will continue to support Ukrainians who are defending their country from Russia's invasion despite the “completely inappropriate” portrayal of Hirohito, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki said. The video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on April 1, criticized Russia's invasion as “rashism.” Underneath the photos of the three World War II-era leaders were the words “Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.” Japan fought World War II in the name of Hirohito, who was revered as a god until he renounced his divinity after Japan’s defeat. Historical evaluations of his role in the war remain divided. He is known posthumously in Japan as Emperor Showa. “Portraying Hitler, Mussolini and Emperor Showa in the same context is completely inappropriate,” Isozaki told reporters. “It was extremely regrettable.” Isozaki said Japan lodged a protest and demanded the removal of the emperor's image, which Ukraine has done. “Our sincere apologies to Japan for making this mistake,” the Ukrainian government tweeted Sunday. “We had no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan.” Ukraine Ambassador to Japan Sergiy Korsunsky also apologized in a tweet Monday, saying the creator of the video lacked an understanding of history. Hirohito's son, former Emperor Akihito, devoted his reign to atoning for the impact of the war in and outside Japan. The video has been replaced with one without Hirohito's photo, but many Japanese on social media continued to criticize the original as an insult and said Japan should stop supporting Ukraine. Others said Hideki Tojo, the Japanese wartime prime minister who was later convicted of war crimes and hanged, would have been a better choice than Hirohito for the video. Some, however, raised concern that Japan’s demand that the video be revised was censorship and said Ukraine’s concession set a bad precedent that would embolden Japanese conservatives to further rewrite Japan’s wartime history. Japan has worried that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could have an impact in East Asia, where China's military has grown increasingly assertive and has threatened to unite with Chinese-claimed Taiwan by force if necessary. Japan has tried to play a greater role as part of the Group of Seven industrialized nations in response to the invasion, joining a series of sanctions against Moscow and providing support for Ukraine in line with other members. Japan provided $300 million for Ukraine and neighboring countries that have accepted displaced Ukrainians, and has also accepted hundreds of evacuees since Russia's invasion in late February.",World/Associated Press,Ukraine removes Hirohito from video after Japan protests,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-removes-hirohito-video-japan-102440028.html
4/26/2022,"During a Monday meeting at Moscow’s Prosecutor General’s Office, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a shocking accusation, announcing the arrest of several accused assassins who were allegedly planning to kill prominent Russian state TV journalist and ardent Putin loyalist Vladimir Solovyov. “This morning, organs of the FSB halted the activities of a terrorist group that was planning an attack and a murder of a prominent Russian TV journalist,” Putin stated, claiming that the plot was orchestrated by “high-ranking diplomatic officials in Europe and the United States” who are striving to divide Russian society and “destroy Russia from within.” Putin alleged that the West’s failure to prevail on the information front of the war in Ukraine has prompted it “to resort to terror, to arrange the killings of our journalists.” He added: “We know the names of the sponsors from Western intelligence agencies, first of all—of course—from the United States’ CIA, which are working with Ukraine’s security services.” Russia’s notorious FSB counterintelligence agency released a video of the arrests, as well as so-called “behind-the-scenes” footage of agents searching and seizing property allegedly found at the suspects’ apartment, which was posted in its entirety by state media outlet RIA Novosti on Telegram. The footage showed an array of items laid out in the apartment, including a photograph of Adolf Hitler, six pristine-looking Ukrainian passports, a blonde wig, and brand new T-shirts emblazoned with swastikas that appeared to bear fresh creases from recent shipping. But the seemingly brand new items weren’t the only curious elements depicted in the FSB video footage. In the original video, three copies of a Sims video game were shown laid out on the bed, as well as a book containing a menacing inscription, stating in part: “Kill to live and live to kill,” signed with the name of “Signature unclear.” Social media users were quick to point that the SIMS game and “Signature unclear” could be signs that the arrest was part of an FSB hoax gone wrong, pointing out the directives for setting up the scene of the crime might have included planting three SIM cards and signing the book with an indiscernible signature—and that these instructions might have been misunderstood or taken too literally by the agents. Perhaps realizing their agents have flubbed, official videos posted by the FSB on its YouTube channel excluded the book and blurred the images of the SIMS video games. Russian FSB has fabricated a ""plot"" to kill Russian TV propagandist Solovyov. Allegedly by Ukrainian SBU and Nazis. One of the ""evidences"" is neonazi inscription on a book. Signed by ""Signature unclear"". Yes, FSB got an order to sign it with a ""signature unclear"" - and did so! pic.twitter.com/P1vnDOXOIB — Sergej Sumlenny (@sumlenny) April 25, 2022 Despite obvious holes in the official narrative of the so-called assassination plot, the Kremlin appears to be sticking with its story. On Monday, director of the Russian Federal Security Service Alexander Bortnikov told Russia’s Rossiya-1 channel that a group of six Russian neo-Nazis were indeed planning to kill state TV host Vladimir Solovyov on the orders of Ukraine’s Security Services. In his interview with the state media outlet RIA Novosti, Solovyov said he didn’t notice being followed and profusely thanked the FSB for saving his life. But the groundwork for Monday’s accusations seems to have been laid out days prior: two days before the arrests, Solovyov claimed that during his morning jog, he was accosted by unknown harassers. “I was jogging down the embankment today, as two fat bastards have driven past me on their bicycles, yelling ‘Glory to Ukraine,’” he said during his show Solovyov Live. “They were too scared to stop and get punched by me right into their greasy faces. We’ll trace and find them, no question, because it’s all on video... We need to catch all the scumbags over here.” Solovyov, a vocal supporter of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, baselessly accused Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky of spearheading the alleged plot to assassinate him, and claimed to have been targeted because he is a Jewish journalist. Rossiya-1 reported that the “Neo-Nazi assassins” admitted to planning the murder of other state media personalities, showing a clip of one unnamed plotter whose face was blurred who said they had also planned to take out state TV host Dmitry Kiselyov, head of RT Margarita Simonyan, her husband Tigran Keosayan, as well as pro-Putin pundits Olga Skabeeva and Evgeny Popov. Inside The Bizarre Conspiracy Theory That Halted Putin’s Bombing Plans During a Monday evening broadcast of state TV show 60 Minutes, Olga Skabeeva concluded: “Ukraine officially became the sponsor of terrorism.” Earlier in April, during his phone call with U.S. President Joe Biden, Zelensky had asked for the United States to designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. Today’s allegations seek to bounce that accusation back into Ukraine’s lap. Opening his evening show on Monday, Solovyov seemed positively giddy while discussing the alleged plot to kill him. He chuckled about having to answer calls and give interviews about the arrests, and laughed about how the president of Ukraine must have orchestrated the scheme out of professional jealousy. As it turns out, Solovyov didn’t seem to be taking the alleged attempts on his life half as seriously as he did the seizure of his Italian villas due to Western sanctions.

The pill, S-217622, ""demonstrated rapid clearance of the infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus"", Shionogi said in a statement, citing Phase-2b results from the Phase II/III clinical trial of the drug. The company has global aspirations for the antiviral pill, which is now being evaluated by Japanese regulators. The findings released on Sunday also showed ""there was no significant difference in total score of 12 COVID-19 symptoms between treatment arms"" although the drug showed improvement in a composite score of five ""respiratory and feverish"" symptoms, Shionogi said.

4/26/2022,"Racially motivated violence looks like the mass shootings that killed Xiaojie Tan, Daoyou Feng, Chung Park, Hyun Grant and Suncha Kim in Atlanta on March 16, 2021. Racially motivated violence also looks like suicide, which is defined as a deliberate act of self-directed violence in order to cause injury to oneself that results in death. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. When broken down by race, suicide is the first leading cause of death among Asian American young adults age 15-24. This is true of no other racial group in this age range in America. Despite this disparity, very little attention is paid by society and by gatekeeping institutions like academe and private and public funding agencies as to what causes suicidal behavior among racial minorities like Asian Americans. There is not enough research on how to prevent suicide among Asian Americans in particular. What makes this research more challenging to do is that Asian Americans are also the least likely racial group to seek and utilize mental health services. I am a doctoral candidate studying public health, with a focus on minority mental health disparities research. Here’s what I think is important to know about how violence, suicide and disparities all connect to affect Asian American lives. When an Asian American death occurs by suicide, it is not simply because that person experienced risk factors. Sure, the evidence suggests that the risk of a suicide attempt increases if there are easily accessible means such as guns in the home or if the person knows someone who died by suicide. But is that the full picture for Asian Americans, or even for other racial minorities? The truth is, the people who study suicide are still trying to come up with a profile of who is “at risk” in order to precisely predict, and ultimately prevent, suicidal behavior and death. Today, many research dollars go into the development of computer algorithms and genetic biomarkers to precisely calculate who is at risk. Will these methods do justice to the racialized experience of being Asian American in the U.S.? So the question now becomes: How can research scientists better understand and develop suicide prevention efforts that precisely address racial minorities like Asian Americans? To answer this question, there must first be research on Asian Americans to study. Unfortunately, the first, only and last study that assesses national epidemiological prevalence estimates of mental disorders in the Asian American community occurred and was published in the early 2000s, nearly two decades ago. Since these data were collected, the U.S. Asian population grew 72% by 2015, making Asians the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group, surpassing Hispanics. In my view, suicide among Asian Americans is a seriously unaddressed problem that could become endemic in a rapidly growing community with little to no direction on how to stop it. What if there was a way to scientifically account for racism as the fundamental cause of health disparities? The answer lies in understanding stigma. Stigmatized identity is arguably a universal phenomenon. People who are stigmatized are unwanted by society, negatively stereotyped, rejected and excluded, and ultimately othered. Asian Americans have experienced this kind of stigmatization institutionally since the early years of modern America as racial categorizations began to solidify. As America continues to racialize Asian Americans, it continues a legacy of structural violence and historical trauma. This means that anti-Asian violence exists within the very fabric of American society. It is this societal oppression and violence that becomes internalized into self-hatred, self-harm and ultimately the self-directed violence that is suicide. When it comes to being Asian in America, though, the story is incomplete with looking only at race. There are plenty of violently oppressive systems that Asian Americans face that pile on the risk of self-directed violence. These are intersecting in nature. It is the intersectionality, or cross-sections, of Asian American identity that must be closely investigated to uncover insights into suicide prevention for this incredibly diverse community. Being an immigrant and experiencing xenophobia, for example, is a dominant experience for many Asian Americans. Although many have lived in the United States for several generations, Asian Americans do account for a large portion of today’s adult second generation. Second-generation immigrants are people who are native-born citizens in the United States and have at least one parent who is foreign-born. What makes this important to know? Current trends indicate that the U.S. is explosively growing into an immigrant-rich nation. More than 36% of all Americans are projected to be of immigrant origin – that’s first- or second-generation – by 2050. By that time, the overwhelming majority – 93% – of the country’s working-age population will be of immigrant origin, too. Here’s the problem: Second-generation immigrants are considered an at-risk group for suicidal behavior and death by researchers across the world. Researchers aren’t fully sure why yet, and that’s why this research is so timely. Research takes decades to implement. It also takes decades to figure out the problem and how to address it. The public health scientists who work on disparities research are aware of the complex problems facing minority populations like Asian Americans. If there were an intervention to end racism and xenophobia, perhaps many Asian American lives would be saved both from homicide and suicide. The reality is that white supremacy runs so deep in America that even reversing racism would not undo the disparities in health outcomes such as suicide. This is because assimilation is “traumagenic.” That means the traumatic exposures of racist and xenophobic violence and discrimination hold the power to disrupt psychological and physiological functioning and alter genetic code for generations to come. Race-based traumatic stress holds the power to predispose entire populations, entire communities like Asian Americans, to self-directed violence. In my view, what is left to do is to work to change the norms of inclusion. It won’t take years of research to do that. Just start now. Act locally. Here’s a first step.

4/26/2022,"By Oleksandr Kozhukhar and Pavel Polityuk LVIV, Ukraine/KYIV (Reuters) - Russia told the world not to underestimate the considerable risks of nuclear war that it said it wanted to reduce and warned that conventional Western weapons were legitimate targets in Ukraine, where battles raged in the east. ""The risks now are considerable,"" foreign minister Sergei Lavrov told Russia's state television according to a transcript of an interview on the ministry's website. ""I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real. And we must not underestimate it."" Lavrov had been asked about the importance of avoiding World War Three and whether the current situation was comparable to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, a low point in U.S-Soviet relations. Russia had lost its ""last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine,"" Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter after Lavrov's interview. ""This only means Moscow senses defeat."" During a visit to Kyiv, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin promised more military aid for Ukraine. But Moscow's ambassador to Washington told the United States to halt shipments, warning Western weapons were inflaming the conflict. Lavrov said: ""NATO, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war."" Russia's two-month-old invasion of Ukraine, the biggest attack on a European state since 1945, has left thousands dead or injured, reduced towns and cities to rubble, and forced over 5 million people to flee abroad. Moscow calls its actions a ""special operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists. Ukraine and the West says this a false pretext for an unprovoked war of aggression by President Vladimir Putin. Russia has yet to capture any of the biggest cities. Its forces were forced to pull back from the outskirts of Kyiv in the face of stiff resistance. ""It is obvious that every day - and especially today, when the third month of our resistance has begun - that everyone in Ukraine is concerned with peace, about when it all be over,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Monday. ""There is no simple answer to that at this time."" The U.S. State Department on Monday used an emergency declaration to approve the potential sale of $165 million worth of ammunition to Ukraine. The Pentagon said the package could include artillery ammunition for howitzers, tanks and grenade launchers. The United States is due to host an expected gathering of more than 40 countries this week for Ukraine-related defense talks that will focus on arming Kyiv, U.S. officials said. Britain said all tariffs on goods coming into the country from Ukraine under an existing free trade deal will be axed and it would send new ambulances, fire engines, medical supplies and funding for health experts to help the emergency services. Putin on Monday said the West had failed to divide Russian society and accused it of inciting Kyiv to plan attacks on Russian journalists, in comments dismissed by Ukraine's security service. NORMAL LIFE RETURNING IN KYIV Just weeks ago, the capital Kyiv was a frontline city under curfew and bombardment, with tens of thousands of troops on its northern outskirts and residents sheltering from artillery in its metro stations. Today, the nearest Russian soldiers are hundreds of miles away, and normal life is coming back to the capital, with Western leaders visiting and diplomats returning. Blinken said U.S. diplomats would first come to the western city of Lviv and should be back in Kyiv within weeks. Bridget Brink, now U.S. ambassador in Slovakia, will be the envoy. But away from the capital, war rages on in Ukraine's east and south where Russia last week launched a massive offensive. Russia's defence ministry said its missiles destroyed six facilities powering the railways that were used to deliver foreign weapons to Ukrainian forces in the eastern Donbas region. Reuters could not verify the report. Russian forces were continuing on Monday to bomb and shell the vast Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol where fighters are hunkered down in a city ravaged by a siege and bombardment, Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said. Moscow said it was opening a humanitarian corridor to let civilians out of the plant but Kyiv said no agreement had been reached and appealed to the United Nations for help in reaching one as ""initiator and guarantor"". Russia's defence ministry said Ukraine had undermined evacuation efforts and that nobody had left the steel works via the humanitarian corridors on Monday. Russia's deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy told reporters a ceasefire was not a good option and would only allow Ukrainian forces to regroup, though it was not his decision. Ukraine's general staff also reported Russian shelling of its second-biggest city, Kharkiv, in the northeast as well as towns and villages to the south, but said that assaults on three settlements were repelled.

McConnell added that Trump, whom he hasn't spoken to since December 2020, was ""despicable,"" it says. In the immediate hours after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was optimistic that the violent riot had finally discredited former President Donald Trump, according to two New York Times reporters. ""I feel exhilarated by the fact that this fellow finally, totally discredited himself,"" McConnell told the New York Times reporter Jonathan Martin in the hours after the attack, adding that Trump ""was pretty thoroughly discredited by this."" That's according to an excerpt from ""This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden, and the Battle for America's Future,"" a forthcoming book from Martin and his fellow Times reporter Alex Burns, that was published by The Washington Post on Monday. ""He put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger,"" McConnell said while standing in a doorway of the Capitol after midnight, according to the excerpt. ""Couldn't have happened at a better time."" The book says McConnell also asked Martin, ""What do you hear about the Twenty-Fifth Amendment?"" hoping to gain insight into whether members of Trump's Cabinet were interested in removing the president. According to the book, McConnell called Trump a ""despicable person"" in a meeting with staffers late into the evening after the attack. But while McConnell hasn't spoken to Trump since December 2020 — once the Electoral College had affirmed then-President-elect Joe Biden's victory — he later backed down from the idea of impeaching Trump, citing a legal argument popular among Republican senators that impeaching a former president was not appropriate. ""I didn't get to be leader by voting with five people in the conference,"" McConnell told a friend, according to the book. ""If President Trump were still in office, I would have carefully considered whether the House managers proved their specific charge,"" McConnell said on the floor the day the Senate acquitted Trump.

4/26/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) -President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the West of trying to destroy Russia, demanding prosecutors take a tough line with what he cast as plots hatched by foreign spies to divide the country and discredit its armed forces. Speaking to Russia's top prosecutors and watched by his defence minister, Putin accused the West of inciting Ukraine to plan attacks on Russian journalists - an allegation denied by Kyiv. Putin said the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, the Federal Security Service (FSB), had on Monday prevented a murder attempt by a ""terrorist group"" on Russian TV journalist Vladimir Solovyev. ""They have moved to terror - to preparing the murder of our journalists,"" Putin said of the West. Putin, a former KGB spy who has ruled Russia as paramount leader since the last day of 1999, did not immediately provide evidence to support his statements and Reuters was unable to immediately verify the accusations. FSB chief Alexander Bortnikov said a group of six neo-nationalist Russian citizens had plotted to kill Solovyev - one of Russia's most high-profile TV and radio journalists - at the behest of Ukraine's State Security Service (SBU). The SBU denied the allegations, which it said were fantasies cooked up by Moscow. ""The SBU has no plans to assassinate V. Solovyev,"" it said in a statement. Solovyev, a host of talk shows whose guests often denigrate Ukraine and justify Moscow's actions there, thanked the FSB. RUSSIA THE TARGET Putin said the West had realised that Ukraine could not beat Russia in war so had moved to a different plan - the destruction of Russia itself. ""Another task has come to the fore: to split Russian society and destroy Russia from within,"" Putin said. ""It is not working."" Putin said foreign media organisations and social media had been used by the West's spies to confect provocations against Russia's armed forces. Prosecutors should react swiftly to fake news and reports that undermined order, Putin said, without giving any specific examples. ""They are often mainly organised from abroad, organised in different ways - either the information comes from there or the money,"" Putin said. Prosecutors should fight extremism ""more actively"", Putin said. Just days after ordering the invasion of Ukraine, Putin signed a law that imposes a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally ""fake"" news about the military. Russia says the Western media have provided an excessively partial narrative of the war in Ukraine that largely ignores Moscow's concerns about the enlargement of NATO and what it says is the persecution of Russian speakers in Ukraine. Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced millions more and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States - by far the world's two biggest nuclear powers. Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Ukraine was guilty of the genocide of Russian-speaking people. Ukraine says it is fighting a land grab by Russia and that Putin's accusations of genocide are nonsense.

I hope you would sponsor bills that support positive mental health for each citizen of the state of Missouri instead of proposing bills that attack a population already at risk.

4/26/2022,"Avi Loeb, astronomy’s resident bad boy, suggests the universe may have been created in a laboratory. Our supposed creators, Loeb writes in an op-ed published in Scientific American last year, may have developed the technology needed to construct “baby universes” capable of producing life. He also introduces a new classification system for advanced civilizations. Could our universe have been created in a petri dish? Avi Loeb seems to think so. The Harvard astronomer posits that a higher “class” of civilization may have conjured up our universe in a laboratory far, far away. “Since our universe has a flat geometry with a zero net energy, an advanced civilization could have developed a technology that created a baby universe out of nothing through quantum tunneling,” Loeb writes in an op-ed published by Scientific American last year. This theory, he suggests, would unite two seemingly opposite notions: the idea that a higher power might be driving our fate, and the secular concept of quantum gravity (a field of physics that seeks to work gravity into the theory of quantum mechanics—something that, to the bane of physicists everywhere, we haven’t been able to do yet on Earth). Primarily, this theory hinges on a far-off advanced civilization’s ability to meld both quantum mechanics and gravity and subsequently identify and recreate all of the universe’s ingredients. (Sounds like a lot of work, t0 be honest.) He also introduces a new way of classifying exactly what makes a civilization advanced—one that veers away from Soviet astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev’s system, which organizes civilizations based on the amount of energy they generate and consume. According to Kardashev, Type I civilizations—greetings, Earthlings!—are only advanced enough to utilize the starlight that reaches their planet (4×1012 watts), while Type II civilizations have mastered the ability to fully harness their host star’s power (4×1026 watts). Dyson sphere, anyone? Type III civilizations, the final classification in his framework, are able to harness all of the energy within their galaxy (a whopping 4×1037 watts). Loeb, by contrast, has devised a framework that breaks advanced civilizations down into classes based on their ability to “reproduce the astrophysical conditions that led to its existence.” Earthlings would fall into class C because, as a “low-level” technological civilization, we would not be able to recreate our current conditions should the sun suddenly die. (He suggests we might even fall into the class D category because we’re actively destroying our only home.) On the other hand, class B civilizations, Loeb writes, are advanced enough to recreate the conditions in which they live, independent of their host star.  A class A civilization, like our proposed creators, would be able to, say, generate large amounts of dark energy and, as Loeb suggests, create “baby universes,” or smaller universes controlled by this higher civilization, that could potentially spawn life. He also suggests that, due to competition, only one advanced civilization at a time would be able to reach this level of sophistication. It’s a truly, truly bonkers idea, but it is interesting to think about. And it brings up a set of intriguing questions: What makes a civilization truly technologically advanced? Are we an advanced simulation? What might this “laboratory” look like, anyway?

The worker wrote in The Times: ""The threat of pirate attacks is all too real. In some areas, such as along the coast of Africa in the Gulf of Aden, it's even expected. Any protective technology worth having will find its way aboard a yacht."" Superyachts tend to be adorned with luxury features that make them attractive targets for pirates. A Russian businessman's yacht that was seized in the UK in March has a fresh-water swimming pool and a wine cellar, the UK government said.

4/26/2022,"The FDA warned consumers against supplement sellers with variations of the name ""Artri"" and ""Ortiga."" These Mexico-based sellers contain dangerous, unlisted ingredients that can cause ulcers and high blood pressure. Supplement sales have skyrocketed during the pandemic, leading expert to call for more FDA oversight. The US Food and Drug Administration is cracking down on supplements sold by two Mexico-based vendors. The FDA released a consumer warning on April 20 that said supplements with variations of the name ""Artri"" or ""Ortiga"" contain dangerous hidden active ingredients not listed on the product label. The supplements are marketed as treatments for symptoms of arthritis, muscle pain, osteoporosis, and bone cancer, per the FDA. The agency's laboratory analyses revealed certain Artri and Ortiga products contain, but do not list, potentially dangerous ingredients including: Declofenac. An FDA laboratory analysis from January found Artri Ajo King contains declofenac as an unlisted ingredient. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) similar to ibuprofen and aspirin, it can lead to serious gastrointestinal problems, like ulceration and perforation, if taken incorrectly. Diclofenac sodium. The FDA found Ortiga products also typically contain diclofenac, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular events like stroke and heart attack, and may lead to ulceration or fatal perforation of the stomach and intestines. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid that has been used to treat severely ill COVID-19 patients on ventilators. It can change blood pressure, cause infections, and damage bones. Methocarbamol, a muscle relaxant used to treat pain or injury that can cause sedation and dizziness. Both Artri and Ortiga are manufactured in Mexico and are labeled primarily in Spanish, per the FDA and eBay. Supplement sales have skyrocketed since 2020, part of the wellness industry's continued growth. Scientists and medical experts have called for greater FDA oversight into over-the-counter dietary supplements, as the agency does not approve pills prior to sale the way it regulates prescription medicine. Harvard Medical School and independent product testing company NSF International identified four unapproved, unlisted stimulants in six supplements marketed for weight loss and fitness in 2017. A 2017 study in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine found the amount of melatonin in 71% of supplements is off by a 10-percent margin, meaning the majority of sellers mislabel how much of the hormone is in the pill. The study also found the amount of melatonin within pills in a single jar can vary by a whopping 465%.

More than one hundred family members, friends, and neighbors joined the funeral in Galeana, Nuevo Leon, the hometown of Debanhi's mother where the family often spent weekends and holidays. Singing hymns as they walked under the hot sun, the mourners carried white balloons and hand-written signs demanding justice for Debanhi. The teenager's body was found on Thursday night submerged in a cistern inside the grounds of a motel near where she was last seen alive.

4/26/2022,"KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan's acting defence minister said on Sunday that the Taliban administration would not tolerate ""invasions"" from its neighours after protesting against airstrikes it says were conducted by neighbouring Pakistan. The comments come after the Taliban administration blamed Pakistan for airstrikes that officials say killed dozens in Kunar and Khost provinces. Pakistan, which has not confirmed any involvement in airstrikes inside Afghanistan's borders, said the two countries are ""brotherly countries"". ""We are facing problems and challenges from both the world and our neighbors, the clear example is invasion by them in our territory in Kunar,"" said Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, acting Afghan defence minister, at a ceremony in Kabul commemorating the anniversary of the death of his father, Taliban founder Mullah Mohammad Omar. ""We can't tolerate the invasion. We have tolerated that attack. We tolerated that because of national interests, next time we might not tolerate it,"" he said. Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson said when asked for comment on Yaqoob's comments that Pakistan hoped for longterm engagement with Afghanistan to secure peace. ""Pakistan and Afghanistan are brotherly countries. The governments and people of both countries regard terrorism as a serious threat and have suffered from this scourge for long time ... therefore, it is important that our two countries engage in a meaningful manner through relevant institutional channels to cooperate in countering cross border terrorism and taking actions against terrorist groups on their soil,"" the spokesperson said.

4/26/2022,"Indonesia, a top palm-oil exporter, is planning to ban exports beginning on Thursday. Palm oil, the world's most used vegetable oil, is used in cooking and a range of consumer products. Palm-oil and competing soybean-oil prices are jumping after news of the ban. The world's top palm-oil producer announced that it would ban exports of the commodity starting on Thursday, sending the prices of edible oils soaring. Indonesia accounts for about half of the world's supply of palm oil, the world's most widely used vegetable oil. Palm oil is used for cooking and for the production of thousands of consumer products, including biscuits, detergents, and lipsticks. In a video statement on Friday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said the move was designed to bring down domestic palm-oil prices and ensure domestic food availability in the wake of global food inflation. ""I will monitor and evaluate the implementation of this policy so availability of cooking oil in the domestic market becomes abundant and affordable,"" Widodo said, a Reuters translation reported. The move comes as Indonesia has seen recent protests over the high prices of cooking oil, with retail prices gaining more than 40% so far this year, Reuters reported. The ban is expected to be in place until further notice. Indonesian palm-oil exports were worth about $30 billion in 2021, the data provider Statista showed. Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Indonesia's finance minister, told Reuters on Friday that the palm-oil ban would hurt other countries, but that it was necessary to contain the soaring domestic prices of cooking oil. Benchmark crude palm-oil futures on the Bursa Malaysia exchange jumped as much as 7% on Monday morning. They are up over 40% year to date. Prices for alternative vegetable oil also spiked in response to the impending ban on palm-oil exports in Indonesia. Benchmark Chicago soybean oil prices hit their highest levels since 2008, Reuters reported. Prices of edible oil — including palm oil — have been rising because of the war in Ukraine, as the country is a large sunflower-oil exporter. ""Edible oils are often interchangeable, so a shortage of one type exerts pressure on the others,"" Gro Intelligence, a global agriculture data-analysis firm, wrote in an April 23 note. Gains in vegetable-oil prices are outpacing overall food-price increases, Gro Intelligence wrote in the report.

Speaking to Russian news agencies, he said: ""Good will has its limits. But if it isn't reciprocal, that doesn't help the negotiation process."" He added that the Ukrainian conflict will end with an agreement but its content would depend on the military situation. It comes after Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, estimated that 15,000 Russian troops have been killed in the two months since Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine. He told MPs that Britain will send a small number of Stormer armoured vehicles fitted with launchers for anti-air missiles to Ukraine. Follow the latest updates below. Officials in the embattled Ukrainian city of Mariupol say a new mass grave has been identified north of the city. Mayor Vadym Boychenko said authorities are trying to estimate the number of victims in the grave about 6 miles north of Mariupol. Satellite photos released over the past few days have shown what appear to be images of other mass graves. Mariupol has been decimated by fierce fighting over the past two months. The capture of the city would deprive Ukraine of a vital port and allow Moscow to establish a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014. Deliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the Nato alliance is ""in essence engaged in war with Russia"" and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, Russia's foreign minister said on Monday. ""These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia's military acting within the context of the special operation,"" Sergei Lavrov told state television in an interview posted on the foreign ministry's website. ""Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?"" he said. ""Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war."" Britain is providing Ukraine with new ambulances, fire engines, medical supplies and funding for health experts to help its emergency services deal with the aftermath of Russian attacks, the Government has said. The latest batch of support will see 22 new ambulances leave for Ukraine in the coming days to join more than 40 fire engines carrying rescue equipment, thermal imaging cameras and almost 10,000 items of protective clothing which have already been dispatched there. The Government is also giving £300,000 to the medical aid charity, UK-Med, to help it train Ukrainian doctors and nurses to deal with mass casualties, as well as £300,000 worth of medicines and pharmaceutical supplies. Chuck Schumer, the US Senate Majority Leader, said he expected ""swift, bipartisan"" passage of another bill to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia once President Joe Biden submits a new funding request. While Schumer did not provide any details on the possible size of such a package, he said, ""We must continue helping the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression"" and ""I expect swift bipartisan cooperation to get it done.""

Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's Foreign Minister, said he was concerned that by visiting Moscow before traveling to Kyiv, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres could be vulnerable to falling into a Kremlin ""trap"" in the war. ""Many other foreign officials were trapped visiting Moscow and played around just to show the supremacy of Russian diplomacy and how great they are and how they dictate the world how to behave,"" he said. Guterres ""should focus primarily on one issue: evacuation of Mariupol,"" Kuleba said, referring to the the besieged city where an estimated 100,000 people are trapped while a contingent of Ukrainian fighters hold out against Russian forces in a steel mill where hundreds of civilians also are taking shelter.

The U.S. Senate needs to confirm the choice for the post, vacant since former President Donald Trump abruptly recalled then U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch in May 2019. Four people including two children were reportedly killed on Monday in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region where Russia is on the offensive, the region's governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. Russia denies targeting civilians. Kyrylenko said on Telegram that a 9-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were among those killed. The UK has today signed a contract with the Polish Government supporting the early introduction of Poland’s future short-range air defence system, Narew. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: Poland and the United Kingdom maintain a wide-ranging and important defence partnership and this move will benefit both countries, as well as the wider NATO alliance. This missile is at the forefront of threat detection and deterrence, with Poland’s Short-Range Air Defence system seeing even greater alignment between our Armed Forces. Flying at supersonic speeds, CAMM missiles can destroy modern air threats including stealth aircraft and high-speed missiles. Each CAMM family missile is equipped with an advanced active radar seeker that can see even the smallest, fastest and stealthiest targets through the worst weather and the heaviest electronic jamming. They are capable of hitting a tennis ball-sized object travelling at several times the speed of sound. President Vladimir Putin said today that Russia's economy was stabilising after being hit by unprecedented sanctions over the military campaign in Ukraine. ""The Russian economy continues to stabilise. Inflation has slowed down, the weekly rate of price growth has approached normal levels and prices for some goods have already begun to decline,"" Putin said during a televised government meeting. He added that it was due to two factors: the ruble ""actively strengthening"" and the ""dynamics of consumer demand"". ""After a spike in February-March, there is an objective decline in consumer activity,"" Putin said. Since Moscow moved troops into Ukraine on February 24, Russia has been hit with a barrage of international sanctions, including embargoes on key exports, accelerating already high inflation. While Putin has said Russia's economy weathered the sanctions well, economists believe that the worst economic impact is still to come. Greenpeace activists in Norway blocked a Russian oil tanker from unloading its cargo near Oslo for several hours Monday, saying the shipment was helping to finance Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""warfare"".

The tanker was coming from its namesake Russian city, near Saint Petersburg, according to the Marine Traffic website. Greenpeace activists in a small boat chained themselves to the ship, while others in kayaks unfurled banners reading ""oil fuels war,"" the group said. Some activists were stopped by police before they could take part in the action. After several hours, police removed 20 activists who had chained themselves to the ship, police said in a statement. Ukraine's military command said on Monday that Russia was trying to bomb Ukraine's rail infrastructure in order to disrupt arms supplies from foreign countries. ""They are trying to destroy the supply routes of military-technical assistance from partner states.

Until last weekend, the Black Sea port of Odesa had been spared the intense airstrikes and shelling that the country’s south was witnessing when the city came after the first major Russian airstrike since the war started two months ago. One of the Russian missiles that hit Odesa on Saturday landed near a hair salon. One unnamed customer filmed herself walking out of the salon, with a hair cutting cape and hair foils on. “Hello, Russian worlds, let me show you what kind of Nazis you’re fighting,” she said as she showed a bleeding wound on her hand to the camera. “We, girls, decided to fix ourselves up a bit at the hairdresser’s - and a missile fell right on our hairdresser’s. Thank you, Russian world!” In another video recorded later that day, the hair salon customer joked about how she used to wonder what chances were she could get “hit by a missile.” “One in a million,” the blonde woman with a patch on her right shoulder said. “Well, this day has come. I was saved by circumstances.” The woman said she sat with the tinfoil cap on during her colouring as she heard a whistling sound before the missile hit the building. Vladimir Putin should leave all occupied territory in Ukraine including Crimea for true peace to be achieved, the Defence Secretary has suggested, as he said it is up to Ukraine what a resolution to the war would look like. Commons Defence Select Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood asked: ""What does success in Ukraine look like? Are we doing enough to prevent Ukraine from losing but not enough to make sure that they win? What is our strategy? ""Is it to push Russia back from the pre-February lines or indeed liberate the entire Donbas region? If it is in Europe's wider security interest to see Putin humiliated in Ukraine then the entire mainland must be liberated, that must be our strategic end."" Ben Wallace replied: ""Our strategic aim is twofold. One is that Putin must fail in Ukraine, he must fail in his invasion and I think he is on course to do that actually. He must fail in his occupation of Ukraine and I think he has definitely failed in achieving that. ""To the fine tuning of that, that is as much a matter of Ukraine's choice as it is of anybody else - that Ukraine gets to choose where it wishes to settle for peace. We will do everything we can to support them. ""For my part, I want Putin not only beyond the pre-February boundaries. He invaded Crimea illegally, he invaded Donetsk illegally and he should comply with international law and in the long run leave Ukraine."" The UK risks falling behind its military allies' commitments to Nato if it does not ""reboot"" defence spending, Labour has warned. John Healey, Shadow defence secretary, told the Commons: ""I say to the Secretary of State he has given us a paragraph in his statement today on Nato. Our leadership in Nato could be at risk as Britain falls behind allies in responding to this Ukraine invasion. More than a dozen European countries are now rebooting security plans and defence spending but the UK has not yet done either. ""Can I urge him therefore to revisit the integrated review, review defence spending, reform military procurement and rethink his Army cuts? Because we will be dealing with the consequences of Putin's war for many years to come."" Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, agreed that Nato needs ""a long-term plan"", adding: ""We need to know what will Nato look like and how will western Europe or Europe including many of its new members contain Putin after all this has passed. ""Because we have a man who has clearly been involved in an illegal invasion of a country, war crimes against the Ukrainian people, and how are we going to live with that neighbour in Europe should he still remain? And that is an important consideration for all of us."" Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, said Stormer armoured vehicles will give Ukrainian forces ""enhanced, short-range anti-air capabilities both day and night"". Mr Wallace told the Commons that ""as we can see from Ukrainians' requests, more still needs to be done"". He added: ""So, for that reason I can now announce to the House that we shall be gifting a small number of armoured vehicles fitted with launchers for those anti-air missiles. ""The Stormer vehicles will give Ukrainian forces enhanced, short-range anti-air capabilities both day and night."" Ben Wallace reiterated Russia has so far ""failed in nearly every one of its objectives"", adding: ""In recognition of this failure the Russian high command has regrouped, reinforced and changed focus to securing Donetsk and Luhansk oblast."" He added in the Commons: ""At the start of this conflict Russia had committed over 120 battalion tactical groups, approximately 65% of its entire ground combat strength. ""As of now we assess around over 25% of these have been rendered not combat effective. ""Ukraine is an inspiration to us all. Their brave people have never stopped fighting for their lands. They have endured indiscriminate bombardment, war crimes and overwhelming military aggression but they have stood firm, galvanised the international community and beaten back the army of Russia in the north and the north east. ""We anticipate this next phase of the invasion will be an attempt by Russia to occupy further the Donbas and connect via Mariupol the Crimea so it's urgent that we in the international community ensure Ukraine gets the aid and weapons it so much needs."" Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, is giving a statement to the House of Commons. He told MPs: ""It is our assessment that approximately 15,000 Russian personnel have been killed during their offensive. ""Alongside the death toll are the equipment losses and in total a number of sources suggest that to date over 2,000 armoured vehicles have been destroyed or captured. ""This includes at least 530 tanks, 530 armoured personnel carriers and 560 infantry fighting vehicles. ""Russia has also lost over 60 helicopters and fighter jets. ""The offensive that was supposed to take a maximum of a week has now taken weeks."" The United States believes Kyiv can win the war against Russia if it has the ""right equipment"", Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin said today, as strikes on railway infrastructure in the central Ukraine killed at least five. A landmark visit by Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Ukraine came as the war entered its third month, with thousands killed and millions displaced by the fighting. ""The first step in winning is believing that you can win. And so they believe that we can win,"" Austin told a group of journalists after he and Blinken met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""We believe that we can win, they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support."" The meeting between the two sides lasted three hours and was ""very productive and detailed"", according to a Pentagon spokesman, adding that Zelensky was also briefed on a security summit in Germany on Tuesday among Western allies. Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations said Moscow sees no point in establishing a ceasefire in Ukraine at this stage, fearing Kyiv may use it to stage ""provocations"", RIA reported. RIA cited Dmitry Polyanskiy as saying that Russia had not struck any residential areas in Ukraine's Black Sea port city of Odesa. Ukraine's southern air command on Saturday said that two missiles struck a military facility and two residential buildings in Odesa. The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor will join an EU investigations team to probe possible international crimes committed in Ukraine, the EU's judicial cooperation agency has said. It will be the first time the Hague-based ICC - set up in 2002 as an independent tribunal to probe the world's worst crimes - will take part in a joint investigation with other countries. ""The Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague will become a participant in the joint investigation team (JIT) on alleged core international crimes committed in Ukraine,"" Eurojust said in a statement. Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor, has signed an agreement with prosecutors general of Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine to take part in a joint investigative team to look into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed since Russia's invasion on February 24. The agreement ""aims to facilitate investigations and prosecutions in the concerned states as well as those that could be taken forward before the ICC,"" Eurojust said. At least five people were killed and another 18 injured on Monday in Russian strikes on railway infrastructure in the central Ukraine region of Vinnytsia, Kyiv said. ""Preliminary information shows that five people died and 18 were injured. Rescue operations are under way, investigators, prosecutors and other services are working at the scene,"" the office of the Ukrainian prosecutor general said in a statement on social media. Moscow said it was expelling 40 German diplomats in response to the ""unfriendly decision"" by Berlin to kick out Russian diplomats over the conflict in Ukraine. Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement it summoned Germany's ambassador in Moscow and handed him a note ""declaring persona non grata forty employees of German diplomatic institutions in Russia as part of a symmetrical response"". ""A strong protest was made to the head of the German diplomatic mission in Moscow in connection with the openly unfriendly decision of the German government,"" to expel Russian diplomats, the ministry said. Earlier in April, Germany said it was expelling a ""significant number"" of Russian diplomats, amid similar moves by other European states, over Ukraine. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the decision was in response to the ""unbelievable brutality"" of Russian forces in its pro-Western neighbour Ukraine. Ukraine's State Security Service (SBU) has denied having any plans to kill Russian television host Vladimir Solovyev. It issued the denial after Russian President Vladimir Putin said the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, the Federal Security Service, had prevented a murder attempt by a ""terrorist group"" on a journalist later named by state media as Solovyev. ""The SBU has no plans to assassinate V. Solovyev,"" the SBU said in a statement published on the Telegram messaging app. More than 800 Ukrainian refugees have been waiting since March to come to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, according to would-be sponsors. British hosts frustrated by delays have compiled a spreadsheet detailing how many refugees are waiting since the sponsorship scheme opened on March 18. It shows that visa applications for at least 622 Ukrainians, sponsored by 310 UK hosts, are still outstanding after being made during the first week. A further 261 refugees, sponsored by 130 Britons, are waiting for a decision on applications made during the second week of the scheme. And 128 Ukrainians who applied under the scheme, sponsored by 43 hosts, after April 1 are still waiting. Antony Blinken, the US Secretary of State, said this morning following a trip to Kyiv yesterday that he believes ""a sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin is on the scene"". Downing Street was asked if the UK agreed with Mr Blinken. The Prime Minister's Official Spokesman said the UK is not seeking regime change in Russia but insisted ""democratically elected governments will always endure"". The spokesman said: “We are not focused on anything to do with regime change in Russia. We are focused on changing Putin’s course of action in Ukraine. “But nonetheless I think it is always clear democratically elected governments will always endure over the alternative.” Boris Johnson announced on Friday last week that the UK intended to reopen its embassy in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv this week. No 10 has now said it is hoping the embassy will be ""up and running by next week"". The Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman said: “We announced last week we are in the process of reopening the embassy. That work is taking place in earnest this week with the aim of having it up and running by next week.” The Government has announced plans to roll out further import bans and tariff increases on Russian goods, taking the total value of goods targeted to more than £1bn. The new sanctions. will include import bans on silver, wood products and high-end products from Russia including caviar. Tariffs will also be increased by 35 percentage points on around £130m worth of products from Russia and Belarus, including diamonds and rubber. International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: The UK continues to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine and is working closely with our international partners to inflict maximum damage to Putin’s regime, reducing the resources and funds he needs to carry out this illegal war. We are taking every opportunity we can to ratchet the pressure to isolate the Russian economy and these further measures will tighten the screws, shutting down lucrative avenues of funding for Putin’s war machine. Over the coming weeks, the UK will ban additional Russian goods from reaching UK shores and will also be imposing tariffs on additional products.Read more: https://t.co/U0EY9LWnnq pic.twitter.com/1QePxagCir — HM Treasury (@hmtreasury) April 25, 2022 Explosions have rocked a Russian fuel depot and logistics hub near the Ukrainian border, in a reported missile strike. Emergency services said the large fire began at around 2am Moscow time (11pm GMT) at the Transneft Bryansk-Druzhba facility in Bryansk, owned by the oil pipeline company Transneft. No injuries have been reported and the cause has not yet been established. The depot is being used to shore up Vladimir Putin's forces, prompting the Russians to launch an investigation. Bryansk is a strategic administrative centre 154 km (96 miles) northeast of the Ukrainian border, and Russian officials said last week that Ukrainian helicopters had hit residential buildings and injured seven people in the area. Footage on social media appeared to show at least two blasts lighting up the city's skyline, one at a military unit's fuel tank and the other at an oil refinery, with huge plumes of smoke and reports of evacuations. Rob Lee, from King's College London's war studies department, said the targets were within range of a Tochka-U tactical ballistic missile if deployed close to the Russia-Ukraine border. Ukrainian officials have not commented. Ukraine has denied reaching an agreement with Russia on evacuating civilians from a steel plant in Mariupol, the final pocket of resistance in the besieged southern city. Russia had said earlier on Monday that it would open a humanitarian corridor for civilians to leave the huge Azovstal plant where they are holed up with Ukrainian fighters and have come under heavy fire. ""Today, the Russian side once again announced the existence of a corridor for civilians to leave Azovstal. This could be believed if the Russians had not destroyed humanitarian corridors many times before,"" Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk wrote on the Telegram messaging app. ""It is important to understand that a humanitarian corridor opens by the agreement of both sides. A corridor announced unilaterally does not provide security, and therefore is not a humanitarian corridor."" She said Ukraine had ""appealed to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to be the initiator and guarantor of the humanitarian corridor from Azovstal for civilians."" President Joe Biden has nominated career foreign service officer Bridget Brink to be the next US ambassador to Ukraine, the White House announced on Monday. Brink, currently the US ambassador to Slovakia, speaks Russian and will fill a position that has been officially empty since 2019. She has ""spent her twenty-five-year career in the Foreign Service focused on advancing US policy in Europe and Eurasia,"" the White House said in a statement. The seasoned diplomat has also served as deputy chief of mission in US embassies in Uzbekistan and Georgia, and was stationed early in her career in Belgrade, Serbia and in Cyprus. Moscow said Monday it had arrested members of a ""neo-Nazi terrorist"" group in Russia who allegedly planned to assassinate pro-Kremlin TV anchor Vladimir Solovyov on orders from Ukraine. ""The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation detained a group of members of the neo-Nazi terrorist organisation National Socialism/White Power, which is banned in Russia,"" Russia's FSB security agency said in a statement carried by news agencies, adding that those arrested are Russian citizens. The FSB claimed the group was planning the ""murder"" of Russian TV and radio journalist Solovyov ""on the instructions of the Security Service of Ukraine"". According to the FSB, ""fake"" Ukrainian passports, arms, drugs and an improvised explosive device were found during a search of the detainees' homes. The claims come after separate allegations last month that pro-Kremlin mercenaries were planning assassination attempts on Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky, leaving his family ""terrified"". Russian president Vladimir Putin has claimed the Kremlin's main spy agency foiled what he described as a Western plot to kill a prominent Russian journalist. ""This morning, the Federal Security Service stopped the activities of a terrorist group that planned to attack and kill one famous Russian TV journalist,"" Putin told prosecutors. ""They have moved to terror - to preparing the murder of our journalists,"" Putin said. He did not immediately provide evidence to support his claims and they have not been independently verified. The Interfax news agency said that members of a nationalist group had been detained by Russian authorities. It claimed the group, acting on the orders of Ukrainian spies, was plotting to kill Russian journalist Vladimir Solovyev. Boris Johnson said it was ""very important"" to have a French president ""who can be relied upon"" on international issues such as the war in Ukraine. Emmanuel Macron defeated right-wing rival Marine Le Pen - who has previously had close ties to Vladimir Putin - to secure a second term in office. Mr Johnson told reporters this lunchtime: ""I think it's very important that we have in Paris, a president of the French Republic who can be relied upon when it comes to some of the most important international issues, and particularly when you look at what's been going on in Ukraine."" He added: ""We share a very common, very similar perspective and the unity of the West, the unity of Nato, has been absolutely vital for the stance we've taken against Putin, and that will now continue and I'm very, very reassured by that."" Russia's flagship carrier Aeroflot on Monday reported a 20 percent fall in passenger traffic in March year-on-year following tough Western sanctions over Moscow's military operation in Ukraine. Passenger traffic on international and domestic flights fell to 2.2 million in March, the first full month after the conflict began, from 2.77 million last year, the airline said Passenger traffic on international flights declined by half, it said in a statement. The Russian state owns a 57.3 stake in the group. A senior Italian politician faces calls to resign after sending a tweet featuring a capital Z, in apparent coded support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Nick Squires writes from Rome. The letter Z, a marking used by some Russian tanks, armoured vehicles and trucks, has come to represent the brutal two-month-old Russian assault on its neighbour. Critics said that Vito Petrocelli’s position as head of the commission on foreign affairs for the senate, the upper house of parliament, was no longer tenable. Mr Petrocelli wrote a tweet ostensibly wishing Italians a happy Liberation Day – April 25 is celebrated for the Allied liberation of Italy and the defeat of Italian Fascist and German Nazi forces. But he chose to write the word “liberazione” or liberation as LiberaZione, with a capital Z. Mr Petrocelli is a member of the Five Star Movement, the populist party which has had a strong pro-Moscow stance. Giuseppe Conte, the head of Five Star and a former prime minister, called the tweet “shameful”. Russia sees no risks in Moldova's breakaway region of Transdniestria, and wants a peaceful settlement of the situation there, Interfax news agency reported on Monday citing Russian deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko. Rustam Minnekayev, deputy commander of Russia's central military district, was earlier quoted by Russian state news agencies as saying full control over southern Ukraine would give it access to Transdniestria, a breakaway Russian-occupied part of Moldova in the west. This prompted Moldova to summon the Russian ambassador to express ""deep concern"" over the comments. Russia intends to discuss issues related to the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol and its besieged Azovstal steel plant in talks with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, its foreign ministry said on Monday. Thousands of Ukrainian civilians and defiant troops are in the encircled plant and multiple attempts at humanitarian corridors have collapsed. Russia said a ceasefire would allow evacuations on Monday, but its success remains to be seen. The UN chief is due to visit Moscow this week, prompting Prime Minister Boris Johnson to warn that the Russian president Vladimir Putin would ""manipulate"" the trip for his benefit. Guterres will meet Putin and then head to Ukraine for talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky. The German government will make a decision on the delivery of 100 old Marder infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine ""soon,"" said a German government spokesman on Monday. German defence company Rheinmetall has requested approval to export the vehicles to Ukraine, a defence source told Reuters on Monday, in what would be the first heavy weapons shipment from Germany to the country. Russia's defence ministry on Monday announced a ceasefire around the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to allow a civilian evacuation from the industrial area that has been sheltering the port city's remaining defenders. Russian troops ""from 14:00 Moscow time (1100 GMT) on April 25, 2022, will unilaterally stop any hostilities, withdraw units to a safe distance and ensure the withdrawal"" of civilians, the defence ministry said in a statement. It follows multiple pleas from the Ukrainian president and the UN over the weekend to cease fighting in the area, where an estimated 1,000 civilians are located along with about 2,000 Ukrainian fighters. The destroyed city's last Ukrainian defenders have already rejected Vladimir Putin's call for them to surrender, instead warning Moscow that peace talks would be called off if any of them were killed. Russia has claimed victory in the city, however the steel plant has remained a stubborn pocket of resistance. The city is crucial to the Kremlin's new aim of occupying the south of the country and establishing a land route to Crimea. Russia has warned the United States against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow's ambassador to Washington told Russian state television. ""We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,"" Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel. Antonov said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia's concerns. He said such arms supplies from the US would further aggravate the situation and raised the stakes of the conflict. It comes hours after Washington's top diplomat met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv, pledging new assistance worth $713 million (£560m) for him and allies fearing Russian aggression. Dramatic videos show the moment large fires erupted early on Monday morning at an oil storage facility in the Russian city of Bryansk, used as a logistics base for Moscow's forces. Russian officials said the blaze broke out at a facility owned by oil pipeline company Transneft at 2am Moscow time (11pm GMT), and there had been no need to evacuate any parts of the city of 400,000 people. Russia's investigative committee said in a separate statement that its head, Alexander Bastrykin, has ordered a probe into the incident. Ukrainian officials have so far made no comment on the fire and its possible cause. Unconfirmed reports on social media suggested a missile strike may have hit the facilities. No injuries have been reported. Footage online appeared to show a second large fire had broken out in the city.

Scroll down in this blog for latest and breaking news. Blinken says US diplomats will return to Ukraine 'this week': the US Secretary of State expressed solidarity with Volodymyr Zelensky and announced the gradual return of US diplomats to Ukraine. Zelensky says the Easter holiday doesn't bring any joy: ""The great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win,"" Mr Zelensky said from Kyiv's ancient St Sophia Cathedral. Ukraine proposes talks with Russia next to Mariupol steel plant: Russian forces launched fresh airstrikes on a Mariupol steel plant where an estimated 1,000 civilians are sheltering along with about 2,000 Ukrainian fighters. UN chief warned that Putin will 'manipulate' Russia visit: Boris Johnson has warned that Vladimir Putin will try to ""manipulate"" a visit by Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary-General, to Moscow. Russia has made 'minor advances': Russia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbas, the UK's Ministry of Defence said on Monday. More on each of these here. Russia struck Ukraine's Kremenchuk oil refinery with long-range missiles and hit military installations in its former Soviet neighbour, the Russian defence ministry reported this morning. The ministry said it hit Ukrainian military installations and the Kremenchuk oil refinery near the Dnipro River, which the governor of the Poltava region had said was destroyed earlier this month. ""High-precision long-range weapons destroyed fuel production facilities at an oil refinery on the northern outskirts of the city of Kremenchuk, as well as petroleum products storage facilities which fuelled military equipment for Ukrainian troops,"" the ministry said, though this has not been independently verified. It comes as a Russian oil depot in Bryansk, near the Ukraine border and used as a logistical hub for troops, was ablaze overnight. The cause has not yet been determined. Russian soldiers wrote “Christ is risen” on missiles fired into Ukraine over the Orthodox Easter weekend as Vladimir Putin spoke about “neighbourly love” at a Moscow cathedral service. At least a dozen people died in the Russian missile attacks exactly two months after Russian forces launched their invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin has used the Russian Orthodox Church in its propaganda machine. Over the weekend, Russian forces described missiles as “Easter eggs” being sent to Ukraine. ""The tankmen wrote 'Christ is risen' on their missiles,"" a Russian soldier told a chuckling woman in a phone recording released by Ukraine's SBU. ""So we are having some fun in any way we can."" More details on this here The US wants Russia ""weakened"" so it cannot invade again and Ukraine can win the war if it has the right equipment, Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin said Monday on returning from a trip to Kyiv. ""The first step in winning is believing that you can win. And so they believe that we can win,"" Austin told a group of journalists after the visit with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The pair met Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, were the first high-profile US officials to visit Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on February 24. ""We believe that we can win, they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support,"" Austin said. ""We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine."" Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated French President Emmanuel Macron on his re-election and defeat of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, the Kremlin said Monday, as tensions remain over the Ukraine conflict. ""I sincerely wish you success in your state activities, as well as good health and well-being,"" Putin said in a telegram to Macron, according to a statement from the Kremlin. Mr Macron has liaised with Putin several times during the two months of conflict and attempted - unsuccessfully - to mediate between the sides at several points. It was a visit mired in secrecy and only confirmed by the White House after it had taken place, but Washington's top diplomat Antony Blinken and defence secretary Lloyd Austin agreed several measures while meeting Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv at the weekend. US officials said the cabinet secretaries pledged new assistance worth $713 million (£560m) for Mr Zelensky's government and 15 allied, Nato and partner countries in the region that are fearful of further Russian aggression. This includes more than $300 million (£235m) in foreign military financing for Kyiv and $165 million (£130m) in sales of non-US made ammunition, compatible with Soviet-era weapons the Ukrainians use. Such financing is different from previous US military assistance for Ukraine. It is not a donation of drawn-down US Defence Department stockpiles, but rather cash that countries can use to purchase supplies. US diplomats will return to Ukraine in the coming weeks, with Washington announcing a new ambassador to the country, Budget Brink, a veteran official. Staff from Kyiv's US Embassy had been relocated to Poland. Ahead of the visit by Blinken and Austin, Ukrainian officials drew up a list of weapons urgently needed from the United States, including anti-missile systems, anti-aircraft systems, armoured vehicles and tanks. It comes as the US and Nato allies have shown growing readiness to supply heavier equipment and more advanced weapons systems. Britain has promised to send military vehicles and is considering supplying British tanks to Poland to free up Warsaw's Russian-designed T-72s for Ukraine. Five railway stations came under fire in western and central Ukraine on Monday, causing an unspecified number of casualties, Ukrainian television quoted state-run Ukrainian Railways as saying. Oleksander Kamyshin, the company's chief, said the attacks took place in the space of an hour and details were being checked. We'll bring you more details on this when we have it. Russia has made ""minor advances"" in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbas, according to the UK's Ministry of Defence. The ministry said in its latest intelligence briefing that Moscow is still ""yet to achieve a significant breakthrough"" and that its decision to besiege rather than attack Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant has ""exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness"". Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 25 April 2022 Find out more about the UK government's response: https://t.co/7NVrOfB161🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/OfcnHgGfR3 — Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) April 25, 2022 United States diplomats will begin a gradual return to Ukraine this week, Washington's secretary of state and defence chief have announced, in a further signal to Russia that its war is failing. The trip by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin - which the US confirmed only after the two had left Ukrainian territory - came as the invasion enters its third month, with thousands dead and millions displaced. Washington ordered the withdrawal of its diplomats in the weeks prior to Russia's February invasion of Ukraine. ""Starting this week, members of that team will be able to do day trips instead into Ukraine,"" a US official said. ""Ultimately, (they will) resume presence in Kyiv."" Britain and a host of European capitals are also reopening their embassies in Ukraine's capital in the coming days. Russian air defence systems shot down two Ukrainian drones in Russia's Kursk region which borders Ukraine, regional governor Roman Starovoyt wrote on his Telegram channel on Monday. He said there were no casualties. The report could not be immediately verified. After a secrecy-shrouded visit to Kyiv, US Secretary of State Blinken said Russia is failing in its war aims and ""Ukraine is succeeding."" The trip by Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin was the highest-level American visit to the capital since Russia invaded in late February, though Washington refused to confirm any travel plans. They told Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and his advisers that the US would provide more than $300 million in foreign military financing and had approved a $165 million sale of ammunition. ""We had an opportunity to demonstrate directly our strong ongoing support for the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people. This was, in our judgment, an important moment to be there to have face-to-face conversations in detail,"" Mr Blinken told reporters Monday near the Polish-Ukrainian border. Mr Austin said Zelensky's response to the aid was deep appreciation for what was being given but ""he has the mindset that they want to win and we have the mindset that we want to help them win.""",World/The Telegraph,"Russia-Ukraine latest news: World War Three now a 'real' danger, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov warns",https://news.yahoo.com/russia-ukraine-latest-news-large-221814510.html
4/26/2022,"Ketamine, a drug once popular in the club scene, is now psychiatrists' secret weapon against depression. Perhaps you've heard of it, either from celebrities' personal stories — such as former NBA player Lamar Odom or Sharon Osbourne— or through the many research studies currently underway to assess its effectiveness. What you may not know is how the drug works to relieve depression, and why it seems to help patients for whom all other treatments have failed. In that, you wouldn't be alone. Dr. Steven Levine, a board-certified psychiatrist who developed the protocol for the clinical use of ketamine in 2011, says scientists are still nailing it down. The Food & Drug Administration, which approved a nasal spray version of ketamine known as esketamine in 2019, is too. As the science world continues to explore how a drug that was once used as an anesthetic on the battlefield has revolutionized the mental health world, here's what you need to know. Ketamine offers ""a more optimistic model of depression"" Levine says the basic way to explain it is that the drug more or less wakes up the brain and allows it to form new connections. ""We think that it affects the glutamate system. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter, [which] are chemical messengers that carry information signals in the brain,"" he says. ""It enables the brain to heal and change and learn and become more resilient."" He believes it's a ""more optimistic model of depression"" than the one behind drugs like Prozac, which is part of a class of medications known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The theory behind SSRIs is that depression is caused by a deficit of serotonin, a feel-good chemical, in one part of the brain. Ketamine rests on the idea that depression affects many areas of the brain, inhibiting its ""neuroplasticity"" — or, ""the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life."" Rebecca Price, associate professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Pittsburgh, who researches ketamine, says its ability to affect neuroplasticity may be why patients who benefit from the drug typically feel relief immediately. ""Ketamine has quite distinct mechanisms from SSRIs in terms of the brain receptors it acts on,"" says Price. ""The dominant hypothesis for why ketamine works so quickly, even in treatment-resistant patients, is that it rapidly — within about one day — restores neuroplasticity in key brain circuitry involved in regulating mood, cognition and affect."" The mechanism behind ketamine bears some similarities to the main chemical in cough medicine  Levine, who has pioneered much of the work with ketamine and depression, says his interest began a decade ago when he was tapped to give a second opinion for a patient with severe depression. The woman, who had struggled to find relief from other treatments, revealed she'd been using something unusual to treat her depression: cold medicine. ""It was a serendipitous, funny thing. She pretty guiltily admitted to me that the one thing on earth that ever seemed to help, despite the fact that she'd had really good care and a great psychiatrist, was when she had a cough and would take over-the-counter cold medicine,"" Levine explains. ""So she found herself — when she was at her worst — taking a little half cap of it to help her feel better."" Levine became determined to find out the mechanism behind this was and quickly narrowed in on dextromethorphan, the active ingredient in cold medicine. ""I was curious ... what is it about dextromethorphan's mechanism that works and then [found] that other medicines shared that mechanism,"" says Levine. ""It brought me back to some of the papers that were starting to be generated around that time, looking at the repurposing of this really old anesthetic called ketamine for this new purpose."" Soon after trying out the hallucinogen on a patient, he saw almost immediate results — and for over a decade, treating more than 6,000 patients has seen them again and again. ""I really feel very grateful that I've had the opportunity to sit with so many people who have shared with me how dramatically changed and improved their life is after [ketamine] treatment,"" says Levine. ""It's just, it's difficult to put into words."" The treatment can ""dramatically change"" lives but works for only 50 percent of patients Levine stresses that while the drug can work wonders, it is by no means a silver bullet. Many people experience a major lift from the drug, but just as many — for reasons that are unclear — do not. ""Only about 50 percent will respond to ketamine treatments, maybe 60 to 70 percent will have that sort of lower bar of clinically meaningful results,"" says Levine. ""So lots of people aren't going to get this great benefit from ketamine. But I have seen people who really were at the end of their rope, who tried everything under the sun ... people who really believe that there was nothing on earth that could help them. I've seen some really amazing dramatic responses. I've been lucky to get lots of hugs."" The drug is helping to push the psychiatry world forward Price, who is pioneering new research that pairs ketamine treatment with neurocognitive training, confirms that ketamine represents a major breakthrough in the world of mental health treatment. ""It was highly significant for us to learn that depression can indeed be reversed this rapidly and profoundly, even in patients who haven’t responded well to existing treatment options,"" says Price. ""I think the field is more open to the idea that we can and should expect better from our treatments for depression and related conditions. Rapid and profound transformations are possible, and we should leave no stone unturned until we can find safe, effective, efficient and durable approaches to help every single person who’s struggling."" Still, Price says the psychiatry world still has a long way to go in embracing new ideas. ""The promise and potential of that initial discovery has yet to be fully realized clinically, because of a range of barriers to widespread adoption by providers and patients,"" she says. ""One of the key ones is the lack of well-established, safe, feasible and effective ways to make these rapid effects more enduring in the long term. Rapid relief might be very important in certain clinical situations — for example, perhaps to address a suicidal crisis — but what people ultimately want, need, and deserve is a way to stay well for the rest of their lives."" Ketamine ""brings you to the parking lot"" Those still confused about the way that ketamine works may benefit from thinking about it in terms of analogies. While some have likened it to a ""flash mob"" in the brain, Levine likes to explain it a different way. ""One analogy I use when comparing traditional antidepressants to ketamine is that it's like deciding to go to the supermarket. With traditional antidepressants, you're starting from home and there are a lot of steps. You have to find your keys, get to your car, open the door, turn on the ignition, drive down the street, make lots of turns, get into the parking lot, get out of your car and then walk in and find the frozen food section,"" he says. ""There are lots of opportunities for things to go wrong and get in your way. With ketamine, it's not that it drops you directly into the frozen food section, but it brings you at least to the parking lot. So it's a much shorter route, and it's perhaps the reason more people are able to benefit and in a shorter period of time.""

4/26/2022,"Donald Trump’s one-time personal attorney Michael Cohen had a fit Sunday after his former boss yet again boasted that he aced an intelligence test in the White House that was actually an assessment to check for cognitive impairment. And that was just one of the “stupid, stupid” things Trump said at a political rally in Ohio on Saturday, a revved up Cohen complained in a video by the Meidas Touch PAC. Trump told the crowd he took the 2018 test to prove he was more intelligent than “radical left maniacs.” As has been explained repeatedly in the media, it was actually a Montreal Cognitive Assessment, designed to detect things like early signs of dementia — not intelligence. The questions are simple, and ask if the test subject can, for example, identify a camel, and remember five words — in Trump’s case, “person, woman, man, camera, TV” — which he has demonstrated he could do on TV. Cohen mocked Trump’s five words and how spectacularly unimpressive reciting them are. “The only people who are amazed are you, you and you,” he snapped. Yet “nobody really actually called you on it.” If Trump has such an impressive IQ, Cohen wondered, why did he have to write letters to all of Trump’s schools warning them not to release his grades or test scores? Cohen also asked why people still go to Trump rallies. “Is it to watch a shit show? To watch the clown carnival barker?” he asked. Cohen ended with a plea for everyone to vote. “I know the man better than all, and rest assured, this man does not belong in the White House,” he said.

4/26/2022,"Members of a San Diego, California, community are outraged after a 16-year-old white male pleaded not guilty to charges connected to an altercation that left a Black girl with multiple stab wounds in her back. Authorities are considering the act a hate crime, as moments before the assault, the boy and other teens allegedly hurled racial slurs at the African-American teen. On Thursday, April 21, the suspect, whose name is being withheld because he is a minor, told the courts he did not stab the young lady — who also is 16 years old — in the back on Saturday, April 16, in front of a group of her family members at the Woodglen Apartments on the 12000 block of Mapleview Street in Lakeside, CA, not far from state Route 67. The San Diego County Sheriff’s Department said the incident happened around 11 p.m. and stemmed from an earlier altercation between different but related parties. The white teen gathered with others to approach the Black teen and her relatives, Lt. Shawn Wray said, which led to a fight. During the melee, the girl was stabbed twice, and the young man ran off with his associates. She was taken to the hospital to have her injuries treated. On Monday, April 18, the boy turned himself in. His girlfriend was also arrested; however, she was released even though she allegedly waved a weapon before the fight began. The teen’s defense lawyer requested he be released to his family on home supervision and GPS monitoring, but the request was denied by Superior Court Judge Richard Monroy. Because of the flagrant use of racial epithets, a special hate crime count, packaged with an allegation of personal use of a deadly weapon and an allegation of personal infliction of great bodily injuries, will be attached to the charges of attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon. If he is found guilty, he could receive up to 17 years in prison. According to The San Diego Union-Tribune, at the hearing in a San Diego Juvenile Court on Thursday, the boy’s parents, grandmother and other family members where there to support him. The girl, whose injuries have not been disclosed, was also in attendance with her mother, aunts and grandparents. Wray, who leads the department’s Lakeside substation, said “it is the first hate crime that is being investigated in Lakeside in 2022.” District Attorney Summer Stephan, who was elected to prosecute crimes across San Diego County, is looking to see what other charges can be leveraged against “other individuals involved” in the attack. During a town hall meeting at the Lakeside Community Center on Tuesday, April 19, more than 100 activists and members of the community challenged the sheriff’s office to be vigilant in bringing justice to the high school student, NBC San Diego reported. As Wray opened the floor for questions, “This was almost a murder!” was proclaimed from the audience. Judy Jensven, a Lakeside resident, said, “Let’s go after this punk’s parents. They learn this hate somewhere.” Detectives said they are investigating to see if the boy’s father was in the crowd yelling derogatory slurs and is culpable for the crime. “You’re setting a dangerous [expletive] precedent if you don’t arrest the father,” one person stated. Another person co-signed saying, “While you investigate, he should be in jail.” Lisa Weinreb, chief deputy of the juvenile branch of the District Attorney’s Office, who was present at the community talk, addressed arresting the father, “While it is horrific, horrific behavior, I can’t prosecute a parent for standing by.” “We are dictated by the law and the law doesn’t allow somebody, and it specifically says if they were standing as a bystander and did nothing more, then it’s not a crime.” The DA added, “Multiple aspects of this incident are appalling and as our investigation moves forward, we will be sure to hold everyone accountable for whom the evidence shows committed a crime.” Activists believe that the handling of the case is colored by the county’s history of racism. Danielle Wilkerson of the East County BIPOC Coalition said, “It’s a running joke that East County is racist.” “You’ve heard Klantee, you’ve heard White Hills, all the things people put a layer of humor on, but that racism is real and alive, and we had a victim this week,” Wilkerson said. Stephan recognized the validity in Wilkerson’s assertion, saying her office has seen a “disturbing increase in hate crimes, with the highest number being committed against persons who are Black.” She further presented startling facts: her office filed 21 hate crime cases in 2020 and 30 cases in 2022. The two-hour conversation culminated with a promise to address the larger issues of racially-inspired violence in the coming months, KPBS reported. Some people in the audience, like San Diego activist Tasha Willamson, thought the promise was empty. “I feel like this was fluff,” she said after the meeting. “This is a new lieutenant who has no clue what he has stepped into or may have a clue but is not sure of the severity.” A spokesperson for the housing development where the stabbing happened released a statement about the violence that occurred saying, “We have a zero-tolerance policy towards violence of any kind, and we stand firmly against any acts of hate. Our top priority is our community’s safety and well-being, and we are actively assisting the ongoing investigation.” The teen has been ordered to stay away from the victim, her mother and her sister and is due back in court June 6.",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,"‘Let’s Go After This Punk’s Parents’: California Teen Pleads Not Guilty to Attempted Murder, Hate Crime Allegations After Allegedly Stabbing a Black Girl In the Back with His Father Reportedly Present",https://news.yahoo.com/let-punk-parents-california-teen-150000748.html
4/26/2022,"HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) — A report issued Monday urges a California coastal panel to deny a proposal to build a $1.4 billion desalination plant that would draw on the ocean to expand water sources in Southern California. Staff for the California Coastal Commission recommended the panel reject Poseidon Water 's proposal to build the 50 million gallon-a-day facility Huntington Beach. The project is up for discussion before the panel on May 12. “This project raises significant and complex coastal protection policy issues,” staff wrote in the report, “including conformity with policies that require protection of marine life, water quality, environmentally sensitive habitat areas, and policies meant to avoid or minimize hazards associated with sea level rise, floods, tsunamis, and geologic hazards.” The staff also wrote that the proposal raises “significant issues” about potential impacts on environmental justice communities. It also lacks, however, details about who would ultimately buy Poseidon's water and at what cost, the report states. Poseidon Water said it believed the commission staff erred in its recommendation. “No water infrastructure project in the state of California has ever undergone this level of study and scrutiny,” the company said in a statement. “If this recommendation stands, it will effectively be the death knell for desalination in California.” The proposal has been touted by some in California's Orange County as an alternative to a long-running drought and a way to expand water sources as the region grows. But environmental groups have long opposed the plan over concerns marine life will be sucked into the plant and argue that critical infrastructure shouldn't be built in a low-lying coastal areas as the region contends with sea level rise. They also say the water would be too expensive. The proposal comes as California faces prolonged drought, worsened by climate change, with its nearly 40 million residents heeding repeated calls in recent years to conserve water. It also comes amid rising concern about sea level rise, with a federal report recently forecasting that seas lapping against the U.S. shore could be 10 to 12 inches (0.25 to 0.3 meters) higher by 2050. Huntington Beach, which is known as “Surf City USA"" and relies on its waves and scenic shoreline for tourism dollars, approved a proposal more than a decade ago to build the plant near a coastal power facility. The plant would draw on the sea water and convert it so it could be used to replenish the local groundwater system, a key source of drinking water for many of Orange County's 3.2 million residents. But the state coastal panel in 2013 recommended a series of changes to the project to protect marine life. Additional studies were completed and Poseidon updated its proposals for structures used to draw in ocean water. Poseidon Water has been running a similar desalination plant in nearby Carlsbad, in San Diego County, since 2015. Susan Jordan, executive director of the California Coastal Protection Network and member of the Stop Poseidon coalition, praised the recommendation Monday to deny the proposal. In a statement, Jordan said it's time for Poseidon Water “to recognize the deep and irrevocable flaws with this project, cut its losses and publicly recognize this project and this site are not good for Huntington Beach or California – it’s time to shut it down for good.”",U.S./Associated Press,Report urges California panel to deny desalination plant,https://news.yahoo.com/report-urges-california-panel-deny-001254120.html
