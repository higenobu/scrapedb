12/31/2021,"An Asian food court stall in Illinois has gone viral on TikTok after an employee refused to serve two Black sisters because of his alleged encounter with another Black person earlier that day.

What happened: TikTok user @labellamonay shared the incident on Sunday, and the clip has been viewed more than 1.1 million times at the time of this writing.
 In the two-minute video, the TikTok user confronts an Asian server of Fox Valley Mall’s Nori Japan in Aurora, Illinois, after he allegedly refused to serve the woman’s sister, because she is Black. @labellamonay argues that her sister is paying the man for her order, but he still refuses to serve her, because a Black customer did not pay for their meal earlier that day. “‘Cause she’s Black? ‘Cause another Black person took your food and didn’t pay, you’re not going to serve my sister?” the TikTok user asks. “You can’t do that, sir. That’s discrimination. You can’t tell her you’re not going to serve her, ‘cause she’s Black because of what someone else did today.” “You people no pay money,” the man replies. The TikTok user then asks, ""What does that have to do with us? I don’t know what you’re talking about, sir. We’re not affiliated with them."" “I thought I would never have to do something like this,” the woman can be heard saying in the video. “Well, what’s worse, the person that we don’t know not paying you $5 or us suing you for discrimination?” The man then replies, “I don’t know. Same face.” 
The reaction: Many users’ reactions were divided, with some defending the Asian server and others calling him out for discrimination.
 “He’s wrong but I also understand him this man is traumatized and hurt. Understanding should come from both sides,” one TikTok user said. However, @labellamonay called out everyone who was defending the man by posting another video showing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which “prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin.” 
   “I’m half Asian and I’m sick of my people DEFENDING people like him just cuz he’s old and doesn’t speak English much. He’s a grown adult,” a TikTok user wrote. “I do not understand how y’all are looking at obvious discrimination and choose to defend this man,” another user wrote.

12/31/2021,"TOKYO (Reuters) -A 61-year-old man suspected of setting fire to a psychiatry clinic that killed 25 people in the Japanese city of Osaka this month died in hospital on Thursday, public broadcaster NHK said. The man, identified as Morio Tanimoto by NHK and other Japanese media, had been in critical condition due to carbon monoxide inhalation from the fire. Security camera footage from the clinic showed the fire broke out when Tanimoto carried two bags of liquid into building and set the liquid on fire, police have said. Tanimoto was a patient at the clinic, local media have said. Among those who died was the doctor who ran the facility, Kotaro Nishizawa, who has been praised for his support of mental health. The clinic, on the fourth floor of a commercial building in a busy area near a train station, treated patients for depression and panic disorder, with a focus on helping them return to work. The fire was Japan's deadliest since a 2019 arson attack on an animation studio in the city of Kyoto killed 36 people and injured dozens.

12/31/2021,"Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is threatening to “dish all the dirt” on Donald Trump to get back at the ex-president over his endorsement of the COVID-19 vaccine. “Yeah, we all wish Trump would do the right thing,” Jones said on his Wednesday afternoon InfoWars program, before urging his listeners to “move on” from Trump due to his glowing endorsement of the vaccine. “In fact, maybe—you know what—to get Trump’s attention,” he continued, “maybe I should just dish all the dirt—you know what, you know what—I am going to dish it all on Trump next hour.” Jones added: “It’s not to hurt Trump, it’s so people can know how pathetic he is when you think he is playing 4D chess, going to save you and he’s not!” (Jones didn’t return The Daily Beast’s request for comment late Wednesday night.) Alex Jones Claimed He Feared for His Life as Wife Attacked Him The vague threat comes amid Trumpworld’s continuing meltdown over Trump’s backing of the COVID-19 vaccine. Earlier on Wednesday, pro-Trump radio host Wayne Allyn Root called for staging an “intervention” to be staged for the ex-president. Outrage over Trump’s stance on the COVID jabs began last week when the MAGA mogul pushed back on right-wing provocateur Candace Owens’ anti-vaccine talking points. “The vaccines work, but the ones who get very sick and go to the hospital are the ones that don’t take the vaccine. But it’s still their choice. And if you take the vaccine, you’re protected,” Trump told Owens. “Look, the results of the vaccine are very good, and if you do get it, it’s a very minor form. People aren’t dying when they take the vaccine.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Got a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here Get our top stories in your inbox every day. Sign up now!
