3/27/2022,"They come surging towards you, wave upon wave, banners flying, drums rolling, a teeming pageant of men, women and children crowding through the grand marble canyons at the heart of Tate Britain. Soldiers, refugees and fishers, mechanics in overalls and dandies in dinner jackets, a green man crowned with chilli peppers, another dressed as a skeleton in a cardinal’s mitre. Pregnant girls, stooped sages, carnival queens in outsize dresses: none alike, and yet all alike, in this endless tide of humanity. Hew Locke’s The Procession is a tremendous spectacle, stretching away into the distance, and it is his most profound endeavour. The 62-year old Guyanese-British artist has never worked on quite such a scale before, but it feels as if he was always ready. The museum expected 60 figures for its Tate Britain commission, but they just kept on coming, forming in Locke’s mind and studio during lockdown and beyond. Now there are almost 100 and each the size of life and fully as unique in its force of personality. What connects them is the crisscrossing of politics, greed, race and history, Locke’s career-long preoccupations. His sculptures and installations have featured haunted ships and porcelain busts of British monarchs embellished with the sinister emblems of colonial oppression, from Benin bronzes to coins, deep-sea pearls and gilded skulls. Look closely at one of the dandies here and you will find William Blake’s devastating print of a hanged slave appliquéd to the back of his jacket. And to some extent, you know where you are going at Tate Britain. The very first figure is a boy banging an old-fashioned drum, its skin made from a Russian General Oil Corporation bond, printed a century ago but more controversial than ever. The very last work, at the far end of the Duveen Galleries, involves a gauzy pavilion held aloft by benighted figures. The fabric is printed with spectral images of colonial buildings in Guyana, now derelict, and with stocks and shares in which land is sold, and with it people, enslaved on sugar cane plantations. Henry Tate’s museum was, of course, built on sugar. But what is so remarkable about The Procession is its absorbing complexity; nothing is ever explicit. You notice the Russian bond, or the derelict buildings, as you might take in passing signs or conversations overheard on the street: as part of an infinitely various existence. Everything – everyone – is connected. The figures come first and foremost. You come face to face with them, one after another, as you walk in the opposition direction through the galleries. Each is veiled or masked – sometimes extravagantly so, as if it were Halloween or Mardi Gras – yet it is not obvious whether some of these masks might be their true faces (at least one ruse of a carnival mask). And then again, nobody could mistake these figures for actual people, since they are so obviously created out of plaster, cardboard, papier-mache and so on. Some are dressed in existing clothes – school uniforms, army overcoats – others in outlandish costumes stitched out of an international ragbag of batik, tartan, sari silk, promissory notes, old embroideries and modern plastics. Something is being said here about ecology, too. Locke’s mise-en-scène is superb. There are hints of Delacroix’s Liberty Leading the People at the front, figures rising and stumbling, hoisting a banner. A Day of the Dead parade sashays with skeletons, spectres and tiny devils in red velvet suits. Halfway through the galleries is a haunting funeral cortege, in which two slaves bear the death mask of an English general on poles, accompanied by diminutive figures in black crepe crinolines. The familiar shape of Queen’s Victoria’s pale jowls is just visible beneath each lace mourning veil. By the subtlest shift of colour, Locke changes the mood. The figures at the back appear to have come through dust and flood, in their tarnished clothes. The march becomes a protest, becomes a mass migration. Everyone is trying to get somewhere or away from something. There is no defining figure; Locke is too subtle. You may find your own along the way. For me, it was a little boy in pyjamas printed with old school maps in imperial colours; a Rees-Mogg child, garbed in the past. And yet he turns backwards, as if confused. Locke’s figures – perfectly conceived to be viewed in the round – have all the sculptural virtues. Locke has always worked with the public in mind and never the market. With its historical sweep and its deep concerns, his art tends to be shown in museums rather than commercial galleries. At Tate Britain, he has found a space large enough for the scale of this never-ending theatre of humanity, which could have gone on for ever (as of course it does). And it all works brilliantly in reverse. Reach the end and you turn back to follow the crowd, now walking with them, bent on where they are going, hoping they will get there. Perhaps it is into the light flooding through the entrance. But before them rises the imperial architecture of Tate Britain. They will have to pass through its triumphalist arch to get there.

3/27/2022,"At the beginning of Andrew Miller’s ninth novel, a letter arrives. The narrator, a 51-year-old recovering alcoholic named Stephen Rose, is being summoned to Belfast from his home in Somerset by a body known as the Commission. The letter assures Stephen that this is not about bringing anyone to trial, but giving those involved in an incident that took place 30 years ago an opportunity to tell their side of the story. In short, the past is being dragged into the light. We know something terrible happened during Stephen’s service with the British army in Northern Ireland as a young man; the promise of learning the grisly details is what entices us through this sombre examination of shame, guilt and the long aftershocks of trauma. Set in 2011, The Slowworm’s Song takes the form of a lengthy confessional letter that Stephen is writing to his 26-year-old daughter Maggie. While inching up to the tragic event that has blackened his life and led him to ruinous drinking, we hear about Stephen’s past and present. He works at a garden store named Plant World and fitfully studies English literature on an Open University course. He comes from a family of Quakers and is semi-estranged from Maggie and her mother Evie. At the tail-end of an adolescence marked by alienation and aggression, he enlisted for the army; his father, a devout Quaker, was startled, but quickly became supportive of his son’s choice. Stephen recounts his army training, notably his introduction to the SLR: primary weapon of the British infantry soldier, the self-loading rifle was nicknamed the ‘“paddywhacker” and used during the Bloody Sunday massacre of 14 unarmed citizens in Derry (that atrocity, and the subsequent Saville inquiry to establish what exactly took place during “15 minutes of mayhem” in 1972, run throughout The Slowworm’s Song as a parallel to the novel’s fictitious outrage). Stephen’s company is at first stationed in Germany, where the young soldiers are trained to take out tanks as the first line of defence against a Soviet invasion (“the Red Hordes pouring westward – sounds fanciful now, part of Cold War propaganda”. Well…) Then the order comes: they are heading to Belfast. These sections detailing Stephen’s army life, and particularly those covering his tour of duty in Belfast, are excellent: immersive in their detail and atmosphere. During a tense patrol through the city’s Catholic enclaves, a woman on the street exposes Stephen to “a passionate hating I’d never come across before”. After his service is cut short by the incident around which the novel circles, Stephen returns to England and moves into a squat in Bristol with some weed-dealing hippies. There he meets Evie, the future mother of his child. When they live together as a couple she asks him repeatedly what it is, “this thing that would not let me be, that in different ways frightened us both”. Stephen bottles it up and hits the bottle. There follows a “drunk’s tour” of Europe and much self-destruction before he eventually returns to Somerset, goes into therapy and joins a 12-step programme. The novel feels rudderless after the traumatic event is finally recounted, but gets back on track when the Commission renews its efforts to persuade Stephen to attend a special hearing. His expectation that he will be publicly shamed unhinges Stephen and his addiction rears up again. As far as what we might call Troublesome fiction goes, The Slowworm’s Song is the first novel I’ve encountered that assumes such a highly loaded perspective. Andrew Miller – a much-awarded writer stepping out of his comfort zone of omnisciently narrated historical fiction – has sufficient decorum, talent and sensitivity to do justice to his delicate subject matter. Stephen endures excruciating torments and a lifetime of bad nights, but the past remains the past: “It cannot be made less and it cannot be made safe and it cannot be hidden and it cannot be forgotten.” Rob Doyle’s latest book, Autobibliography, is out now  The Slowworm’s Song by Andrew Miller is published by Sceptre (£18.99).

3/27/2022,"Elaine Brown doesn’t waste time on small talk. Her stint as the first and only female leader of the Black Panther Party may be long in the past, but she remains a present-day revolutionary. It’s why, when she logs into Zoom to discuss her memoir, A Taste of Power – first published in the United States in the 1990s, only now reaching the United Kingdom – she doesn’t want to expend precious minutes on niceties or beating around the bush. “The situation for Black people in America is largely the same as it was when the Black Panther Party was formed,” Brown explains, from her home in Oakland, California. “We have the highest incarceration and homeless rate; the lowest education and homeownership levels.” She paraphrases Dr Martin Luther King, turning to look at the portraits of her fellow Panthers hanging from the walls of her apartment: Black people in America have double of what is bad, and half of what is good. The reason Elaine Brown doesn’t waste time is simple: there’s still far too much to be done. Having spent a lifetime fighting for the emancipation of Black people, now 79, she has no intention of slowing down. “I can’t un-know what I know,” she says, of what has kept her motivated, her outlook unflinching. “I can’t stop seeing police killing Black people and our suffering.” She’s also not convinced that others would take her place should she wind down. While younger generations look to the global Black Lives Matter movement as a stride forward in anti-racist action, Brown is, to put it mildly, unimpressed. “I find it all embarrassing,” Brown says. “I’m bored by most people who call themselves ‘activists’. So you had a little parade, and you’ve started a hashtag in the ether world? You painted a pavement, went home for a vegan meal, and called it a day?” Brown believes these movements are destined to flounder, devoid of analysis, concrete plans or objectives; that today’s young radicals have lost their way. “It’s frustrating,” she says, “but doesn’t distract me.” Brown keeps her eyes on the prize. “When we joined the Black Panther Party, we surrendered our lives to the revolution. Today, people won’t make that sacrifice. That’s why I try to keep the revolutionary spirit of our struggle alive.” Three Black women raised Brown in 1940s Philadelphia: her mother, Dorothy, alongside her grandmother and her aunt. “We lived in a segregated part of the city,” Brown explains, “and we had to go to the inferior Black schools; there were apartments and neighbourhoods that we couldn’t move into.” Not a day went by at home, Brown remembers, when there weren’t complaints about their treatment by somebody white. Dorothy would often proudly tell the same story; Brown still hears her mother’s voice when she recounts it now. “She worked in a factory during the war,” says Brown. One day her supervisor – a young white man – told her to get to work, while a colleague was also resting. “My mother said, ‘I’ll get up when you tell that white girl to do the same.’” Accused of being insubordinate, Dorothy was suspended. “But my mother,” Brown says proudly, “held her ground. She went up to her supervisor and said: ‘Next time you see a coloured woman you’re going to remember Dorothy…’ And bam! She smacked him in the face just like that.” Back then, every Black American, her family included, was conscious of being treated as a second-class citizen. “I’m not sure there was a formed analysis of the situation, or solutions,” she says, “but they knew they were oppressed, they read Black magazines. The question that hadn’t been answered was: what now?” These disparities became clearer once Brown began attending an experimental elementary school for ‘exceptional’ children, thanks to her mother’s determination. “These families – all white – had money,” she says, “and I knew we didn’t.” The first time she went to a school friend’s place for a playdate, a young Brown saw their refrigerator and carpets; this girl had her own bedroom. “I looked at what they had,” Brown says, “and what we didn’t, and decided I didn’t want to be Black.” In the 1960s, during her early 20s, Brown headed to Los Angeles, hoping to make it as a singer-songwriter. “By the time I got there,” she says, “I didn’t think of myself as Black at all. People told me all the time, especially white people, that I wasn’t.” Her maternal grandmother had lighter skin. “ I loved that shit, and lapped it up.” The problem was, Brown had no plan, or money, to make a start in the music business. “I did a lot of rough stuff, turning a few tricks,” Brown says of those early days, “before I met a rich white man, Jay Richard Kennedy, who brought me into his universe.” Kennedy, an author, screenwriter, composer – and close associate of Frank Sinatra – was married, and more than 30 years Brown’s senior, when their affair began. On Kennedy’s dollar, Brown moved into an apartment in LA’s upmarket Westwood neighbourhood. “I was this kept girl with no ambitions,” Brown says, bluntly, “always waiting for him to come see me… and to divorce his wife.” The year was 1965: a pivotal period in Black American history. That August saw the signing into law of the Voting Rights Act outlawing discriminatory voting practices common in southern states. In the same month, the Watts riots started, an infamous uprising against racist police brutality, in another corner of Los Angeles. “Jay would always talk about these things to me,” Brown remembers, “but I wasn’t interested. It didn’t affect me at all, at least that’s what I thought.” One day, Brown found herself standing in her apartment building elevator, when another Black woman stepped in and joined her. Warmly, she asked Brown: “How you doing, sister?” Confused, Brown turned around. “She couldn’t be talking to me,” Brown thought, “I wasn’t a sister. But there were only two of us there.” This woman had heard Brown practising piano. She ran a community project down in Watts; bored, Brown agreed to come and teach music to the kids. “When we arrived at this housing project,” Brown says, “I started to get nervous.” It reminded her of the community she’d grown up in; a place Brown had tried to forget. “I was starting to remember where I was from,” Brown says, “and therefore who I was, which I didn’t like at all.” Stepping inside, Brown was introduced to the girls she’d been tasked with tutoring. The revelation which followed, she is in no doubt, changed the course of her life. “These smiling girls looked at me as if I was going to save them,” Brown says, still moved by the memory, more than half a century later. “But I had nothing to offer them.” There and then, everything clicked into place. “I looked at them and thought, piano lessons, what the hell? That’s not what you need, you need a whole other life: food, accommodation, education.” Brown knew this, she says, because she knew them. She was them. “It was the most transformative moment of my life,” Brown says. “I suddenly remembered everything. It killed me then, and it kills me now.” For Brown, there was no turning back. She called Kennedy, and presented him with an ultimatum: “I told him he had to marry me and we’d move abroad,” she says, “or it was over. There was no way I could see what I’d just seen and stay in LA on our current terms.” Brown knew exactly what she had to do when he declined. “From then,” she says, “I spent a whole year immersing myself in Black community activity.” She continued teaching; joined Black organisations; read any literature she could find. “And,” Brown smiles, “I also had to get a job, now I no longer had a sugar daddy. That was a drag.” In late 1967, she found herself at a poetry reading. “There were lots of big-talking Black militants who said lots but did little,” she says, still unimpressed. Conversation turned to the topic of Huey Newton, who the previous year had co-founded the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense. That October, those assembled learned, he’d been arrested for shooting a police officer – a charge he always denied, and that was, three trials later, ultimately dropped. “There was talk of a Los Angeles chapter forming,” Brown explains, “when 20 young, armed Black men turned up to the meeting and lined the walls wielding guns.” The poetry had escalated fast. A man introduced himself as Bunchy Carter, a founding member of the Party’s new Southern California chapter. Still, she hesitated to commit: it was a scary proposition, what with all the guns. Six months later, in April 1968, Dr Martin Luther King was assassinated in Memphis. Then Bobby Hutton, also known as Lil’ Bobby – the Black Panther Party’s first recruit – was killed in a shootout with Oakland police. “Cities in America were exploding,” Brown says. “Black people were angry: throwing Molotov cocktails, tearing down buildings, rioting in 100 cities.” Brown decided she had no choice but to take her place in the movement, too. “I found the Party’s tiny LA office,” she continues, “and stated I wanted to join them. It’s not a joke, the woman who greeted me said, ‘This is the revolution, sister. Are you sure?’” Brown signed up. Across the country, many others were doing the same. “It was a symbol of a new class of Black people – urban and young – not content with holding hands and singing, ‘We will overcome’.” In the years that followed, Brown gave all she had to the Party. She moved in with a group of comrades where they slept on the floor, wrote articles, and stored guns. There were police raids and shootouts; community initiatives, and too many funerals. “By 1969 it was all-out warfare,” Brown says. “Every month Los Angeles members were getting arrested and killed.” Just days after Fred Hampton – the Panthers’ deputy chairman, whose story is told in the Oscar-winning biopic Judas and the Black Messiah – was assassinated by police in Chicago, the Los Angeles office was raided, too. Through it all, Brown’s unshakable revolutionary spirit prevailed. She became editor of the Party’s paper, joining its central committee. She recorded albums; ran twice, unsuccessfully, for office at Oakland City Council, and travelled the world. She also found time to have a baby. In 1974, when then-leader Huey Newton left the United States for Cuba to escape criminal charges, Brown was informed it was her time to step up. Three years later, upon Newton’s return, the pair had a string of disagreements. “We argued,” says Brown, “but I was destined to lose, so I left the Party just like that.” Today, Brown remains endlessly busy. There’s her non-profit Oakland & the World Enterprises and its $72m development project: six years in the making, it’ll see a 79-unit all-affordable apartment complex constructed in Oakland. Commercial spaces will be filled with businesses she also works with: launched and sustained to employ the formerly incarcerated and socio-economically deprived. For the past 25 years, she’s been advocating for the release of a young Black man, Michael Lewis, from a Georgia prison. Lewis was 13 when he was sentenced to life in prison for a crime he maintains he didn’t commit. “And,” Brown adds, “I have a film in the works based on my book. We have commitment from Alicia Keys who wants to play me, but we’re just working on a new director to join.” Being a revolutionary, Brown reckons, requires a certain ruthlessness: that’s what saw her quickly exit her Party after 10 years of dedicated service; it’s why she holds no punches when expressing opinions now. America’s Black politicians, she believes, have sold out in their own self-interest; chanting: “Hands up, don’t shoot”? No thanks. “People filmed the murder of George Floyd and think that’s something,” says Brown, angered. “The video was eight or nine minutes long, a crowd had their phones out. Why did nobody throw something at the cops during that time to get them off?” This approach was bread and butter for the Panthers. Today, Brown argues, resistance like it could again save lives. But, I ask, surely those who take such steps might also find themselves in the firing line. “Of course,” she replies, it’s clearly not rhetoric. “All my folks are dead. I’ve seen bloodshed. If you’re not willing to die for what you believe in,” Brown asks, “what are you about?” It’s not that she’s necessarily against marches, clicktivism, or buying a T-shirt. She just believes it’s delusional to then call yourself an activist; to think it’s enough. “I remember watching cars with placards out their roofs drive past me during a Black Lives Matter rally,” says Brown, exasperated. “They drove right past an encampment full of homeless Black people, and never looked back.” Short of taking up arms, what would be her advice? “If you’re not prepared to give your life,” she says, “negotiate how far you’ll actually go. Think clearly about the problem and solution.” The Panthers ran breakfast clubs; free clinics; legal aid programmes. They provided what was needed; offering a glimpse of what could exist as and when revolution came. “Look at what actually serves the interests of Black people,” Brown says, throwing down the gauntlet, “rather than just trying to make yourself feel better. We are poor, and don’t have the things we need to live: food, clothing, housing, education, healthcare.” It was the case, she says, for those young girls she taught piano, and the reason that memory remains so affecting is because the same is true now. “Try working on all that,” Brown says, eyes on the clock, our allotted time together over. “It will keep you occupied for the rest of your lifetime, and it’s a surefire way of showing you truly believe Black lives really do matter.” A Taste of Power by Elaine Brown, published by Penguin Modern Classics, is out now (£10.99).

3/27/2022,"Afro-funk band Ibibio Sound Machine have been around since 2013. The London group are best known for blending disco, post-punk, west African funk and electronic music into euphoric, high-energy soundscapes that feel borderless. Their latest album, Electricity, is produced by synthpop stalwarts Hot Chip and offers their most kaleidoscopic project to date. It’s got the same vibrancy, heart-thumping beats and empowered Ibibio and English vocals, but the songs reach new heights both lyrically and instrumentally.The album opens with the punchy Protection From Evil in which frontwoman Eno Williams sings with a fiery delivery atop a razor-sharp synth line and angsty beat. The Afro-disco title track is rich, with a deep and heavy bassline. Its lyrics might be simple – “Without love, there’s no electricity” – but they stick. While the album is full of jumpy electro grooves, the jazzy horns and west African drums rippling throughout Oyoyo make it the most danceable track.

3/27/2022,"She was everything expected of a fabulously wealthy woman of the 19th century: musical, well read, a polyglot, an accomplished horse rider. But she was also everything unexpected: independent, commanding, fearless, unmarried. Alice de Rothschild, a member of the powerful European banking dynasty, was an avid art collector and creator of spectacular gardens at her residences in England and France. Yet her legacy has been overshadowed by the men of her family. Now, to mark the centenary of her death, she is the focus of new exhibitions at Waddesdon Manor, the extraordinary country retreat in the style of a French Renaissance chateau that was built in Buckinghamshire by her brother Ferdinand and inherited by Alice after his death. “She was an extraordinary woman who stands out in an age dominated by men, intelligent, exacting, discerning and independent, and whose spirit lives on in a place which may have been created by her brother but which she made very much her own,” said Pippa Shirley, the director of collections and gardens at Waddesdon. Alice’s Wonderlands examines the stamp she put on the house and grounds, reflecting her tastes and attention to detail, during her 24 years of ownership. Works of art have been brought out of storage, and rare early colour photographs have been used to recreate Alice’s personal sitting room where she displayed her favourite objects, including Sèvres porcelain vases and a 17th-century Savonnerie carpet. The exhibition’s curators have drawn on 150 art dealers’ receipts, found in 2016, giving details of Alice’s acquisitions between 1904 and 1918. The documents survived Alice’s instructions that her personal papers be destroyed after her death. Porcelain decorated with birds – Alice visited the rococo aviary at Waddesdon twice a day when in residence – and a row of portraits of chubby, overdressed infants are gathered with other artworks in a specially created exhibition room. Another room contains photographs of family and close female friends, correspondence, sketchbooks and estate management records. Alice was a perfectionist, issuing detailed instructions about every aspect of Waddesdon. She specified that porcelain should be cleaned in silence, the method of storing objects when not on display, and which type of fertiliser should be used by her army of gardeners. She had no compunction about telling guests not to touch her treasures, or to forbid smoking in most rooms in the house. Queen Victoria, who visited Alice’s estate in Grasse, in the south of France, is said to have referred to her as “the all-powerful”. Her housekeeping regime, known as “Miss Alice’s rules”, became the basis of National Trust conservation practises. Mia Jackson, the curator of decorative arts at Waddesdon, said Alice was single-minded, fearless and unconfined by social expectations. “She didn’t seem to feel as though she ought to get married, and she did what she wanted to do.” When she took over Waddesdon, “she wanted to honour the memory of her brother, but she should never have been eclipsed by it.” Alice was born in Frankfurt in 1847, and spent some of her childhood in Vienna. After the death of her mother when she was 12, Alice spent several years shuttling between relatives before moving to England at 19. She and Ferdinand lived next door to one another on London’s Piccadilly, and they bought adjacent estates in Buckinghamshire. Alice built Eythrope, next to Waddesdon, as a “day retreat” after being advised by doctors not to sleep near water. Guests at Waddesdon’s lavish weekend parties would visit Eythrope to admire its beautiful gardens. The first world war saw the grand country estate lifestyle in decline; Alice died four years after the war ended. Waddesdon was bequeathed to the National Trust in 1957.

Now in his 70s, Smith has been eking out an existence for 40 years in this location, fly-fishing, cultivating a small plot of land, grubbing up pignuts from the earth and even brewing his own wine from birch sap (he has amassed about 80 gallons of the stuff, which, he says, will ensure that his funeral goes off with a bang). With his bright, bird-like eyes, untamed thicket of beard and boots that peel from his feet like banana skins, he’s a fascinating subject.
