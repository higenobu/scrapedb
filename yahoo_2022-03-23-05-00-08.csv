3/23/2022,"There are some videos on the internet that leave you speechless. This one, filmed in central Texas Monday, is one of those videos. It shows what looks to be a red first-generation Chevy Silverado pickup truck being tossed around by a tornado and dragged across the ground, with at least one person inside. But that's not the crazy part. After the tornado moves on and the truck is thrown back upright... the truck simply drives away like nothing happened. This happened on a four-lane highway in Elgin, Texas, according to Brian Emfinger, a storm chaser who published the video to Twitter and YouTube on Tuesday. The Chevy is caught in the tornado and subjected to the full force of its winds, causing the vehicle to roll onto its driver side. It does a 360-degree spin while sitting perpendicular to the road before being pushed back upright by the tornado's gusts. Despite what must've been the scariest moment of their life occurring, the driver has no trouble continuing down the road. From what we can tell, the truck looked to be relatively unharmed after the event, save for some sizable scratches on the driver's side body panels and a missing side mirror. It's unclear at this time how many occupants were in the truck, or if anyone inside sustained any injuries. Tornados have been ripping through the Austin area since Monday. At least one person has been killed in the storm, and heavy damage has also been done to residences in its path, the Weather Channel reports. Local news station WFAA published aerial photos showing some of the damage tornados have caused in the area so far.

3/23/2022,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Four teenagers face murder charges in connection with a carjacking that left a 73-year-old woman dying on a New Orleans street, her arm severed after she was dragged a block by her own car while neighbors looked on helplessly, officials said Tuesday. Police chief Shaun Ferguson said tips led to the arrests of the teens — a 17-year-old boy, a 16-year-old girl and two 15-year-old girls — in the hours after the Monday afternoon carjacking. Two were turned in by their parents. All face second-degree murder charges, and Ferguson said he will recommend that they be charged as adults “That's a conversation that my team will have with the district attorney's office,"" Ferguson said at a Tuesday morning news conference. ""I would say absolutely, I encourage, I will ask, that they be charged as adults. ... I mean, look at the nature of the crime.” Ferguson confirmed that Linda Frickey died after she become entangled in a seatbelt as carjackers sped away with her vehicle. “The door had closed on the seatbelt, but she was stuck in it,” resident Todd Ecker told WVUE-TV on Monday. “I got out of my vehicle, screaming for them, ‘Please stop, you’re dragging a lady.' Other neighbors were also screaming at them.” A tearful Leanne Mascar and her husband Mark Mascar tried to comfort the victim as she died at the scene. “I was telling this woman to hang in there,” Mark Mascar told the TV station. “Every time I heard a siren, I was hoping and praying that was an ambulance.” On Tuesday morning, Ferguson credited the arrests to police working throughout the night and information from a variety of sources, including two suspects' parents. “The parents of one 15-year-old female immediately called our investigators and turned their daughter in,” Ferguson said, adding that the parents of another suspect followed with more information that led to an arrest. “This was an incredibly difficult decision on behalf of these parents,” Ferguson said. Monday afternoon's gruesome carjacking death came hours after police reported a triple-homicide in another part of the city. Police said three people were found dead in an apartment in the Gentilly neighborhood. The victims, two men and a woman, had all been shot. No suspects have been identified and police were asking for the public's help for information on the shootings. New Orleans' homicide total for the year rose to 61 with the four deaths. The nonprofit watchdog group, the Metropolitan Crime Commission, said that as of Sunday, homicides in the city were up 43% over the year before and 97% compared with 2019.",U.S./Associated Press,Woman's arm severed in deadly carjacking; 4 teens arrested,https://news.yahoo.com/womans-arm-severed-deadly-carjacking-190519723.html

3/23/2022,"By Alexander Tanas CHISINAU (Reuters) - Moldova is monitoring its breakaway pro-Russian region of Transdniestria for any sign of escalating tensions following Russia's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, Foreign Minister Nicu Popescu said on Tuesday. Transdniestria is a narrow strip of land held by pro-Russian separatists that runs along the east of Moldova and comes to within about 25 miles (40 km) of the Ukrainian port of Odesa. Russian troops are stationed there, despite repeated calls by Moldovan President Maia Sandu for them to leave. Ukraine fears Transdniestria could be used as a new front, putting further pressure on Odesa. ""So far the situation is calm. We have not seen any movement towards escalation,"" said Popescu said at the European parliament. ""Given what happened in the region before, we as a government cannot rule out any options and must consider the full range of scenarios for the development of events including negative ones."" Russian peacekeepers appeared in Transdniestria after it fought a brief war with Moldova in 1992 and declared itself an independent state. It remains unrecognised by any country, including Russia. In early February, Russian forces held military drills in Transdniestria against the backdrop of a Russian troop buildup near eastern Ukraine that led to the Feb. 24 invasion. The war has pushed Moldova to speed up a bid to join the European Union and piled huge pressure on its economy by forcing more than 331,000 refugees across the border from Ukraine, of which around 100,000 have remained in the country. On Tuesday, gas importer Moldovagaz warned that the country also faced a potential energy price crunch that could see what it pays for gas from Russia rise to $1,000 per 1,000 cubic meters in April from the current level of $547 due to a sharp rise in gas prices in Europe. But the head of Moldovagaz Vadim Cheban told journalists the company:""will not rush to demand an increase in the gas tariff for consumers"".
