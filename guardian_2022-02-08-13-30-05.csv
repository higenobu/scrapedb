2/8/2022,"Ten million jobs in creative industries worldwide were lost in 2020 as a result of the Covid pandemic, and the increasing digitisation of cultural output means it is harder than ever for artists to make a living, a Unesco report has said. Covid has led to “an unprecedented crisis in the cultural sector”, said Audrey Azoulay, the director-general of Unesco, the UN’s cultural body, in a foreword to the report. “All over the world, museums, cinemas, theatres and concert halls – places of creation and sharing – have closed their doors …  “What was already a precarious situation for many artists has become unsustainable, threatening creative diversity.” Although the cultural and creative sector is one of the fastest growing economic sectors in the world, it is also one of the most vulnerable and is often overlooked by public and private investment, said the 328-page report, Reshaping Policies for Creativity. Government spending on creative industries was declining in the years preceding the pandemic, and Covid led to a collapse in income and employment. Although many national and local governments offered emergency support to creative industries hit by pandemic restrictions, the global gross value added (the measure of a sector’s value) of the creative industries contracted by $750bn in 2020. The report called on governments to bring labour protection of artists and cultural professionals into line with the general workforce, and suggested a minimum wage for cultural workers, and better pension and sick pay for freelancers. “Even in countries with social security schemes designed for freelancers or self-employed people (who constitute a large part of the creative economy workforce), a significant proportion of such workers were often ineligible,” it said. Since the pandemic began, “digitisation took a front seat … as it became more central to creation, production, distribution and access to cultural expressions. As a result, online multinationals consolidated their position, and inequalities in internet access became more significant”. For most artists, the digital environment did not provide enough income to support a professional career. Action was needed to address the “streaming value gap” – the disparity between the value that streaming platforms extract from content and the revenue generated by those who create and invest in creation. Ernesto Ottone, Unesco’s assistant director-general for culture, said: “A basic paradox has emerged, whereby people’s global consumption of, and reliance on, cultural content has increased, however at the same time those who produce arts and culture find it increasingly difficult to work. “We need to rethink how we build a sustainable and inclusive working environment for cultural and artistic professionals who play a vital role for society the world over.” On the upside, many artists and cultural professionals have “seized the opportunity of the rise of niche streaming services to develop innovative projects in the digital sphere”. The report cited Deedo, a pan-African music streaming platform, created in 2017 by Senegalese entrepreneur Awa Girard, that features more than 12m tracks and is accessible in six African countries as well as France and the UK. “Within four years, Deedo has not only become a key player in the African music industry, but has also increased the visibility of African artists, while offering social engagement through its initiative ‘One song, One soul’ (which donates 5% of each subscription to the non-profit organisation of the user’s choice).” The report also said gender equality was “a distant prospect” even though female workers made up 48.1% of the culture and entertainment sectors. “Evidence suggests that women remain under-represented in positions of leadership, have less access to public funding and their work is far less visible and acknowledged than their male counterparts,” it said. The Covid pandemic may also have taken a disproportionate toll on female artists and cultural professionals. Only 33% of awards for the main film categories of 60 major film festivals worldwide were given to female artists and producers in 2019. Less than a quarter (24%) were awarded for best director and best screenplay. The female workforce in the gaming industry is 30% worldwide. “This confirms women’s under-representation in some creative industries (particularly those linked to fast growing technologies) and overrepresentation in other, traditionally more precarious ones.”",Arts/Culture,Unesco warns of crisis in creative sector with 10m jobs lost due to pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/08/unesco-warns-of-crisis-in-creative-sector-with-10m-jobs-lost-due-to-pandemic
2/8/2022,"Nurses and other workers in aged care descended on parliament house on Tuesday morning protesting dangerous staff shortages, underpayment, and a lack of personal protective equipment – issues that persist more than two years after the Covid-19 pandemic began and despite numerous inquiries into the aged care sector. Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation federal secretary Annie Butler addressed protesters and said nurses are “fed up with this government for abandoning aged care workers and residents”.  “Our aged care workers and nurses are holding the system together as best they can but they have got virtually nothing left. This is a crisis that should never have been allowed to happen and we are saying directly, Mr [prime minister Scott] Morrison, you let this happen.” She said the government had allowed a breakdown of privately run nursing homes, having failed to implement recommendations from last year’s aged care royal commission and numerous aged care inquiries that preceded it. “The government’s own royal commission reports – that I can barely lift because of their depth – are all ignored,” Butler told protesters. “It’s always too little too late.” She said nurses asked for support from the Australia Defence Force one month ago. Defence support was only announced by the government on Monday. “In that time, 500-plus people have died,” she said. Aged care workers have shared their stories with Guardian Australia, with staff reporting elderly people yelling out for help and lying in their own faeces and urine, and gardeners and maintenance staff being called upon to do laundry and feeding. An aged care manager in Victoria said she went into her office “and cried” after the federal government delivered latex gloves and hand sanitiser instead of the supplies her home urgently needed. “During our recent outbreak I requested isolation gowns and N95 masks from the national stockpile,” Jane said. “Instead, we received latex gloves and hand sanitiser. I laughed, then I went into my office and cried. It’s like a bad joke.” The manager, who asked to be identified only as Jane, said she has worked 80-hour weeks managing the home since Omicron hit, and has filled shifts in the laundry, kitchen, and in personal care. She said she has struggled to get appropriate PPE or surge workforce staff from the government, and feels that homes are being punished with audits and punitive action rather than receiving much-needed government support. A nursing unit manager working at a home in New South Wales described how she resorted to buying and hoarding PPE because she couldn’t get supply from the federal government. She eventually received thousands of gowns from the national stockpile, but only after Omicron had passed through the facility. “I have 20,000 gowns I don’t know what to do with,” she said. A home-care manager working in Queensland said he had to source and pay for approved rapid antigen tests and PPE from overseas because he couldn’t source any in Australia, though he said the federal government will reimburse the costs. “We had to go and scramble outside of the normal supply chain and source them from China,” he said. A spokesperson for the minister for senior Australians and aged care services, Richard Colbeck, said the spread of Omicron had seen more than 6,000 requests from aged care facilities since January. More than 17m face masks, 6m gowns, 20m gloves, 4m goggles and face shields and 4m million rapid antigen tests had since been deployed, he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “To manage this volume of activity, some orders were split into two or more deliveries to ensure product is delivered as soon as possible and the remainder of the order is delivered when available,” he said. Jane said the home she manages has also struggled to get clinical waste collected. “We asked weeks ago for extra bins, but they still have not been delivered.” Jane said she felt staff were not being recognised for the care they managed to provide despite woeful staff shortages, and that it was impossible to put contingency plans in place. “We ask for agency staff on a daily basis, but there are very, very few available,” she said. “We are doing everything possible to make sure we have enough appropriately trained staff. There simply aren’t any more out there. “It’s not the physical exhaustion that will get me. It is the punitive approach of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. It’s the relentless paperwork I fill in for staff and PPE I don’t get. I honestly don’t know if I can do this for much longer. I don’t even know if I want to stay in nursing.” A commission spokesperson said homes whose workforces had been “temporarily reduced through Covid-19 infection are expected to activate their contingency plans and do everything possible to minimise the impact on their consumers”. “The commission will act promptly where older Australians are at risk of harm and will continue to be present in aged care services to perform its functions,” the spokesperson said. Susan Walton, an aged care nurse who has worked in the same residential aged care facility for 18 years, said at Tuesday’s protest that she works night shift on the floor by herself looking after 40 residents. “Our residents are getting sub-standard care, you can not physically look after 40 people by yourself,” she said. “Mr Morrison, do I go to Mr Smith who is in pain, or Mrs Jones who is on the floor, or John who has got behaviour problems and is intruding into other peoples rooms? I have floor alarms going and buzzers going. What would you like me to do? “Somebody. Speak up for the elderly.” Do you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com",News/Australia news,‘You let this happen’: nurses accuse government of abandoning aged care workers and residents,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/08/you-let-this-happen-nurses-accuse-government-of-abandoning-aged-care-workers-and-residents
2/8/2022,"The Indian coal mining tycoon Gautam Adani has become Asia’s richest person thanks to a push into green energy that has boosted his fortune to $88.5bn. Adani has overtaken fellow countryman Mukesh Ambani to enter the top 10 of the world’s richest people, according to figures from Forbes and Bloomberg, after seeing his personal fortune rise by $12bn in the past year.  Among the mega-rich whom Adani has leapfrogged to reach the world top 10 are Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who slipped down the table several places last week after losing $30bn of his personal fortune. Although Adani has become the face of big coal around the world with its pursuit of the hugely controversial Carmichael mine project in Australia, the mogul’s ascent into the top echelons of world billionaires is down to his expansion of green investments. His Adani Group controls the port of Mundra, India’s largest, in the mogul’s home state of Gujarat and he also owns 74% of Mumbai international airport. But his push into green energy has paid off handsomely in the past year with the listed company Adani Green Energy now his most valuable after its share price almost doubled in the past 12 months. The group is in the process of ploughing $70bn into green energy projects by 2030 with the aim of becoming the world’s largest renewable-energy producer. Adani found his ambitions dovetailed with those of Indian prime minister and fellow Gujarati, Narendra Modi, who leveraged India’s huge uptake in solar power to map out more ambitious goals for cutting carbon emissions at the Glasgow climate conference in November. India plans to reach a target of 500 gigawatts of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030 and that 50% of electricity capacity would come from renewables by the same point. It plans to be net-zero by 2070. Overseas investors in Adani and India’s solar revolution include the French oil company Total, which last year bought 20% of Adani Green Energy. “The Adani Group has spotted and entered all the happening sectors at the right time, which has appealed to a select band of foreign portfolio investors,” Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at Mumbai-based brokerage HDFC Securities Ltd, told Bloomberg. “The sectors are capital-intensive and the company has faced little difficulty in raising funds to expand.” Despite the greener outlook for Adani, the group is still pressing ahead with the giant Queensland mine in the face of fierce resistance from a rainbow coalition of anti-fossil fuel activists, biodiversity conservationists and Indigenous groups. The bitter battle over the mine has seen a succession of on-site protests, legal battles, and the use of a private investigator by the company to secretly photograph the family of activists.",News/Business,Indian coal magnate Gautam Adani becomes Asia’s richest person after solar energy drive,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/08/indian-coal-magnate-gautam-adani-becomes-asias-richest-person-after-solar-energy-drive
