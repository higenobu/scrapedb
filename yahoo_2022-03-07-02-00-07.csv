3/7/2022,"Roger Stone fumed at Jared Kushner for not helping him secure a list of pardons from outgoing President Trump. Stone said Trump's son-in-law should be ""punished in the most brutal possible way."" The Washington Post report was based on hours of documentary footage of Stone filmed by Danish filmmakers. Longtime GOP strategist Roger Stone made threatening comments about Donald Trump's son-in-law and aide Jared Kushner in previously unheard recordings, The Washington Post reported. The Washington Post reviewed 20 hours of footage from Danish filmmakers who recorded Stone over the course of two years for an upcoming documentary titled ""A Storm Foretold."" In the recordings, Stone raged against Kushner for failing to help secure pardons for himself and other allies from outgoing President Trump. Stone said Kushner needed to be ""punished in the most brutal possible way"" and would be ""brain dead when I get finished with him,"" The Post reported. The Danish filmmakers followed Stone as he lobbied for Trump to issue a blanket pardon to protect himself and other allies. Stone had also created a ""pardon wish list"" of various other felons, and in October 2020 told one prisoner's representative that Jared Kushner would help him secure them. They included Michael Sessa and Victor Orena, according to the Washington Post, reported to be the former acting boss and a captain of the Colombo crime family in New York. They are serving life sentences for murder and racketeering convictions in the 1990s. ""I've got to know that Jared's got the paperwork and he 'gets it,' "" Stone said, according to The Washington Post. However, when his plan failed to come to fruition, an angry Stone railed against Kushner and the outgoing president Trump. The day of Joe Biden's inauguration, Stone was wearing a microphone but out of view as he complained to staffer Enrique Alejandro about Kushner, The Post said. ""In two weeks he's moving to Miami,"" Stone told Alejandro, referring to a $32 million lot in Miami purchased by Kushner and his wife Ivanka Trump. ""He's going to get a beating. He needs to have a beating. And needs to be told, 'This time we're just beating you. Next time we're killing you,'"" Stone reportedly said to Alejandro. Alejandra urged Stone to say he was joking, aware that filmmakers were nearby, but Stone refused. ""No, no, it isn't joking. Not joking. It's not a joke,"" Stone reportedly replied. Stone continued on his tirade against Kushner later in the day while speaking on the phone to a friend in front of the filmmakers. During the call, Stone said Kushner needed to be ""punished in the most brutal possible way"" and would be ""brain dead when I get finished with him,"" The Post reported. Stone also lashed out against his old friend and ally Donald Trump, who he said had ""betrayed"" his friends, and said that his presidency was ""greatest single mistake in American history,"" the paper said. In an email to The Washington Post, Stone accused the paper of employing ""a clever blend of 'guilt by association,' insinuations, half truths, anonymous claims, falsehoods and out of context trick questions,"" but did not provide specific examples. Insider reached out to Roger Stone for comment but had not heard back at the time of publishing.

3/7/2022,"The Queen is to make a permanent move to Windsor Castle after not staying at Buckingham Palace for two years. The 95-year-old monarch has been ""working from home"" at the Berkshire castle since the pandemic began. She is now set to stay there permanently as renovations at Buckingham Palace continue for another five years, the Sunday Times reported. The move came as the Queen recovers from Covid-19 and another undisclosed health issue that saw her spend a night in hospital in October and then several weeks resting on doctors' advice. At an official engagement in February, she was pictured leaning on a walking stick and told visitors: ""As you can see, I can't move."" Buckingham Palace will remain the central headquarters of the monarchy, though the Queen is now expected to carry out her engagements both virtually and in person from Windsor, the Telegraph understands, as well as going to events outside the castle. In London, she is expected to attend the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on March 14 and a service of thanksgiving for Prince Philip at the abbey on March 29. She is also expected to take on a visible role at June's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. The Queen and Royal family are expected to appear on the balcony on June 2 for her official birthday parade. The festivities - for which the UK has been given a four-day bank holiday weekend - will also include Trooping the Colour and a music festival, the Platinum Party at the Palace, on Saturday, June 4. The move marks the end of an era, as the Queen's royal standard - a signal to the world that she is at home in Buckingham Palace - will now rarely be seen. In her absence, the Union flag flies above the building instead. Her annual calendar usually includes seasonal moves around the UK, but in recent years these have been disrupted by the pandemic. She is expected to resume them this year, spending the summer at Balmoral in Aberdeenshire, Scotland and going to Sandringham in Norfolk from December until mid-February. The plan to move away from London forms part of a long-standing shift, with Windsor Castle and Balmoral always expected to become more important as the monarch entered her 10th decade. While Buckingham Palace contains royal apartments, it is also a government building and may offer less home comforts than the Queen's other residences. This is particularly the case as it undergoes a long-awaited £369 million overhaul of its electrics and plumbing, last replaced in the 1950s. The revamp began in April 2017. Analysis of the Queen's diary in 2015 by The Telegraph showed that she had already dramatically reduced the amount of time she spent at Buckingham Palace. Staff also concentrated her work into fewer days to help conserve her energy. The monarch spent 109 nights there in 2011, dropping to 88 nights in 2015. Nights at Windsor Castle rose from 119 to 159 in the same period. A Royal source said at the time: “There are a lot of events planned to celebrate the Queen’s 90th birthday in 2016 so it will be a big year, but after that we will see a slight gear change to make things more manageable with a bigger role for other members of the Royal family.” The Balmoral estate in Scotland - long known to be a favourite residence - was also expected to become more important, as it offers her more privacy, peace and space for relaxation than her other homes.",World/The Telegraph,The Queen leaves Buckingham Palace for good as she moves permanently to Windsor Castle,https://news.yahoo.com/queen-leaves-buckingham-palace-good-152003540.html
3/7/2022,"RIYADH (Reuters) - As the tragic reality of war unfolds in eastern Europe, visitors to a defence show in Saudi Arabia were met with the surreal sight of seeing the latest Ukrainian and Russian military hardware competing for attention in pristine exhibition halls. For Maxim Potimkov of Ukraine's state arms exporter and importer, standing alone amid his country's armoured vehicles, sales were the farthest thing from his mind. ""I came for this show because there has to be someone here and we have so much equipment here,"" he told Reuters. ""There was expected to be 50-plus people from Ukraine."" Potimkov, from Kyiv, was travelling to Ukraine from a trade show in the United Arab Emirates when Russia launched its invasion last week, and he had to cancel his plans. Now back in the Middle East, he staffs a booth to promote Ukraine's Kozark 7 and Kozark 2M tactical armoured vehicles and anti-drone systems. Meanwhile, in an adjacent hall, Russian weapons makers were displaying Moscow's hardware, including anti-aircraft weapons and air defence systems. Russian industry representatives, when approached by Reuters, declined to discuss economic sanctions imposed by the West in response to the war. Hundreds of visitors at the defence show in Riyadh, including regional government, military and corporate officials, surveyed this exhibition of might from nations around the world even as residents of the Ukrainian coastal city of Mariupol experienced the dread power of such hardware at first hand. Efforts to evacuate people from Mariupol - which has endured days of Russian shelling that has trapped people without heat, power and water - failed for a second day in a row on Sunday after a ceasefire plan collapsed. Many arms-producing nations vie for influence and contracts from wealthy Gulf Arab countries, especially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have moved to diversify their defence partners and want to develop their own industries.. Saudi Arabia leads a military coalition, which includes the UAE, that has been battling the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen for seven years.
