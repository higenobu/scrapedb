4/30/2022,"During the last two years of the pandemic I felt pretty immersed in the collective experience: I suffered from anxiety, isolation, boredom and a lack of exercise. I was unable to visit relatives, and saw whole chunks of my calendar cancelled. I simultaneously complained about and helped to create shortages of common consumer goods. And I grew anxious all over again as restrictions were eased. But I missed out on one bit of the saga: getting Covid-19. For most of last winter I never went out without coming home and thinking: I bet I’ve caught Covid from that. But I hadn’t. Of course I knew others who had never had the virus. But then, one at a time, they all got it. My friend Pat was furious with himself because he was sure he’d caught it going to a Gail’s Bakery – two years of scrupulous precaution undone by a momentary, entitled craving for sourdough. Spring came and I started finding that my mask wasn’t always in my coat pocket when I went to the shops. I spent time in crowded rooms where people recklessly shook hands. And still nothing. I began to think I was incapable of getting Covid. Then, feeling rough after our holiday, my wife and I both tested positive. From the moment I saw the red line, I felt worse. “Are you going to fix the toilet tank today?” my wife asks when I wake the next morning. “I’ve got Covid,” I say. My eyes itch, and my muscles ache. I could go straight back to sleep. “And the lawn really needs mowing,” she says. “I’ve got Covid,” I say. “Yes, so have I,” she says. She seems set on ruining this experience for me. But I picked up Covid so late in the game that there are no rules left: no testing regime, no requirements for self-isolation, no restrictions on my behaviour to observe. Nowhere can I find any advice suggesting I shouldn’t mow the lawn. The grass has not been cut all winter. The unruly lawn is damp, and the push mower I use slides over the top of it, or becomes clogged halfway along a row. After an hour I have made no discernible progress. My arms are weak; my breath is running short. My wife finds me sitting on the steps, head in hands. “You haven’t got very far,” she says. “I’m going to fix the toilet,” I say. “It’s easier.” I’ve avoided trying to repair the toilet because it’s an old fashioned model with the tank high up on the wall near the ceiling. You need a ladder to get to it, and there’s not a lot of headroom to work in. Once I’ve got the lid off, the problem is obvious: the fulcrum of the lever operated by the flush chain – a little steel rod – has worked loose and is sitting at the bottom of the tank. I roll up a sleeve and, slightly feverish, paw around in the cold water until I find it. Back downstairs I gaze at the half-cut lawn. My wife comes in and looks out of the window. “Still plenty of light left,” she says. “I know,” I say. “Did you fix the toilet?” she says. “Oh yes,” I say. It takes me until nightfall to finish the lawn, in stages. The next day I feel slightly better. A new cupboard for my wife’s office arrives, in flatpack form, but the first I hear about it is when the middle one comes to ask me where the drill is. I tell him. “Are you sure you need it?” I say. He returns with a drill bit in one hand, and the drill in the other. “How do I make one of these go in this?” he says. Later on my wife I and eat lunch together. An electric screwdriver is humming somewhere upstairs. “I noticed you asked him to put your thing together,” I say. “I thought you were busy, and ill,” my wife says. “I have Covid,” I say. “So is he your go-to person for that stuff now, instead of me?” My wife does not answer. “Is there a reason you’re not answering?” I say. She doesn’t answer that either. Much later I come in from my office to find the middle one making coffee. “How did it go with the cupboard?” I say. “Yeah, fine,” he says. “I put in one piece upside down, so you can’t shut the bottom drawer all the way. But I’d have to take it all apart again to fix it, so I just left it.” I think: good man.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Tim Dowling: I’ve got Covid, and my wife seems set on ruining the experience",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/30/tim-dowling-ive-got-covid-and-my-wife-seems-set-on-ruining-the-experience
4/30/2022,"A couple this week told how they face having to cancel their wedding because of continued delays at the Passport Office. Lucia Thompson and her partner, both British nationals who live in Australia, have been told they must allow 13 weeks for their newborn baby’s British passport to arrive. They are due to marry in the UK next month; the ceremony was twice postponed because of Covid. “We applied for our son’s passport in March as soon as the birth certificate was issued,” Thompson told Guardian Money. “The helpline has told us we should have allowed more time, even though we had no control over when our baby was born. The cost of the wedding is about £40,000, not to mention the cost to guests flying in, and our insurance does not cover us for passport issues.” Meanwhile, thousands of families face losing holidays they have booked for this summer because of the delays. Weeks after the Guardian reported problems at the government agency, the backlog has not been tackled, and this week MPs accused it of operating an “absolute shambles”. The Home Office is urging travellers to get their passport applications in “as soon as possible” as the new 10-week processing target is repeatedly being breached. Travellers have been left hundreds of pounds out of pocket because of being unable to fly after their new passports failed to arrive in time. Some had been waiting up to five months from application. Holidaymakers have complained of a system in meltdown, with uncontactable customer services, processing errors and a lack of appointments for the premium-price fast-track service. Others claim that their applications were delayed or even terminated because the Passport Office failed to log supporting documents. According to the Home Office, more than 5 million people have applied for passports after the ending of Covid restrictions. The EU’s introduction of post-Brexit rules that require passports to have at least three months’ validity remaining has added to the pressures, and MPs have accused the Passport Office of failing to prepare adequately for a “foreseeable” increase in demand. Simon Hoare, the Conservative MP for North Dorset, told parliament that the Passport Office helpline is letting down applicants desperate to track their applications. “Constituents going abroad for a family funeral, for a holiday or for business reasons are not getting through to the office, and are lied to by officials when they do,” he said. Service shortfalls by the Passport Office’s contracted courier, TNT, are compounding the delays, with some deliveries taking weeks. A Passport Office spokesperson told Guardian Money it has increased staff numbers by 500 in the past year to cope with demand and processed a record number of applications in March. It said more staff were being recruited by the private contractor that runs its helpline to improve the service, and Royal Mail and DHL had been contracted to help with deliveries. “We have been advising people to allow up to 10 weeks when applying for their British passport as more than 5 million people delayed applying due to the pandemic,” a spokesperson said. “We urge people who need a new passport to apply for one as soon as possible. The vast majority of all passports applications are being dealt with well within 10 weeks.” A TNT spokesperson said: “We took a number of actions to restore service levels across our HM Passport Office network – including operational resources, extra team support and additional customer support resources – and we are currently operating within the service level requirements agreed with the Home Office. We apologise to any customer who has experienced a delay with their passport delivery and we will continue to work with HMPO to resolve individual cases.”",Lifestyle/Money,Thousands face losing summer holidays as Passport Office delays continue,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/30/passport-office-delay-thousands-summer-holidays
4/30/2022,"Fans and followers of Theranos and its founder Elizabeth Holmes can now take home an expensive original piece of the company. On eBay, more than a dozen allegedly authentic products from the now-defunct Silicon Valley firm are being sold – and much like the company itself, are listed at inflated prices. A set of five Theranos branded pens recently sold for $150. A water bottle is currently listed for $1,500. For $11,000, you can purchase an “authentic” Theranos lab coat (notably “never worn”). Many of these products are typical of Silicon Valley firms, which are known to hand out branded pens, shirts and water bottles at conferences. But the demand for those emblazoned with the “Theranos” logo have soared following the company’s spectacular downfall. Holmes was convicted in January on four of 11 charges of fraud following a weeks-long trial chronicling her role in the blood testing firm. The trial attracted massive attention, but months after the verdict was read, the hype has not waned. A Hulu television series has drawn major viewership, a movie is in the works, and the trial of Holmes co-conspirator Sunny Balwani is currently underway. “We are seeing a ton of interest following the Holmes trial, and I don’t think it’s going to go away,” said Aron Solomon, a chief legal analyst for legal marketing firm Esquire Digital who has followed Theranos extensively. The fascination with Holmes has created a micro-industry for new and vintage Theranos merch. And former employees are cashing in. John, a seller behind one account listing Theranos products, worked at the company from 2012 to 2018 and was left with a handful of merchandise. “I heard people were buying stuff online, so I listed some old clothes I had, kind of as a joke,” said John, who asked to be quoted by pseudonym due to privacy concerns. “But they sold for outrageous amounts of money.” John worked in manufacturing and – like many at Theranos – was largely unaware of the issues being experienced with lab testing until it was too late. “We were pretty oblivious to what was going on,” he said. He said he lost his job when the company collapsed. After months of trying to find new employment, he gave up and retired early. He has made more than $1,200 reselling his old Theranos gear, but said it is little consolation. “I had stock options, so it would have been much better for me if the company had not been a lie and had actually produced something,” he said. Solomon, the analyst, said the prices for Theranos gear is owed more to the enduring fascination with Holmes herself than with the former company . “People were infinitely fascinated by her as a character,” he said. “It has become a cultural phenomenon, and that’s never going to change.” Indeed, Holmes’s co-conspirator and former romantic partner Balwani is currently facing a jury in the same courtroom where Holmes stood trial. But the proceedings have garnered a substantially smaller following. “This college dropout wearing a black turtleneck who managed to rip off Henry Kissinger – it’s become a cultural obsession,” Solomon said. “Nobody would ever collect Sunny Balwani merchandise.”",News/Technology,Theranos merchandise on eBay sparks bloodlust among Elizabeth Holmes fans ,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/29/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-ebay-merchandise

HR By the Grace of God, 9pm, BBC Four ​​In a departure from his usual playful psychological dramas, François Ozon’s 2018 film is a fact-based tale about child abuse in the French Catholic church. When devout parent Alexandre (Melvil Poupaud) discovers his attacker, Father Bernard Preynat, is still working with kids and complains to his Lyon diocese, he receives sympathy but little action. Reporting it to the police, Alexandre inspires fellow victims François (Denis Ménochet) and Emmanuel (Swann Arlaud) to expand the campaign as more crimes – and the church’s cover-ups – come to light. Shot dispassionately, this story’s emotional impact comes from the devastating testimonies of the men whose lives were affected.

4/30/2022,"The chef and food writer Trine Hahnemann grew up on øllebrød, a traditional Danish rye bread porridge. Her mother would save old rye bread, dry it out to preserve it, then use it in this breakfast staple by soaking it in beer overnight. “Øllebrød comes from a food culture where all kinds of porridges are made from all the grains available, including leftover bread,” Hahnemann says. “In the UK, you have bread-and-butter pudding, but all our stale bread goes into porridge.” Before freezers, people would dry out excess bread so it would keep for a very long time, and it’s still my favourite way to preserve bread: cut up any stale rye bread into cubes and leave them to dry out in a cloth bag or bowl covered with a tea towel. Once completely dry, store in a jar or sealed container for a year or more. This porridge is just as, if not more satisfying than oat porridge, with the rye bread giving it a sour twang and earthy depth of flavour that’s lifted by the final flourish of fresh lemon juice. Even without any of the optional extra ingredients, this porridge is super-simple and delicious, but by all means primp it up with your usual favourite toppings – I like it with a compote made with surplus fruits or with crushed nuts and seeds, and even grated chocolate.

4/30/2022,"It is calving season. By my estimation, having tracked her cycle from when she ran with the bull last summer, this beast is overdue. That’s not unusual, but she is a heifer – a first-time mother – so I have been monitoring closely. She had behaved normally at feeding, giving no reason to suspect change, but later on as I pass through the woods with the dogs, I see her down. By habit, I inspect. She seems uncomfortable, her breath pulses shallow and quick, though she has been doing this intermittently for days. As I look, there is a sudden expulsion of fluid at my feet. She stands abruptly, just as surprised as me, and sniffs at the ground. Then she makes the tenderest of sounds, instinctively communicating with her unborn calf. There is a primitive power in this moment in which a life is about to be made living, but additionally so in this instance. The mother of this heifer was our original matriarch, a cow we relied on. In 2019, she was condemned with TB along with almost half our small herd. We wondered if the farm could continue after such a big loss, but the orphaned calf – her only surviving progeny – felt reason enough to try. Progress is steady. She alternates between lying and standing. When she goes down, I make sure the calf is presenting correctly – two blanched hooves, pointing down; inside her I feel a nose. But steady becomes slow, she is losing momentum. At the next wave of contractions, I go to help. With both of us straining – she pushing, me pulling – we inch it out until the calf fully emerges, a warm, slithering mass. It is momentarily lifeless, its tongue blueish and swollen. I prop it upright and squeeze my hand over its nostrils to clear the airways. She licks, I rub, we both urge encouragement. Then it blinks and gives a slight shake of its head. It is alive – and what’s more, it’s a heifer. Opinion is mixed on the naming of livestock, but sometimes the case is clearcut. Given her provenance and her future potential, we call this new calf Faith.
