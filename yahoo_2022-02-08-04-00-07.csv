2/8/2022,"(Reuters) - Rumble Inc, a YouTube-style website popular among U.S. conservatives, has offered Joe Rogan $100 million over four years for all his shows, days after the podcaster apologized for using racial slurs in his content. Rogan is also facing backlash for COVID-19 misinformation in his program hosted on Spotify, after singer-songwriters including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell pulled their content from the streaming platform. The incidents prompted Spotify to add a ""content advisory"" to any episode featuring discussion of COVID-19 as scientists and medical professionals urged the platform to prevent Rogan from spreading falsehoods. ""Dear Joe, we stand with you, your guests and your legion of fans in desire for real conversation,"" Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski said in an email to Rogan posted on Rumble's twitter page on Monday. ""How about you bring all your shows to Rumble, both old and new, with no censorship, for 100 million bucks over four years?"" Rogan did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. His show, ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" has become one of the most popular podcasts on Spotify after the streaming platform started featuring it in 2020. The Wall Street Journal had then reported that Spotify's exclusive licensing deal for the show was worth more than $100 million. Shares of CF Acquisition VI, the SPAC that has agreed to take Rumble public, surged more than 18% on the news. The deal, announced in December, had valued Rumble at $2.1 billion. Launched in 2013, Canada-based Rumble has also entered an agreement to deliver video and streaming for Truth Social, former U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed social media app. (Reporting by Eva Mathews in Bengaluru and Helen Coster in New York; Editing by Devika Syamnath)",Business/Reuters,Podcaster Joe Rogan gets $100 million offer from Trump-affiliated site Rumble,https://news.yahoo.com/podcaster-joe-rogan-gets-100-180940651.html

Rita Ora spent her Sunday afternoon getting lots of sun, and showing off her super sculpted and strong bod in a new post to her Instagram Stories. The ""You for Me"" singer recently finished filming The Voice Australia, and has been making the most of her time Down Under catching tons of rays. In the pic, Rita, 31, is rocking a super stringy black bikini while lounging on a cushioned chair and resting her head on a pillow. And her abs are sooo toned. Take a look, and tell me that you don't wish you lived someplace warm right this second: Rita has been consistent in the gym as of late. Last month, she shared some pics of her gym workout, which included a pic of her doing some dumbbell chest presses. And back in December, Rita posted pics from another workout that included time on a stationary bike and chest presses while in a bridge position on a weight bench. Rita works with Australia-based trainer Jono Castano, and he puts her through super intense sweat sessions. He shared more about their workouts with the Daily Mail: ""With Rita, we might focus on HIIT cardio training in the first half of the week, then core and upper body in the middle, and lower body at the end,"" Castano said.   A post shared by JONO CASTANO (@jonocastanoacero) Overall, Rita loves to do circuit training. “I usually work out for one or two hours, depending on how much time I have,” she previously told Shape. “I do three circuits and repeat that three times. I mostly focus on my thighs and my bum, so I do a lot of squats and weight lifting. And I do one circuit of cardio.” Rita also tries to eat a balanced diet, which includes lots of protein and veggies on a normal day. And she also uses portion control. ""I watch what I eat but I just cut my portions in half,"" Rita shared with Cosmopolitan. ""So if I want a burger I'll just cut it in half and eat half of it. That or I'll take the bread off and only eat the burger. Or if I want fries then I won't have a burger to go with them.""

2/8/2022,"Low levels of vitamin D prior to catching COVID-19 were linked to worse illness, a study found. Vitamin D helps bolster the immune system to tackle viruses that attack the lungs, researchers said. Vitamin D is ""one piece of the complex puzzle"" underlying severe COVID-19, the scientists cautioned. Israeli scientists said they found ""striking"" differences in the chances of getting seriously ill from COVID-19 when they compared patients who had sufficient vitamin D levels prior to contracting the disease with those who didn't. A study published on Thursday in the research journal PLOS One found that about half of people who were vitamin D deficient before getting COVID-19 developed severe illness, compared to less than 10% of people who had sufficient levels of the vitamin in their blood. We know vitamin D is vital for bone health, but its role in protecting against severe COVID-19 is less well established. The latest research was the first to examine vitamin D levels in people prior to them contracting COVID-19, the study authors said. Dr. Amiel Dror, a study author and physician at the Galilee Medical Center, said of the findings, ""We found it remarkable, and striking, to see the difference in the chances of becoming a severe patient when you are lacking in vitamin D compared to when you're not,"" The Times of Israel reported. The findings come from 253 people admitted to Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya, Israel, between April 7, 2020, and February 4, 2021 — a period before the highly infectious Omicron variant emerged. Dror said the findings suggested that vitamin D helped bolster the immune system to deal with viruses that attack the respiratory system. ""This is equally relevant for Omicron as it was for previous variants,"" Dror said. The research doesn't prove that vitamin D protects against COVID-19 and isn't a green light to avoid vaccines and take vitamins instead. Vaccines cut the risk of Omicron hospitalization, particularly after a booster, by up to 90%, the UK Health Security Agency said. Most vitamin D comes from direct sunlight on the skin. It's also found in foods such as fatty fish, mushrooms, and egg yolks and in supplements. Vitamin D levels of more than 20 nanograms per milliliter are considered sufficient for most people, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — which is the benchmark used by the researchers from Bar-Ilan University and Galilee Medical Center. Research compiled before the emergence of COVID-19 and published in The Lancet found that vitamin D cut the risk of other respiratory infections, compared with dummy drugs. But for COVID-19, early findings have been inconsistent: Some studies have found a link between low vitamin D levels and severe COVID-19, while others have concluded that the vitamin wasn't protective. It wasn't clear — even from those studies with results showing a positive correlation between low vitamin D levels and severe COVID-19 — if depleted vitamin D came before or after people became sick, the Israeli researchers said. Despite the new data from Israel, we still don't know if low vitamin D levels cause people with COVID-19 to develop serious disease. Underlying conditions that reduce vitamin D can also make people more vulnerable to severe COVID-19, for example. The Israeli researchers cautioned that vitamin D was ""one piece of the complex puzzle"" underlying severe COVID-19, in addition to comorbidities, genetic predisposition, dietary habits, and geographic factors. ""Our study warrants further studies investigating if and when vitamin D supplementation among vitamin D deficient individuals in the community impacts the outcome of an eventual COVID-19 episode,"" they said.

2/8/2022,"By Anton Zverev DONETSK, Ukraine (Reuters) -A Russian-backed separatist leader in eastern Ukraine said on Monday that full-scale war could break out there at any time and his forces might need to turn to Moscow for support. Denis Pushilin, head of the breakaway Donetsk People's Republic, said there was a high likelihood of a war that would bring huge casualties, although it would be ""madness"" to embrace such a conflict. ""First of all we rely on ourselves, but we do not rule out that we will be forced to turn to Russia if Ukraine, with the support of Western countries, passes a certain line,"" he told Reuters in an interview in his fortified office. Some 15,000 people have been killed since 2014 in fighting between the Russian-backed separatists and the Ukrainian army, according to the government in Kyiv. Tensions have risen sharply since November, when Russia started massing a force of more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine's borders, raising fears of a much bigger war despite Moscow's insistence it has no plan to invade. Pushilin said the separatists had gaps in their weaponry when it came to electronic warfare, air defences and the ability to counter the Ukrainian army's Turkish-made drones. He said they were not in contact with Russia about providing weapons, but noted an ""important statement"" by a ruling party politician in the Russian parliament last month who said Moscow should supply certain types of arms to the separatists in Donetsk and neighbouring Luhansk. In a second Reuters interview, an influential commander in the breakaway region, Alexander Khodakovsky, urged Russia to send 30,000 soldiers to reinforce the separatists and operate new weapons systems he hoped Moscow would supply. ""CONSTANT THREAT"" Russia says the Ukraine conflict is a civil war in which it has no involvement, but senior Ukrainian government sources say Russia has deployed a military force of about 2,000 to support an estimated 35,000 separatists in the eastern Donbass region. ""Russian forces have been waging war in Donbass for eight years,"" Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said. Pushilin declined to give a clear answer when asked about the likelihood or desirability of Russia recognising his breakaway territory as an independent state, as some deputies in the Russian parliament are urging President Vladimir Putin to do. He said it would be ""selfish"" to focus only on the separatist regions and ignore the interests of ethnic Russians in other parts of Ukraine. Without providing evidence, he said there was a ""constant threat of military actions"" on the Ukrainian side, and clear signs of active preparations. Ukraine has repeatedly denied Russian accusations that it is planning to take back the breakaway regions by force. ""I'm even talking about some kind of big war. Which I would like to avoid, because this war could be the last one for humanity,"" Pushilin said, accusing the West of exacerbating the situation. He criticised ""naive"" statements by U.S. officials that the timing of any conflict would be influenced by whether the ground was frozen. ""It could all start at any moment, regardless of weather conditions. Sometimes unfavourable weather conditions are good cover for launching an attack.""

2/8/2022,"Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s campaign team attacked a 17-year-old boy on Twitter over the weekend after the teen shared a report suggesting that an educational program about slavery at the Republican governor’s mansion could be eliminated. The “Team Youngkin” Twitter account fired back at high school senior Ethan Lynne on Saturday by posting a photo of the teen standing with former Gov. Ralph Northam (D). It included a racist photo of Northam from his 1984 yearbook, which first made news in 2019. “Here’s a picture of Ethan with a man that had a Blackface/KKK photo in his yearbook,” read the since-deleted Tweet that was preserved by public radio station VPM.

Ethan says he hasn’t heard anything from them. pic.twitter.com/YWMmLCOQys — Ben Paviour (@BPaves) February 6, 2022 The bizarre photo response was an apparent comeback to Ethan ― who identifies in his Twitter profile as a political intern and high school senior ― sharing news of the resignation of the mansion’s historian and archeologist, Kelley Fanto Deetz, as reported by VPM. Deetz, who educated the public about the house’s former slaves, had been hired during the Northam administration and her position since Youngkin took office in January was reportedly unclear. Last month she told VPM that she arrived at the mansion to find that her office had been emptied, that period pieces on loan from historic sites had been moved, and a TV had been placed inside of what was planned as an education space for mansion visitors. Ethan told The Washington Post on Sunday that the posted photo of him was deleted more than 12 hours after it was tweeted and that he did not receive an apology. “A governor’s campaign account has attacked a minor — to me that was a new low,” he told the Post. “I received no apology, no communication, nothing.” Matt Wolking, a consultant at Axiom Strategies which VPM reported has helped run Youngkin’s campaign, said in a statement to VPM that the tweet was removed after learning that it came from a minor. An apology was not issued. A spokesperson for Youngkin did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Youngkin addressed the incident in a tweet Monday, calling the initial post “unauthorized.” On Saturday night, an unauthorized tweet came from a campaign account.

2/8/2022,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran has shut down a news website for publishing a gruesome image of a man holding a large knife in one hand and what was said to be the head of his wife in his hand, the state-run IRAN newspaper reported Monday. According to the report, a media supervisory board on Sunday closed the Rokna website because of its continuing to “publish images and issues that violate public decency.” Authorities have arrested the man and his brother on charges of killing the man's wife on Saturday in the southwestern city of Ahvaz. The photograph and a video of the victim have had tens of thousands of views on social media. The semi-official news agency ILNA quoted Sunday police officer Col. Sohrab Hosseinnejad as saying the two “defendants confessed to the murder during the police investigation and were introduced to the judicial authority.” It cited family problems as the likely motive for the killing, but added that the case is under investigation. Police didn't release the men’s names or elaborate on the killing or who filmed the video. Such violence is rare in Iran. In April 2021, a 50-year-old man shot to death his 9-year-old son and seven of his in-laws in the city of Ahvaz. In 2020, in the northern Gilan province, a father decapitated his daughter because he did not approve of her boyfriend. Rokna was started in 2016 and now has more than 20,000 subscribers on Telegram, a free social instant messaging service that provides video calling, file sharing and other features. Iran has had a long history of closures of media outlets.

2/8/2022,"A Home Depot worker in Arizona was arrested and charged with passing $387,500 in counterfeit money. Officials say the employee admitted to swapping cash from the register with movie prop $100 bills. The criminal complaint says the scheme lasted from August 2018 to January 2022. An entry level vault associate at a Home Depot in Arizona was arrested last week on charges of passing counterfeit money totaling nearly $390,000 over a period of about three and a half years. The US Secret Service, which was originally founded in 1865 to enforce laws against counterfeiting, said in a statement that Adrian Jean Pineda admitted to the crime when confronted by Home Depot supervisors and federal agents. According to the complaint filed in the Arizona District Court, Pineda went on Amazon and bought pretend $100 bills designed for movie props and bearing the serial number ""PLAYMONEY,"" which he substituted for real bills from the store's cash register. As a vault associate for Home Depot — a position with an average hourly wage of $14, per Glassdoor — Pineda was responsible for preparing bundles of cash for deposit at a local Wells Fargo branch. ""He was just in a really good position to do the crime,"" Frank Boudreaux Jr., the special agent in charge with the US Secret Service's office in Phoenix, told The New York Times. ""He bypassed the first layer of counterfeit detection — the cashier,"" Boudreaux added. A Home Depot spokesperson referred Insider to the Secret Service when reached for comment. Security footage documented Pineda on at least 16 occasions taking fake bills from his personal wallet, mixing them into the register funds, and then pocketing the real money, the complaint said. Home Depot alerted the Secret Service in December after it noticed an unusually high number of fake bills coming from the location where Pineda worked. The Secret Service says the store's losses totaled $387,500 from the scheme. On January 31, a Home Depot asset protection manager confronted Pineda about the deception, after which he was interviewed by Secret Service agents who say he admitted to embezzling the funds and handed over seven fake bills and $5,300 in stolen cash that he had on his person at the time. Pineda was hired in November 2017, and told agents he first swapped the fake cash in August 2018 and continued until the day of his arrest, the complaint said. Pineda will appear before a federal judge on Monday for a status hearing.

2/8/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Inside one of the only federal women’s prisons in the United States, inmates say they have been subjected to rampant sexual abuse by correctional officers and even the warden, and were often threatened or punished when they tried to speak up. Prisoners and workers at the federal correctional institution in Dublin, California, even have a name for it: “The rape club.” An Associated Press investigation has found a permissive and toxic culture at the Bay Area lockup, enabling years of sexual misconduct by predatory employees and cover-ups that have largely kept the abuse out of the public eye. The AP obtained internal federal Bureau of Prisons documents, statements and recordings from inmates, interviewed current and former prison employees and inmates and reviewed thousands of pages of court records from criminal and civil cases involving Dublin prison staff. Together, they detail how inmates’ allegations against members of the mostly male staff were ignored or set aside, how prisoners could be sent to solitary confinement for reporting abuse and how officials in charge of preventing and investigating sexual misconduct were themselves accused of abusing inmates or neglecting their concerns. In one instance, a female inmate said a man, who was her prison work supervisor, taunted her by remarking “let the games begin” when he assigned her to work with a maintenance foreman she accused of rape. Another worker claimed he wanted to get inmates pregnant. The warden — the man in charge at Dublin — kept nude photos on his government-issued cellphone of a woman he is accused of assaulting. One inmate said she was “overwhelmed with fear, anxiety, and anger, and cried uncontrollably” after enduring abuse and retaliation at Dublin. Another said she contemplated suicide when her cries for help went unheeded and now suffers from severe anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. __ All sexual activity between a prison worker and an inmate is illegal. Correctional employees enjoy substantial power over inmates, controlling every aspect of their lives from mealtime to lights out, and there is no scenario in which an inmate can give consent. The allegations at Dublin, which so far have resulted in four arrests, are endemic of a larger problem within the beleaguered Bureau of Prisons. In 2020, the same year some of the women at Dublin complained, there were 422 complaints of staff-on-inmate sexual abuse across the system of 122 prisons and 153,000 inmates. The agency said it substantiated only four of those complaints and that 290 are still being investigated. It would not say whether the allegations were concentrated in women’s prisons or spread throughout the system. A hotbed of corruption and misconduct, the federal prison system has been plagued by myriad crises in recent years, including  widespread criminal activity among employees, critically low staffing levels that have hampered responses to emergencies, the rapid spread of COVID-19, a failed response to the pandemic and dozens of escapes. Last month, the embattled director, Michael Carvajal, announced he was resigning. On Monday, two inmates were killed in a gang clash at a federal penitentiary in Texas, prompting a nationwide lockdown. The AP contacted lawyers for every Dublin prison employee charged with sexual abuse or named as a defendant in a lawsuit alleging abuse, and tried reaching the men directly through available phone numbers and email addresses. None responded to interview requests. A government lawyer representing one of the men being sued declined comment. Thahesha Jusino, taking over as Dublin’s warden at the end of the month, promised to “work tirelessly to reaffirm the Bureau of Prisons’ zero tolerance for sexual abuse and sexual harassment.” She said the agency is fully cooperating with the Justice Department’s inspector general on active investigations and noted that a “vast majority” of these cases were referred for investigation by the Bureau of Prisons itself. “I am committed to ensuring the safety of our inmates, staff, and the public,” Jusino said in a statement to the AP. “A culture of misconduct, or actions not representative of the BOP’s Core Values will not be tolerated.” The Justice Department said in a statement that “Zero tolerance means exactly that. The Justice Department is committed to both holding accountable any staff who violate their position of trust and to preventing these crimes from happening in the first place.” __ FCI Dublin, about 21 miles (34 kilometers) east of Oakland, was opened in 1974. It was converted in 2012 to one of six women-only facilities in the federal prison system. Actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman both served time there for their involvement in a college admissions bribery scandal. As of Feb. 1, it had about 750 inmates, many serving sentences for drug crimes. There are increasingly more women behind bars but they are still a minority — only about 6.5% of the overall federal inmate population. Union officials say the vast majority of Dublin employees are honest and hardworking, and are upset that the allegations and actions of some workers have tarnished the prison’s reputation. “We have a diversified staff. We have veterans. We have ex-law enforcement. We have good people, and they’re very traumatized,"" Dublin union president Ed Canales said. Inmates and prison workers who spoke to the AP did not want their names published for fear of retaliation. The AP also does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission. Women made the first internal complaints to staff members about five years ago, court records and internal agency documents show, but it’s not clear whether those complaints ever went anywhere. The women say they were largely ignored, and the abuse continued. One inmate who reported a 2017 sexual assault said she was told nothing would be done about her complaint because it was a “he said-she said.” The woman, who is now suing the Bureau of Prisons over her treatment, said she was fired from her prison commissary job as retaliation. When she went to report her firing, she said a Dublin counselor took her abuser’s side, responding: “Child, do you want him to lose his job?” The woman was moved to a different prison a week later. In 2019, another Dublin inmate sued — first on her own with handwritten papers, then with the backing of a powerful San Francisco law firm — alleging that a maintenance foreman repeatedly raped her and that other workers facilitated the abuse and mocked her for it. When an internal prison investigator finally caught wind of what was happening, the woman said she was the one who got punished with three months in solitary confinement and a transfer to a federal prison in Alabama. Then, in 2020, another inmate’s report that Dublin workers were abusing inmates broke through to the Justice Department’s inspector general and the FBI, triggering a criminal investigation that has led to the arrest of four employees, including former warden Ray J. Garcia, in the past seven months. They each face up to 15 years in prison, though in other recent cases, sentences have ranged from three months to two years. Two of the men are expected to plead guilty in the coming weeks in federal court to charges of sexual abuse of a ward. None of the men accused in civil suits has been charged with crimes. Several Dublin workers are under investigation, though it’s not clear whether the men accused in the civil suits are among them. The FBI said Friday that it is continuing to investigate and is looking for anyone who may have been victimized to come forward and speak with agents. __ The former warden, arrested last September, is accused of molesting an inmate as she tried to push him away. Garcia made her and another inmate strip naked as he did rounds and took pictures that were found on his personal laptop computer and government-issued cell phone when the FBI raided his office and home last summer, prosecutors said. The abuse ended when the pandemic exploded and women were locked in their cells, they said. Garcia was later promoted; the Bureau of Prisons said it didn't know about the abuse until later. “If they’re undressing, I’ve already looked,” Garcia, 54, told the FBI in July 2021, according to court records. “I don’t, like, schedule a time like ‘you be undressed, and I’ll be there.’” Garcia, who was placed on leave after the raid and retired a month after his arrest, is also accused of using his authority to intimidate one of his victims, telling her that he was “close friends” with the person responsible for investigating staff misconduct and boasting that he could not be fired, prosecutors said. Ross Klinger, 36, a Dublin prison recycling technician, is scheduled to plead guilty on Thursday to charges he sexually abused at least two inmates between March and September 2020, including inside a warehouse and in a shipping container on prison grounds while another inmate acted as a lookout. Klinger told the women he wanted to marry them and father their children, even proposing to one of them with a diamond ring after she was discharged to a halfway house, prosecutors said. Another prisoner aware of the abuse reported Klinger to the Bureau of Prisons in June 2020, according to the FBI, but he was still allowed to transfer to a federal jail in San Diego months later. Despite the move, prosecutors said, Klinger kept contacting one of victim through an email address he created with a phony name, sometimes sending lewd messages referencing sexual acts, and messaged the other woman on Snapchat, saying he loved her and was “willing to do anything” for her. Interviewed by investigators in April 2021, Klinger denied any wrongdoing, but said that because of the allegations his life was over and that he was concerned about going to prison and being labeled as a sex offender. He was in handcuffs two months later. “Sexual misconduct of a ward, you can’t come back from that,” Klinger told investigators in the interview, according to court documents. John Russell Bellhouse, 39, a prison safety administrator, is scheduled to be arraigned this month on charges he sexually abused an inmate he called his “girlfriend” from February to December 2020. He was placed on leave in March and arrested in December. James Theodore Highhouse, 49, a prison chaplain, has already signed a plea agreement and is scheduled to plead guilty Feb. 23 to charges he put his penis on an inmate’s genitals, mouth and hand and masturbated in front of her in 2018 and 2019, and that he lied to investigators when questioned about the abuse. He was arrested last month. __ Garcia, the highest-ranking federal prison official arrested in more than 10 years, had an outsize influence as warden over how Dublin handled employee sexual misconduct. He led staff and inmate training on reporting abuse and complying with the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act, known as PREA, and had control over staff discipline, including in cases of sexual abuse. In his prior role as associate warden, he had had disciplinary authority over all inmates, but not staff. He was also in charge of the legally required “rape elimination” compliance audit, first scheduled for early 2020 but not completed until last September — about the time he was arrested. The Bureau of Prisons blamed the pandemic for the delay and said the audit, Dublin’s first since 2017, is not yet finalized and cannot be made public. In private, Garcia was flouting measures put in place to protect inmates from sexual abuse and he later panicked that he would get caught for his own alleged misbehavior, court records show. The woman Garcia is accused of assaulting told investigators that one instance of abuse happened while PREA officials were visiting the prison. Garcia assaulted her in a changing stall designed for PREA-compliant searches, she said. Publicly, Garcia appeared to take a hard line on abuse. In one of his first acts after he was named warden in November 2020, he recommended firing the maintenance foreman William Martinez, accused of rape in the 2019 suit — albeit for what the staff disciplinary process narrowed to a finding of an “appearance of an inappropriate relationship with an inmate.” Martinez has denied the allegations and has filed a discrimination complaint against the Bureau of Prisons with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. He has not been charged with a crime. Garcia tasked another official with making a final decision on punishment and that person reduced the penalty to a 15-day suspension, but even that was later overturned. Internal documents obtained by the AP show that prison officials failed to look into the allegations against Martinez for nearly two years and then, after the investigation finished, waited another year to propose discipline. An administrative judge wrote in June that the prison’s protracted investigation “strains credulity” on a matter as serious as alleged sexual abuse. But the judge also found that prison officials cherry-picked evidence to bolster their case, only to end up unraveling it. He reversed the suspension and ordered the Bureau of Prisons to provide back pay. ___ Sisak reported from New York. ___ On Twitter, follow Michael Balsamo at twitter.com/mikebalsamo1 and Michael Sisak at twitter.com/mikesisak and send confidential tips by visiting https://www.ap.org/tips",U.S./Associated Press,AP investigation: Women's prison fostered culture of abuse,https://news.yahoo.com/ap-investigation-womens-prison-fostered-140401465.html
