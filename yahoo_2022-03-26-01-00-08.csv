3/26/2022,"A professional comedian is earning lots of praise after sharing his insight into how much TikTokers make per video view. The 25-year-old comic, Ben Brainard, posted the revealing clip in early 2021. Since then, the video has helped drive an ongoing debate about how much TikTok pays its top creators. The do's and don'ts of switching auto insurance policies to save money Brainard has more than 2.4 million followers on TikTok, where he posts as @ben_brainard, and around 375,000 followers on YouTube. Despite that difference, he says he makes far more money from YouTube. Brainard begins his clip by discussing some of his issues with TikTok’s financial infrastructure, while also acknowledging that the app has been “great” for his career. Then Brainard breaks down his earnings. Around the two-minute, 20-second mark, he shows how much he made from TikTok, YouTube and Facebook during the month of December. According to Brainard, he made $4,046 from his Facebook videos in December 2021, or $2.53 per thousand views. On Youtube, he made $5,267, or $0.26 per thousand views. Meanwhile, TikTok paid him $476, which was about $0.02 per thousand video views. This was despite the fact that his TikTok page drew the most views of all three platforms. Brainard’s breakdown came in response to a megapopular YouTube video by vlogger Hank Green. In that clip, Green criticized TikTok for “underpaying” its creators. One of the issues Green and Brainard both pointed to is the fact that YouTube pays creators through a somewhat straightforward monetization system. Basically, top-tier YouTubers earn 55% of all ad revenue earned from their videos. Meanwhile, TikTok’s monetization comes through its Creator Fund, which pays out a small portion of earnings to any eligible creator who earns more than 100,000 views per month. While those earnings are also dependent on video views, the scale is often much smaller than on other platforms. Comedian LaLa lives out her high school fantasy and splurges on vintage Chanel and Louis Vuitton: The reasons for this disparity are complicated, but a big part of it comes from the fact that TikTok’s Creator Fund comes from a preset, finite pool of money. So, as more TikTokers hit that 100,000 view threshold, each piece of the fund gets smaller and smaller. “When TikTok becomes more successful, TikTokers become less successful,” Green said in his video. Brainard earned plenty of praise for discussing these issues so openly. Many popular TikTokers chimed in as well. “I make pennies on average each day,” one user wrote. “Love the transparency,” another added. “Thanks for speaking up on this!” another wrote.

3/26/2022,"A New Jersey man has been arrested, accused of causing his 12-year-old nephew’s overdose death by forcing him to clean up drug paraphernalia that contained fentanyl. Troy Nokes, 35, was hit with a slew of charges Monday, including first-degree aggravated manslaughter and endangering the welfare of a child, in connection with the death of his nephew, the Camden County Prosecutor’s Office and Gloucester Township Police announced in a news release. The young boy, who was not identified, lived in the Blackwood, New Jersey, home where Nokes had allegedly manufactured fentanyl, the release said. The child found unresponsive on a school bus on Jan. 24 this year, the release said. The boy was hospitalized and succumbed to his injuries on Feb. 1. His cause of death was ruled drug intoxication, specifically fentanyl, according to the City of Philadelphia Office of the Medical Examiner’s Office. Nokes allegedly manufactured the drug the weekend before the child’s death and allegedly directed the child to clean up paraphernalia that contained fentanyl, prosecutors said. Witnesses indicated the boy was not wearing gloves at the time, the release stated. In addition to manslaughter, Nokes was also charged with first-degree strict liability drug-induced death, first degree maintaining a controlled dangerous substance production facility, employing a juvenile in a drug distribution scheme, witness tampering, tampering with evidence, hindering apprehension and aggravated assault, among other charges, the release stated. A woman named Joanna Johnson was also charged in the case with tampering of evidence and hindering Nokes’ arrest, prosecutors said. NBC Philadelphia reported Johnson is Nokes' girlfriend. Gloucester Township Police Chief David Harkins told the station the grandmother and caretaker of the child is ""devastated."" ""And she is losing a family member now who’s going into the criminal justice system to be prosecuted. But more importantly, she’s lost her 12-year-old grandson,"" Harkins said. Nokes and Johnson were arrested by the United States Marshals Service Regional Fugitive Task Force Thursday. They are being held at the Camden County Correctional Facility pending a pretrial detention hearing. Lawyer information for the pair was not immediately available. The investigation is ongoing. Medical experts have said that fentanyl exposure alone does not cause overdoses. Ryan Marino, medical director for toxicology and addiction at University Hospitals in Cleveland previously told NBC News that “While fentanyl remains a serious danger to anyone using substances, casual exposure alone is not, and victims of overdose should be treated without delay or hesitation because every second counts.” The Drug Policy Alliance also said on Twitter, “it is not possible to overdose on fentanyl or fentanyl analogues through accidental skin contact or from close proximity alone. Gloves are enough."" Police are asking with anyone with additional information in the case to contact local authorities or sent anonymous tips to ccpotips@ccprosecutor.org.",U.S./NBC News,"New Jersey boy, 12, dies of fentanyl overdose after cleaning uncle's drug paraphernalia, prosecutors say",https://news.yahoo.com/jersey-boy-12-dies-fentanyl-142607215.html
