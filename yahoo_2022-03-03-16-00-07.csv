3/3/2022,"By Maki Shiraki and Jamie Freed TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Airlines Co Ltd and ANA Holdings Inc said they would cancel all flights to and from Europe on Thursday, citing safety concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The airlines, which normally use Russian airspace for their Europe flights, join a growing number of carriers that have cancelled or rerouted flights between Europe and north Asia in the wake of the crisis. ""We are continuously monitoring the situation, but given the present situation in Ukraine and the different risks, we have decided to cancel flights,"" a JAL spokesperson told Reuters. ANA Cargo's website said the suspension of flights was due to the ""high possibility of its operations not being able to overfly Russia due to the current Ukraine situation."" Airlines from the European Union and Canada have been banned from Russian airspace in response to their curbs on Russian airlines, but Japan has not made a similar announcement to date. ANA and JAL operate about 60 flights per week through Russian airspace between Tokyo and London, Paris, Frankfurt, and Helsinki, according to a spokesperson for flight tracking website FlightRadar24. Finnair, which had initially cancelled its Tokyo flights after losing access to Russian airspace, said on Wednesday it would resume four weekly Helsinki-Tokyo flights with a new route and a flight time of 13 hours, up from around 9.5 hours previously. Longer routes by airlines will add to fuel costs and lower the amount of cargo that can be carried in a tight market for air freight that is exacerbating pandemic-related issues in the global supply chain. Korean Air Lines was still flying over Russian airspace on Thursday, according to Reuters monitoring of FlightRadar24, but Taiwanese carriers are now avoiding Russian airspace and are flying over China and central Asia. ANA said it would also cancel eight flights to and from London, Paris and Frankfurt on Friday. A Tokyo-Brussels flight due to carry vaccines on the return leg will be routed over central Asia, it said, adding all cargo flights will operate.

3/3/2022,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said France would probably not put up a fight against a Russian invasion. DeSantis said ""a lot of other places"" would ""just fold the minute there's any type of adversity."" The governor also likened Vladimir Putin to ""an authoritarian gas station attendant."" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis says he thinks that countries like France would ""probably not"" put up a fight against a Russian invasion. ""A lot of other places around the world, they just fold the minute there's any type of adversity,"" DeSantis told reporters at an event at the University of South Florida in Tampa on Wednesday. DeSantis was there to announce a $20 million grant program for cybersecurity training. ""I mean can you imagine if he (Putin) went into France? Would they do anything to put up a fight? Probably not,"" DeSantis said. DeSantis also offered a take on Putin, communism, and why the US should develop its own energy resources to reduce its dependence on Russian oil. ""You know, I analogize him to basically an authoritarian gas station attendant,"" DeSantis said of Putin. ""You look at their country, it's a hollowed-out country but for the energy. And yes they have legacy nuclear weapons, which makes them much more dangerous than if they didn't have those,"" DeSantis said. ""And so (Putin) is being fueled because America is not serious about energy independence. Right now Europe is not serious at all. So Europe is funding this guy. So he has the ability now to go in and flex muscle,"" DeSantis continued. DeSantis said that he thought Ukraine had ""done a lot better than people thought"" by holding the Russian military onslaught off for now, but added that Ukrainians would likely suffer ""death by a thousand cuts"" through guerilla warfare. The Florida governor's comments come at a time when France is facing threats from Russian officials of a ""real war."" Ukraine has fiercely resisted Russia's invasion, which began on Thursday. On Wednesday, the city of Kherson, home to nearly 300,000 residents, became the first major Ukrainian city to fall to Russian forces.
