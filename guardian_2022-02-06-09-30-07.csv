2/6/2022,"The Peruvian prime minister Héctor Valer confirmed on Saturday that he will step down just four days after being named for the post, after allegations that he beat his daughter and late wife. On Friday, President Pedro Castillo said he would reshuffle the cabinet again, after just three days, amid widespread condemnation of his appointment of Valer as prime minister.  On Saturday there was no sign of when the reshuffle may take place. Castillo must name his fourth cabinet in just six months in office, as Peru teeters on the brink of a leadership vacuum and there are calls for the former rural primary school teacher to resign. Using combative language, Valer accused the political right of forcing his resignation based on false accusations of domestic violence. “The complaints against me are based on lies,” he said, visibly angered. “I have come to leave a drop of blood to support the construction of this government.” Hours after Valer’s appointment on Tuesday, police reports emerged from 2016 in which his daughter and late wife accuse him of gender violence. One complaint filed by his 29-year-old daughter which was seen by the Guardian detailed that he “slapped, punched and kicked her in the face” as well as pulled her hair. Valer has denied the allegations and said the reports were fake. Under the Peruvian constitution, when the prime minister steps down the entire cabinet must follow suit until a replacement is nominated and a new ministerial team is chosen. Women’s rights groups protested against Valer’s appointment, and three fellow ministers also called for him to step down. The ultra-conservative Valer – who opposes sex education and has a history of sexist remarks – entered as a lawmaker with a far-right party before switching to a party that supported Castillo. Castillo, a member of a Marxist-Leninist party Perú Libre, has moved increasingly to the right since taking office last July. Though nominally leftist, he expressed socially conservative views opposing LGBTQ rights, legal abortion and sex education which differed little from those of his far-right opponents, before taking office. Suspicions about his leftist credentials were further fanned when he was photographed laughing and smiling with far-right Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who at one point put on Castillo’s trademark wide-brimmed hat, at a bilateral meeting on Thursday. In a national address on Friday, Castillo accused congress and his former ministers of “feeding instability and political uncertainty” but made no mention of the accusations against Valer. However, analysts point to a crisis of leadership for the president who has never before held public office. “Pedro Castillo’s presence in the government is the main problem,” said Fernando Tuesta, a political science professor at Lima’s Pontifical Catholic University.

2/6/2022,"Millions of British homes are preparing for a cost of living crisis prompted by the global gas supply crunch, but the high market prices mean big revenues for the world’s fossil fuel giants. That includes BP, which is forecast to reveal a historic return to multibillion-dollar profits in its results this week. The oil company is expected to have raked in a profit of almost $4bn for the final quarter of last year, compared with a thin $115m in the same period the year before, in large part due to record-breaking energy market prices around the globe.  The surge in global gas markets through the final months of 2021, combined with an oil price rally to seven-year highs, could catapult the company to a full-year profit of $12.6bn (£9.3bn) compared with a loss of $5.7bn in 2020. The same trend is visible in the US, where oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron have in the past week reported net profits of $23bn and $15.6bn respectively for last year – the highest since 2014, when crude last traded above $100 a barrel. The scale of BP’s return to profit will come as little surprise to those who recall the claim in December by its chief executive, Bernard Looney, that the energy crisis had transformed the company into a “cash machine”. Some people may be tempted to use “outrage generator” as a more apt description, following last week’s news that the gas market highs will also lead to record high energy bills and drive millions of households into fuel poverty. On Thursday, Shell reported a quadrupling of profits, fuelling fresh calls for the UK Treasury to impose a windfall tax on companies that stand to benefit from the energy crisis, in order to fund extra help for hard-hit households. Shell reported better than expected profits of $6.4bn in the final quarter of last year, compared with earnings of $393m a year earlier. Its chief executive, Ben van Beurden, described the profit surge to $19.3bn in 2021, compared with $4.85bn the year before, as a “momentous year” for the company. It was pretty significant for its shareholders too: the company raised its dividends by 4% and opened an $8.5bn share buyback programme. A windfall for investors is one thing. But handouts for hard-pressed families appear to be another matter entirely. “I am not convinced that windfall taxes – popular though they may seem – is going to help us with supply, nor is it going to help us with demand,” Van Beurden said. “But, of course, we stand ready to be in dialogue with government on all the measures that we can collectively take.” For BP and Shell, the campaign to re-establish their social licences to operate amid growing climate consciousness is likely to be made more challenging by feelings of resentment from households struggling to make ends meet while the oil industry enjoys a bonanza. The challenge looks likely to last for years. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, warned in an address on Thursday that the UK was “going to have to adjust to” greater costs, telling households to prepare for higher energy bills in the autumn. The woes facing households could stretch far further into the future than the return of cold weather. Global market experts, including the Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs, have predicted that higher energy prices could persist into 2025.

2/6/2022,"The punters very much had the upper hand at last year’s Dublin Racing Festival, with seven favourites and a second-favourite winning the eight Grade One events, and Honeysuckle (3.00) will be a short price to retain her unbeaten record in the Irish Champion Hurdle at Leopardstown on Sunday, on what promises to be another afternoon when market leaders dominate. Rachael Blackmore’s mount will set off at around 1-3 and and while this is her first meeting with Zanahiyr, one of last season’s leading juveniles, he has 6lb to find on the official ratings and Henry de Bromhead’s runner also gets a 7lb mares’ allowance.  Saint Roi, meanwhile, was 21 lengths behind Honeysuckle 12 months ago and anything other than a 14th straight win for Honeysuckle will be as much a surprise as it is a disappointment. Leopardstown 1.20 Galopin Des Champs could hardly have done any more when making his chase debut at the Christmas meeting here, winning by 22 lengths with any amount in hand. Musselburgh 1.32 Inca Prince has made rapid progress since joining Ruth Jefferson in the autumn and would be a match for likely favourite Impulsive One if reproducing the form of either of his recent wins. Leopardstown 1.50 The bare form of the Tingle Creek at Sandown in December gives Chacun Pour Soi plenty to find with Greaneteen, but he is likely to be a different proposition back on home turf. Musselburgh 2.05 Little to choose here between promising novices Since Day One and Restandbethankful, but Donald McCain’s runner remains unbeaten over hurdles and may have the greater scope for improvement. Leopardstown 2.25 It is difficult to find a runner without some sort of chance in this fearsomely competitive handicap chase. Minella Times, last season’s Grand National winner, will get plenty of attention ahead of the publication of this year’s Aintree weights later this month while Samcro and The Shunter are other familiar names in the 17-strong field but Rebel Gold, a close second at Limerick in December in a race run in a useful time, may be the pick of the prices at around 16-1. Musselburgh 2.40 Brorson has taken a 13lb hike in the weights after his latest success at Southwell but he won with any amount in hand there and even his new mark may underestimate his potential at staying trips.

Leopardstown 3.35 Sir Gerhard is the only Grade One favourite on Sunday’s card who might start at odds-against, and Three Stripe Life looks overpriced at around 9-2 to beat him.

2/6/2022,"More than a third of the American population is currently experiencing rapid, above-average rates of temperature increase, with 499 counties already breaching 1.5C (2.7F) of heating, a Guardian review of climate data shows. The US as a whole has heated up over the past century due to the release of planet-warming gases from burning fossil fuels, and swathes of the US west, northeast and upper midwest – representing more than 124.6 million people – have recorded soaring increases since federal government temperature records began in 1895.  Though the climate crisis is convulsing the US, it is doing so unevenly. Hotspots of extreme warming have emerged in many of America’s largest cities, and places as diverse as California’s balmy coast to the previously frigid northern reaches of Minnesota, while other places, particularly in the south, have barely seen their temperatures budge. “The warming isn’t distributed evenly,” said Brian Brettschneider, an Alaska-based climate scientist who collated the county temperature data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). “Many places have seen dramatic changes, but there are always some places below the average who will think, ‘It didn’t seem that warm to me.’ The impacts differ depending where you are.” Ventura county in California has heated up more than any other county in the contiguous US, according to the Noaa data, experiencing a 2.6C (4.75F) increase in total warming in the period from 1895 to 2021. Meanwhile, counties that include many of America’s largest cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Philadelphia, San Fransisco and Boston, have all seen their average temperatures rise far beyond the national average, which stands at around a 1C (1.8F) increase on pre-industrial times. Mark Jackson, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service based in Oxnard in Ventura county said the county’s temperature increase is “a remarkable number, it’s a scary number when you consider the pace we are looking at”. Jackson said the county has seen a large increase in heatwaves, including a spell above 37C (100F) last summer that “really stressed” the local community. Ventura county, which hugs the Californian coast northwest of Los Angeles, is known for a pleasant Mediterranean climate cooled slightly by the proximity of the ocean. But Jackson said that recent heatwaves have seen warm air flow down from mountains in the nearby Los Padres National Forest to the coast, while the ocean itself is being roiled by escalating temperatures. “It’s been really remarkable to see it get that hot right up to the coast,” he said. California is in the grip of its most severe drought in 1,200 years and scientists say this is fueling the heat seen in many places in the state – Los Angeles has warmed by 2.3C (4.2F) since 1895, while Santa Barbara has jumped by 2.4C (4.38F) – by reducing moisture in soils, which then bake more quickly. Higher temperatures are also worsening the risk of wildfires in the state. “We lost everything,” said Tyler Suchman, founder of online marketing firm Tribal Core who in 2017 fled with his wife to escape a huge wildfire that razed their home in Ojai, in Ventura county. “It was harrowing. The winds were blowing like crazy and the hills lining the highway were all on fire, I had never seen anything like it.” Just 11 months later, a separate wildfire destroyed the couple’s next home, in Malibu, as their neighbor scooped up water from his hot tub in a desperate attempt to tackle the flames. “No one wants us to move next to them now,” Suchman said. “You can see how the area has changed over the 18 years since we moved to Ojai. It’s a beautiful place but regretfully we can’t live there now, the risk is too great.” Hotspots of above-average warming are found across the US. Grand county in Utah, a place of sprawling deserts, cliffs and plateaus, is the second fastest warming county in the lower 48 states, while every county in New Jersey, Massachusetts and Connecticut has warmed by more than 1.5C (2.7F) since 1895. It’s the more northern latitudes that have experienced the most extreme recent heat, however, with counties in Alaska making up all of the top six fastest warming places since 1970 (comparable temperature data for Alaska does not go back further than the 1920s). Alaska’s North slope, situated within the rapidly warming Arctic, has heated up by an enormous 3.7C (6.6F) in just the past 50 years. “There really is a climate shift underway in Alaska, everyone can see things are different than they used to be and everyone is concerned about what the future here will look like,” said Brettschneider, who said even his teenage children have noticed the retreat of sea ice, an elongating fire season and a dearth of cold days. The warmth is also melting frozen soils, known as permafrost, causing buildings to subside and roads to buckle. “If you drive on the roads near Fairbanks you better have a strong stomach because it feels like you’re riding a rollercoaster,” said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy. Other locations that traditionally used to severe cold have also seen sharp temperature increases. Roseau and Kittson counties, in northern Minnesota, are both in the top five fastest warming counties in the lower 48 states, with their warming driven by winters that have heated up by around 3.8C (7F) in the state since modern record keeping began. Winters are warming more quickly than summers because more heat usually escapes the land during the colder months, but it is now being trapped by greenhouse gases. “Some might say ‘well I like warmer winters’ but people are noticing negative impacts, such as changes to the growing season and the loss of cultural practices such as cross-country skiing races,” said Heidi Roop, a climate scientist at the University of Minnesota. “Even small temperature changes have big consequences.” Globally, governments set a goal in the 2015 Paris climate agreement to avoid a temperature rise of 1.5C (2.7F) above the pre-industrial era. Beyond this point, scientists say, the world will face increasingly punishing heatwaves, storms, flooding and societal unrest. While certain areas of the US have already passed 1.5C, the important metric is still the global average, Hayhoe said. “In some places a 2C increase is fine but 2.5C is when the wheels fall off the bus, some locations are OK with 5ft of sea level rise because of their elevation while others can’t cope with 5 in because they are low-lying,” she said. “Local vulnerability is very customized. What’s relevant for communities is whether the world meets its targets or not, it’s a collective target for the world.” That global threshold is in severe peril, with some forecasts warning that 1.5C (2.7F) could be breached within a decade without drastic cuts to carbon emissions. Communities will need to brace themselves for the consequences of this, according to Roop. “The warming we are seeing is pushing at the bounds of lived human experience, of what we thought was possible,” she said. “We are paying the costs for that and we need to prepare for the changes already set in motion, as well as to prevent further warming.”",News/Environment,Visualized: a third of Americans already face above-average warming,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/05/americans-above-average-temperature-increase-climate-crisis
2/6/2022,"Chris Eubank Jr moved closer to a meaningful fight on the world stage when he knocked down Liam Williams four times on his way to a wide and decisive victory on points in their middleweight bout over 12 rounds in Cardiff on Saturday night. Despite a fervent crowd’s vociferous support for Williams, who grew up in the Rhondda Valley, just over 20 miles from Cardiff, Eubank’s sharp left hand quelled the animosity. Williams came out fast, looking to back up Eubank as booming chants of “Liam, Liam, Liam” echoed around the heaving arena. The Welshman looked confident, even smirking at his reviled opponent before, in Eubank’s corner near the end of round one, he walked straight into a sharp straight left hand. Williams was knocked down, looking as surprised as he was hurt.  The pattern of the fight had been set and in round two Williams went down again after he was tagged by a Eubank jab, right cross and a left hook. Roy Jones Jr, the great former world champion who now trains Eubank, urged his fighter to “take your time” and stay patient. Eubank listened and cruised through the third, only drawing the ire of the referee after he tagged Williams once the bell rang. A more legitimate punch, another straight left, sent Williams back to the familiar territory of the canvas for another count of eight in round four. Those three knockdowns should have sealed a conclusive end but Williams has immense grit and courage and he refused to buckle. He was helped by the fact that, through the middle rounds, Eubank spent more time taunting Williams and the crowd rather than concentrating on the basics which had allowed him to dominate the fight until then. Williams kept coming forward and he was encouraged further by Eubank’s wasteful showboating. He landed a few decent shots and by the ninth round his hopeful supporters were roaring him on in pursuit of the stoppage he desperately needed. Williams had won a number of rounds but his face told the true story of the fight. A purple swelling under his right eye seemed to trouble him as he blinked repeatedly. Williams still shouted defiantly at Eubank when the bell for the tenth round sounded. But he went down again in the eleventh – even though it looked more like a push than an effective punch. At the start of the twelfth and last round, the referee applauded both men and they at least tapped gloves in a sign of mutual respect. Williams tried hard but the four knockdowns had been decisive. An increasingly bitter build-up to the fight had ratcheted up the intensity as both Williams and Eubank stressed their dislike for each other. Williams, who understands the sombre risks of boxing after seeing tragedy in the ring on two separate occasions, spoke with surprising stupidity on Friday when he said: “Eubank makes my skin crawl. I want to kill him.” Eubank punished him for his crass comments. Williams operates at a level below the world’s best middleweight boxers but he does not deserve to become just a hand-picked opponent, and stepping stone for much younger fighters on the rise. After 28 fights, and this fourth shattering defeat it could be time for Williams to look towards a different life beyond the ropes. For Eubank Jr, however, bigger fights now await. He knows that, at world title level, he will face fighters far more accomplished and deadly than the valiant Williams. But, at least for a while longer, the Eubank show rolls on and the combination of a 32-2 record, his familiar name and trademark fast mouth add a slick gloss to this clear victory. On the undercard, Claressa Shields, the former double Olympic champion, retained her WBA, WBC and IBF world middleweight titles with a dominant performance against Ema Kozin from Slovenia. Kozin was unbeaten after 22 fights but as soon as she stepped into the ring against Shields, who calls herself the GWOAT – Greatest Woman of All Time – the disparity in quality was obvious. Shields hurt Kozin early in the second round and, full of menacing intent and throwing punishing combinations, she moved through the gears with ominous ease. Kozin, however, was brave and clung on until the final bell of a painfully one-sided contest. Shields will be back in the UK later this year when she faces Savannah Marshall, the outstanding WBO champion from Hartlepool, and the only woman to have ever beaten her in a boxing ring. They were amateurs then but, after the American left the ring having dismantled Kozin in Cardiff, Shields and Marshall exchanged feisty words. They are destined for a compelling fight that will elevate women’s boxing this summer. Caroline Dubois, who beat Vaida Masiokaite from Lithuania convincingly on points in her professional debut, was thrilled to be fighting just before Shields – a fighter she reveres. She boxed with assurance, fast hand speed and some poise to win all six rounds. Her 34-year-old opponent was happy to avoid a stoppage and did nothing to trouble Dubois. It was an encouraging start for the highly-touted Olympian and, at the age of 21, Dubois can enjoy this impressively easy win before harder tests emerge as she moves up the lightweight ranks. But one of the most promising careers in British boxing is now under way.",Sport/Sport,Chris Eubank Jr eyes world stage after points win over Liam Williams,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/05/chris-eubank-jr-eyes-world-stage-after-points-win-over-liam-williams
