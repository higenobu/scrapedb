1/30/2022,"Waiting for Russia to invade Ukraine feels a bit like Waiting for Godot. In this edgy reworking of Samuel Beckett’s masterpiece, Russia’s leader, Vladimir Putin, is cast, appropriately, as the restless Vladimir while the US president, Joe Biden, is the bowler-hatted Estragon, frequently dozing off. The play’s central conceit is that the mysterious Godot, expected at any moment, never actually arrives. After Russia agreed last week to keep talking, Ukraine’s citizens have reason to hope the crisis will turn out to be a comparably vacuous non-event – a peculiarly Putin-esque contribution to the theatre of the absurd.  The border standoff, which commenced in earnest in November, has lasted so long that the tea leaf-reading Biden reckons Russia “has to do something”. This penetrating Mystic Meg analysis is not necessarily correct. No one, perhaps not even Putin, knows whether “something” will happen today, next month, or never. Continuing the existentialist theme, even the definition of “invasion” is endlessly debated. Biden anticipates a D-day-scale Russian operation. But many analysts expect any attack to be fast, covert and asymmetrical, using special forces, sabotage and cyberwarfare, as in the Donbas in 2014. While this slightly surreal waiting game continues, it’s possible, and instructive to assess what damage has already been done – and which individuals and countries are winning or losing so far in Ukraine’s phoney war. For example, Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s brand-new foreign minister and co-leader of the Greens, has had a good war to date. Ignoring chauvinist sneers about her inexperience and gender, she faced down Sergei Lavrov, her grisly Russian counterpart, when they met recently in Moscow. In contrast, her boss, Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz, is having a miserable time of it. His prevarication over what anti-Russia sanctions Berlin may support, and his blocking of arms supplies to Ukraine, has raised wider questions about his competence – and about German leadership in Europe. Having long resisted American pressure to scrap the newly completed Nord Stream 2 gas Baltic pipeline from Russia, Scholz last week appeared to cave. It’s been an unlucky beginning for Angela Merkel’s less popular successor. France’s Emmanuel Macron, facing a spring presidential election, is struggling to reconcile his vision of European “strategic autonomy” with the reality of continuing dependence on Nato, amid offstage jeering from Britain’s Boris Johnson. “We will never give up dialogue with Moscow,” Macron declares. But his bridge-building is repeatedly undermined by Putin’s recidivism, symbolised by the 2020 poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Undeterred, Macron continues to pursue “de-escalation” and a “European solution”. Yet how real is that? Putin insists on dealing with the US, not the EU, which he disdains and has deliberately bypassed. The so-called “Normandy format” talks finally resumed in Paris last week. But Brussels, sliding towards irrelevance, is the big loser so far in the undeclared war for Ukraine. The opposite may be said, surprisingly, of Nato. Obituaries were written for the 30-member alliance after last year’s Afghanistan humiliation. Macron famously declared it “brain dead”. Yet now, thanks to master-strategist Putin, Nato is experiencing a mini-renaissance. “Frontline” east European states have scurried under its protective umbrella, appealing successfully for more troops and weapons. There is revived talk of membership for Finland and Sweden. Even more improbably, Putin’s Beckett-like inscrutability has changed Washington’s calculations, as analyst Paul Taylor noted. “Putin’s grandstanding has dragged the US back deeper into European security, just when two successive American presidents had tried to pivot Washington’s strategic focus toward China,” Taylor wrote. This is a big plus for Moscow’s ally, President Xi Jinping, who feels the same way about Taiwan as Putin does about Ukraine. Other authoritarian regimes are also enjoying the drama. The heat is off Iran’s mullahs. And who among western leaders is focusing on mayhem in Myanmar, Yemen or Tigray – or on resurgent Islamic State terror in Syria and the Sahel? Ukraine’s unlikely president, Volodymyr Zelensky, formerly an itinerant thespian and comic, eschews a bowler hat – but is playing well to foreign audiences in the role of valiant underdog. Concerns about official corruption in Kyiv, democratic deficits, and Donbas intransigence have been brushed aside by the likes of Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary. In her simplistic analysis, it’s about freedom versus tyranny. Truss, a jet-setting Margaret Thatcher imitator, is not having a good war. Like her predecessor Dominic Raab during the Afghan withdrawal, she went walkabout as the Ukraine crisis peaked, blundering around in Australia when she and the baying, terminally distracted Johnson should have been leading the charge to keep the peace in Europe. What of the principal architect of this protracted imbroglio? The US-based Russia expert, Fiona Hill, says Putin is winning without firing a shot. “He has the US right where he wants it,” Hill wrote. A “master of coercive inducement”, he was advancing his overall aim to evict America from Europe to belatedly avenge the Soviet Union’s defeat. Maybe. It’s true Putin has succeeded in forcing the US to focus on Russia’s security concerns, including future missile deployments and Nato exercises. He will keep up the military and diplomatic pressure for now, to see what concessions and freebies he can get. But Washington will not agree to freeze Ukraine out of Nato or remake Europe’s post-cold war security structures, and Putin surely knows it. Meanwhile, his aggressive tactics have rallied the fractious western democracies and stiffened opposition to his regime. While a watching world is waiting for Putin, Biden is threatening to sanction him personally, as urged in this space last week. Like a thief in the night looking to see what he can grab, Russia’s leader makes a pariah of himself and his country on the global stage. War or no war, real or imaginary, that look likes defeat.",Opinion/Opinion,Waiting for Putin: Russia’s phoney war is playing out as surreal theatre,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/30/ukraine-putin-russia-phoney-war-surreal-theatre
1/30/2022,"Just on the evidence of his new book, Ro Khanna is one of the broadest, brightest and best-educated legislators on Capitol Hill. A graduate of the University of Chicago and Yale Law School who represents Silicon Valley, he is by far the most tech-savvy member of Congress.  At this very dark moment for American democracy, this remarkable son of Indian immigrants writes with the optimism and idealism of a first-generation American who still marvels at the opportunities he has had. Even more remarkable for a congressman whose district includes Apple, Google, Intel and Yahoo, Khanna is one of the few who refuses to take campaign money from political action committees. Once or twice in a “heated basketball game” in high school, he writes, someone may have shouted “go back to India!” But what Khanna mostly remembers about his childhood are neighbors in Pennsylvania’s Bucks county who taught him “to believe that dreams are worth pursuing in America, regardless of one’s name or heritage”. His book is bulging with ideas about how to transform big tech from a huge threat to liberty into a genuine engine of democracy. What he is asking for is almost impossibly ambitious, but he never sounds daunted. “Instead of passively allowing tech royalty and their legions to lead the digital revolution and serve narrow financial ends before all others,” he writes, “we need to put it in service of our broader democratic aspirations. We need to steer the ship [and] call the shots.” The story of tech is emblematic of our time of singular inequality, a handful of big winners on top and a vast population untouched by the riches of the silicon revolution. Khanna begins his book with a barrage of statistics. Ninety percent of “innovation job growth” in recent decades has been in five cities while 50% of digital service jobs are in just 10 major metro centers. Most Americans “are disconnected from the wealth generation of the digital economy”, he writes, “despite having their industries and … lives transformed by it”. A central thesis is that no person should be forced to leave their hometown to find a decent job. There is one big reason for optimism about this huge aspiration: the impact of Covid. Practically overnight, the pandemic “shattered” conventional wisdom “about tech concentration”. Suddenly it was obvious that high-speed broadband allowed “millions of jobs to be done anywhere in the nation”. The willingness of millions of Americans to leave big city life is confirmed by red-hot real estate markets in far flung towns and villages – and a Harris poll that showed nearly 40% of city dwellers were willing to live elsewhere. “The promise is of new jobs without sudden cultural displacement,” Khanna writes. He suggests a range of incentives to spread tech jobs into rural areas, including big federal investment to bring high-speed connections to the millions still without them. This is turn would make it possible to require federal contractors to have at least 10% of their workforces in rural communities. The congressman imagines nothing less than a “recentering” of “human values in a culture that prizes the pursuit of technological progress and market valuations”. A vital step in that direction would be a $5bn investment for laptops for 11 million students who don’t have them. The problems of inequality begin at the tech giants themselves. Almost 20% of computer science graduates are black or Latino but only 10% of employees of big tech companies are. Less than 3% of venture capital lands in the hands of Black or Latino entrepreneurs. If redistributing some of big tech’s gigantic wealth is one way to regain some dignity in the digital age, the other is to rein in some of the industry’s gigantic abuses. Data mining and the promotion of hate for profit are the two biggest problems. Khanna has drafted an Internet Bill of Rights to improve the situation. Throughout his book, he drops bits of evidence to suggest just how urgent it is to find a way to make the biggest companies behave better. “Algorithmic amplification” turns out to be one of the greatest evils of the modern age. After extracting huge amounts of data about users, Facebook and the other big platforms “push sensational and divisive content to susceptible users based on their profiles”. An internal discussion at Facebook revealed that “64% of all extremist group joins are due to our recommendations”. The explosion of the bizarre QAnon is one of Facebook’s most dubious accomplishments. In the three years before it finally banned it in 2020, “QAnon groups developed millions of followers as Facebook’s algorithm encouraged people to join based on their profiles. Twitter also recommended Qanon tweets”. The conspiracy theory was “actively recommended” on YouTube until 2019. And then there is the single greatest big tech crime against humanity. According to Muslim Advocates, a Washington-based civil rights group, the Buddhist junta in Myanmar used Facebook and WhatsApp to plan the mass murder of Rohingya Muslims. The United Nations found that Facebook played a “determining role” in events that led to the murder of at least 25,000 and the displacement of 700,000. The world would indeed be a much better place if it adopted Khanna’s recommendations. But the question Khanna is too optimistic to ask may also be the most important one. Have these companies already purchased too much control of the American government for any fundamental change to be possible?

1/30/2022,"“Just pat her on the bottom and send her on her way.” When, as rarely happens, Boris Johnson is forced to cooperate with women in authority, it may help that, as he’s occasionally mentioned, he possesses a fair few insights into female behaviour and woman-management, some of them perhaps gleaned from his father. Though it must be painful, given his attitude to women in the workforce, to be forced to deal with them at all. He once depicted female employment as “an ever-growing proportion of British women [who] have been ‘incentivised’ or socially gestapoed into the workplace”. When can he stop acting as if Sue Gray is his equal?  Isn’t it humiliation enough that Johnson, Big Dog, a man who publicly identifies as the Incredible Hulk, should already have been thwarted by Lady Hale, then denied revenge on another female adversary, Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards? Just last week Stone was again acting as if Hulk could be defeated by a woman, saying it is “bonkers” she can’t investigate the funding of his dodgy refurb. “The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets,” Johnson once warned fellow leaders. But the Hulk never had to deal with a police investigation, albeit heavily compromised, by three female officers. True, one is Cressida Dick, but add deputy assistant commissioner Jane Connors and commander Catherine Roper and that’s still an entire troika of nightmare “girly swots” (as Johnson describes conscientious people of either sex). DAC Connors, who expressed sadness about people “flagrantly” ignoring Covid rules, is certainly a contender for Johnson’s signature insult. Not long after declaring his proroguing of parliament illegal, Lady Hale pointedly applied it to herself. Which is the kind of thing that happens when the professions fail to learn from Johnson’s example that the correct approach to hiring women, allowing for occasional lapses, is not to do it in the first place. Even the young, blond, cheatworthy ones will end up old, like the “sweaty old peeresses”, “old bag” and “kind of woman who owns fifteen cats” referred to in Johnson’s novel Seventy Two Virgins, a fast-moving catalogue of sexist and racist slurs, set in Westminster. Like David Cameron, Johnson likes to boast about the female prime ministers who outwitted men like himself, while ensuring his own administration is modelled, thus ruling out further such anomalies, on admission arrangements at his old school. Any Tory female visibility in the Commons and cabinet should not, as became clear in reports about No 10’s lockdown lifestyle, be interpreted as evidence of progress. The most arresting aspect of the covertly photographed drinks/meeting at No 10 is, for example, less the refreshments than the quaint sex ratio, apparently 16 to three. Two of the women being the girlfriends of Matt Hancock and Boris Johnson. The latter’s insistence that these garden drinks were “people at work” conveys his confidence that an appearance of institutionalised sex discrimination will always be less shameful than booze-related rule-breaking. Written accounts of the No 10 work/booze timetable also depict a sex monoculture you’d probably blame on the prep school culture that created Johnson if that hadn’t, in comparison, been thrillingly diverse. The narrator of King Solomon’s Mines, published in 1885, at least acknowledges to his schoolboy readers that “there is not a petticoat in the whole history”. That is, except for a female fiend and “she was a hundred at least, and therefore not marriageable, so I don’t count her”. It’s still one more petticoat than you get in a Johnsonian “quad”. Questioned about the non-existent female membership of his inner cabals, with their idiot nicknames and boxing-glove accessories, Johnson has protested, like Cameron before him, that he is doing his best, helpless to correct the shortage of female candidates as accomplished as Gavin Williamson, as trustworthy as Hancock, as authoritative as Dominic Raab. After elected women were sidelined in the national Covid response, including almost entirely from public briefings, a sniggering Johnson told the parliamentary liaison committee: “It’s certainly true that I would have liked to have had more female representation in the press conferences so far.” Though not enough to do anything about it. “And, erm, you know, er, what can I say?” Keen Johnson students would have heard the echoes, here, of the Spectator column where, along with the bum-patting tip, he offered this to future editors: “You will receive threatening letters from female journalists, urging you to have more female bylines, starting with their own, and I would not dream of advising you there.” For Johnson, the persistence of women who are neither flattering nor shaggable has never stopped being hilarious. But his long-diagnosed “woman problem”, as this common-or-garden prejudice is usually euphemised, has recently taken on, thanks to difficulties entirely of Johnson’s own making, a delightful new meaning. If it’s too much, judging by last week’s evasions, to hope for poetic justice, in the shape of his subjugation by the sex he has patronised for half a century, the mortification alone is joy. While Johnson was either snogging female colleagues or declaring them unpromotable, other professional women prevailed. Now the Hulk has to answer their questions. Probably his misogyny runs too deep to allow Johnson some reflection on the possible benefits if he hadn’t presided over a frat house from which unwanted women could be summarily ejected. But if so, it will have made any impertinence on the part of middle-aged women (who may even own cats) all the more personally agonising. How agonising? Hard to say, but he once compared the horror of being overtaken by a female driver to “being treated as though you were an old woman by a young woman”.

1/30/2022,"The ghetto blasters date this picture to the early 1980s, that noisy few years when urban streets thudded with mixtape basslines from almost portable machines like these, usually carried on the shoulder. Mary Ellen Mark took the picture of the two boys, in Seattle, on assignment for Life magazine. The story was about the then relatively new phenomenon of large numbers of teenage children living on America’s streets. Seattle was chosen because it had just been voted the nation’s “most liveable city”. Mark, who died in 2015, thought of herself as a documentary photographer rather than a photojournalist. The distinction, she believed, was that she was not shooting news; her skill was “to be able to pull things from reality, to see what’s strange and real”. Her Seattle story focused on a group of teenagers, some as young as 13, who had run away from home and were surviving selling drugs or by selling themselves for sex. The lives she witnessed were so disturbing that she stayed involved with them in different ways. She tried to adopt one 13-year-old girl, Tiny, a sex worker, to remove her from the place; when that did not succeed, Mark worked with her husband, film-maker Martin Bell, to make a documentary that drew attention to these children’s lives. Streetwise was nominated for an Oscar in 1984. She stayed in touch with Tiny and the other kids throughout her life.  Mark’s photograph of the boys on the street is included in an exhibition of 20th-century street photography by women called A Female Gaze. The Seattle photographs became emblematic for her, of a kind connection that she was always looking for. “It’s interesting,” she said later in an interview. “I don’t have kids. I never really wanted kids [but] I’ve always been interested in teenagers. It’s when you can really talk to a person, being that age and out there and very raw.” A Female Gaze: Seven Decades of Women Street Photographers is at Howard Greenberg Gallery in New York until 2 April",Arts/Art and design,The big picture: Mary Ellen Mark captures teens on the streets of Seattle,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/30/the-big-picture-mary-ellen-mark-captures-teens-on-the-streets-of-seattle
1/30/2022,"Adam Rutherford begins this sharp and timely study of the science that dare not speak its name with an account of the professor who, in 2018, attempted to genetically modify the embryos of twin daughters, removing them from a woman’s womb and then reimplanting them. “China’s Frankenstein”, He Jiankui, had planned to give the children genetic immunity from HIV/Aids, a disease from which their father suffered. Though his efforts seem to have failed – the girls may not have that immunity and he was jailed for three years and fined three million yuan – the case provides one stark answer to Rutherford’s opening question: “If you have children, you will surely want them to live well. You hope that they are free from disease, and that they fulfil their potential … what are you willing to do to ensure this?” Ever since Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein in response to the new sciences of physiology and galvanism, that question has haunted human imaginations. After Darwin and before the Third Reich, eugenics was a science that was embraced, as Rutherford notes, by “suffragists, feminists, philosophers and more than a dozen Nobel prizewinners … [and] was a beacon of light for many countries striving to be better, healthier and stronger”.  The first part of Rutherford’s book is a history of these arguments; the second is concerned with the way this thinking is expressed in the present. Ideas of selective breeding are almost as old as philosophy. Plato proposed a utopian city state in which elite men and women would be matched for their qualities, and “inferior” citizens would be discouraged or prevented from breeding. In modern biology, such ideas were first explored and popularised by Darwin’s half-cousin Francis Galton and his follower Karl Pearson at University College London. Galton’s idea of “positive eugenics” carried with it those ever-present, class-based fears of the decline of civilisation (Darwin did not call it The Descent of Man for nothing). His theories of selective breeding counted among their disciples a young Winston Churchill; the creator of the welfare state, William Beveridge; and the birth control pioneer Marie Stopes, who feared the consequences of the working class “outbreeding” a social elite, and advocated the sterilisation of mixed-race girls. Rutherford traces a clear line from these racist theories – widely acted upon in US prewar sterilisation programmes – to the genocidal atrocities of nazism. He also shows that though the “doctors’ trial” at Nuremberg effectively banished the word “eugenics” from any curriculum, the science – and in some cases the politics that exploited it – persisted. The horror of using forced sterilisation to pursue racial purity did not end with the Third Reich; in Canada there is an ongoing class action in response to the coerced sterilisation of First Nation women, some as recently as 2018, while in the US, there is an allegation that up to 20 women underwent involuntary sterilisation in immigration detention centres in 2020. In China, meanwhile, there are credible reports that 80% of Uyghur women detained in the Xinjiang region have been sterilised by surgery or IUD. Rutherford is careful to separate those attempts at population control from the human genetics departments that have evolved with the fundamental aim of understanding disease at a heritable level. IVF embryos can today be screened for a number of genetic diseases; he makes the clear case that none of these interventions are eugenics, and all are tightly regulated across the world. Scientists have been manipulating and editing genes since the 1970s – initially viruses and then more complex organisms. Today, Rutherford suggests, “anyone with basic lab equipment can piece together bits and bobs from multiple species to build a new living tool with a specific purpose – such as to test for pathogens in the environment, or create vaccines”. Technology called Crispr created in the last decade can precisely seek out an individual bit of DNA to modify or delete or edit it, “potentially correcting a mutation that for all history until this moment has produced untold suffering”. However, the idea that scientists are capable of remodelling more complex inherited human traits is, he argues, as far-fetched and politically dangerous as ever. Those headline studies that claim to have “found the gene for” are almost never right. The inherited bits of DNA that might reveal a propensity to alcoholism or schizophrenia are not restricted to single genes but to the variants of multiple bits of DNA, which even then do not determine anything. As Philip Larkin noted in This Be the Verse, parents are pre-programmed to “fill you with the faults they had/ And add some extra, just for you.” The most pernicious of these claims inevitably involves the belief, resurgent in extremist political groups, that we might genetically select for IQ. In the largest studies, inherited intelligence has been associated with the variable interaction of more than 1,000 places in the human genome. That does not stop a few scientists and pseudoscientists repackaging Galton’s “positive eugenics” for the 21st century. Among the most prominent of these hucksterish voices is Stephen Hsu, a former physicist and administrator at Michigan State University. Hsu, who runs a genetic profiling company, has been vocal in promoting the possibility of selecting for intelligence and thereby creating a super race of humans with “IQs of 1000”. In 2014, Dominic Cummings saw a talk by Hsu, swallowed his thinking whole and regurgitated it in a breathless blog. Five years later, Hsu was pictured with Cummings outside 10 Downing Street, by which time the “new” eugenics had caused headlines and outrage after the notorious, secretive 2017 “conference” at UCL involving what Rutherford calls “fringe race-obsessed science cosplayers”. Rutherford makes the urgent case that we remain very far from any such competence and we should beware any politician that raises the idea. In trying to select for the hundreds of genetic variants associated with intelligence, might you be selecting against fertility or kindness or integrity? No one knows, Rutherford says, and it is likely no one will ever know. He ends his short, illuminating book with a useful suggestion. Rather than meddling at the edges of a science that we barely understand, why not concentrate resources on that triumvirate of inventions that have, over centuries, been shown to transform and improve human capacities beyond all imagining: education, healthcare and equality of opportunity.

1/30/2022,"Johnson detailed what he meant by “getting the big calls right” in a Commons speech on 19 January. He listed the decision to focus on the booster campaign in December, not opting to use the European Medicines Agency for vaccine procurement, and investing early in lateral flow tests and “cutting-edge drugs”. He also claimed that the UK had the “fastest booster campaign in Europe” and was “first to emerge from the Omicron wave”.  He did not refer to calls which were arguably bigger: the decision to prioritise hospitals instead of care homes in March 2020, the decision not to lock down in September 2020, the failure to procure enough PPE, and the decision to largely abandon public health measures such as contact tracing in March 2020. And other issues remain to be resolved – the NHS and the social care sector have at least 200,000 vacancies between them. Up to 20,000 people could have died because of the original decision to not lock down in March 2020, according to modelling by Prof Neil Ferguson at Imperial College London. During the second wave, Johnson prioritised Christmas and did not order a lockdown until 6 January, when almost 32,000 people were in hospital and more than 4,000 were being admitted every day. More than 80,000 people died within 28 days of a positive test between 1 October 2020 and 28 February 2021. When Johnson made his claims, the UK had delivered 53.99 boosters per 100 people – behind Iceland, Denmark and Israel, while Belgium overtook the UK two days later, according to Our World In Data. Independent fact-checker Full Fact UK said the PM seemed to define this as “reaching more than half our population before any other European country”, which was only accurate if Iceland and Denmark were not counted. With the BA.2 version of Omicron apparently outcompeting the original BA.1 sublineage, and nearly 5% of people in England testing positive for Covid, according to the Office for National Statistics, it’s not clear that the UK has yet emerged from the Omicron wave. Creating the vaccine taskforce instead of using the EMA, and the early authorisation by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, meant that the UK had given a first dose to about 30% of the population by 1 March, compared with about 5% for France, Italy and Germany, according to Our World in Data. But the UK has proportionately fewer people who have taken up the vaccine than Portugal, Denmark, Italy, Ireland, France, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Finland.James Tapper The prime minister promised to create a world-beating testing programme near the start of the pandemic, and in his 19 January speech he appears to focus on the size of the programme, referring to England’s NHS Test and Trace scheme as “the largest in Europe”. The UK has performed substantially more tests than the largest four other countries in Europe. The latest figures show the UK had done 424.89m tests by 20 January, compared with 223.19m in France, 160m in Italy, about 99m in Germany and 79.8m in Spain. On the world stage, however, the UK lags behind 768m in the US and 709m in India. Proportionally, the UK is now doing 22.07 tests per 1,000 people – fewer than Denmark’s 34, Portugal’s 31 and Greece’s 22.75. And Denmark has performed far more tests per person, relative to population size, since the pandemic began. However, the purpose of testing and tracing is to be able to identify people who are likely to pass the virus on to others, and for them to isolate till they are no longer infectious. Its ultimate intention is to reduce deaths and serious illness. By this measure, the UK has done worse than some countries – there have been about 217 excess deaths per 100,000 here compared with 135 per 100,000 in Germany – but better than others such as the US, which has had about 314 per 100,000.James Tapper Johnson can claim to have “got Brexit done” by having signed a withdrawal agreement on 24 January 2020, making Brexit a legal reality. But disentangling the UK from the EU is far from finished and is proving anything but simple. Foreign secretary Liz Truss is still negotiating with Brussels over the Northern Ireland protocol. Trade between the UK and EU has been hit by new rules and regulations, many of which have been delayed and some of which still have not come into force because of fears of the extra delays they will cause. The UK is still pushing to retain links to key EU projects of economic benefit, such as the Horizon Europe research fund and the Copernicus Earth observation programme, but the EU is no pushover in negotiations with a state that has chosen to leave. Global Britain has not materialised in the way the Brexiters promised. And there is little sign that the Biden administration wants to do a trade deal with the UK that was supposed to be the cherry on the post-single-market cake, so limited new deals with Australia and New Zealand are all Johnson has to show for his efforts so far. What is frustrating even ardent pro-Brexiters is the lack of a Brexit plan. Joël Reland, a researcher for the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank, says: “The government seems to lack a clear idea of what it wants divergence from EU rules to mean. Freedom to remake EU rules has long been a dream of many in the Conservative party, but now that freedom has been won, there appears to be an as yet unreconciled debate over how best to make use of it.”Toby Helm Britain’s economy suffered one of the biggest downturns of any major economy during the pandemic. The first lockdown in 2020 brought a drop in national income, or GDP, of almost 20%. This was the biggest economic contraction in 300 years and can be blamed on Britain’s lack of preparation after a decade of austerity and a feeble initial response to the crisis. In the second half of 2020, Boris Johnson and chancellor Rishi Sunak were quick to boast about a 17.4% quarter-on-quarter increase in GDP while ignoring the extent of the initial slump. In recent weeks, Johnson has argued that the UK remains the fastest-growing economy, but only by focusing on a particular annual figure. A measure of GDP from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021 gives a figure of 6.8% growth for the UK, compared with 4.9% in the US and 3.3% and 2.6% in France and Germany respectively. Following the same selective process Johnson used in 2020, this growth rate measures the strong recovery last summer against the low point during the second and third lockdowns. A comparison of the G7 rankings based on the most recent quarterly figures puts the UK in sixth, above only Japan. The US economy was already 1.4% larger than its pre-pandemic size in the third quarter of 2021, while the UK was 1.5% smaller.Phillip Inman The prime minister recently boasted that employment in Britain stands at record levels. To support his claim he used figures that show the number of payrolled workers increased to 29.5 million, up more than 400,000 on the previous year. Tony Wilson, head of the Institute for Employment Studies thinktank, said it was frustrating to hear Johnson quote selectively from labour market figures, especially when the data was experimental and suffered revisions of 100,000 or more. More importantly, the data ignores a sharp decline in the numbers of the self-employed and those who have quit the labour market. “In all there are now 1.1 million fewer people in the labour force than we would have expected to see based on pre-crisis trends, and older people account for three-fifths of this participation gap,” said Wilson. Unemployment is a good news story. It has fallen to 4.1% – 0.1 percentage points above pre-pandemic levels. Yet this reduction mostly reflects people leaving the labour market. Vacancies remain at a record level of 1.1 million.Phillip Inman",News/Politics,‘We got the big calls right’ said Boris Johnson.

1/30/2022,"Australia “will not hesitate” to ratchet up sanctions against Russia amid growing tensions over the military buildup near Ukraine’s border, a senior federal minister has warned. The finance minister, Simon Birmingham, said the Australian government was staying “in close contact with many allies, with countries across Europe and the United States” and directly with Ukraine to “provide what assistance we can”.  The comments come as a Ukrainian diplomat in Australia accused the Russian ambassador of offering “false” and “strange” arguments for Russia’s troop buildup, as western countries step up their warnings to Moscow against invading Ukraine. The UK has offered to deploy land, air and sea forces to bolster the defence of Nato countries on their northern and eastern borders. The US has also promised to send a small number of troops to eastern European and Nato countries “in the near term”. Birmingham said Australia had been “very clear” that it would not deploy its military if war broke out in the region, but was involved in talks about what other assistance it could provide. He called on Russia “to remove its military buildup along the Ukrainian border, to de-escalate tensions and to engage comprehensively in diplomatic dialogue to avert conflict”. Birmingham noted that Australia already had sanctions in place against Russian figures – first imposed in 2014 and extended in 2015 – and was prepared to expand them. The sanctions list indicates the measures target Putin allies who had publicly supported the deployment of Russian forces to Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea. The existing measures also sanction defence companies linked to the manufacture of the “Buk” surface-to-air missiles used by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, believed responsible for the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 in 2014.

Western countries have voiced increasing concern about Russia’s buildup of more than 100,000 troops near the border with Ukraine but opinions differ on if, or when, Vladimir Putin plans a full-scale military invasion. The Russian president has made a series of security demands including a promise that Ukraine never be admitted to Nato, which the US has rejected. Russia has argued it is Nato that is fuelling the tensions. Volodymyr Shalkivskyi, the chargé d’affaires at Ukraine’s embassy in Canberra, said Ukraine was “grateful to its international partners, including Australia, for the unwavering support of its sovereignty and territorial integrity especially during these challenging times”. “As a sovereign country, Ukraine has every right to choose its foreign policy priorities and join any alliances it finds necessary,” Shalkivskyi said in a statement on Sunday. Russia’s ambassador to Australia, Alexey Pavlovsky, held a press conference in Canberra on Friday to hit back at the defence minister, Peter Dutton, for calling Vladimir Putin an ageing and irrational dictator. Pavlovsky said if that was “the level of analysis informing Australian policy then it is definitely a worrying sign” and argued that some western politicians had been “convinced and hypnotised by their own propaganda”. The Russian ambassador denied the troops were a threat, saying they remained on Russian territory. Pavlovsky instead characterised the buildup as a “a warning to Ukraine not to try any reckless military adventures, not to interpret the support they have from the west as carte blanche to do such crazy things”. The Russian ambassador also argued that the international investigation into the downing of MH17 – an incident that led to the deaths of 298 passengers and crew including 38 Australians – was “hijacked by a politicised agenda”. He cited what the called “discrepancies” in the evidence. But Ukraine’s representative in Australia dismissed those comments. Shalkivskyi said Pavlovsky’s attempts “to question integrity and credibility of the international investigation on MH17 with false narratives is aimed at generating confusion and distracting conversation from the Moscow’s role in this tragedy”. Shalkivskyi said the Russian ambassador “falsely portrays his country as a victim of the western propaganda and the Russian aggressive actions as a forced response to the alleged aggressive intentions of Ukraine and our international partners”. “In fact, this is Russia who violates norms of the international law and threatens its neighbours,” Shalkivskyi said in the statement on Sunday. Shalkivskyi said on Friday the Russian ambassador’s comments were “a game of words”, and any country would feel threatened if more than 100,000 troops were stationed at the border. But Ukraine’s leaders have also played down the idea that a further Russian invasion was imminent and have urged the west not to fuel panic, because of the potential economic damage. On Monday the Australian government encouraged any Australian citizens to leave Ukraine immediately due to the deteriorating security situation, and it has joined with the US and the UK in withdrawing the families of Australian diplomats. Australia is considering supplying extra liquefied natural gas to Europe and the government has said it is willing to help Ukraine to fend off cyber-attacks.",News/Australia news,"Australia ‘will not hesitate’ to upgrade financial sanctions against Russia over Ukraine, finance minister says ",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/30/australia-will-not-hesitate-to-upgrade-financial-sanctions-against-russia-over-ukraine-finance-minister-says
1/30/2022,"Many of us are conducting the bulk of our work virtually. But the sartorial etiquette of Zoom meetings is still tricky. Rocking up as you would if you were taking the bins out feels out of step. But then dressing up – clothes or face – as you would if you were having a real-life meeting doesn’t always translate over the screen. A coral lip balances things out. It immediately elevates an otherwise pedestrian look. It ups the ante of your traditional nude, but it’s not as full wattage as orange or red. And it makes your face look happy. 1.

1/30/2022,"It is not uncommon for people’s fundamental rights to come into conflict. Democracies need legal frameworks and judicial systems that enable these conflicts to be resolved fairly and with civility. In the UK, the Equality Act 2010 provides a robust legal framework that protects people against discrimination and helps balance rights when they are in conflict. It protects people against discrimination based on nine “protected characteristics” – including sex and gender reassignment – and sets out important exceptions that allow for single-sex services, spaces and sports as a proportionate way of achieving a legitimate aim. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is the statutory regulator of the Equality Act. Last week, it told the Scottish government that its proposed reforms to the Gender Recognition Act 2004, which allows trans people to change the way their sex is recorded for legal purposes, should be paused because the consultation on these changes has not adequately taken into account their impact on women’s sex-based rights. The Scottish government is proposing to move to a system whereby people can change their sex for legal purposes through self-declaration, instead of needing a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria.  The EHRC is right that these reforms have implications for sex-based rights that have not been considered. There is not yet enough case law to fully understand how the Equality Act and the Gender Recognition Act intersect, but enabling people to change their legal sex through self-ID could in practice have significant consequences for the threshold at which it is lawful to exclude those who are biologically male from female-only spaces, on sex discrimination and equal pay cases, and on data collection. Both trans rights and women’s sex-based rights should be robustly defended. It should be a source of pride that the UK was one of the first countries to enshrine legal protection against discrimination for trans people in 1999; no such federal protection exists in the US. Trans people can change their sex marker on many official documents, including their passport, without undergoing the legal process to change their sex. Trans people face unacceptable levels of societal prejudice as a result of their gender non-conformity, and waiting lists for trans health services are far too long: these very much need addressing. But because reforming the Gender Recognition Act will affect another protected characteristic, sex, it is critically important that any proposals to reform it in the UK are informed by proper consultation with all those affected. That has not happened in Scotland. Instead, Nicola Sturgeon has simply denied such a conflict exists. Women raising legitimate concerns that opinion polls show are widely shared have been tarnished as “transphobic” by Scottish politicians. This is politicians fomenting rather than diffusing contested debates. It has created a culture where women of the view that biological sex cannot be wholly replaced by gender identity in law – a belief itself protected by equalities legislation – get harassed out of jobs and visited by the police as a result of expressing lawful and legitimate views. Everyone loses: in a world where some people are bullied out of the democratic process of debate and consultation, it is impossible to build social consensus around the balancing of rights of two groups facing significant discrimination. The EHRC’s own 2018 response to the Conservative government’s proposals to introduce self-ID in England and Wales – now dropped – also underplayed their impacts on the Equality Act. In doing so, it failed its statutory duty to protect everyone at risk from discrimination and foster good relations between groups. Now under new leadership, the EHRC’s reassertion of its role as a fair and impartial regulator of the rights of both trans people and women is overdue but welcome.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on the EHRC decision on Scotland’s gender recognition reforms | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/30/observer-view-ehrc-decision-scotland-gender-recognition-reforms
