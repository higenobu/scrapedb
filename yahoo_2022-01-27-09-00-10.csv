1/27/2022,"After a viral TikTok, iPhone users are discovering their device has one more button than they thought — and it can make their lives easier. “You’re using your iPhone wrong,” TikTok creator @ellyawesometech says, if you aren’t utilizing the “secret button” on the back of your phone. The video, which reached 1 million views after one day, reveals an accessibility feature one user said “changed (their) life forever.” The creator highlights the Back Tap feature on the iPhone, which is available for any device running at least iOS 14. That particular update was released in September 2020. It allows users to simply tap the back of their phone near where the Apple logo is, and their phone will do whatever feature they’ve programmed it to do through the settings menu. You can set the Back Tap feature to open the camera, take a screenshot, turn on the flashlight or even control volume up or down. This TikTok creator uses the Back Tap feature to easily Shazam whatever song or audio is playing, meaning your phone will tell you the name of the song. To do this, you must have Shazam and the Shortcuts app downloaded on your phone. Make sure you’ve updated your iPhone to at least iOS 14. Then, go to Settings, scroll to Accessibility, go to Touch, and then at the bottom hit “Back Tap.” You can choose whether you want to enable a two tap or a three tap, or both. Then, choose from the options to pick what the secret button can do for you. After you’ve got your choices locked in, you simply double or triple tap the back of your phone to activate your feature. The discreet button even works with a phone case on the device. Even though this isn’t a new feature, many are claiming this is the first they’ve heard of the time-saving technique. “I see lots of these hack videos and never use them. I immediately went and enabled this,” one user commented. If you get this Apple alert on your phone, call 911 immediately, police urge What is the Locket app?

1/27/2022,"New York Attorney General Letitia James asked a judge to toss Donald Trump's lawsuit against her. Trump wants to end her long-running investigation into the Trump Organization's finances. James said in the filing that Trump is just trying to wriggle out of giving a deposition. New York Attorney General Letitia James asked a federal judge to dismiss former President Donald Trump's lawsuit seeking to halt her investigation into his company's finances, claiming he filed the lawsuit only so that he could wriggle his way out of taking a deposition. Earlier this month, James's office published a separate slate of filings that revealed the scope of their investigation, which began in March 2019. Lawyers in her office are examining whether the Trump Organization broke laws by manipulating property values in order to obtain favorable tax, loan, and insurance rates. They're also working with prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office for a criminal investigation into the same issues. In December, Trump filed his lawsuit against James in a federal court in Albany seeking to stop James's investigation, claiming it was never lawful in the first place. In Wednesday's new filing, lawyers for the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) said Trump just wasn't happy with the subpoena they served him with that month. ""At no point, despite having ample opportunity to do so in the NY Proceeding, did the Trump Organization or Mr. Trump ever challenge the underlying legal basis for the Investigation or OAG's statutory authority to conduct the Investigation,"" lawyers in James's office wrote in a court filing Wednesday. ""Until now – only after Mr. Trump was served with a subpoena."" Trump has had to deal with a number of mounting legal challenges since he left the presidency in January 2021. He has already been forced to sit for a video deposition in a civil lawsuit brought by a group of protesters against the Trump Organization, who alleged the company's security guards roughed them up during a demonstration outside Trump Tower. Another civil lawsuit where a judge ordered his deposition, brought by Summer Zervos, a woman who accused him of sexual misconduct, was dropped before the deadline for Trump sitting for the deposition. James's lawyers pointed out in Wednesday's filing that the Trump Organization had previously cooperated with their investigation, although court papers filed last week indicate they produced only three documents from Trump himself. ""Prior to filing this action, Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization cooperated with the Investigation on various matters as it proceeded, producing many current and former Trump Organization employees and agents for examination under oath, and eventually producing over 900,000 documents, including while under judicial supervision,"" her office's lawyers wrote. ""Indeed, the Trump Organization professed in state court that it had 'fully cooperated' with OAG's investigation through the production of documents and testimony, as well as 'numerous meet-and-confer sessions.'"" The new filing also fights back against the assertion that James somehow violated Trump's First Amendment right to free speech with her investigation, or that it constitutes ""harassment."" ""Even liberally construed, the complaint does not identify which of Mr. Trump's viewpoints have been targeted or are in danger of being suppressed, or for what particular protected speech the Investigation supposedly retaliates against him,"" James's lawyers wrote.

According to the post, the robots would be used for patrolling the base and be capable of notifying the Defense Operations Center of any security concerns. If approved for use, the 144th Wing would be the first California Air National Guard unit to employ the robots.

1/27/2022,"An F-35C stealth fighter crash-landed on the deck of carrier USS Carl Vinson before falling into the South China Sea this week. The US must now salvage the sunken aircraft to make sure that no one else gets their hands on it. Experts say it may take a few weeks to recover the plane. The US Navy is working to recover an F-35C fighter — one of the US military's most advanced jets — that crash-landed on the Navy aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson before falling into the South China Sea earlier this week. The ""landing mishap,"" as the Navy characterized the crash in an official statement, occurred Monday during routine flight operations. The pilot ejected and was recovered by helicopter. Seven sailors were injured in the incident, which is under investigation. The US presently faces the challenge of pulling the wreckage out of the contested waters of the South China Sea to recover US technology, as well as make sure no one else can get their hands on the plane. ""The planning efforts are ongoing for the recovery of the F-35,"" a 7th Fleet spokesman told Insider. Experts say China would almost certainly want to get ahold of the F-35, a highly-capable fifth-generation fighter jet that has taken many years and significant funding to research and develop. ""There's a huge opportunity for the Chinese if they were able to get a copy of an actual F-35 to reverse engineer its features, which they can't do just based on the intelligence gathering they've conducted,"" said Bryan Clark, a former US Navy submarine warfare officer and defense expert at the Hudson Institute. ""Maybe the bigger concern is if they got ahold of an actual F-35, it would help them to figure out how to better counter it,"" he continued. China is actively developing and fielding its own fifth-generation fighters, such as the J-20, to compete with the US. The Navy F-35C has been touted by Lockheed Martin as ""the world's only long-range stealth strike fighter designed and built explicitly for Navy carrier operations."" One of three variants, the F-35C has an extended combat radius and is capable of catapult-assisted take-offs and arrested landings. Although getting their hands on an F-35 would be a major intelligence boon for China, Clark thinks it is unlikely they would risk an altercation with the US trying to get this one, though there is the possibility they might try if the US took too long to salvage the plane. However, the Chinese military is likely to search for the plane and gather as much intelligence as they can, Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center in Hawaii, told CNN. ""China will try to locate and survey it thoroughly using submarines and one of its deep diving submersibles,"" he told the outlet. To recover the sunken F-35, the US will likely search the seafloor with survey vessels before using ROVs — remotely operated vehicles — to attach cables to the aircraft in order for cranes to lift it out of the water. The operation will probably take a few weeks, Clark said, and during that time, the US will be closely monitoring the area. ""The US has had to retrieve airplanes, weapons, and in one case, a Russian submarine off the seafloor – so it's certainly doable,"" Clark said, but the recovery mission may be made more difficult if the plane is not intact or if another country impedes the operations in any way. Clark speculated that there may ""be a bunch of Chinese maritime militia boats in and around you, watching you, getting in the way, maybe harassing you, making it difficult to get the job done."" Retired Marine Corps officer and current senior advisor for the Center for Strategic and International Studies' International Security Program Mark Cancian told the Navy Times that the actual process of raising the plane from the water would be ""relatively easy,"" as the South China Sea is not very deep. Cancian also told the outlet he believes the plane is largely intact because it impacted the carrier deck before falling into the water. ""It sounds like it hit the deck hard and rolled off the edge, it didn't go into the water at speed,"" he told the Navy Times. ""It gets much harder if it's in a thousand pieces. This is one of only about half a dozen F-35 crashes and only the second involving a carrier. The previous carrier incident happened in November 2021, as Insider previously reported. A British pilot operating off the Royal Navy flagship carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth was forced to ditch the plane in the Mediterranean. The wrecked F-35B took about two weeks to find and then another few weeks to pull from the water, the British newspaper The Sun reported. Senior military leaders had reportedly been worried Russia would find the remains if they were not properly recovered. Russia, like China, has also been developing and fielding its own fifth-generation fighters. Officials told the British media outlet after the successful recovery that ""there is no danger or compromise to sensitive equipment on the aircraft.""

1/27/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will supply 5,000 military helmets to Ukraine to help defend against a possible Russian invasion, it said on Wednesday - an offer Kyiv mayor and former world champion boxer Vitali Klitschko dismissed as ""a joke"" that left him ""speechless"". Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht said Berlin, which has faced growing criticism of its refusal to supply arms to Ukraine as other Western countries have done, was responding to a request from the government in Kyiv. ""I received a letter from the Ukrainian embassy, requesting support with military equipment, helmets to be precise,"" she told reporters. ""We will supply Ukraine with 5,000 helmets as a clear signal: We are at your side."" Russia has massed tens of thousands of troops near its border with Ukraine but denies planning to attack its neighbour. Ukraine's ambassador to Berlin Andriy Melnyk said the ""symbolic gesture"" was welcome but inadequate as his country needs equipment for hundreds of thousands of soldiers, of which helmets are not the most urgently needed part. ""We are glad that we can see at least the beginning of a change in thinking,"" he told Reuters. ""However, what we need the most are defensive weapons."" While the United States and Britain have started sending more arms to Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has ruled out sending ""lethal weapons"" for historical reasons. ""This is exactly how we will continue to work in this conflict. We are working towards reaching a peaceful solution to this conflict in the middle of Europe,"" Lambrecht said. At the weekend, the defence minister had said Germany would also supply a field hospital to Ukraine. But Klitschko, a former world heavyweight boxing champion who lived for years in Germany and is now mayor of the Ukrainian capital, was unimpressed with Wednesday's offer. ""The behaviour of the German government leaves me speechless. The defence ministry apparently hasn't realized that we are confronted with perfectly equipped Russian forces that can start another invasion of Ukraine at any time,"" he told Germany's largest tabloid Bild. ""What kind of support will Germany send next?"" he joked. ""Pillows?""
