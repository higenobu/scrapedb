2/25/2022,"Russia has seized control of the Chernobyl nuclear exclusion zone after an intense fight over the area, the Ukrainian government has said. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office, said: ""It is impossible to say the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is safe after a totally pointless attack by the Russians."" ""This is one of the most serious threats in Europe today."" Podolyak gave the update at around 5.30pm UK time, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the area was under attack at 3pm. Zelenskyy said: ""Our defenders are giving their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated."" Earlier, an advisor to Ukraine's interior minister warned if any strikes from the invaders damage the nuclear waste collectors, then ""nuclear dust can be spread over the territory of Ukraine, Belarus and the country of the EU"". The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry echoed Zelenskyy's warning, tweeting that a Russian attack on Ukraine could “cause another ecological disaster.” The exclusion zone sits just across the border from Belarus, and it is understood that troops entered the area through the country, which is closely tied to Russia. The Chernobyl plant is the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster, which took place in 1986 after one of its reactors exploded. The plant sits on the border with Belarus and is directly north of Kyiv. The development comes as the Ukraine faced a bombardment by land, air and sea after Russia launched a full-scale invasion in the early hours of Thursday morning. The attack is the biggest experienced by a European country since World War II. Troops have poured across the borders with Russia and Belarus from the north and east, and landed on the coasts from the Black Sea in the southwest and Azov Sea in the southeast. The UK's ministry of defence confirmed that heavy casualties have been seen on both sides, but cautioned that exact numbers are not clear. Zelenskyy said Ukraine was listening to the sound of a new iron curtain falling as Russian troops advanced across his country.
