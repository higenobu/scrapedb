3/18/2022,"Wigan extended their impressive start to the new Super League season with a fifth victory in six games against a Castleford Tigers side who have now recorded their worst start to a season in a decade. However, they will point to the crucial and controversial sin-binning of Mahe Fonua here as a decisive moment in their latest defeat. Rugby league’s attempts to crack down on late hits have been the biggest talking point thus far in 2022. Fonua became the latest victim when he was shown a yellow card for a tackle on Jai Field that, in any other season, would have barely merited a penalty. In the time he was off the field, Wigan scored 12 unanswered points which helped create a buffer the Tigers could not overturn in the second half despite a gallant fightback. Given the manner of Castleford’s season to date, it was perhaps inevitable that the scoreline at half-time, coupled with the Tigers’ performance during the first half, was a microcosm of what we have seen from them in 2022 thus far. There were moments of promise and arguably occasions where the Tigers enjoyed the greater spells of possession deep into Wigan territory. However, they ultimately trailed at the break after being undone defensively in two crucial moments. They led 2-0 courtesy of an early Gareth O’Brien penalty but within three minutes, Castleford fell behind when Cade Cust’s long pass found Zak Hardaker, who crossed in the corner. Hardaker failed to convert, but he was given a much easier opportunity ten minutes later as Wigan extended their lead. It came via a scintillating break from Jai Field, who accelerated through a gap in the Castleford line before passing to the supporting Liam Farrell. Hardaker converted to make it 10-2 but as half-time approached, Castleford began to press Wigan for a response. On three occasions they forced the hosts into repeat sets and just as it looked as though they would fail to make any of that pressure count, four minutes before the break, they struck. Their first try came as Jake Trueman’s looping pass found Greg Eden unmarked, with the winger showing incredible pace to dive across in the corner. However, when Fonua was sin-binned on the stroke of half-time, it proved critical. In the time he was absent the Warriors scored twice; first Ethan Havard crossed before another incredible Field break from deep led to the fullback racing home unopposed. Liam Farrell then forced his way through shortly after Fonua returned to make it 28-6 and by the hour mark, the game felt over as a contest. But Castleford, to their credit, rallied magnificently. At first, George Griffin’s try appeared to be scant consolation but six minutes later, Jake Trueman’s try narrowed the gap further. Jake Mamo’s acrobatic finish then made it three Castleford tries in ten minutes, and suddenly, Wigan led by just six. However, Wigan regrouped and when Brad Martin was sent off for a high tackle in the final minutes, two penalties from the boot of Hardaker quelled Castleford’s comeback and secured victory for the Warriors.",Sport/Sport,Five-try Wigan fend off late Castleford comeback to win thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/17/wigan-castleford-super-league-match-report-rugby-league
3/18/2022,"Alex Iwobi may rank as one of Everton’s least successful signings of the Farhad Moshiri but even a misfit can have his day. His greatest contribution in a blue shirt came with Everton down to 10 men, the goal drought having stretched back to the first half of February. It was the 99th minute when he exchanged passes with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and slid a shot under Martin Dubravka. He secured just Everton’s third win in 21 league games. Perhaps, in the process, he changed the course of a season. Frank Lampard’s first league game in charge of Everton was at St James’ Park and a defeat formed part of a wider swing between the clubs. Newcastle sacked Steve Bruce when 11 points behind Everton and kicked off here nine ahead of them. It explained why their supporters began in buoyant mood, taunting their hosts with choruses of the name of Rafael Benítez. A man who has managed both clubs is held in far higher esteem on Tyneside than this part of Merseyside. The visitors also came to jeer Jordan Pickford, though those chants had less meaning with coronavirus sidelining the goalkeeper. Asmir Begovic, who lacks his Sunderland connections, deputised and avoided embarrassment when Fabian Schär tried to lob him from 60 yards. Booed off against Wolves on Sunday, Everton had the crowd firmly behind them as they made an up-tempo start. Yet the only early opportunity they mustered was when Ben Godfrey headed straight at Martin Dubravka. With Calvert-Lewin not deemed fit enough to start alongside Richarlison, Lampard had made the unexpected decision to use Anthony Gordon as a No 10 but, seemingly struggling with injury, he was a passenger at times as Newcastle assumed the initiative. Bruno Guimarães offered control as they began to camp in the Everton half. The recalled Michael Keane was required to make a couple of well-judged interventions as he showed more solidity than on his previous outing, in the 5-0 thrashing at Tottenham. Begovic held a header from Chris Wood and tipped away a menacing cross that Emil Krafth delivered. There were hearty cheers when Séamus Coleman outpaced Ryan Fraser to make a crucial challenge, though it is safe to say it was scarcely the fastest race Goodison has ever witnessed. It ensured parity at the break. It was a scoreline that suited Newcastle better. The second half began with some of the strangest goalmouth action seen here as a protestor tied himself to the post. A steward emerged with bolt cutters to cut him away before he was eventually carted out of the ground. It brought a seven-minute delay and a few quips about the miscreant having spent more time in the penalty box than various Everton attackers. Demarai Gray at least got forward to attempt a shot on the turn, though it flew wide while Gordon, who had appeared to run off his injury, looked more lively. At the other end, Krafth took aim from 25 yards, though Begovic gathered his half-volley safely. The goalkeeper then parried a shot from Guimarães, with Wood making a poor attempt to head in the rebound. Both managers sent for the forward they held in reserve. Each proved an impact substitute. Calvert-Lewin’s introduction first allowed Gordon to play on the left and the 21-year-old came close, unleashing a long-range effort that a flying Dubravka tipped over. Allan Saint-Maximin made a difference when he set off on a solo run, Allan halted him with a cynical late challenge. Referee Craig Pawson initially booked the Brazilian. After reviewing the incident, he upgraded the card and dismissed the midfielder. It seemed to end Everton’s chances.",Sport/Football,Ten-man Everton stun Newcastle with Alex Iwobi’s last-gasp winner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/17/everton-newcastle-premier-league-match-report
3/18/2022,"Day two in Barbados was one to savour for the England supporters who have landed on the island seeking sun and fun. First came a destructive and emotional 11th Test century for Ben Stokes, followed by the sight of Matthew Fisher wheeling away in delight after claiming a wicket with just his second ball on debut. Come stumps, as thoughts turned to evening plans, this combination had left the visitors in the ascendancy. England had declared on 507 for nine after tea, a total built on Joe Root’s eight-hour 153 and Stokes plundering 120 from 128 balls, with West Indies then reaching 71 for one after 27 overs of graft. With a huge slab of runs on the board, shadows lengthening on the outfield and a wall of noise from the stands, this was always going to be a tricky period for the hosts. They were facing a refreshed England attack too, with Fisher and Saqib Mahmood straining for their first bowl in international cricket. Mahmood had to wait, a lively four-over burst arriving before stumps, but Fisher was thrown the new ball and delivered an instant return. Bounding in from the Joel Garner End, the 24-year-old saw his first delivery sliced to the boundary by John Campbell, only for its follow-up to be loosely snicked behind. It was a golden moment for the young Yorkshireman as he pointed skywards in memory of his father, Phil, who died 10 years ago. It was also a bright start overall. During five brisk overs Fisher got good carry and nearly claimed a second when Sharmah Brooks edged millimetres short of slip. The No3 will resume on 31 first thing, with his captain, Kraigg Brathwaite, 28 not out. Whether Root’s bowlers can prise out 19 wickets on this benign pitch remains to be seen but the return of Stokes the destroyer is a boon after a rushed and unsuccessful comeback during the Ashes. It followed a four-month break last year to address both a broken finger and his mental health, with the loss of his father, Ged Stokes, the previous December a contributing factor. Ged, the former rugby league international, was his first thought when he dabbed Jayden Seales for a single that turned 99 into 100 after lunch. Dropping the bat and removing his helmet, Stokes looked to the skies and bent the middle finger on his left hand, denoting the digit his father had amputated during his playing days. Having smoked 11 fours and four sixes by this point, it was a rare moment of peace out in the middle. Things had started sedately, in fairness, Root resuming on 119 and England adding 39 runs to their overnight 244 for three in the first hour. You could sense Stokes was bristling, however. Fresh to the crease after the loss of Dan Lawrence the night before, the account was opened with a sumptuous on-driven four past Seales and a couple more carved square off Kemar Roach. When drinks came he was 22 not out from 44 balls and, it transpired, ready to erupt. Chris Gayle is on the island this week, enjoying himself in the party stand, and what followed out in the middle was straight from the Universe Boss playbook. While Root continued his cool accumulation, Stokes went into overdrive, ransacking Veerasammy Permaul and Alzarri Joseph, threatening a rare century inside a session and sending Gayle’s new friends into raptures. Stokes was particularly disdainful of Permaul’s left-arm spin, reverse-sweeping fours and launching three mighty sixes. The second of these sent the ball onto the roof of the Worrell, Weekes and Walcott Stand before trickling into its gutter, forcing a box of replacements to come out and bringing up his half-century from 73 balls. Barely sated, the left-hander then set about vandalising Joseph’s figures, plundering 20 runs off one over with a hat-trick of cracked fours, two leg byes and an outrageous six heaved down the ground. The salvo also took Stokes past 5,000 Test runs, joining an elite club of all-rounders alongside Jacques Kallis, Ian Botham, Kapil Dev, and Garfield Sobers to ally this with 150-plus wickets. One half-chance came when Stokes was on 58 and Joshua da Silva was slow to spot a stumping opportunity. Instead he went into the break 11 runs short of three figures with Root, scarcely able to suppress his smile at the other end, having quietly brought up his 12th score of 150 or more. West Indies had been as powerless to resist Stokes as their Australian equivalents at Headingley three years ago or the South Africans he took for 258 in Cape Town in 2016. This innings most resembled the latter and, after Roach finally winkled out Root lbw on review, it similarly ended with self-destruction, Stokes holing out when attempting a third straight six off Brathwaite. From 373 for four at the demise of Root, England continued the charge. Frisky cameos from Jonny Bairstow (20), Ben Foakes (33) and Chris Woakes (41) helped them pass the 500-mark for the first time since they compiled 578 all out in Chennai 13 months ago to set up a rare away victory in India. Just one win from 15 Tests has come during the intervening period. Nevertheless, through the class of Root, the returning fire of Stokes and Fisher’s bright arrival, the clouds are beginning to part a fraction.",Sport/Sport,Ben Stokes’ England fireworks light up second Test against West Indies,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/17/ben-stokes-england-fireworks-light-up-second-test-against-west-indies
3/18/2022,"Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker and one of the most powerful Democrats in the country, has marked St Patrick’s Day by reading aloud a poem by Bono that encompassed both Irish mythology and the crisis in Ukraine. Pelosi was attending the annual Friends of Ireland lunch in Washington DC on Thursday, when she said she had been sent some verse. “I got this message this morning from Bono,” Pelosi said of U2’s lead singer. She added: “Most of us, always, whether we’re in Ireland, here, wherever it is, Bono has been a very Irish part of our lives.” Pelosi then read out Bono’s poem, which referenced both St Patrick’s banishment of snakes from Ireland and the current situation in Ukraine. Huffington Post transcribed the full poem: Oh, St Patrick he drove out the snakesWith his prayers but that’s not all it takesFor the snake symbolisesAn evil that risesAnd hides in your heart, as it breaks And the evil has risen my friendsFrom the darkness that lives in some menBut in sorrow and fearThat’s when saints can appearTo drive out those old snakes once again And they struggle for us to be freeFrom the psycho in this human familyIreland’s sorrow and painIs now the UkraineAnd St Patrick’s name now Zelenskiy Pelosi also introduced Joe Biden at the luncheon. In a speech the president told the audience of his Irish heritage. “Irish Americans think they’re more Irish than the Irish. And – but that’s kind of how I was raised, like so many Americans of Irish heritage – like other people of other heritage as well,” Biden said. “I was – it was imbued in me to be proud of – proud of my heritage.” Biden was scheduled to have an in-person meeting with Micheál Martin, Ireland’s taoiseach, on Thursday, but Martin tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. Biden said he had a 45-minute Zoom call with Martin instead, adding that he is “looking well” and “feels well”.",News/US news,Nancy Pelosi marks St Patrick’s Day with poem by Bono about Ukraine ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/17/nancy-pelosi-bono-poem-st-patricks-day-ukraine
3/18/2022,"A senior Conservative MP has raised concerns about the lack of checks on wealthy Russians donating money to the party, and expressed disbelief at Boris Johnson nominating the son of a former KGB officer for a peerage. Bernard Jenkin said a “change in attitude” was required to improve transparency around attempts to curry favour with politicians. His warning came in newly released testimony by the Commons standards committee, which held an evidence session with parliament’s director of security, Alison Giles, last month. Jenkin said there was a “problem in political donations” because MPs are only required to declare the name of the benefactor but that the true person or group behind them could remain a mystery. Fresh concerns have been raised about Evgeny Lebedev being given a peerage by Johnson following media reports that said the prime minister overrode intelligence agencies’ security concerns. Johnson dismissed the reports as “simply incorrect” and Lebedev has insisted he is not an “agent of Russia” and claimed to have been subjected to “farcical” Russophobia claims. But Dominic Cummings, a former top adviser in No 10, claimed this week that he was “in the room when the PM was told by Cabinet Office officials that the intelligence services and other parts of the deep state had, let’s say, serious reservations about the PM’s plan”. Revealing his own concerns about the appointment, Jenkin said MPs should work properly to identify the true source of hospitality or donations, rather than just declare the “front organisation” that provided them. According to an official transcript released on Thursday, Jenkin said: “That is far more than the Electoral Commission required, by the way, which is why we end up with all these Russian donors giving money to the Conservative party, and indeed to other parties, because nobody is obliged to say, ‘Who is this guy? What business is he in? Is he, in fact, a crook? You can’t accept money from him.’ “Mind you, he gave a peerage to Lebedev – I can’t believe it. It seems to me that that is part of the change in attitude that is required.” Lebedev, who joined the House of Lords in November 2020 as a crossbencher, said he was “not a security risk to this country, which I love”. Jenkin suggested two lists of countries be drawn up from which MPs could and could not accept hospitality. “The Five Eyes countries are not a risk,” he said, referring to the intelligence alliance of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US. “France – bit of a risk. There are Italy and Germany. When it comes to Russia and China, that is an absolute no-no.” Downing Street was approached for comment. During the session, MPs were warned that all party parliamentary groups (APPGs) – a type of unofficial cross-party organisation focusing on specific causes or countries – were “a very attractively accessible” way for foreign governments to wield power in the UK parliament. Giles said the groups were “relatively unregulated and, crucially, dependant on outside interests for funding and support makes them very easy to engage with”. “Many APPGs will be actively looking for the kind of support that foreign entities and governments would be only too pleased to provide,” she said. “My impression is that current disclosure obligations are relatively superficial … Given how I described how foreign entities tend to operate now, that does not get to the risk, which is at one or two removes from the front person operating. Given how easy it is to set up shell companies and to obfuscate funding sources, I do not think that that goes far enough.” Giles said current declarations about the groups were “relatively superficial” and that she had a “top 10” of APPGs she was interested in. But she added: “There are so many APPGs and they are so unregulated that it would be difficult to make headway even if you had unlimited resource.” The House of Lords appointment commission was encouraged by Labour leader Keir Starmer this week to review Lebedev’s peerage and publish the advice it gave about the appointment to Johnson. But the commission’s chair, Lord Bew, said on Thursday that he had “no role in assessing the propriety of sitting lords” and added: “Although the commission seeks to be as transparent as possible about its criteria and processes, its formal advice to the prime minister is confidential.”",News/Politics,Senior Tory MP warns about lack of checks on wealthy Russian donors,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/17/senior-tory-mp-warns-about-lack-of-checks-on-wealthy-russian-donors
