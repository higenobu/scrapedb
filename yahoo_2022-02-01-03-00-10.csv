2/1/2022,"Former Miss USA Cheslie Kryst wrote a revealing online essay last year ahead of her 30th birthday. She discussed her struggle with time and how she once nearly worked herself ""to death."" Kryst died by suicide in New York City at the age of 30 over the weekend, authorities said. Former Miss USA Cheslie Kryst, who died by suicide in New York City over the weekend, penned a revealing online essay last year ahead of her 30th birthday, in which she discussed her struggle with time, internet trolls, and how she once nearly worked herself ""to death."" ""Each time I say 'I'm turning 30,' I cringe a little,"" Kryst wrote in the Allure essay published on March 4, 2021, and titled, ""A Pageant Queens Reflects on Turning 30."" ""Society has never been kind to those growing old, especially women. (Occasional exceptions are made for some of the rich and a few of the famous),"" wrote Kryst, a Michigan native who won the Miss USA title in 2019. ""Turning 30 feels like a cold reminder that I'm running out of time to matter in society's eyes — and it's infuriating,"" she added. The essay gives a glimpse into Kryst's thoughts less than a year before police say the lawyer and Emmy-nominated TV reporter fatally jumped from the 60-story Manhattan building where she lived. In the essay, which was published just weeks before her 30th birthday on April 28, 2021, Kryst reflected on aging. ""After a year like 2020, you would think we'd learned that growing old is a treasure and maturity is a gift not everyone gets to enjoy."" Kryst wrote. She questioned, ""How do I shake society's unwavering norms when I'm facing the relentless tick of time?"" Kryst described how after she graduated from college, she continued her schooling at North Carolina's Wake Forest University and ""decided I'd earn a law degree and an MBA at the same time."" ""I nearly worked myself to death, literally, until an eight-day stint in a local hospital sparked the development of a new perspective,"" she wrote. Kryst said that from the moment she won Miss USA ""my reign ignited a heightened desire to commit myself to passion, intent, and authenticity."" She spoke of how she looked different from typical ""pageant girls"" who are ""supposed to be model-tall and slender, don bouffant hair, and have a killer walk."" ""But my five-foot-six frame won with six-pack abs, earned after years of competing in Division I Track and Field, and a head of natural curls in a time when generations of Black women have been taught that being 'too Black' would cost them wins in the boardroom and on pageant stages,"" she said. Kryst said her ""challenge of the status quo certainly caught the attention"" of internet ""trolls."" ""I can't tell you how many times I have deleted comments on my social media pages that had vomit emojis and insults telling me I wasn't pretty enough to be Miss USA or that my muscular build was actually a 'man body,'"" she said. ""And that was just my looks. My opinions, on the other hand, were enough to make a traditional pageant fan clutch their pearls."" Kryst wrote that her ""29th birthday felt very emblematic of the season I'm looking forward to entering."" She said she celebrated by ""parading around in a black silk top, matching shorts, and a floor-length robe while scarfing down banana pudding and screening birthday calls."" Kryst said she even wore her crown around her apartment ""knowing I'd have to give it back at the end of my reign as Miss USA."" ""I did what I wanted rather than the expected,"" Kryst wrote at the end of the essay. ""Now, I now enter year 30 searching for joy and purpose on my own terms — and that feels like my own sweet victory.""

2/1/2022,"Former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard attacked President Biden on Monday for making key personnel decisions on the basis of race and gender, citing his selection of Kamala Harris as vice president on the basis of her immutable characteristics and suggesting that the mistake may be replicated with Biden’s nominee to replace Justice Stephen Breyer on the Supreme Court. “Biden chose Harris as his VP because of the color of her skin and sex—not qualification. She’s been a disaster,” Gabbard wrote on Twitter. “Now he promises to choose Supreme Court nominee on the same criteria. Identity politics is destroying our country.” Biden chose Harris as his VP because of the color of her skin and sex—not qualification. She's been a disaster. Now he promises to choose Supreme Court nominee on the same criteria. Identity politics is destroying our country. — Tulsi Gabbard 🌺 (@TulsiGabbard) January 31, 2022 Gabbard made similar comments regarding the Supreme Court nomination process on Saturday. Biden “should not be choosing a Supreme Court justice based on the color of their skin or sex, but rather on their qualifications & commitment to uphold our Constitution & the freedoms guaranteed to all Americans in that document which is the foundation of our nation,” Gabbard wrote on Twitter. Gabbard endorsed Biden in March 2020 after withdrawing from the Democratic presidential primary. Earlier in the primary, Gabbard said she would not seek reelection as a representative of Hawaii. After Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer formally announced on Thursday that he plans to retire, Biden reiterated a campaign pledge to nominate a black woman to the Court. “The person I will nominate will be someone of extraordinary qualifications, character, experience and integrity,” Biden said at a White House press conference. “And that person will be the first black woman ever nominated to the United States supreme court. It’s long overdue in my opinion.” Senator Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) appeared to endorse that pledge in an interview on Sunday, noting the President Ronald Reagan followed through on a promise to nominate the first female Supreme Court justice. “President Reagan said, running for office, that he wanted to put the first female on the court,” Graham told CBS’s Face the Nation. “Whether you like it or not, Joe Biden said, ‘I’m going to pick an African American woman to serve on the Supreme Court.’ I believe there are plenty of qualified African American women, conservative and liberal, that could go onto the court.” President Trump similarly vowed to nominate a woman to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, ultimately deciding on Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

2/1/2022,"Louisiana’s top GOP lawmaker weighed taking legislative action Monday against Gov. John Bel Edwards for “gross misconduct and the highest level of deceit” in his response to the deadly 2019 arrest of Ronald Greene. House Speaker Rep. Clay Schexnayder’s comments followed an Associated Press report that showed the Democratic governor was informed within hours that troopers arresting Greene engaged in a “violent, lengthy struggle,"" yet he stayed silent for two years as state police told a much different story to the victim’s family and in official reports: that Greene died from a crash after a high-speed chase. “This would demonstrate gross misconduct and the highest level of deceit on behalf of the governor and others,” Schexnayder said in a statement. “What happened to Ronald Greene is inexcusable and should never happen to anyone. His family and the citizens of the state deserve to know the truth.” Schexnayder, who said he met over the weekend with the state’s Republican senate president and attorney general, did not elaborate on the options he was considering but noted “we are fully prepared to use the authority granted to us in the constitution of this state.” Edwards’ office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Schexnayder’s statement. His spokesperson has previously declined to say what steps, if any, the governor took immediately after receiving that text about the circumstances of Greene’s arrest, saying “the governor does not direct disciplinary or criminal investigations.” Edwards, who was in the midst of a tight reelection campaign at the time of Greene's death, remained publicly tight-lipped about the contradictory accounts and possible cover-up until last May when the AP obtained and published long-withheld body-camera footage showing what really happened: white troopers jolting Greene with stun guns, punching him in the face and dragging him by his ankle shackles as he pleaded for mercy and wailed, “I’m your brother! I’m scared! I’m scared!” The video prompted Edwards to finally speak out to condemn the troopers, and he later called their actions “criminal.” But the governor, who comes from a long family line of law enforcement officers, also repeated the crash theory and downplayed the actions of the troopers. In one case detailed by the AP, he allegedly argued privately last June against Schexnayder’s proposal for a legislative inquiry into the Greene arrest, telling him there was no need because he “died in a wreck.” The Republican lawmakers are considering action amid an ongoing federal civil rights investigation of the deadly encounter and whether police brass obstructed justice to protect the troopers who arrested Greene. Greene’s mother, Mona Hardin called on Edwards to resign, saying he chose political expedience over justice in a man’s death. “He needs to go,” Hardin told AP. “He was able to stand aside as all this unfolded and just remain mute. That’s shameful. ... I hate that I’ve been lied to.” Louisiana NAACP officials issued a statement calling the AP revelations “deeply disturbing” “The NAACP finds this severely demonstrates a need for our governor to be fully transparent with our great state. We feel that our governor has seemingly missed the mark so far,” the statement said.
