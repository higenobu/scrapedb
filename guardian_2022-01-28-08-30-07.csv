1/28/2022,"The NSW Liberals will meet on Friday night to consider a peace deal hammered out by factional organisers to finalise much delayed preselections of federal candidates, and preserve the careers of at least four MPs. But the deal requires a 90% vote in favour from the party’s 27-strong state executive, and there are threats of legal action and revolts in local branches if promised rank-and-file preselections are again bypassed in favour of picks by the factions.  Much will depend on whether Scott Morrison has convinced his NSW colleagues that the peace deal is in the best interests of the party, trumping grassroots democracy. The prime minister usually doesn’t attend, but his views will be made known. The Warringah rules, championed by the former prime minister Tony Abbott and adopted by the party in 2018 with some changes, gave all party branch members a direct say in who was the candidate, with a balancing 25% of votes for the state executive. The federal election campaign is weeks away. The poll must be held by May, and independents and Labor are out in electorates campaigning. But the NSW Liberal party has been hamstrung because since May 2021 it has been unable to convene a committee to vet candidates to run in the preselections. The blame for the delay has been laid at the feet of federal minister Alex Hawke, the centre right faction convenor who is also the prime minister’s representative on the committee. With just a two-seat margin going into the election, having the best candidate in every electorate is vital for Morrison, and there is evidence of his interest in preselection outcomes. Morrison was certainly in favour of getting a high profile candidate into Warringah, such as the former NSW premiers Mike Baird or Gladys Berejiklian, to take on the independent Zali Steggall. But neither could be convinced. Warringah is one of the seats where there is no candidate. It’s one that may still get a branch vote, but there is really now only one woman left standing: barrister Jane Buncle. All three factions met last Saturday to hammer out a deal. Among the heavyweights present were the NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, and federal MP Trent Zimmerman for the moderates; Hawke for the centre right; Charlie Perrottet, the brother of the NSW premier, and Dallas McInerney, chief executive of Catholic Schools, for the right. The PM was represented by one of his senior staff, Yaron Finkelstein. The deal they arrived at is complicated, but easier to understand if you look at it in terms of objectives. A top priority of the prime minister and the moderates is saving serving lower house MPs. In the seat of Farrer, held by the environment minister, Sussan Ley, there has been an influx of new members in some very small branches. If a democratic process was held she would lose to the right aligned candidate, Christian Ellis. Zimmerman is also not safe in North Sydney, and losing a factional leader would be embarrassing. Hawke has concerns about holding his northern Sydney seat of Mitchell. Under the deal, these three would be endorsed to run again, without facing a ballot, as would the foreign minister, Marise Payne, another key moderate, who is No 1 on the Liberals’ NSW Senate ticket. The thinking goes that incumbents are more likely to hold the seat because they have a profile. Both sides of politics tend to rescue sitting MPs. In this case dumping the factional warriors would cause its own headaches. However, not everyone is being thrown a lifeline. The deal involves the No 3 Senate position ( the Liberals’ second “safe” position because the Nationals get No 2) going to a ballot. Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, from the right, faces a challenge from the Liberal senator who filled a casual vacancy, Jim Molan. Fierravanti-Wells wants all Senate positions to go to a party vote and thinks she can win. But others say Molan is much more popular and that Fierravanti-Wells’ strategy is to cause maximum chaos so she is saved. The other part of the proposed peace settlement involves some seats where there are vacancies. Some where the outcomes are more predictable would go to a party selection: Bennelong, Warringah and Parramatta. Those with messier fights would be filled without a ballot. Morrison would get his preferred candidate, pentacostal preacher Jemima Gleeson, in Dobell. The right would get their pick, Alex Dore, in Hughes. The only problem is Dore doesn’t live in Hughes and hasn’t nominated to replace Craig Kelly, who left the Liberals and is now standing for the United Australia party. The logic in the deal seems to be that the right had Hughes before and should keep it. The two women who have nominated are broadly aligned with the moderates. In the case of Melanie Gibbons, who is the state member for Holsworthy, it would trigger an inconvenient byelection for the premier, Dominic Perrottet, and potentially cost him minority government. That appears to be a bridge too far for all the power brokers. The local branches in the southern seat are furious. The Australian reported that the president of the Hughes federal electoral council, John Riad, had written to the state director, Chris Stone, describing attempts to cancel the seat’s preselection by parachuting in a candidate as unacceptable to branch members. Riad declined to comment. Fierravanti-Wells has mailed thousands of party members, warning that the attempt to split the Senate preselection was in breach of the party’s constitution and that the rules to bring in democracy were being flouted. The Australian also reported that one member of the state executive, Matthew Camenzuli, had written to Stone on Tuesday threatening legal action if preselections did not go ahead. He alleges the failure to carry out preselections and endorsement of candidates was the consequence of Stone pursuing an agenda that is not in the party’s best interests. The state president and party elder Philip Ruddock has backed Stone. “In my opinion, the State Director has always acted in accordance with the Constitution, and the direction of the State Executive,” Ruddock said in a statement. If the deal goes through, the preselections will be sorted and while there will be much unhappiness in some branches, the Liberals will switch into campaign mode instead of fighting themselves. If it doesn’t get accepted, the most likely step is federal intervention in the branch. This is a bit like appointing an administrator to a company or a council, with the federal office taking control and the state executive dissolved. All remaining candidates would be appointed. Many members of the state executive would not want to risk losing their hard-won positions. There have already been threats of legal action should this occur. But no one is prepared to predict the outcome. Friday’s meeting will be a doozy.",News/Australia news,NSW Liberals’ preselection battle: what is at stake and who will win? ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/28/nsw-liberals-preselection-battle-what-is-at-stake-and-who-will-win
1/28/2022,"Support for Jacinda Ardern has dropped to its lowest level since she became New Zealand’s prime minister in 2017, as the country reckons with higher living costs and a Covid-19 outbreak. While Ardern remains New Zealand’s preferred prime minister by a significant margin, her support had dropped four points in the latest 1 News Kantor poll, to 35%. The result is her lowest since just before the 2017 election, when Ardern began her tenure. Her counterparts on the right are still tailing by a significant margin, but new National leader Christopher Luxon had made substantial gains, up 13 points to 17%.  The polling took place in a time of turmoil and change in New Zealand’s Covid response, as the country reckoned with its first cases of Omicron spreading in the community, and on the tail end of a small but persistent Delta outbreak. On Thursday, the country reported 34 new cases of Omicron – but with cases cropping up at weddings, airports, a music festival and at least three cities, officials expect the country to be detecting 1,000 a day in the coming weeks. Ardern told 1 News that the latest results were “still a really strong showing for us as government despite some really hard calls having been made, but calls that have put us in the best possible position to continue to take on this pandemic”. “When I reflect on the last six months, it has been a really hard period for New Zealand and we have had to make some really hard decisions, but those are still decisions I absolutely stand by.” The poll also found many New Zealanders were feeling pessimistic about their economic outlook – 49% thought the economy would get worse, versus 22% better. That metric has undergone a steady decline in economic optimism over the past two years, and comes as an increasing portion of New Zealanders are locked out of a runaway housing market, and facing rising living costs alongside relatively stagnant wages. On Thursday, inflation hit a 30-year high of 5.9%. Support for the Labour party more broadly was holding steady at 40%, down one point. With that result, Labour could still form a government with traditional coalition partners the Greens, who held 9%. The biggest shifts came on the right, where the National party, under new leadership, had clawed back some support from the libertarian-right Act Party, which had flourished while the centre-right floundered. National was up four percentage point to 32%, whereas Act was down three, to 11%.",News/World news,Jacinda Ardern’s poll rating at lowest since becoming New Zealand’s PM,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/jacinda-arderns-poll-rating-at-lowest-since-becoming-new-zealands-pm
1/28/2022,"We’ve all done it. Standing in line for a checkout, a drink, or, worst of all, a bathroom stall. They’re all causes of frustration. It’s worst if you’ve had the (mis)fortune of statistical training – because you know just how much of a difference one toilet stall could make. At least calculating wait time is a good way to distract yourself if you’re busting. The maths explains a little something about the search for workers, too. Even inside a workplace you don’t want every worker to be 100% busy all of the time. It helps to have a buffer for when something comes up or something goes wrong. Hospital and ambulance staff have been (rightly) raising alarms about this for years. The pandemic has proven them right.  It’s the same across the economy. When we reach full employment (probably at an unemployment rate of around 4.5%), the system starts to struggle. That’s part of the reason very few economists will argue for a 0% unemployment rate. A little spare capacity goes a long way. For regional areas with smaller populations, this is a sore topic. Despite what you might think, regions with smaller populations tend to have less slack. If you look at a list of Australian regions, you might be surprised. The highest unemployment rates (as at September 2021) are in capital city areas. In contrast, of the six labour market regions in Australia with less than 100,000 working-aged people, four have unemployment rates under 4.5%. If you had the privilege of regional travel during the summer break, you, like me, likely would’ve seen how Covid has exacerbated the problem. At the start of the pandemic, international and domestic tourism plummeted. Businesses in tourist regions battened down the hatches and hoped to weather the storm. The problem is that tourism accounts for over 20% of employment in some of these regions. With limited outside options and no end in sight, some workers chose to leave the regions in search of more populous pastures. Source: Tourism Research Australia So when the tourists finally started to return, there was nobody there to serve them. Wandering down the main street, two in every three restaurants were closed. The third often had staff so thinly stretched that long waits, reduced menus and shorter hours were par for the course. Omicron has pushed hotels, tourism operators and kitchens out of the frying pan and into the fire. With fewer locals and so many people ill, keeping the doors open must feel like mission impossible. Combined with Covid cancellations, it’s easy to understand why some are forced to close the shutters. Which creates more incentives to leave – and a vicious cycle. Even direct attempts to address labour shortages in regional areas have had limited success. It has been reported that only 453 people took up the offer of $6,000 to move to a regional area and work in harvesting in the last two months of 2021. There is a silver lining. Office workers are now pretty convinced that remote work is not going anywhere any time soon. Freed from the chains of the cubicle, the long-awaited white-collar tree/sea change is happening in earnest. Almost 66,000 people left capital cities for the regions in the three months to March 2021. In net terms, there was an exodus of almost 12,000 – the biggest move to the country recorded since we started collecting this data. Take the Gold Coast. There were 21,000 more 15-to-64-year-olds living in the region in September 2021 than in September 2020. Instead of working in theme parks and cafes, many are working in professional services. In fact, with an influx of 10,400 professional services workers over 2021, the Gold Coast ranks behind only Sydney metropolitan in absolute growth terms. While there’s little evidence, it seems likely many of these people are working for employers that are not based in the Gold Coast. In the short term, these workers may exacerbate local labour shortages, rather than address them. More suits means more demand for coffees, entertainment and, well, suits. Ideally, this is short-term pain for a long-term gain. A well-rounded and diversified economy has a better chance of managing economic disruptions. The increased demand will provide more reliable year-round trade for cafes and restaurants. It provides insulation from the ebb and flow of tourists’ whims. Better revenues and greater certainty means businesses can afford to offer premium wages – and entice more workers to the region. There are legitimate concerns about what a flood of internal migration means for regional economies. It puts pressure on infrastructure, wages and housing prices. However, it may also lift some regions out of the current tourist trap. It’s a much-needed sugar hit to encourage back both workers and businesses. After a long and hard two years, our regions deserve the sweetness.  Jessica Mizrahi is an economic consultant and commentator.

1/28/2022,"Apple reported record sales in the holiday quarter, beating estimates as it benefited from high iPhone demand in China and withstood constraints caused by supply chain disruptions and the Omicron variant. Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, had warned in October that chip shortages were affecting the manufacturing of most Apple products and could lead to over $6bn in lost sales. But on Thursday, the company celebrated a successful quarter in a call with investors.  “Despite the uncertainty of the world, there is one thing of which I am certain: Apple will continue to improve every day and in every way to deliver on the promise of technology at its best,” he said. Reporting its first quarter earnings of 2022, the company said that it made an all-time record revenue of $123.9bn, 11% up from last year and higher than analysts’ average estimate of $118.7bn Executives attributed the strong quarter to the success of its products, reporting record holiday iPhone sales in late 2021. It also launched several new products in the fall, including new models of the Apple Watch, iPad, MacBook Pro computer and AirPods. “The very strong customer response to our recent launch of new products and services drove double-digit growth in revenue and earnings, and helped set an all-time high for our installed base of active devices,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. Although analysts had anticipated a “blockbuster” quarter with record revenues, high expectations were tampered by ongoing supply chain problems. But the successful quarter shows Apple is more resistant than other tech companies to those constraints, said Tom Johnson, chief digital officer at media agency Mindshare Worldwide. “Apple’s cult following will always buy the latest version of its flagship device,” he said. “Chip shortages were never going to hold back its growth long term.” Still, Apple faces setbacks in the form of ongoing Covid-19 concerns. The surge of the Omicron variant forced the company to close down a number of Apple stores as well as corporate offices. Maestri offered forward-looking statements on a call with investors Thursday, indicating that executives do not anticipate Covid-related impacts to worsen in the coming quarter. “We expect to achieve solid year over year revenue growth and set a March quarter revenue record despite significant supply constraints,” he said. Antitrust legislation is also spelling trouble for the company, as CEO Tim Cook continues to aggressively lobby against a number of new antitrust bills. Under one such bill, introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar, competing app stores would be allowed and consumers could choose which stores to use. Currently, Apple dominates the marketplace for how its users download new apps. Cook has argued such changes would turn the app store ecosystem into the “Wild West”, allowing unscrupulous companies to flood users’ phones with malware. Apple’s services sector, which includes the App Store, saw large growth in the last quarter, up 24% from one year ago to $19.5bn. Apple’s successful quarter comes on the heels of a record earnings report from Tesla on Thursday, both indicating the tech sector may be on the mend after a series of weak quarters. Analysts will look to earnings reports from other tech giants including Google parent company Alphabet and Amazon to see if that success will continue. “Apple’s blowout results are just what the tech sector needed to get out of its recent funk,” said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com. “The iPhone giant’s big beat could be the next catalyst to spark a rally in the tech space.” Reuters contributed to this report.",News/Technology,Apple beats estimates with all time record revenue,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/27/apple-earnings-report-january-2022
