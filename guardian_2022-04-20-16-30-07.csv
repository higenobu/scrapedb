4/20/2022,"Peek through the gallery window and you’ll see a holographic alien dancing in space. Venture inside, and an eerie, indeterminate soundtrack plays while the smell of woodsmoke floats through the air. Five VR headsets greet entrants, each offering a different simulation of extraterrestrial life. Put the pair of goggles on and you may find yourself, as I did, surrounded by a shoal of electric-blue pixels that move in concert like a jellyfish. That part left me feeling slightly unsteady, as if my neurons had been massaged. This experience is part of Alienarium 5, a new exhibition by the French artist Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster at the Serpentine Gallery. Installation art that uses technology such as augmented and virtual reality to “immerse” viewers, merging the physical world with digital experience, has become popular in recent years. There have already been immersive exhibitions of David Bowie and Abba, while an immersive Avicii experience has just opened in Sweden with a Prince one due to follow in Chicago later this year. There are so many immersive Van Gogh experiences that the phenomenon has its own Wikipedia page. These projects vary hugely in scope, from elaborate, hi-tech installations to Instagram-friendly projection shows of deceased painters. The loungey, perfumed rooms of Alienarium 5 are a welcome respite from the experience of navigating claustrophobic public spaces in a humid face mask. “The show is mixed reality – it’s both virtual and physical. It involves touch, smell, all kinds of things you couldn’t have in front of a screen,” the Serpentine’s artistic director, Hans Ulrich Obrist, says. After two years of intermittent social isolation, events that invite sensual immersion in the company of others have a renewed appeal. People want “something they can’t experience in front of their computers at home”, Obrist says. Installation artists have long worked with new technologies: Obrist cites Billy Klüver, an electrical engineer at Bell Telephone Laboratories, who collaborated with artists such as Robert Rauschenberg and Yvonne Rainer to make kinetic sculptures and soundscapes. Artists such as James Turrell and Olafur Eliason have made ecstatic, light-filled rooms an institutional fixture. More than one curator I spoke with said Random International’s Rain Room, the feverishly successful installation that was first exhibited at the Barbican in 2012 and allowed people to walk through a downpour without getting wet, helped catapult this form within art institutions. “It was a talking point that became very popular, with long queues, lots of people waiting, and lots of other institutions saying things like ‘we need a rain room’, because they needed to drive audiences”, says Justin McGuirk, a curator at the Design Museum. The Serpentine’s exhibitions are free to the public, but most immersive exhibitions are commercial ventures that charge steep prices. I recently attended a Van Gogh experience staged in a warehouse space in Shoreditch, which promised to “reinvent the concept of museums”. Photographs of the artist’s self-portraits were blown up on to canvases and a crowd of visitors watched brushstrokes of sunflowers being projected on a static vase. The space felt temporary, like a travelling show that would roll out of town by night. Labels relating the artist’s biography seemed to have been run through a translation app, producing weird, schematic sentences. Still, people didn’t seem to mind. “It’s so beautiful”, I heard someone say, staring at a textureless reproduction of Café Terrace at Night. In the final room, visitors sat on the floor and watched as twirling closeups of Van Gogh’s starry night were projected on a tarpaulin. Glissando music played over the speakers. The show seemed to be trying very hard to cultivate a sense of momentousness, but the overall impression was haphazard, as if its creators didn’t want people to look too closely at the details. One board informed us that “Van Gogh is a rock star”, listing the five highest prices his paintings had fetched at auction. FeverUp, the entertainment platform that organised the experience, has a number of similar exhibitions planned in the UK this year, including the Frida and Diego Experience and Klimt: the Immersive Experience. The platform asks internet users to vote on which artworks or artefacts they would like to be immersed in next (a Dalí experience is in the works; so is Titanic: The Exhibition. The company stressed that it wants to “democratise” culture and make art “accessible”. Yet a Saturday ticket to the Van Gogh experience costs £25 (a VIP ticket, which includes a poster and a 12-minute virtual reality show, is around £40). Because immersive installations do not rely on the display of rare objects, they can be reproduced on an almost industrial scale. Theoretically, you could license an art collective’s intellectual property and show it anywhere in the world, a model that has more in common with a tech platform than a museum or gallery. “During the pandemic, the games industry was booming. The art world became very aware of that, and of the role of platforms like Netflix – digital platforms sharing forms of culture and doing so extraordinarily successfully”, says Kay Watson, director of the Serpentine’s Arts Technologies programme. In January 2020, the programme published a report that identified how ticketed experiences bring art closer to the financial model of circuses and theme parks. “For some actors in the art world”, the report’s authors wrote, “this may raise the question of whether [these] are indeed ‘art spaces’.” It’s easy to be scathing about how such events turn art into “content” ready to be captured and shared on social media. The drive behind immersive art is unquestionably financial: its surging popularity coincides with the pressure that many art institutions face to secure funding and diversify audiences, whose expectations have in turn been shaped by the internet. “There’s probably an in-house joke at every museum about the ‘Instagrammable moment’,” one curator tells me. “Sometimes curators plan that moment – as they know visitors are going to be looking for it anyway.” Art galleries and museums have realised that built-in opportunities for “user-generated content” (UGC) can be profitable; as the artist Dena Yago wrote in a 2018 essay, “a company’s marketing plan may include a UGC campaign that broadcasts a call to action, or CTA ... this response is often the creation of more content – the posting of selfies, photos and videos”. Inevitably, the artworks that suit this format are maximalist spectacles with excellent lighting. Among the installations that best exemplify this shift are the Rain Room, Yayoi Kusama’s Infinity Mirrored Room, Pipilotti Rist’s Pixel Forest and “anything at all by James Turrell”, Yago wrote. Some in the art world are optimistic that immersive installations could free their producers from relying on the sale of works to generate an income; instead, artists could charge visitors entry to ticketed experiences, circumventing the traditional art establishment altogether. A Tokyo-based collective of more than 500 artists, designers and technologists, teamLab, is already doing this. Known for its saturated, reactive light installations, teamLab launched a “digital art museum” in partnership with Japanese property developer Mori in 2018 (tickets cost $30). The group has since opened another museum in Shanghai, an immersive art space in a luxury hotel in Macau and exhibitions in Paris, Prague, Barcelona and New York. In 2024, teamLab will launch “the largest museum for digital art in Europe”, in Hamburg. Another organisation pioneering the immersive model is Superblue, founded in 2019 by Marc Glimcher and Mollie Dent-Brocklehurst of London’s Pace Gallery. Superblue has locations in Miami and London and recently opened an installation at the Rockefeller centre in New York. At its cavernous Miami base, housed in a converted warehouse, visitors travel through a mirrored labyrinth by the English set designer Es Devlin, a reactive floral light installation by teamLab, and a purple Ganzfeld by Turrell. “When you’re hosting a show of paintings, there’s one business model – let’s sell the paintings,” Glimcher tells me. “In the music world, you buy a song for 99 cents. In the art world you buy a museum ticket for 25 dollars, and that money doesn’t go to the artist. The question is: can there be a commercial, experiential art world, like there’s a commercial painting and sculpture world?” At Superblue’s recent exhibition in London, Silent Fall, an ethereal forest by the Tokyo artist duo AA Murakami was staged in an outpost of the Royal Academy. On a cloudy Wednesday morning, a queue of people were already lining up outside. The show’s curator, Margot Mottaz, walked me through the darkened space, describing the thinking behind the robotic trees, which produced “chemically complex” bubbles that swelled voluptuously before drifting to the floor and evaporating into smoke. The air was scented with patchouli and fir needles; the light drifted from an amber glow to silvery white. Walking around the room, I saw young children playing with bubbles on the floor. A couple took pictures of each other. People seemed to be having fun. But after I’d touched one of the bubbles and taken a few photos, it struck me that true immersion is the rarest of things; more than spectacle or technology, it requires actively concentrating on what’s in front of you.

4/20/2022,"So there we have it. An unnervingly satisfying and problem-free season for Fulham has culminated just how near enough everybody thought it would, with warm congratulatory messages and celebrations after a leisurely return to the Premier League. In the end it was not quite the serene stroll over the finishing line most envisaged but they were rarely troubled, always well-stocked – they have only failed to find the net in four Championship games this season – and with the procession complete and promotion boxed, the question is whether Fulham will round things off by blitzing their way to a century of goals (they have 98) in the remaining four games and, more pertinently, can they shed their reputation as a yo-yo team on return to the top table? The brutal reality is that Marco Silva’s attention will soon turn, if it has not already, towards becoming at least the 17th best team in the country. This season has been good fun for Fulham. With 40 goals to his name, Aleksandar Mitrovic alone has outscored Barnsley, Peterborough and Hull and Fulham have twice put five, six and seven goals past opponents this season, the seven without reply on both occasions. Mitrovic, who is on course to break Guy Whittingham’s post-war record of 42 second-tier goals, is a shoo-in to take home the Championship player of the year award later this month, but his teammates have kept him fuelled. Harry Wilson, a £12m signing from Liverpool, has been revitalised after loan spells and shone as part of Mitrovic’s supporting cast, alongside Fabio Carvalho and Neeskens Kebano, who is arguably enjoying his best form six years on from signing. The arrival of Neco Williams on loan from Liverpool in February strengthened Fulham’s hand, the versatile Wales full-back, who turned 21 last week and has starred for his country on the left flank, excelling as a marauding right-back. It is no surprise the best squad with the biggest budget has conquered the league and for the third time in five years they will be a top-flight club once more, but credit to Silva (whose right-hand man is the former Fulham favourite Luis Boa Morte) for getting them there with such panache. They have been electrifying at times, more stimulating than the teams promoted under Slavisa Jokanovic and Scott Parker, whose Bournemouth side could yet join them. The galling thing for Fulham is that they already need to replace one of their star performers this summer, with Carvalho poised to join Liverpool at the end of his contract on 1 July. Silva has alluded to the difficulties the club faced in trying to get the Portuguese to extend his stay but Fulham were powerless as soon as the teenager began to take centre stage, scoring nine goals and providing seven assists this season. Carvalho’s former youth team, Balham, from whom he joined Fulham in 2015, also stand to profit. Carvalho has been this season’s Michael Olise, a breakout young player with a wonderful sense of gravity, and the midfielder equally appears ready to take the step up in his stride. But like with Olise, the Football Association faces a challenge getting Carvalho, who was born in Lisbon but grew up in south London and has represented England at Under-18 level, in its grasp. “We have helped him grow as a man, as a player as well and he has responded really well on the pitch,” Silva said. “He has enjoyed his days here.” Hiccups have been few and far between. There was a sticky patch before Christmas – five games without victory – a lapse at home to Blackpool and recent back-to-back defeats for the first time this season kept the champagne on ice on Good Friday. But things never got too hairy, especially with Bournemouth tailing off in their attempt to apply some heat. In the end, it was Nottingham Forest’s late push for the top two that delayed the inevitable. The closest thing to disaster was probably Wilson somehow contriving to score his second goal and what would have surely been a stoppage-time winner in a draw at Barnsley last month, when, a few minutes after scoring a peach, he filed a strong contender for miss of the season, heading wide when unmarked a couple of yards out. Fulham have long been preparing for a top-flight return and Silva will know they need to sharpen up if they are to survive, even if he has been reluctant to elaborate too much on the kind of punch he thinks his team could pack next campaign. Mitrovic has scored 43 goals in 48 matches for club and country this season but the Serbia striker has previously struggled to mirror such form in the top flight – he scored three league goals last season – and relying on him to deliver could prove a dangerous game. The Shakhtar Donetsk winger Manor Solomon, a name once on the lips of Pep Guardiola, is admired and a goalkeeper to rival Marek Rodak and Paulo Gazzaniga has been mooted. The defensive partnership of Tosin Adarabioyo and Tim Ream, who recently celebrated 250 appearances in a Fulham shirt, was exposed last season, and given their last visit to the Premier League proved rather hellish, an air of concern as to how Fulham will fare this time around is understandable. But Silva has already shown he can prevent things turning into a slog. “I came here to do something special,” he said last week. “From the first day that was our aim.”",Sport/Football,Fulham cruise to promotion but must sharpen up for Premier League survival | Ben Fisher,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/fulham-promotion-premier-league-survival-marco-silva
4/20/2022,"“If Liverpool make it to the final of the Champions League they will end up playing every game in every competition they entered this season,” explains Niall Carey. “Has any other team managed this feat before?” This has happened more often than we realised. Let’s start with a heartbreaking example from the north-east. “In the 1996-97 season, Middlesbrough reached (and lost) the final of both the League Cup (after a replay) and the FA Cup and were relegated from the Premier League,” writes Paul Brack, a single tear rolling solemnly down his cheek. “They hadn’t qualified for Europe, so they played every game in every competition they entered.” Boro played 54 games in all: 38 in the league, seven in the FA Cup and nine in the League Cup. Alas, a match Boro originally didn’t play – away to Blackburn in the Premier League – ultimately led to them being relegated. If Liverpool do play every game this season, they will be following in the weary footsteps of their treble-winning team of 2000-01. “Liverpool reached the final of the FA Cup, League Cup and Uefa Cup, winning each competition,” writes Steve Williams. They played 63 times that season: 38 in the Premier League, six each in the FA and League Cups and 13 in the Uefa Cup. From Liverpool to the Lisbon Lions. As Iain Pearson (and others) points out, Celtic won an unprecedented quintuple in 1966-67. They won Division One (34 games), the Scottish Cup (six games, including one replay), the League Cup (10 games), the Glasgow Cup (three) and, most magically of all, the European Cup (nine). That’s 62 games. For the record, they won 51, lost only three and scored a preposterous 196 goals. Celtic have a link of sorts to our next answer – the Porto side that beat them in the fractious Uefa Cup final of 2002-03. “In two consecutive seasons (2002-04), Porto played every game in every competition they entered,” writes Alan Gomes. “These were the José Mourinho years: Porto reached the Portuguese cup final in both seasons, plus the 2003 Uefa Cup and the 2004 Champions League finals. Tired legs weren’t too much of an issue for them: except for one of the domestic cup finals, Porto won all those competitions and the Portuguese league in both years as well.” Mourinho’s team played 54 matches in each season, not including the mind games. “Where and when was the term ‘shithousery’ first used, and do other languages have a word for it?” asks Brian. Before we consider the contemporary phenomenon, we should probably look at how the word from which it is derived – shithouse – became part of the English language. According to our own John Ashdown, who wrote about the S-word during the last World Cup, it can be traced back to Scouse slang used in the 1960s. The Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang has an entry for “shithouse”, with definitions “an extremely unpleasant individual” and “a coward”. It had certainly reached the east Midlands by the 1970s. In Duncan Hamilton’s wonderful book Provided You Don’t Kiss Me, he talks about Brian Clough’s penchant for using the word. “The phone rang. ‘Where are you, shithouse?’ asked Clough. (He used the word ‘shithouse’ as frequently as other people use ‘please’ and ‘thank you’. ‘It’s an affectionate term,’ he’d explain – though he didn’t always use it that way.)” It also appears in most of the Clough stories told by Mark Crossley in his hilarious Undr the Cosh interview. Jack Charlton was equally fond of the phrase. In 1990, during a prescient observation about how the media might ruin Paul Gascoigne, he said “Journalists … they’re all shithouses them anyway.” A couple of years earlier, he said during an interview there was no room for “shithouses” in his Republic of Ireland squad. John Hartson, then at Arsenal, was sent off against Middlesbrough in January 1997 after calling the referee, Mike Reed, “a shithouse”. But the neologism of shithousery only emerged in the 21st century. “The word does not (yet) feature in the Oxford English Dictionary,” writes the lexicographer John Williams, “but taking the ever-excellent Jonathon Green’s Dictionary of Slang as a baseline, we see that his earliest citation is from 2014, with Nicolás Otamendi as the alleged culprit. “As this is a Twitter citation, I looked back further. The first football personality accused of shithousery appears to be Arsène Wenger in 2011, the accusation coming from The Guardian’s own Daniel Harris. However, the very earliest citation I could find (2009) is from another branch of the entertainment industry …” @messingerwoman X-Factor. The proto-Britain/America's Got Talent, which, in itself, is a continuation of the Pop Idol shithousery. It started to become a wider part of the football lexicon in the 2010s, most notably when Crystal Palace “bantered Arsenal off for 90 minutes with shithousery” in August 2014, according to one Gunners fan. Arsenal actually won that game 2-1, so goodness knows what he’d have said had they lost. In last week’s Knowledge we looked at footballers who have been named after politicians. And there are plenty more … “Bismarck got 13 caps for Brazil in what admittedly was not a vintage era, and was in their squad at Italia 90,” writes Pádraig McAuliffe. “He’s named after the 19th century statesman Otto von Bismarck.” Don’t forget Desmond Tutu who plays in goal for the Solomon Islands 🇸🇧 Will Van der Byl points out that the former Wolves and Huddersfield winger, Rajiv van La Parra, is named after the former Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, while Andy Hyans explains that the Southampton and Scotland forward Che Adams is named after Che Guevara. “My mum just really liked the name,” Adams told The Guardian back in 2019. Partick Thistle great Chic Charnley's full name is James Callaghan Charnley. Hammarby, Twente, and Championship Manager legend Kennedy Bakircioglü is named after JFK. And then there’s Sagi Burton, a defender who played for Port Vale and Peterborough United among others. “Osagyefo Lenin Ernesto (Sagi) Burton might have the record as he is named after three,” notes Barry McCarthy. “Osagyefo was a title for Kwame Nkrumah, the first post-independence leader of Ghana. Lenin is the obvious one and Ernesto is Che Guevara’s actual first name.” “Have any players ever used a corner flag to attack an opponent?” enquired Pedro Salinas in 2007. Step forward Canada’s Paul Peschisolido, who flipped a corner flag into an El Salvador player’s face during a World Cup qualifier in 1997, and duly picked up a red card for his troubles. “I was kicked a few times and the referee wasn’t giving anything, while every challenge we made seemed to result in a foul,” he explained afterwards. “I was getting very annoyed and frustrated so I decided to elbow one of their players. It was right in the corner and in fact I elbowed the corner flag into his face.” Martin Keown managed the next best thing in January 2002, chucking a corner flag into the stands during Arsenal’s 1-1 draw at Elland Road. Early in the game Keown conceded a corner; as he got up he grabbed the flag and casually lobbed it behind him into the front rows of fans. Despite uproar from the supporters, the FA eventually decided he had not intended to hit them, and did not enforce any punishment. “Have two teams in the top flight ever played the first of their home-and-away matches against each other as late as May? Villa and Burnley are yet to play each other in the Premier League this season and are scheduled to play on 7 May and 19 May,” notes David Tanner. “Having recently discovered that ex-Southampton player Jo Tessem is still appearing (semi) regularly at the age of 50 for Hythe & Dibden in the Wessex League, are there older ex-pros still plying their trade in the lower leagues?” asks Chris Williams. Bec just asked what happens if 2 different players score a hat-trick in a match, who gets the ball?And has it ever happened? One for @TheKnowledge_GU I think 🤔🧐 “Two questions inspired by the wonderful world of League One,” begins Michael Peters. “Sunderland won three matches in a row by a single goal, and in each case, the winning goal came in the 89th minute or later. Has any team ever had a longer consecutive run of late winners? And in MK Dons’ 3-2 home defeat to Sheffield Wednesday, the first four goals were scored after 10, 20, 30 and 40 minutes, respectively. Can any match boast a longer series with the same interval?” Mail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.",Sport/Football,The Knowledge | Has any club ever played every game in every competition in a season?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/has-any-club-ever-played-every-game-in-every-competition-in-a-season-knowledge
4/20/2022,"Emily St John Mandel’s 2014 breakout novel, Station Eleven, told the story of a global pandemic that originates in the former Soviet Union and decimates life on Earth. A page-turner with an eerie, elegiac quality, it won the Arthur C Clarke award and was widely praised for its fine storytelling and for the unsettling glimpses it gave of our world plausibly unravelling into chaos and the dystopian existence beyond it. Five years after it came out, and with an HBO adaptation in the pipeline, it acquired an aura of creepy prophecy as Covid-19 made us all fluent in the language of pandemics. What made the book’s apparent prescience doubly strange is that one of Mandel’s hallmarks as a writer is noticing the echoes between apparently chance events: the links between distant characters, motifs from art recurring in life, and the historical echoes of long-separated incidents. The coincidence of a book meaningfully anticipating a current predicament could be one of her novelistic devices. An interest in complex patterns animates Mandel’s new novel, Sea of Tranquility, though, as in Station Eleven, the naturalism and specificity of its opening gives little idea of the strangeness to come. The story begins in 1912 as a young British immigrant, Edwin St John St Andrew, is embarking on a new life in Canada. He’s one of the so-called “remittance men” – wastrel sons of upper-class British families who were packed off to the colonies on a private income to keep them out of further trouble. One day, as Edwin wanders in the woods of western Canada, he undergoes a paranormal experience whose meaning he cannot begin to fathom. A few dozen pages on, the scene suddenly shifts and we are plunged into the present. At a concert in New York a composer is playing an old piece of video that seems to show a version of whatever Edwin found in the forest. Now that we’re invested in the mystery, the weirdness can really begin. There are two subsequent interwoven storylines. One unfolds in the 23rd century, where a writer called Olive Llewellyn, who was born and raised on a lunar colony, is visiting Earth on a book tour. The other plot strand takes place 200 years later, when an investigator named after a character in one of Olive Llewellyn’s novels begins to piece together the connections between all these different lives. This summary doesn’t do the book justice, but further exposition would, I think, spoil the novel for readers. Hugely ambitious in scope, yet also intimate and written with a graceful and beguiling fluency, Sea of Tranquility even invokes minor characters from another of Mandel’s previous novels, The Glass Hotel, as it gradually shows how all these incidents and people are part of one vast and fractured world. Sea of Tranquility continues the good work done by Station Eleven in seducing new readers to speculative fiction. In fact, the book uses many more out-and-out science fiction conceits – space travel, sinister scientific institutions – but with a lightness of touch, as though they are intended to be glimpsed out of the corner of an eye that’s focused on the human dramas at the book’s centre. There’s something simultaneously fresh and old-fashioned in the novel’s comfort with omniscient narration, and its relaxed style that can swoop between the history of a lunar colony and the most intimate moments of a human life. It conveys the vertiginous sense of a reality that transcends a single existence and feels simultaneously poignant, celebratory and uncanny. One of the quietest yet most compelling sections concerns Olive’s experiences on her book tour. As she promotes her novel, Marienbad, about a pandemic, a real pandemic is devastating the 23rd-century Earth and its lunar colonies. “I’ve never been interested in autofiction,” Olive tells one of her interviewers. This feels like a wink at the reader. It’s hard not to see Olive as a portrait of the author, catapulted to fame by the unexpected success of her novel, baffled and distressed by the sudden topicality of her research into pandemics, and fretting over the quibbles of impatient readers. “‘I was so confused by your book,’ a woman in Dallas said. ‘There were all these strands, narratively speaking, all these characters, and I felt like I was waiting for them to connect, but they didn’t ultimately … It just ended.’” This sounds like a real – if unfair – criticism of Station Eleven. It also seems to have stung: Mandel goes out of her way to make it not true of Sea of Tranquility, which conscientiously draws together all its threads for an elegant and definitive conclusion. Also on her tour, Olive gives a lecture about post-apocalyptic literature in which she tries to explain humanity’s fascination with the genre. “I think it’s a kind of narcissism,” she says. “We want to believe that we’re uniquely important, that we’re living at the end of history, that now, after all these millennia of false alarms, now is finally the worst that it’s ever been, that finally we have reached the end of the world.” It sounds plausible, but another explanation is offered, one that is both kinder and more profound. Observing a child’s grave, a character notes that to the child’s parents: “It would have felt like the end of the world.” Just as Station Eleven seemed ultimately to be about mortality itself and how art allows us to step outside the immediate confines of our existence, Sea of Tranquility reminds us that humanity’s resting state is crisis. Someone’s world is always ending: that is the keynote of this book. And the echoes and callbacks that give it its shape reflect the ways we make our own lives meaningful.
