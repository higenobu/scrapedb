1/17/2022,"Since the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai volcano erupted on Saturday, Seini Taumoepeau has barely slept. “I would say I’ve had four hours [of sleep each night] at the most,” says Taumoepeau, a Tongan-Australian artist and activist based in Sydney.  Many in the Tongan diaspora community feel the same. Some, like Taumoepeau, have been tuning in to Facebook livestreams from Tongan churches, media outlets and community groups based in Australia, New Zealand and the US. “The first night I tried to force myself to sleep, and I couldn’t, so I tuned in to an online broadcast … Basically it was just a vigil [from New Zealand]. They said: ‘We’re going to pray and play music and wait,’ so everyone was waiting online together through the night.” On Saturday, the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai undersea volcano, 65km north of Tonga’s capital of Nuku’alofa, erupted in what is thought to be the largest volcanic event in 30 years. Satellite photographs showed a huge grey mushroom cloud billowing over the Pacific Ocean and the reverberations of the eruption could be heard in Vanuatu and Fiji. Some people reported mistaking the noise for thunder, or an eruption of their own – much nearer – volcano, and of feeling buildings shake for hours. The blast could be felt as far away as New Zealand, more than 2,000km away. Then came the tsunami. Waves of up to 1.2m washed ashore in Tonga, with videos showing water swirling around buildings, through city streets, crashing into a church full of worshippers. Pictures emerged of the sky turned black in the middle of the day; ash and pebbles rained down on cars while long lines of traffic snaked through Nuku’alofa as people fled the city for higher ground. And then there was silence. The all-important subsea communications cable, which is key to Tonga’s communications network, was apparently damaged and almost all contact cut off. For Australia’s 15,000-strong Tongan-Australian community and the more than 80,000 people who identify as Tongan in New Zealand, the wait for news has been heartbreaking. “We’ve heard nothing at all,” Taumoepeau says in Sydney. Her main concern is her uncle, who is paralysed and in a wheelchair and lives in Nukunuku village on the main island of Tongatapu. “He’s an important person, so we’re lucky in that regard,” she says, referring to Tonga’s strongly hierarchical social system. “He’s chiefly, so there are people strongly obliged to help him, even in a tsunami. So that’s very lucky – that’s a cultural obligation.” Even so, people are worried. “We weren’t able to contact him.” Normally, she hears from him daily. “I’m in contact with him every day via Messenger, not only because he’s a disabled person but also because my parents have already passed, so he’s my parent.” Initial reports coming out of Tonga are hopeful. On Sunday Jacinda Ardern said no reports of casualties had been communicated to her as New Zealand stood by ready to assist its Pacific neighbour. Jenny Salesa, the Labour party MP for Panmure-Ōtāhuhu, in Auckland, said she had been able to speak to a Methodist minister on the Tongan island grouping of Ha’apai on Sunday who reported there had been no casualties on Ha’apai’s main island. When she shared that news on Twitter, it was greeted with emotional replies from people with family in Ha’apai, who have been waiting, desperate for news. Salesa told the Guardian communication and internet lines were still down with the other islands.“Just not knowing is actually really heartbreaking for a lot of our families. It’s good news from Ha’apai that at least the main island has no casualties,” she said. “But we’re still waiting to see the effect of the tsunami on those coastal areas and the main island.“There are thousands of people … that live here and they are still waiting to hear whether their own family members are all right. We’re waiting very patiently and hoping – everything crossed – that not too many lives have been lost or washed out to sea.” Salesa said that from Ha’apai, there were reports of thick ash covering the ground, and concerns that drinking water would be contaminated. Taumoepeau said that without news from people on the ground in Tonga, diasporic Tongans have become the mouthpiece of the crisis, and have had the responsibility of keeping the disaster front of mind for international media, and keeping people anxious for news informed. “I found out and got to work and basically I haven’t stopped since then,” she said. “Given that there’s no communication from the country, the onus is on Tongans in countries where we have access to communication … Some individuals in communities have become news outlets. My Facebook page became the news outlet.” But Taumoepeau knows that the real work – of rebuilding, recovery and supporting family members – is still to come. “I say that I’ve been working non-stop, but really I’m spinning my wheels in my house in Sydney, on my social media feed. None of my plans with any of the Tongans I’m talking to has any effect on anything on the ground. That’s where the frustration is: the futile nature of all this energy being expended.”",News/World news,‘Not knowing is heartbreaking’: sleepless nights among Tongan diaspora after contact with country cut off,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/not-knowing-is-heartbreaking-sleepless-nights-among-tongan-diaspora-after-contact-with-country-cut-off
1/17/2022,"Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, has proposed to Vikki Campion four years after the high-profile relationship between the deputy prime minister and his political staffer was made public. The proposal took place at the Latitude 30 restaurant in Coffs Harbour on Sunday night.  Joyce told Guardian Australia that Campion had said ‘yes’, and they were both “very happy”. He proposed with a Parti Sapphire ring, with the stone from New England. “She is really happy, I am really happy and I guess the boys are happy, but they are just the same, no change there really,” he said. He said that if Campion had said ‘no’, “I would still be at Latitude 30 getting smashed”. He also said his first preference for the proposal had been Noosa, “but everywhere was booked out.” The pair’s relationship, which began while Joyce was still married, was thrust into the public spotlight after Sydney’s Daily Telegraph published a photograph of a heavily pregnant Campion crossing the road in early 2018. The report revealed Campion was pregnant with Joyce’s son Sebastian, who was born in April that year, and effectively confirmed the end of Joyce’s 24-year marriage to his wife, Natalie. Joyce and Campion have since had another son, Thomas, who was born in 2019. Joyce was slammed at the time by the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, for his “shocking error of judgment” that had created a “world of woe” for the women in his life, Joyce was eventually forced to resign to the backbench after a separate sexual harassment allegation was made against him. Joyce said he had resigned even though the allegation was “spurious and defamatory” and an investigation into the complaint by the National party concluded without making any determination due to “due to insufficient evidence”. The outspoken MP remained a backbencher until mid-2021 when he successfully mounted a leadership challenge to Michael McCormack, and returned as party leader and deputy prime minister. Joyce claimed he returned a “better person” after his three years on the backbench, saying “one learns from their mistakes”. At the time the affair was made public, Campion and Joyce complained about the intrusion into the pair’s privacy, but later did a tell-all interview with Channel 7, which was reportedly worth $150,000. The MP for the seat of New England took particular aim at the media for its treatment of Campion, and the paparazzi-style photograph taken of her. “I thought that’s not who we are in Australia,” Joyce said. “That’s not the kind of people we are. I’m the public figure, go after me.” Turnbull also introduced a ban on ministers having sexual relations with their staff following revelations of the affair.",News/Australia news,Barnaby Joyce proposes to Vikki Campion four years after headline-making affair ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/17/barnaby-joyce-proposes-to-vikki-campion-three-years-after-headline-making-affair
1/17/2022,"Australia’s visa cancellation regime has been exposed as “dysfunctional and dangerous” by the Novak Djokovic case, legal experts have said, arguing his expulsion is a “terrible precedent” that could lead to “political and populist” deportations. The Djokovic case has drawn public attention to the so-called “God powers” held by Australian immigration ministers, granting them extraordinarily broad powers to summarily cancel visas.  Migration law experts say the Djokovic case – his visa was cancelled because the government believed he was a “talisman of anti-vaccination sentiment” – demonstrates the laws could be used to exclude a person who has previously expressed political views the government did not agree with. “Deportation of a person because of a purported risk as to how others might perceive them and then act sets a terrible precedent,” Michael Stanton, the president of Liberty Victoria said. “It can and will be used in the future to justify the suppression of legitimate political expression because others might engage in unrest.” “One danger of largely unfettered discretions, or ‘God powers’, is that decision making just becomes political and populist … eroding the integrity of the executive and the rule of law.” Liberty Victoria said thousands of visa cancellations had been summarily made since the Migration Act was amended in 2014, but are often legally defective, and carry severe consequences for those affected, including separation from family, indefinite detention and even forcible return to harm. The organisation said Djokovic was an exceptional case: the world’s number one tennis player had significant institutional support, the resources to mount a strong legal defence, and massive media attention on his case. “Because of the regime’s complexity, the timeframes, a lack of support and advice, and a lack of access to review, we cannot know how many people have been subject to unlawful decisions that they could not challenge. Even when people are able to challenge a decision, there is a clear inequality of arms given the vast resources of the commonwealth.” Greg Barns SC, spokesperson for the Australian Lawyers Alliance, said the government had established, for itself, a “very low bar” for excluding a person from Australia, “troubling in a society supposedly committed to freedom of speech and freedom of thought”. “The federal government’s attitude could see other high-profile visitors to Australia refused entry in an attempt to suppress alternate views. If, for example, a high-profile visitor to Australia expressed negative views about the Australia-US alliance, would the government ban this person because this view may encourage people to protest at Pine Gap? “This government’s obsession with harsh border policies combined with its arbitrary approach to visa cancellation and detention has created a debacle this week but, more importantly, risks setting a very dangerous precedent.” The immigration minister, Alex Hawke, cancelled Djokovic’s visa, arguing that his previously held views expressing scepticism about Covid-19 vaccines could incite “civil unrest”, encouraging others to eschew vaccination or protest publicly. In rejecting Djokovic’s appeal against the cancellation, the full bench of the federal court expressly said its decision did not reflect “the merits or wisdom of the decision” but only whether it was so irrational as to be unlawful. “Our concern is the federal government’s view that it did not have to prove that Mr Djokovic would foster views about vaccination that are contrary to the government, but simply that he may foster those sentiments,” Barns said. “This is a very low bar for excluding a person from Australia particularly in circumstances where the power to review or appeal the decision is so limited.” Djokovic, the defending Australian Open champion, cannot compete at this year’s event: it started Monday morning without him. But he might never play in the tournament – which he has won a record nine times – again. Because his visa was ultimately personally cancelled by the minister under section 133C(3) of Australia’s Migration Act, he has been automatically banned from applying to re-enter the country for three years. There are grounds for this ban to be overturned but they are defined narrowly, as extraordinary circumstances “that affect the interests of Australia or compassionate or compelling circumstances affecting the interests of an Australian citizen”. The home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, confirmed that Djokovic is now subject to a three-year exclusion. “It can be waived in compelling circumstances but that’s not a matter for today or tomorrow, that’s a matter for some time in the future,” Andrews told Sky News. “Anyone who has been excluded from entry to Australia or who had their visa cancelled; it is not going to be an easy or a straightforward process to get any entry into Australia.” The Visa Cancellations Working Group, the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, and the Refugee Advice & Casework Centre have repeatedly argued for an urgent inquiry into Australia’s “dysfunctional and dangerous visa cancellation regime”. Ministerial visa cancellation powers were vastly expanded in 2014 – when the prime minister, Scott Morrison, was immigration minister. “Since then, there has been a huge increase in visa cancellations, including in ‘immigration clearance’ at the airport. The system is now cumbersome, opaque, and alarmingly prone to error and injustice.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Visa cancellations made in “immigration clearance” at the airport – such as Djokovic’s – cannot be reviewed on their merits, they can only be challenged through the courts on narrow legal and procedural grounds. “At the airport, people are given as little as 10 minutes to respond if their visa is being considered for cancellation, often after a long flight or at irregular hours. They are not given access to legal advice or other support. As a result, visa cancellations made under a veil of secrecy remain unchallenged, and visa holders are summarily removed from the country and barred from re-entry.”",Sport/Sport,"Djokovic case exposes ‘dysfunctional and dangerous’ Australian visa rules, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/17/djokovic-case-exposes-dysfunctional-and-dangerous-australian-visa-rules-experts-say
1/17/2022,"An artist has accused Lego of recreating a leather jacket he made for Queer Eye cast-member Antoni Porowski without the artist’s permission, claiming that a toy jacket included in a Lego set based on the Netflix show is a “blatant copy” of his design. James Concannon, whose clothes have been regularly worn by Porowski on the popular program, filed a lawsuit against the Danish toy giant in a Connecticut district court last month. The designer, who is seeking damages, alleges that one of the outfits included in the set for Porowski’s figurine copies “the unique placement, coordination, and arrangement of the individual artistic elements” on the jacket.  In the lawsuit, Concannon alleges that Netflix had consistently asked him for his consent to show his clothes in Queer Eye episodes since 2017, which he gave. Porowski and Concannon later became friends, with Porowski sending Concannon the jacket to create a custom design for him in 2018. The following year, Porowski wore the jacket in an episode in the show’s fourth season. Concannon alleges that Netflix never sought his permission to feature the jacket on the show, but believed it was an oversight. The lawsuit states that Concannon contacted Lego after seeing the toy jacket in the set, which went on sale last year. He claims that a customer service representative offered him the set, which is based on the show’s loft and retails at US$99.99, for his six-year-old son as a form of compensation. However, another company representative later told him that the company did not give away its products for free. Concannon alleges that when his attorney contacted the company, Lego’s lawyers admitted that it had intentionally copied his design but rejected his attempt to send a cease-and-desist, arguing that Concannon’s decision to give the jacket to Porowski meant that Netflix had an “implied license” to do what it wanted with the design, including allowing Lego to recreate it.

1/17/2022,"The brother of a British woman who was swept away from the coast of Tonga by the tsunami on Saturday and is still missing, has told the Guardian he has grave fears for her safety. “What are we, 48 hours later? I don’t think this is going to have a happy ending,” an emotional Nick Eleini said.  So far, no casualties in Tonga – which has a population of just over 100,000 – have been confirmed. Though there are unconfirmed reports that three people were swept away by the waves, and that two have so far been found. The impact of the tsunami, and the resulting ash cloud that has blanketed the islands, is feared to be enormous, with NGOs warning of contaminated drinking water, seawater ruining crops, as well as damage to homes and infrastructure. Eleini, who lives in Sydney, spoke to the Guardian as he was travelling back to the UK to be with his mother, Jennifer. His sister, 50-year-old Angela Glover, was swept away from the beach along with her husband and four or five of the couple’s dogs by a tsunami triggered by a huge volcanic eruption. Glover ran an animal rescue shelter in Tonga. “The tsunami hit around 5.30pm local time, I believe,” said Eleini. “Angela and her husband, James, got washed away. James was able to cling on to a tree for quite a long time, but Angela was unable to do so and was washed away with the dogs, I think four or five dogs. “They were housesitting a house on the west coast of the island [of Tongatapu, Tonga’s main island]. James went back to their proper house on the south coast of the island, but Angela didn’t turn up. James contacted the police and the British embassy there, where he was able to notify us of what happened. Eleini, who was crying as he spoke about his sister, said the search was ongoing. “One of the dogs has been found, but Angela hasn’t been found. “It’s excruciating. I can’t even believe the words are coming out of my mouth, to be honest.” Information out of Tonga has been almost impossible to gather since the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai undersea volcano on Saturday afternoon local time, followed by a tsunami, which saw 1.2-metre waves crash across the islands, swirling around buildings and into homes. The undersea communications cable, which is key to Tonga’s communications network, was apparently damaged and families outside Tonga have been waiting desperately for news, as communications remained down across most of the country. Families in the Tonga diaspora in Australia, New Zealand and the US are already raising funds for recovery efforts and preparing for rebuilding programs. Roughly 20% of Tongans live below the poverty line, and the country’s GDP per capita sits at just above US$5,000. Much of the economy of the country is based on remittances, with Tongans overseas sending money back to the islands. Glover’s husband, James, was able to contact her family in the UK via a satellite phone supplied by the British embassy to inform them of what had happened. The huge undersea volcano eruption, believed to be the biggest in 30 years, could be heard and felt more than 2,000km away. Two people have drowned off a beach in northern Peru after unusually high waves were recorded in some coastal areas after the volcano. The deaths occurred on Saturday on a beach located in the Lambayeque region, Peru’s National Institute of Civil Defence said in a statement. Glover, who was born in Brighton and has a background in marketing and advertising, has been living in Tonga since about 2015. She set up an animal shelter called Tonga Animal Welfare Society to care for and rehouse stray dogs. “She always wanted to travel the south Pacific, and she’s always been drawn to swimming with whales, and Tonga’s one of the places that you can do that,” said Eleini. “She married James in about 2014 and talked him into following her around the Pacific and they settled in Tonga.” James Glover had a tattoo parlour in London before moving to Tonga. He set up the Happy Sailor Tattoo Parlour in Nuku’alofa, the country’s capital. Eleini believes his sister could have been at Ahau, a village on the eastern side of a small spit of land on the west of Tongatapu, when the tsunami hit. “I kind of thought if they were at home, they would’ve been alright, but that’s a very small spit of land, only a few metres above sea level. All I can speculate is that the waves came and washed them away.”",News/World news,‘It’s excruciating’: brother of UK woman swept away in Tonga tsunami waits for news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/its-excruciating-brother-of-uk-woman-swept-away-in-tonga-tsunami-waits-for-news
1/17/2022,"The New South Wales chief health officer has warned deaths from Covid-19 are likely to spike in the coming days, as hospitalisation data shows unvaccinated people with the virus are 13 times more likely to end up in intensive care. Dr Kerry Chant issued the warning on Monday as the state recorded another 17 deaths and 29,504 new Covid cases, following a record week in which 126 people died from the virus in the state.  “Given the broader community transmission of Covid I would like to flag that the number of deaths are likely to be higher over the coming days,” she said. Victoria announced 22,429 new cases of the virus on Monday and six deaths, while Queensland recorded 15,122 and seven deaths. Queensland’s chief health officer Dr John Gerrard said the Gold Coast, which has had a significant number of cases and hospitalisations, is expected to see a peak some time in the next week. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, again urged unvaccinated people to get the jab, saying they needed “to give a damn about someone other than themselves”. Hazzard cited hospitalisation data which showed unvaccinated people were six times more likely to end up in hospital with the Omicron variant, and 13 times more likely to end up in ICU. That figure was backed up by the latest NSW Covid surveillance report, which showed to 1 January the hospitalisation rate was 9.1% among cases aged 12 years and older with no vaccine dose, compared to 1.2% of people who had received two doses. It comes as Sydney respiratory physician and lung specialist Dr Lucy Morgan revealed the strain on frontline health workers amid the surge in cases, saying she had been in a Covid hospital ward until 1am before fronting Monday’s press conference. “About every hour between 1am and 6am, I got another call about another patient sick enough to be admitted to my hospital with Covid illness,” she said. “In the short-term, that’s okay. But in the long-term … this is bad. It’s really hard on us and it’s really hard on the people of NSW. “Because this is leading to some delayed diagnoses, some longer waiting times for everything and a huge burden on our community as we try to keep everything ticking over.” Despite reintroducing some restrictions because of the surging Omicron wave, the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, insisted on Monday that there was no point introducing further curbs. “The only alternative is to go into lockdown,” he said. “We have do deal with the world as it is, not as we want it to be. We’ve said in the past … we were working to a vaccination program of 70%, to be at 95% means we can open up society.” Also on Monday the NSW government announced a package to support festival organisers in the wake of restrictions on major events in the state during the Omicron wave. The NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, announced the $43m in funding for event organisers who had lost money as a result of restrictions, and foreshadowed further support packages would be announced in the coming days as businesses complain that an effective “shadow lockdown” was having a major impact on trade. But that is unlikely to include an extension of close contact exemptions for hospitality workers, Perrottet said.",News/Australia news,NSW warned to expect spike in Covid deaths as hospitalisations rise,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/17/nsw-warned-to-expect-spike-in-covid-deaths-as-hospitalisations-rise
1/17/2022,"New Zealand and Australia have sent planes to assess the damage from a huge undersea volcanic eruption and tsunami that hit the Pacific nation of Tonga on Saturday. The eruption sent a thick blanket of ash into the sky, contaminating water supplies, cutting off communications and initially preventing surveillance flights assessing the extent of damage.  But on Monday, flights from New Zealand and Australia were finally able to depart. Videos shared on social media after Saturday night’s eruption showed people running for higher ground as the metre-high floods hit coastal areas and made their way inland while the sky darkened with ash. A sonic boom could be heard as far away as Alaska. There were still no official reports of injuries or deaths by Sunday evening, with communications limited. Families outside Tonga were waiting desperately for news, as communications remained down across most of the country, nearly 48 hours since the huge undersea volcano eruption, which could be heard and felt more than 2,000km away. Tonga’s cabinet held a crisis meeting on Sunday and was asking for assistance, said the office of Zed Seselja, Australia’s minister for the Pacific. A surveillance flight departed Australia for Tonga on Monday morning to assess damage to critical infrastructure such as roads, ports and powerlines and determine the next phase of the response effort. It was delayed due to the ash cloud blanketing Tonga but eventually took off. Australia's P-8 surveillance flight has departed to Tonga this morning to assess the situation on the ground.Australia stands ready to provide every possible support to the people of Tonga following the devastating tsunami.🇦🇺🇹🇴 pic.twitter.com/cK9A4NFfew A Royal New Zealand Air Force Orion plane also managed to depart from Auckland on Monday to assess initial damage in the area. Aid agencies said thick ash and smoke had prompted authorities to ask people to wear masks and drink bottled water. In a video posted on Facebook, Nightingale Filihia said she was sheltering at her family’s home as volcanic ash and tiny pieces of rock rained down and turned the sky pitch black. “It’s really bad. They told us to stay indoors and cover our doors and windows because it’s dangerous,” she said. “I felt sorry for the people. Everyone just froze when the explosion happened. We rushed home.” Outside the house, people were seen carrying umbrellas for protection. Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, told a news conference on Sunday that contact had not been established with coastal areas beyond the capital, Nuku‘alofa. “Nuku‘alofa is covered in thick plumes of volcanic dust but otherwise conditions are calm and stable,” Ardern said. “We have not yet received news from other coastal areas.” She said the main undersea communications cable was affected, probably due to loss of power. She added that power was being restored in some areas on the islands and local mobile phones were slowly starting to work. The New Zealand high commission in Nuku’alofa said the tsunami had damaged boats, shops and other infrastructure. The International Federation of the Red Cross expressed concerns about Tonga being “cut off from the rest of the world”. “From what little updates we have, the scale of the devastation could be immense, especially for outer lying islands,” said Katie Greenwood, IFRC’s Pacific Head of Delegation. The IFRC was particularly concerned about access to safe and clean drinking water as a result of saltwater inundation caused by the tsunami waves and ash fall from the volcanic eruption, as well as shelter for communities, particularly on the coastline. Dave Snider, the tsunami warning coordinator for the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, said it was very unusual for a volcanic eruption to affect an entire ocean basin, and the spectacle was both “humbling and scary”. The tsunami waves caused damage to boats as far away as New Zealand and Santa Cruz, California, but did not appear to cause any widespread damage. Snider said he anticipated the tsunami situation in the US and elsewhere to continue improving. Tsunami advisories were issued earlier for Japan, Hawaii, Alaska and the US Pacific coast. The US Geological Survey estimated the eruption caused the equivalent of a magnitude 5.8 earthquake. Scientists said tsunamis generated by volcanoes rather than earthquakes were relatively rare. As the tsunami struck on Saturday, a video shot from the roof of a building on the coast showed large waves breaching the coastal wall seconds apart, while a video shot from the New Zealand high commission in Nuku’alofa, where people ran for shelter, showed the downtown area of Patangata had been completely submerged, including the Royal Palace and Tonga’s largest bank. Another video, shot inside a church, showed children crying out as water surrounded the building and waves began lapping against the windows. In a video posted to YouTube after the eruption, Abraham Leilua begins by telling his followers that “it’s not that bad” but within minutes, as the water rises, he says “I have to run for my life” before ending the video. Blake Smith-Tatafi, a Tongan based in Australia, said they were praying and in fear. “If you don’t know, the island of Tonga is flat. This leaves their people with nowhere of realistic safety to evacuate. Villages completely underwater. We haven’t had contact for hours now. This is a crisis.” Pita Taufatofua, a Tongan Olympian based in Australia, said he had not heard from his father or family in Ha‘apai, the lowest-lying islands in Tonga. “Initial reports of damage have been catastrophic and all communications with Tonga have been wiped out,” he said. “Whilst I can’t assist family at this moment I will focus on country as more information comes out.” Southern Cross Cable Network said on Sunday it had been able to confirm contact with a communications centre in Tonga and work was under way to have internet and phone links restored. A tweet on Sunday morning stated that the Tongan prime minister, Siaosi Sovaleni, said the tsunami warning remained in place and much of the country had sustained serious damage. Australia’s foreign affairs department said its high commission had received no reports of casualties. However, there were reports that a UK woman Angela Glover, who ran a tattoo parlour in Nuku’alofa, was missing after being swept away in the tsunami. Social media posts from her family and friends said she had not been heard from since the disaster and they were appealing for news of her. Ardern said the situation in Tonga was “hugely concerning”. “Communication, as a result of the eruption, has been difficult, but our defence force team and Ministry of Foreign Affairs are working as we speak to establish what’s needed and how we can help,” she said. New Zealand has made an initial NZ$500,000 (£249,000) available to Tonga and has dispatched an aerial surveillance aircraft to assess the damage. Ardern said she had been in touch with Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister, and that both governments stood ready to respond to Tonga’s needs. But conditions were not immediately safe for aircraft. “There’s an urgency here. We want to make sure we’re on the ground as soon as possible, but for our navy vessels it will take several days to reach Tonga, and we need to finely balance the need to get there quickly but to make sure we also get the people and resources they need there as well, and in some cases we have parts of Tonga where we just haven’t been able to establish communication.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he was “deeply concerned” about the people of Tonga and that the US stood prepared to provide support. Shairani Ali, the chief executive of Save the Children Fiji, said the charity was closely monitoring the situation and prepared to respond. “Our thoughts have been for the safety of our Tongan brothers and sisters, and Save the Children is well placed to assist as needed,” she said, adding that the “booms from the eruption of the Tonga volcano could be clearly heard in Fiji”. The volcano, Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha‘apai, at 1,800 metres high and 20km (12.5 miles) wide, is 65km (40 miles) north of Nuku‘alofa. US Storm Watch said the eruption was one of the most violent ever captured on satellite, while Tonga’s geological service said the gas, smoke and ash from the eruption reached 20km into the sky. The eruption could be heard 2,300km (1,400km) away in New Zealand, while tsunami warnings were in force at various times across the Pacific, including in Australia, Japan and the US. Some coastal communities in Fiji and Vanuatu were damaged by large waves, while tidal surges were reported to have damaged harbours and coastal parks along the US west coast. Satellite imagery appeared to show Tonga’s uninhabited Nuku and Tau islands completely eroded. Tonga has also been hit by two category five cyclones in the last five years: Cyclone Harold in April 2020 and Cyclone Gita in 2018. In Japan, about 230,000 people were advised to evacuate across eight prefectures as waves of more than a metre hit coastal areas, the public broadcaster NHK reported. The alert included areas hit by the deadly 2011 tsunami.
