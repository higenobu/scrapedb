1/27/2022,"Danielle Collins has reflected on the long journey she has taken to reach her first grand slam final at the age of 28. The American beat Iga Swiatek 6-4, 6-1 at the Australian Open on Thursday to set up a final with home favourite and world No 1 Ash Barty.  “It feels amazing. It has been such a journey. It is so many years of hard work. Yesterday I spoke about all the early mornings my Dad would get up and practise with me before school,” she said. Collins has a 1-3 career record against Barty but won their most recent meeting at the 2021 Adelaide International. “We’ve had some incredible battles over the years. To play the world number one in her home country will be spectacular,” she said. Collins has enjoyed success in Melbourne before, reaching the Australian Open semi-final in 2019. However, she believes she is now a more complete player. “I have added more variety to my game over the last couple of years but this is my Plan A. It was working for me really well today so I just had to stick with it,” she said. The world No 30 has links with Australia: the former Australian rules footballer Tom Couch is her trainer and boyfriend. However, she acknowledged the crowd at Saturday’s final will firmly be in Barty’s camp. “The energy the crowd will bring, whether it’s for me or against me, it will be incredible. I look forward to a great match,” she said. The Floridian has fought health problems to get to this stage. In April she underwent emergency surgery for endometriosis. “It is incredible to be on this stage, especially after all the health challenges. I couldn’t be happier,” she said. Endometriosis, a chronic inflammatory condition that affects one in 10 women globally, can cause debilitating pain. In August, Collins spoke about the toll the condition took on her career. “Had I not had the surgery, I just couldn’t keep living my life like that. The agony that I experienced from my menstrual cycles and from the endometriosis is some of the worst pain I’ve ever had,” she said.",Sport/Sport,USA’s Danielle Collins reflects on long journey to Australian Open final,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/27/danielle-collins-australian-open-final-ash-barty-tennis
1/27/2022,"Police forces in England and Wales have recorded the highest number of rapes and sexual offences over a year, official figures released on Thursday show. There were 63,136 rapes recorded in the year to September, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), up 13% from the previous period (56,119).  This was the highest recorded annual figure to date and included 17,419 offences between July and September – the highest quarterly figure. The highest number of sexual offences was also recorded in the 12 months to September (170,973), a 12% increase compared with 152,620 in the same period the previous year. This is driven by “noticeable increases since April 2021”, the ONS said. Rape accounted for 37% of all sexual offences recorded by police. The ONS said the latest figures may reflect a “number of factors”, including the “impact of high-profile incidents, media coverage and campaigns on people’s willingness to report incidents to the police, as well as a potential increase in the number of victims”, and it urged caution when interpreting the data. The figures cover the months after the kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard in March. She was attacked and killed by a Metropolitan police officer, Wayne Couzens, prompting a national debate about sexual violence, the safety of women and the response from government, police and prosecutors. A statement from the ONS said: “The overall trend is also currently difficult to disentangle from the impact of lockdowns. Offences recorded by the police dropped noticeably during the spring 2020 lockdown before rebounding to previous levels in the July to September 2020 quarter. “The winter 2020 to 2021 lockdowns saw a smaller reduction in the number of sexual offences recorded by the police but a greater level of increase in these offences in the subsequent quarters.”",News/Society,Recorded rapes and sexual offences in England and Wales hit record high,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/27/recorded-rapes-and-sexual-offences-in-england-and-wales-hit-record-high
1/27/2022,"A feat of detective work – and the chance discovery of dozens of well-preserved documents at a wrestling club in Wigan – has unlocked a remarkable secret that rewrites more than 100 years of British Olympic history, the Guardian can reveal. The sprinter Harry Edward, who won two bronze medals at the 1920 Antwerp Games, has long been lauded as Britain’s first black Olympian. But now a team of researchers has found that Edward’s achievement was beaten by 12 years by a long forgotten black heavyweight wrestler named Louis Bruce, who reached the second round of the 1908 Olympics in London.  Bruce, who was born in Edinburgh in December 1875, is already known to transport historians as one of the first black tram drivers in Britain. Last year he was celebrated by the London Transport Museum and appeared on its Black History tube map. Until now, however, his sporting claim to fame has been ignored. However that will change with the British Olympic Association acknowledging the significance of the findings. Scott Field, the BOA’s director of communications, told the Guardian: “This is a fascinating new body of research and we’re excited to learn of Louis Bruce’s story in being the first reported black British Olympian. The diversity of British Olympians is to be celebrated and something we are incredibly proud of.” The discovery also establishes Bruce as the fourth earliest known black athlete to compete at an Olympics. Only Constantin Henriquez, who played rugby for France in 1900, the US hurdler George Poage in 1904, and the American 400m runner John Baxter Taylor Jr, who first raced in 1908 on 21 July, two days before Bruce wrestled in the 73kg catch-as-catch-can wrestling division, competed before him. The seeds of the tale were sown last year when the Canadian researchers Connor Mah and Rob Gilmore, who contribute to the Olympedia.org website, the most comprehensive database about the Olympic Games, began to clean up official athlete records from London 1908. The first hurdle they faced is that many competitors’ full names were not included in the official records. In Bruce’s case there was a further complication as he was erroneously identified in some history books as “Lawrence Bruce”. “A major problem we had is that many official Olympic reports, along with newspaper coverage, rarely used more than a first initial and a surname for the athletes,” said Gilmore, who worked at the Provincial Archives of New Brunswick for nearly 40 years. “This also seemed almost an iron-clad rule in sports journalism at the time, especially with amateur athletics.” However during their research Mah began to wonder if Bruce had been misnamed, and also noticed from census archives that a Louis Bruce was in Hammersmith around the same time as the 1908 London Games. Meanwhile Gilmore found a wrestling advertisement in the newspaper archives a year later for a bout featuring Ernest Nixson and a “Darkey” Bruce, as well as multiple clippings describing him as “coloured” which further piqued their interest. But the breakthrough came when it was suggested to Mah that the SnakePit wrestling club in Wigan had a collection of old wrestling documents and memorabilia, which had been passed from person to person down the years and might be worth exploring. It proved a eureka moment. When Mah contacted the club, he found they had a set of 1908 Olympic wrestling documents, including entry forms and lists, which included the full names and addresses of all 53 British wrestlers in the competition. That allowed him and Gilmore to establish that L Bruce’s first name was Louis, not Lawrence. And, shortly thereafter, that his address, 76 Princes Road in Teddington, was the same as the tram driver Louis Bruce listed in the 1911 UK census. Mah said: “All we knew about him before we started our research was that a ‘Lawrence Bruce’ was affiliated with Hammersmith Amateur Wrestling Club and that he competed in the heavyweight division of the 1908 Olympics, defeating Alfred Banbrook in the first round, but losing his next bout to Ernest Nixson. “Over the few months of digging we were able to make significant progress, but it was the set of documents at the SnakePit club that provided the breakthrough. Especially as they provided the full names of every single competitor, in their original handwriting and the street address of each competitor. “The person there sent photos of all the documents they had via WhatsApp after I vaguely described what I was looking for. I had no idea that they had everything – it was a huge stroke of luck.” That was far from the end of the story. The pair were then helped by the sports historian Andy Mitchell, who discovered further details about Bruce’s extraordinary life – including his birth certificate and a photograph of Bruce on a tram from 1906, confirming beyond doubt that he was black. In the picture Bruce – who got his licence to drive trams in 1900 and was later promoted to inspector, a notable achievement for the time – stands alongside the mayor of Kingston upon Thames, Henry Charles Minnitt, as he ceremonially takes the controls of the first London United Tramways electric tram to cross the Kingston Bridge over the River Thames as a part of a new route to Tolworth and Surbiton. As well as his regular duties, Bruce was the personal driver for the managing director of the company, Sir James Clifton Robinson, who had a private tram at his house for commuting to work. In 2021 the London Transport Museum celebrated Bruce’s achievements, calling him “one of London’s first Black tram drivers” – although they too got his first name wrong, calling him Lewis not Louis. “Unfortunately, little further is known of Lewis’s story,” they wrote. Since then, the researchers have uncovered far more about Bruce’s life, including the fact he frequently performed in entertainment acts as a dancer, ragtime singer and comedian in tramway social events and concerts. During that period he married Ethel Elizabeth Dunn in September 1911, and the couple later had a son, Dennis. He may have worked on the trams as late as 1922, but by the 1930s he owned a newsagent shop in Epsom Road, Sutton. Meanwhile Bruce’s sporting achievements continued after the 1908 Olympics. In January 1913 one report noted that “the well-known coloured boxer” Inspector Bruce, had won the London United Tramways heavyweight title, while a year later he also claimed victory in a one-mile walking handicap race at Griffin Park. The Olympic historian and statistician Hilary Evans, who helped with the research, said that Bruce’s story was highly significant: “In this day and age it’s very unusual to find a motherlode of documents that haven’t been examined by historians.” Bruce died, aged 82, in 1958 with an estate valued at £5,897. However one mystery remains. His birth certificate states that Louis Bruce McAvoy Mortimore Doney was born in Edinburgh to Jane Elizabeth Doney, who is believed to have been white. However his father is not named. Intriguingly, Doney was a widow who had six daughters in Plymouth before giving birth to Bruce in Scotland – yet she was back in the south-west and remarried by the time of the 1881 census. Bruce then grew up in Plympton, Plymouth, with his grandmother and two aunts. On his marriage certificate, Bruce listed his father was a medical practitioner named William King Bruce, but researchers are yet to find him. “The only thing missing, frustratingly, is the identity of his father,” says Mitchell. “That discovery will go some way to explaining why a 33-year-old widow from Plymouth with six daughters ended up having an illegitimate child in Edinburgh.” It all makes for a remarkable tale, which adds to the rich tapestry of British achievements since the modern Games began in 1896. Next month at the Winter Games in Beijing, 50 Team GB athletes will seek to write their own chapters in Olympic history. Now, at last, Bruce’s story is also being heard.",Sport/Sport,History rewritten as wrestler Louis Bruce revealed as Britain’s first black Olympian ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/27/louis-bruce-revealed-as-britains-first-black-olympian
1/27/2022,"From snatching sea lions off beaches to stunning fish with a strike of their tails, orcas are renowned for their highly specialised hunting techniques passed down over generations. Now, for the first time, killer whales have been recorded hunting the planet’s largest animal – the blue whale – in coordinated and brutal attacks. Female-led pods of killer whales, also known as orcas, have been recorded killing and eating blue whales in three separate attacks off the coast of Australia since 2019, according to a paper published in Marine Mammal Science.  Previously there were reports of these apex predators “chasing” blue whales – which grow up to 33 metres long – but authenticated attacks are extremely rare. This research is the first to officially document these killings, including details about how orcas swim inside the mouth of the blue whale to eat its tongue just before it dies. “Here we provide the first documentation of killer whales killing and eating blue whales: two individuals killed, 16 days apart in 2019, and a third in 2021,” researchers wrote in the paper. “Notably, the first whale taken appeared to be a healthy adult.” All the attacks happened off Bremer Bay in Western Australia, within 40 miles (60km) of the shore, and were observed from commercial whale-watching vessels. Many individual females were involved in all three attacks. The attack in March 2019 was on a healthy adult whale, between 18 and 22 metres long. It was coordinated by at least 12 orcas, led by eight adult females and one male, with younger ones watching. By the time observers reached the site, large chunks of skin and blubber had been stripped off the adult blue whale and most of the dorsal fin had been bitten off. After an hour of relentless attacks, three female killer whales lined up side-by-side and rammed the blue whale on its side, pushing it underwater, while two others attacked its head. The last one swam inside its mouth and started eating its tongue, which is nutritionally dense. In the next six hours, 50 more orcas joined in the feeding, as well as at least 200 flesh-footed shearwaters, more than 20 storm petrels and at least one albatross. Several dozen birds continued to feed on scraps for days afterwards. “We visited the kill site for six days after the attack, and for the first few days there was a large slick on the surface where oil was emanating from the carcass on the seafloor,” the researchers wrote. The killer whales were not seen on site again. The next attack a few weeks later was on a blue whale calf between 10 and 12 metres long. It was led by 25 orcas, including 22 females, around 25 miles from the first attack. Towards the end of the attack, an adult female again put her head inside the blue whale’s mouth to feed on its tongue. For the next three and a half hours, about 50 killer whales fed off the carcass, bringing large chunks of flesh to the surface, which were torn apart and fed on by various members of the group. There was no evidence of aggression or frenzied feeding, researchers said. The third attack was on a yearling, about 12 to 14 metres long, which was chased for 25km for 90 minutes. The killing involved the same strategy of lining up and pushing the whale below the surface, while also attacking its mouth. The attack was started by 12 orcas, including six females. At least 50 turned up to feed on the carcass. Killer whale pods are matriarchies, led by the oldest female, and any male offspring are descendants of the matriarch. Previously, it had been assumed that for killer whale attacks on large whales to be successful, adult males need to be involved, but all three of these attacks were led by females, which are about 20% smaller. Females need to feed young and may need to feed more often than males, which possibly makes them more likely to initiate attacks, researchers said. Killer whales are known for hunting down large prey, similar to wolf packs, successfully predating on gray whales, sea lions, dolphins and even great white sharks. This study adds the planet’s largest creature to that list, suggesting the only baleen whale impervious to attack from these apex predators is the adult humpback. Most killer whale populations specialise in a certain type of prey, but killer whales off Bremer Bay have a particularly diverse diet. They have also been observed attacking deep-diving beaked whales, Antarctic minke whales and yearling humpback whales, using similar pack strategies to hunt. Killer whales tend to be opportunists when it comes to feeding on mammals, said one of the authors, Robert Pitman from Oregon State University, so this could be a return to normal as blue whale populations recover after centuries of whaling. “Maybe what we’re starting to see now is how the ocean used to be before we took out most of the large whales … As some of these populations continue to recover, we have a better chance to see how normal marine ecosystems function,” he said. Scientists say these discoveries are important for understanding how killer whales shape marine communities, and also how they may affect blue whale populations recovering from historical whaling. There were estimated to have been 300,000 blue whales before whaling and now there may be 15,000 to 20,000, with numbers believed to be increasing. Erich Hoyt, a research fellow at Whale and Dolphin Conservation, said the “excellent” paper confirmed what was known about killer whales and how they attacked, including going for the tongue, which has been recorded on other whale species. “But the excellent photographs in the paper and the extraordinary detail provided by the scientists give us a real insight into how it happens. “This paper is the first to really confirm a blue whale kill and at the same time it provides firm confirmation that killer whales will even go after mature healthy blue whales,” he said. The orca behaviour of feeding on large whales has been found in other parts of the world such as the north Pacific but it is not common, and most killer whale pods would not see large whales as food, said Hoyt. “These particular orcas off South Australia subsist on an unusually diverse diet,” he said. “This is strange because elsewhere in the world, killer whales are fussy eaters and tend to learn from their pod how to catch food, and what is food, and they stay with that, whether it’s salmon around Vancouver Island or sea lion pups at Punta Norte in southern Argentina.” Dr Peter Richardson, head of ocean recovery at the Marine Conservation Society UK, said: “This fascinating paper expands our knowledge of the prey species of orca. However, the small sample size limits the insights we can take. This behaviour has perhaps been going on for centuries out in the open ocean where it’s difficult to study.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,Orcas recorded killing and feeding on blue whales in brutal attacks,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/27/new-footage-reveals-killer-whales-hunting-and-feeding-on-blue-whales-in-brutal-attacks-aoe
1/27/2022,"Afew months ahead of bringing “Rooster” Byron’s band of outsiders back to the stage in a revival of Jez Butterworth’s Jerusalem, Mark Rylance breathes life into a very different kind of anti-establishment figure: Dr Ignaz Semmelweis, a pioneer too ahead of his own time. Based on an original idea by Rylance and written with Stephen Brown, this play explores the life of the Hungarian doctor who worked in 19th-century Vienna’s maternity wards. Semmelweis’s groundbreaking practices in antiseptic procedure saved thousands of lives – particularly those of impoverished mothers – and might have saved more had his findings been recognised by the medical community. But he was doubted and disbelieved, and died in an asylum without due recognition and, in a final twist of bad fate, of sepsis, from which he had battled to save his patients.  His story becomes a tragedy of almost Shakespearean proportions in the hands of Rylance, who appears plaintive, hollow-eyed, by turns diffident and absolute in his unbending sense of right. But the cast around him keep up, from Thalissa Teixeira as his wife Maria to, as Semmelweis’s medical allies, Jackie Clune, Sandy Grierson, Felix Hayes and Enyi Okoronkwo among others, each as good as the next. Under the direction of Tom Morris, the production is almost as much a dance as it is a play, with expressionist movement (choreography by Antonia Franceschi) and music (by Adrian Sutton) that take us inside Semmelweis’s mind, from his bursts of anger to his final unravelling. A chorus of ghostly dancers – the women he has been unable to save – enact anguish while violins and the cello weep. These elements together run the risk of an overwrought atmosphere but the production steers clear of that. Instead there is intensity, and the drama feels drawn out in its pain. It paints a picture of a thwarted life but also, more obliquely, explores why some people are lauded as pioneers, their theories welcomed and their genius immortalised, while others are cast as outsiders. Semmelweis made breakthroughs long before Joseph Lister and Louis Pasteur’s work in germ theory. But in his exacting nature, his single-minded zeal to save lives and his gruff manner, he reveals medical science to be governed by – of course – its own politics of personality when it comes to toppling old paradigms for new. Two time frames are navigated with magnificent fluidity on Ti Green’s set (spare yet dramatic, an oculus above, a revolve below and an almost eerie blackness from which characters emerge). In these switches of time, we get a keen sense of Semmelweis’s inner fracturing: he seems involuntarily pulled into the past, which is enacted on stage, with his present world simultaneously observing it. Richard Howell’s lighting works within this duality – warm and sepia-tinted in the domestic present but a starkly spotlit past which throngs with shadows in the backdrop. Death is all around the maternity ward at which Semmelweis works and every loss has an emotional impact, even when it happens in passing. Meanwhile there is a visceral edge to the scenes of autopsies and childbirths, which are gestured in dance or mimed. Although this is its own specific story, and emphatically a period piece, there is a relevance to the themes of new science and distrust that chimes in our Covid era. The play was conceived before the pandemic but Semmelweis’s pleas for fellow doctors to “wash your hands” makes it feel, uncannily, as if the past is haunting our present too.

1/27/2022,"Joe Pera is strolling through New York, patiently enduring the sort of technical calamities that cause interviewers to wake up in a cold sweat. I apologise and apologise again, but he is unfazed. “It’s OK,” he reassures me in his familiar soft, halting voice. “I’m looking at a beautiful sunset.” It’s a perfect response. Since his first Adult Swim special Joe Pera Talks You to Sleep in 2016, Pera has been carefully crafting a comedy unlike anything else. His series Joe Pera Talks With You – which is just about to return for a third season on All 4 – is a thing of hushed, burnished wonder. Pera, playing a fictionalised version of himself, leads the viewer through some of his favourite subjects; they’re mundane on the surface, but presented with an air of awestruck quiet. There is an episode called Joe Pera Takes You on a Fall Drive, and another called Joe Pera Watches Internet Videos With You. The second season, which broadcast just before the pandemic struck, contained an extended arc about growing and maintaining a bean arch.  A show like this, where a New York comedian indulges in smalltown life, always has the potential for the comic to engage in snobbery. But what’s incredible about Joe Pera Talks to You is that it never loses sight of the dignity of its subjects, and this is down to Pera himself. His commitment to the character is total, to the extent that when you Google him, one of the first questions you’ll find is “What is Joe Pera like in real life?”. It’s a hard one to answer. Pera is protective of his persona, not revealing his age (although Wikipedia puts him at 33) or much about his personal life. Speaking to him, you sense that the television version of Joe Pera is merely an extension, rather than a total invention, of the real Joe Pera. His careful and polite cadences are exactly the same and, in a recent podcast interview, the writer Jo Firestone – who plays Pera’s doomsday prepper love interest – suggested that episodes are often borne from Pera’s real-life obsessions. So where’s the line between character and performer? “I didn’t want to make a show about another comedian doing standup in New York,” he explains. “There’s already Seinfeld and a million other shows for that. I thought about the guys I went to school with, who went on to become music teachers, and thought I could have become that as well. So I followed that line of, ‘What if I had done that instead?’. I don’t know, I think there ought to be more shows about middle-school choir teachers.” But what if you did make a series about you as a New York comedian, I ask. Would the character on that show be wildly different to the one we watch now? Pera laughs – a chuckle, then three seconds of silence, then another chuckle, then another three seconds of silence, then another chuckle – before slowly wrapping himself in knots. “I don’t know,” he shrugs. “I think I’ve met some wonderful people doing comedy, and I also think there are a lot of people at open mics who are real characters that deserve a show of their own. I don’t think it’s been fully treated properly.” He then goes on a long, careful tangent about a documentary he once watched. Eventually, crisis averted, the question is so far in the distance that we can proceed down a new avenue. I was sent three episodes of the new season to watch and, with the exception of Joe Pera Sits With You – an episode about buying a chair so beautiful it almost brought me to tears – Pera himself is a peripheral figure. One episode centres on Mike Melsky, a troubled character played by I Think You Should Leave’s Connor O’Malley; the other involves Pera listening to his girlfriend tell a drunk story. Is he deliberately sidelining himself? “Yeah,” replies Pera. “Maybe it’s me getting bored with myself, but also I think even in the small town where it’s set, there are so many other people to explore. I’m fascinated with other types of humour, and different characters, and different viewpoints, and wanting to grow the show in that way.” The new series is very slightly darker than before, too. At one point, a character is very careful to announce that it is still 2018 and everything is great, and later Firestone’s character begins to mutter darkly about unseen terrors looming on the horizon. Joe Pera Talks With You is such a sweet show, and you end up feeling protective of the characters, to the point that the thought of anything bad happening to them is too much to bear. I ask Pera, more out of concern than curiosity, whether the season will end in disaster. “I don’t know,” he demurs. “I don’t want to spoil anything.” The newfound world-building also hints at a slight change in Pera’s sensibility. “I don’t know about you, but in the past year, I’ve been wanting to watch TV and movies that are a little bit less dry,” he says of his burgeoning love of broader comedy. “Found a lot of pleasure in Dumb and Dumber.” Here I have to disagree, because Joe Pera Talks With You was the perfect lockdown show. It’s so small and shy and full of decency that it’s incredibly easy to wrap yourself up in it. When things are bad, it acts as a forcefield against the real world. This is, in part, down to Ryan Dann’s soundtrack. “It’s the soul of the show,” says Pera. “Ryan inspires me to write better stuff to match his music” – but it’s equally due to the soothing presence of Pera himself. I quote another review to him, describing the show as “comedy ASMR”. “I appreciate that,” Pera says, sounding as close to frustrated as he will get, which is still barely frustrated at all, “but ASMR is about something else. I feel it’s about relaxation and being cozy. I don’t ever want to forget, as a standup comedian who has to keep a live audience in mind, I never want the jokes to be anything less than sharp. It’s easy to do comfortable nowadays. Just play some good music and show some nice images. But it’s also a comedy show, and I take that very seriously.” He also seems to take crafts very seriously. The comedian recently made a video with Townsends, an 18th-century revival YouTube channel where you can learn how to dye fabric according to old American techniques or make an inkwell with clay. Like Joe Pera, the channel is slow and tactile and earnest. Pera’s video, in which he creates a three-legged stool using old iron instruments, is essentially a bonus episode of Joe Pera Talks With You. I’m impressed with how adept he is at woodwork, so I ask if he had any prior furniture-making experience, but for some reason this causes him to clam up. “I don’t want to spoil the end of the season,”, he stammers. “But yeah, I know how to make a chair.” Perhaps Pera is right to be so protective of himself. Part of the reason why people feel so attached to him and his work is that his fanbase largely grows through word of mouth. People tend to discover him because a likeminded friend has recommended him, and they in turn pass his work on to their friends. As a result, he still feels like a discovery. When people fall for Pera, they fall hard. “People watched the last season of my show and they started sending me photographs of bean arches that they built,” he reveals, sounding genuinely amazed. “That was the best thing that could have happened. And the best real world response to any kind of art is to have people build bean arches and get the experience of how fun that is. And it’s growing your own beans. If you do that, you do anything.” As the conversation wraps up, long after our agreed cutoff point, I apologise again and wish Pera a good evening. “You too,” he says, “Although it’s getting late where you are, probably.” It’s 10pm, I tell him. As soon as this call is over, I’m going to bed. “Perfect,” he replies with a warm, familiar chuckle. “I think my main audience is people who go to bed at 10pm.”  Joe Pera Talks With You returns to All 4 on 28 January.",Arts/Television & radio,‘So beautiful it almost brought me to tears’: the comedy and wonder of Joe Pera,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/27/so-beautiful-it-almost-brought-me-to-tears-the-comedy-and-wonder-of-joe-pera
1/27/2022,"A long-awaited report on the extent of Covid rule-breaking at parties in Downing Street and across government was expected to be published this week. Boris Johnson’s premiership could hang on its findings; Tory MPs have said they want to see what evidence of wrongdoing is dug up by Sue Gray – a senior civil servant known as a ruthless Whitehall enforcer – before deciding whether to call for him to quit.  But despite speculation reaching fever pitch on Tuesday that the report would be released imminently, its contents remain shrouded in mystery. Government sources have indicated Gray has finished the report, but pushed back on the suggestion there has been a “delay” because, they say, there was no previously announced date for its publication. Undoubtedly, the handling of the report’s release has been thrown into chaos by the announcement – also on Tuesday – that Scotland Yard was opening its own investigation into the party allegations. It would make sense to assume that the timing is not coincidental; Gray is unlikely to have shared her findings with the Metropolitan police unless she was nearing the end of her own investigation. Because Gray is working with the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics team, No 10 has been unable to provide any updates on the report’s status besides confirming it has not yet been sent the final version. Little is known about why there seems to be so much wrangling over the report, but it is thought that lawyers and human resources officials are inspecting its contents and deciding what can and cannot be published. If there is a risk of prejudicing the Met’s own investigation, then it is possible parts of Gray’s report may have to be redacted or held back. However, that would probably prompt accusations of a cover-up. The Met has reportedly been briefing that it is not asking for Gray’s report to be held back. Unions are also apparently pushing for junior civil servants to have their names redacted before the document is released. A former No 10 adviser, who has been involved in publishing similar reports, said that when such sought-after documents are officially submitted to No 10 it is very difficult to avoid leaks. “Informally agreeing when it is sent is best practice,” they said, noting that “as close to the weekend as possible is always a good idea” for decreasing the level of attention paid to the report. Johnson’s spokesperson has committed to publishing the “findings” of Gray’s report. This has prompted concern that only the conclusions will be made public rather than the full report. However, No 10 has said this is because they do not know what format Gray’s report will take, and are adamant “it remains our intention to publish it as received”. Gray expects that when her final version is delivered to Downing Street it will be published within a matter of hours. Johnson has previously promised to place a copy in the House of Commons library for all MPs to see, and to answer questions in parliament at the earliest opportunity. But even if the report is published this week, the chance of it getting much scrutiny by MPs is diminishing. Most MPs are back home in their constituencies, and the Commons is not due to sit this Friday, which means Johnson may not have to face questions in parliament until next week. When the report is finally released, MPs will pore over it closely; dozens have said they will consider submitting a letter expressing no confidence in Johnson if there is any evidence he misled the Commons, or if there is evidence of criminality. MPs could also decide that even if Johnson is found not to have done anything wrong, the political pain of a prime minister not being able to control the office where workers broke the very Covid rules they wrote is enough to push Johnson out. What would happen in a vote of no confidence – triggered if 54 Tory MPs submit letters calling for one – is even less certain. Some ministers could vote against him, but Johnson’s supporters have been running a shadow whipping operation to prepare for such an eventuality and are confident he would convincingly win such a ballot. It is also possible the pressure on Johnson recedes. His allies are known to be planning to give assurances he will overhaul his Downing Street team and other key parts of the government machine. That may be enough to win MPs over, and let Johnson escape a vote of no confidence through the eye of a needle.",News/Politics,Why is Sue Gray report on No 10 parties taking so long?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/27/why-sue-gray-report-boris-johnson-no-10-parties-taking-so-long
1/27/2022,"A Scottish court has ruled that a soldier raped a woman he met in a Dundee nightclub, after she sued him in a landmark civil action which she says proves that “justice will always be done, no matter how long and bitter the journey”. In what is only the second ruling of its kind in recent Scottish legal history, a sheriff in Edinburgh found that Sean Diamond, 28, a serving soldier in the British army, raped the woman after she fell asleep fully clothed on a friend’s sofa on 14 July 2015. She was awarded damages of £119,250.  Diamond, who was then stationed at Leuchars, was prosecuted for rape in October 2017 but a high court jury found the charges against him not proven, a controversial Scottish verdict which acquits an accused person but stops short of finding them not guilty. Speaking to the Guardian as the judgment was made public, Ms AB said: “The last six and a half years have been so emotionally wrenching and it felt like it was never going to end. The fact that I can now read a judgment saying ‘yes, he raped you’, in black and white and from the facts, is a closure that I never thought I would ever feel.” In his judgment, Sheriff KJ Campbell QC praised the “quality and consistency” of Ms AB’s testimony, adding that “the consistent evidence” of her distress immediately after the attack was “difficult to reconcile with the defender’s account of consensual sexual activity”. He said he was satisfied on the balance of probabilities – a lower standard of proof than required at a criminal court – that the defender raped the pursuer. Ms AB was on a night out with a female friend when she met Diamond. The pair danced together and kissed before returning to the friend’s flat, along with Diamond’s male friend, between 2.30am and 3am. The judgment found that their friends went to bed together, leaving Ms AB and Diamond in the sitting room. She fell sleep on the sofa but woke around half an hour later, on her front, being raped by Diamond. She was prevented from getting up and although she told Diamond to stop and get off her he did not. Ms AB then lost consciousness and when she regained it, shortly after, had pain in her vagina and anus. In a state of extreme distress Ms AB woke up her friend, who told the men to leave and immediately called the police. Her experience of the criminal trial was devastating: “The way you’re treated is literally like you’ve committed a crime.” She was “infuriated” by the not proven verdict and that “the jury were told to think about the impact their verdict would have on his military career”. Then a family friend suggested the civil alternative. At the outset of those proceedings, in 2018, a finding was made for Ms AB because Diamond did not defend the action, but he subsequently applied to have the decree recalled, claiming he had not understood the consequences of not responding. After a number of delays, some relating to the pandemic, the hearing finally took place last September. During the civil case, Ms AB – who attempted suicide a year after the assault and has since been diagnosed with PTSD – moved to Morocco, where she now works and where she met her husband, who she describes as her “guardian angel”. Sexual violence campaigners believe the availability of not proven – which leaves the accused innocent in the eyes of the law – impacts disproportionately on rape and sexual assault cases, leading to markedly lower conviction rates, and last month the Scottish government opened a consultation on the verdict with a view to reforming it. In October 2018, a former St Andrews University student Miss M successfully sued her attacker, Stephen Coxen. The court found he had raped her while she was too drunk to consent, after they met at a nightclub during freshers’ week in 2013. Coxen was previously prosecuted for rape but the verdict was not proven. Ms AB said: “No amount of money would remove the memory and the trauma that I’ve lived with over the last six and a half years. “Money will never replace that feeling of if he had been found guilty in the criminal trial.” She would like to see reform of the justice system not just in Scotland but across the United Kingdom, whether that is the not proven verdict, treatment of women giving evidence or “pathetic” sentences. Her message to other women struggling with the justice system was simple: “Never give up. Don’t be silent because your voice is the most powerful thing you have.” Paying tribute to the “courage and perseverance” of Ms AB, the chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, Sandy Brindley, said: “This civil case – and the many criminal cases that have come before – highlight just how urgent action is to reform the justice system. We have to address the issues that make the process so unbearable for those who report sexual crimes and ensure that the system is robust.”",News/UK news,"Court rules woman was raped, in landmark Scottish civil case",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/27/soldier-raped-woman-he-met-in-dundee-nightclub-court-rules

1/27/2022," Occupation Retired IT consultant Voting record Neal’s first vote was for the SDP in 1983, since when he has usually voted Labour. He describes himself as “a hardcore remainiac” Amuse bouche He has raced in the Isle of Man TT Occupation Dentist Voting record Jørgen is from Denmark and lived in Germany for many years. He voted for liberal democrat parties in both countries. He has been on the Isle of Man for only six months, and describes himself as centre-right Amuse bouche He appeared in the magazine Billed-Bladet – roughly like Denmark’s Hello! – because he was at a wedding of a semi-famous friend, and his wife was wearing a kimono Neal We were both prepared to be friendly, and stayed friendly the whole time. It was a pretty convivial evening. Jørgen I wouldn’t say it was love at first sight, but we had a good bond. We talked about face masks. I think the rules stray into the personal rights of people. The blue and white masks were designed against bacteria. Those masks last for roughly half an hour, because they get wet and the pores get bigger. So they don’t work that well against bacteria – and viruses are so small they can get through. Neal I was surprised about someone who works in a medical area seeming to suggest the holes in the masks are bigger than the virus. The virus isn’t a free-floating thing: it resides in water droplets, and the masks stop the droplets. Neal The climate does change over geological time, but the changes we have seen in the last 100, 200 years have to be down to human activity. Jørgen There is too much consensus, no opposing views. The climate is changing, but I’m doubting it is man-made. In hindsight, we often see that 20, 40 years ago we were wrong. A bit like cholesterol and butter and all those things; 20 years ago, they were the most dangerous things you could put into your body; now the same scientists are saying: “Sorry, we miscalculated, it’s good for you.” Neal Neither of us is a climate scientist, so our perspectives have to come from an emotional response to what we read and what is in the culture. Jørgen I’m sceptical. I rethink, and doubt, even my own actions. And I’m in favour of personal freedom. I want to have my thoughts: drive my car, eat my meat, make bad jokes about certain groups of people. I don’t want to offend people, but I want the right to offend. Neal You see on a daily basis how the UK has become smaller and less influential because of what it has done to itself. Brexit is a national tragedy. Jørgen We agreed about Brexit. I’m in favour of the European Union. It’s a big bureaucratic monster where it is difficult to have influence, but it is a good rallying point for Europe. But … Jørgen … countries should have the right to control immigration, and you should only be able to go to a foreign country if you have a job there. The European Union is too lenient. Neal Europe needs an influx of people because of the demographic situation. I would say Jørgen is a “Fortress Europe” person. His issue is European culture and values compared with Africa and the Middle East. Jørgen I see us in Europe with a more Christian background and heritage, and if you come to Europe from outside you should accept these values, like equality of men and women, freedom of religion. I see some who don’t want to agree with those values. Neal That sounded to me like quite old-school racist talk, tarring people who are non-European with a pretty broad brush. Jørgen Without discussion, without different opinions, there would be no progress. You need disagreement, because you are forced to defend your opinions, and maybe form new ones. It was a very nice evening, but too short. Neal People mostly don’t like confrontation. So it’s unusual to deliberately focus on those things, which was healthy. It was also good to be able to separate these existential political matters from the human being you are sharing a glass of wine with. But because we really exposed ourselves by the end, I was thinking: “Yeah, there are some aspects of you I am not comfortable with.” Additional reporting: Naomi Larsson  Neal and Jørgen ate at Épernay in Douglas.
