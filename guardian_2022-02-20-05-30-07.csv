2/20/2022,"Marcelo Bielsa would have made an awful politician. One of his more refreshingly idiosyncratic traits is his habit of never pointing the finger of blame at somebody else when he can point it at himself. There are times when this appetite for self-criticism takes on an almost monastic hue: a live Zoom flagellation, a reminder that no external judgment on Bielsa could ever be as scathing or searching as his own. Injuries, individual errors, referees, fixture pile-ups, financial disparities: in the world of Bielsa none of this really seems to register. “The position of [Mateusz] Klich was an error on my part,” he said after last Saturday’s 3-0 crushing at Everton, after an appalling performance by the Pole in midfield.  On Friday, he was asked about the misfiring Tyler Roberts, who has attracted some criticism from Leeds fans. “It is necessary that I take on more responsibility,” Bielsa said sagely. In a sense Bielsa’s self-incrimination is a kind of protective shield around his players and staff, a reassurance that ultimately the buck stops with him. It is also a recognition no other Premier League manager enjoys his level of unquestioned authority. And yet it is a stance that often obscures as much as it reveals. After all, when you are 15th in the table before this weekend’s matches after conceding more goals per 90 minutes, excluding penalties, than any other team and have no recognised senior striker, the problems clearly go beyond one maverick coach. Leeds face Manchester United on Sunday in an unusually precarious position. They have a six-point cushion on 18th place but tough fixtures – Liverpool, Tottenham, Leicester and Aston Villa – to follow. Beneath them, Everton and Newcastle are buoyant under new management. Watford should improve under Roy Hodgson. Norwich have already improved under Dean Smith. Burnley have two games in hand. For the first time in six seasons, Leeds are looking down rather than up. To a fanbase still high on the giddy joyride of promotion, still accustoming itself to the tactile thrill of Premier League football after 16 years and a pandemic, relegation remains the great unspeakable. Nobody has the faintest clue whether Bielsa will commit to a fifth season. Nobody knows when Patrick Bamford, last season’s top scorer, will return from injury. A transfer window that ended with no signings has only heightened the sense of drama, an acute discomfort you suspect will pursue Leeds all the way to summer. Leeds did try to do a little business in the window. There was a persistent approach for the midfielder Brenden Aaronson, persistently rebuffed by RB Leipzig. There was some tentative interest in Kenedy at Chelsea. By all accounts, the funds were available if the right target emerged. But nor did you ever get the sense that Leeds were desperate to reinforce, even with an injury crisis to negotiate and survival in the balance. So what, exactly, is the strategy here? It is a frequent trope of punditry and commentary that signings are analogous with ambition, that by investing in the playing squad a club is showing its support for a manager. At Leeds, weirdly, the reverse seems to be true: that in refusing to sign players that do not fit the broader plan the club is demonstrating its commitment to Bielsa’s vision. Ambition, meanwhile, is defined not in material outlay but in the urge to redefine expectations, to push the current squad to the very limits of its own ability. At which point, a pertinent question presents itself. What if those limits have already been reached? Leeds have the 19th biggest wage bill in the league and the bulk of a squad that came up with them from the Championship. What if, after lavishly overachieving for the past three seasons, there are no more marginal improvements to be mined? What if there is no beyond? What if the well of miracles has finally run dry? Certainly, the baseline numbers suggest a sharp decline from last season’s ninth-place finish. But the really interesting part is which areas have declined and which have not. Shots on target – for and against – are largely similar to last season. Their passing statistics – completion rate, progression, passes into the final third – are down, but not by much. According to FBref.com they still top the Premier League in defensive pressures, tackles and interceptions per 90 minutes, which suggests the furious workrate that has defined all Bielsa teams has not markedly dropped. But the most dramatic changes have been at either end of the pitch. Last season, Leeds were fourth in the league for shot accuracy per 90 minutes; this season they are 18th. They were second in save percentage match; now they are 16th. What this suggests is that the fundamentals of this Leeds side remain sound: from penalty area to penalty area, they are almost as good as they were. The difference is that last season Bamford was reliably putting away his chances and Illan Meslier was reliably stopping them. Now, for various reasons, neither is doing so. Perhaps Leeds are convinced that their injuries will clear up, Bamford will return, Meslier will find his form and Leeds will soon be heading up the table. But there are no guarantees of any of this. Nobody can say how a fourth-season Bielsa team will cope late in the season because none of his previous jobs got that far. Everyone here – from the fans to the club hierarchy to Bielsa – is in largely unknown territory. The future of Bielsa will not be resolved before the summer, with talk that the former RB Leipzig coach Jesse Marsch is being sought as a replacement. All of which merely underlines the courage required to commit so fully to a vision and a philosophy that may not even be around in a few months’ time. But in many ways the defining quality of the Bielsa era at Leeds has been a certain faith: faith in the process, faith in the system, faith in the squad, faith in the man himself. The coming weeks, you feel, will see that faith tested like never before.",Sport/Football,Marcelo Bielsa in test of faith with Leeds entering unknown territory | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/19/marcelo-bielsa-in-test-of-faith-with-leeds-entering-unknown-territory
2/20/2022,"There was a rumour this past week that Brendan Rodgers had been sacked as manager of Leicester City. It turned out not to be true, but the fact it seemed so believable was telling. The improved performance against West Ham – when they were denied victory only by a late equaliser that prompted one of football’s increasingly frequent epistemological debates: what is a hand? – has perhaps calmed the situation beforeSunday’s game against Wolves, but the pressure is real enough. Rodgers may have twice taken Leicester to fifth in the Premier League (with the ninth-highest wage bill) and won the FA Cup only last season, but the discontent at the King Power has been palpable. It was this week five years ago that Leicester sacked Claudio Ranieri, who had led them to the title the season before. Then perhaps a change could be justified as a sad necessity to head off the threat of relegation. But that is not a realistic possibility this season, even if Leicester’s run without a domestic win now extends to five games, including that humiliating FA Cup defeat by Nottingham Forest.  This is modern football. One season’s achievement becomes the next season’s expectation. Credit in the bank is burned so quickly as to be largely notional. There are no second chances: as soon as anything goes wrong the automatic call is for the dismissal of the manager; one bad month can obliterate years of development and achievement. Yet it’s an open secret that Rodgers has been under consideration by Manchester City to succeed Pep Guardiola when he finally leaves the club, and that his interest in that position was one of the reasons he wasn’t offered the Tottenham job in the summer. Rodgers plays the right sort of football. He is one of only four managers ever to win silverware with Leicester (and only two if you exclude the League Cup). He won every possible domestic trophy with Celtic. He took Liverpool closer to the league title than they had been in 24 years. He took Swansea to promotion. He has a record of developing young players. But that presents a paradox: how can Rodgers have last year been a candidate to take over the serial league champions and yet now be apparently on the brink at Leicester? There is a theory that Rodgers is peculiarly susceptible to Bela Guttmann’s dictum that the third year is fatal, that after two seasons players begin to tire of his methods. And it probably is true that there is a natural shelf-life to some of the guru-gimmicks that were exposed in the Being Liverpool TV documentary. But evidence to back that up is slim to nonexistent. Rodgers was at Swansea for only two seasons. It’s true his third season at Liverpool saw a drop-off from 2.21 points per game to 1.63. But then that may simply have been the result of the sale of Luis Suárez to Barcelona coupled with regression to the mean after an exceptional season and a sense of emotional exhaustion having come so close to winning the Premier League. When Rodgers left Celtic in the February of his third season, they were picking up 2.33 points per game, as opposed to 2.15 in his second. Still, the idea that managers have a natural cycle of about three years is one that has been persistent for at least half a century. When Jack Charlton took the Middlesbrough job in 1973, he was warned by Jock Stein about the need to alleviate staleness at all costs, either by moving on himself or shaking up the team. But then, as Rodgers himself acknowledged this week, at a club of Leicester’s stature, that process of renewal is built in as better players look to move on: in recent years no English side has been so successful at identifying relatively inexpensive young talent, nurturing it and selling it on. Youri Tielemans, who has been linked with Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United, looks likely to be the next Leicester star to be sold. But, more fundamentally, it’s impossible to assess Leicester this season without taking into account the players they have been without. Wesley Fofana has missed 23 league games with injury, James Justin 19, Nampalys Mendy 14, Jonny Evans 13, Ricardo Pereira 10, Timothy Castagne six and Jamie Vardy and Tielemans each four. Kelechi Iheanacho, Wilfred Ndidi and Mendy were all away at the Africa Cup of Nations. It’s not just that that’s a lot of players missing a lot of games, it’s that so many of them are concentrated at the back, where they have coincided with (and possibly contributed to) Caglar Soyuncu suffering a post-Euros loss of form. That may explain in part, although only in part, why they have let in 11 goals from corners this season, more than any other Premier League side and a remarkable 27% of their total goals conceded. But Leicester also let in 11 from corners last season, which was the joint worst in the division; this is a continuing problem. Rodgers switched to a man-marking system from set plays after the win over Liverpool before New Year but without obvious improvement. Rodgers has come dangerously close to blaming his players, saying: “You can go zonal, you can block, you can go man to man, but in defending a corner you have to have that will to head it.” To an extent he’s right, and when better defenders return and confidence improves, Leicester probably will be more decisive. But that doesn’t explain why this is such a long-term issue. So that is an obvious concern, a problem that requires a solution. It may be that Rodgers is unable to find it, that some form of third (full) season syndrome has afflicted him and that the situation is irrecoverable. But the injuries offer just as reasonable an explanation. There are times when a manager is clearly stagnating and change is necessary but, even with all the absences, Leicester went into the weekend only two places below where their wage bill suggests they should be (with two games in hand). Football is an impatient sport, but this surely is a time for Leicester to hold their nerve.",Sport/Football,Leicester must hold their nerve as Rodgers faces third-season syndrome | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/19/leicester-must-hold-their-nerve-as-brendan-rodgers-faces-third-season-syndrome
2/20/2022,"Andrew Garfield has opened up about the grief of losing his mother to pancreatic cancer, saying it left him in “precise agony” and struggling to make sense of the world around him. The actor, 38, who was recently nominated for an Oscar for his role in Netflix biography Tick, Tick… Boom!, started filming just after Lynn Garfield, a teacher from Essex, died in 2019.  “It is very, very difficult, I think with a loss like that the world gets rearranged and I say that knowing I am not unique in that experience,” he told Jackie Long on Channel 4. “It’s so strange because it feels very unique when it is happening, it feels like, ‘oh my God, I’m the only person that’s ever lost their mother’, because it does feel so lonely and precise. “It feels just like a precise agony and for a period of time I didn’t want to, and I wasn’t able to, do anything. I was kind of wasted and the world didn’t make sense, and it still doesn’t, because I miss her greatly, and I hope it never makes sense because I always want to miss her.” Garfield plays Jonathan Larson in the biography, the lyricist and composer of the musical Rent who died on the day it opened. It is the directorial debut of Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, and tells of the challenges Larson faced attempting to break into the industry by writing a new musical. Garfield has already been recognised for the role, winning best actor in a musical/comedy film at the Golden Globes – something he believes his mother would have been proud of. “She was proud of my achievements but she was much more proud of how I treated someone in Sainsbury’s or Asda that was checking us out with our groceries. She was someone that was about the small kindnesses in life,” he said. “If I’m short-tempered with someone, if I’m having a rough day and someone walks past me and they’re nice to me and I’m gruff, I will feel a little hand on my shoulder. It will be my mother’s hand, and I hear her say, ‘Andrew …’, and I’ll go back and I’ll say, ‘Hey, sorry, that was a bit rude of me.’ “I hope she never takes a hand off my shoulder in that way.” Garfield previously spoke to Variety about his mother’s death, saying he had only just learned of her diagnosis before he went to North Carolina to shoot The Eyes of Tammy Faye. He said his mother encouraged him to go, and agreed to let him know when it was time to come home. He travelled back to England to be by her side in late 2019. Speaking to GQ in November, he said there was “nothing left unsaid” between them. “We had all the quality time we could possibly have while she was here,” he said. “And those last two weeks I got to be with her were probably the most profound two weeks of my life. “To be with her and my dad and my brother, all of her friends, my nephews. It was full of grace in the midst of the terrible tragedy.”",Arts/Film,Andrew Garfield reveals ‘precise agony’ of losing his mother to cancer,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/19/andrew-garfield-reveals-precise-agony-of-losing-his-mother-to-cancer
2/20/2022,"Harry Kane always believed that he would have a say in the destination of the Premier League title. It was just that he thought he would be helping Manchester City towards it rather than standing in their way. The England captain’s desire to join City last summer has been well-documented. Tottenham simply said no. Kane seemed determined to show City what they were missing here.  Kane was simply superb from start to finish, producing one of the finest individual performances of the season. He played a role in Dejan Kulusevski’s early opener and, after Ilkay Gündogan had capitalised on a Hugo Lloris error to equalise for City, Kane made it 2-1 midway through the second-half, advertising the statement victory that Antonio Conte has craved. During a dramatic finale, it looked as if it would elude Spurs. Kane had seen a goal for 3-1 ruled out by VAR for a marginal offside against Kulusevski in the build-up and then, with the 90 minutes almost up, the technology would intervene to award City a penalty, the replays showing that Cristian Romero had handled a cross-cum-shot from Bernardo Silva. Riyad Mahrez, on as a substitute, swept into the top corner. And yet there was still time for a further twist. Kulusevski crossed from the right and, with the City defence static, Kane rose to head into the bottom corner. Spurs’s quest for a top four finish has an injection of belief but City saw their lead over Liverpool - winners over Norwich earlier in the day - cut to six points. It felt like a long time ago that Spurs were beating City 1-0 at home on the opening weekend of the season because plenty has changed in north London, not least the identity of the manager. Even in victory over City, which was a third straight home league win over them, it was possible to question whether Nuno Espírito Santo was the right man for Spurs. Conte has shaken things up, especially in January, and it was one of his new signings that helped Spurs to make the dream start. Kulusevski was in the starting XI for the first time and he swept home nervelessly from Son Heung-min’s square ball which took out the City goalkeeper, Ederson. Son had raced onto Kane’s first-time, around-the-corner pass – a lovely pre-assist which cut City apart – and the South Korean showed great composure when teeing up Kulusevski. Game on. Kane was always going to be a prominent sub-plot and, if his ball for Son was the early highlight, showcasing the instinctive understanding between the pair, there were other moments when the England captain dropped deep to ping passes. Kane could see Son sprinting through a high City line on 23 minutes only to play the ball fractionally behind him. It was easy to wonder whether that would prove to be a turning point. The pattern had been set at the start. City on the front foot, hogging possession, probing and pinning Spurs back; the visitors holding their shape, looking to break things up and counter at pace. City explode in flurries, flying at opponents from many angles, creating openings and they had one from the 17th minute. João Cancelo was the catalyst. Playing high up the left flank, a full-back in name only, Cancelo tricked past two white shirts to curl wide; almost combined with Raheem Sterling and also lashed a rising drive off target. In amongst it all, Gündogan got the better of Pierre-Emile Højbjerg to curl against the far post. Spurs defended valiantly in the first-half, with Romero catching the eye. Ben Davies made one vital block; Emerson Royal two more. Which was why the manner of the equaliser was so hard for them to accept. Sterling’s cross from the inside left looked non-threatening, even though Kevin De Bruyne stretched to try to reach it. Perhaps that unnerved Hugo Lloris. But really there was no excuse for what the veteran goalkeeper did next. He went down to collect only to allow the ball to bounce off him. Gündogan, who had come in for City’s top scorer, Mahrez, blasted home. Spurs wanted a foul on Ryan Sessegnon by Kyle Walker in the build-up but that was many phases beforehand. Rúben Dias needed to be alert to snap into a tackle on Kane in the 39th minute and Spurs continued to believe after the interval that they could break out and hurt City. Kane threatened to connect with Son and Kulusevski and then he turned the game on its head, making a mockery of City’s territorial dominance. Kane started the move, dropping off to play yet another pass and, when City cleared only as far as Sessegnon, the centre-forward continued his run. Sessegnon found Son and he picked out Kane with a perfectly floated cross. The close-range finish was clinical. If only it had been shortly afterwards after Son once again played him through. This time, Ederson made a big one-on-one save. The closing stages were pulsating. After Lloris had saved brilliantly to keep out a Gündogan curler, Kane thought he had clinched it when he beat Ederson inside the near post. The goal would be ruled out by VAR – a cruel break for Spurs. It would get more cruel. Kane, however, was not finished.",Sport/Football,Harry Kane’s header gives Tottenham dramatic 3-2 win at Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/19/manchester-city-tottenham-premier-league-match-report
