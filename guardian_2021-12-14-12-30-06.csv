12/14/2021,"Covid restrictions in New South Wales are set to ease, including those for unvaccinated people, despite epidemiologists urging caution amid rising case numbers and the Omicron variant. NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said the government would “look at all options”, but the emergence of the Omicron strain and rising case numbers wouldn’t affect the relaxing of restrictions.  “At the moment, our government here … is very keen to get us all back to normality, to our previous life,” he said. “We’re not going to start backflipping on issues we promised the community we’ll do.” From Wednesday, 15 December, masks will only be required on public transport and in airports, or for indoors front-of-house hospitality staff who aren’t fully vaccinated. QR code check-ins will be dropped except for high risk venues including hospitals, aged and disability care facilities, gyms, places of worship, funerals, personal services, pubs and clubs and outdoor music festivals with over 1,000 people. Density limits will be dropped for all settings, and restrictions will be uniform across the state regardless of a person’s vaccination status. But epidemiology chair at University of South Australia, Adrian Esterman, said until we know how severe the Omicron strain is, more caution was needed. “Although there are anecdotal reports that Omicron is milder than Delta, we simply do not yet have hard data to show that this is the case,” he said. “Until we do, for me it simply makes no sense to relax public health measures, especially things like face mask mandates in stores.” He also said there was “ample evidence” around the world that vaccination alone wasn’t sufficient to prevent outbreaks. “In NSW and Victoria, we have seen that high rates of vaccination plus some public health measures has been able to keep case numbers and hospitalisations stable,” he said. “By relaxing the public health measures, case numbers will go up, and we are already seeing this in NSW.” NSW cases jumped to a 10-week high on Tuesday. There were 804 new cases recorded in the state and one death, up from 536 cases reported on Monday. Health authorities have expressed concern over the spread of the new strain of the virus emerging from a super-spreading event in Newcastle and over a growing cluster in Byron Bay. Eighty-four people who attended The Argyle House nightclub in Newcastle on 8 December have tested positive for the virus. Authorities said it was likely a number of the cases were the Omicron variant, with genomic testing results still to come. Hazzard said rising cases in the Hunter were a “very telling” reminder of the continued presence of the virus as the state opened to the unvaccinated. “My message to the vaccinated, you might be out and about now but you are very vulnerable to what is a rapidly increasing number of Covid cases here in NSW,” he said. “I would not be hanging out with too many unvaccinated when the numbers have quadrupled in the last few weeks … once the unvaccinated are mixing with the vaccinated the numbers will increase even further.

If research shows high efficacy of current vaccines against Omicron, then mask use may be discontinued as planned. “We also need to understand that the pandemic is not yet over and new strains may keep emerging due to inequitable distribution of vaccine globally.” There were 168 people being treated in hospital on Tuesday, including 21 requiring intensive care – the lowest number of Covid patients in ICU since 18 July. 94.8% of people over 16 had received their first dose of a vaccine in NSW, while 93.2% were fully vaccinated.",News/Australia news,NSW Covid restrictions: easing of rules to go ahead despite sharp rise in case numbers,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/14/nsw-covid-restrictions-easing-of-rules-to-go-ahead-despite-sharp-rise-in-case-numbers
