12/28/2021,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called Kwanzaa a ""fake religion created by a psychopath."" Greene made the remark in response to a statement by the College Republican National Committee. The annual weeklong celebration of African history and culture was introduced in 1966. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called Kwanzaa a ""fake religion created by a psychopath"" on Sunday as millions began to celebrate the weeklong holiday. Greene made the remark in response to a statement by the College Republican National Committee, a national organization of conservative college students. ""Wishing you a happy and prosperous Kwanza,"" the group tweeted Sunday. Greene responded to the tweet by saying the organization was ""turning people away"" by posting the holiday greeting. ""Stop. It's a fake religion created by a psychopath,"" Greene wrote. ""You aren't bringing in new voters, you are turning them away. People are tired of pandering and BS."" Introduced by professor Maulana Karenga in 1966, Kwanzaa is an annual weeklong celebration in which African American families give gifts, eat traditional meals, and light candles in honor of their ancestors. Greene's tweet seemed to reference Karenga, who was convicted of felony assault in connection with a 1970 attack on two female members of the US Organization, a Black nationalist group in Los Angeles, according to the Los Angeles Times. While Greene condemned Kwanzaa — which she incorrectly called a religion — her GOP counterparts have previously offered holiday greetings to those who celebrate it. In 2017, President Donald Trump issued a statement, saying: ""Let us celebrate during this joyous time the richness of the past and look with hope toward a brighter future. ""As families and friends join to light the Kinara, Melania and I extend our warmest wishes for a joyful holiday season and a prosperous year to come."" In 2013, the Republican National Committee also wished people a happy Kwanzaa. ""Wishing those celebrating a joyous time with loved ones and a time of meaningful reflection ahead of the New Year,"" the organization wrote in a tweet. Representatives for Greene and the College Republican National Committee did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment.

12/28/2021,"A restaurant worker in Las Vegas’ Chinatown is recovering after being shot multiple times in what appeared to be an attempted burglary last week.

What happened: Chengyan Wang was deep-cleaning Shanghai Taste in the 4200 block of Spring Mountain Road when a man broke in around 3 a.m. on Dec. 20. The suspect, identified later as Rashawn Gaston-Anderson, shot him seven times, according to KSNV.
 Wang opted to stay late on the night of Dec. 19 to perform the deep clean, which he does every week. Surveillance video reportedly showed the suspect trying to break in through multiple back doors until he reached the restaurant. It’s unclear what happened inside the business, but Wang “defiantly” tried to fight the suspect, according to Shanghai Taste managing partner Joe Muscaglione. The suspect fled without stealing, but they believe the incident was an attempted burglary. Wang, who wound up outside the restaurant, reportedly suffered four shots to the abdomen, one to the shoulder, another through the neck and one on a hand. A security guard at Shanghai Plaza, where the restaurant is located, found him and called for help. 


The aftermath: Wang was taken to UMC Trauma Center, where he remained in critical condition before Christmas Day. Two fundraisers have been set up to help with his medical expenses.
 As Wang recovers, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department identified Gaston-Anderson, 23, as a suspect in the shooting. He is known to frequent tourist corridor areas, FOX 5 reported. Wang lives in the U.S. by himself, sending money back to his family in China. Muscaglione described him as a polite and respectful employee who has a strong work ethic. “I’ve never seen anything like it. Just a good, hard, loyal worker,” Muscaglione told KTNV. In an update three days later to their original Dec. 20 Facebook post about the incident, Shanghai Taste wrote, ""Wang is going to make it! He opened his eyes and has had three successful surgeries."" The Las Vegas Asian Chamber of Commerce organized a GoFundMe page to raise money for Wang’s medical bills. The Asian Community Development Council, which is also based in the city, set up a separate fundraiser via Mightycause. 
Gaston-Anderson remains at large. Anyone with information on his whereabouts is urged to call Las Vegas police at 702-828-2639 or Crime Stoppers at 702-385-5555.

12/28/2021,"Electric vehicles and gas cars have always come with a tradeoff. Fully electric vehicles are more expensive to buy, but they’re cheaper to own because they’re cheaper to fuel and maintain — and they produce zero emissions. Traditional cars cost less up front, but you pay more in the long run thanks to the high cost of dirty gas. That dynamic is still widely accepted as true, but compelling new evidence reveals a disconnect between the metrics used to analyze fuel costs and the realities that EV drivers face on the ground. So, are EVs really cheaper to power than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles? Well, that depends on the yardstick you use when measuring. Also See: Want To Switch to an EV? Consider These 2021 Standouts
More: 13 Cars That Are Bad News for Tesla In 2020, the Department of Energy (DOE) released a study that was more comprehensive than those that had come before. Using a state-level assessment of EV charging costs, the study’s results were much more granular than what came out of previous studies, which assumed a singular value. It found that the national average to charge an EV is $0.15 per kWh, which DOE determined translated into savings of as much as $14,500 over 15 years on fuel costs alone. On top of that, EVs are cheaper to maintain — $0.04 cheaper per mile, according to the DOE — which adds another $8,000 in savings for EV drivers over the course of 200,000 miles. The jury had returned a verdict. Yes, EVs cost more to buy, but they paid their owners back for the difference and then some over the life of the car — plus the whole zero-emissions thing — and that’s not even counting state and federal tax credits and other incentives. But a different study was about to get even more granular. Find: States With Electric Vehicle Incentives On Oct. 21, 2021, the Anderson Economic Group — a respected economic consulting firm with decades of auto industry experience — released the results of its own study, which was six months in the making. It was the first installation in a larger economic research series that is still being conducted. Anderson parsed the costs of EV charging much more finely, going beyond just a state-by-state breakdown to examine rural/urban variations. The new methodology also separated vehicles by segment, use and cost. Titled “Comparison: Real World Cost of Fueling EVs and ICE Vehicles,” the report’s startling results were summarized in its official synopsis: “Electric vehicles can be more expensive to fuel than their internal combustion engine counterparts.” More: The Most Reliable Car Brands on the Road DOE says that the average cost of electricity for an EV is $0.04 per mile, which means it costs $9 to fully charge a battery with a 200-mile range. By comparison, it costs between $0.07 and $0.10 per mile to fuel a gas car, according to AAA. The Anderson study, however, challenged the presumption that EVs are cheaper to drive — or even cheaper to fuel. It found that powering EVs comes with four hidden costs: the purchase of a home charger, the greatly inflated price of commercial charging at public stations, “deadhead miles” spent driving to find far-flung charging stations and registration taxes that states slap on EV drivers to make up for the fact that they don’t pay gas taxes. The study also factored in the cost of time spent searching for reliable charging stations, which — even when located — can take a half-hour for a charge of 20% to 80%. Traditional research — like the industry standard provided by DOE — doesn’t take any of that into account. It also presumes a heavily lopsided reliance on cheap, at-home charging instead of expensive commercial charging. Advice: 16 Unexpected Car Costs and How To Prepare for Them Now Again, the new research is just the first installment in a larger series, but its results are undeniably head-turning. The study found that: Commercial charging rates are two to four times higher than residential rates. Level 1 chargers cost an average of $600 to install and can take 20 hours to fully charge an EV. Level 2 chargers are much faster but cost $1,600. “Full charge” is a misleading term because charging past 90% is slow, difficult and unadvised, which means you get far fewer miles than the advertised ranges would have you believe. Gas vehicles, on the other hand, are good for 300-400 miles per tank. Considering all of those factors, and presuming a greater reliance on commercial charging, it would cost $8.58 to fuel a mid-priced gas car that gets 33 mpg for 100 miles at $2.81 a gallon. Comparatively, a mid-priced EV — Tesla Model 3, Nissan Leaf or Chevy Bolt — would cost $12.95 per 100 miles. Annually, presuming 12,000 miles driven, it would cost $1,030 to drive a gas car versus $1,554 for an EV.
