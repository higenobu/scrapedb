3/16/2022,"Amongst a market wide pullback, Alibaba (BABA) stock’s fall from grace over the past year has been one of the more eye-catching developments. The ecommerce giant just can’t seem to catch a break. Covid has reared its ugly head in China again and the prospect of US desisting for Chinese stocks is ever-present. And these developments clamber on top of regulatory clampdowns in China, a slowing economy and Alibaba going heavy on the investment side. Looking for a bright spot? Well, one is hard to find, appears to be the view of J.P. Morgan’s Alex Yao. “Due to rising geopolitical and macro risks, we believe a large number of global investors are in the process of reducing exposure to the China Internet sector, leading to significant fund outflows from the sector,” the analyst recently said. “We believe Alibaba, as one of the most widely owned stocks within the China Internet sector, will continue to face stock selling pressure in the near term.” Aside from the bearish macro sentiment, the fundamentals aren’t in great shape either. Due to the “hiking inflation and weakening consumption confidence” as a result of the COVID resurgence in China, Yao is concerned with the company’s near- to mid-term business outlook. With the core commerce business facing increasing pressure and the Chinese government's ""common prosperity"" initiative resulting in a call for more “social responsibility,” Yao thinks these could dent investor confidence in the company's long-term “earnings generation capability.” There is, however, one positive to note amongst the resoundingly negative take. As the company has already started to rein in investment spend and “optimize operations,” in the next few quarters, Yao expects to see sequential losses narrowing. “Faster-than-expected loss cuts could be a major upside risk this year,” he went on to say. However, that is not enough to stop Yao’s rating slipping all the way from Overweight (i.e., Buy) to Underweight (i.e., Sell). The price target gets a haircut too, slashed from $180 to $65. The implication for investors? Downside of ~13%. (To watch Yao’s track record, click here) Yao, though, is on his own here. In fact, of the remaining 22 analyst reviews on record, 2 rate BABA a Hold, while all 20 others recommend to Buy, resulting in a Strong Buy consensus rating. The projected gains are plentiful too; at $173.3, the average target implies shares will rise by 123% over the coming year.

3/16/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong had their worst day since the global financial crisis, as concerns over Beijing’s close relationship with Russia and renewed regulatory risks sparked panic selling. Most Read from Bloomberg Elon Musk Challenges Vladimir Putin to ‘Single Combat’ for Ukraine Ukraine Update: China Seeks to Avoid Russia Sanctions Sideswipe Putin’s State Media News Is Interrupted: ‘They’re Lying to You’ Panic Selling Grips Chinese Stocks in Biggest Plunge Since 2008 Pregnant Woman Pictured Being Evacuated From Bombed Maternity Ward Has Died The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index closed down 7.2% on Monday, the biggest drop since November 2008. The Hang Sang Tech Index tumbled 11% in its worst decline since the gauge was launched in July 2020, wiping out $2.1 trillion in value since a year-earlier peak. The broad rout follows a report citing U.S. officials that Russia has asked China for military assistance for its war in Ukraine. Even as China denied the report, traders worry that Beijing’s potential overture toward Vladimir Putin could bring a global backlash against Chinese firms, even sanctions. Sentiment was also hurt by a Covid-induced lockdown in the southern city of Shenzhen, a key tech hub, and the northern province of Jilin. That comes on top of a spate of regulatory worries. Tencent Holdings Ltd. is reportedly facing a possible record fine for violations of anti money-laundering rules, which pushed the stock down nearly 10% on Monday. There’s also a risk of Chinese firms delisting from the U.S., as the Securities and Exchange Commission identified some names as part of a crackdown on foreign firms that refuse to open their books to U.S. regulators.

BlackRock Inc.’s funds exposed to Russia have plunged by $17 billion since the war began. On Friday, the Golden Dragon Index, which tracks American depository receipts of Chinese firms, slumped 10% for a second consecutive day -- something that’s never happened before in its 22-year history. It fell 12% Monday to its lowest level since July 2013. China’s benchmark CSI 300 Index closed 3.1% lower on Monday. The onshore yuan also fell to its weakest in a month as sentiment toward Chinese assets turned sour. READ: Traders Ditch Yuan, Snap Up Bonds as Lockdown Adds to China Woes “We don’t see a major catalyst in the near term,” to help China stocks, though earnings results may create some share price volatility, said Marvin Chen, a strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. “For a material re-rating of China tech, we may need to see a shift in regulatory tone, and we didn’t get that from the recently concluded NPC meeting.” Even amid the rout, mainland traders have continued to snap up Hong Kong stocks, though that’s proving insufficient to buttress share prices. They have been net buying Hong Kong equities via the stock connect in every session since Feb. 22, loading up $1 billion on Monday, the most since January. China Bulls The historic slide in tech stocks is baffling China bulls, the number of which had grown this year as strategists bet on a rebound thanks to policy easing by the People’s Bank of China. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists toned down their optimism slightly on China stocks, slashing their valuation estimates for the MSCI China Index. “We stay overweight China on well-anchored growth expectations/targets, easing policy, depressed valuations/sentiment, and low investor positioning,” but lower our 12-month valuation target from 14.5 times to 12 times on changes in the global macro environment and higher geopolitical risks, strategists including Kinger Lau wrote in note dated Monday. The MSCI China Index has seen its valuation more than halve from a Feb. 2021 peak. The gauge is trading at about 9 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, versus a five-year average of 12.6. “It’s true that the valuation is cheap but if you are desperately closing your positions, valuations don’t matter,” said Yasutada Suzuki, head of emerging market investments at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank.
