5/4/2022,"Britain’s accounting watchdog has opened four investigations into the audits of four companies owned by the metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta under the Liberty Steel banner. The Financial Reporting Council said it had started investigating the statutory audits of the businesses by the firm King & King. The move follows a call from MPs for the FRC to refer the auditors for investigation. Liberty Steel has been facing growing troubles since its key financial backer, Greensill Capital, collapsed in March 2021, sparking an ongoing attempt for it to find new lenders. Gupta controls Liberty Steel through GFG Alliance, an informal group of metals and energy companies that employs as many as 35,000 people worldwide, including about 3,000 in UK steel. His main British assets are a series of steel plants under the Liberty Steel name, including large operations at Rotherham and Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire and smaller facilities in Wales and the Midlands, as well as an aluminium smelter in Scotland. A scathing report by a group of MPs into Gupta and his metals empire released last November last year flagged several areas of concern, including Liberty Steel’s audits. They also called on Gupta to be investigated for potential breaches of his duties as a company director. The MPs on the business select committee said they had found “weaknesses in audit”, adding that frequent changes of auditors and accounting deadlines represented “red flags”. The committee’s report found that the small audit firm King & King had “a lack of capacity to complete audits effectively”. Milan Patel, a partner at King & King, previously told the committee his organisation was capable of auditing an organisation of GFG’s size and said the firm had “many clients who have hundreds of millions of pounds of turnover”. The new FRC investigation relates to the audits of the financial statements of the companies: Liberty Special Steels Limited, Alvance British Aluminium Limited (formerly known as Liberty Aluminium Lochaber Ltd), and Liberty Steel Newport Limited for the year to 31 March 2019, as well as the audit of Liberty Performance Steels Limited for the year to 31 March 2020. King & King has been approached for comment. A GFG spokesperson said that none of the alliance’s entities or individuals were the subjects of the FRC investigation, adding: “We recognise the importance of strong audit practices and have been evolving our corporate structure and governance as we continue our efforts to restructure and refinance our portfolio.” Concerns have been raised for some time over the corporate governance of GFG, and the UK government rejected the company’s request for a £170m bailout after the collapse of Greensill Capital. It is understood ministers had concerns over its opaque corporate structure. Last week, investigators from the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) requested documents and questioned executives at the UK offices of companies owned by Gupta. The SFO is investigating “suspected fraud, fraudulent trading and money laundering” in relation to GFG and Greensill Capital. A spokesperson for GFG declined to comment at the time. It came after French prosecutors raided the Paris offices of GFG Alliance as part of an investigation into allegations of “misuse of corporate assets” and money laundering. Gupta’s company said after the raids: “We strongly reject any suggestion of wrongdoing and we will continue to cooperate fully with the French authorities to help them bring this matter to a swift conclusion.”",News/Business,FRC launches inquiry into audits of four Liberty Steel companies,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/frc-inquiry-audits-four-liberty-steel-companies-sanjeev-gupta

The line is set to massively boost capacity on transport in London and south-east England, cutting journey times, with a number of new stations and much longer, spacious trains. The Elizabeth line will initially operate as three separate railways, with the overground services already running as TfL Rail in the west and east planned to join directly with the central section from this autumn.

5/4/2022,"“Normally, I can go either way, but I don’t like what’s going on in the Conservative party,” says Dawn Gibbs, standing on her doorstep in the seaside town of Worthing. “At the last general [election] I did vote Conservative, but I’m not going to vote for them this time.” Asked if she means Partygate, she nods. A delighted Andy Whight, the Labour candidate for the ward in this Thursday’s local elections, tells her: “That’s what we’re picking up every day, all over this area.” Labour has gradually built up support in this Sussex town since 2017, when Beccy Cooper won the party’s first seat in a byelection – in Marine ward, where Whight is standing in the hope of joining her. On another doorstep just down the street, Jody Aked tells him: “We’re voting for you. I’m more of a Green party person probably, but obviously I’m really keen to get the Tories out.” She cites concerns over the cost of living crisis, saying her family will be partly protected because they have solar panels and an electric car, but she realises many others will not be so lucky. Edward Hardy wants to talk to Whight about a row of chestnut trees at the end of his road that were cut down by a developer. He says he’s voted Conservative “more often than not. But not this time”. Earlier, swapping anecdotes in Cooper’s sunny back garden before heading out canvassing, Labour activists reported many similar conversations in recent days. “I wouldn’t have believed it, the number of long-term Tory voters who are saying they won’t vote for the Tories again,” said Rita Garner, who is standing in Worthing’s Tarring ward, hoping to replace longtime Liberal Democrat councillor Robert Smytherman. Margaret Howard, standing for re-election in the Broadwater ward in the east of the town, agrees. “This morning I had a Tory say he had voted Conservative for 40 years, but it’s time for a change. We have had lots of switchers,” she says. “Some are because of the local picture, because they know about the community work that’s being done locally, and some it’s because they don’t like what’s happening nationally – but we don’t mind either way.” Cooper, who leads the Labour group on the council, explains that they’ve put together a manifesto, based on conversations with voters over those five years. It includes everything from bringing the local lido back into use to consulting on providing more dog-poo bins. “It’s about people wanting green spaces for them and their families, and a town to be proud of. It’s not really rocket science, but it’s things that everybody can get on board with,” says Cooper. Going into these local elections, Labour was level pegging with the Conservatives, on 17 seats apiece. The Tories have been running a minority administration in Worthing since Labour deprived them of their majority in a byelection last December – triggered by the resignation of a Conservative councillor, Tim Wills, who was accused by the anti-fascist campaign group Hope Not Hate of privately supporting the far-right group Patriotic Alternative. With 14 seats up for grabs next Thursday, Labour has high hopes of taking control. Not only would that put Labour in power in a longtime Conservative stronghold, but it could point the way to potential gains in what Cooper calls the “blue sea wall” at the next general election. Edward Crouch, the council’s Conservative deputy leader, is standing for re-election here in Marine ward, where Whight hopes to dislodge him. He reckons that Conservative voters are more likely to stay at home as a result of the Partygate row than to switch sides to Labour. “I don’t think it’s losing us supporters, I think it may have an effect on turnout. That’s the figures that we’ll be looking at,” he says. “Our voters don’t vote against us very often, they just stay at home and shout at the telly.” Locally, he says the Conservatives have been “a really solid, safe pair of hands when it comes to delivering”, but he adds: “At the same time, I don’t think any of us Conservatives locally are naive enough not to recognise that change is really sexy, and the promises of change are sexy.” Recent years have brought younger, professional voters flocking into this once true-blue Tory seaside town – along the coast from Brighton and down the train line from London. Down on the breezy seafront, as the smell of seaweed wafts up from the beach, the seafood joint Crabshack, with its stripped wood walls, is doing a brisk trade. Coast cafe, where Labour MP Rachel Reeves came to launch the local party’s campaign, promises coffee and cake in the daytime and DJs at night. Yet away from these gentrified spots are pockets of deep poverty. Labour’s Howard, who is standing for re-election, helped set up a busy food bank when the Covid pandemic hit and has organised school uniform donations. “It’s really desperate, there’s a huge amount of demand,” she says. The former Conservative minister Tim Loughton held his East Worthing and Shoreham seat in 2019 with a modest majority of 7,474, which Labour activists believe could put it within reach next time around, though Peter Bottomley, Father of the House of Commons, holds West Worthing with an apparently impregnable 14,823. If proposed parliamentary boundary changes go through, they would create a single Worthing seat, which Labour believes it would have a good chance of taking. “Here, to have a boundary change would really consolidate all the work we’ve done in Worthing,” says Cooper. Activists from other nearby constituencies have been pouring in to help here, alongside a steady stream of Labour frontbenchers. Today, it’s the shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth. “Worthing’s been Conservative for longer than I’ve been alive, and I do think there’s that sense that it’s time for a change,” he says, after a round of canvassing in the spring sunshine. “You’ve got the rule-breaking, the scandals, the police fines and all that – and you’ve got this cost of living crisis where there is no substantive help from the government.” If Worthing does go red on Thursday, Crouch, the Conservative candidate, says it should be a wake-up call to his party not to focus all their efforts on holding Boris Johnson’s gains in the “red wall”. “There is a feeling that in defending the red wall and all these people who’ve never voted Conservative in other parts of the country, there’s a danger that Conservative heartlands will be forgotten,” he says. “I think that’s a message that if the council changes colour, I hope does land: because you can’t put all your eggs in one basket.”",News/Politics,‘We’ve had lots of switchers’: Labour candidates optimistic in Worthing,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/04/weve-had-lots-of-switchers-labour-candidates-optimistic-in-worthing
5/4/2022,"A three-year-old girl is in a critical condition after being found unconscious in a parked bus outside a childcare centre in Queensland. An ambulance service spokesperson said paramedics responded to the incident in Gracemere, near Rockhampton, just before 3pm and the child was rushed to Rockhampton hospital. A spokesperson from the hospital confirmed the girl remained in a critical condition on Wednesday evening. The child’s injuries were yet to be confirmed. Queensland police said they were investigating the incident and there was no further information available at this time. A relative of the child posted on social media that the family were “absolutely devastated” by what had occurred. “She’s been admitted to the ICU … she was semiconscious when she was found … my whole family is absolutely devastated,” she wrote. Local state MP Brittany Lauga said the incident “simply shouldn’t have happened” and confirmed there would be a full inquiry into what had occurred. “Tonight is a little girl in Gracemere who is fighting for her life in hospital,” Lauga said. “I know this little girl is very much in the thoughts of all of us tonight, wishing for a full recovery. My thoughts are with this little girl’s family and friends. “I understand the Queensland police service is the lead agency and the Department of Education as the regulator for early childhood services in Queensland will continue to assist them as necessary. We don’t yet know the full circumstances of what has occurred but of course there will be a full inquiry.” The childcare centre declined to comment. A Gracemere local who wished to remain anonymous said the area had been swamped on Wednesday afternoon by police, detectives and an ambulance. “I’d say [I saw] around five cop cars, detectives, an ambulance and both of the driveways were blocked off,” he said. “I then saw the police driving one of the buses to collect the kids from school … I hope she pulls through, beautiful little girl.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In February 2020 toddler Maliq Nicholas Floyd Namok-Malamoo, three, died of heat stress after being left in a parked bus outside a school in Cairns.

5/4/2022,"In the spring of Russia’s war on Ukraine, Washington DC seems haunted by the ghosts of history. The US Congress has passed the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022 to expedite aid to Ukraine – just as Franklin D Roosevelt did, under the Lend-Lease Act, to the British empire, China and Greece in March 1941. The sums of money being contemplated in Washington are enormous – a total of $47bn, the equivalent of one third of Ukraine’s prewar GDP. If it is approved by Congress, on top of other western aid, it will mean that we are financing nothing less than a total war. Lend-Lease was a wartime intervention. The vast majority of the goods delivered were armaments. Monty’s army in the north African desert fought with Lend-Lease Sherman tanks. After 1942, the great Soviet counter-offensives were carried by Lend-Lease trucks. What made this so extraordinary is that at the moment the Lend-Lease programme was launched in March 1941, the US was not in the war. Lend-Lease was the decisive moment in which the US, while not a combatant, abandoned neutrality. It forced jurists to come up with a new term to describe a stance of “non-belligerence”. In broader terms it marked the emergence of the United States as the hegemon that, for better and for worse, it remains today. However, history is complex – scratch the surface and the ambiguities multiply. What does invoking Lend-Lease really imply for the direction of US policy? Presumably, the narrative is sustained by the promise that a good war fought against an evil regime will be won through the generous sponsorship of the United States. But to complete that narrative arc you have to keep winding the clock forward from Lend-Lease in March to the Atlantic charter in August 1941 and, by December, to Pearl Harbor and the US entry into the war. Providing aid to both China and the British empire, Lend-Lease was a crucial step in turning what was originally a separate Japanese war on China and a German war in Europe into a world war. If the US Congress is now launching a new Lend-Lease programme, the question of whether escalation is part of the plan must come into consideration. Both friends and critics of FDR have always insisted that provoking a war with Nazi Germany was the hidden agenda of Lend-Lease. Most historians today would argue that the president’s intentions were more uncertain. Even after Pearl Harbor it was not obvious that Roosevelt could find a majority to declare war on Germany. As Brendan Simms and Charlie Laderman show in their book Hitler’s American Gamble, an extraordinary reconstruction of the fateful week following Pearl Harbor, the immediate reaction to the Japanese attack was to suspend Lend-Lease shipments; London and Moscow were horrified. It was not FDR but Hitler who saved the alliance by declaring war on the United States on the afternoon of 11 December. Then, as now, it was our antagonists who were left with the choice of whether to escalate from economic to military confrontation. Then, as now, the motives of those antagonists are obscure. After the announcement of central bank sanctions on 28 February, Putin rattled his nuclear sabre. If Biden signs a giant Lend-Lease-style aid package into law, who can tell how the Russian president will react? Further questions arise: will Ukraine be given weapons only to expel Putin’s army? Or will we equip Kyiv to strike at Russia itself? In 1941, the main Anglo-American vision was to mount an unprecedented strategic bombing campaign to lay waste to Germany’s cities and “dehouse” its population. With conventional bombs that was a real slog. But part of the quid pro quo for the Anglo-American partnership was the Tizard mission, through which British know-how, including atomic bomb development, was transferred to the US. Behind the sugar-coated narrative of a good war won by the arsenal of democracy lurks the unleashing of an apocalyptic world war. This was the nightmare that haunted Roosevelt’s opponents in America in 1941. They bemoaned the US being dragged into a second terrible conflict and the militarisation of the world order. And this was not a marginal point of view. Whereas the 2022 version of the Lend-Lease Act passed the Senate unanimously, in 1941 a third of the Senate voted against it. Roosevelt knew that the American public was not ready for war. And he hoped that the Lend-Lease Act would allow him to avoid calling for it. This was the sentiment that Churchill played into when he appealed to the US in February 1941 not to enter the war, but to give Britain and its empire the tools “and we will finish the job”. But the very generosity and scale of Lend-Lease, and the commitment that implied, brought into stark relief the fact that the US was paying for others to fight the battle on its behalf. That is precisely its position today. The US and its allies are for very good reasons choosing to back one side in a fight in which they will not directly engage. We do so like FDR, with one eye to the heroic resistance of those holding out against attack and with another eye to the geopolitical balance. If Russia has chosen to smash itself on the rock of Ukraine, if Ukraine is willing to fight, so be it. If that is the plan and Putin allows us to stick to it, it certainly has logic on its side. It is a calculation so cold-blooded that it is little wonder that we want to dress it up in half-remembered histories of the second world war, in which the happy ending is assumed without the necessary sacrifices ever being spelled out.

5/4/2022,"There’s no better way to soothe the soul – and get to know a town – than striding through its streets. In my 20s, heartbroken after getting dumped, all I could do was march with the tide of London’s rush hour until the city grew quiet and dark, and I was too exhausted to feel in shock any more. A little lost in my early 30s, I spent a six-week cat-sitting stint in New York compulsively plodding around Brooklyn and Manhattan listening to Townes Van Zandt. It was a strange and lonely time, but moving through an endless montage of concentrated history and humanity felt beautiful and instructive. The pandemic has sharpened a collective appreciation of wandering our cities with fresh eyes, exploring the streets we shunned in the pre-lockdown days, when walking was merely about hurrying from A to B. Increasingly, urban adventurers are taking this pastime even further and deciding to walk or run all of the thousands of streets that make up their warts-and-all cities. There’s even a website for tracking these epic runs or walks called CityStrides, which more than 45,000 people are using. “I can’t even wrap my head around that – so many people,” says programmer James Chevalier, who runs the site as a side project and uses the open-source site OpenStreetMap for his street statistics. So far, he says, there have been 6,300 completed attempts in various cities around the world, none of which were by him. He has covered only 45% of Holyoke, Massachusetts, but to be fair, he moved there having already done 21% of his nearby home city of Easthampton. One of those who has the satisfaction of having drawn GPS lines over every street of their city – all 6,000 in Glasgow – is secondary school teacher Michael Shanks. He lives in a block of flats with no garden and during the first lockdown, when only an hour’s daily outdoor exercise was permitted, he says: “I felt I should do something more productive with it, rather than running around the same park.” While Shanks scoured the web for ideas, up popped the celebrated trail runner Rickey Gates, who, over 45 days in 2018, ran San Francisco’s 2,237 streets, and wrote in his blog that, as well as being an excellent training incentive, the project encouraged empathy by “popping the bubbles we live in”. When Shanks first shared his GPS running data with CityStrides to see how much ground he had already covered in 15 years of living in Glasgow, it revealed he had only seen 8% of the city. “We are all creatures of habit,” he says, “and I had done thousands of runs in the same part of the west end of the city where I live.” He started his quest to experience the entire city by running from his home, but soon he was having to do 6 miles (10km) just to reach new streets. Next, he switched to stopping off on his work commute to cover other areas. Because he hadn’t meticulously planned his routes for maximum efficiency, he says, “I had to go back and redo little bits of streets, which was really frustrating, but I would definitely do that again because it felt freeing to run down random streets, and then see how many were ticked off at the end.” While some every-single-streeters, as they’re sometimes called, plot long linear routes, Shanks preferred to wiggle around smaller blocks each session because for him, “rather than an athletic challenge, I was more interested in exploring and learning about the history as I was going”. The first thing he learned on this one-year, nine-month journey was how little he really knew Glasgow. “You realise individual communities make up a city – it is not one unified place,” he says. “But in another sense, you also realise how much we are all packed into quite a small place. It’s been fascinating.” In the fairly recent past, Glasgow was cast as the murder capital of Europe, and while it still has some serious social problems, Shanks saw that things were changing. “There wasn’t anywhere that I wasn’t comfortable spending some time chatting to people,” he says, and these interactions unearthed an untold social history of the city (he is working on a book about it). This eagerness of the public to share, he suspects, was enhanced by the boredom and camaraderie prompted by the pandemic. If he ran past someone in their garden, “they were really, really keen to stop and have a chat”. One man he spoke with in Drumchapel in the north-west of the city, says Shanks, “had been moved out after slum clearances, but then the house he had been moved to was subsequently cleared because it was deemed to be inadequate housing, and then a new block was also demolished. He basically lived in the same place for 50 or 60 years but in all these different houses. Everything had changed but the community stayed the same.” Another surprise discovery was what Shanks calls “ghost streets”, where postwar housing was demolished and nothing was built in its place, leaving street lights illuminating little but a street sign, rubble and scrub. He photographed these, as well as whatever else caught his eye. Glasgow has more green space per capita than any other European city and, naturally, Shanks loved the parks. Less so, the ubiquitous “no ball games” signs, promoting the idea, he thinks, “that children should be seen and not heard. As a teacher, I quite enjoyed taking pictures of those.” No one is yet close to completing all 39,137 streets of Greater London, but in 2014, before CityStrides took off, Noelle Poulson from Utah in the US blazed a trail by walking every street within London’s congestion zone – about 400 miles, she says. Armed with a trusty A-Z, she was determined to become intimately acquainted with the city before her visa ran out. For her, she says, “it was a lot about chatting with people, and going into little shops that I hadn’t seen before, and taking photos and having picnics in the park and really engaging with the city.” “It was more magical than I thought it would be,” she continues, “because I thought it’d be looking at pretty buildings and stuff but I would end up running into street sweepers and we would have a big chat and I learned about their family, or meet people in shops and learn about how they set it up. It became a lot more about a connection with the people that I was meeting.” Discovering hidden gems in the urban landscape provided further highlights, such as a community garden in a Bermondsey alleyway called Gibbon’s Rent. “There’s a lending library there,” says Poulson. “It was very human. You see all these places where people were finding a way to make sweet little nooks and comfy places, making it their own.” Every walk she did, she says, even in places she wasn’t immediately inspired by, had something that made it worthwhile, “like, someone had taken the time to put poetry on the wall. Around Elephant and Castle, there are a lot of council estates and many of the streets look the same, but you can still find pockets where people have put up art, or you meet an interesting person.” She found that London had an abundance of public spaces to explore and says it’s always worth asking if you’re not sure if you’re allowed somewhere. “See what happens,” she says. “Be curious. Ask: ‘Hey, can I go up there? Can I see that thing? Can I go in this garden?’ It’s surprising how many times people say: ‘Yeah, of course.’ Or they’ll answer questions about it.” Before Poulson says this, however, she acknowledges her privilege, as a white woman. One CityStrider who blogged about running Seattle’s entirety wrote that the achievement felt bittersweet because, “When I told one of my friends, he pointed out that – as a Black man – he could never play this game.” Poulson, who now lives in Dili, East Timor, often encountered concern that her endeavour wasn’t safe for a woman, but she says: “I never had any incidents.” Among the many positive responses to his blog that Shanks has received, he says he has had a few emails, mostly from women, politely pointing out that “while it’s great that I’ve been able to do this, they wouldn’t feel safe walking around some parts of Glasgow, which is a fair point”. But he also says you can get the benefits without having to be completist. “I spoke to a woman who’s now running every single street in her immediate local community,” he says. “I’ve had some really lovely emails from people saying, ‘You’ve inspired me to go for a walk in a different place. And for me, it’s that sense of adventure in the place where you live that’s so important.” The every-single-streeters with very impressive stats deserve some credit, though. Top of the leaderboard is Berlin-based analytics consultant Denis Bafounta. He just covered 100% of his 12th city and is within the final few streets of completing many others. “I am on track to complete at least 40 towns around Berlin before the end of the year, or at least reach 99% – it is hard to know in advance if there will be inaccessible streets.” He has had to complete Schulzendorf four times in the past year because, he says, “new streets keep being built”. This can be a problem in Berlin, too, he adds. For him, the high point of his endeavour would be if he found a way to cover 100% of Berlin – he’s currently at 99.81%. Years ago, he says he felt uneasy running near known rightwing communities. “I am Black and I run everywhere as long as it is not private property beyond any doubt, but running every street has helped me not to care about this any more … Admittedly, it is easier for me to forget about violent reactions because I live in Germany, where not too many have weapons.” There is a strong community spirit among striders and he says he looks forward to seeing my progress. Gulp. I don’t live too far from Bristol, but I’ve only ever met it fleetingly, swooping in for occasional events, and the city’s topography makes it confusing to navigate as a newcomer. I have decided to use CityStrides to get to know it better, and approach it in the whim-following style that Shanks employed in Glasgow – only I’ll be walking, not running. On the freezing spring morning I start my project, I’m not feeling it at all, as I skirt a vast, roaring roundabout, wearing an inadequate jacket. I keep walking and looking, though, and everything eventually warms up. I ascend some pleasingly ancient-looking flights of steps, and creep around mysterious back alleys (I’m a sucker for a secret passage), and soon come upon a violin shop, then another, and then a shop dedicated to bows for stringed instruments. My curiosity is piqued: I take a wildcard steep side street and end up in a blossomy park. The chime of a bell leads me to the cathedral and I’m full of the wonder of holiday-style mooching and the healthy perspective that comes from drinking in all walks of life. When I get home, I excitedly log on to CityStrides. Twenty-three streets! Out of 4,668. I know Bristol 0.48% better and I’m looking forward to doing a little celebratory dance when I reach 1%.

5/4/2022,"Jesus Figueroa Cacho, a certified nursing assistant of the Sacramento, California area, has worked in the nursing home industry for about 25 years. She consistently works 16 hour long shifts, 60 to 80 hours per week, often working through breaks and not getting paid overtime because her employer she works night shifts and overtime accrual resets at 1am every day, in the middle of her shifts. Figueroa Cacho said her facility is severely understaffed, often with just two nurses to care for around 50 patients. “I come home exhausted, I have to drive 40 miles to come to work. This is by choice because I love my residents, I love my work, but I have two hours just to get home, and have very little time to sleep before I have to get right back to work,” said Figueroa Cacho. During the Covid-19 pandemic, her employer had staffing help from the National Guard and staffing agencies, but that contributed to many workers quitting as they were paid much more than permanent staff, who receive just above minimum wage. “We would like to address poverty level wages. If I don’t work 16 hour shifts, I can’t pay my rent,” said Figueroa Cacho. “I have a son in college. My son was denied last semester because I didn’t have enough funds to pay for his school. This is devastating. We need to be paid for our work.” Now the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 2015, which represents 400,000 nursing home and home care workers in California, the largest long-term care union in the US, is advocating for a proposal to create a statewide Quality Standards Board to oversee the state’s nursing home industry in the wake of the pandemic that has decimated staffing in the industry. The board would include 16 seats, with 10 seats from state agencies, two workers, two seats representing advocates and families, and two representing employers. The board will have authority to set minimum standards for wages, benefits and working conditions for the nursing home industry in California. It follows similar pushes to establish industry oversight boards with worker representation in the fast food industry in California and the nail salon industry in New York. According to April Verrett, president of SEIU Local 2015, the board, which was proposed by the union with California state senator Henry Stern and assembly member Miguel Santiago, is being advocated for inclusion in the next California state budget, which is currently undergoing hearings in the state legislature before the next fiscal year begins on 1 July. “Our members are wanting to make sure that we address a long standing crisis in our state’s nursing homes as it relates to making sure the quality of care is what residents in the facilities deserve, that families can count on, and that we once and for all get to the root cause of why people leave this industry,” said Verrett. Verrett added: “They want to make sure that as we approach how we fix this crisis, workers have a seat at the table so they’re able to be a part of creating real solutions so we have a long-term care system that provides the highest quality care for residents, but also ensures that the workforce receives the dignity, respect and the compensation they deserve.” A poll conducted by the union of workers in the nursing home industry found half of nursing home workers are likely to leave their job within the next year, citing severe staffing shortages and low pay. In 2020, there was a turnover rate of over 50% in California’s nursing home industry. The skilled nursing industry in the US has lost 241,000 jobs since the pandemic began, 15.2% of the industry’s total workforce, During the pandemic, nursing homes were among the hardest hit by infections and deaths for residents and workers, accounting for 31% of all Covid deaths in the US as of 30 June 2021. According to SEIU Local 2015, over 82,000 nursing home workers in California contracted Covid-19 during the pandemic, and 247 workers passed away. “The Quality Standards Board is one of the best things for a longtime coming because it gives ordinary workers an opportunity to sit on such a board who has real life experience in what happens in these fields,” said Robert Oriona, a nursing home worker in the Los Angeles, California, area. Oriona noted his nephew makes more than he does working in fast food, and his employer has offered measly wage increase proposals of 1.5% that will be canceled out when the minimum wage in Los Angeles increases in July 2022 to about $16 an hour. He also frequently experiences verbal and physical abuse from residents who don’t have enough staff to properly care for them, faulty equipment, and poor benefits. “We’re asking for help. Patient minimums, better wages, better benefits, and we need everyone out there to know what goes on in these facilities,” added Oriona. Charisma Elok, a rehab assistant for seven years at a nursing home in the Los Angeles area, cited that staff at her facility has dwindled during the pandemic, amid Covid outbreaks, low pay, and short staffing She had to fight to be paid after contracting Covid on the job early on in the pandemic, has worked with inadequate personal protective equipment, and that her facility often can’t handle the number or type of patients they admit due to understaffing and not having the properly trained staff to care for patients with high needs, such as residents suffering from dementia or Alzheimer’s. “These nursing homes, they look at patients as dollar signs on their head, because why are you accepting a patient that you cannot provide adequate quality of care for?” said Elok.",News/Society,‘A longstanding crisis’: California workers fight to reform nursing homes ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/04/california-nursing-homes-union-reform
5/4/2022,"The oil and gas industry wants to play a word-and-picture association game with you. Think of four images: a brightly-colored backpack stuffed with pencils, a smiling teacher with a tablet tucked under her arm, a pair of glasses resting on a stack of pastel notebooks, and a gleaming school bus welcoming a young student aboard. “What do all of these have in common?” an April 6 Facebook post by the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association (NMOGA), asked. “They are powered by oil and natural gas!” Here in New Mexico – the fastest-warming and most water-stressed state in the continental US, where wildfires have recently devoured over 120,000 acres and remain uncontained – the oil and gas industry is coming out in force to deepen the region’s dependence on fossil fuels. Their latest tactic: to position oil and gas as a patron saint of education. Powerful interest groups have deployed a months-long campaign to depict schools and children’s wellbeing as under threat if government officials infringe upon fossil fuel production. In a video spot exemplary of this strategy, Ashley Niman, a fourth grade teacher at Enchanted Hills elementary school tells viewers that the industry is what enables her to do her job. “Without oil and gas, we would not have the resources to provide an exemplary education for our students,” she says. “The partnership we have with the oil and gas industry makes me a better teacher.” The video, from September last year, is part of a PR campaign by NMOGA called “Safer and Stronger”. It’s one of many similar strategies the Guardian tracked across social media, television, and audio formats that employs a rhetorical strategy social scientists refer to as the “fossil fuel savior frame”. “What NMOGA and the oil and gas industry are saying is that we hold New Mexico’s public education system hostage to our profit-motivated interests,” said Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, executive director of the Western Environmental Law Center. “There’s an implied threat there.” Last year, New Mexico brought in $1.1bn from mineral leasing on federal lands – more than any other US state. But the tides may be turning for the fossil fuel industry as officials grapple with the need to halve greenhouse gas emissions this decade. Prior mid-April, the Biden administration had paused all new oil and gas leasing and the number of drilling permits on public lands plummeted. In response, pro-industry groups are pushing out what some experts have called “sky is falling” messaging that generates the impression that without oil and gas revenue, the state’s education system is on a chopping block. NMOGA did not respond for comment. Since February, NMOGA has flooded its social media pages with school-related motifs like buses and books, but also with images of empty, abandoned classrooms accompanied by reminders about how the state’s schools “rely on oil and gas production on federal land for more than $700m in funding”. Elected officials have parroted this framing. “This is a matter of critical importance to all, but especially to New Mexico’s schoolchildren, who have suffered greatly during the pandemic,” state representative Yvette Herrell co-wrote in the Santa Fe New Mexican, in February. But tax, budget and public education funding experts say linking the federal leasing pause to a grave, immediate risk to public education is deceptive. “Any slight reductions stemming from pauses or other so-called ‘adverse’ actions would have zero immediate effect on school funding overall, much less whether students get the services they need to recover from the ill effects on their learning from the pandemic,” said Charles Goodmacher, former government and media relations director at the National Education Association (NEA), now a consultant. The sale of leases does not lead to immediate drilling, he said. Often, companies sit on leases for months or years before production occurs. And as it happens, New Mexico currently has a budget surplus from record production. Industry attempts to convince New Mexicans that the state’s public education system is wholly dependent on oil and gas are based on a tough truth: decades of steep tax cuts have indeed positioned fossil fuels as the thunder behind Democratic-led New Mexico’s economy. In 2021, 15% of the state’s general fund came from royalties, rents and other fees that the Department of Interior collects from mineral extraction on federal lands. Oil and gas activity across federal, state and private lands contributes around a third of the state’s general fund of $7.2bn, as well as a third of its education budget. Commissioner of public lands Stephanie Garcia Richard, herself a former classroom teacher, has been at the forefront of efforts to diversify the New Mexican economy since she was elected to manage the state’s 13m acres of public lands in 2018. “When I ran, in my first campaign, we talked a lot about how a school teacher really understands what every dime that this office makes means to a classroom.” Garcia Richard takes pride in being the first woman, Latina and teacher to have been elected to head the office, which oversees around $1b in revenue generation each year. Since 2019, she’s launched a renewable energy office and outdoor recreation office to raise money from those activities, though Garcia Richard doesn’t believe that money will ever fully make up for oil and gas revenue. “I don’t want anybody ever to think that I have some notion that the revenue diversification strategies we’re pursuing right now somehow make a billion dollars.” New Mexico attorney general Hector Balderas, a Democrat, is another top state official charged with managing the state’s energy and economic transition. Given the same geographic features that make New Mexico the “land of enchantment,” the state is positioned to become a national leader in solar energy, Balderas said. But four of the state’s major solar farms are severely behind schedule. Balderas, who has accepted $49,900 in campaign contributions from oil and gas over seven election cycles, said that a sudden disruption in new oil and gas leasing such as the blanket moratorium the Biden administration originally proposed in January last year, would have an outsized impact on New Mexico’s most vulnerable. “You would cut out nearly a third of the revenue that we rely on to fund our schools and our roads and our law enforcement community,” he said. “I don’t think environmental activists really think about that perspective: how progressives have cleaner air but then thrust original Americans like Native American pueblos into further economic poverty.” Some on the receiving end of oil and gas revenue stress that not all educators and students embrace fossil fuel industry money in public schools. Mary Bissell is an algebra teacher at Cleveland high school in Rio Rancho, who co-signed a letter in November, along with more than 200 educators, asking NMOGA to “stop using New Mexico’s teachers and kids as excuses for more oil and gas development”. Bissell says in spite of how cash-strapped schools may be, many of her colleagues don’t want oil and gas’ money. “I’m not going to teach my kids how to find slope based on fracking,” she said of her math courses. Bissel characterized NMOGA’s attempt to portray educators as a unified force beholden to oil and gas funding as “disgusting.” In some states, including Rhode Island and Massachusetts, state attorneys general have taken it upon themselves, as the leading law enforcement and consumer protection officials, to sue oil and gas companies for deceiving consumers and investors about climate change through their marketing. Balderas’s office said it is not actively pursuing that strategy at this time. Seneca Johnson, 20, a student leader with Youth United for Climate Action (Yucca), is from the Muscogee Nation of Oklahoma. Johnson grew up in New Mexico, and knows first hand about the state’s underfunded schools. “I remember in elementary school we would have a list: bring three boxes of tissues, or colored pencils,” she said, speaking of Chaparral elementary school in Santa Fe. “As students and as teachers, [you’re] buying the supplies for the classroom.” Johnson remembers being told as a child that the schools she attended ranked second worst in the nation. If New Mexico’s education system is indeed that bad, she said, how can officials continue to think that accepting a funding structure that delivers such a consistently poor result is a good idea? “At the end of the day the system that we have now that is being paid for by oil and gas doesn’t work, and we know it doesn’t work,” Johnson said. “It’s the whole ‘Don’t bite the hand that feeds you’ kind of mentality,” she said, linking the industry’s patronizing messaging around its support for schools to a direct legacy of colonization. “I don’t want to have to rely on this outside entity. I don’t want to have to rely on this broken system. I want better for my kids and their kids and my whole community.” This story is published as part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of news outlets strengthening coverage of the climate story",News/Environment,How the oil and gas industry is trying to hold US public schools hostage,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/04/oil-and-gas-industry-us-public-schools
5/4/2022,"The culinary robots are here. Not only to distinguish between food which tastes good and which doesn’t, but also to become better cooks. A robot chef designed by researchers at Cambridge University has been trained to taste a dish’s saltiness and the myriad of ingredients at different stages of chewing – a process imitating that of humans. It is a step above current electronic testing that only provides a snapshot of a food’s salinity. Replicating the human process, researchers say, should result in a tastier end product. “If robots are to be used for certain aspects of food preparation, it’s important that they are able to ‘taste’ what they’re cooking,” said Grzegorz Sochacki, one of the researchers, from Cambridge’s department of engineering. The concept of tasting as you go – checking whether the balance of flavours is right in a dish’s cooking process – is a critical approach, according to researchers, as the human perception of taste relies on saliva produced during chewing and digestive enzymes to decide whether food is enjoyable or not. To map human taste, the researchers trained the robot chef to make omelettes. It then tasted nine variations of scrambled egg and tomatoes at three stages of the chewing process. A salinity sensor attached to the robot’s arm provided readings as the robot prepared dishes. To imitate the chewing progress, the team blended the egg mixture and had the robot test the dish again. Sochacki says it can do much more than just say a dish is too salty, or not salty enough – for example, it is capable of deciding whether more mixing is needed, or other ingredients. “In the end it’s just a single sensor which wouldn’t be able to do two different ingredients normally,” Sochacki told the BBC. “But thanks to chewing, we see all the different changes through mechanical processing.” The robotic arms looked similar to those in a car factory, Sochacki told Radio 4’s Today programme, but were made smaller and more affordable to be used in a variety of kitchens, such as at chain restaurants. But was the robot able to help out with the cooking at home too? “It’s definitely possible, but that’s probably a few years away,” Sochacki said. Looking ahead, the researchers hope to teach the robot to adapt to an individual’s tastes – such as preferring sweet or oily food – and become an essential part of households. Dr Muhammad Chughtai, a senior scientist at the domestic appliances manufacturer Beko, who worked with the Cambridge University researchers, believes the technology will play a major role in homes in the future. “This result is a leap forward in robotic cooking, and by using machine- and deep-learning algorithms, mastication will help robot chefs adjust taste for different dishes and users,” he said.",News/Technology,R2-D-Chew: robot chef imitates human eating process to create tastier food,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/04/robot-chef-imitates-human-chewing-process-create-tastier-food
5/4/2022,"Keir Starmer has confirmed that Durham police have not contacted him about drinking a beer and eating a takeaway with staff in a constituency office last year, as he said he was always “very careful” to abide by lockdown rules. The Labour leader gave his first full explanation of what happened on the night in April last year, after days of coverage from the Daily Mail and Conservatives MPs urging police to look into the incident. Asked whether the police had been in touch with him, Starmer said: “No, I think they put out a statement last week saying they’re not reinvestigating and they haven’t spoken to me.” He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain there was no breach of the rules when he shared a meal with staff after campaigning and while they were working late. “We’re on the road. At the end of the day we’re in the office preparing,” he said. “Now that evening, from memory we were doing an online event for members … At some point, this was in the evening, everybody’s hungry and a takeaway was ordered. “It was then delivered to the kitchen of the offices … In Durham, all restaurants and pubs were closed, so takeaways really were the only way you could eat. So this was brought in and at various points people went through to the kitchen and had something to eat, and got on with their work.” He added:“We were very careful to abide by the rules … and we did it within my family. My wife’s father is very elderly and had to shield in difficult circumstances that I won’t go into. My wife went and sat on the pavement outside his house. All she wanted to do, like many families, is she wanted to go in and clean and she didn’t because the rules didn’t allow her. So I know what that feels like.” Starmer has previously accused the Tories of “mudslinging” over their allegations that he broke Covid rules, in order to distract from the prime minister’s own law-breaking, for which he was issued a fixed-penalty notice. Johnson paid a fine for attending his birthday party in June 2020, and is still under investigation over his alleged attendance at several other parties. Footage emerged of the Labour leader drinking a beer with colleagues in April 2021 while coronavirus restrictions were in place. In February, Durham police confirmed they did not believe any offence had been committed. A spokesperson for the force said at the time: “Durham constabulary has reviewed video footage recorded in Durham on 30 April 2021. We do not believe an offence has been established in relation to the legislation and guidance in place at that time and will therefore take no further action in relation to this matter.” The force subsequently confirmed it was not reinvestigating.",News/Politics,Keir Starmer says police have not contacted him about office beer ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/04/keir-starmer-says-police-have-not-contacted-him-about-meal-in-durham
5/4/2022,"The soldier who discovered the infamous tunnel in Whiskey 108 says there were no fighting-aged males hiding inside, backing Ben Roberts-Smith’s version of events of a fiercely contested mission in Afghanistan, the federal court has heard. Roberts-Smith’s fourth soldier witness, a still-serving warrant officer anonymised as Person 29, gave evidence on Wednesday about a 2009 SAS raid on a compound known as Whiskey 108 in the village of Kakarak – an insurgent redoubt in Afghanistan’s southern Uruzgan province. Person 29, a former comrade of Roberts-Smith and godfather to one of his children, was the soldier who discovered the crude, hand-dug tunnel, underneath a grate and hidden beneath grass as troops were working to clear the compound of threats. The tunnel, and what was in it, is critical to two murder allegations against Roberts-Smith made by the newspapers defending Roberts-Smith’s defamation claim. Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. Person 29 said after he discovered the tunnel, Roberts-Smith’s offer to climb inside it was rejected because he was too tall. A smaller Australian soldier, Person 35, was sent down the tunnel to clear it. He removed his body armour and drew his pistol to crawl into the tiny space. It took about “30 seconds” to clear the tunnel, Person 29 told the court. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Did any fighting-age males come out of the tunnel?” Roberts-Smith’s barrister, Arthur Moses SC, asked Person 29 on Wednesday. “No,” he replied. The discovery of the tunnel is not contested, but two irreconcilable versions of events have emerged in court about what was found inside. Roberts-Smith has repeatedly told the court the tunnel contained a cache of arms but no people. Four times during his evidence to the court, Roberts-Smith told Justice Anthony Besanko “there were no men in the tunnel” or “there were no people in the tunnel”. He has now been backed by three of his soldier witnesses. But five other Australian SAS soldiers, called to give evidence by the newspapers, have told the court they saw men pulled from the tunnel. A soldier known as Person 42 told the court the men “were compliant … they came out unarmed, they came out freely, relatively quickly once given commands – the ‘hands up’ order”. The presence of those men, or otherwise, is key because of what is alleged to have happened next. The newspapers claim the two men pulled from the tunnel were murdered: one, a disabled man with a prosthetic leg, was allegedly machine-gunned by Roberts-Smith himself, his leg later taken as a souvenir by another soldier as a ghoulish trophy of war, a drinking vessel for celebrating soldiers. The other person, an elderly man, was allegedly executed by another soldier on Roberts-Smith’s orders – a “blooding” of a new trooper. Roberts-Smith denies either killing ever happened as alleged, and argues they could never have happened because there was never anybody in the tunnel. He said he killed the man with a prosthetic leg, whom he discovered running and armed, outside the compound. The man was an insurgent, lawfully killed within the laws of war, Roberts-Smith says. The elderly man, according to Roberts-Smith, was killed by another Australian soldier, unknown to him, but whom he credits with saving his life. Person 29 remains in the witness box. The trial continues.",News/Australia news,"Witness agrees with Ben Roberts-Smith that no fighting-aged men were inside tunnel, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/04/witness-agrees-with-ben-robert-smith-that-no-fighting-aged-men-were-inside-tunnel-court-hears
5/4/2022,"Shoppers can deal with soaring food prices and cope with the cost of living crisis by choosing value brands in the supermarket, the environment secretary has suggested. George Eustice, the cabinet minister overseeing food and farming, told Sky News food prices were going up because of the knock-on effect of higher energy costs, pushing up fertiliser and feed costs. He said: “Generally speaking, what people find is by going for some of the value brands rather than own-branded products – they can actually contain and manage their household budget. “It will undoubtedly put a pressure on household budgets and, of course, it comes on top of those high gas prices as well.” He argued there was a “very, very competitive retail market with 10 big supermarkets and the four main ones competing very aggressively, particularly on some of the lower-cost, everyday value items for households, so things like spaghetti and ambient products – there’s a lot of competition to keep those prices down”. “Where it gets harder is on things like chicken and poultry, and some fresh produce, where those increased feed costs do end up getting passed through the system because these people work on wafer-thin margins and they have to pass that cost through,” Eustice added. He also suggested that Elsie, the 77-year-old woman who said she was riding buses to keep warm, should go to her local council for help. Boris Johnson has previously drawn criticism for boasting about having brought in free bus passes when confronted with the story of her struggles to heat her home. Eustice told Sky News: “What would my advice be to Elsa (sic)? Well, my advice would be that, you know, not to stay on a bus all day to try and stay warm. My advice would be to seek some support from the local authority.” Pat McFadden, a shadow Treasury minister, criticised Eustice’s comments as “woefully out of touch from a government with no solution to the cost-of-living crisis facing working people”. “People are seeing their wages fall, fuel and food costs rise, and families are worried about how to make ends meet,” he said. “It’s time for the government to get real help to people rather than comments that simply expose how little they understand about the real struggles people are facing to pay their bills.” The Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesperson, Wendy Chamberlain, said: “These comments show George Eustice and the Conservatives are living in a parallel universe. Families and pensioners who can’t afford their weekly shop need more help, not patronising advice from a clueless minister. “This is the stark reality of Boris Johnson’s Britain. Oil and gas giants are raking in billions, while families are told to buy value food and pensioners are riding around on buses to keep warm.”",News/Business,"Britons should buy value brands to cope with living cost crisis, says minister",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/britons-should-buy-value-brands-to-cope-with-living-cost-crisis-says-minister
5/4/2022,"Ursula von der Leyen has proposed a total ban on Russian oil imports to the EU, , saying Vladimir Putin had to pay a “high price for his brutal aggression” in Ukraine. Member states in Brussels are scrutinising a proposed sixth package of sanctions, but in a speech on Wednesday the European Commission president said Russian oil flows had to stop. Von der Leyen said Russian supply of crude oil would be prohibited within six months and refined products would be banned by the end of the year, while she acknowledged the demands from countries such as Slovakia and Hungary for additional flexibility. “Let us be clear: it will not be easy,” Von der Leyen said in a speech to the European parliament. “Some member states are strongly dependent on Russian oil. But we simply have to work on it. We now propose a ban on Russian oil. This will be a complete import ban on all Russian oil, seaborne and pipeline, crude and refined. “We will make sure that we phase out Russian oil in an orderly fashion, in a way that allows us and our partners to secure alternative supply routes and minimises the impact on global markets.” Russian imports account for 25% of oil imports to the EU and are a major source of revenue for the Kremlin but the level of dependency varies and Slovakian and Hungarian ministers have already said they will seek exemptions from the proposals. The sanctions package will require unanimous support from the EU member states whose representatives in Brussels have already started to pore over the details with the hope of coming to an agreement by the end of the week. As Von der Leyen sought to rally the EU to take the next step, she littered her speech with the names of Ukrainian cities and towns that had been subject to brutal Russian bombardments or where evidence of war crimes had been uncovered. She told MEPs the EU should additionally target military figures involved in the massacre of civilians in the town of Bucha, north of Kyiv, and siege of the port city of Mariupol with restrictive measures, and block Russian state television from being broadcast in the 27 member states. “This sends another important signal to all perpetrators of the Kremlin’s war: we know who you are, and you will be held accountable,” she said. “With all these steps, we are depriving the Russian economy of its ability to diversify and modernise.” The EU would also remove Sberbank – Russia’s largest bank – and two other major banks from the Swift payment system, under the last sanctions package. “Putin wanted to wipe Ukraine from the map. He will clearly not succeed,” she said. “On the contrary, Ukraine has risen up in unity. And it is his own country, Russia, he is sinking.” The EU is preparing to be the main funder of Ukraine’s economic recovery from the war, with billions already committed, but Von der Leyen called on the US and others to match those funds. Ukraine’s GDP was expected to fall by 30% to 50% this year alone, she said, with the IMF estimating that Ukraine would require €5bn a month “to keep the country running, paying pensions, salaries and basic services”. “We have to support them, but we cannot do it alone,” Von der Leyen said. “I welcome that the United States announced massive budgetary support. And we, as Team Europe, will also do our share.” She went on: “Europe has a very special responsibility towards Ukraine. With our support, Ukrainians can rebuild their country for the next generation. “That is why today I am proposing to you that we start working on an ambitious recovery package for our Ukrainian friends. This package should bring massive investment to meet the needs and the necessary reforms. It should address the existing weaknesses of the Ukrainian economy and lay the foundations for sustainable long-term growth.”",News/World news,Ursula von der Leyen says Putin must pay ‘high price’ as she proposes oil ban,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/04/ursula-von-der-leyen-says-putin-must-pay-high-price-as-she-proposes-oil-ban
5/4/2022,"Scott Morrison has not spoken with the prime minister of Solomon Islands since the Australian election campaign began but insists he wants to put the countries’ relationship back on a positive footing. The Australian prime minister made the remarks on Wednesday, a day after his Pacific island counterpart Manasseh Sogavare launched a thinly veiled criticism of some politicians’ language about Solomon Islands in the wake of the controversial security agreement with China. Sogavare said Solomon Islands was charting a course “as an independent sovereign nation” and should not be seen as “tucked away in the back yard of some countries”. Sogavare did not name any individuals, but the home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, is among a number of Australian politicians to have said Australia was “very concerned about anything that is happening in our back yard in the Pacific region”. Labor frontbencher Bill Shorten has also previously accused the Australian government of “a major foreign policy blunder” and said that “when we’ve got these sorts of agreements being signed in our back yard, that’s the day job of the Morrison government”. Pacific island countries have long objected to the notion that they are in the back yard of larger regional powers. “That term is offensive to us,” Sogavare told parliament in Honiara on Tuesday. “In custom, back yard is where the toilet is. It is where pig and chicken pens are located. It is where rubbish are collected and burned … It is an area of the house where we relieve ourselves. “I call on those people who continue to brand us as their back yard to stop calling us that name and start to respect us as a sovereign independent nation with one equal vote in the United Nations.” The personal relationship between Sogavare and Morrison is clearly strained, following confirmation in the early stages of the Australian election campaign that Solomon Islands had signed the security agreement with China. Last week, Sogavare accused the Australian government of hypocrisy in criticising the secrecy around that deal, suggesting Australia, the US and the UK had not been upfront with Pacific island countries about the Aukus plans. That prompted Morrison to tell reporters the positions of the Solomon Islands’ and Chinese governments were now “remarkably similar”. Morrison was asked on Wednesday to describe any recent conversations with Sogavare. “I have had no discussions with him since the election was called and from since he’s made those comments,” Morrison said. “I’d be looking forward to the opportunity on the other side of the election to continue to manage that relationship positively.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Despite the finalisation of the new security agreement with China, Morrison said Australia remained “Solomon Islands’ primary security partner”. Pressed on the accusation that Sogavare was parroting Beijing’s words, Morrison said: “That was others’ commentary. They were not my words.” While it is true Morrison did not use that form of words, he did not contradict the suggestion when asked by a journalist on Friday. Morrison said he had spoken with Sogavare the day after the Aukus announcement in September 2021, as part of a round of calls with many leaders briefing them on what had been negotiated. “I did have that conversation with the prime minister [Sogavare] the day following the announcement, and no issues were raised at that time in that discussion,” Morrison told reporters in Tasmania on Friday. “But obviously, as time goes on and new relationships are entered into, there’s obviously been some clearly other influences in the perspective taken by the Solomon Islands prime minister. Now, I understand that.” When a journalist asked whether Morrison was saying Sogavare was parroting China’s rhetoric, the Australian prime minister replied: “There’s a remarkable similarity between those statements and those of the Chinese government.” Sogavare used his most recent address to parliament to reiterate that countries “have nothing to be concerned about” regarding the security agreement with China. “We deplore the continual demonstration of lack of trust by the concerned parties and attaching a warning of military intervention in Solomon Islands if their national and strategic interests is undermined in Solomon Islands,” Sogavare said on Tuesday. He also repeated the claim, denied by Canberra, that Australia had refused to allow its police and defence force personnel to protect Chinese-built infrastructure and the Chinese embassy during last year’s unrest in Honiara. He also accused Australian media of “deliberately feeding misinformation to its population”.
