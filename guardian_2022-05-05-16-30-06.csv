5/5/2022,"The family of a north Queensland mother missing in Mexico, whose two-year-old daughter, Adelynn, was found alone at a Cancún church, are pleading with authorities to help swiftly bring the child to Australia. Tahnee Shanks, 32, was last seen in the Yucatan peninsula resort town on Monday, where she was holidaying with her Mexican partner and Adelynn’s father, Jorge Aguirre Estudillo, who is also reportedly missing. Her brother Ben and mother, Leanne, will travel to Mexico on Friday to try to take custody of her child and bring her to Australia. The family say Adelynn is being cared for by a family services organisation. “They’ll be going straight to get Addy, and then straight to the embassy to get her passport sorted, and then straight to the police station to start helping to find Tahnee,” Dan Shanks, Adelynn’s uncle, said. “Addy and my mother will be flying home immediately, as soon as they can, and my brother will be staying behind to assist police.” He said the family was offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to his sister’s safe return. Tahnee Shanks, who grew up in Conway Beach on the Whitsundays, is a Mexican citizen and has been living in the North American country for several years. Her family say she had been trying to return home, but those plans had been derailed by Covid-19 and other complications. “Tahnee just wanted to come home,” Shanks said. “She was homesick and she wanted to see her family.” In a post on her Facebook account last May, Tahnee Shanks expressed her frustration that border closures would not allow her to come back to Australia until mid-2022. “My baby girl will be 2 1/2 years old and hasn’t even met her grandad, uncles, great gran, cousins,” she wrote. Shanks said he spoke to a Mexican police officer who was investigating his sister’s disappearance on Thursday, with Tahnee’s paediatrician acting as an interpreter. He said police had found what they believed to be the vehicle the family had been travelling in. “It’s a white Toyota Tundra and apparently they are quite rare in Cancún … and it was found near the church where Addy was dumped,” he said.

Friends say she is “adventurous and fun”. “She had a daughter and then her whole life became about her daughter,” one said. “She never left her daughter’s side.”",News/Australia news,Fears for Queensland mother in Mexico after her daughter was found wandering alone at a church,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/fears-for-queensland-mother-in-mexico-after-her-daughter-was-found-wandering-alone-at-a-church
5/5/2022,"Making a big difference is often the summation of a series of small steps and the all-female W Series is putting its best foot forward as the new season opens on the Formula One bill in Miami this weekend. The drivers are, of course, pursuing individual ambitions but in so doing this generation of women are breaking the ground for the real change that is to come. The W Series held its first season in 2019, a concerted effort to address the paucity of female drivers in motor sport. F1 has not had a woman compete at a grand prix since Lella Lombardi raced in Austria in 1976. The stated goal of W Series was to address that deficit. The series embraced radical ideas from its inception. It meets the costs of the drivers, who compete in single-make F3 cars, and rewards them with prize money to help their careers. Added to the F1 bill last season, it has been successful in changing perceptions and showcasing the talent of its female protagonists, revitalising the careers of some and opening new doors for others. Yet with season three about to begin, returning a woman to F1 still looks a long way off. This was never going to be easy nor accomplished overnight. Britain’s Sarah Moore is entering her third season in the series and the 28-year-old from Harrogate knows how hard these women are working. They will be racing on the same track as their male F1 counterparts in Miami but their reality could not be further from the gilded privilege of F1’s stars. In 2020, with the W Series cancelled and her driver coaching job impossible because of the pandemic, Moore took to driving a supermarket delivery van to make a living. Even with the return of the series in 2021, there were still bills to be paid so when the racing was over for the weekend, she continued climbing behind the wheel of the van until November last year. Moore is grateful to the W Series for giving her the chance to race but behind the scenes the relentless pursuit of furthering her career grinds on. “We’re chasing the sponsorship side alongside a full-time job which we have to do to provide ourselves with an income to pay our bills,” she explained. “We have to train, eat the right things, it’s a lot of hard work. Sometimes it can be quite draining, it’s also emotional. You get turned down by most people more than you are accepted in terms of sponsorship. It takes a lot to keep fighting.” Moore began karting when she was four and went on to win the Ginetta Junior Championship in 2009. In 2018 she became the first woman to win the Britcar Endurance Championship. She wanted to make it to F1 but accepts that she will not be the driver to do so, yet is confident that the younger generation coming into the series now such as Britain’s Abbi Pulling, the 19-year-old who is already part of the Alpine F1 team’s junior driver affiliate programme, are coming through at the right time. “From W Series I would like to see a woman go on and reach F1,” said Moore. “But for me, I have just wanted to become a professional driver to get paid to do what I enjoy doing.” Moore has already made her mark on one level at least. With a second place in Austria last year, she became the first openly LGBTQ driver to stand on the podium at an F1 race weekend, a moment she is proud of for what it meant for the gay community rather than herself. Other drivers have enjoyed the benefits of showcasing their talents. Most recently Beitske Visser earned a World Endurance Championship drive and Alice Powell has secured new drives, a development job in Formula E and is now a development mentor at Alpine’s academy. The series’ first two seasons were won by Jamie Chadwick, last year after a fierce battle with Powell that went down to the final race. Chadwick was taken on by Williams as a development driver, however that she too is racing on in W Series rather than moving to one of the F1 feeder competitions has led to accusations the series is failing in its objectives. It is an unfair and hasty critique. Chadwick notes the huge costs of securing a drive in either feeder series, F3 or F2. Conservative estimates put a seat in F3 at £650,000 for a season and in F2 at £1.5m. Chadwick is adamant that simply taking any drive just for the sake of it would not do her, or the women who follow her, any favours. “I feel the responsibility in doing the best job in how I approach the next step,” said Chadwick. “So if I go into a completely uncompetitive seat and am underprepared and don’t do a good job I don’t want that to reflect on the W Series.” The series has been a victim of its own success, believes Chadwick, who this season will race for the team backed by the former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner. Such has been its popularity and exposure there has been an expectation that a driver moving on to the next step was a given but that is far from the case. “There is a perception it is the series that will feed you into F1,” said Chadwick. “But you still have to go through F3 and F2 to progress to F1.” Which means Chadwick is knuckling down for another fight this season while attempting to ensure she is also preparing as best she can to step up to F3, and finding the backing to do so, making sure to get the small steps right so racing can make the great leap forward. “For W Series and the credibility of women in the sport we have to do things the right way, like any male driver would,” she said.",Sport/Sport,W Series looks to push accelerator on change as 2022 season kicks off | Giles Richards,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/05/w-series-looks-to-push-accelerator-on-change-as-grid-lines-up-for-2022-season
5/5/2022,"A charity has demanded a Queensland Liberal MP stop using a testimonial in promotional material, saying it did not consent to its use. In a pamphlet titled “What are locals really saying about Trevor Evans”, the MP quotes from three charities – the Pyjama Foundation, Gingercloud Foundation and Arts Access – with the former two also quoted on his website. All three are registered charities and bound by rules that prevent them from advocating for particular political parties or candidates. The material does not explicitly advocate a vote for Evans, but was distributed just weeks out from the 21 May election. In April, the deputy Liberal leader, Josh Frydenberg, was forced to pull an endorsement from the chief executive of Guide Dogs Victoria who was later stood down pending an investigation over the controversy and potential breach of those rules. In Evans’ pamphlet the Pyjama Foundation chief executive, Bronwyn Sheehan, said: “Trevor is seriously supportive of our local community. He takes a keen interest in the work of the Pyjama Foundation and in what we are doing to help support kids in foster care.” In a statement to Guardian Australia, the foundation’s board said it and Sheehan became aware of the promotional material on Tuesday. “The Pyjama Foundation can confirm that the quote in question was sent to the office of Trevor Evans on 8 March 2022 in response to a request for it to be used as part of a community newsletter in relation to a local partnership,” the statement said. “Neither Bronwyn Sheehan, nor the board of The Pyjama Foundation consented to the use of the quote in recently distributed material, delivered this week.” The foundation said it was “acutely aware of our obligations as a registered charity and we do not endorse or oppose any political parties or candidates”. “Our consent would not have been provided for the material publication, if we had been contacted.” The foundation has contacted Evans asking that he “cease the distribution of any further promotional collateral that features CEO and founder, Bronwyn Sheehan”. Looks like possibly more unauthorised use of charities in electioneering material. This time it’s LNP Trevor Evans, MP for Brisbane.A friend of mine contacted one of the CEOs on the flyer and they were surprised and genuinely concerned they were used in this material. pic.twitter.com/3iwNynYWiR Megan Elliott, from the Gingercloud Foundation, is also featured. “Trevor backs up his supportive words with real outcomes, and that’s so important to Gingercloud. He is the real deal and he is very hard working,” part of her testimonial said. When contacted by Guardian Australia on Thursday, Elliott seemed unaware her testimonial had been used in Evans’ campaign material. After she had been supplied a copy, Elliott told Guardian Australia the “supporting words for Trevor were not partisan”, but declined to answer follow-up questions about whether she knew the testimonial would be used in this way. “They just recognise his support for the work that we do for young people with autism and other learning and perceptual disabilities,” she said. “We always recognise the support we get from all levels of government.” In a third testimonial, Pat Swell, from Arts Access described Evans as an “exceptional MP”. “Trevor’s obvious interest in our people and the exceptional opportunities he has created for Access Arts is impressive and says so much about him. I am truly impressed,” the testimonial said. A spokesperson for Arts Access said: “I don’t know how he got the testimonial.” “Normally we try to remain apolitical,” they said. The endorsements could breach the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) rules around advocacy and campaigning if it promotes “a political party or a candidate for political office”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The ACNC declined to comment on the Evans testimonials, but noted in April it reminded charities “to be aware of their obligations regarding political advocacy and campaigning”. The ACNC advice says charities can engage in “advocacy or campaigning” if those activities further their charitable purpose, or are allowed under the charity’s governing document but advocacy “must not” promote or oppose a political party or candidate for office. The ACNC commissioner, Gary Johns, said: “While advocacy and campaigning are important to the work that many of Australia’s registered charities undertake, and are legitimate and effective ways of furthering a charitable purpose, it is important to note there are lines that should not be crossed.” Evans defended his use of the testimonials. “Hard-working members of parliament who get lots of outcomes for their community often receive supportive comments that recognise that work,” he said.",News/Australia news,Liberal MP uses charity’s testimonial on flyer distributed during election campaign without its consent,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/liberal-mp-uses-charitys-testimonial-on-flyer-distributed-during-election-campaign-without-its-consent
5/5/2022,"Mohamed Salah has said Liverpool have a “score to settle” with Real Madrid after the Spanish side set up a repeat of their 2018 Champions League final by securing a comeback win against Manchester City. Salah left the field in tears in the final four years ago after a heavy fall under a challenge by Sergio Ramos, with Real going on to clinch the title with a 3-1 victory. “We have a score to settle,” Salah posted on social media after Real eliminated City 6-5 on aggregate. Liverpool claimed their place in the final with a 5-2 aggregate win against Villarreal on Tuesday, with Salah saying that he was eager to face Real again. “I want to play Madrid,” the forward told BT Sport. “We lost in the final against them, so I want to play against them and hopefully win it from them as well.” Liverpool, who trail City by a point in the Premier League, host Tottenham on Saturday. City play at home to Newcastle on Sunday and Pep Guardiola has said his players will need time to come to terms with their fate after Madrid’s dramatic late recovery to knock them out. “We need one or two days but we will rise, we will come up,” City’s manager said. “We will have do so, with our people. We did everything we could. We were really, really close but in the end we could not do it.” Asked whether this was his hardest European night as a coach, Guardiola replied: “I have had bad defeats in the Champions League before. [Such as] Barcelona against Chelsea when we played two exceptional games and couldn’t make the final. But, yeah, it’s tough. We can’t deny it.”",Sport/Football,Mohamed Salah admits Liverpool have ‘score to settle’ against Real Madrid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/05/mohamed-salah-liverpool-have-score-to-settle-against-real-madrid-champions-league-final
5/5/2022,"What if the afterlife is no glamorous inferno, celestial paradise or reincarnation lottery but a bureaucratic nightmare, overfull and under-resourced, where you remember your death but have a second one to look forward to after a fresh round of ageing and disease? Worst of all, what if you had to get a job there – manufacturing umbrellas, say – in order to pay for basic goods and drink away your woes as it dawns on you that nobody in this realm knows what’s going on? Steve Toltz’s fabulously impressive third novel, following the 2008 Booker-shortlisted A Fraction of the Whole and 2015’s Quicksand, cannonballs straight into heady existential questions, magicking up a vision of human life at once generous and absurd while wearing its considerable ambition lightly. Very lightly. A few pages in, realising that the story is told in a compulsively jokey, determined-to-impress voice with even the dialogue consisting entirely of well-timed one-liners and off-the-cuff aphorisms, I groaned: “Oh Christ – 400 pages.” But a headstrong novelist sets the parameters of their own realism, and soon the style clicked. Once it did, I struggled to keep track of how much there was to admire in Toltz’s relentlessly lively sentences, offbeat insights and unfaltering narrative energy. Like Kevin Spacey’s character at the start of American Beauty, our narrator Angus Mooney announces straight off the bat that he is dead. He finds this condition acutely embarrassing, having in life “put all my eggs in the basket of bodily death and personality extinction” only to find himself rudely awakened in an affrontingly mundane hereafter. Angus’s pre-death human career was not distinguished: brought up by foster parents, he fell into petty crime and substance abuse but cleaned up his act and found love in his early 40s with Gracie. A wilful and opinionated woman with new age tendencies, you’d call her a force of nature if it weren’t for her addiction to virtual life: “She couldn’t put down her fucking phone. And, worse, my wife had a ‘social media presence’.” Very online Gracie emotes, opines and aphorises (“I believe the only thing worse than being sexually objectified is not being sexually objectified”) while promoting her business as a marriage celebrant, paid to make subversively candid speeches at weddings. Later in the novel, she will also give speeches at births and then, as a far worse pandemic than Covid-19 tears across the planet, at ritual suicides, paying tribute to the human race. These caustically comic disquisitions give Toltz a platform for Swiftian state-of-the-species appraisals. “We declared moral bankruptcy and kept on spending!” “Admit it. We were only at our best when we were on MDMA.” In interviews, Toltz has namechecked such leading miserabilists as the aphorist EM Cioran and the misanthrope’s misanthrope Thomas Bernhard, while one of Here Goes Nothing’s epigraphs is from the more obscure Peter Wessel Zapffe, who took philosophical pessimism to its death-metal extreme. An engagement with the great “No” to life is clearly part of his intellectual apparatus, but Toltz is too much of a humorist to throw his weight fully into naysaying, and raises wisecracking to something like the status of a worldview. After Gracie becomes pregnant, an odious old man named Owen Fogel weasels his way into their home. Owen admits that Hobbes’s description of life as nasty, brutish and short could also describe him as a person. But by the time Angus comes to suspect him of ulterior motives, he’s already being murdered. Getting his bearings in the afterworld, Angus learns that he’s cast up in Lagaria, a “provincial outpost between two medium-sized cities”. In this tawdry parallel dimension, harried volunteers struggle to process the influx of freshly deceased; the hereafter’s strained civic infrastructure calls to mind the refugee crisis to which Toltz’s native Australia has responded with especial callousness. However, though Here Goes Nothing perpetually threatens to commit to allegory, it is better served by the ambiguity it maintains. In alternating chapters, Angus narrates his habituation to Lagaria and keeps pained tabs on Gracie and Owen. The afterlife conceit gives the joker Toltz ample opportunities for ironic reversal and laser-guided quip – “Are you ready?” “I died ready” – while also allowing his first-person narration to transition easefully into third-person omniscience. Drinking at the excellently named bar the Bitter in Soul, the dead struggle to accept their lot: “Dying had brought many of us to the brink of suicide. We were ashamed of our lives and now we were ashamed of our afterlives.” Romantic possibility is a lacklustre mirror to its pre-mortal variant: “Wearying monogamy, empty casual sex, doomed polyamory, unhygienic sex parties, soul-destroying solitude. Even here, there wasn’t a single additional option.” Learning of a backstreet dealer who can arrange interdimensional trips facilitated by DMT injection and immersion in a floatation tank, Angus spends his wages compulsively haunting his former home. These emotionally charged multiverse voyages reminded me of Brit Marling’s sublime Netflix series The OA, though where that show opted for kamikaze earnestness, Toltz’s comic yet gnostic vision echoes Milan Kundera’s ambition for the novel: “To bring together the extreme gravity of the question and the extreme lightness of the form.” Toltz takes his time with each book – new ones have appeared at seven-year intervals – and Here Goes Nothing is a funny, clever, entertaining argument in favour of cultivating the patience to get it right.

5/5/2022,"Chief Justice John Roberts has condemned the leak of a draft supreme court opinion overturning Roe v Wade as a “betrayal”. But for the majority of Americans who support the right to abortion access, the true betrayal was committed by the five justices who have initially voted to overturn the landmark case. That is especially true of the three conservative supreme court justices who were nominated by Donald Trump: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. During their Senate confirmation hearings, each of those three justices was asked about Roe and Planned Parenthood v Casey, the 1992 case that upheld the right to abortion access and could now be overturned as well. The comments that the three justices made during those hearings are now coming under renewed scrutiny, as they face accusations of having misled politicians and the public about their willingness to overturn Roe. Republican Senator Susan Collins, who supported Gorsuch and Kavanaugh and repeatedly reassured the public that they would not vote to overturn Roe, has expressed alarm over the draft opinion and a sense that the justices told her something they later reversed. “If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision and this reporting is accurate, it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office,” Collins said, while noting that the draft opinion is not final. Republican Senator Lisa Murkowksi, who also supports abortion rights and voted in favor of Gorsuch’s and Barrett’s nominations, said the draft opinion “rocks my confidence in the court right now”. Murkowski told reporters on Tuesday: “If the decision is going the way that the draft that has been revealed is actually the case, it was not the direction that I believed that the court would take based on statements that have been made about Roe being settled and being precedent.” During his 2017 confirmation hearings, Gorsuch said: “Casey is settled law in the sense that it is a decision of the US supreme court.” When Kavanaugh appeared before the Senate judiciary committee in 2018, he similarly described Roe as “important precedent of the supreme court that has been reaffirmed many times”, and he defined Casy as “precedent on precedent” because it upheld Roe. But legal excerpts say Gorsuch and Kavanaugh’s comments about Roe and Casey did not clearly indicate how they might vote in a case like Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, raising the prospect that some people may have read into their statements only what they wished to hear. “When people are nominated to the supreme court and they testify in Senate confirmation hearings, they are very careful about their language,” said Professor Katherine Franke of Columbia Law School. “Something like ‘settled law’ actually has no concrete legal meaning. What it means is that that’s a decision from the supreme court, and I acknowledge that it exists. But it doesn’t carry any kind of significance beyond that.” During her Senate confirmation hearings, Barrett was arguably even more careful than Gorsuch and Kavanaugh in her language about Roe. She refused to identify Roe as a “superprecedent”, meaning a widely accepted case that is unlikely to be overturned by the court. Instead she promised that, if confirmed, she would abide by “stare decisis”, the legal principle of deciding cases based off precedent. However, Barrett’s writings before joining the supreme court gave a clear indication of her thoughts on Roe. In one 1998 paper, Barrett and her co-author defined abortion as “always immoral” in the view of the Catholic church. She also signed off on a 2006 advertisement that described Roe as “barbaric”. “I’m sure that both Senators Collins and Murkowski asked pointed questions of all of these nominees, trying to get them to clearly say that they would not overrule Roe v Wade,” Franke said. “Murkowski and Collins maybe heard what they wanted to hear in order to feel better about voting to confirm these nominees, when the rest of the world knew quite clearly that they were ideologically and legally opposed to abortion.” For that reason, many progressives expressed little sympathy for Collins and Murkowski as they reacted with bafflement to the draft opinion. “Murkowski voted for Amy Coney Barrett when Trump himself proclaimed that he was appointing justices specifically to overturn Roe,” progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Tuesday. “She and Collins betrayed the nation’s reproductive rights when they were singularly capable of stopping the slide. They don’t get to play victim now.” Murkowski voted for Amy Coney Barrett when Trump himself proclaimed that he was appointing justices specifically to overturn Roe.She and Collins betrayed the nation’s reproductive rights when they were singularly capable of stopping the slide. They don’t get to play victim now https://t.co/6i7b3g08lN Rather than showing remorse, progressives are demanding that Collins and Murkowski take action to protect abortion rights. Both Collins and Murkowski have said they support codifying Roe into law, but that proposal does not have the 60 votes necessary to overcome a Senate filibuster. Progressives are now calling on Collins and Murkowski to support a filibuster carveout to enshrine the protections of Roe into law. “To salvage their legacy, Collins and Murkowski must join with Democratic senators to do whatever is necessary to protect Roe in federal law,” said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. “No meaningful action will happen without a filibuster carveout now.” But Collins and Murkowski have so far given no indication that they would support such a carveout. Unless they do, the court stands ready to overturn nearly 50 years of precedent and erase the national right to abortion access, even though a clear majority of the country would oppose that decision. A CNN poll released earlier this year found that 69% of Americans are against overturning Roe, while just 30% support a reversal. If the court follows through with the draft decision, 26 states are certain or likely to ban abortion. Those bans could force people to travel far from home to reach states where abortion is legal, seek medication illicitly or attempt to terminate a pregnancy through dangerous means. Many pregnant people will also be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term. And Collins and Murkowski may have nothing to offer Americans but regret.
