4/22/2022,"Boris Johnson has revealed that dozens of Ukrainian soldiers are training in the UK, learning how to use 120 British armoured vehicles before returning with them to fight in the war against Russia. British forces are also training Ukrainian counterparts in Poland on how to use anti-aircraft missiles, the prime minister said, as he outlined further details of the UK’s military aid for Kyiv’s embattled forces. “I can say that we are currently training Ukrainians in Poland in the use of anti-aircraft defence, and actually in the UK in the use of armoured vehicles,” Johnson said on a trip to India, where he was due to meet his counterpart, Narendra Modi. As the Russian invasion heads towards its third month, the UK and other western countries have begun to supply Nato standard weapons to Kyiv, which require short periods of training so Ukrainian soldiers know how to use them. This week the Pentagon said it would train some Ukrainians to use a first batch of 18 US howitzers “outside the country” before the weapons could be used on the battlefield. Both announcements signal a step towards greater western involvement in the war, which has been focused on supplying arms to Ukraine’s forces and targeting Russia with wide ranging economic sanctions. But Johnson’s official spokesperson insisted that training Ukrainians in the UK was not escalatory. “What is escalatory is the actions of Putin and his regime in Ukraine. We are simply working together with our allies to give Ukraine the best tools to defend themselves,” he said. Russia is gradually massing forces in the Donbas region in the east of Ukraine, where western officials believe Moscow already has a three to one advantage over the defenders. Although it is not clear if Russian forces can break through, the US and UK are bracing themselves for a long period of arms supply. Johnson will be discussing the Ukraine situation with Modi. India, which buys military equipment from Russia, abstained on a UN motion condemning Putin’s actions in Ukraine in early March. During the trip, the UK government has announced it will issue an Open General Export Licence (OGEL) to India, the first one it has authorised in the Indo-Pacific region. The move potentially allows the UK to send arms without having to licence them on a case-by-case basis. The government said the OGEL reduces bureaucracy and shortens delivery times for defence procurement. Meanwhile, on Thursday, Joe Biden announced a further $800m (£614m) of military supplies for Ukraine, including 72 howitzers and 144,000 artillery rounds, while European countries such as the Czech Republic have supplied Soviet-designed tanks similar to those already used by Kyiv. Britain has agreed to send at least 120 armoured vehicles, 80 of which are the Mastiff, Husky and Wolfhound protected mobility vehicles, which the British army says are designed to be used in “combat, combat support and combat service roles” driving troops behind and up to the frontlines. The other 40 vehicles are for combat reconnaissance, including the Spartan, which can carry four soldiers plus a crew of three, Samaritan ambulances, Sultan armoured command vehicles, and Samson armoured recovery vehicles. Training on them takes a few weeks, defence sources said, largely so that the Ukrainians can become familiar with the control systems available. The British forces in Poland are understood to be training the Ukrainian military in using the Starstreak air defence missile system and the Stormer vehicles from which the weapons are launched. Johnson’s spokesperson said: “We are moving, in conjunction with our allies, to providing new types of equipment that perhaps the Ukrainians wouldn’t have had previous experience of, so it’s only sensible that they get the requisite training to make the best use of it.”",News/Politics,Ukrainian soldiers training in UK to use British armoured vehicles,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/21/uk-training-ukrainian-soldiers-weapons-equipment
4/22/2022,"Boris Johnson has attacked “prejudice” against environmental policies, as he rejected the idea of ditching green levies on household energy bills to tackle the cost of living crisis. Senior Tories including Steve Baker, who separately called on Johnson to resign over the Partygate revelations, have urged the prime minister to remove the levies, which are set to cost about £153 per household this year and are used to fund energy efficiency measures and renewables. Other Conservatives, including the former Brexit minister David Frost and the party chair, Oliver Dowden, have hit out against what Dowden recently called “net zero dogma”. But when asked about reports the government could scrap the green levies, Johnson appeared to take a sideswipe against sceptical colleagues. “This is very important what I’m saying – there’s a lot of prejudice against the green agenda,” he said. “Actually green technology, green, sustainable electricity can help to reduce bills. Overall if you look at what we have done with renewables it has helped to reduce bills over the last few years and will continue to do so.” He added: “That’s why one of the things I want to do is use this moment to have, to really drive towards more offshore wind turbines.” As well as the levy on household bills, energy firms pay a £1bn charge, the energy company obligation, to fund insulation projects. Experts recently warned that scrapping it could cost more than 30,000 jobs. Government sources said both measures were based on long-term contracts and the only practical way to cut the cost for households would be for the Treasury to meet it instead, something Rishi Sunak has been reluctant to do. Tory MPs have become increasingly vocal in their scepticism about the government’s green policies since last autumn’s Cop26 summit in Glasgow, with divisions emerging over onshore wind, and the controversial practice of fracking, which some cabinet ministers are keen to see revived. A group of Tory backbenchers including Baker have formed the Net Zero Scrutiny Group to put pressure on ministers over some of the measures needed to meet the pledges made at Cop26. Baker responded to reports that green levies could be dropped earlier this week by saying: “Making the public poorer and colder never seemed likely to survive contact with electors.” Frost, who resigned in December, has since been highly critical of Johnson’s stance on a number of issues. He recently urged the prime minister to remove “the neo-socialists, green fanatics and pro-woke crowd” from Downing Street. The government is under mounting pressure to take fresh action to cushion the impact of soaring prices for food, fuel and other commodities. Rishi Sunak was criticised for failing to do enough to help struggling families cope with rocketing costs at last month’s spring statement. But Johnson defended the chancellor, who was widely reported to have considered resigning after receiving a fixed-penalty notice for attending Johnson’s lockdown birthday party. Asked whether Sunak would still be in place in the autumn, when government sources have suggested there could be fresh measures to help cash-strapped households, Johnson said: “The answer to that is yes.” Asked if emergency measures could be brought in before the autumn, when the energy price cap is expected to rise sharply again, Johnson said: “We will do everything we can to help people through the aftershocks of Covid as we have during the pandemic.” He declined to be drawn into guaranteeing the future of any other cabinet ministers, amid speculation he could reshuffle his top team before the summer recess. “Rule number one: don’t talk about politicians, talk about what politicians can do for the electorate,” he told journalists. “Let’s talk about what we’re doing and let’s not talk about who’s going to do it.” However, he praised the home secretary for her widely criticised migration policy, under which asylum seekers arriving in the UK face deportation to Rwanda. Pressed on whether Priti Patel’s job was safe, he said: “You’re not going to get any more out of me about politicians or Westminster politics narrowly conceived. We’ve got to focus on the agenda for the country.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson appears to take sideswipe at Tory climate policy sceptics ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/21/boris-johnson-sideswipe-tory-climate-policy-sceptics-green-levies
4/22/2022,"During this year’s Six Nations, lightning did not strike twice. Whereas Louis Rees-Zammit blazed his way through his debut championship in 2021, he failed to score a try and was axed for Wales’s key match against England. His Gloucester director of rugby, George Skivington, sums up nicely the predicament the 21-year-old winger found himself in: “When you’re one of the poster boys of the game, everybody knows when you’ve been dropped.” It represented a first major setback for Rees-Zammit, the youngest member of last year’s British & Irish Lions squad, but one that he dwelled on for all of five minutes. He does not lack for self‑belief, repeatedly insisting “I know what I can do”, but Skivington sees a more rounded player who still has considerable room to improve. He has scored five Premiership tries this season – the same as last term – but a loss in form led to his high-profile omission from the Twickenham encounter and the suspicion that maybe not everything is coming as easy to Rees-Zammit as when he burst on to the scene. “I get down on myself for about five minutes then I’m straight on my laptop to analyse and look at my game,” he says. “When I get dropped or play badly, I’ve just got to learn from it. “It’s not really a confidence thing because I know what I can do – it’s just about doing your training then going out at the weekend and putting it all on show. Hopefully, I’ve done that pretty well. It hasn’t taken me too long. “We found the team out, I wasn’t in it and I just talked to my close mates like Dan Biggar and Jonathan Davies. They said to me: ‘We’ve all been here – go away and prove to the coaches why you should be in the team.’ That’s all I could do, because he [Wayne Pivac] wasn’t going to say: ‘Ah, you’re moaning about it, I’ll put you back in.’” Rees-Zammit does not believe his loss of form was as a result of being targeted but he admits to having to stay patient and wait for his opportunities this season. In part that is because Gloucester have developed such a lethal weapon with their driving maul the ball does not always make its way to the wing but it has been mightily effective. The Cherry and Whites hope to take a significant step closer to the Premiership playoffs by beating Bristol at Ashton Gate on Friday night. They were given a pre-match boost having moved into fifth place on Thursday after being awarded five points by an independent panel after the cancellation of their match against Worcester on 25 March. “I probably haven’t had the ball as much as I did last year,” he says. “It’s probably just the way the team is playing – I have been working hard on my kick-chase and getting up for high balls. It is about staying patient and when I do get that opportunity I have got to back myself and hopefully take it. “You probably see a lot of stuff about me off the field but my attention doesn’t change. I’m all focused on rugby and the spotlight doesn’t really affect me.” Skivington, meanwhile, is delighted with Rees-Zammit’s recent form during back-to-back wins in the Challenge Cup, praising his “nitty-gritty” work as opposed to the headline-grabbing tries. It should be noted, however, that he produced one of those two minutes after coming off the bench against Northampton in his first appearance since losing his Wales place. “They wanted me to try to get my hands on the ball more and work harder,” he says. “They wanted me to get in the positions to get the ball, by working off my wing. I went away, came off the bench against Northampton and got the ball in my hands after two minutes and scored. I tried to prove to the coaches why I should be in the team.” He subsequently came off the bench in the narrow defeat by France and started the “embarrassing” loss to Italy but is set for a summer return to South Africa where he will hope to see more game time than with the Lions last year. Skivington, for his part, is convinced Rees-Zammit is no flash in the pan. “He’s impressed me through that because he’s a young man and he’s had a very fast-tracked career so far and found himself on a British & Irish Lions series at 20,” he says. “That’s not how most people’s careers start off. “That Six Nations period was the first time he’s had a real bump in the road and it was probably a bit of a shock. It’s quite a tough thing to deal with but I was really impressed with his attitude.”",Sport/Sport,‘I know what I can do’: Louis Rees-Zammit finding form with Gloucester,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/21/louis-rees-zammit-wales-six-nations-gloucester-premiership-rugby
4/22/2022,"US Drug Enforcement Administration agents have extradited the Honduran former president Juan Orlando Hernández to New York, where he will face federal drug trafficking and weapons charges. Honduran national police delivered a handcuffed Hernández to DEA agents at the Tegucigalpa airport just over two months after he was arrested outside his home on 15 February following an extradition request from the US Department of Justice. Hernández, 53, left office on 27 January after two terms as president. Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York have accused him of accepting millions of dollars in bribes from violent drug traffickers in exchange for protection from law enforcement. He is charged with drug trafficking conspiracy and two related weapons charges, which carry a combined mandatory minimum sentence of 40 years in prison. Hernández is expected to plead not guilty upon arraignment. He has repeatedly denied any involvement with drug traffickers, describing the allegations as lies made up by criminals who are trying to reduce their own sentences through cooperation. “This is revenge from the cartels, it’s an orchestrated plot so that no government will confront them again,” he said in a handwritten letter published last month. “Part of that conspiracy has been a campaign of hate and misinformation. But it’s evident, the contradictions of criminals, trial after trial, they lie and contradict themselves.” Considered one of Washington’s top allies in the region during his first term, garnering praise from US officials including the then vice-president, Joe Biden, the conservative president fell out of favour with Democrats following his questionable 2017 re-election and mounting drug trafficking allegations after the arrest of his brother, the former legislator Juan Antonio “Tony” Hernández, on the same charges in 2018. Tony Hernández was later convicted and sentenced to life in prison. President Biden shunned Hernández upon taking office last year, but has since embraced the new Honduran president, the centre-left Xiomara Castro, who was elected by a landslide in November in a vote considered a referendum on the eight scandal-plagued years of the Hernández administration. The extradition of Hernández – once untouchable in Honduras – presented an early test for the Castro administration, which came to power on a promise to fight drug trafficking and corruption. Over the past three years, the case US authorities were building against Hernández became increasingly clear. Prosecutors named Hernández as an unindicted co-conspirator in his brother’s trial and two subsequent cases, including that of the former national police chief Juan Carlos Bonilla. According to the complaint filed against Bonilla, nicknamed “el Tigre” (the Tiger) for his fierce appearance and violent reputation, the former top cop allegedly protected drug shipments and carried out special tasks for the Hernández brothers, including murder. He was captured on 9 March after nearly a year on the run and is likely to be extradited to New York in May. Hernández had been protected from prosecution by US authorities because of a Department of Justice policy not to indict sitting presidents. But a warrant for his arrest was issued under seal within hours of his leaving office, and the request for his extradition was sent to Honduras three weeks later. In 2012, as president of the National Congress, Hernández played a key role in the passage of a constitutional reform allowing Honduran nationals to be extradited to the US on drug trafficking and other charges. He often cited this as evidence of his innocence, stating that someone who worked to push extradition through Congress would not conspire with drug traffickers. Hernández is the 30th Honduran to be extradited to the US. Organised crime has infiltrated politics across Latin America, but Hernández is the first former president in the region to be extradited to the US to face drug trafficking charges. The case draws close comparison to that of Panama’s former dictator Manuel Noriega, a general and de facto leader who was extradited to the US on drug trafficking charges following a December 1989 US military invasion that ousted him. Like Hernández, Noriega was accused of double-crossing the DEA. He was convicted and spent almost two decades in prison.",News/World news,Ex-president of Honduras extradited to US on drugs charges,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/ex-president-of-honduras-extradited-to-us-on-drugs-charges
4/22/2022,"Welcome to Manchester, Erik. We’ve been expecting you. Here it comes at last, the latest rummage, the latest mystery gift from the Manchester United managerial lucky dip. There is a game you can play with the managerial appointments of the post-Ferguson years. This is an appointment process so refined it has, to date, dished up five random, ill-fitting, hilariously oscillating selections in the course of the past decade. At the end of which the fascination is not so much what the latest hopeful can do with Manchester United, but what Manchester United is going to do to him, what quality, what weakness, what blind spots will be picked out and magnified in that hard white light into something monstrous and cartoon-like. David Moyes, who came in a little above his level, was recast by eight months in the job as a total imposter, some hollow-eyed passer-by with an empty briefcase on his desk. Ole Gunnar Solskjær, always a company hire, was transformed into a fawning yes-man, a gargoyle of the Old Trafford waxwork museum. Ralf Rangnick’s weakness was always likely to be his remoteness. Processed through the Old Trafford hall of mirrors Rangnick has become a kind of footballing martian, a baffled-looking time traveller, the world’s worst star of Doctor Who. Everyone has a plan until they’re made Manchester United manager. What will it do to Ten Hag? And yet there is also hope. This is by any reasonable standard a sensible appointment. Ten Hag is a talented coach and a man of substance. For the first time since Alex Ferguson back in 1986 Manchester United have sourced a manager who is qualified on his record but also still on the rise in his own career. Ten Hag is agreeably serious. He has good influences. He seems state of the art in his ideas. Players have described him as a father figure and notably sympathetic one-to-one, essential qualities in a squad that appears to be teetering constantly on the verge of some kind of collective personality breakdown. There have some whispers about Ten Hag’s age, the slightly misleading sense that this is a young head coach (in fact, at 52 Ten Hag would be the sixth-oldest manager in the Premier League if he took charge today). There was a 10-year gap between retirement as a player and a first headline coaching job. A good year at Go Ahead Eagles was followed by some stuff at Bayern Munich II, not exactly a talent pipeline (his predecessor Mehmet Scholl is a TV pundit; his successor is managing Borussia Mönchengladbach reserves). Eventually, aged 47, Ten Hag took Utrecht into the Europa League. Two years on from there his Ajax team were beating Real Madrid 4-1 at the Bernabéu and that slow-burn trajectory was set. Ten Hag has a reputation for promoting youth, for working to a specific 4-3-3 system, but those who know him say he will build around what he has. His current Ajax team has 10 regular outfield players. Six are 24 or younger. Three are over 30. Jurriën Timber and Antony have already been fingered as likely United recruits. But Ten Hag also values grizzled, plateauing old pros. In which case, old boy, you might just be in luck. The key task will be to break the cycle of mediocrity, to put a firewall between his own work and the layers of middle management inserted by the ownership. Rangnick has complained that United have technical players who are not physical, and physical players who are not technical. But there is talent here. Football is a surprisingly simple business, the idea of deep-rooted character rot always a little overblown, a case of reacting to the theatre of defeat. Two years of disciplined management, of stubbornness, of insisting on following his own process could inject even this ghost ship, this gothic mansion, with a little warmth, a sense of sharpened edges. At which point, of course, reality must intrude. It isn’t hard to see why Ten Hag looks like an attractive option to the United board. As so often, this feels like a shortcut, a way of trying to reach a desirable end point without actually putting in the necessary work. Here is a club that lacks method, structure, coherent culture. How do we solve that? How about tacking on the most visible part of Ajax, a club that has all of these things? Ten Hag’s success is of course an expression of that Ajax culture, not its essence or its key ingredient. Appointing him is in one sense another Rangnick: a process manager at a club that has no process; another doomed attempt by this hollowed-out robot replicant of a club to ape the human elements of a successful sporting culture. By the same token, nothing on Ten Hag’s own résumé says he has the capacity to take an ailing celebrity club, a kind of cocktail party for the disaffected A-lister, and make it function as a coherent unit. But then, who does? Zinedine Zidane? Gordon Ramsay? Volodymyr Zelenskiy? If this feels like a deeply strange task at a deeply strange sporting entity, there is perhaps some comfort in the fact being Manchester United manager has always been difficult. Only three managers have ever won the league at Manchester United. This is a club with 42 major trophies, 33 of them won by two men in two distinct spells. The pattern, if we can find one, is stasis, decline, crisis, revolution. Matt Busby took a club that had been bombed into the dust by the Luftwaffe, Alex Ferguson a booze-addled ship without a league title in 20 years. While the Glazer ownership is rightly reviled, the fact remains that part of that tricky Manchester United gravity has always been that sense of show, glitz, The Brand, an event-glamour that is a part of the club’s sense of itself, from dapper Mr Busby to David Beckham flopping his hair in the August sunshine. The Glazers have taken this to its grisly extreme. What we have here is the debauched, late-capitalism version, all human elements subsumed by the urge to sell that brand, to hammer it until it breaks. It is hard not to wish Ten Hag well in this environment, to hope that out of his basic footballing virtues, a culture of care and detail and collectivism, something coherent can arise. Right now, though, the fear is more what this club might do to him over the next three years.",Sport/Football,Erik ten Hag faces tough task to turn Manchester United’s ghost ship around | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/21/erik-ten-hag-manchester-united-manager-ajax-comment
4/22/2022,"Boris Johnson has hinted that physical Brexit border checks on food imports from the EU due to be introduced in July will be delayed for the fourth time amid fears that European supplies of everything from cheese to Parma ham would collapse. Industry sources said an announcement on a new border operating model was expected next week that could push back the checks by up to nine months. Asked during his visit to India if this was the case, the prime minister said: “I’m generally in favour of minimal friction at all junctures between the UK and the EU.” He also indicated he had not abandoned hope that the Irish Sea border checks could, in time, be moved to the Northern Ireland border with the Republic of Ireland, something that was rejected during the four years of negotiations over the UK’s divorce from the EU. “New technology will make some of the checks we have obsolete. That leads me on to the long-term solution to the border of Northern Ireland and the Republic, but that’s another matter,” he told reporters. Sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks have been operational in all EU border countries including France, Belgium and Ireland since the Brexit withdrawal agreement was implemented on 1 January 2021. The cliff-edge approach left exporters of fish and other fresh food in chaos with a lack of customs agents and veterinary staff to certify whether the produce complied with EU standards. But in the UK, post-Brexit checks on fresh food were not implemented for imports, being pushed back in 2020 and on two occasions in 2021. Under the current border plan, physical checks on meat were due to start on 1 July, dairy on 1 September and all remaining foods including fish and composite foods subject to checks from 1 November. The government confirmed this timetable was “under careful review” amid concerns about the impact on household supplies. “We are keeping this issue under careful review, given ongoing supply chain disruption – including as a result of Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine – and wider cost of living pressures. “It is precisely because of Brexit that we’re able to set an import controls regime which is best suited to our own needs,” said a government spokesperson. One industry source said the biggest risk from the new Brexit checks was the “collapse of the supply chain” because of a shortage of vets to certify produce before it can be put on a ferry to Britain. There is also a fear that red tape and new costs will cause some small suppliers to give up on the UK market.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson hints at further delay of post-Brexit EU import checks,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/21/boris-johnson-hints-further-delay-post-brexit-eu-import-checks
