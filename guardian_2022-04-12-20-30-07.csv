4/12/2022,"Pickling isn’t usually seen as an art form. But two out of the three artists in the Vasseur Baltic artists’ award have been fermenting: Ima-Abasi Okon to explore the probiotic benefits of fermentation and Fernando García-Dory to showcase the pickling skills of a local community interest company. Okon’s dehydrated, vacuum-packed pile of oxtail stew with scotch bonnet, ashwagandha, lion’s mane and tulsi is piled up on a cane chair, while jars of produce from The Pickle Palace line the wooden structures of García-Dory’s installation. Presumably, pickling hasn’t been high on artists’ agendas because visually it doesn’t pack much of a punch. Certainly, Okon’s seated stack is an intriguing, juicy, visceral lump of flesh and guts, but García-Dory’s jars are reminiscent of a weekend meander around Sainsbury’s. The Vasseur Baltic artists’ award – a biennial award of £25,000 (plus £5,000 artist fee) offered to three emerging artists, judged by three other artists – is bursting at the seams with ideas. Wonderful, provocative ideas that question how culture and nature intersect, how land can unite communities, how life can be preserved. It is interesting, but it is not arresting. However, interesting is still an important word when viewing art. García-Dory does an outstanding job of introducing us to a Lake District farm that has searched for ways to diversify and educate; a sailing university of interdisciplinary arts that challenged the usual urban sites of artistic production; and the Freemen that are protecting the Town Moor, an area of greenery in the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne. In 2009, García-Dory established Inland, a collective dedicated to agricultural, social and cultural production where exhibition creation is as important as cheesemaking. Consequently, the artist’s presentation is a museum of organisations that use making to interact with the natural world and build community. The shelves hold bars of soap from a north England farm, knitted lampshades from a local creative and botanical illustrations by the naturalist John Hancock. Alongside, there are photographs of sheep grazing in the centre of Madrid, a bus that doubles up as an art gallery and Federico García Lorca’s mobile theatre. Despite this, I still can’t shake the feeling of being in a trendy minimalist shop. In contrast, Okon has a big, empty space. Empty but for the artist’s certificates in food hygiene, manual handling and food allergy awareness, the music licence for her sound piece, and boneshaking bass emanating from a Leslie speaker in the following room. The documentation allows the artist to serve the aforementioned oxtail as food and to play a screwed audio track. Drawn in by the up-tempo beats, we walk into Okon’s second space, where the cane swivel chair stacked with oxtail faces the speaker made in decorative hardwoods. There are traces of invisible people everywhere: the certificates of labour in the first empty room, the chair as if someone has suddenly stepped outside, the title cards that read like silent transcripts. Okon had been researching palliative care methods and the ghostly figures get me thinking about my own fleshy cocoon and its fermentation capabilities once I too disappear. Sometimes though, I want to be run over by an artwork, knocked on the head so hard my eyes are wide and my brain is silent, which is exactly what happens in the presence of Laleh Khorramian’s work in the final space. Huge swathes of fabric rise up, layered in prints and materials and dancing with colour. Narrow light boxes punched with vibrant filters slither through the wall and a giant translucent print creates a stained-glass window. Entitled Fontanelle, after the soft gap in a newborn baby’s skull, the large monotype print is placed on what was once a back wall and has been removed to reveal a window. Khorramian creates monotypes by applying oil paint on polypropylene or glass and transferring it to paper. The effect is organic and surprising, producing a kaleidoscope of unfamiliar forms. During the pandemic, Khorramian made thousands of masks for those in need and the remnants of the fabric clamber up her tapestries like spines. And, with names like Glass Person, Jag Lady and Totem of a Deity, her floor-to-ceiling banners transform into revered individuals in a futuristic hall of fame where our heroes upcycle and wear dresses. Eventually, Khorramian appears and offers me a piece of dark chocolate. Perhaps his was the post-Covid world of which I’ve dreamt.

4/12/2022,"I was so relieved to see your article breaking the taboo of prolapses (‘You feel so sexless and dirty’: the women living with incontinence after childbirth, 7 April). There has been a culture of silence around women’s health issues that has left women like me walking blindly into harm’s way. I suffered a needless prolapse because I made uninformed decisions during my pregnancy and labour, and postpartum. I did heavy and awkward lifting during pregnancy, and high-impact exercises postpartum. Most people reading this probably won’t know what prolapse is because we have never been told, because it is taboo. Prolapse is where internal organs can fall out of place and into the vagina, leaving sufferers in permanent discomfort. At the time I was left to feel stupid and ashamed. I asked myself how could I not have known that? Had I been so caught up in focusing on the pregnancy and birth that I hadn’t paid any attention to any advice postpartum? When I was finally able to see a doctor, he said: “Oh that’s just what happens. Women are designed badly.” I felt so stupid that I didn’t know, but when I read back through pregnancy books, they don’t have prolapse in the appendices or index. I wasn’t stupid, I just was never told. There has been a pervasive culture of withholding information about pelvic floor exercises and prolapse. I had an argument with a male friend who is a GP about women not being warned about prolapse, and he said: “They don’t want women to be too scared to give birth.” That is nonsense. I knew I might die from pregnancy and childbirth. I can handle knowing about prolapse. We can all handle knowing about prolapse.Name and address supplied",Lifestyle/Life and style,Culture of silence on prolapse is doing serious harm to women | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/12/culture-of-silence-on-prolapse-is-doing-serious-harm-to-women
4/12/2022,"Sometimes, when faced with a serious dilemma, it is worth rewinding back to the start. It can even help occasionally to open a dictionary and check, for example, a sport’s precise definition. So here’s a quiz question: which of the following appears beside the word “rugby” in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary? Is it a) a collision-based game, b) a physical contest or c) a contact sport? Take your time because this is important. Because, interestingly, the aforementioned dictionary listing includes none of the three descriptions above. Instead it simply reads: “Game played with oval ball which may be kicked or carried.” Keep that in mind as you ponder what modern rugby union should be aiming to be and whether it is becoming too confusing by half for players, referees and fans alike. Either way, in the vital pursuit of seeking to make the game “safer”, massive athletes are increasingly being asked to dance on the head of an impossibly small pin. To be a player, coach or match official is even to be unsure what constitutes “foul play”. The weekend saw some high-profile case studies which, in their different ways, cut to the heart of the tangled debate. Take Guy Porter’s red card for Leicester in Clermont for a head-to-head collision with the massive Fritz Lee. Neither man had the ball and essentially bumped into each other. Foul play? It was more like watching two people in a crowded pub, both equally intent on not spilling their pints, who fail to spot each other and accidentally collide. Is that the fault of the disorientated visitor who has never previously visited the bar or the regular who didn’t double-check his regular route to the dart board was clear? Or neither of them? By the letter of the law, though, there was head contact. For that reason the otherwise excellent Georgian referee Nika Amashukeli felt he had no option but to show Porter red. Head injuries have to be reduced somehow. Even senior officials within World Rugby, though, privately acknowledged on Monday the framework used to determine such incidents may need tweaking. Porter didn’t lower his body height because, with the ball disappearing out the back behind the dummy runner Lee, there wasn’t an obvious tackle to make. Next up is the Exeter v Munster game and the yellow card shown to Olly Woodburn for catching a visiting head with a forearm as he sought to clear out a second-half ruck. According to Rob Baxter, Exeter’s director of rugby, it was nothing remotely unusual: “That’s a rugby clear-out that has happened probably 30 or 40 times in a game. I could go downstairs and clip out 20 rucks where someone’s arms when they have bound at a ruck have gone into a head. “To the absolute letter of the law it’s maybe a penalty, maybe a yellow card, but if we are going to freeze frame every breakdown there is going to be an awful lot of yellow cards knocking about. I thought we had moved on from that, I thought we were looking for clear and definitive high contact to heads and faces with no mitigation and no dropping in height. This feels like it goes against all of that.” Quite so. In which case how did Jamison Gibson-Park not see red for an upright shoulder to the head of his opposite number Kieran Marmion in Friday’s game between Connacht and Leinster? These things are magnified by the two-leg nature of the weekend’s European ties but inconsistent decision-making has major implications. Porter’s red card, as it turned out, did not cost Leicester victory but that was down to the 14 remaining Tigers playing out of their collective skins. So what next? To be clear this is emphatically not one of those ridiculous “the game’s gone soft” articles which merely show an alarming ignorance about the commitment and dynamism of today’s players, never mind the vital importance of prioritising brain health. The tragic news from South Africa over the weekend, where the 18-year-old Liyabona Teyise died following a schools match, is just another reminder that rugby is a game with an inherent element of risk attached. Other sports such as equestrianism can be dangerous, too, but that is not the point. Nor is a 20-minute red card the way forward. The game could push the offside line further back to neuter “blitz” defences. Or reduce substitutions to increase the prospect of more space later in games. What if teams were allowed only a certain maximum number of phases in the opposing 22, after which the ball is automatically turned over? No matter if that feels too close to rugby league. How else to reduce the number of head-down, bone-shuddering charges at human brick walls from two yards out? Because the current truth is that rugby of both codes is stuck between a ruck and a hard place. No self-respecting administrator can blithely ignore the litigation hanging over the sport, the top-level injury toll, the premature retirements of talented athletes still in their 20s or parental reservations. But is there any other sport in which the definition of foul play is becoming less clear and obvious? Rugby does not have to be totally redefined but it does need to decide what kind of sport it wants to be. This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

4/12/2022,"The US has said it has asked all its non-essential staff and their family members at the Shanghai consulate to leave, in Washington’s latest response to the financial hub’s handling of the worsening Covid outbreak. The state department ordered the departure “due to the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak” there, according to a spokesperson from its Beijing embassy. “It is best for our employees and their families to be reduced in number and our operations to be scaled down as we deal with the changing circumstances on the ground,” the person said on Tuesday. Washington’s latest move came after the state department on Friday announced that non-emergency personnel could voluntarily leave the Shanghai consulate. It is not clear why the departure of those workers had become mandatory in a short span of a few days. China responded angrily to the earlier voluntary departure order, saying Beijing was “strongly dissatisfied” with and “firmly opposed” the US’s “groundless accusation” about China’s Covid policy. Shanghai’s handling of the latest Covid outbreak has made international headlines in the last few weeks. But the most controversial of its practices had been separating Covid-positive children from their parents. Although the authorities have since made some concessions, the state department cited the risk of parents and children being separated in its announcement. Shanghai on Tuesday reported 22,348 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases and 994 symptomatic cases for 11 April, the local government said. Asymptomatic cases were down from 25,173 a day earlier. The symptomatic cases rose from 914. The harsh lockdown in China’s most populous city – home to nearly 26 million people – has also caused a backlash among its residents. In the last few weeks, many patients have complained about being unable to access medical care facilities. Stories of food shortages have prompted citizens in other parts of China to rush to stockpile goods. The situation in Shanghai has also led the EU chamber of commerce to warn that China’s zero-Covid strategy was “eroding foreign investors’ confidence”. In a letter, it urged the Chinese government to shift its approach by giving the Chinese population access to mRNA vaccines and allowing people with mild symptoms to quarantine at home. Despite international pressure, Beijing did not seem able to adjust its zero-Covid policy, said Chen Zhengming, a professor of epidemiology at Oxford University. “China is in such a dilemma right now that if it sticks to this policy there’d be big burden to the economy and cause secondary disasters such as [those] in medical care. But if it loosens the policy, there may be a huge spike in new infections.” On Monday, Shanghai authorities started easing lockdown in some parts of the city, despite reporting a record of more than 25,000 new Covid cases. Residents of neighbourhoods where there have been no positive cases for at least two weeks were allowed some degree of freedom, but they were not allowed to travel to those still under severe lockdowns. Chinese officials admitted the situation in Shanghai was concerning. “The epidemic is in a rapid increase phase, with social transmission still not brought under effective control,” said Lei Zhenglong of the National Health Commission at a briefing in Beijing on Tuesday. “The forecast for the next few days is that the number of infected people will remain at a high level.”",News/World news,US tells some consulate staff to leave Shanghai as Covid outbreak worsens,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/us-orders-some-consulate-staff-to-leave-shanghai-as-china-covid-outbreak-worsens
4/12/2022,"Frances O’Grady will stand down as general secretary of the Trades Union Congress at the end of the year. The first woman to hold the post in the TUC’s 154-year-old history, she said it had been the greatest honour of her life and a privilege to serve the trade union movement during a turbulent decade for workers in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. O’Grady has been general secretary of the TUC, the UK union movement’s umbrella group, since January 2013. Early in the Covid pandemic she played a key role alongside Carolyn Fairbairn, then head of the CBI, the business lobby group, in drawing up the furlough scheme with the chancellor, Rishi Sunak. O’Grady said: “Unions are a force for good in British society. I am proud of what we achieved during the pandemic – from securing furlough to keeping people safe at work, championing equality and keeping vital services running. And I’m proud of the work we do every day protecting workers’ jobs, pay, rights and working conditions.” She said she was happy to be stepping down at a time when unions were growing their membership, as the movement fought to improve working standards amid pressure on living costs. “The last decade has been turbulent, with three general elections, two anti-trade union bills, an EU referendum and a pandemic to contend with,” she said. “But on every occasion unions have risen to the challenge and fought for working people.”",News/Politics,Frances O’Grady to stand down as TUC leader at end of year,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/12/frances-ogrady-to-stand-down-as-tuc-leader-at-end-of-year
4/12/2022,"The Russian people know little about Putin’s war on Ukraine because Putin has blocked their access to the truth, substituting propaganda and lies. Years ago, pundits assumed the internet would open a new era of democracy, giving everyone access to the truth. But dictators like Putin and demagogues like Trump have demonstrated how naive that assumption was. At least the US responded to Trump’s lies. Trump had 88 million Twitter followers before Twitter took him off its platform – just two days after the attack on the Capitol, which he provoked, in part, with his tweets. (Trump’s social media accounts were also suspended on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitch and TikTok.) These moves were necessary to protect American democracy. But Elon Musk – the richest man in the world, with 80 million Twitter followers – wasn’t pleased. Musk tweeted that US tech companies shouldn’t be acting “as the de facto arbiter of free speech”. Musk continues to tell his 80 million followers all sorts of things. I disagree with many of his positions, but ever since I posted a tweet two years ago criticizing him for how he treated his Tesla workers he has blocked me – so I can’t view or post criticisms of his tweets to his followers. Seems like an odd move for someone who describes himself as a “free speech absolutist”. Musk advocates free speech but in reality it’s just about power. Power compelled Musk to buy $2.64bn of Twitter stock, making him the largest individual shareholder. Last week, Twitter announced that Musk would be joining Twitter’s board of directors, prompting Musk to promise “significant improvements” in the platform. Sunday evening, though, it was announced that Musk would not be joining Twitter’s board. No reason was given but it’s probably part of a bargaining kabuki dance. Musk wouldn’t have plopped down $2.64bn for nothing. If he is not on Twitter’s board, he’s not bound by a “standstill” agreement in which he pledged to buy no more than 14.9% of Twitter’s stock. Musk now faces no limit on how much of Twitter’s stock he can buy. He’ll buy as much as he needs to gain total control. What “improvements” does Musk have in mind for Twitter? Will he use his clout over Twitter to prevent users with tens of millions of followers from blocking people who criticize them? I doubt it. Will Musk use his clout to let Trump back on? I fear he will. Musk has long advocated a libertarian vision of an “uncontrolled” internet. That vision is dangerous rubbish. There’s no such animal, and there never will be. Someone has to decide on the algorithms in every platform – how they’re designed, how they evolve, what they reveal and what they hide. Musk has enough power and money to quietly give himself this sort of control over Twitter. Musk talks about freedom of speech but his real power is freedom of reach – reaching 80 million Twitter followers without accountability to anyone (including critics like me) – and enough money to buy himself a seat on Twitter’s board. Musk has never believed that power comes with responsibility. He’s been unperturbed when his tweets cause real suffering. During his long and storied history with Twitter he has threatened journalists and tweeted reckless things. In March 2020 he tweeted that children were “essentially immune” to Covid. He has pushed cryptocurrencies that he’s invested in. When a college student started a Twitter account to track Musk’s private plane, Musk tried and failed to buy him off, before blocking him. The Securities and Exchange Commission went after Musk after he tweeted that he had funding to take Tesla private, a clear violation of the law. Musk paid a fine and agreed to let lawyers vet future sensitive tweets, but he has tried to reverse this requirement. He has also been openly contemptuous of the SEC, tweeting at one point that the “E” stands for “Elon’s”. (You can guess what the “S” and “C” stand for.) By the way, how does the SEC go after Musk’s ability to tweet now that he owns Twitter? Billionaires like Musk have shown time and again they consider themselves above the law. And to a large extent, they are. Musk has enough wealth that legal penalties are no more than slaps on his wrist, and enough power to control one of the most important ways the public now receives news. Think about it: after years of posting tweets that skirt the law, Musk was given a seat on Twitter’s board (and is probably now negotiating for even more clout). Musk says he wants to “free” the internet. But what he really aims to do is make it even less accountable than it is now, when it’s often impossible to discover who is making the decisions about how algorithms are designed, who is filling social media with lies, who’s poisoning our minds with pseudo-science and propaganda, and who’s deciding which versions of events go viral and which stay under wraps. Make no mistake: this is not about freedom. It’s about power. In Musk’s vision of Twitter and the internet, he’d be the wizard behind the curtain – projecting on the world’s screen a fake image of a brave new world empowering everyone. In reality, that world would be dominated by the richest and most powerful people in the world, who wouldn’t be accountable to anyone for facts, truth, science or the common good. That’s Musk’s dream. And Trump’s. And Putin’s. And the dream of every dictator, strongman, demagogue and modern-day robber baron on Earth. For the rest of us, it would be a brave new nightmare.

4/12/2022,"The artist who installed the fourth plinth sculpture in Trafalgar Square featuring a dollop of whipped cream topped with a cherry, a drone and a fly has been shortlisted for this year’s Turner prize. Heather Phillipson joins Ingrid Pollard, Veronica Ryan and Sin Wai Kin on this year’s shortlist for the prize, as it returns to Liverpool for the first time in 15 years. The artists in the running for the world’s best-known awards for visual art use different media and forms of expression to help people reconnect with each other and the world around them, as societies emerge from the pandemic. Phillipson was nominated for her solo exhibition RUPTURE NO 1: blowtorching the bitten peach at Tate Britain and her Trafalgar Square fourth plinth commission, THE END. Her practice involves collisions of different materials, media and gestures in what she calls “quantum thought experiments”. The jury described the overwhelming experience of visiting Phillipson’s immersive Tate exhibition after lockdown “and applauded the way she splices absurdity, tragedy and imagination to probe urgent and complex ideas”. Pollard was nominated for her solo exhibition Carbon Slowly Turning at MK Gallery in Milton Keynes. Working primarily in photography, but also sculpture, film and sound, her work questions our relationship with the natural world and interrogates ideas such as Britishness, race and sexuality. The Tate said Pollard’s work had for decades uncovered stories and histories hidden in plain sight. “[The jury] were struck by the bold new developments in Pollard’s recent work, especially a new series of kinetic, anthropomorphic sculptures, which build on Pollard’s career-long enquiry into the figure moving through space,” it added. Nominated for her solo exhibition Along a Spectrum at Spike Island, Bristol, and her Hackney Windrush art commission in London, Ryan creates sculptural objects and installations using containers, compartments, and combinations of natural and fabricated forms to reference displacement, fragmentation and alienation. The jury praised her new body of work made during a residency at Spike Island, which explores ecology, history and dislocation, as well as the psychological impact of the pandemic. They were struck by the “exquisite sensuality and tactility of her sculptures, both in the gallery and for the public commission in Hackney”, the Tate said. Sin was nominated for their involvement in the British Art Show 9 and solo presentation at Blindspot Gallery at the Frieze London art fair. They tell stories through performance, moving image, writing, and print. Drawing on their own experience existing between binary categories, “their work realises fictional narratives to describe lived realities of desire, identification, and consciousness”, the Tate said. The jury highlighted Sin’s film Dream of Wholeness in Parts 2021, in which traditional Chinese philosophy and dramaturgy intersects with contemporary drag, music and poetry. The Turner prize aims to promote public debate around new developments in contemporary British art. Established in 1984, it is named after the radical British painter JMW Turner (1775-1851). Each year, a winner is awarded £25,000 with £10,000 going to each of the other shortlisted artists. Tate Liverpool was the first gallery outside London to host the prize in 2007 when it helped launch the city’s year as European Capital of Culture. Alex Farquharson, the director of Tate Britain and co-chair of the Turner Prize jury, said: “With so many museums and galleries reopening in May 2021, it’s been a terrific 12 months for contemporary British art, as demonstrated by this excitingly rich and varied Turner prize shortlist. “Art has provided much-needed enjoyment and escape over the past year, but it has also helped to reconnect us with each other and the world around us, as the practices of the four shortlisted artists variously exemplify.” Helen Legg, the director of Tate Liverpool and co-chair of the Turner prize jury, said: “The jury has travelled the length and breadth of the country, taking advantage of the easing of lockdown to enjoy the explosion of creativity that has emerged from the pandemic. The result is a diverse group of artists, each with a singular vision, who impressed the judges with the intensity of presentations, while also dealing with important issues facing our society today.” Last year’s prize was won by the Array Collective, an 11-strong group of artists from across the sectarian divide in Northern Ireland. They beat four other art collectives, the first time no individual artist was shortlisted for the prize. This year’s winner will be announced at a ceremony in December and an exhibition of their work will be held at the Tate Liverpool from 20 October 2022 to 19 March 2023.",Arts/Art and design,Turner prize: Trafalgar Square whipped cream and fly sculpture among shortlist,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/12/turner-prize-trafalgar-square-whipped-cream-and-fly-sculpture-among-shortlist
