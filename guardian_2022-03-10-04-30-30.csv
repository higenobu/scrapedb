3/10/2022,"A Conservative party peer attended Cop26 in Glasgow as part of Russia’s group of participants at the UN climate summit, the Guardian can reveal. Greg Barker, a former energy minister when David Cameron was prime minister, attended the talks as part of the party of the Russian Federation, according to a list published by the UN. Lord Barker resigned on Monday as chair of the Russian mining company En+ Group. The company is part-owned by the Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, who was sanctioned by the US in 2018. En+ confirmed that Barker attended with a pass from Russia’s allocation. His resignation followed intense scrutiny of his relationship with the company, including by senior Tory party colleagues, amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Share instruments in En+, which is incorporated in Russia, were suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange on Thursday. The presence of Barker on the list emerged in analysis of lobbying at the summit by Global Witness, Corporate Accountability and Corporate Europe Observatory, three non-government organisations. Barker was ennobled in 2015 by Cameron, after serving for four years as minister of state for climate change. Barker had served as Conservative MP for Bexhill and Battle. However, he is not thought to have attended the House of Lords since 2019. A source familiar with the matter said Barker did not participate in, or attend, any official Russian government functions, meetings or receive any briefings at the climate summit. Anneliese Dodds, the Labour party chair, said: “The Conservatives have serious questions to answer about why it seems one of their peers was allowed to attend Cop26 as part of Russia’s party.” Dodds added that “urgent action” was required from the Conservatives to remove people from the political party who have links to Putin’s regime. Barker had been heavily criticised by Conservative party colleagues and other political parties for his prior involvement with En+. The former Tory minister David Davis said: “As a matter of law, people like him should be disqualified from holding office in those companies.” Murray Worthy, a gas campaign leader at Global Witness, said: “Lord Barker has serious questions to answer as to why he was registered to the world’s most important climate talks as part of the official Russian delegation. As do the Conservative party, whose government was entrusted to host Cop26 and made a huge fanfare about its importance in reaching the necessary climate action to stop the heating of our planet.” While Barker will step down as chair of the listed company, En+ said on Monday that it was considering carving out a large part of the aluminium business, which included the international business of Rusal, a part-owned subsidiary. The new company would be owned by management and non-Russian investors, and potentially led by Barker, according to a report by Bloomberg News that was referenced by EN+ in its stock market statement. En+, which mainly produces aluminium but also makes significant profits from coal and other commodities, escaped direct sanctions by the US in 2019 through a deal with the Office of Foreign Assets Control (Ofac) in which Deripaska’s stake was reduced to below 45%, and his voting rights were reduced to 35%. Barker received £6m in pay and bonuses in part as a reward for orchestrating the deal. Deripaska has sought to have the sanctions removed, and has consistently argued that he should not have been designated. A spokesperson for Deripaska said the US sanctions relied on “baseless accusations” and “false claims”. Deripaska has in recent days expressed opposition to war in Ukraine. According to Reuters, Deripaska said: “We need peace as soon as possible. The whole world will be different after these events and Russia will be different.” A source close to Barker said: “The heartbreaking situation in Ukraine and the terrible consequences that flow from it are bad enough without now trying to play politics with the climate agenda. “Lord Barker has a long history of climate activism, and while he stands by his decision to leave En+, he remains very proud of the progress he was able to achieve in helping one of the world’s largest producers of low carbon aluminium and hydropower lead the way into the low carbon economy. Pretending that all Russians are bad is, frankly, appalling.”",News/World news,"Tory peer attended Cop26 summit for Russia, UN list shows",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/tory-peer-cop26-climate-summit-russia-greg-barker
3/10/2022,"A children’s hospital and maternity ward in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol has been destroyed by a Russian airstrike this afternoon, Ukrainian officials say. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said children are buried under rubble and the regional governor said 17 people have been wounded. The Guardian could not independently verify this, but video published by the Associated Press showed multiple injured people at the site of the hospital attack. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of “holding 400,000 people hostage” in Mariupol. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the city, where conditions are described as “apocalyptic”, was still being shelled by Russian troops, despite an agreement to establish a safe evacuation corridor for civilians. Ukrainian authorities have said the power supply has been cut to the defunct Chernobyl power plant. The national power company Ukrenergo said it was impossible to restore the power lines because of fighting in the surrounding areas. The UN’s atomic watchdog said the spent nuclear fuel stored there had cooled down sufficiently for it not to be an imminent safety concern. Ukrainian authorities said earlier that humanitarian corridors should allow residents of the heavily bombarded cities of Mariupol, Enerhodar, Sumy, Izyum and Volnovakha, as well as towns around Kyiv including Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel, to leave, calling on Russian forces to respect an “official public commitment” to cease fire. But the Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko says Moscow has “largely failed” to adhere to these agreements. Civilians have been unable to leave Izyum because of continued Russian shelling in the eastern Kharkiv region, said the regional governor, Oleh Synyehubov, adding that buses intended to evacuate them were still waiting at the entrance to the town. Zelenskiy said the international community would be responsible for a mass “humanitarian catastrophe” if it did not agree a no-fly zone and warned that the country was at maximum threat level. In his daily televised address, he said Ukrainians had shown throughout the last two weeks that they would never give in. More than 3 million Ukrainians will need food assistance, the head of the World Food Programme said.

3/10/2022,"The Indianapolis Colts have traded quarterback Carson Wentz to the Washington Commanders for multiple mid-round draft picks, according to an ESPN report on Wednesday. Wentz spent the 2021 season with the Colts after four years with the Philadelphia Eagles. The Commanders will be taking on the entirety of Wentz’s contract for the 2022 season, including $28m in salary plus a $5m roster bonus due next week. It was not immediately clear what the Commanders sent to the Colts in their latest attempt for a franchise quarterback. ESPN reported two third-round picks were involved. Wentz, No 2 overall pick in the 2016 draft, spent one season as the Colts’ quarterback after Indianapolis traded a first- and third-round pick to acquire him in a February 2021 trade with the Philadelphia Eagles. He threw 27 touchdowns, matched a career low in interceptions with seven and appeared to have the Colts in line for a third playoff appearance in four years. But Indianapolis stumbled to back-to-back defeats in their final two regular-season games – needing only one of them to punch their postseason ticket – including a dismal 26-11 loss to the lowly Jacksonville Jaguars in their season finale.

3/10/2022,"Ministers are considering a climbdown to allow Ukrainians with temporary visas to bring relatives to the UK after Ukraine’s ambassador called for an easing of restrictions. Amid scenes of chaos and despair at a visa application centre in Poland, government insiders said Ukrainians in the UK on work and student visas might also be allowed to bring their relatives to the UK. The development came hours after Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s representative in London, told MPs he planned to ask Priti Patel why Ukrainians on temporary visas were not allowed to invite their family members to join them. At prime minister’s questions, Boris Johnson faced further demands for the government to speed up the system. So far, just 760 UK visas have been granted from a total of 2 million Ukrainians who have fled their homeland. According to a Whitehall source, the ambassador’s comments prompted a rethink. “There is movement on people with temporary visas, and the new plans should be released soon,” the Guardian was told. It emerged as police were called on Wednesday to calm “angry” crowds standing in freezing temperatures at a UK application centre in south-east Poland. People trying to apply for visas in Rzeszów were seen banging on the centre’s windows after children and elderly people were forced to queue in freezing temperatures. Police were called after staff told the crowds they were only able to process 100 applications a day. In Westminster, Prystaiko told MPs that 100,000 of his citizens could come to Britain to escape the Russian war machine and said he would be “happy” if visa requirements for Ukrainians were lifted. In a damning assessment of the UK’s immigration system, he called for a “simplified” process for refugees fleeing to the UK and disclosed that his own wife had struggled to get a visa before the Russia conflict. Asked by members of the home affairs select committee if he would like visa requirements to be waived altogether, in line with moves in the EU, he said: “That would definitely resolve all the issues, but how reasonable, how justified it is with your own system, that’s frankly for you to decide. “We will be happy if all the barriers are dropped for some period of time when we can get maximum [numbers] of people, then we will deal with that.” Prystaiko also called for an easing of the “bureaucratic” processes that were hampering asylum seekers’ attempts to come to the UK. He also addressed the allegations of racism at the borders, as black and Asian students attempted to flee the country. “It has been raised many times. Ukraine is a very homogenic society and not many people with different races on the streets. Foreigners do stick out of the crowd [but] it doesn’t mean we are racist,” he said. On Wednesday evening, David Cameron said the UK should be more generous in allowing Ukrainian refugees to come to Britain. The former prime minister told LBC’s Tonight with Andrew Marr: “Let’s find a way to get it done.” Earlier in the day, Johnson was criticised by members of his own party, with one senior Tory calling for a “reset” on the government’s approach to the refugee crisis. Julian Smith, a Conservative former chief whip, said: “I think people across the country are genuinely concerned about our response on refugees, on the bureaucracy, on the tone of our response.” His comments follow a string of Tory MPs attacking Patel on Tuesday over the government’s chaotic response to the crisis. Thousands of refugees have struggled to book appointments at British visa centres across Europe, with hundreds in Calais unable to cross the border. A visa centre being set up 75 miles away in Lille, northern France, to assist Ukrainian refugees will not offer appointments or walk-in access. It has emerged that Patel called Ireland’s justice minister, Helen McEntee, last week to raise concerns that the common travel area could prove to be a back door to Ukrainians and others who wanted to go to the UK. Ireland, in line with the EU protection programme, has lifted visa requirements for Ukrainians and offered them the right to work and live in the country for up to three years. The taoiseach, Micheál Martin, told the Irish parliament that McEntee had “pointed out” that Ireland was acting in concert with the EU and that meant waiving visa requirements. A UK government spokesperson said: “The UK stands shoulder to shoulder with the people of Ukraine and we have taken urgent action to process visas at speed for all those eligible to the Ukraine family scheme, while carrying out vital security checks. “We have protected appointments at all of our visa application centres to ensure there is sufficient capacity and deployed extra staff to help people through the process as quickly as possible.” They added: “We are increasing our capacity to meet this demand and will keep it under continuous review and increase further if needed. We have protected appointments for Ukrainians at Rzeszów and these are available to book – so people should book online rather than attempt a walk-in appointment.”",News/UK news,UK ministers considering climbdown on Ukraine visa restrictions,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/09/ukrainian-ambassador-calls-on-uk-to-simplify-process-for-refugees
3/10/2022,"Priceless artefacts, including ancient coins, paintings, furniture, musical instruments and statuettes, have been seized in a four-month police operation across 28 countries. More than 9,400 items were recovered and 52 people were arrested in an operation targeting illicit trafficking in cultural goods, carried out between June and September last year, Interpol said on Wednesday. More than 170 investigations are still ongoing, with more seizures and arrests expected as investigators “continue their pursuit of those spoiling and destroying cultural heritage”, the international criminal police operation said. Operation Pandora VI, led by Spain, involved actions in airports and at border crossing points, as well as in auction houses, museums and private homes. Online markets were monitored for suspicious sales. French customs officials seized 4,231 archaeological objects, including about 3,000 coins, as well as bells, buckles, rings and pieces of pottery which had been looted from archaeological sites by one individual using a metal detector. Separately, they also recovered three ancient statuettes dating back to the Tolita-Tumaco culture, whose people inhabited the area along the present day border between Colombia and Ecuador in the first millennium AD. Spanish police seized 91 Roman gold coins, looted from an archaeological site and worth an estimated half a million euros on the black market. Their investigation began when the coins were spotted at an auction house in Madrid. US customs and border protection officials recovered a shipment containing 13 Mexican artefacts from the post-classic to the Aztec era, including a skull and 12 adzes, or cutting tool. A 13th century processional cross was returned to the Evangelical Church Museum of Cisnadie, Romania. Police in the Netherlands recovered two Kees Verweij paintings which had been reported as stolen after investigating an online sales catalogue from an Amsterdam auction house. A marble column dating to the Roman period, and 13 ancient coins and three pottery vessels dating to the Hellenistic period, were seized by Greek police. Seven European law enforcement authorities recovered 90 metal detectors destined for illicit use at archaeological sites.

3/10/2022,"Speaking via a blurry video connection, the deputy mayor of Mariupol painted a grim picture of life and death on Wednesday inside his besieged city. Russian forces surrounded Mariupol a week ago. They have been shelling it “continuously” ever since, Sergiy Orlov said, in a call with the Guardian and other foreign media. “They have used aviation, artillery, multiple rocket launchers, grads and other types of weapons we don’t even know about. This isn’t simply treacherous. It’s a war crime and pure genocide,” he said. He added: “Vladimir Putin means to capture Mariupol whatever the human cost.” By way of evidence Orlov reeled off a list of civilian targets he said had so far been “annihilated”. They included numerous residential houses, Mariupol’s 600-bed maternity hospital number nine, the main administration service building, and the city’s giant Avostal metallurgical factory – once the workplace for 11,000 people. 1,170 people had been killed, he said. On Wednesday municipal workers buried 47 victims in a mass grave. “We couldn’t identify all of them,” Orlov said. The message from Moscow was chillingly clear, he suggested: “Putin intends to destroy Ukraine so he can have Ukraine without Ukrainians.” It is not currently possible to independently verify the toll nor the details of Orlov’s account. Putin’s goals, he said, were proceeding at a terrifying pace. The city has spent the last eight days without heat, power, gas, or electricity. The Russians parked up in tanks and armoured vehicles on Mariupol’s coastal outskirts had bombed all 15 power lines, Orlov said. On Monday they blew up the gas connection. “We sent a team of workers to repair the line. The Russians immediately shelled them. They had to leave,” he said. Consequently, the city’s 400,000 residents were living in freezing “medieval conditions”, unthinkable in what was until two weeks ago a modern and “flourishing” city, with busy cafes and restaurants. “The only way civilians can cook now is on open fires. People are fighting over firewood. They are happy that it’s cold and snowing. Snow means they have something to drink.” “A six-year-old girl died of dehydration,” Orlov continued bitterly. “This is Europe, in 2022. How can that happen?” He added: “A lot of districts are devastated. They are dropping half-tonne bombs from the sky.” Mariupol is one of several Ukrainian cities where Russia has promised to open so-called humanitarian corridors. The reality was the reverse, Orlov said. For the past five days Russia had shelled the agreed route and had even mined the road. It had set up a new checkpoint, he claimed, making evacuation to Zaporizhzhia – a city to the west under Ukrainian control – impossible. The deputy mayor estimated about 200,000 people wanted to get out of Mariupol. The authorities were only able to take out about 2,000 to 3,000 residents a day, he said, on a battered fleet of 21 municipal buses. The Russians had flattened the others. They targeted the assembly evacuation points, with citizens understandably reluctant to leave their shelters. Putin’s apparent dream of a “Russian world” minus Ukrainians was the product of a “sick imagination”, he said. He pointed out that Mariupol had always been a diverse multicultural city, home to Ukrainian and Russian speakers as well as ethnic Greeks and Armenians. All were Ukrainian citizens, he said, adding that nobody cared what language you spoke. “Half of those killed by Russian bombing are Russian-origin Ukrainians. This is Putin’s ‘peace’,” he said sardonically. The Ukrainian army would defend Mariupol until the last man, he said. If it did ultimately fall it would become a “ghost place”, he predicted, adding: “There is no Russian Mariupol. It’s going to be a desert.” From Kyiv, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, tweeted photos of the airstrike on Wednesday at Mariupol’s maternity hospital and said people and children lay buried under the wreckage. The Guardian was unable to verify the allegation, but video published by the Associated Press showed multiple injured people at the site of the hospital attack. Zelenskiy renewed his call – so far denied by Nato – for an immediate no-fly zone over Ukraine’s skies. The world was “losing its humanity”, he wrote. Mariupol. Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital. People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity. pic.twitter.com/FoaNdbKH5k Other photos taken from inside Mariupol over the past two days confirm a humanitarian disaster is taking place, with the EU, the US and the UK seemingly able to do nothing. They show blackened and destroyed apartment buildings, several still smouldering; burnt out cars; and streets filled with debris. Bodies lay on pavements covered by rugs or sheets. Local authorities still control the city centre. The worst shelling has taken place in western districts closest to Russian troops including Primorskiy and the port area, once home to Ukraine’s small Sea of Azov naval fleet. With little food left, desperate civilians have started looting shops, smashing glass and clambering through windows. The city has distributed bottled water to woman and children. Orlov said supplies of formula milk had run out, with about 3,000 babies unfed. Families are sleeping in freezing cellars. A few residents are able to charge mobile phones on city council generators. But for most contact with the outside world has stopped. Writing on Facebook, Mariupol resident Angela Timchenko said there was “no electricity, no communication, no gas, no medical care and no food. Looting is on the rise. There are crazy mums looking for food and nappies. Let’s help each other whenever possible.” She added: “Yesterday I was in the city. There were bonfires burning near all the houses and food was being prepared … To all who left our children to die, burn in hell. I heard a little boy ask his Mum: ‘Will the rockets spark today?’” Timchenko said she had lost 3.5kg and was running back and forth from her apartment on the eighth floor of a Mariupol block, where she lived with her family. “The baby understands if you raise your voice a little we need to run for cover,” she wrote poignantly. A few days ago, an activist Anatoliy Lozar had described conditions in Mariupol as “hell”. The city had become a new Stalingrad, he said. On Wednesday, calls to his two phones failed to connect. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, said Mariupol was “besieged by Russian invaders” and in dire need of help. Russia continues holding hostage over 400.000 people in Mariupol, blocks humanitarian aid and evacuation. Indiscriminate shelling continues. Almost 3.000 newborn babies lack medicine and food. I urge the world to act! Force Russia to stop its barbaric war on civilians and babies! “Mariupol is on the edge of humanitarian catastrophe. No humanitarian convoy can get to the city left without water, heating & electricity,” he tweeted. The humanitarian corridor did function in the north-eastern city of Sumy, where civilians were able to leave for a second day in a row. They were able to exit in private cars. Several hundred international students trapped by the fighting left on Tuesday in buses for Poltava, west of Kharkiv. For those who remained in Sumy conditions were grim. Its mayor Oleksandr Lysenko said since Monday Russia had carried out four indiscriminate bombing raids, which killed civilians and children. The latest attack in the darkness of Wednesday morning targeted a downtown residential area. “We managed to dig six people out, still alive, and a dog,” Lysenko said. Two convoys had managed to leave on Tuesday and were allowed to go through an enemy cordon. But the Russians used the second convoy as a human shield in order to advance their tanks, he said. “They shoot at civilian cars. Some cars get through, others don’t,” he said. “It’s a matter of luck.” He added: “They shoot at civilians trying to flee. The Russians have no humanity.”",News/World news,‘Pure genocide’: civilian targets in Mariupol ‘annihilated’ by Russian attacks,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/pure-genocide-civilian-targets-in-mariupol-annihilated-by-russian-attacks
3/10/2022,"Britain fears that Russia could be setting the stage to use a chemical weapon in Ukraine, after Kremlin officials alleged without firm evidence that the US had been supporting a bioweapons programme in the country. Western officials said at a briefing on Wednesday “we’ve got good reason to be concerned about possible use of non-conventional weapons” by Russia, reflecting the experience of chemical weapon use during the Syrian civil war. The concern arose partly because Russia’s foreign ministry had been engaged in “setting the scene” by making “false flag claims” about a biological weapons programme operating inside Ukraine. Earlier on Wednesday, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Russia had documents showing evidence that the US had supported a bioweapons programme in Ukraine, involving plague, cholera and anthrax. Washington and Kyiv both denied the claims, which the US said were “absurd”. Separately, Russia’s defence ministry accused “Ukrainian nationalists” of preparing a chemical weapons “provocation” in a village north-west of Kharkiv. The plan was to falsely accuse Russian forces of using chemical weapons, the ministry added. Western officials have repeatedly made warnings about Russia’s possible use of particularly lethal weapons over the past two weeks, such as thermobaric vacuum bombs which cause severe damage to human bodies because of the intensity of their explosive blasts. Such high-profile warnings from the west are as much designed to have a deterrent effect as they are based on any assessment that such weapons will actually be used. But Russia has shown an apparent willingness to target civilians in Ukrainian cities such as Kharkiv and Mariupol, as its initial invasion was slow in making progress. Direct attacks on civilians or civilian infrastructure are considered war crimes. The development, production and stockpiling and use of chemical weapons is banned by an international treaty signed by 193 countries. Chemical weapons have nevertheless been used on at least 17 occasions during Syria’s civil war, according to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which has accused the Russian-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad of being behind several high-profile attacks. In recent years, however, Russia, has sought to deny that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons – and in April 2018, without supporting evidence, accused Britain of being behind a chlorine attack in Douma that killed 40. But the fact that the chemical weapons involved were delivered through airstrikes led the OPCW to conclude the Syrian air force was responsible. Western officials believe that Russia’s military advance has been “very slow” in recent days, because of greater than expected Ukrainian resistance and poor planning and logistics on the part of Moscow. But they accept Russian forces are making gradual progress, and are trying to “tighten the noose” around Kyiv, the capital. One official said they believe the Russian army was “re-posturing and trying to learn lessons” as its forces advanced toward Kyiv from the east while also remaining in position to the north-west of the city. An attack on Kyiv would be “absolutely horrific” but no timeframe was put on whether it would be possible. Earlier this week, the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, said it believed Russian forces were gradually building up for an attack on Kyiv “in the coming 24-96 hours”. But it remains unclear if Moscow can concentrate enough force to begin an attack on the capital, which before the war had a population of 3 million.",News/World news,Britain fears Russia could be setting stage to use chemical weapons,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/britain-fears-russia-could-be-setting-stage-to-use-chemical-weapons
3/10/2022,"The government has been accused of “looking after their own” after choosing a former Tory party candidate with links to a rightwing thinktank as its preferred candidate for the chair of the charities’ watchdog. Labour said by seeking to appoint Orlando Fraser, a founding fellow of the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ), to the chair of the Charity Commission, ministers had ignored due process in favour of another Conservative supporter. There was also a lukewarm response to the choice from the charity sector, with the National Council for Voluntary Organisations saying it was “disappointed” ministers had failed to appoint someone “with full political independence”. Fraser is likely to be subjected to a grilling when he appears before the parliamentary committee set up to scrutinise public appointments in the next few weeks. The committee is already furious about what it has called the “shambles” of an appointment process that has seen the commission without a chair for a year. Labour’s shadow culture secretary, Lucy Powell MP, said: “The chair of the Charity Commission is an important post, and the public must have confidence that this role is independent, not party political, and that there is no conflict of interest in investigations the Commission carries out. Instead, this is another case of the Tories looking after their own.” The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, opted for Fraser after her previous choice, Martin Thomas, resigned four days before he was due to take up post in December after a controversy surrounding his past stewardship of a women’s charity. She appears not to have reopened the appointment process before appointing Fraser. The charity watchdog role was pulled into a “culture wars” political controversy last year after the previous culture secretary Oliver Dowden said its next chair should be prepared to pursue charities which stray into so-called “woke” and “political” activities. Fraser was on the board of the Charity Commission from 2013-17 under Sir William Shawcross when it attracted criticism from the charity sector over its perceived politicisation. Several members of the board were said to have close links to Tory MPs and rightwing thinktanks. In 2016 Fraser was named in a court case after the commission’s attempt to prevent UK charitable foundations from funding Cage, a lobby group supporting people accused of terrorism, was challenged. The commission withdrew its attempted prohibition, with Cage arguing the regulator had overstepped its regulatory powers. Fraser, a commercial barrister, stood unsuccessfully for the Conservative party in north Devon in 2005. He subsequently helped draw up the CSJ’s Breakdown Britain report, which became an inspiration for Tory policy on the voluntary sector. He has not declared any party political activity in the past five years. Educated at Ampleforth school and Cambridge University, Fraser is the son of the author Lady Antonia Fraser and the late Tory MP Sir Hugh Fraser. His stepfather was the playwright Harold Pinter and his grandfather the late prison reformer and Labour peer Lord Longford.

3/10/2022,"Treasury officials trying to stop fraudsters making off with vast Covid loans have been called a “Dad’s Army operation” by a former Tory minister who condemned the lacklustre bid to stop “suitcases of cash leaving the country”. Lord Agnew, who quit as the government’s anti-fraud minister earlier this year, said the first few months of taxpayer-funded emergency loans being issued were “happy days for crooks”. In an eviscerating assessment of the government’s attempt to avoid the loans being given to untraceable companies, Agnew said he was “genuinely completely dumbfounded” why the operation was not properly resourced. He revealed it took officials six weeks to create a system that could catch fraudsters making duplicate claims for the loans, which were designed to keep businesses afloat. However, he added by that time “60% of the money had already gone out of the door”. He recalled: “I was writing letters of congratulations to Border Force staff for picking up suitcases of cash leaving the country. “It was happy days if you were a crook in those first few months.” Out of a potential 100,000 fraud cases, Agnew said just 49 had resulted in arrest – a figure he branded a “disgrace”. He claimed the economic crime bill, passed by MPs on Monday, was a “start” but only fixed around a quarter of the problems that needed solving in tackling serious offences, such as money laundering. Agnew admitted he was “very worried” that ministers would claim the bill would solve all the issues and warned that would be an “absolute tragedy”. In a direct attack on the most senior civil servant in the Treasury – the department in which Agnew used to be a minister – he also said that a letter he received from Tom Scholar “embodies everything about the complacency that grips the civil service”. It comes two months after the Treasury confirmed it had written off £4.3bn worth of the £5.8bn of fraud witnessed across its Covid business loan schemes. Agnew said he quit because he was asked to defend the move, but decided he “could not stand up with any great integrity and say that we’d done a great job, because we hadn’t”. Speaking to the Treasury select committee on Wednesday, Agnew said the Back Bounce Loan Scheme was an “important intervention” to help keep small and medium-sized firms afloat when tough restrictions were in place that forced them to close. “We had to get the money out quickly to legitimate businesses and give them the support they needed,” he said. “But on the fraud side it was just a Dad’s Army operation.” Agnew said the economic crime bill – heralded by the government as a key move to help tackle dirty money being laundered in the UK – was a start, but added: “This shouldn’t really be called an economic crime bill, because it’s about tightening up some Land Registry disclosures … “This only deals with probably 25% of what needs to be done. The Companies House situation is simply terrifying – the gaping holes that exist there in terms of their inability to carry out any proper anti-money-laundering checks on people applying for a company.” Agnew also said the head of fraud at the British Business Bank had recently “resigned out of frustration because she was not getting supported” in bids to ensure “a much harder set of reporting standards from the banks”. He also dismissed as “total drivel” and a “classic fob off” explanations by the government about why it would not publish a list of the businesses that received loans. The Treasury has been contacted for comment.",News/Politics,‘Happy days if you were a crook’: former minister slams UK Covid loan scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/09/uk-covid-loans-happy-days-crooks-former-minister
3/10/2022,"Sajid Javid is expected to back the scrapping of passenger locator forms for all international arrivals in England before Easter, the Guardian has learned. The health secretary has acquiesced to pressure from the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, and Tory MPs concerned about the requirement, which has remained despite domestic restrictions having been rolled back. Currently, all travellers – apart from those arriving on internal flights or journeys that began in Ireland, the Channel Islands and Isle of Man – must complete a passenger locator form before beginning their journey to the UK. The form became a requirement when border controls were much stricter and allowed officials to ensure people complied with quarantine rules. It has been simplified over time, but the Ryanair boss, Michael O’Leary, complained that scrapping the forms was long overdue. He called them “completely irrelevant” because “nobody collects them, nobody checks them or follows up on them”. Javid, Shapps and other senior ministers are expected to sign off on the decision to scrap the forms at a meeting of the Covid operations committee next Monday. A government source said the “expectation is to remove all remaining Covid border measures” and speculated that the requirement for unvaccinated travellers to get tested on arrival could also be dropped. After the public row over Novak Djokovic’s vaccination status which culminated in his removal from Australia, the source noted it could mean the tennis player would be able to attend Wimbledon this summer. Others doubted that Javid would back the move to end the testing requirement, particularly given the wider Covid backdrop, with cases and hospitalisations both rising. Prof Denis Kinane, an immunologist and founder of Cignpost Diagnostics, said it was “very concerning” that the testing rule could be changed. He added: “Any move to scrap testing for unvaccinated travellers will hinder our ability to detect new variants and to analyse the mutation of the virus.” Changes to the travel rules could come into effect in time for the Easter holidays next month, to allow families to travel abroad and return more easily. Huw Merriman, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons transport select committee, said he and colleagues were pushing for the forms to be dropped, adding that the Department for Transport “cannot see the point of it”. He told the Business Travel Association’s spring conference earlier this month: “We don’t need restrictions domestically so why the heck do we need to be asking all these questions of people when they come back into the country?” He added: “It’s our job to put it to the prime minister and then ultimately to try and get it [the form] dropped by Easter, which I’m pretty confident we’ll do. We have to constantly chip away. It’s slower than I’d like – but we do get there.” The travel industry has been one of the heaviest hit by Covid restrictions. While its supporters concede the passenger locator form is a relatively small measure they do not think puts many people off travelling, they are keen to clear up the disparity between some rules existing for international arrivals and the lack of any domestic restrictions.",News/Politics,Javid expected to back scrapping of locator forms for England arrivals,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/09/javid-expected-back-scrapping-passenger-locator-forms-england-arrivals
3/10/2022,"The Cardiff Philharmonic Orchestra is facing ridicule after removing the Russian composer Tchaikovsky from its forthcoming programme due to the conflict in Ukraine. Tchaikovsky’s 1812 overture, which celebrates Russia’s victory against the invasion of Napoleon, was due to be included in the orchestra’s upcoming Tchaikovsky concert at St David’s Hall on 18 March, but the entire programme has been abandoned due to events in Ukraine. A statement on the venue’s website said: “In light of the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, Cardiff Philharmonic Orchestra, with the agreement of St David’s Hall, feel the previously advertised programme including the 1812 overture to be inappropriate at this time. The orchestra hope you will continue to support them and enjoy the revised programme.” The 1812 overture was written to celebrate Russia’s defence against Napoleon’s army and is notable for featuring a volley of cannon fire. The orchestra will instead present a programme centred around Dvořák’s symphony No 8. It will also include John Williams’s the Cowboys overture and a performance of Elgar’s Enigma variations in the second half. The Cardiff Philharmonic’s moves comes after the Russian conductor Valery Gergiev was dropped by his management after his refused to condemn the regime of Vladimir Putin. The treatment of Gergiev prompted some disquiet among rightwing commentators but the decision to cancel Tchaikovsky has been more widely derided in both the UK and the US. The comedian Geoff Norcott tweeted: “Cancelling a Tchaikovsky concert is so daft ordinary Russians will write it off as mad Vlad overdoing the propaganda.” Cancelling a Tchaikovsky concert is so daft ordinary Russians will write it off as mad Vlad over-doing the propaganda. Cellist Max Weiss, editor of Baltimore magazine, said “everyone needs to get a grip”. Writing on Twitter she said: “We had our HSO concert on Saturday. We began the program, fittingly, with the Ukraine National Anthem. We then went on to play Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1.” We had our HSO concert on Saturday. We began the program, fittingly, with the Ukraine National Anthem. We then went on to play Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1. Everyone needs to get a grip. https://t.co/SAWFGjTxyJ Matt Duss, the foreign policy adviser to former US presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, said that the orchestra’s move was “doubly absurd because Tchaikovsky spent a lot of time in Ukraine, and incorporated a lot of Ukrainian folk music and stories into his work”. Doubly absurd because Tchaikovsky spent a lot of time in Ukraine, and incorporated a lot of Ukrainian folk music and stories into his work. https://t.co/mhF5l6HaNm Former MP turned talk show host George Galloway described the move as the equivalent to “fascistic book-burning”. Many have pointed out Tchaikovsky shunned nationalism. Billy Binion, editor of the US magazine Reason, tweeted: “The irony. Tchaikovsky was one of the first (and only) composers to eschew Russian nationalism and try to integrate his music with the west. Also, he died over a century ago. We’ve lost our minds. Tchaikovsky composed some of the richest, most affecting music I’ve ever heard. We need more of that in times like these, not less.”",News/UK news,Cardiff Philharmonic Orchestra removes Tchaikovsky over Ukraine conflict,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/09/cardiff-philharmonic-orchestra-removes-tchaikovsky-over-ukraine-conflict
3/10/2022,"Russian bombs have “completely destroyed” a children’s and maternity hospital in Mariupol, Ukrainian authorities have said, as shelling again halted mass evacuations from several cities, including the devastated southern port where conditions are described as “apocalyptic”. As Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmitryo Kuleba, accused Russia of “holding 400,000 people hostage” in Mariupol, much of whose population has been without power, heat, water or phone signal for over a week, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, denounced an atrocity. “Mariupol. Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital,” Zelenskiy tweeted. “People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Stop the killings! You have the power but you seem to be losing humanity.” Amid western warnings that Moscow’s invasion was about to become even more brutal as the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, seeks to regain stalled momentum, local authorities described the damage to the hospital –a combined 600-bed complex with children’s and maternity wards – as “colossal” and said at least 17 people had been wounded, including women in labour. The deputy mayor, Sergei Orlov, said the city was being shelled continiously and 1,170 residents had died, 47 of whom were buried in a mass grave on Wednesday. “It’s medieval,” he said. “It’s pure genocide. The attack isn’t simply treacherous. It’s a war crime. They are attacking us with aviation, shells, multiple rocket launchers.” The Guardian was unable to fully verify the Ukrainian officials’ accounts, but video published by the Associated Press showed multiple injured people at the site of the hospital attack. The Red Cross has described conditions in the port city as “apocalyptic”, while deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the situation was “catastrophic” and Zelenskiy compared the devastation and suffering there to that caused by the Nazis. Journalists have described corpses lying unburied in the streets and hungry residents breaking into stores in search of food and melting snow for water, while thousands sheltered in basements. The Russian army had also “shot and bombed” a humanitarian corridor agreed with Moscow and intended to allow civilians a safe route out, the deputy mayor of the city said, mined the road, and installed a checkpoint. Of an estimated 200,000 people desperate to leave, only 2,000 to 3,000 a day were able to. Ukrainian authorities said earlier the corridors should allow residents of the heavily bombarded cities of Mariupol, Enerhodar, Sumy, Izyum and Volnovakha, as well as towns around Kyiv including Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel, to leave, calling on Russian forces to respect an “official public commitment” to cease fire. The governor of Sumy, from which 7,000 civilians – including 1,700 foreign students – managed to flee on Tuesday, said civilian cars were driving out of the north-eastern city along the same safe route to Poltava, further to the west, with priority for pregnant women, women with children, and elderly and disabled people. But while the mayor of Enerhodar in the north-west said a convoy of mainly vulnerable civilians had been evacuated from the city, and Kyiv’s deputy mayor said authorities hoped to help some more people escape from Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, there was little evidence the corridors were working elsewhere. Civilians were unable to evacuate from Izyum because of continued Russian shelling in the eastern Kharkiv region, said the regional governor, Oleh Synyehubov, adding that buses intended to evacuate them were still waiting at the entrance to the town. Zelenskiy said on Wednesday the threat level against the country was “at the maximum” and again called on the west to impose a no-fly zone, saying it risked a “humanitarian catastrophe” if it did not. Speaking in Washington, the US secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, and British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, reiterated the Nato position that a no-fly zone would bring Nato into direct conflict with Russia. The head of the UN’s refugee agency UNHCR, Filippo Grandi, said on Wednesday that up to 2.2 million people had fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. The head of the UN’s World Food Programme said it expects to have to help more than 3 million refugees from Ukraine with food donations. With food becoming an increasingly urgent concern inside the country, Ukraine’s government on Wednesday banned wheat exports that are critical to global food supplies in an attempt to ward off food shortages and hunger. Amid international alarm over the safety of Ukraine’s nuclear plants, several of which are now in Russian hands, Kyiv called for a ceasefire to allow the electricity supply to be restored to Chernobyl, saying the defunct plant had been disconnected from the grid. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukrainian forces had attacked power lines in a “dangerous provocation”. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), however, said the loss of power at the plant did not have an imminent impact on safety – although it said it was very concerned about the lack of staff rotation at the plant, which requires constant management to prevent another nuclear disaster. As fighting continued across the country, Ukraine’s general staff said on Wednesday its armed forces were building up defences in cities in the north, south and east, and that forces around Kyiv were “holding the line” and resisting an apparently stalled Russian offensive with unspecified strikes. The British Ministry of Defence said in its latest assessment of the military situation that fighting north-west of Kyiv was “ongoing” and Russian forces were “failing to make any significant breakthroughs”. The ministry’s assessment said the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol “remain encircled and continue to suffer heavy Russian shelling”. The British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said Russia’s assault was set to become “more brutal and more indiscriminate”. Three rounds of peace talks between the two sides have so far yielded no progress, with Moscow continuing to insist Ukraine must “demilitarise” and enshrine neutrality in its constitution before it halts what it calls a “special military operation” aimed at ensuring Russia’s security. Moscow insisted on Wednesday it would prefer to reach its goals through negotiation. The foreign ministry in Moscow repeated allegations the US was supporting a military biological programme in Ukraine involving deadly pathogens including plague, cholera and anthrax, claiming Russian forces had uncovered evidence of the alleged programme. Washington and Kyiv have strongly denied the claims, which the US has previously described as “absurd” misinformation. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, was due to meet his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, and the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, on the sidelines of a summit being hosted on Wednesday in the resort city of Antalya by Turkey, a Nato member. Russia said on Wednesday that it was working on a “broad response” to an unprecedented range of international financial and economic sanctions that appear certain to plunge Russia’s economy into its gravest crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.",News/World news,"Children under rubble after Russian airstrike on maternity hospital, says Zelenskiy",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/ukraine-mariupol-civilians-russia-war
3/10/2022,"In February 2018, the British foreign secretary declared: “It makes sense for us to continue to be intimately involved in European foreign and security policy.” But when he became prime minister he took foreign and security policy cooperation off the table in Brexit negotiations. Inconsistency is not rare in Boris Johnson’s record. Two years before that 2018 speech, during the referendum campaign, he was singing a different tune, blaming the EU’s association agreement with Ukraine for provoking Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Mr Johnson claimed Brussels was meddling beyond its competence and could only “cause confusion”. Mr Johnson dropped formal partnership with the EU on security issues in pursuit of a “clean” Brexit – an arm’s-length relationship based on trade in goods and not much else. The official foreign policy doctrine was “global Britain”, with no special interest in Europe. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has shown that approach to be petty and futile. Vladimir Putin’s military aggression has landed on one country, but his strategic hostility is directed at the two institutions that have historically underpinned democracy in Europe: Nato and the EU. The UK’s commitment to the former is unbending, which is often cited by Brexiters as proof of a European commitment that doesn’t have to be channelled through Brussels. That is true, up to a point. Brexit has not stopped the UK being proactive in support of Ukraine. British suspicion of Russian motives and readiness to turn solidarity with Poland and the Baltics into military aid has gone further than in most EU member states, and been vindicated by events. UK military capability, matched only by France on the continent, will always be a vital asset to the whole of Europe. By contrast, on sanctions against Mr Putin’s cronies, the EU has moved faster than Britain – in part because the relevant laws were in a mess post-Brexit. That is not to romanticise the European response or overstate continental unity. An EU summit in Versailles on Thursday is meant to discuss “decisive steps” towards reinforcing a “sovereign” Europe with an explicit strategy to reduce dependency on Russian energy exports. How that is done in practice and to what timetable is not easy to agree when some states, Germany the biggest among them, are heavily reliant on Russian gas. That, in turn, raises questions about how the transition will be funded, which reopens divisions over fiscal integration that were papered over in the first days of the crisis. Those issues will get harder still as the economic cost of maintaining political and military solidarity with Ukraine rises. Populists in EU states who once openly admired Mr Putin have distanced themselves from his butchery, but not suddenly embraced liberal pluralism. The European project has been given momentum in reaction to Russian aggression, but the direction is not clear. Britain, being intimately bound to Europe’s economy and security concerns, has a huge stake in the outcome of that discussion, but surrendered its seat at the table where it happens. That was a mistake. It will not be reversed, but it can be mitigated. There is no great national appetite for relitigating the Brexit arguments that raged from 2016 onwards, but it should be possible to recognise that the world has changed enough to drop some of the delusional Eurosceptic mythologies that characterised those arguments. For the foreseeable future, British interests will require institutional partnership with the EU on the level of foreign and security policy. Mr Johnson was right about that once, then took a wrong turn. Now would be an auspicious time to correct the course.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on EU-UK relations: war requires a reset | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/09/the-guardian-view-on-eu-uk-relations-war-requires-a-reset
3/10/2022,"At the start of the week, the Home Office boasted of unprecedented action, declaring breathlessly: “The UK government’s Ukraine family scheme is the first visa scheme in the world to launch since President Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.” It was a telling assertion, not only because it is the sort of casually misleading claim we have grown used to from the home secretary, Priti Patel, and Boris Johnson, but also because it expresses a broader truth about the UK’s treatment of refugees. The statement was factually true – but only because Ukrainians do not need visas to enter the European Union, and the UK had to be strong-armed into broadening its restrictive definition of “close relatives”. More than 2 million people have escaped the war, but the UK has accepted only 760 of 22,000 applications so far. A second scheme, yet to begin, will allow individuals and organisations to sponsor Ukrainians – again, cherrypicking victims of war rather than respecting the international convention setting out their rights. Ms Patel spoke of a new humanitarian route, only for Downing Street to swiftly rule that out. As with the asylum system overall, the approach is grudging, inefficient and overly bureaucratic, in large part because it is designed to keep people out. What meagre help is being offered has been dogged by confusion and contradiction. The home secretary promised she had “surged a Home Office team” to help at Calais, but families who had travelled over a thousand miles found a few officials giving out packets of crisps, and were told to go to Paris or Brussels to apply. Then a new “pop-up” centre in Lille, still 70 miles from Calais, was announced; it now appears that it will neither take walk-in applications nor offer appointments but deal with biometrics for the “most vulnerable” of these traumatised people. One Ukrainian mother and daughter made eight trips to the UK visa processing centre in Paris, two trips to the British consulate there and one trip to the British embassy. Even after obtaining the correct visas, they were detained for a second time by UK Border Force officials in Calais. Plenty of refugees could testify to the incompetence and inhumanity of the UK’s asylum system. The difference this time is that across Europe, including in places previously extremely hostile to migrants and refugees, there is greater public sympathy for white Europeans fleeing their homes. The meanness of the UK government’s approach is not new; it is more visible this time, however, because it is not only out of step with domestic public opinion but strikingly at odds with the welcome now offered by other nations. Moldova, one of the poorest countries in Europe, with a population of just 4 million, has taken more than 80,000 Ukrainians. The UK’s failure to help Ukrainian refugees is not an accident, though its ineptitude has worsened the plight of many. It is possible to have a humane and efficient asylum system, but not when you promote stereotypes of refugees as a threat and a burden. The government has closed off safe routes – while its nationality and borders bill seeks to criminalise those who arrive here by irregular means. Ukrainians are the latest victims of its cruelty.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the UK’s shameful treatment of Ukrainians: not an accident | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/09/the-guardian-view-on-the-uks-shameful-treatment-of-ukrainians-not-an-accident
3/10/2022,"Waitrose and Aldi are to stop selling disposable BBQs because of their impact on the natural environment and wildlife. As the weather gets hotter, British people flock to the supermarket to buy the foil devices so they can sit in parks or gardens and sizzle sausages. But many have raised environmental concerns, with national parks, including the New Forest, banning disposable barbecues because of the risk of wildfires. In addition, the devices usually contain charcoal, which is normally not sustainably sourced, leading to deforestation, as well as single-use plastic. They cannot be recycled or composted, meaning that for each one sold in the UK – where sales are estimated at more than a million each year – new waste is committed to landfill. Aldi has stopped selling them, which will save approximately 35 tonnes of single-use waste packaging a year. Liz Fox, corporate responsibility director at Aldi UK, said: “We are committed to reducing our impact on the environment and know that many of our shoppers are increasingly looking to do the same. “We hope customers can embrace our latest move and still want them to enjoy their summer picnics and barbecues. As an alternative, we would encourage customers to opt for more environmentally friendly and sustainable options such as mini portable barbecues, ensuring they are used responsibly.” All Waitrose stores will stop selling the disposable grills before summer. They estimate this will save about 70,000 disposable barbecues from being sold a year, saving 73.5 tonnes of foil and 11.2 tonnes of shrink-wrap plastic being produced a year. Lucy Comer, buying assistant at Waitrose, said: “Disposable barbecues present a risk to our natural habitats and this is why we’ve committed to removing them from our shelves this year. This is the right thing to do to preserve our local ecosystems and another example of the work we’re doing to protect the planet. We applaud Aldi for standing with us to make this happen and we hope other retailers will follow.” The government has welcomed the decision. Amanda Craig, director of people and nature at Natural England, said: “We welcome any step that helps people act more responsibly while enjoying the countryside, and encourage everyone to follow the countryside code when spending time outdoors. This includes only using barbecues in places where signs specify they are permitted, to better protect people, property and wildlife”.",News/Environment,Waitrose and Aldi to stop selling disposable barbecues,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/09/waitrose-and-aldi-to-stop-selling-disposable-bbqs
3/10/2022,"The Order of Friendship of the Russian Federation is a star-shaped golden medal, encrusted with blue enamel, showing a map of the world. Last year, as Russia was beginning to ration supplies of gas to Europe and Vladimir Putin was planning his assault on Ukraine, Roger Munnings announced he had been named as the medal’s latest recipient. The former long-serving head of KPMG’s Russian operations, Munnings is a director of three firms of major strategic importance Putin’s regime: Lukoil, Nornickel and the banking to telecoms conglomerate Sistema. Munnings is a busy man. As well as his three directorships – which pay out an estimated $707,000 (£537,370) a year combined, according to company filings – he also heads the Russo-British Chamber of Commerce, which promotes closer ties between the two countries. Now, these ties are fast unravelling as western governments tighten sanctions on Moscow and businesses cut all dealings with Russia. Scores of directors have relinquished roles in the 35 Russian firms suspended from the London Stock Exchange last week, and there have been departures from a clutch of other Russian controlled companies with their main listings in the UK capital. The exodus began after the Institute of Directors urged Britons to uphold their “moral duty”, with the clarion call: leave now. While many have heeded the call, Munnings, who lived in Russia for more than a decade, is staying put. He did not respond to requests to comment on his decision. Outrage over the war in Ukraine has forced a moral dilemma on companies and left time-honoured governance mechanisms in shreds. Several boards face the potential problem of not having sufficient numbers left to make decisions in the proper way. The momentum driving the departures heightened when the Conservative peer and former UK energy minister Greg Barker on Monday quit as the executive chair of EN+, the metals group part-owned by the sanctioned Russian Oleg Deripaska, after intense political pressure. Joan MacNaughton, an influential climate change figure who joined EN+ in 2019, had already stepped down from the board on Friday. The gold and silver producer Polymetal announced on Monday the resignations of six directors, including the British chair and mining veteran Ian Cockerill. He received an annual fee of $544,000 in 2021 – up from $483,000 the year before, the 2021 company report shows. Four directors left the board of Russian supermarket chain Lenta, after the billionaire Alexei Mordashov, who has a majority stake in the London-listed company, was put on the EU sanctions list last week. Headed by Vladimir Kiriyenko, who was sanctioned by the US for his links to the Kremlin, the social media site VK Group was hit by six of its directors resigning in only three days. They include VK’s managing director and chief financial officer, Matthew Hammond. On Friday, James Rutherford stepped down as a non-executive director of the Roman Abramovich-backed Russian steelmaker Evraz, which dropped out of the FTSE 100 last week after investors sold out in droves and the share price plunged by 68% following the invasion of Ukraine. Evraz, which announced a dividend worth $450m to Abramovich, has so far not been hit by the sanctions targeting firms with strong links to Russia and it retains a number of British directors. Other British directors, including one with connections to the royal family, remain at Evraz. Sir Michael Peat, the accountant and former private secretary to the Prince of Wales, retains his seat, for which he earned $214,000 last year, according to the annual report. So does the ex-Ford Motor Company executive Stephen Odell ($138,000), and the former Deloitte director Deborah Gudgeon ($322,000). They did not respond to a request for comment. The moral turmoil is also hitting companies that are not focused on Russia. Uladzimir Boltach, a British national originally from Belarus, last week left his 14-year post as operations director of a Belarusian autorecycling firm with an office in Lancashire because of Belarus’s indirect involvement in the war. “It was one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever made. I helped organise aid to Ukraine and thought it was my moral obligation to change the course of my career. “I still remember my grandmother who was shot in the leg during the second world war telling me stories about Germany invading Belarus. Nobody in Belarus wants this to come back again and it is heartbreaking to see what 10 days of war has done to Ukraine and its people.” Carl Hughes, who specialised in the energy industry during his career at Deloitte and remains as an EN+ board member and chair of the audit committee, has taken a very different stance to Boltach, putting up a strong defence of his decision to stay in his $264,000-a-year post. Hughes said: “25,000 employees of EN+ are located outside of Russia, including 4,000 employees at the group’s alumina refinery in Ukraine. Providing practical financial support to our Ukrainian workforce has been a key focus over the past fortnight. “My current focus is on my fiduciary duty to the group and its shareholders, and also to its employees and customers, all of which extend well beyond Russia.” Xavier Rolet, ex-chief of the LSE, is another Russia remainer. He still sits on the board of the fertiliser firm PhosAgro as an independent director. The mining firm Severstal still features two Britons on its board, Christopher Clark and Martin Angle, despite the resignation of other directors Philip Dayer and Alun Bowen, following the EU sanction on Mordashov, Severstal’s chairman. Robert Edwards is holding fast on the board of Nornickel, the world’s largest nickel producer, which counts the Russian billionaire Vladimir Potanin as its controlling shareholder. At Polyus, Russia’s biggest gold producer controlled by the US-sanctioned executive Suleiman Kerimov, there remain two British directors on the board: Alexandra Maria Beckwith, and Tony Antoniou, who also works for MTS, Russia’s largest mobile network provider that is majority-owned by Sistema. They were approached for comment. The Queen’s cousin Prince Michael of Kent is for now still listed as a patron of the Russo-British Chamber of Commerce, although this week his spokesperson confirmed he had handed back his Order of Friendship medal to the Kremlin. All eyes are now on Munnings, who has much more than a medal to lose from this conflict.",News/World news,‘My moral duty’: directors quit Russian firms over Ukraine crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/the-moral-dilemma-facing-britons-on-russian-boards-ukraine
3/10/2022,"Krzysztof Mikucki was so enraged by the treatment of his Ukrainian family by UK Border Force staff in Calais at 1am on Wednesday that he struggled to find words to articulate his fury. “They treated us worse than the water in the toilet,” the Polish builder said finally, standing by the entrance to the ferry port hours later with his Ukrainian wife, Alona, sister-in-law Juliia, a speech therapist, mother-in-law Olga and their dog, Garik, considering what to do next. Mikucki’s relatives are among about 600 Ukrainians who have been turned away by British border officials in Calais in the past 10 days at the end of a 2,000-mile journey fleeing Russia’s invasion of their country. Many are staying in a crowded youth hostel in the French port city, trying to secure visa appointments in Paris and Brussels, upset and angry to have been forced to halt their already gruelling odyssey while they work out how to reroute to satisfy UK visa requirements. On Tuesday night all the rooms in the youth hostel were full. One man who had spent seven days driving across Europe with his family from the heavily shelled city of Kharkiv, and who had also been turned back at the UK border control, spent the night sleeping outside the building, squeezed into his car with his wife and six children aged two to 16. At about 7am the next day he wound down his window and would only say: “Things are very bad for us.” Natacha Bouchart, the Calais mayor, visited the youth hostel to voice strong criticism of Britain’s refusal to lift visa requirements for Ukrainians. “The British authorities are not displaying a humanitarian attitude,” she said. “It is not enough to say that they are welcoming Ukrainian refugees, they need to put everything in place to make it technically possible for them to secure visas, or provisionally cancel the need for a visa and create a system that would allow them to apply on arrival in the UK.” Some families staying at the youth hostel were politely puzzled at the UK immigration officials’ failure to be more helpful, others were despairingly incredulous, but Mikucki was shouting with fury, exhausted after his 4,000-mile round-trip to Ukraine and not quite home. After picking his relatives up from the Romanian border, Mikucki had hoped to take them by ferry to Dover and then to his home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, but they were held at British passport control for four and a half hours. Officials finally concluded that the family would need to leave the port and apply for visas. “The Border Force staff were chatting about their houses, laughing, while we sat on a bench waiting. At 5.30am they just gave us a piece of paper with a phone number on it,” Mikucki said. His mother-in-law Olga’s house in Mykolaiv, southern Ukraine, was shelled by Russian forces on Friday and she fled with her belongings packed into a suitcase. She seemed still in shock, and surprised to have been turned away at the border. “It feels hurtful at a time when we are so in need of support,” she said. French police helped the family to find a hotel, where they slept for five hours before returning to the port to seek guidance from a hastily set up Home Office advice centre – staffed by seven workers, who are unable to process visas and seemed equipped to do little more than counsel Ukrainians on whether they should drive back to Paris or divert to Brussels. There were no Ukrainian translators to help the many people who were struggling with the visa application form, which is available only in English. British officials said they had turned away 50-60 people at the Calais border every day since the conflict erupted because they did not have a visa. A small new visa application centre will open on Thursday in Lille but UK officials are still encouraging Ukrainians to head to Paris or Brussels to make applications, and said appointments were available. Asked to respond to the refugees’ frustration, officials said that since there was a visa scheme in operation, applications had to be processed, but they were trying to speed up the system. The Home Office said it had now issued 850 visas to Ukrainians seeking to join family in the UK and was processing 22,000 applications. Officials have said they do not want to set up a visa processing centre in Calais, to avoid encouraging more refugees to travel to the city, which has for years been a gathering place for people hoping to seek asylum in the UK. Refugee charities in Calais said there were no Ukrainians staying in the informal camps occupied by people from Syria, Afghanistan, Sudan and Iraq. Volunteers have pointed to a double standard in the way Ukrainian refugees were being housed and fed by the French government, compared with the more hostile treatment meted out to those fleeing other conflicts. On Wednesday afternoon French officials brought two buses to the youth hostel and drove about 40 Ukrainian refugees to hostels in other cities, but they would not reveal where. Misha Raminishvili, a British scaffolder from Hornchurch in east London trying to bring his Ukrainian family to safety, received a phone call saying a visa appointment in Belgium would be brought forward by five days – after he spoke to the BBC and the Sun. “I was angry when we were turned away,” he said, helping his son, six, and stepdaughter, 16, into the car to set off on the three-hour drive to Brussels. “Now I’m tired. I understand they weren’t as prepared as they should have been, everything takes time. I feel disappointed to be honest.” He was still not clear how long it would take to get home because officials said processing the visa could take up to five days. Mohamed Sheet, an economics student, and Vitalia Sheeta, a shop assistant, were distraught to have been turned away at the UK border after a difficult journey from Kyiv, hoping to join an uncle in Manchester. “We’re trying to work out how to get from here to Paris. It’s so confusing,” she said.

3/10/2022,"The Endurance left South Georgia for Antarctica on 5 December 1914. Onboard were 27 crew members plus a stowaway, 69 dogs and one cat. Sir Ernest Shackleton, the expedition leader, was aiming to establish a base on Antarctica’s Weddell Sea coast and then keep going to the Ross Sea on the other side of the continent. Within two days, the ship encountered the barrier of thick sea ice around the Antarctic continent. For several weeks, the Endurance made painstaking progress, but in mid-January a gale pushed the ice floes hard against one another and the ship was stuck – “frozen like an almond in the middle of a chocolate bar”, according to a crew member, Thomas Orde-Lees. The men could do nothing but wait. After nine months of being beset in ice, they abandoned the badly damaged ship, decamping on to the ice. From the ship they took food, bibles, books, clothing, tools, keepsakes and – crucially – three open lifeboats. The cat and some of the dogs were shot. A few weeks later, on 21 November 1915, almost a year after they had set out, the Endurance finally sank. Using basic navigational tools, Frank Worsley, the ship’s captain and navigator, recorded its location. Without that information, it would almost certainly never have been found. The men formed a plan to march across the ice towards land. But after travelling just seven and a half miles (12km) in seven days, they gave up. “There was no alternative but to camp once more on the floe and to possess our souls with what patience we could till conditions should appear more favourable for a renewal of the attempt to escape,” wrote Shackleton. When the ice broke up the following April, the crew took to the lifeboats, rowing to Elephant Island, a remote and uninhabited outcrop. The men were exhausted, some afflicted by sea sickness, others convulsed with dysentery. “At least half the party were insane,” wrote Frank Wild, Shackleton’s second in command. But they made it. On 15 April they clambered ashore on Elephant Island. It was the first time the men had stood on solid ground in almost 500 days. After nine days of recuperation, Shackleton, Worsley and four others took one of the boats another 8oo miles (1,300km) across rough seas and in biting winds to South Georgia. “The boat tossed interminably on the big waves under grey, threatening skies. Every surge of the sea was an enemy to be watched and circumvented,” wrote Shackleton. It took 16 days to reach their destination. It was an extraordinary feat of survival, but their epic journey was not yet over. Three of the men, including Shackleton, then crossed South Georgia’s peaks and glaciers to reach a whaling station on the other side of the island. In August, after several failed attempts, a rescue party set out for Elephant Island, where the remaining 22 crewmen were waiting. In early 1922, Shackleton launched a new expedition to the Antarctic. On 5 January, while his ship was docked at South Georgia, he died of a heart attack, aged 47.",News/Science,Lost and found: the story of Shackleton’s Endurance epic,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/09/lost-and-found-story-of-shackleton-endurance-expedition
3/10/2022,"British American Tobacco will continue selling cigarettes in Russia, defying a gathering movement among global brands to halt operations there in response to the invasion of Ukraine. The London-based cigarette manufacturer, whose brands include Lucky Strike and Rothmans, said it would “continue to operate” in Russia, one of its key growth markets for cigarettes and heated tobacco, according to the company’s latest annual report. It will suspend capital investment and scale back marketing and business activities but stopped short of following its smaller British rival, Imperial Brands, by halting its operations altogether. Some of the world’s largest consumer goods companies, including Nestlé, Unilever, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and McDonald’s, have put Russian units on hold, prompting a warning from a senior Kremlin official that their operations could be nationalised. In a statement, British American Tobacco said its business in Ukraine had been suspended for safety reasons. “We are deeply concerned about the conflict in Ukraine. The safety and wellbeing of our people there and across the region is our first priority. We have full local establishments of 1,000 people in Ukraine and 2,500 in Russia. Our thoughts are with them all at this incredibly difficult time. “In Ukraine, we have suspended all business and manufacturing operations and are providing all the support and assistance we can to our colleagues, including relocation and temporary accommodation. Our businesses bordering Ukraine are providing assistance to the humanitarian relief effort.” But the tobacco company said it would not follow other companies’ lead by suspending its Russian business voluntarily and would instead abide by sanctions. “In Russia, we have a full establishment of our people right across the country, including substantial local manufacturing. Our business in Russia continues to operate. As a key principle we have a duty of care to all our employees at this extremely complicated and uncertain time for them and their families. “We have suspended all planned capital investment into Russia and will focus on our portfolio of locally produced tobacco products – including our heated tobacco products.

3/10/2022,"A landowner is facing legal action for what environmental regulators say is the decimation of a protected river. Natural England and the Environment Agency (EA) say the charges against the landowner include causing damage to a site of special scientific interest (SSSI), carrying out clearance and reprofiling of the riverbank which was likely to cause damage to or endanger the stability of the river and allowing silt to discharge into the river. The agencies investigated the actions at the River Lugg near Kingsland, Herefordshire, after complaints that clearance was taking place along the bank in December 2020. The agencies were alerted after reports of activities including dredging, illegal felling of trees and profiling of the riverbanks over nearly a mile (1.5km) of the river. The officials, along with the police, issued a stop notice to the landowner to halt the works, which the local wildlife trust said had devastated the river and would have dire consequences for wildlife and water quality. After a long investigation, the EA and Natural England said on Wednesday they had begun legal action. The charges also relate to further works which are alleged to have been carried out by the landowner in December 2021. Oliver Harmar, the chief operating officer at Natural England, said: “The decimation of this section of the River Lugg has been devastating to the local environment and to local people, destroying the habitats of iconic wildlife such as otters, kingfisher and salmon. It was heartbreaking to see this beautiful riverside illegally damaged.” The area is protected as an SSSI owing to its importance for nature. Consent is required before any works are carried out within an SSSI, which had not been granted, the agencies said.",News/Environment,Landowner facing legal action over ‘decimation’ of Herefordshire river,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/09/landowner-facing-legal-action-over-decimation-of-herefordshire-river
3/10/2022,"I had involvement with residential childcare for over 40 years, from the early 1960s until I retired. While your editorial (6 March) is correct, it highlights issues that have been around since I started. Regularly, improvements and revisions made in children’s homes are overturned as the next round of spending cuts arrives. From the passing of the Children Act in 1989 until the early 2000s, there was some progress. We now seem to be reversing many of the strides that have been made, taking money from young people looked after by the state to assist in cutting taxes for the more fortunate. You also highlight the scandals that have covered a range of issues from child abuse to financial abuse, all of which mean that children in care suffer more neglect rather than compensation for that which they have already suffered. This is often reflected in the behaviour of these young people, who then gain a negative public image which many politicians feel justifies not investing in them. Some young people cared for by the state may now receive little support beyond ages 15 or 16. It is not a system that needs tweaking or simply more money, but restructuring in such a way that reflects normal family care and support as much as possible, and then, as you say, tough regulation to ensure it is happening.Roy GrimwoodMarket Drayton, Shropshire  That most children’s homes are run by profit-seeking companies is scandalous. Numerous inquiries have highlighted the failures of our care system for children, and in 2015 David Cameron called for a “root and branch” review, but still there’s been no real improvement. Residential care continues to be an amateur service. If you appear to be reasonably caring and unlikely to abuse your charges, you can get a job. GPs have to complete at least four years of training, a solicitor six years, and the vet who treats your dog has a five-year qualification. Yet our most vulnerable children are cared for by people who are not required to have any previous relevant training. Kindness and common sense alone cannot address the distressing problems that children in homes exhibit. Few have a plan to treat the reasons they are in the home, and, if they do, it is unlikely to be fully implemented. Few even receive regular sessions with a qualified counsellor. The annual cost for one child averages up to £200,000, yet half of prisoners under the age of 25 have been in care. Figures for mental illness and homelessness are equally grim. Ownership and regulation of homes needs to be addressed, but will not solve their continuing failure to meet the needs of the children they exist to serve. I still await “root and branch” reform.Mel WoodSwords, County Dublin, Ireland  Yes, care standards must be raised, but the systemic failures of England’s care system are much deeper than just the role of private providers. The alarming example of Robert McGuinness (Report, 3 March) is one symptom of a care system in crisis. And it’s in crisis partly because of decades of underinvestment in children’s social care, which has enabled unacceptable levels of instability for children in and leaving care (7,230 children moved placement more than three times in 2021). The Independent Review of Children’s Social Care must tackle these root issues boldly in its incoming recommendations. And the government must commit to funding that enables the seismic change that’s desperately needed.Katharine Sacks-JonesCEO, Become  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/10/2022,"The dangerous and damaging myth of “political neutrality” in sport, long peddled by the likes of the International Olympic Committee and Fifa, has completely disintegrated in response to Russia’s barbarous, unprovoked and unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine. For too long, those in positions of power at the highest echelons of the global sporting ecosystem have cosied up to authoritarian regimes and brutal dictators, turned their heads away from the plight of fellow human beings as their rights have been withheld or curtailed, and allowed commercial interest to trump common interest. But this time sport has been forced to pick a side, and really mean it. Fuelled by overwhelming global public outrage and the uniting spirit of solidarity with the Ukrainian people, governing bodies, clubs, teams, sponsors and athletes have been asked to wield their power and influence to do whatever they can to bring about peace, draw attention to the need for safe routes for all those fleeing the conflict, and promote wider condemnation and ostracism of Putin’s regime. Sport’s only utility to wider society is when it lives true to its stated values – when it acts to make the world a better place and dares to speak up and speak out in support of the universal principles upon which it is based. Sport must never be allowed to peddle the lie that its strength lies in cowardly nods to “neutrality”. It doesn’t now; it never has; it never will. Its strength lies in its truly global influence, its uniting, cross-cultural spirit of togetherness, and its fiercely confident promotion of the very best of our shared values.Tim HarperExecutive director, Equitysport  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The phrase “parenthood pay gap” was also used on IWD by the shadow women and equalities secretary, Anneliese Dodds. This phrase is an example of the way in which de-sexing language can lead to an inaccurate picture. There is no “parenthood pay gap”. Social scientists have shown that motherhood plays a substantial role in the pay deficit that women suffer compared with men. Fatherhood, by contrast, has historically been associated with a wage premium. Reeves states that “the Labour party has always stood up for women”. But Labour politicians need to take note.

3/10/2022,"My mother, Kathleen Baker, who has died aged 87, had two careers – as a marriage guidance counsellor and then as a scriptwriter for three highly popular TV series, Crown Court, Brookside and Emmerdale, during the 1970s, 80s and 90s. Born in Oldham, she was the daughter of Jessie (nee Hilton), a nursing auxiliary, and Percy Potter, an engineer, and always held her northern roots close to her heart. She first went to Middleton grammar school in Oldham and then Luton girls’ high school in Bedfordshire, the family having moved to Luton when she was 12. In 1956 she gained a botany degree at St Hilda’s College, Oxford, and married Howard Baker, a stage manager with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Following my birth in Stratford-upon-Avon, in 1960 they settled in Sale, Manchester, where Roselyn, Vikki and our brother, Fenton, were born at home. Five years later they moved to a dilapidated and ramshackle house in Hale, Cheshire, and Olivia was born. It was the house in which Kathleen eventually died. She began training with the Marriage Guidance Council (now Relate), starting her work as a counsellor in 1975. Howard had a job with Granada TV, working on Coronation Street when it was first broadcast live, and in the late 70s Kathleen decided to get into television too. She first wrote scripts, credited under her maiden name, Kathleen Potter, for Crown Court (1978-84), continuing with her counselling work at the same time, and then moved full-time on to work on Brookside (1984-92), finally writing 20 episodes of Emmerdale (1994-95), after which she retired. She was chosen to represent the Marriage Guidance Council at the funeral of the Princess of Wales in 1997, and was appointed MBE in 2001 for her services to counselling. Following Howard’s death in 1993 and a difficult decade, Kathleen rekindled her friendship from their Oxford days with Michael Grindrod, who became her partner. In her later years she revelled in her garden, and she and Michael travelled widely.

3/10/2022,"A Medici family chapel created by Michelangelo that was cleaned with the help of bacteria has been presented to the public to mark the 545th anniversary of the Renaissance master’s birth. Michelangelo was commissioned to sculpt the New Sacristy, in the Medici chapels in San Lorenzo church in Florence, in 1520. Restorers struggled to clean the dirt and grime that accumulated over the centuries until resorting to an unconventional solution: bacteria. The tomb is adorned with sculptures representing likenesses of two dukes from the powerful Medici family, Giuliano di Lorenzo and Lorenzo di Piero, plus four allegorical figures representing different times of the day, and the Madonna and Child. A team spent eight years restoring the delicate monument, using a bacteria-infused gel during the final stage of the project to remove the most stubborn dirt marks. Scientists tested 11 strains of bacteria on marble before it was decided that three non-toxic varieties – Serratia ficaria SH7, Pseudomonas stutzeri CONC11 and Rhodococcus sp. ZONT – would be the most effective for Michelangelo’s masterpiece. Serratia ficaria, a bacterium that causes urinary tract infections, managed to remove dirt from the tomb in two days. Part of the sarcophagus was in a particularly bad state as the remains of Alessandro Medici, a ruler of Florence who was assassinated, had been buried in the tomb without being eviscerated, as was customary at the time for Medici family members. This meant that over time the organic liquids from the corpse had started to seep through and stain Michelangelo’s work. The restoration was completed last year and the cleaned-up tomb was presented to the public in an event hosted by the Academy of the Arts of Drawing. Monica Bietti, an art historian and former chief of the Medici chapels museum, who led the restoration project, said: “The restoration of one of the most symbolic places of art required knowledge, experience and science combined with the qualities of sensitivity and intelligence. For this reason, the work was tested from the start and then subjected to constant optical, methodological and scientific checks.”",News/World news,Florence tomb by Michelangelo restored with aid of bacteria,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/florence-tomb-by-michelangelo-restored-with-aid-of-bacteria
3/10/2022,"This has been quite the spell for those who like to number crunch around the world of professional golf. The Players Championship, taking place this weekend, carries a prize purse of $20m with $3.6m to be bestowed on the winner. By Sunday evening, three tournaments in a row played in Florida will have handed out a combined $40m on the basis of leaderboard placings. Arnold Palmer’s PGA Tour winnings totalled $1.9m. Those at the summit of this sport have never had it so good. Still, many believe the largesse associated with the PGA Tour in particular has become obscene, to the point where golfers will naturally lose all grip on reality. The theory was only endorsed as umpteen players at least flirted with Saudi Arabia and its bid for a breakaway tour. Phil Mickelson, without any apparent irony, blasted the PGA Tour for “obnoxious greed” before admitting his Saudi dealings were all about “leverage”. The Saudi scheme actually made little commercial sense – which perhaps doesn’t matter when you are seeking to rebrand a kingdom – but the willingness of sportsmen to indulge it on the basis of guaranteed tens of millions has been an inauspicious sight. The PGA and DP World Tours viewed the disruption plan as serious enough to not only close ranks but to beef up their financial offering. Yet again, the players win. But are golfers now paid too much? “We are paid as much as people are willing to pay us, I guess,” says Rory McIlroy. “You can say the same thing about footballers or any other athletes. You could argue that they’re paid too little or too much, but you’re only worth what people are willing to pay you. “I’d say at this point we’re fairly paid. The top guys earn a lot of money, and I think that’s right. Even the guys that are not at the top, they still earn a really, really good living. I think it’s a good structure.” McIlroy is one of many players who collect small fortunes via off-course endorsements and private business interests. Palmer did likewise. Although a conflicting viewpoint is not publicly available – do not bite the hand etc – it does exist. Aaron Rodgers denied a report that he has agreed a four-year contract worth $200m in the NFL but the figure was easy to believe. In the context of golf, Tiger Woods has earned slightly more than $120m across his career from the PGA Tour, $25m more than Mickelson. McIlroy’s PGA Tour career winnings are $60m. Golfers do genuinely look at the guaranteed salaries of US team sports stars and wonder if their deal is a poor one. The difference, of course, lies in exposure: Woods would be recognised in any city, which cannot legitimately be said about most golfers in the world’s top 20. “When I turned pro, if you turned to me and said you’d give me all my expenses and pay my mortgage plus the average wage on top of that, I would have had a great life,” says Pádraig Harrington. “It has changed so much but we don’t have control of that. A lot of the Irish professionals before me had to get jobs when they finished on tour. “A lot of it is relative. Winning £1,000 in the 1960s could buy you a house. Winning $2m won’t get you much in Florida. I don’t begrudge the guys who have the prize money going up. Careers don’t last long. There is not a simple answer to the question; there is no way you can say we don’t get paid too much but that’s what the market dictates. At the very top it looks astronomical but look at football.” Harrington rightly points out that the costs associated with playing a full schedule in Europe means one may not need to go particularly far down the DP World Tour’s money list to find players who aren’t enjoying a lavish lifestyle. It is fitting, of course, that Woods will be inducted into golf’s Hall of Fame in a week where the sport’s class of 2022 scrap over a record prize fund at Sawgrass. Largely through increased television interest, Woods single-handedly drove up his sport’s value. “He made professional golf at the highest level a very, very attractive thing to be involved in,” says McIlroy. “TV paid more. Sponsors paid more. And then all of a sudden, his peers and colleagues and other players were getting paid more because of that. I think we all have to be very thankful for Tiger Woods.”",Sport/Sport,Most lucrative Players Championship yet highlights growth of golf’s riches,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/09/most-lucrative-players-championship-yet-highlights-growth-of-golfs-riches
3/10/2022,"Maria Friedman has staged several solo cabaret shows but this one, dedicated to Stephen Sondheim, Marvin Hamlisch and Michel Legrand, is a collaborative affair, with several parts and many singers. Bouncing on stage, a glamorous fizz of energy, Friedman kicks off her silver stilettos and pads around in stockinged feet, inhabiting every song. Her voice is crystalline, quivering, silky, deep or high, as the song requires it; it is filled with all the hope and youth of a wannabe in Broadway Baby and driven by mournful knowing in Losing My Mind. She sounds all the more glorious in this intimate space, the stage lit up by bulbs that give it the look of a theatrical jazz club (lighting design by Paul Pyant, with superb musical accompaniment by pianist Theo Jamieson, double bassist Paul Moylan and drummer Joe Evans). Under the direction of David Babani, this is a show that oozes love for performance. The big dramatic moments that come through the songs are sometimes accompanied by cute vignettes about Friedman’s friendships, and working relationships, with the three composers. But the bigger conceit of this show is to not merely look back but find a future for their legacies. So there is a choir from the Royal Academy of Music and two prominent young singers plucked out: the ebullient Indonesian-born Desmonda Cathabel and 19-year-old Alfie Friedman. His status as Maria’s son slightly undercuts the sense of democratic discovery being showcased on stage, although it does not take away from his astonishing talent – his singing is one of the biggest highlights. There are solos and group numbers, the latter coming together gorgeously in Hamlisch’s I Hope I Get It and in Legrand’s The Windmills of Your Mind. But the various elements make for a mixed bag of a show: partly a look back to three extraordinary legacies, with Sondheim at the centre, and also something of a “Maria Friedman show”, with stories about her life, family, struggles and career highs. This is charming but sometimes cheesy in its self-celebratory tone: we are told about the time she was called up by Hamlisch who was struck by hearing her voice on the radio, with Hamlisch’s widow, Terre, appearing on stage to retell the story. Friedman sits with singers Ian McLarnon and Matthew White, who perform throughout the show, and speaks of how they met, had kids, and came back together again. It is all forgivably self-indulgent but draws the evening into becoming a long, slightly flabby affair. It is clear that Friedman has an indefatigable passion for song. She will go on performing until she drops, she says, and there is, in the numerous finales at the end, a sense that she could simply go on telling stories and entertaining us, in an all-night cabaret lock-in, given half the chance.

3/10/2022,"What were they really like? In a biography of an artist, answering that question can be either an overt mission or a rumbling subtext. The Andy Warhol Diaries (Netflix), Andrew Rossi’s exhaustive six-parter based on Warhol’s own journal, chooses the former to an occasionally startling degree, but the work has already been chewed up and spat out a million times. Here is a long look at why a fallible human made it. The show is based on Warhol’s own words, spoken to and transcribed by his friend Pat Hackett on a daily basis between 1976 and Warhol’s death in 1987, then published as a 1,200-page brick of intrigue in 1989. Episode one begins with an instruction to us not to take Warhol’s version of events on trust, which the programme precludes in any case via its rounded roster of contributors: as well as Warhol museum curators, other artists and simpatico cultural figures like Jerry Hall and John Waters, we hear from Warhol’s professional confidants and the loved ones of those closest to him. A man who strove to be unknowable becomes, partly by his own hand but mainly via the observations of others, known.The picture constructed is an intensified version of an old story: that of the artist as an interested alien, a spectator who envies the players while better understanding the game. Andrew Warhola, the son of Austro-Hungarian immigrants from a poor part of conservative Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, relocates to New York and reinvents himself as both the boss of the Factory, a queer sanctuary at the avant garde end of the 1960s Manhattan art scene, and a wildly popular interpreter of commerce and celebrity’s vulgar iconographies. He is an outsider who craves mainstream acceptance, but whose art relies on standing outside it to see it clearly; a god of the underground art world whose obsession with the surfaces of celebrity puts him at constant risk of being dismissed as superficial.The central point made by The Andy Warhol Diaries is the extent to which these tensions are created by Warhol’s sexuality, religion and self-image. As a gay Catholic who hates his own hair, skin and features – “I’m just a freak. I can’t change it. I’m too unusual” – he is revealed here as brittle and insecure in a personal life defined by three key relationships: the series gives over a whole episode each to Warhol’s lovers, Jed Johnson and Jon Gould, and to his friend and collaborator Jean-Michel Basquiat.The Johnson story is the most rewarding, beginning in 1967 when he delivers a package to the building that is about to become the second iteration of the Factory and, deemed too handsome to work as a courier, is hired on the spot. His subsequent relationship with Warhol lasts for 12 years and has the classic contours of a doomed love between a volatile creative and the gentle companion who grounds them: as Warhol questions his own relevance in the 70s, Johnson flourishes as an interior designer with an eye for elegant luxury and access to famous clients. Eventually Johnson leaves his famous partner when Warhol’s interest in hardcore sex films and Studio 54 excess become unbearable. Warhol almost immediately transfers his affection to Gould, a strapping, preppy, sweater-round-the-neck movie executive whose posh New England background and ability to pass for straight make him an avatar for many of the things Warhol craves. Clearly Gould’s importance to Warhol runs deeper than this and their love is real, but the contributor who can offer intimate insights about the relationship and its influence on Warhol’s work apparently does not exist. At this point, the show’s long running time and diligent treatment of the men in Warhol’s life as subjects in their own right start to feel indulgent.There’s no such problem with the instalment on Basquiat, the emerging genius whose joint canvases with Warhol revitalise the older man’s creativity in the early 80s. Their flirty symbiosis, where who’s piggybacking on whose reputation – if indeed anyone is – remains disputed, raises hard questions about whether Warhol’s affinity with people of colour, both as fellow artists and subjects of his work, veers into exploitation. But the appreciation of their joint art is thrilling, bolstered by archive footage that is dreamily evocative of a century that feels inescapably more decadent, glamorous and ripe with potential than our own. The last episode delivers an illuminating, heartfelt reappraisal of Warhol’s maligned final paintings, seeing them as his response to the Aids epidemic. Having lost Gould to Aids, Warhol is painfully invested in the calamity, not at all the disinterested voyeur suggested by his public facade. That was a false impression all along: this series shows that for Warhol, it was always personal.",Arts/Television & radio,The Andy Warhol Diaries review – a startling biopic told with the artist’s own words,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/09/the-andy-warhol-diaries-review-a-startling-biopic-told-with-the-artists-own-words
3/10/2022,"Households are facing the prospect of even higher food prices owing to the war in Ukraine, threatening hikes of the kind seen in 2008 after the global financial crisis, as wheat exports from Ukraine and Russia come under threat, compounding price increases resulting from the climate crisis. Prices of wheat, maize and soya beans have surpassed 2008 levels in recent days, with maize hovering slightly below prices of 2013 and soya beans reaching similar heights as in 2012. Arif Husain, the chief economist at the UN World Food Programme (WFP), said: “The devastating consequences of the Russian onslaught on Ukraine are also felt in places far away. Grain and oil prices are fast approaching or even surpassing levels not seen since the 2008 food and fuel crisis.” Food prices were surging around the world before the invasion, in part because of the effects of the climate crisis and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), a UN agency, has said Ukrainian farmers could miss the crucial May planting season for their crops. Supplies from Russia could also come under threat if the Kremlin curtails wheat exports in response to western sanctions. Ukraine is the fifth largest wheat exporter, accounting for about 10% of the global market, according to the FAO. It is also one of the biggest exporters of maize, accounting for about 15% of global exports. Russia is the world’s largest wheat exporter, with about 17% share of the global export market, and is the second biggest supplier of sunflower seed. The Black Sea region exports at least 12% of global food calories, including sunflower oil, maize and other crops along with wheat. A large proportion of these exports – about 40% in the case of wheat – go to the Middle East and Africa, where food price rises are already biting. Gilbert Houngbo, the president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, said: “We are very concerned that an extended conflict in Ukraine could limit the world’s supply of staple crops like wheat, corn and sunflower oil, resulting in the skyrocketing of food prices and hunger. This could jeopardise global food security and heighten geopolitical tensions. “The continuation of this conflict, already a tragedy for those directly involved, will be catastrophic for the entire world, and particularly those that are already struggling to feed their families.” One in 10 people in the world already lack enough food to eat, and coronavirus has exacerbated the problem as pandemic has disrupted markets and food transportation networks in developing countries, as well as worsening poverty. What makes this crisis even worse is that the effects of climate breakdown have already created global disruption in key food markets. Prices for durum wheat, used to make pasta, soared by 90% late last year after widespread drought and record heatwaves in Canada, one of the world’s biggest grain producers. Key growing areas in the US experienced wildfires and extreme weather last year, while there was drought in areas of Latin America. Australia is suffering from devastating floods, the impacts of which have yet to be fully felt on its agricultural exports. This it on top of problems with poor weather last year. In the UK, food prices have been affected by Brexit, which has increased costs because of the extra bureaucracy involved in shipping. In some of the world’s most vulnerable regions, people were already facing acute food shortages owing to weather conditions of the type that have been found to be worsening as a result of the climate crisis. Drought is already afflicting the Horn of Africa, threatening famine there. Three consecutive failed rainy seasons have decimated crops and caused abnormally high livestock deaths. Shortages of water and pasture are forcing families from their homes and leading to increased conflict between communities. Forecasts suggest the below-average rainfall will worsen, compounding already dire conditions in the coming months. Michael Dunford, the WFP’s regional director for eastern Africa, said: “Harvests are ruined, livestock are dying, and hunger is growing as recurrent droughts affect the Horn of Africa. The situation requires immediate humanitarian action and consistent support to build the resilience of communities for the future.”",News/Global development,Ukraine war piles pressure on global food system already in crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/mar/09/ukraine-war-piles-pressure-on-global-food-system-already-in-crisis
3/10/2022,"Venezuela has released two jailed Americans as the two countries seek to improve relations amid an energy crisis caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Gustavo Cárdenas, an executive with US oil refining company Citgo was released on Tuesday night, along with Jorge Fernández, who was arrested last year on terrorism charges the White House described as “spurious”. “These men are fathers who lost precious time with their children and everyone they love, and their families have suffered every day of their absence,” Joe Biden said in a statement. Despite boasting the world’s largest proven oil reserves, Venezuela is mired in political, economic and social crises, with shortages in food and fuel widespread. President Nicolás Maduro has brutally clamped down on dissent, arresting and torturing protesters and perceived enemies, and has been accused of rigging a string of elections. The US broke diplomatic ties with Maduro’s government in 2019, recognising the opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the South American country’s legitimate president, while levelling sanctions on Venezuela and its state-controlled oil sector. But over the weekend White House representatives visited Caracas for talks – the first trip of its kind in over 20 years – in an apparent attempt to pull Venezuela away from Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. The release of the two Americans on Tuesday night came hours after Maduro appeared to indicate interest in improving relations with the US, hinting that he was willing to resume negotiations with the opposition. Cárdenas, along with five other Citgo executives – known as the Citgo Six – had been detained since 2017, after being lured to Caracas for a meeting at the offices of PDVSA, Venezuela’s state owned oil company of which Citgo is a subsidiary. The other five remain detained. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, confirmed that Cárdenas and Fernández were back in the US. Observers say that the energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has led both the White House and Maduro to cautiously pursue a better relationship. “Yesterday’s release is welcome news, as is the decision by the Biden administration to engage directly with President Maduro, despite having no formal diplomatic relations for the past three years,” said Phil Gunson, a Venezuela analyst at the International Crisis Group, a thinktank. “It is clear that the trigger for this renewed engagement is the energy crisis faced by the US and its allies, now driven primarily by the war in Ukraine and the move to ban imports of Russian oil and gas. “As Washington seeks a deal with Maduro involving sanctions relief in exchange for alleviating the oil shock,” Gunson went on to say, “it will rightly be under pressure not to leave out of the equation the need for progress in restoring institutional rule in Venezuela and resolving the political and humanitarian crisis.”",News/World news,Venezuela releases two Americans in effort to improve relations amid energy crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/venezuela-releases-two-americans-energy-crisis
3/10/2022,"The Catholic church has banned a visit to a London school by a gay author and removed a number of governors who supported the event, in a move that has drawn comparisons to the notorious 1980s section 28 ban on “promoting homosexuality”. The church said a visit by Simon James Green, an acclaimed author of books for children and young adults, fell “outside the scope of what is permissible in a Catholic school”. Green had been due to speak and sign books on Monday at John Fisher boys’ school in Purley, south London, a voluntary-aided faith school overseen by the Catholic archdiocese of Southwark. A second event at another school, St John’s primary in Gravesend, scheduled for Wednesday, was also cancelled. Green told the Guardian that he “didn’t think this sort of thing could happen in the UK today. I was at school when section 28 was in force. So I know full well the horror of living under that legislation. But it was repealed in 2003. So I didn’t think a school today would go down that route.” Section 28, which prohibited local authorities from “promoting homosexuality”, was introduced by Margaret Thatcher’s government in response to a children’s book, Jenny Lives With Eric and Martin, depicting different kinds of families. In a statement issued a few days before the John Fisher event, the archdiocese said its schools were required to “deliver a programme of relationships and sex education that is compliant with the Equalities Act 2010 and Magisterium [teaching] of the Catholic church”. It added: “From time to time, materials or events emerge for consideration that fall outside the scope of what is permissible in a Catholic school … In such circumstances, we have no alternative but to affirm our unequivocal and well-known theological and moral precepts and to act in accordance with them.” However, the school’s leadership team, backed by its governors, voted to go ahead with Green’s visit. The archdiocese then cancelled the event and removed a number of governors. The school’s chaplain, Father James Clark, emailed parents to say the proposed event had “caused scandal in the local area and has brought our international reputation into doubt”. The email, seen by the Guardian, added: “The headteacher and some governors have decided to disobey the clear instruction from the diocese and this will have serious consequences in the weeks ahead,” and saying that the school “had no choice but to make a stand against tyranny and to defend truth”. Catholic Truth, a Catholic website, also campaigned against the event, saying: “Catholic schools cannot, under any circumstance, endanger the faith of pupils in their charge by presenting as a good, something which is condemned by the divinely bequeathed teaching authority of Christ’s church.” One parent told the Guardian: “A lot of us are shocked at the intolerant language being used. It sends a terrible message to the children. Who would want to come and teach here or send their children here after this?” The NEU and NASUWT teaching unions at the school passed a motion saying they believed the archdiocese’s decision violated the UN convention on the rights of the child. Members were “concerned about the mental and emotional impact these events have had on our LGBTQ+ community and wider inclusive John Fisher school family, including staff, students and parents”. A spokesperson for the NEU said the cancellation of the event and the decision to remove some school governors was “a matter of grave concern”. The union would be writing to the archdiocese “calling for the reinstatement of both the governing body members and for the visit by Simon James Green to be allowed to go ahead”. Green said his response to the church’s actions was disbelief. “There was initial shock and dismay and hurt, but after that it was the students I felt most worried for. I know what it’s like to be a teenager at school, questioning yourself, and how vulnerable that can make you.” His books for young adults were novels featuring LGBT characters, with some “soft romance” but nothing explicit, he said. His books for younger readers celebrated underdogs but contained nothing about LGBT issues. Green said he hoped the school events could be rescheduled. He decided to speak out “because if you don’t, there can be creeping sense of people feeling emboldened in the future, and things getting worse”. Stephen Evans of the National Secular Society said: “The disturbing behaviour of this diocese highlights a broader problem of faith schools stigmatising same-sex relationships and therefore contributing to a climate where many young LGBT people are growing up feeling ashamed or frightened about who they are. “Our own research has shown that a significant number of faith schools promote the idea that same-sex attraction is ‘morally wrong’, ‘disordered’ or a ‘lifestyle choice’. This isn’t acceptable in a publicly funded school.” Robert Cann of Humanists UK said the archdiocese was “discriminating against a well-regarded children’s author, whose work has been celebrated far and wide, simply because his work promotes LGBT acceptance. The result is that children, including LGBT children, are missing out on learning that LGBT people should be celebrated, and their relationships should be respected just like those of straight people. “Dioceses should not have the power to block lessons that promote inclusion under the Equality Act, and they should not be able to sack governors who support such lessons.” A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “We are looking into the circumstances surrounding the diocese’s role in this incident … Schools should teach students that everybody has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, with particular regard to their duties under the Equality Act.” The archdiocese of Southwark and John Fisher school have been contacted for comment.",Arts/Books,Catholic church bans visit by gay author to London school,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/09/catholic-church-bans-visit-by-gay-author-to-london-school

3/10/2022,"A nightclub infamous for its sticky carpet has sold dozens of souvenir chunks of the fabric after a joke suggestion became a reality. The Acapulco has been a fixture of Halifax nightlife for decades and thousands of clubgoers have become attached to its garishly patterned carpet. The club, which claims to be the oldest in Britain, opened in 1961 and laid the colourful floor covering – which quickly become a local fixture itself – in 2003. Simon Jackson, the owner of the “the Acca” as it is widely known in West Yorkshire, said his carpet had been unfairly maligned but insisted its reputation could be used for good. The idea to sell it off started as a “tongue-in-cheek joke” between friends but quickly “snowballed” as word got out, he said. Within an hour on Wednesday afternoon, the club had sold more than 100 pieces of its carpet. “It’s gone really, really mental,” said Jackson. “We thought we would be chucking most of it but we’ve had to pull some bits out of the skip, if I’m honest. It’s going great guns.” For only £5, customers can own an A4-sized slice of the 19-year-old fabric. Big spenders can take home a framed and engraved piece for £50. Buyers can even order a piece of carpet from a specific place in the club, including outside the toilet, below the bar or the well-worn fray at the edge of the dancefloor. Proceeds from the sale will go to the local Street Angels charity, which carries out night-time patrols in Halifax to check on the welfare of drinkers. Jackson, 55, said he had been inundated with emails from patrons who have a special connection to a specific part of the Acca. One person got in touch to say they had scattered their grandmother’s ashes in the club, he said, while others have pointed to the exact spot where they first met their partner. “It’s got some history there,” he said. “It is the oldest club in the country and it’s probably the oldest carpet in the country. The carpet is probably older than some of our customers.” The Acca has enjoyed a loyal fanbase in West Yorkshire for decades, remaining popular when competition from superclubs, festivals and cheap foreign holidays have seen hundreds of other nightclubs go to the wall. While many are no doubt drawn to its special offers – 75p drinks before 11pm and free entry for the first 200 revellers – its popularity is also due to its place in local history. Jackson, who first worked at the club in the 1980s and became its owner in 1995, said he hoped the carpet sale would raise £3,000 for charity and put a spring in people’s step: “I suppose with the rest of the news going on it will just make people smile.”",News/Business,Infamous sticky carpet sold off in chunks as nightclub has a revamp ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/09/halifax-acapulco-nightclub-sells-famous-carpet-charity

3/10/2022,"A newly discovered fossilized vampire squid has been named after the US president, Joe Biden, a team of paleontologists has announced. The Syllipsimopodi bideni, which has been described as an “incredibly rare” fossil, was first dug up in Montana and then donated to the Royal Museum in Canada in 1988. But it sat untouched in a drawer for decades until a scientist pulled it out for a closer look. Speaking to the New York Times, Christopher Whalen, a paleontologist from New York’s American Museum of Natural History, said he first noticed the squid’s preserved arms and saw small suckers in the rock. “This was sitting in a museum since the 80s and no one realized it was important,” said Whalen. “We chanced on that importance because I happened to notice the arm suckers.” The Syllipsimopodi bideni drifted across oceans nearly 328m years ago. According to Whalen, it is the oldest known ancestor of vampyropods, a group that includes vampire squids and octopuses. The fossil’s first name translates roughly to “prehensile foot”, since it has 10 arms and is the oldest known cephalopod to have suckers on each of its arms. Modern vampire squids, which are not squids but close relatives to the octopus, have eight arms and two stringy filaments. According to the paper, the fossil even appeared to contain a preserved ink sac. Whalen, along with Neil Landman, a curator emeritus at the American Museum of Natural History, described the new species in the journal Nature Communications on Tuesday. Their decision to name the squid after Biden came as they were “encouraged by his plans to address climate change and to fund scientific research”, Whalen said in an email to the New York Times. The Syllipsimopodi bideni is not the first species to be named after a president. Nine species were named after Barack Obama, including a spider, a hairworm and several fish. A moth and a blind worm-like amphibian that buries its head in the sand were named after Donald Trump.",News/Science,Joe Biden is a fossil: 328m-year-old vampire squid named after president,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/09/joe-biden-fossil-name-vampire-squid
3/10/2022,"Iarrived on the same day as Maria. She was shy, withdrawn and reminded me of a fragile bird as she leaned over her hot drink to keep warm. We would talk in the garden, the only place to find any peace, and fantasise about eating lasagne and drinking red wine. We were in prison. I was on remand awaiting trial. I had been arrested while suffering a psychotic episode – I would be there for six months until the hospital order arrived from the court. It felt like six years. Everyone had a sad story: domestic abuse, childhood trauma, homelessness. One woman, after losing her son, set herself on fire. Another, also charged with arson, set her house on fire during a psychotic episode. One had attempted suicide with her child in tow. I felt like the odd one out. I had a wonderful childhood; I hadn’t experienced anything traumatic and had never been homeless. But there is no stereotypical prisoner – you can end up in prison regardless of your background. What I did share with the others was that I was severely mentally unwell. I was on the mental health wing, but there are plenty of ill people on the main wings of prisons too. A recent report from the Centre of Mental Health commissioned by NHS England found that 45% of adults in prison have anxiety or depression, 8% have a diagnosis of psychosis, and 60% have experienced a traumatic brain injury. Is prison really the best place for people who are mentally unwell? It is difficult to capture just how claustrophobic a prison cell is. “Lock-up!” an officer would bellow, and we would all rush to our cells. There it was just me, my thoughts and four walls. It was impossible to sleep, with the screaming and shouting of other prisoners. Sometimes, when there were staff shortages, we were locked up for 24 hours a day. I have no doubt that the dehumanising nature of being locked away for most of the day made my mental illness – later diagnosed as bipolar disorder – worse in every possible way. I saw a psychiatrist who started me on anti-psychotic medication, but the delusions that had landed me in prison for arson in the first place grew stronger. I never turned on the television in my cell because my illness made me think the newsreaders were speaking to me. I was too scared to eat anything in case someone had drugged my food. It is easy to fall into despair in such a situation. I felt suicidal. Two girls on my wing tried to kill themselves while I was there. They were found by staff in time, but many others are not. In the 12 months to March 2021, there were 79 suicides in prisons in the UK. The report by the Centre of Mental Health, which used research from the Offender Health Research Network, states that of the 285 self-inflicted deaths occurring in English and Welsh prisons between 2016-2018, 63% of victims had a mental health diagnosis recorded, and 67% had their reception screening carried out by a nurse without mental health qualifications. Self-harm was rife. My mood grew so low that I self-harmed for the first time. According to government data, there were 55,542 self-harm incidents in prisons in the 12 months to December 2020, with rates especially high among women prisoners. The only thing that made me feel any better was reading. I would read and reread Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl, highlighting the words “he who has a why to live for can bear almost any how”. Whether it was Frankl, Donna Tartt or Ian McEwan, books transported me away from my surroundings for a short while. One of the prison officers would bring me books, and chatted to me when I was feeling down. When he was on shift, my mood lifted. When I found out that the only way to get out of your cell during the day was to work, I did all I could to get a job in the prison library. Prisoners feel worthless and hopeless, with little to provide comfort and intellectual stimulation. Books fill this gap. Some prisoners would come in for a crime series, or looked for prison diaries – perhaps to find out how others had survived. Others would lose themselves in a fantasy series such as Harry Potter or Twilight. I remember one prisoner animatedly telling me about all the different books she had read while in prison. She was extremely well-read, and I presumed she had brought this love of reading from her life outside. In fact, she had never read a single book before entering prison. This is common. Almost one third of adult prisoners assessed by the Ministry of Justice are below the reading level expected of an 11-year-old. According to the Shannon Trust, which helps rehabilitate prisoners by using inmates who can read to teach those who can’t, 50% of UK prisoners are functionally illiterate. Of the women remanded by magistrates in the UK in 2019, 60% did not ultimately receive a custodial sentence. According to the Centre of Mental Health, this can often do more harm than good as coming to prison, especially on a short sentence, as I did, creates a huge disruption to the life of people who are already extremely vulnerable and unwell. Being on remand is not the answer to an acute episode of mental illness. It is inhumane and impractical to lock someone up who is floridly psychotic; the solutions lie in a better-resourced mental health system that treats the unwell person rather than locking them away. Out of sight, the problem is still there: an acutely unwell individual in need of the right treatment and support. Maria and I are both out now. I hope she is eating lasagne and drinking red wine. I hope she is free. I hope all the prisoners I met are now receiving the support they need instead of being locked in a cell surrounded by others who also don’t deserve to be there. I hope.

3/10/2022,"Scientific evidence of sharks sleeping has been documented in Australia for the first time. A team of scientists has observed sleep in draughtsboard sharks, a bottom-dwelling species endemic to Australia, by analysing the animals’ metabolism and posture. The study’s lead author, Dr Michael Kelly of La Trobe University, said there was previously anecdotal evidence of sleep in sharks, mostly from observations by scuba divers. “From a scientific standpoint, quantitatively, this had never been looked at,” he said. The team monitored seven draughtsboard sharks over a 24-hour period, and found that the sharks’ metabolism – as measured through oxygen consumption – dropped during periods of inactivity longer than five minutes. “We know that a drop in metabolism is a telltale sign of sleep in many, many other animals,” Kelly said. When the sharks were inactive for five minutes or longer, the animals’ metabolic rates dropped lower than when they were when awake but resting, or actively swimming. In addition, the animals also changed their body posture to lying flat while sleeping. Draughtsboard sharks are ambush predators. When awake but inactive, the sharks stick out their pectoral fins and sit with their heads up, Kelly said. The sharks sometimes slept with their eyes shut, but the researchers noted this happened more often during the day. They surmise the shut-eye was associated with light levels rather than sleep. Kelly’s previous work has investigated behavioural indicators of sleep in the sharks, such as a rousing threshold. “When these animals are inactive for five minutes or longer, it takes a higher amount of stimulation to elicit a reaction from them,” he said. Behavioural indicators of sleep are not considered definitive, as it’s difficult for researchers to tell whether an animal is truly asleep or merely playing dead or in quiet wakefulness. Draughtsboard sharks are a species of buccal pumping sharks, which manually push water over their gills so they can respire even while still. Obligate ram ventilators, on the other hand – which includes great whites and tiger sharks – must keep swimming to ventilate their gills, and die from a lack of oxygen if they stop. “The idea was … those animals aren’t sleeping because they move continuously,” Kelly said, adding the theory had been debunked in other animals. “Staying still is not a criteria for sleep. We see that in marine mammals – whales and dolphins are able to keep swimming and sleep … We know that birds are able to keep flying and sleep.” Kelly plans to monitor brain activity in draughtsboard sharks, and says further research on sleep in ram ventilators is needed.

3/10/2022,"Thousands of victims of the floods in NSW and Queensland will be unable to claim on their insurance due to exclusions in policy fine print, the Financial Rights Law Centre says. What is covered by insurance policies varies wildly between insurers because definitions of events including flood, rainwater runoff and wind damage are not standard, the group said in a new report. “There are going to be a lot of people who think they’re covered,” Drew MacRae, a policy officer at FLRC, said. But many will find they are not covered because the fine print excludes particular types of damage, MacRae said. He said this even applied to flood damage, which was given a standard definition after floods in Queensland in 2011, when the Brisbane River broke its banks and inundated low-lying Brisbane suburbs as well as regional centres. One insurer, NRMA, has included rainwater runoff in its definition of flooding, the FLRC report said. Residents “may have opted out of flood but have coverage for storm or rain,” MacRae said. “But if you couldn’t afford flood insurance, you may not be covered for rainwater runoff,” he said. In its report, Standardising General Insurance Definitions, FLRC found 65% of the insurers it examined considered flood and storm to be separate events but the rest lumped them in together. Some insurers also included wind, hail, rain and cyclone under the definition of storm but others did not. One insurer, RACV, also allows itself to remove flooding, rainwater runoff and storm surge damage from a policy if it deems a property at risk of these events, FLRC said. The research found that more than 75% of policies excluded damage to retaining walls, 25% excluded damage to bridges and 62% excluded damage to driveways or gravel paths. The majority of insurers (62%) excluded damage from “actions of the sea”, such as tidal surges, with only one, Defence, explicitly including it in their policies. Three insurers – NRMA, RACV and SGIC – said they would only pay for soil movement damage if it happened immediately as a result of the storm or rainwater runoff. The Insurance Council of Australia said 107,844 claims have been lodged over the floods in NSW and south-east Queensland, estimated to be worth $1.62bn. MacRae said the lack of standardisation also affected fire policies – something people discovered after the 2019-2020 bushfires ripped through large swathes of eastern Victoria and southern NSW. “In the black summer, some people were covered and some were not,” he said. “It comes down to whether it was fire with a flame, was it a bushfire? Sometimes they don’t cover smoke damage, sometimes they don’t cover heat damage.” He said terms needed standardising so that policyholders could use the new Consumer Data Right (CDR), which allows consumers to share their data with providers. “The CDR is there to help people switch, to get better deals,” he said. “The lack of standardisation makes it very difficult to do that.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He said the problem had been obvious for years. “The industry will say we need innovation and competition but what is the point of innovation that means people aren’t covered for basics? “It really is another way of reducing costs.” The government committed to standardising insurance on the recommendation of a Senate inquiry in 2017 and began a consultation process in 2018. But progress stalled because treasury was focused on the banking royal commission, which kicked off in 2018, and its recommendations, which commissioner Kenneth Hayne handed to government in February 2019. “They still have not gone back to the work of standardising the definitions,” MacRae said.",News/Australia news,"Insurance fine print may mean thousands of flood victims are unable to claim, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/10/insurance-fine-print-may-mean-thousands-of-flood-victims-are-unable-to-claim-report-says
3/10/2022,"An earthquake hit Melbourne, The Taliban took Kabul and the Demons won their first grand final in 57 years. All that was immaterial, of course. The countdown to trade period was on in earnest, and the boys at Trade Radio were already pulling 18-hour shifts. Day or night, you could tune in and hear a variation of the following conversation - “I wouldn’t say he’s elite…but I wouldn’t say he isn’t elite either.” “He has huge upside SOS.” “Oh massive upside, Damo.” “500k is unders, don’t you think Lordo? “Definitely overs for me Kaneo.” In Show Me the Money, a three-part documentary that premieres on Stan on Thursday night, the trade period, the draft, the deals and the horse trading are examined in considerable detail. Craig Hutchison, the man behind Trade Radio, calls the period footy’s equivalent of The Shawshank Redemption. Indeed, for some of us, it’s akin to six weeks bunked down with Bogs Diamond. But it’s increasingly popular. It rates its socks off. Every October, otherwise functioning adults will bail you up with seven-way trade scenarios – complete with diagrams, arrows, and six players you’ve never heard of. Ultimately, it’s less about selling hope, and more about providing content. Despite the title of this documentary, money is almost never mentioned. Instead it’s all about picks, swaps, poker faces and hedged bets. It’s about player managers, who often carry themselves like real estate agents. When they’re not on the golf course, they’re on the driving range. They’re a study of how many intonations of the word “mate” you can squeeze into a single sentence. To their credit, they generally have their players’ – sorry, their clients’ – best interests at heart. So many of the players are dealing with very real and very normal problems – a homesick partner, a new baby, a boss that hates them. Their manager is there to help, to cut a deal, to facilitate a new start. In many ways, the players are peripheral. They’re names on a whiteboard. They’re bargaining chips. They’re shopped around for chickenfeed. They’re swapped for a “future third”. While Rory Lobb and Jeremy Finlayson’s sporting careers are being decided, they’re out fishing. When Bobby Hill’s dreams of returning to Melbourne are scuppered at the last minute, he’s in the tattooist’s chair. We meet Luke Dunstan, who’s fallen out of favour with his coach, and out of love with the game. “Clubs aren’t willing to give up collateral,” his manager tells him. “It’s shit for you guys – it’s not really player friendly. Unfortunately, it’s just the way the system works, mate.” They discuss his options. Gold Coast seem vaguely keen. He could get some work as a carpenter. Out of nowhere, the reigning premiers snap him up. So much of the language emanating from football clubs these days is about the communal – about connection, about playing your role, about leaving your ego on the hook. But in reality, especially during trade period, it’s every man for himself. It’s George Costanza when the fire alarm goes off. The young draftees are a bit less jaded. They’re “full of upside”, “first round locks”, “contested ball beasts” and “young men of outstanding character”. They’re all “pretty excited to get stuck into it”. When they make their debut, there’ll be the obligatory social media video - neatly packaged and suitably soppy. Some of them will be set up for life. But many won’t make it. Many careers will fizzle out. They’ll have “little currency”. They’ll be shunted from club to club. They’ll have that youthful vim sucked out of them. They may be left to rot on the Gold Coast, or out at Casey Fields. The coach might hate them. Their brains might be mush by 25. They might not actually be that good. They’ll be farewelled with a two-sentence press release. Even if you’re the top pick, there are no guarantees. From the moment he was drafted, Tom Boyd hated football and all its associated bullshit. Jon Patton had three knee reconstructions, left Hawthorn amid complaints that saw him apologise for his inappropriate behaviour towards women, and is now selling real estate on the Gold Coast. Paddy McCartin suffered concussion after concussion, had to re-train his neural pathways and only recently was offered a lifeline on Sydney’s rookie list. The draftees in Show Me the Money are so knowing, so polished. But they’re just boys. They’re the Covid generation of draftees. They’re the unraced colt who hasn’t been seen at the trials. One sobs when his number isn’t called out, and his good mate is snapped up. One is flanked by his grandparents. As each club bypasses him, he slumps a little further in his seat. For Jason Horne-Francis, there are no such indignities. He has a pet turtle, a teenage moustache, a manager who once won Big Brother and a highlights reel that can make your brain yelp. He also has one of those footy heads – a calm, assessing, distant look that suggests not a scintilla of self-doubt. Luke Hodge had it. Joel Selwood still has it. Writing about both of them in The Age, Tim Boyle noticed “a glimpse of the wilderness behind their eyes”. “It’s not a thinking place,” he wrote. “But a deep cave of fortitude.” Horne-Francis is in the system now. He’ll be tagged, harassed and analysed to within an inch of his life. He’ll carry the hopes of a football club. He looks like the can handle it. But in the spirit of Trade Radio and Show Me The Money, that’s just a guess.",Sport/Sport,AFL players on the periphery with agents front and centre during trade period | Jonathan Horn,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/10/afl-players-on-the-periphery-with-agents-front-and-centre-during-trade-period
3/10/2022,"The Israeli defence contractor Elbit Systems has denied producing cluster munitions after two big investment funds banned investment in the company, saying it was involved with the weapons. Cluster munitions are outlawed under Australian law and an international treaty because of their devastating effect on civilians. Both Australia’s sovereign wealth fund, the $200bn Future Fund, and Norway’s largest pension fund, the $136bn KLP, have banned investment in Elbit over its alleged association with certain weapons. Cluster munitions, which were allegedly used by Russian forces during the invasion of Ukraine, are bombs that contain smaller bomblets that scatter as they drop from the air. Under an international convention they are banned by 110 states, including Australia, because they kill and maim civilians and because, like landminesthey can remain a deadly hazard years after a conflict is over. Israel is not a signatory. Government tender data shows that Elbit, which employs the former minister for defence Christopher Pyne as a lobbyist, is a major supplier to the Australian defence force, winning more than $1.8bn of work since 2007. This includes a controversial battle management system, designed to keep commanders in touch with troops in the field. The army last year ordered troops to stop using the system amid reports of security fears among soldiers. Elbit has consistently denied there are any security issues with its system. “The June 2021 Senate Estimates, Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee heard from the Department of Defence and Australian Signals Directorate there have been no security issues with our software,” a spokesperson said. Elbit has also repeatedly denied making cluster munitions since 2018, when it took over IMI Systems, formerly known as Israeli Military Industries, which previously produced the weapons. In its public declaration of excluded companies, the Future Fund lists Elbit Systems as one of eight firms barred from investment because of “exclusions related to military weapons-related Conventions or Treaties ratified by Australia”. The Future Fund declined to explain in detail why it last year excluded Elbit from investment, with a spokesperson saying the decision was based on data that could not be passed on to Guardian Australia because it was the intellectual property of a third-party information provider company. But in a report released in November, KLP said it was excluding Elbit Systems from its investments because “it is clear that the company produces cluster munitions”. In its report, KLP provided details, including model numbers of the cluster munitions it claims Elbit produces through IMI Systems. These include “miniature intelligent multipurpose submunitions”, which are “a smart cluster munitions system equipped with sensors to program and identify targets”, as well as conventional munitions that each contain dozens of bomblets, KLP said. KLP’s head of responsible investments, Kiran Aziz, told Guardian Australia the fund got much of its information about Elbit from MSCI, an American financial information provider. “In addition, we use publicly available information from NGOs and what a company reports,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Asked why KLP did not believe Elbit’s denials of involvement in cluster munitions, she said: “We relied on information we have from MSCI as our data provider which is quite updated.” However, she said KLP did not claim that Elbit produced the bomblet that sits inside the cluster munitions systems it allegedly produces. “Elbit was already excluded due to a violation of our criterion of human rights violations for their involvement in the occupied Palestinian territory,” she said. “They have now also been excluded under our criterion of involvement in controversial weapons. The reason why we exclude companies with reference to several criteria when they have already been excluded, is that all the reasons are important to state, and that we do not want to risk the companies being included in the portfolio again if the first exclusion basis ceases.” In a 15 February letter, provided by Elbit to Guardian Australia, the company’s chief legal officer and executive vice president, Jonathan Ariel, said Elbit “has never been engaged in the production or sale of cluster munitions”. “Following the acquisition of IMI Systems Ltd in 2018, Elbit Systems discontinued all activities of IMI relating to IMI’s legacy cluster munitions,” he said. He said the company, including IMI, complied with the international convention banning cluster munitions. Rawan Arraf, executive director of Australian Centre for International Justice, said the Future Fund was right to be concerned about Elbit’s alleged association with cluster munitions but that it should also be concerned about its supply of the surveillance systems and other products and services used by Israeli authorities, which she says amounts to aiding and abetting serious human rights abuses against the Palestinian people. “There is a major incongruity when an Australian public agency rightly excludes Elbit Systems, yet Australian state and federal governments happily enter into lucrative contractual agreements with it.” The defence department did not respond to detailed questions about its dealings with Elbit.

3/10/2022,"How can I help my child worry less about all that’s happening in the world? In the last two-odd years, children in Australia have witnessed devastating bushfires, been locked down in their homes due to a pandemic, and more recently, seen parts of their country ravaged by floods as a war unfolded on the other side of the world. All of this has been quite hard to stomach even for the thick-skinned adults, so it’s no wonder that parents are concerned about the emotional toll the negative news cycle might be having on their children. Prof Lea Waters, a psychologist and researcher at the University of Melbourne, says parents can help their kids deal with this by talking to them about what’s taking place – be it war, the devastating impacts of climate change or pandemics – and be guided by their age and their personalities when it comes to discussing such world events. “You would talk to teens in more detail than you would talk to younger kids,” she says. While past parenting trends might have favoured a well-meaning “don’t tell” approach as the means of protecting kids, it’s a method that isn’t necessarily ideal right now, Waters says. “Kids are smart, they’ve got social media and their friends talk [about such news], so all you’re actually doing [by not discussing] is preventing your child from emotionally processing. “The psychology research shows that the way to protect them is to talk to them in an age-appropriate way that’s informing, but not overwhelming.” For Waters, this means carefully addressing their present and future state of mind in response to the bad news cycle. “I think that a lot of kids would be feeling that the world is falling down around them and all these big things are happening that they can’t control,” she says. “The emotional response is going to be fear and anxiety – fear is the emotion of ‘I’m unsafe right now’, and anxiety is more future-oriented, [a fear] that something bad is going to happen in the future.” Waters says in the past two years, the pattern of anxiety has been consistent. She recommends using everyday moments and conversations as a way to reassure children about their future and wellbeing. “The fear is in the present moment, so it’s about saying ‘I know it’s hard to see what’s happening in the world’, but reassuring them of their own safety right now,” she says. In her view, this can be done with practical steps such as showing children that their residential block, for instance, is fireproof, or telling them that they are not in a flood zone. The conversation about overcoming fear and anxiety might look a little different if the family does happen to be living in a danger zone, but the reassurance is still imperative. “Let the [children] know that you have a safety plan,” Waters says. “Explain the safety plan to your kids, tell them what you have done and what you’re going to do. It’s about not overwhelming the child with all the details of the safety plan, but more like ‘we’ve bought sandbags’ or ‘you bring the teddy bear, or the dog’.” According to Waters, one of the big causes of fear and anxiety for children is the loss of control, “so giving them little tasks that they can have control over is going to help them feel less out of control”. Sticking to a predictable routine like a family movie night, dog bathing, or walking around the block adds normalcy and helps children feel safe – as does physical connection with their parents or carers. “Kids feel safe when they can hug their mom and hug their dad, and that’s because physical touch triggers an oxytocin response,” she explains. “Oxytocin is a neurohormone [that] floods our body, and when we have high levels of oxytocin it shuts off cortisol, [which] is our stress and fear hormone.” But when it comes to anxiety, it is quite uncertain – just like the future. “The way you would normally reduce anxiety is to talk about a positive future, which is a little bit hard for us parents because of everything that’s happening in the world. “Localising the conversation to things within a two-year time period, such taking a family holiday, transitioning from primary school to high school, or starting a new hobby, moving to a new house … can help to reduce that anxiety by presenting some certainty about the future.” Survivor’s guilt, Waters explains, might also be a recurring concern in many families. How can we raise children to be attuned to the suffering of others without making them feel guilty about their own lives? “Start with [addressing] the suffering, then progress to the positive in order to restore resilience,” she advises. “You’ve got to recognise the hurt and the pain but [also] acknowledge there are small moments of good that we have to latch on to. You have to use that positivity as a feedback loop back into the pain.” Waters says it’s important, too, to distinguish between resolving the problems and supporting those who are suffering. Sharon Turner, school psychologist at Strathcona Girls Grammar, encourages parents to create moments of joy and connection with their kids in nature to restore balance and emotional wellbeing, and recommends checking in with those who have experienced grief, loss, trauma or war to let them know you’re up for a chat or some support. She also suggests small, practical tips for kids keen to do a little more. “Take action,” she says. “Children can write a letter to the local member of federal parliament, send care packages or messages to those in affected areas, place flags in their windows and make a chalk drawing of support on their footpaths.” Participating in fundraisers and raising awareness in your own communities also helps. Waters suggests explaining to children that their wellbeing is pivotal in being able to help others. She gives an example of what a parent might say to their child: “You being happy in Australia might help you build your resilience and reserves, so that when you are old enough to step in and help [others] you have the capacity to do so.”  Sarah Ayoub is a journalist, academic and author of books for young adults and children",Opinion/Opinion,"How can I reassure my child about current affairs?
