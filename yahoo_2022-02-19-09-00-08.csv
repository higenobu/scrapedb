2/19/2022,"Getty Images / Valeriia Sviridova / EyeEm Staying hydrated is one of the best things you can do for your health. It can help with everything from healthy heart function and skin elasticity to making you happier and more productive. However, most Americans don't drink enough water, which can lead to chronic dehydration. Dehydration comes with a slew of nasty side effects like mental fog, overeating and even higher stroke risk. There are many healthy ways to stay hydrated. You can carry a reusable water bottle with you to sip throughout the day, or nosh on hydrating foods like watermelon, tomatoes and beans (most raw fruits and vegetables have a high water content). That said, more water isn't necessarily better. Chugging as much water as you can all day is likely not the best or most efficient way to stay hydrated, and it's technically possible to overdo it. There is such a thing as overhydration that causes some unwanted and potentially dangerous side effects. Overhydrating can result in what's called hyponatremia, where you retain water but flush out necessary electrolytes like sodium and potassium. This causes cells all over the body to swell and can lead to nausea, vomiting, dizziness and, in rare cases, even death. Endurance athletes such as marathon runners or triathletes are at a higher risk of hyponatremia during competition, as it is common to take in large quantities of water while losing sodium and potassium through sweating. Does this mean you should avoid drinking water to avoid overhydration? No. But it does mean that you may want to be mindful of electrolytes and include other forms of hydration throughout the day. One 2015 study found that other drinks might be more hydrating than water alone in the short term. They found that milk, tea and orange juice were slightly more hydrating, while beer was slightly (but not significantly) less hydrating. The reason for this could be due to the role of the electrolytes sodium, calcium, potassium, chloride, phosphate and magnesium. These electrolytes are minerals in the body with a variety of functions, one of which is fluid balance. Plain water does not contain electrolytes, but foods and other drinks oftentimes do. That's why it's important to make sure you include food or drink sources of these minerals along with plenty of water to stay balanced throughout the day. In summary, water is still super important for hydration, and most of us should be more concerned about dehydration than overhydration ( here's how much water you should be drinking each day). But it's important to mix in electrolytes from foods or drinks throughout the day, especially if you are exercising at a high intensity. When it comes to drinking water, slow and consistent wins the race.",Health/Eating Well,Why Drinking Water All Day Long Is Not the Best Way to Stay Hydrated,https://news.yahoo.com/why-drinking-water-day-long-224850076.html

2/19/2022,"Ava Majury's father shot a stalker who came to their house in 2021, The New York Times reported. On the day of the shooting, Majury posted TikToks to her account. Her mother told The Times they didn't want to let ""sick individuals"" stop her from being online. A 15-year-old TikTok star whose father shot an armed stalker who came to their house in Florida continued to make videos immediately after the incident, without giving any indication of what happened. The shooting occurred on July 10, 2021, when Eric Rohan Justin went to the house of TikToker Ava Majury and blasted the front door open with a shotgun, The New York Times reported on Thursday. After his weapon jammed, he fled the scene but soon returned, according to the newspaper. Then, Ava's father, Rob Majury, said he shot Justin, according to The Times. The 18-year-old Justin had been following Ava online for more than a year, and bought selfie photos from Ava and pictures of and information about her from some of her friends, according to The Times. He also sent texts to a classmate of Ava asking whether he had a gun and told him about plans to assault the young teen, including saying, ""i could just breach the door with a shotgun i think,"" the newspaper reported. Ava has over 1.2 million followers and 57 million likes across all her videos. Her earliest TikToks date back to April 2020, and most of her content featured her lip-syncing to audios and dancing. On the day of the shooting, she posted a video of her mouthing the words to a slow-motion version of French Montana's ""Unforgettable."" She shared another lip sync video the next day, and then took a five-day break from posting TikToks, resuming her regular frequency after that. The Majurys were shaken after the event and temporarily lived at a friend's house, according to the Times. Ava's mother, Kim Majury, told The Times her daughter was still active online because they didn't want to allow ""sick individuals"" to keep her from using social media and told the newspaper, ""maybe she's meant to bring awareness to all this."" Ava said she worried if her followers knew about the shooting, then people might ""think I attracted him"" or that other followers would ""make it a contest"" to go to her house, according to The Times. Ava has continued to post TikToks as of February 2022. Ava did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment on Friday.

2/19/2022,"A federal judge ruled that Trump can be held civilly liable for the Capitol riot. He also said Trump does not have absolute immunity from civil suits. ""The court well understands the gravity of its decision,"" the ruling said. ""But the alleged facts of this case are without precedent."" A federal judge ruled on Friday that former President Donald Trump can be held civilly liable for the deadly Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. Trump's speech before his supporters stormed the Capitol, during which he called on them to ""fight like hell"" against the 2020 election results, ""can reasonably be viewed as a call for collective action,"" US District Judge Amit Mehta wrote in a 112-page ruling. He pointed to specific statements in which Trump used the word ""we,"" including: ""We will not take it anymore."" ""We will stop the steal."" ""We will never give up."" ""We will never concede."" ""All Mike Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify, and we become president."" ""We're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue."" The word ""we"" being ""used repeatedly in this context implies that the President and rally-goers would be acting together toward a common goal,"" Mehta wrote. ""That is the essence of a civil conspiracy."" The focus of Mehta's ruling were three civil lawsuits brought against Trump by Democratic lawmakers and Capitol Police officers who defended the building on January 6. The judge ruled on Friday that Trump is not immune from the litigation and can be held accountable for his actions and statements related to the Capitol riot. Mehta acknowledged the import of his decision but said that the events of January 6 were unprecedented. ""To deny a President immunity from civil damages is no small step,"" the ruling said. ""The court well understands the gravity of its decision. But the alleged facts of this case are without precedent."" Mehta also noted that Trump was not acting in his capacity as president when he held the rally and told his supporters to march to the Capitol. ""After all, the President's actions here do not relate to his duties of faithfully executing the laws, conducting foreign affairs, commanding the armed forces, or managing the Executive Branch,"" the ruling said. ""They entirely concern his efforts to remain in office for a second term. These are unofficial acts, so the separation-of-powers concerns that justify the President's broad immunity are not present here."" The judge also said that the allegations in the civil lawsuits against Trump are enough to establish ""a plausible ... conspiracy involving President Trump."" That conspiracy includes the far-right groups Proud Boys and Oath Keepers and others who stormed the Capitol on January 6, Mehta added. He highlighted that a ""civil conspiracy"" does not require an express agreement between those involved. ""A tacit agreement — one that is 'implied or indicated ... but not actually expressed' — is enough,"" the ruling said. ""The key is that the conspirators share the same general conspiratorial objective, or a single plan the essential nature and general scope of which is known to all conspirators."" Friday's ruling is a major blow to Trump and comes in the wake of several other legal losses. On Thursday, a Manhattan judge ruled that Trump and his two eldest children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka, must sit for depositions in the New York attorney general Tish James' ongoing investigation into whether the Trump Organization violated banking, tax, and insurance laws. And earlier this week, Trump's longtime accounting firm cut ties with him after concluding that, in the wake of James' recent findings, ten years of Trump's financial statements ""should no longer be relied upon.""
