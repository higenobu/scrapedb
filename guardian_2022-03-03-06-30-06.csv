3/3/2022,"Pamela Anderson has announced an “intimate” and “definitive” new documentary at Netflix. The actor and activist revealed on Instagram that her years-in-the-making movie would land at the streamer, in the wake of the controversial Hulu series Pam & Tommy which was made without her approval or involvement. The statement reads: “My life. A thousand imperfections. A million misperceptions. Wicked, wild and lost. Nothing to live up to. I can only surprise you. Not a victim, but a survivor. And alive to tell the real story.” The as-yet-untitled documentary comes from director Ryan White, whose credits include Netflix docuseries The Keepers and 2019’s Ask Dr Ruth while Anderson’s son, Brandon Thomas Lee will be among the producers. It will feature exclusive access to Anderson as well as her personal journals. A Netflix tweet added that the film will “feature the pop culture icon setting the record straight as she looks back on her professional path and her personal journey”. The announcement comes soon after the launch of Pam & Tommy, the narrative series that relives the fallout from the leaked sex tape between Anderson and Tommy Lee starring Lily James and Sebastian Stan. Anderson was allegedly contacted by the production for her involvement but was uninterested. “I wish it had been different,” James said in an interview with Porter, detailing that she also reached out to Anderson personally. “My sole intention was to take care of the story and to play Pamela authentically.” Those close to the former Baywatch actor have claimed that the star is unhappy that the project exists. In May 2021, Courtney Love claimed the existence of the show was causing Anderson “complex trauma”. A source also told Entertainment Tonight that it was “very painful for Pamela Anderson and for anyone that loves her”.",Arts/Film,Pamela Anderson to ‘tell the real story’ in Netflix documentary,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/02/pamela-anderson-real-story-netflix-documentary
3/3/2022,"Marilyn Manson has filed a lawsuit against Evan Rachel Wood for defamation over the actor’s sexual abuse allegations against him. Manson, the American “shock rocker” born Brian Warner, filed the complaint in Los Angeles superior court on Wednesday. The complaint accuses Wood and her “on-again, off-again” partner Ashley “Illma” Gore, of depicting him as “a rapist and abuser – a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner’s successful music, TV, and film career.” Representatives for Wood and Gore did not respond to request for comment from Deadline, which first reported the lawsuit. Wood and Gore appear in Phoenix Rising, a new documentary about Wood’s life and career that is scheduled to premiere on HBO this month. It also details Wood’s allegations against Manson. In the documentary, Wood said that during a previously discussed “simulated sex scene” for the music video of Manson’s 2007 single Heart-Shaped Glasses, Manson “started penetrating me for real” and that she “had never agreed to that”. Wood said she was given absinthe on set, which affected her ability to refuse Manson’s alleged actions. Warner has denied raping Wood on the set of the music video. In Wednesday’s filing, Manson accused Wood and Gore of “falsifying and spreading” allegations against him. He claims they pretended to be an FBI agent by “forging and distributing a fictitious letter from the agent, to create the false appearance” that Manson was under a federal criminal investigation. Manson alleges that Wood and Gore “provided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, listing the specific alleged acts of abuse that they should claim against Warner”. The suit accuses Gore of trying to obtain Manson’s login information to his computer, phone and email and claims that she created a fake email address to claim that Manson was sending pornography to contacts. In addition to requesting a jury trial, Manson has accused Wood of inflicting emotional distress, violation of the Comprehensive Computer Data and Access Fraud Act, and impersonation over the internet. In a statement, Howard King, Manson’s attorney said: “Even though HBO and the producers have been made aware of these serious acts of misconduct, they have thus far chosen to proceed without regard for the facts. But the evidence of wrongdoing by Wood and Gore is irrefutable – and this legal action will hold them to account.”",Arts/Music,Marilyn Manson files defamation suit against sexual abuse accuser Evan Rachel Wood,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/02/marilyn-manson-defamation-lawsuit-evan-rachel-wood
3/3/2022,"Stop all the clocks. Stow the faux-fur hats. Delete the Russian folk music from the pre-match playlist. Roman Abramovich is now officially looking for a buyer. Indeed, if we are to believe the reports, Chelsea Football Club could even be sold within the week. It is an impossibly narrow timeframe for such a complex transaction, made credible only by the fact that, frankly, right how anything seems possible. Perhaps even, who knows, a little honest reflection on Chelsea’s departing owner, who remains the single most lavish individual investor in the history of European football; but even now a strangely opaque and mysterious year-zero billionaire. As Abramovich’s benevolent Chelsea dictatorship draws to an end, as even the lavish London houses – no, not the lavish London houses – are rushed to market, all against a backdrop of war, sanctions and the denial of Kremlin ties, perhaps the most extraordinary aspect right now is the memory of those early days when this bashful, oddly sullen-looking suitor emerged blinking into the Stamford Bridge light and began the process of complete and irreversible transformation. It is 19 years since Abramovich bought Chelsea from Ken Bates for £140m. Looking back now at the late summer sunshine of 2003, it feels like an oddly gauche and guileless world. In the stands the fans threw mock paper roubles. The newspapers goggled over £200,000 cars, the failed attempt to buy an entire ski resort, the high-end super-divorce. Chelsea spent so much money they had to invent Financial Fair Play. And three years into Vladimir Putin’s version of Russia Abramovich looked at that moment like a vanguard of some new human category, the billionaire uber-lad, with his yacht-flash, his Riviera tan, his endless no-strings spending. For Chelsea the years since have brought on-field glory at unrecoupable expense, all of it overseen with an air of gloomy command by that sphinx-like arm’s-length presence. Over time there has been an enduring singularity too. Abramovich leaves the stage as he entered it: a club of one, the only disinterested, endlessly benevolent single-person owner of any football club anywhere. The man with the suit and the face is leaving the building. And still the most obvious question remains. Who was this person exactly? And what, exactly, have we just been party to? Perhaps in the months to come it will be possible to have an open discussion about the meaning of Roman; and to examine forensically sport’s role in the wider culture. Even, who knows, to learn some lessons about protecting these valuable assets. There has certainly been some concern about Abramovich’s motives. In January of this year David Davis MP spoke in the House of Commons about the use of the English legal system to control, as he saw it, the reporting of the activities of wealthy Russians. Davis expressed his views on Abramovich too. “It is worth reminding people of Mr Abramovich’s background and the character of the man. We are speaking here of the man who manages President Putin’s private economic affairs, according to the Spanish national intelligence committee. This is a man who was refused a Swiss residency permit, due to suspected involvement in money laundering and contacts with criminal organisations. Abramovich was also deemed a danger to public security and a reputational risk to Switzerland.” A little later Davis added: “When he bought Chelsea FC, Abramovich was the governor of the Chukotka region of Russia. It was alleged by associates of his that the purchase was done at the behest of the Kremlin. As a result of the purchase, he now has enormous soft power and influence in the UK. I ask the House to come to its own conclusion about whether this man is acting at the behest of the Kremlin or Putin’s Government.” It is important to note that Abramovich has vehemently and repeatedly denied having access to, favour with or any special relationship with Putin or the Kremlin. Abramovich also denies that he was motivated in any way by Putin to buy Chelsea FC. He denies that his ownership of the club has anything to do with soft power or political ends. It is also worth noting that Davis has been an MP for 35 years in the same ruling Conservative party that has overseen the flow of Russian money and Russian influence into the heart of London’s financial industry, legal system and, yes, its politics (the same Conservative party that is funded to a startling degree by donations from Russian-born patrons). What is most striking here is that, whatever the truth of Davis’s statements, it has still taken this long, to the point where the world has begun to burn, before anyone in a position of power has felt alarmed enough to investigate. If this is what David Davis thinks, if his colleagues in the House are similarly alarmed, why has no one, from government to the Premier League, felt moved to show some concern for the fate of Chelsea Football Club? Why, given the scenario Davis describes, has this same government refused to apply statutory force to the suggestions for a football regulator? Instead of which Abramovich’s time at Chelsea has coincided with the embrace of an unfettered global market, with an apolitical, ideological amoral approach to club ownership. Don’t ask. Don’t regulate. Just check the bottom line. This outlook seems increasingly blind to the way big sport works. Football is the popular culture now, Premier League clubs powerful engines for public relations and soft power, so much so that the term sportswashing already seems a little wet and outmoded. If the iconography of Putin and sport tells us anything, if there is any lesson to be gleaned from his use of Fifa and the International Olympic Committee as a global tannoy system, it is that there can be hard edges here, a direction of travel that goes beyond simply promoting the tourist industry. Two English Premier League clubs are owned by nation state governments, one via a private equity fund run by the crown prince himself. Why do these politicians want to own English sporting clubs? There can surely be no doubt this is, on some level, foreign policy. Saudi Arabia in particular is on a charm offensive, building alliances and establishing itself as a state that no longer needs to have its security guaranteed by the US. Mohammed bin Salman, chair of Newcastle’s fund, could be seen high-fiving Putin at the G20 summit not so long ago. This is not to impute hostile motives, merely to be aware that a larger game is in train, that football is a part of the surrounding noise, and that clubs are fragile pawns in this stagecraft, the loyalties of supporters and surrounding media piggybacked with surprising ease. Right up until the point the world moves on. For Chelsea the future looks uncertain. Even if a buyer can be found to act quickly enough, the club has been reliant on the owner’s deep pockets to function at its current level. The £187m wage bill, the grandiose new stadium plans (now discontinued), the high-priced signings: none of this would have been possible without £1.5bn in personal loans. The good times will have to roll in some other, more metered fashion from here. That era is now gone, wrenched out at the roots with startling haste. For the rest of English football, and indeed all sport, there is a lesson to be learned in its unravelling.",Sport/Football,Roman Abramovich era unravels to plunge Chelsea into the unknown | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/02/roman-abramovich-chelsea-uncertain-future
3/3/2022,"Labour backbenchers including John McDonnell and Diane Abbott have pulled out of attending a Stop the War rally in London on Wednesday amid pressure from Keir Starmer over the group’s stance on Ukraine. The Labour leader told his party’s MPs on Monday there was “no place” in the party for anyone drawing a “false equivalence” between the actions of Nato and those of Moscow. Labour sources had suggested that if backbenchers made any comments at the Wednesday evening rally that were critical of Nato or sought to blame the western alliance for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it could lead to the whip being withdrawn. McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, subsequently released a statement saying he would not attend the event at Conway Hall in London despite being listed as a speaker. “People are dying on the streets of Ukrainian cities. This is not the time to be distracted by political arguments here,” he told the website LabourList. “Nothing is more important at this time. Nothing should distract us from that. So I won’t feed into that distraction by going tonight.” Abbott, the former shadow home secretary, told the Guardian she would not be attending either. During the event, a man waving a Ukrainian flag interrupted the end of Jeremy Corbyn’s speech. The man was then forcibly removed from Conway Hall. Some leftwing Labour MPs believe Starmer is seeking a pretext to suspend them from the party, and are keen not to hand him any opportunity to do so. McDonnell said it was important for socialists to “stay on the pitch for as long as it takes”. McDonnell and Abbott were among 11 Labour backbenchers who yielded to pressure from the party’s chief whip last week and withdrew their names from a Stop the War motion urging Nato to “call a halt to its eastward expansion” and accusing the UK government of “sabre-rattling” over Ukraine. Starmer is keen to press home the shift in Labour’s approach to foreign affairs since he took over from Corbyn a year ago. He has offered staunch support to the government over Ukraine while pushing for tougher action on sanctions. The Labour leader used a Guardian article last month to attack Stop the War, in which Corbyn continues to play a prominent role, effectively accusing the group of siding with Russia. “At best they are naive, at worst they actively give succour to authoritarian leaders who directly threaten democracies. There is nothing progressive in showing solidarity with the aggressor,” Starmer wrote. A Labour spokesperson said: “Keir Starmer has set out the position of the Labour party and that is the position we expect every Labour MP to follow.” Asked whether Stop the War could be proscribed by the party, so that Labour members would effectively be banned from supporting it, he added: “That would be a matter for the national executive committee.” Andrew Murray, deputy president of Stop the War alongside Corbyn, condemned the approach, saying: “Keir Starmer’s authoritarian fear of Stop the War demeans him and the Labour party, not us. We have been proved right on Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya where Labour leaders were wrong. We are right in demanding de-escalation in Ukraine too, including immediate Russian troop withdrawal and a halt to Nato expansion.” Corbyn still has the whip suspended over his reaction to the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s critical report on Labour’s handling of antisemitism complaints under his leadership. He now sits as an independent and unless Starmer restores the whip will not be allowed to stand as a Labour candidate at the next general election.",News/Politics,John McDonnell and Diane Abbott pull out of Stop the War rally,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/02/john-mcdonnell-and-diane-abbott-pull-out-of-stop-the-war-rally
3/3/2022,"Social media is currently infested with people professing to be “empaths” who are suffering cruelly (with no apparent discount for it being remotely and, uh, imaginatively) through the crisis in Ukraine. It is sickening to watch, not least because it clothes narcissism in one of humanity’s finer qualities. The ability to put oneself in another’s shoes and stand there, looking out alertly and intelligently from that point of view, marks us out from the beasts as surely as language. The ability to empathise on camera without appearing inauthentic and being emetic is a refinement of such a gift, and one without which many human interest programmes become unwatchable. That Your Body Uncovered With Kate Garraway (BBC Two) succeeds at all is down to her genuine interest in people and ability to say the right thing with the right degree of sentiment. The whole thing is heightened, of course, by the knowledge of what she is going through at home, caring for her husband Derek Draper. He has been incapacitated – possibly long-term – by the after-effects of Covid and, as she put it in a recent interview, she has been learning to love him in a different way. The base fact is that Your Body Uncovered is, once the novelty has worn off, quite boring. The conceit is that people with (often chronic) medical conditions get to see the problem from the inside out, courtesy of numerous scans amalgamated to produce a 3D image that viewers can see at home. The patient can walk round inside the affected body part wearing virtual reality goggles while a doctor talks us through the distended viscera we can see. Isn’t technology amazing? Yes, it is. But not for long. Particularly not when the cutting edge of artificial and human intelligence is used to show us the inside of … a frozen shoulder. Such is the complaint of Trudi, a lovely 50-year-old mum of three and grandmother of one. Anyone acquainted with the condition will feel for her, especially as she is clearly the hub of her family and increasingly constricted physically and dependent for help on those she would prefer to be helping. Still, the inward appearance of a stranger’s frozen shoulder is only slightly more interesting than the outward appearance of a stranger’s frozen shoulder. Which is to say – not very. Watching the graphic skeleton overlaid with a layer of inflamed, red tissue was more like listening to someone tell you about their dreams than providing any groundbreaking insight. Ditto watching the treatment – steroid injections, which are very painful in reality, but visually anaesthetising. Hilda’s fibroids are far more rewarding, and therein lies the essential ickiness of all such programmes. They rely on extremity and slip unstoppably further towards exploitation as they do so. Sweet, gentle Hilda, 40, a fashion influencer, has an abdomen that is grossly distended by innumerable uterine fibroids. She is in terrible pain, bleeding virtually unmanageably for three out of four weeks and effectively insomniac because her bladder is so squashed that she must wee several times a night. As her best friend puts it, “She basically can’t live.” The obvious questions – her history, how things got to this point, what doctors have said up to now – go largely unasked because it’s not that sort of show. There is a suggestion late on that she has been reluctant to agree to surgery, but no explanation of why. Perhaps she was only offered a full hysterectomy instead of the removal of the growth and shied away from the implications, as she says she desperately wants children. But we don’t know. At a time when reports of how neglected and underfunded matters concerning women’s health are, how frequently doctors dismiss their reported pain, and even how much higher mortality rates are for women treated by male surgeons have made headlines, the superficiality of this programme becomes unignorable. And the pat conclusion – Hilda will be operated on by the lovely doctor/presenter and we will see her able to fit into the clothes she prefers instead of the baggy dresses of necessity … oh, and without a hysterectomy so, uh, yay! Garraway just about keeps the whole thing together with her warmth and wit, but it’s hard to avoid the feeling by the end that however clever the technology and able the presenter, this approach just won’t do any more.",Arts/Television & radio,Your Body Uncovered With Kate Garraway review – terminally dull!

3/3/2022,"Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida and a serious contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, has said France would not put up a fight if Russia invaded, as it did in Ukraine. “A lot of other places around the world, they just fold the minute there’s any type of adversity,” DeSantis told reporters at a press event at South Florida University in Tampa on Wednesday. “I mean can you imagine if he [Vladimir Putin] went into France? Would they do anything to put up a fight? Probably not.” The governor also began the event by angrily attacking students present on the stage with him for wearing masks against Covid-19. “You do not have to wear those masks,” DeSantis said, pointing a finger. “I mean, please take them off. Honestly, it’s not doing anything and we’ve gotta stop with this Covid theatre. So if you want to wear it, fine, but this is ridiculous.” Federal authorities have relaxed mask guidance in much of the US but the coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 950,000 – and more than 70,000 in Florida alone. Anyone French who saw DeSantis’s remark might remember the bad jokes (“cheese-eating surrender monkeys”) and Orwellian doublespeak (french fries renamed “freedom fries”) that followed Jacques Chirac’s refusal to back the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. Amid much online mockery of DeSantis’s remarks, Maggie Haberman, a New York Times reporter, tweeted: “He went to Yale.” DeSantis also went to Harvard, to study law. Before entering politics, he was a Jag or US navy lawyer in Iraq and at Guantánamo Bay. He regularly polls second in surveys of likely contenders for the Republican presidential nomination, behind Donald Trump. On Wednesday, after dissing the whole of France, he had praise for Ukrainians fighting the Russian invasion. “And so those folks are stepping up,” he said, “but it’s, there’s a lot of problems I think between now and then and I think unfortunately it’s going to end up very, very ugly over the next weeks and months.” He also offered his view of Putin’s psyche, the evils of communism and whether the US should develop its own energy resources, at the expense of federal lands and efforts to fight the climate crisis, in order to lessen reliance on Russia. “Look at what’s going on and someone like Vladimir Putin,” he said. “You know, I analogise him to basically an authoritarian gas station attendant. “You look at their country, it’s a hollowed-out country but for the energy. And yes they have legacy nuclear weapons, which makes them much more dangerous than if they didn’t have those. “And so [Putin is] being fueled because America is not serious about energy independence. Right now Europe is not serious at all. So Europe is funding this guy. So he has the ability now to go in and flex muscle.” DeSantis also said Republicans under Trump “funded a lot of weapons for Ukraine … that has helped them put up a fight”.

3/3/2022,"Ukraine is facing a humanitarian crisis, international health experts have warned, as relentless Russian missile attacks on residential areas in several cities have left hundreds of civilians dead and forced more than 800,000 to flee the country. As Moscow, defying global condemnation and overwhelming political and economic isolation, claimed on Wednesday to have seized the first large city of its campaign and the Ukrainian president accused it of aiming to “erase” his country, the World Health Organization said some health supplies were already starting to run out. “We are moving closer to a humanitarian crisis,” Jarno Hubicht, the WHO representative in Ukraine, said. “This is moving very fast. Health service provisions are being moved to shelters and basements. We are concerned about electricity provision, oxygen and medicines.” WHO’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the group was also working to verify multiple reports of “attacks on health facilities and health workers”, adding that attacks on healthcare would be “a violation of international humanitarian law”. In New York, the UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to deplore Russia’s attack “in the strongest possible terms” and demand the immediate withdrawal of its forces, after Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, compared the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to Hitler. Kyslytsya said the invasion was intended “to deprive Ukraine of the very right to exist”, adding: “They have come to resolve the Ukrainian issue. More than 80 years ago, another dictator tried to finally resolve the issue of another people. He failed.” A second round of talks between the two sides is due to get under way on Thursday, Russian negotiators reportedly said, adding that a ceasefire was “on the agenda”. However, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing cities if any progress is to be made. More than 350 civilians, including 14 children, have been killed and more than 2,000 wounded since the invasion began, Ukraine’s emergency service said, adding that hundreds of buildings – transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens, homes – had been destroyed. “Children, women and defence forces are losing their lives every hour,” it said. The UN refugee agency said 836,000 people had now fled Ukraine, mostly women and children but including many foreign students and migrant workers, and the number was rising rapidly. At least 450,000 have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland, the government in Warsaw said, with 113,000 arriving in Romania. The UK and 37 other countries formally referred reports of atrocities committed in Ukraine to the international criminal court (ICC). Under ICC rules, such a referral from member states means that the prosecutor does not have to get the approval of ICC judges before opening an investigation, speeding up the process. “With 37 countries joining the UK, it is the largest referral in the history of the ICC,” said Britain’s Foreign Office. The European Commission on Wednesday proposed granting temporary protection to refugees from the Ukraine conflict, including a residence permit and access to employment and social welfare in all member states. After seven days of fighting, the Russian defence ministry in Moscow claimed its forces had taken control of the strategically important city of Kherson on the Black Sea. Reports said contact had been established between Russian troops and the city council. After repeated missile strikes on Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, that have hit non-military buildings including a hospital and university and killed at least 25 civilians, Russian airborne troops landed in the city at about 3am on Wednesday, officials said, and were engaged in heavy fighting. Kharkiv’s mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said every fourth person in the city had relatives in Russia, but the city’s attitude to the country today was “completely different. We never expected this could happen: total destruction, annihilation, genocide against the Ukrainian people – this is unforgivable.” Oleksiy Demchenko, a 27-year-old computer programmer in the city, said: “To tell the truth, it’s hell. They are hitting people’s houses, health facilities, parks. I think their goal is to break us psychologically because they want us to evacuate. But our army will protect us. People won’t surrender.” The south-eastern city of Mariupol had also been under increasingly intense shelling since late on Tuesday night and was unable even to evacuate the wounded, according to its mayor, Vadym Boichenko. “Russian forces have been flattening us non-stop for 12 hours now,” he said. Massed Russian forces also appeared to be preparing for a decisive advance on the capital, Kyiv. “The enemy is drawing up forces closer to the capital,” the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. “Kyiv is holding and will hold. We are going to fight.” In its first statement on casualties on Wednesday, the Russian defence ministry said 498 Russian soldiers had been killed in Ukraine since the beginning of its invasion, and 1,597 wounded. A Ukrainian military adviser said more than 7,000 Russians have been killed and hundreds taken prisoner, including senior officers. The Ukrainian president said Russia aimed to erase Ukraine, its history and its people. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a short video statement that the west must do more to help his country. He said a Russian missile attack on Kyiv that struck close to the Babyn Yar memorial, where occupying Nazi troops in the second world war massacred almost the entire Jewish population of the capital, showed how little many in Russia knew about Ukraine. “They don’t know a thing about Kyiv, about our history,” Zelenskiy said. “But they all have orders to erase our history, erase our country, erase us all.” He urged EU governments to support Ukraine’s request for urgent accession to the bloc. The Russian advance has been met by fiercer resistance than Moscow seems to have expected. US observers have said a long Russian armoured convoy north of Kyiv seems to have stalled, hampered by logistics issues including food and fuel shortages. Some units are reported to have low morale. But military experts have said they are concerned Russia is shifting tactics, relying on the kind of heavy artillery and air bombardments it deployed in Chechnya and Syria to pulverise urban centres and crush defending forces’ resolve. Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, said Russia’s actions qualified as war crimes. With its air force heavily outnumbered, Ukraine has called on Nato to establish a no-fly zone over the country, a request western governments are reluctant to consider because of the risk that it would bring the alliance into direct armed conflict with the world’s largest nuclear power. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, on Wednesday ruled out a no-fly zone, saying it would “lead to a war against Russia across the whole of Europe” but also prevent Ukrainian pilots being able to target Russian forces from the air, giving an advantage to Moscow’s stronger ground troops and tanks. The Russian president drew global condemnation for ordering the invasion of Ukraine last Thursday, and the west has responded with sanctions aimed at shutting Russia’s economy off from the global financial system and forcing international companies to cut their ties with the aggressor. The measures have sent the rouble plunging to historic lows and raised the prospect of severe recession in Russia. China, however, said on Wednesday it would not be joining western financial sanctions. Guo Shuqing, the chairperson of the country’s financial sector regulator, said Beijing would “keep normal economic, trade and financial exchanges” with all parties. The US joined the EU and Canada in closing its airspace to Russian planes and saying the justice department aimed to seize yachts, luxury apartments and private jets from wealthy Russians linked to Putin, while German logistics giant DHL on Wednesday joined a long list of multinationals severing ties with Russia, including Exxon Mobil, BP, Shell, Boeing, Ford, Apple and Google, which dropped Russian state news outlets. The sanctions are already causing problems for Russian companies. Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, said on Wednesday it was leaving the European market because its subsidiaries faced large cash outflows. EU diplomats also approved fresh sanctions against Belarus for its supporting role in the invasion, aiming to “hit some economic sectors, and in particular timber, steel and potash”.",News/World news,Ukraine facing humanitarian crisis amid relentless Russian missile attacks,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/ukraine-cities-bombardment-russia-attack-kyiv-kharkiv-russian-war-invasion
3/3/2022,"A senior Conservative MP has accused the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, of being “misleading and defeatist” after he ruled out imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine amid growing pleas from the invaded country. Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, said Britain and its Nato allies should have “more confidence in managing these cold war high-stakes scenarios” and urged Wallace and other ministers to “robustly contest” Russian airstrikes. Ellwood is one of the few senior British politicians to advocate imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which was called for last week by the country’s ambassador to the UK. Wallace said on Wednesday that it risked starting a general war with Russia. Enforcing a no-fly zone would require “British fighter jets shooting down Russian fighter jets”, Wallace said, and if a British or other Nato jet was lost it “would lead to a war against Russia, across the whole of Europe”, with Nato’s members being obliged to join the conflict. “That is not a position that members of Nato are prepared to go,” he told Sky News. Reacting to those remarks, Ellwood said: “It is misleading, simplistic and indeed defeatist to suggest engaging in a no-fly zone over Ukraine would automatically lead to a war, even nuclear conflict with Russia” – although he said he recognised the potential for military escalation was real. He argued it should be possible to face down Russia in the air over Ukraine without starting a wider war. “We should have more confidence in ourselves managing these cold war high-stakes scenarios rather than hesitating only to face up to a bigger battle in the future.” Russian bombing continued in Ukraine on Wednesday, with US officials warning that Vladimir Putin’s regime had stepped up missile and artillery attacks, although so far Moscow’s use of airstrikes and air power in the week-old war has been surprisingly limited. Some of Ukraine’s air force, which was widely expected to be swiftly knocked out, remains airborne, with Kyiv claiming on Wednesday that two of its MiG-29 fighters knocked out two Russian Su-35s, for the loss of one of the MiGs. Most independent commentators agree a no-fly zone is too risky now that Russia has declared war. But Keir Giles, a fellow at Chatham House, said he believed the opportunity had been missed and a no-fly zone could have implemented before the invasion, “possibly even preventing it” because Nato forces would have been “arriving in peaceful skies to keep Russia out”. He added: “Now you would have to fight your way in.” Wallace also said a no-fly zone would stop Ukrainian pilots being able to target Russia from the air, giving an advantage to Moscow, which has stronger ground troops and tanks. “If you had a no-fly zone in Ukraine, the overwhelming scale of the Russian army would be able to drive around with impunity, which it can’t at the moment,” he said. Wallace said a convoy of Russian tanks heading towards Kyiv was moving so slowly because of logistical problems and low morale. However, he said the faltering progress of troops could lead to more aerial bombardment from Russia, and there was a risk that of Putin’s “brutality increasing” as his efforts were stalling. “The Russians are considerably behind their schedule, by days not hours, and that leads to stresses on their logistical supply chains,” he told the BBC. “That’s why you have seen some of these columns fairly grind to a halt. They have also been surprised by the strength of the Ukrainian resistance.” Wallace said Russia would face “years of resistance” if it sought to occupy Ukraine. Russian troops have entered Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, after days of intensive bombardment, but Wallace said Putin’s forces did not yet control it. Support local charities There are several Ukrainian charities working on the ground. Sunflower of Peace is a charity that helps paramedics and doctors, and has been fundraising for supplies, which includes first aid medical tactical backpacks. United Help Ukraine focuses on providing medical supplies and humanitarian aid, and raising awareness of the conflict. Voices of Children aims to help children affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, providing support through art therapy, psychologists, video storytelling and a number of other methods. The British Red Cross has launched an emergency appeal to help Ukraine. The charity will be updating its webpage with news on the work its team is doing, and how support will be used to help people. Support local journalism English-language news outlets based in the country, such as Kyiv Independent and the New Voice of Ukraine, are covering developments on the ground as the conflict unfolds, using local journalists. The Kyiv Independent says it was created by journalists in order to defend editorial independence. This site on Twitter covers many local journalists in Ukraine.

3/3/2022,"About half a million people in NSW are under evacuation orders or warnings as the wild weather system that has battered parts of eastern Australia for a week homes in on the greater Sydney region. Steph Cooke, NSW’s emergency service minister, said the state had 76 evacuation orders in place, affecting 200,000 people with another 18 evacuation orders covering about 300,000. “We have 500,000 people in our state right now, who are either the subject of an evacuation warning or an evacuation,” Cooke said. The evacuation orders cover areas of northern NSW and also parts of the greater Sydney region and the Illawarra. “We will be putting out more warnings and orders as the day goes on,” Carlene York, SES commissioner, told reporters. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued multiple warnings for rivers to flood and for severe weather to affect a region of eastern NSW from near Taree, north of Newcastle down almost to Moruya Heads on the South Coast. Flood warnings were in place for Hawkesbury-Nepean river near Sydney, that had prompted many of the evacuations overnight, but also for Wilsons, Richmond and Clarence rivers in northern NSW where there have been record floods. The heavy rain and potential damaging winds and dangerous surf are the result of an east coast low that was located about 140km east of Newcastle as of 5am local time, Thursday. It was forecast by the bureau to deepen and continue moving towards the Hunter or southern Mid North Coast districts before weakening this evening. Sydney’s forecast is for 100-150mm of rain with the chance of a thunderstorm, possibly severe.“Heavy rainfall which may lead to flash flooding is forecast to develop over parts of the Hunter and Metropolitan, Illawarra and parts of South Coast, Southern Tablelands and Central Tablelands Forecast Districts during Thursday morning before starting to ease from Thursday evening,” the bureau said. “Six-hourly rainfall totals between 80 and 120 mm are likely.”Where thunderstorms form, there is the risk of locally intense rainfall reaching as much as 200mm over six hours, leading to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding, the bureau said. Many schools are closed and the SES is encouraging people in affected areas to avoid all non-essential travel. Rain fall since 9am Wednesday topped 100mm in areas of Sydney’s south, west and north-west, while the CBD collected about 50mm. Warragamba Dam spilling, with the government on Wednesday saying the worst case could see as much as 600 gigalitres a day flow over the wall. During the March 2021 floods, the spill rate got to 440-460GL. pic.twitter.com/vnqiprJlwV Warragamba Dam, Sydney’s main reservoir, began spilling early on Wednesday morning and by Thursday morning it was spilling at the rate of 300 gigalitres. NSW deputy premier Paul Toole said the worst-case scenario was for the dam to spill at 600GL/day rate. That would be well above the 440-460GL/day peak rate during the March 2021 floods. The Warragamba spill will add to other flows coming into the Hawkesbury-Neapean River. At North Richmond, one area being evacuated, the flow is already above major flood levels. @BOM_NSW @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/26TUWigqTl “Major flooding higher than the March 2021 event [is] possible” for the North Richmond, Windsor and towns downstream from Thursday into Friday, the bureau said. The forecast offers little solace for many along the eastern seaboard, with lost more rain predicted for the coming week. And over the next eight days, still lots of rain forecast, including over areas already flood hit. @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/rhAh4i3yMh The SES said they had conducted 47 flood rescue overnight in western and southern Sydney, with most involving motorists who had driven into floodwaters.

Similar big flooding events around the world have tapped in such patterns. “And there is a climate change signal in atmospheric rivers, and that’s been one of the components of this event,” he said.",News/Australia news,"NSW floods: almost 500,000 people across greater Sydney under evacuation orders or warnings",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/nsw-floods-almost-500000-people-across-greater-sydney-under-evacuation-orders
3/3/2022,"The UK-based Russian billionaire oligarchs Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven have had their shares in the $22bn (£17bn) conglomerate LetterOne, which owns Holland & Barrett, “frozen”, days after they were hit with EU sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. LetterOne, which is just under 50% owned by Fridman and Aven, announced on Wednesday night that the men had “ceased to have any involvement with the company” and that it had frozen their shares. Lord Davies, the company’s chair and a former Labour trade minister, told the Guardian: “Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven have ceased to have any involvement with the company. Their shares are frozen and they will not receive dividends, expenses, information or access to the business.” As a result, Davies said, the company was “not controlled by sanctioned individuals”. The billionaires, who have said they will “contest the spurious and unfounded basis” for the imposition of EU sanctions, will not be able to sell their stakes in LetterOne while they remain blacklisted. They will also be barred from entering LetterOne’s offices or speaking to any employees. Fridman and Aven were placed on the EU sanctions list on Monday. They are not under UK or US sanctions. Fridman was described by the EU as “a top Russian financier and enabler of Putin’s inner circle”. Aven was described by the EU as “one of Vladimir Putin’s closest oligarchs”, and an “especially close personal friend” of the Rosneft chief executive, Igor Sechin. “He is one of approximately 50 wealthy Russian businessmen who regularly meet with Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin,” the EU document added. The men have denied any “financial or political relationship with President Putin or the Kremlin” and said they would “contest the spurious and unfounded basis for the imposition of these sanctions – vigorously and through all means available to them.” Fridman, who was listed as the UK’s 11th wealthiest person in the Sunday Times Rich List with an estimated £11bn fortune, owns Athlone House, a £65m mansion in Highgate, north London. Aven, who has an estimated $5.5bn fortune, owns Ingliston House, near Virginia Water, on 8.5 acres of land in a gated estate next to Wentworth golf course. It boasts an art collection including works by Larionov, Goncharova and Kandinsky, as well sculptures by Louise Bourgeois, Henry Moore and Antony Gormley in the garden. The men said the EU sanctions were “malicious and deliberate falsehood”. “Pure and simple, the product of historical fantasies and conspiracy theories dreamed up by private individuals with their own agendas,” their representatives said on Tuesday. “They will fight this injustice with every sinew – for themselves and the tens of thousands of employees in the UK and Europe who rely on them.” LetterOne, which was created by Fridman and partners with proceeds from the sale of TNK-BP after it was bought out by Kremlin energy giant Rosneft, owns a swathe of energy assets across Europe as well as Holland & Barrett and the Spanish supermarket group Dia. Davies said he would work to support the more than 120,000 people who work for LetterOne and his “focus is to strengthen the board to ensure these jobs are protected”.",News/Business,Two UK-based Russian oligarchs have shares in $22bn conglomerate frozen,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/02/two-uk-based-russian-oligarchs-have-shares-in-22bn-conglomerate-frozen
3/3/2022,"Oligarchs under sanctions in the EU and US have been linked to almost £200m of property in London and the home counties, a Guardian analysis has found, as Boris Johnson came under mounting pressure from Labour to step up financial curbs. Among those hit with sanctions by the EU in recent days over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven, who separately own mansions in London and Surrey. Both men stepped down from the board of their private investment group, LetterOne, on Tuesday. Aven attended a business meeting with Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin last week, which his spokesperson said he was required to do. He bought the plot of Ingliston House in Virginia Water in the 2000s for an estimated £8m, and he has spoken of housing a vast art collection there. The property is owned through a company. Fridman bought and still owns Athlone House in north London, paying £65m for the property in 2016, according to the Land Registry. A spokesperson for both men said the justifications for EU sanctions were “simply and demonstrably false” and stressed that the pair were in no way involved in politics, had condemned the war and would contest the allegations. Fridman has previously said he did not know whether he would face sanctions in the UK and hoped it would not happen. Igor Shuvalov, a former Russian deputy prime minister who chairs Russia’s state development bank, is also said to be a London property owner under EU sanctions. He was named in the House of Commons by Labour as owning two flats in Westminster, bought for an estimated £11m. On Wednesday Keir Starmer said the only reason Shuvalov was known to be the real owner of the flats was because it had been revealed by the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. “Transparency is essential to rooting out corruption,” the Labour leader said. “It should be built into our law, but it’s not. And I’m ashamed that we only know about Shuvalov’s Westminster flats because a dissident risked his life. Is the prime minister?” Another billionaire oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, is under sanctions in the US and has previously challenged the restrictions in the courts. He is listed by the US Department of the Treasury as residing at Belgrave Square in London. The property was bought in 2005 for an estimated £25m through Ravellot Ltd, a company based in the British Virgin Islands. A spokesperson for the businessman said the property was “owned by members of Mr Deripaska’s family”. The spokesperson added: “As regards the US sanctions against Mr Deripaska, the grounds on which they were imposed are entirely baseless. No evidence has ever been produced to substantiate allegations of wrongdoing against him. I trust that Mr Deripaska’s position on the importance of peace speaks for itself.” There is more of a mystery surrounding London property previously linked to Alisher Usmanov, who was put under EU sanctions this week and whose sponsorship links to Everton football club were recently frozen. He has for many years been reported as having owned two mansions – one on the same Hampstead road in north London as Fridman and another in Surrey. Usmanov bought the Grade-II listed Beechwood, which is set in 4.5 hectares (11 acres) of ground, for £48m in 2008 through Hanley Ltd, a company based in the Isle of Man. He has also been reported to be the owner of Sutton Place, a 72-room Tudor mansion near Guildford in Surrey that was once frequented by Henry VIII, and was bought for an unknown amount in the mid-2000s. It was marketed for £25m but is thought to have sold for less. However, Usmanov’s spokesperson on Wednesday disputed the information about his property ownership, without being specific about whether he was no longer the beneficial owner of one or both of the properties. Usmanov previously said in response to the EU’s move: “I believe such a decision is unfair and the reasons employed to justify the sanctions are a set of false and defamatory allegations damaging my honour, dignity and business reputation. I will use all legal means to protect my honour and reputation.” Questions have been mounting from British MPs in recent days over why the UK has not matched the US and EU in some of its sanctions. So far, fewer than 10 oligarchs have been sanctioned by the UK in relation to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions have also been brought against Putin and his foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov. A British official rebuffed suggestions that the UK was moving too slowly on imposing further sanctions against individuals close to the Russian president and their business interests. The official pointed to measures such as a ban on all Russian-flagged ships docking in UK ports as an example of how the government was ahead of the EU, US and other G7 nations, but admitted there were “quite significant risks of asset flights” from those fearing they could have their finances frozen. Analysis by the NGO Transparency UK has previously estimated that since 2016 £1.5bn’s worth of UK property has been bought by Russians with alleged links to the Kremlin. Amid a lack of transparency over the beneficial owners of London property, Labour wrote to the government on Wednesday urging it to change proposed legislation to give foreign property owners 28 days rather than 18 months to reveal their identity. The Liberal Democrats called for the government to seize empty property in London owned by oligarchs with links to the Kremlin in order to house Ukrainian refugees. Alistair Carmichael, the party’s home affairs spokesperson, said: “It’s time to freeze these assets and put them to good use, by temporarily housing Ukrainian refugees escaping this terrible war.”",News/World news,Oligarchs under EU and US sanctions linked to £200m in UK property,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/oligarchs-under-eu-and-us-sanctions-linked-to-pounds-200m-uk-property-ukraine-invasion
3/3/2022,"Good morning. Russia’s bombardment of Ukraine’s cities has intensified. In Australia, the floods crisis continues with major warnings in place and evacuation orders in some parts of NSW. And Scott Morrison has drawn criticism from Christian groups over Australia’s refugee intake. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Russia is trying “to erase our history, erase our country, erase us all” after Russian forces intensified missile attacks on residential precincts of multiple major cities. Russia claims to have secured the key southern city of Kherson after another day of relentless shelling, but this has been disputed by the city’s mayor. Both Kyiv and Kharkiv remain under attack, with Russian airborne troops landing in the country’s second-most populous city and engaging in heavy fighting with Ukrainian forces. In New York, the United Nations voted overwhelmingly for a resolution deploring Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, highlighting Russia’s increasing international isolation with 141 of the 193 member states supporting the resolution, 35 abstaining, and five voting against. Only Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea and Syria voted in support of the Kremlin, with historical allies Cuba, Venezuela and China abstaining. Flood-ravaged residents on Australia’s east coast are struggling for breaking news updates after widespread closures of regional media outlets left 33 local government areas without print or digital news coverage. At least 20 News Corp Australia mastheads have disappeared in recent years, with local residents reliant upon Facebook or WhatsApp groups for disaster updates. Meanwhile, the state’s deputy premier and Nationals MP, Paul Toole, has been accused of taking “political potshots” in the middle of a catastrophe for attacking opponents of increased dam walls. Scott Morrison has been heavily criticised for suggesting Ukrainian refugees seeking asylum in Australia would be at “the top of the pile”. The Australian Christian Lobby has condemned the message that the prime minister’s statement would send to people “fleeing the horrors of the Taliban”, and called for the federal government to increase Australia’s humanitarian program intake from its current limit of 13,750 each year. 55,000 Afghan nationals have already lodged “lawful” applications, the Senate has been informed. Meanwhile, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also had a significant impact on Australia’s biggest super fund with Russian-based holdings losing an estimated $137m over the past week. Confidentiality agreements in sexual harassment claim settlements could help perpetrators continue to abuse, Australia’s sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, has told a gathering of industry leaders, warning that the mechanism also often leaves survivors isolated. “Feelings of hopelessness and abandonment” could prompt as many as one-fifth of aged care workers to quit the sector in the next year, a union survey has suggested, with “preventable deaths” during the Covid crisis cited as demotivating staff.

3/3/2022,"A gang of masked thieves have stolen €300,000 (£250,000) worth of equipment from the set of the Netflix heist drama Lupin in France, according to reports. About 20 people broke on to the set after throwing mortar fireworks while the actor Omar Sy, who plays the protagonist, was performing in a scene, according to AFP. The robbery took place in a neighbourhood in Nanterre, on the outskirts of Paris, on 25 February. After a short hiatus, filming for part three of the drama resumed on Monday, Variety reported. Netflix told the website there had been “an incident” during filming of Lupin, adding: “Our cast and crew are safe and there were no injuries.” Authorities are investigating. Sy plays Assane Diop, a character inspired by the infamous gentleman thief and master of disguise Arsène Lupin. The show, produced by the French studio Gaumont, is Netflix’s second biggest international series after Squid Game. Only a few hours after the robbery, Sy was on stage at the César awards in Paris to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the comedy Intouchables, which in 2012 earned him a César prize for best actor. Last month £150,000 worth of props were stolen from the set of another Netflix series, The Crown. Three vehicles were broken into in a lorry park in Mexborough, South Yorkshire, while a unit was shooting nearby. Netflix said it did not affect the production. A spokesperson said after that incident: “We can confirm the antiques have been stolen and we hope that they are found and returned safely. Replacements will be sourced; there is no expectation that filming will be held up.” In October last year a thief mimicking the style of the protagonist in Lupin robbed the bar of a church oratory in northern Italy. The 21-year-old, who was not named, wore a leather jacket similar to the one worn by Diop. He told police he had closely studied the techniques of Diop in preparation for the heist. After entering the bar in Monza, the man stole about €21 from the till and a bottle of fizzy orange. However, he sustained injuries to his arm from smashing through the glass door, and after returning home he called for help. According to reports in the Italian press, the man initially concocted a story of having been attacked and robbed by three people. But he subsequently broke down in tears in front of the police, admitted his guilt and said he had been inspired by Lupin.",News/World news,"Gang steal €300,000 of equipment from Lupin set in Paris",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/gang-steal-300000-of-equipment-from-lupin-set-in-paris
3/3/2022,"The New York police department has released video footage of a suspect who is believed to have assaulted seven Asian women in Manhattan in the span of two hours on Sunday night. According to authorities, the suspect punched, shoved or elbowed the Asian women without provocation. He was described as a man in his 20s with light complexion and blond hair, and was captured on camera wearing a light blue T-shirt, dark pants and a multicolored backpack. The first attack occurred at 6:30pm in midtown Manhattan, where the suspect punched a 57-year-old Asian woman in the face and then fled. The woman suffered swelling to her left cheek and a cut lip, according to authorities.“There was no prior interaction and no statements were made,” police said. Ten minutes after the first attack, the suspect approached a 25-year-old Asian woman near Fifth Avenue and East 30th Street and hit her in the face and the back of the arm. He repeated the same pattern several more times over the next hour, hitting young Asian women – ages 21, 25, 19 and 25 – in the face before shoving one more woman, 20, to the ground near Broadway and East 8th Street and fleeing westward. NYPD’s hate crime taskforce is investigating all seven incidents. The attacks come as Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders face an alarming spike in hate crimes across the city. Earlier this week, the family of GuiYing Ma, an Asian woman who was struck by a man with a rock last fall in Queens, announced she had died after 10 weeks in a coma. Ma is the fourth Asian American in two months to die in New York as a result of violence against members of the AAPI community.

Emergency services discovered the body of Clive Warrington, 67, after being called to reports of a serious assault in Sherborne Place, Cheltenham, at 6.25am on Wednesday. His ex-wife Valerie Warrington was found dead a short time later at an address in the village of Bourton-on-the-Water, about 15 miles from Cheltenham. Police said both victims had stab wounds. A man was arrested near to the scene in Cheltenham and is in custody, Gloucestershire police said. They said the victims and suspect were known to one another and they were not seeking anyone else in connection with the killings. Supt Roddy Gosden told a news conference: “At around 6.25am today, emergency services received a call to Sherborne Place in Cheltenham, with a report of a serious assault. Officers arrived to find a man in his 60s with stab wounds. He was declared dead at the scene by paramedics. “Following concerns for the welfare of a second person, officers visited a property in Whiteshoots Hill in Bourton-on-the-Water. They discovered the body of a woman in her 70s who had also suffered stab wounds.” He added: “Family members have been informed and our thoughts go out to them at this devastating time. They are now receiving support from specially trained officers.” Police cordons are expected to remain in place at a number of locations in the county over the coming days. Investigators are calling on anyone with any information to get in touch, particularly those who may have dashcam or CCTV footage of the two areas. Gosden said: “This has been a challenging situation and we will be providing support to officers and all those who have been impacted by these incidents. Understandably people will be shocked to hear that two lives have been lost in such a tragic way. Over the coming days, officers will be in the local communities to provide reassurance and we would encourage anyone with concerns to speak to us.”",News/UK news,Man arrested in double murder investigation in Gloucestershire,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/02/man-arrested-during-investigation-into-double-in-gloucestershire
3/3/2022,"He is a former Russian deputy prime minister who owns an £11.44m luxury flat in London’s Whitehall, and on Wednesday Igor Shuvalov was accused of being one of Putin’s “cronies” who had “dipped their hands in blood”. The 55-year-old, whose family wealth has been reported to top $200m, has this week been placed under sanctions by the EU, which said that he had supported actions and policies that “undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine”. Now the leader of the opposition has called for him to be blacklisted in the UK as well. Speaking in parliament, Labour leader Keir Starmer described Shuvalov, now head of Russia’s development corporation VEB, as one of the “cronies who prop up [Vladimir Putin’s] regime” and who “dipped their hands in the blood of Putin’s war”. “He is on the EU sanctions list and not on the UK list. When will the prime minister sort this out?” Starmer said. Former lawyer Shuvalov, who was seen as one of Russia’s most senior liberal figures serving in both Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin’s cabinets, stood down from politics to head VEB in 2018. The fluent English speaker remains a highly influential figure. VEB is a key source of funding for the Kremlin’s priority projects, including the Sochi Olympics among others. He also headed the successful organising committee for the 2018 football World Cup bid. Shuvalov’s UK connections have long been a matter of controversy. Russian anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny named Shuvalov as the owner of two luxury apartments in Whitehall Court, an ornate late-Victorian apartment block sandwiched between the Thames and key government buildings including the Ministry of Defence. The building was home to the UK’s Secret Intelligence Service at the time of the first world war. According to an investigation by Navalny’s Fund for the Fight Against Corruption, Shuvalov turned the two flats into a 500 sq metre luxury apartment. The properties, which Shuvalov has said he rented not owned, were bought in 2014 for £11.4m by a company that Navalny’s group linked to Shuvalov. That price is more than 100 times the official £112,000 salary Shuvalov had declared at that time.

3/3/2022,"An attempt by a Kazakh mining giant to sue a British journalist for allegedly claiming it ordered the murders of three men has been thrown out by a judge. HarperCollins, the publisher of Kleptopia: How Dirty Money is Conquering the World, welcomed the victory over what it described as an “egregious case of lawfare” of the type used by wealthy interests to silence journalism. The libel claim had been brought against the Financial Times journalist Tom Burgis by Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC). Its lawyers argued that parts of the book would be understood by an ordinary reader as claiming that the corporation had three men murdered to protect its business interests, or that there was a reasonable ground for suspicion. At the high court on Wednesday, Mr Justice Nicklin dismissed the claim as he ruled that those parts of the book did not refer to the corporation. “Only individuals can carry out acts of murder or poisoning, only individuals can be motivated to do so to protect their business interests,” he said. ENRC, which was publicly listed in London in 2007, was founded in Kazakhstan by three central Asian oligarchs, Alexander Machkevitch, Patokh Chodiev and Alijan Ibragimov. The latter died last year. They were not part of the legal action and challenged any suggestion that there were grounds to suspect them of wrongdoing in connection with alleged corruption or the deaths of three men who were referred to in the case. Two of the dead men – James Bethel and Gerrit Strydom, former ENRC employees – were potential witnesses in an ongoing UK Serious Fraud Office corruption inquiry into ENRC. Their bodies were found in separate motel rooms during a motorbike trip in the US in 2015. Their causes of death were recorded as malaria. The body of the third man, Andre Bekker, was found inside his burned-out Audi in South Africa the following year. Adrienne Page QC, for ENRC, argued that the book gave the impression that ENRC had the three men murdered, adding: “The reader would understand that the murders were carried out at the behest of the claimant in order to protect its dirty secrets.” But lawyers for Burgis and HarperCollins argued that the parts of the book in the claim did not refer to ENRC. Andrew Caldecott QC said: “The question is whether the suspicious nature of the deaths would be linked by the ordinary reader to individuals, rather than a company. If it is only individuals, then the claim fails.” ENRC was ordered to pay £50,000 in legal costs. The result comes as a boost for HarperCollins after it was sued in a separate case relating to the former FT Moscow correspondent Catherine Belton over her book, Putin’s People. Cases brought by several Russian oligarchs, including Roman Abramovich, were settled with apologies and amendments made to the book. Speaking on Wednesday after the ENRC case was dismissed, HarperCollins’ publishing director, Arabella Pike, said England’s legal system made it very hard to publish books of the type written by Burgis and Belton. “We need reform to the law in this country badly,” she said. Burgis connected the case to the war in Ukraine and the renewed focus on the activities of oligarchs from the former USSR. “What is happening in Ukraine is a brutal, bloody new front in a war that has been going on for a long time, and that is the war against democracy waged by kleptocrats, those who rule through corruption, whether it be in central Africa or the former Soviet Union,” he said. A spokesperson for ENRC said: “The allegations made by HarperCollins, Financial Times and Tom Burgis are completely false and continue to cause damage to the company’s reputation. We are considering our options following today’s judgment.”",News/Business,Bid by Kazakh mining company to sue journalist is dismissed by judge,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/02/bid-by-kazakh-mining-company-to-sue-journalist-is-dismissed-by-judge
3/3/2022,"The prime minister’s parliamentary private secretaries were all decked out in blue and yellow. As were Theresa May and several SNP MPs. They could all have come straight from a Ryanair convention. Elsewhere in the chamber, MPs settled for rather more sober blue and yellow ribbons. But the sentiment was exactly the same. This was a House of Commons united in its support for Ukraine. When the Speaker announced that the Ukrainian ambassador, Vadym Prystaiko, was in the gallery, the house rose as one to give him a prolonged and heartfelt standing ovation. It was as moving as it was unprecedented. Though NHS workers might point out that clapping sometimes comes cheap from politicians. Over the last week or so, Boris Johnson has given tough speeches and gone on trips to the European mainland to express solidarity. All of which has played well with a home audience. The Russian invasion has not been a conflict on which it has been difficult to pick sides. Better still, all of his domestic problems seem to have melted away. For the time being at least. While people are dying in a cruel war, it seems almost too trivial to mention that the prime minister couldn’t be bothered to follow his own Covid rules. But at prime minister’s questions the mask began to crack. The Suspect was no longer being asked to just Talk the Talk. He was also being asked to Walk the Walk. And he just couldn’t do it. This isn’t a leader likely to follow the Taiwan president’s example of giving one month of his salary to Ukrainian humanitarian causes. Well, not unless he could get Lord Brownlow to cough up again on his behalf. Dear, dear David. One more time, old chap. Back came the bluster and the shiftiness. The tugging on his Toddlers ’R Us haircut. The childish outbursts of narcissistic rage that he can’t control when challenged. Anything that is not on his terms cannot be tolerated. Come the end of PMQs the new, not entirely convincing, statesmanlike Boris was beginning to look very much like the old, self-centred Boris. Keir Starmer began by reiterating that Labour was united with the government against Russian aggression. Just so there was no room for confusion. He didn’t want Johnson to get the wrong end of the stick. What he really wanted to know was why the UK was lagging so far behind the US and the EU in imposing sanctions on Russian oligarchs. How about Roman Abramovich? He was on a Home Office list as a person of interest and is now in the process of trying to sell Chelsea. Why not go after him before he took the money and ran? “It’s not for me to comment on individual cases,” said the Suspect. Er … hello? Why the hell not? Surely it’s precisely what a prime minister is there for, to talk truth to money. If he can’t then who can? There again, Johnson is on record that he finds it “inexplicable” that oligarchs aren’t doing more – anything – to condemn the war. The rest of us merely find their silence to be entirely on brand. The Labour leader moved on. What about the two Westminster flats of Igor Shuvalov, Vladimir Putin’s former deputy prime minister? We had only got to find out he owned the property through a poisoned Russian dissident. Which brought him on to his next question. Why was the government kicking its heels over the economic crimes bill? It seemed to be going out of its way to make it easier for dirty money to be taken out of the country by giving every kleptocrat an 18-month head start. Johnson had no answer other than to talk about cutting off the Swift payments system and banning Aeroflot. Which was beside the point as no one had any problem with him having done that. “We’re leading Europe,” he mumbled. Except we’re not. At a time when we’re looking for heroes – and who better fits the bill than Volodymyr Zelenskiy? – the UK government looks as if it is running scared. If the Suspect wanted to prove many people’s suspicions that the Tory party is in hock to Russian money, he couldn’t have made a better job of it. At the very least he made it look as if he wasn’t that bothered about London’s status as the world’s laundromat. Or about the extent of Russian influence in British politics. This was a point Labour’s Bill Esterson made when he invited Johnson to donate the £2m the Tories had received from Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of Russia’s former deputy minister of finance, to the Ukrainian war effort. Just to clear the air and to show that the Conservatives had nothing to hide. Now Boris lost his temper. Not all Russian money was dirty money, he shouted. Quite right. Though maybe Chernukhin’s links to the Russian state might have raised some eyebrows. Then, maybe the Suspect believes that every oligarch made their money through hard work or playing the lottery. With all Tories, apart from Bob Seely, steering clear of difficult questions about oligarchs and sanctions, the session drifted to a close with John Penrose wondering what had happened to Brexit. Remember that? Johnson waved his arms and said we’d be seeing some benefits just as soon as Jacob Rees-Mogg got round to identifying any. Just don’t hold your breath. Meanwhile, in the gallery, Prystaiko was anxiously checking his phone. Watching British politicians trade words had a limited appeal when his countrymen were fighting for Ukraine street by street.

3/3/2022,"Angry dockers have vowed not to unload cargoes of Russian oil and gas, as it emerged that shipments were en route to British ports because of an apparent loophole in a government ban and could even be used to heat UK homes. The government imposed a ban on Russian vessels docking in the UK on Tuesday, in response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said that UK ports would refuse access to “all ships with any Russian connection whatsoever”. However, the Department for Transport confirmed the ban did not cover the origin of cargo, including oil and gas that may ultimately have been bought from Russian state-owned entities. On Wednesday, it emerged that at least two ships containing Russian oil and gas were due to dock in the UK. About 180 members of the trade union Unison said they did not want to touch cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) believed to be on the way from Russia. Unison said two LNG tankers, the Fedor Litke and the Boris Vilkitskiy, were on their way with Russian gas, and were due to unload at the Isle of Grain terminal, near London, on Sunday. The ship tracking website MarineTraffic appeared to show the Fedor Litke had turned around, while the Boris Vilkitskiy was sailing south, off the west coast of Norway. Both ships are owned by the Greek firm Dynagas but the owner of the cargoes was not publicly disclosed. The Boris Vilkitskiy is managed by Yamal LNG OAO, a Russian company. A well-placed source told the Guardian that at least one of the ships is carrying LNG purchased by British Gas owner Centrica, which vowed to cut off supply lines from its Russian state-owned partner Gazprom earlier this week. A Centrica spokesperson said it was “also in discussions with the government about how to handle any LNG shipments which are already in transit”. If the LNG were to be loaded at Grain and delivered to Centrica, which owns British Gas, it could end up heating British homes. Unison called on Shapps to expand the ban to prevent the two ships from docking at the Isle of Grain terminal, which is operated by the power networks company National Grid in the Thames estuary. “The workers at the National Grid terminal don’t want to touch the cargo given the tragedy unfolding in Ukraine,” said the union’s Matt Lay. “These staff are determined to show their support for the Ukrainian people and uphold the sanctions imposed against Russia.” On Tuesday, as the law banning Russian ships from British ports was being passed, a third ship, the Pluto, was moored at Milford Haven in south Wales and was scheduled to dock next in Derry. According to MarineTraffic, the 184 metre-long vessel was under way in the Irish Sea on Wednesday evening, with a scheduled arrival time at the city’s docks, known as Foyle Port, of 8pm.

The Guardian understands that Foyle Port expects to receive the vessel and does not believe the ban covers the Pluto. The vessel is bringing crude oil from Primorsk terminal, near St Petersburg, which accounts for 30% of oil exports from the country. Colum Eastwood, the MP for Foyle, said: “This vessel, which contains Russian goods cargo, is not welcome and should not be allowed to make land in Derry. “It runs contrary to the spirit of the sanctions which have been introduced to bring pressure to bear on Putin’s regime to end the outrageous invasion of Ukraine. “The people of Derry stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine who are enduring unimaginable suffering at the hands of Putin’s forces. I have been in touch with the Port to offer assistance through my office to ensure that the spirit of the sanctions are upheld and that the vessel is prevented from docking in Derry.” MarineTraffic data says the Pluto is owned by Tufton Oceanic Ltd, a company based in London but owned via a Cyprus entity. On Monday, Shapps, wrote: “The maritime sector is fundamental to international trade and we must play our part in restricting Russia’s economic interests and holding the Russian government to account. “In these circumstances the Department for Transport does not consider it appropriate for Russian vessels to continue to enter UK ports.” The Pluto is registered with the Marshall Islands and flies the Pacific archipelago’s flag.

3/3/2022,"Russia’s invading forces have bombed civilians in Kyiv, Kharkiv and elsewhere in Ukraine in the past 48 hours, prompting fears of rising casualties and growing questions as to whether the west could step up military, economic or other efforts to help. Here are some of the options – and the risks. After war broke out last week, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, called for the west to implement a no-fly zone over his country, arguing that “people are dying as we speak”, and the idea has captured the imagination of many as the bombing worsens. Creating airspace where Russian aircraft cannot fly would need to be enforced militarily, typically with surveillance, pre-emptive strikes and ultimately by downing banned aircraft. This would mean Nato forces engaging directly with Russian planes. Western leaders have repeatedly said it would not be possible for Nato to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine because, in the words of the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, it would “lead to a war against Russia across the whole of Europe” as western jets would have to seize control of the skies. But Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the defence committee, complained that Wallace should have not ruled the idea out so publicly at least. “This shows we’ve forgotten the rules of post-cold war statecraft by exhibiting weakness and failing to keep the enemy guessing – even if you’ve privately ruled the option out,” the MP said. Boris Johnson, on a visit to Estonia on Tuesday, said the UK, in common with other western nations “will not fight Russian forces in Ukraine”. A doubling of British forces to nearly 2,000 in the Baltic country was “nothing more than defensive measures”, he added. There has been no political will to let Ukraine join Nato, although that has left Kyiv to fend for itself now it is under Russian attack. A more realistic focus, said Prof Malcolm Chalmers from the Rusi thinktank, would be for Nato to “carry on reinforcing its eastern flank”, increasing the size of garrisons from Romania in the south to Estonia in the north. Nato had already said it would deploy “thousands” of troops from its combat-ready response force to the territory of its eastern European members; the US alone had sent a further 12,000 troops. But that will do little to help Kyiv directly. The US and UK supplied anti-tank weapons to Ukraine before fighting started. Once Russia invaded, many more including Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands followed up with anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons. Yet to withstand the Russian onslaught, supplies will need to continue. “The most important thing is to provide weapons the Ukrainians are used to operating – like handheld anti-air systems and lots of anti-tank missiles,” Chalmers said. Ukrainian forces will also need the basics – ammunition and fuel – and open supply lines, meaning logistics inside and outside Ukraine will be critical. But a bolder plan to send Russian-made MiG-29 and Su-25 jets, of the kind familiar to Ukraine’s pilots, from Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria collapsed this week. It is not clear how realistic the proposal was, but if the plan was to revive it, it could provide help to Kyiv’s beleaguered air force. Experts predict, grimly, that although Russia’s advance on Kyiv and other major centres is slow, it is progressing. Mathieu Boulègue, from the Chatham House thinktank, said “unrestricted warfare” was coming with carpet bombing replacing precision strikes and civilian casualties likely to mount. Food is said to be short in the east of Ukraine, while aid is backed up on the Polish border, taking 48 hours to get through. “Broadly, the neighbours of Ukraine have to prepare for a humanitarian disaster,” said Keir Giles, from Chatham House, adding that the situation required major donor efforts from governments and individuals.

Earlier on Wednesday, Johnson announced in the Commons that a Disasters Emergency Committee public appeal for aid for Ukraine had been launched, with the British government pledging to match the first £20m in donations. The biggest step the west could take to hurt Russia’s economy is considered to be the blocking of energy exports. So far this has been resisted because of the damage it would cause for European nations reliant on the gas supply. As much as $700m (£525m) of oil, gas and other commodities is thought to be bought by the UK, US and EU each day, powering the Russian economy and aiding the Kremlin. Russia accounts for almost 40% of the EU’s natural gas imports, with up to 65% in Germany and 100% in some eastern European nations. But there are options to replace Russian gas, including sourcing more supplies of liquid natural gas from other nations such as Qatar. There could also be increased use of coal power, as well as Germany delaying planned closures of its three remaining nuclear reactors. Sanctions on Russian banks and the country’s central bank are having the biggest impact on its economy. In an early sign of the damage, the Moscow stock exchange remains closed while the rouble plunged almost 30% on Monday after steps to freeze reserves held overseas by the Russian central bank. Measures to exclude more Russian banks from the Swift international payments network are still being drawn up. But there are fears that casting the net too wide could have a knock-on impact for the global financial system, which has never seen a crisis like this. Boris Johnson has announced new anti-corruption measures, including the imposition of sanctions on Russian oligarchs. But implementation has been slow and only nine individuals have been targeted by the UK so far, with the EU putting sanctions on far more. The idea is that imposing financial pain on the Russian elite, who are seen as enabling Vladimir Putin’s regime and whose wealth is spread around the world in properties and business investments, will in turn apply pressure to the president himself. There have been calls for a faster and a wider net to be drawn. Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP, urged the UK government to target 105 more oligarchs. “We are complicit in this and we are facilitating it by not tackling this,” she said.",News/World news,What more could the west do about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/what-more-could-the-west-do-about-russias-invasion-of-ukraine
3/3/2022,"At the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a week ago, almost every analyst agreed that Russian oil and gas would keep flowing westwards. The state of mutual energy dependence seemed too entrenched. On one side, the EU could not decouple itself easily from the source of 38% of its natural gas imports. On the other, Russia under financial sanctions would need cash. Old hands reflected that, even in the long decades of the cold war, the Soviet Union and Europe maintained commercial relationships in energy. A week later, such thinking looks naive. The “shock and awe” financial sanctions, especially those aimed at Russia’s central bank, exceed anything previously seen, but the shortcoming is obvious: if you really want to hit the Russian economy hard, the place to aim is its energy export sector, a part that has been spared sanctions so far and generates hundreds of millions of dollars daily. The point is made repeatedly by Ukrainian officials in their appeals for the trade to cease, and its moral force is hammered home with every fresh Russian atrocity. The White House said on Wednesday it is “very open” to the idea of energy sanctions on Russia. One might say cynically that it is easier to air such sentiments from Washington than Europe, but even German ministers are publicly taking about what would happen if Russia halted gas supplies suddenly. “We are prepared for that. I can give the all-clear for the current winter and summer,” said Robert Habeck, economy minister. Nuclear power stations, currently set for imminent closure, could be kept switched on and coal-fired stations could be used as back-up, he argued. If that’s really the case, the obvious question is why the west shouldn’t just get on with imposing a few energy sanctions – even if only caps on imports initially – and accept the financial pain. There is a foretaste already amid the various “self-sanctioning” measures taken by European refineries to avoid buying Russian oil and by European gas suppliers (including Centrica) to disentangle themselves from Gazprom. The price of a barrel of Brent hit $113 on Wednesday, the highest for seven years. UK natural gas prices returned to last autumn’s sky-high levels and pump prices are setting records. Prices would probably go even higher if full-blown energy sanctions were imposed, but what about security of supply? Here’s Brussels thinktank Bruegel: “If the EU is forced or willing to bear the cost, it should be possible to replace Russian gas already for next winter without economic activity being devastated, people freezing, or electricity supply being disrupted.” It also, it should be said, described the challenge as “momentous”, said rules would have to be rewritten and concluded “exceptional measures” may be needed to reduce demand. But the shorthand version seems to be: yes, if you are prepared to accept the costs, it’s doable. That, one suspects, is where the sanctions debate is rapidly heading. It should probably have been there from the off. Aviva’s plan to return £4.75bn to shareholders didn’t quite reach the target of £5bn set by activist investor Cevian Capital, but the sum should be enough. The £250m gap can be mentally covered by Aviva’s accompanying £385m purchase of UK financial adviser firm Succession Wealth. Even activists tend not to object to conventional bolt-on acquisitions. The missing bit in the script is a higher share price. At 410p, Aviva stands roughly where it was three years ago, before chief executive Amanda Blanc got to work with a series of major overseas disposals and a heavy cost-cutting programme. It’s a slightly odd position. The fresh element of the return of capital represents a quarter of Aviva’s stock market value and Blanc’s dividend promise of 33p for 2023 represents a fat yield in the offing, which ought to get the attention of income investors. Put it down to a lack of faith in the idea that Aviva can really emerge as a reliable generator of cash. That’s hardly the fault of Blanc, who has done everything she promised and has now set a few financial targets to be judged on. But, yes, after 20 years of disappointments for shareholders, the idea that Aviva might be fixed may take a while to become truly believable.",News/World news,"If you want to hit Russian economy hard, aim for energy export",https://www.theguardian.com/world/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/02/if-you-want-to-hit-russian-economy-hard-aim-for-energy-export
3/3/2022,"The brutal impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine was laid bare on Wednesday, as reports emerged that a Ukrainian police officer had lost his entire family while others including a Ukrainian TV cameraman and an Israeli DJ were cited as among other victims. Ukrainian media reported that a family of five had been killed while trying to flee from Kherson, as Russian troops entered the city. Those killed were the wife, parents, daughter and baby son of Ukrainian police officer Oleg Fedko, according to Ukrainian news outlet Zaxid. It reported that the family were trying to escape the incoming troops in two cars when they were attacked near Nova Kakhovka on the outskirts of Kherson. The officer’s wife, Irina, six-year-old daughter, Sofia, and baby son, Ivan, along with his father, Oleg, and mother, Anna, were all killed, it said. The officer’s brother Denis Fedko told the news outlet that he was talking on the phone to his mother when she started shouting that there were children in the car. Then he heard shots ring out. The attack is understood to have happened last Thursday. The older couple reportedly died at the scene. The children were taken to hospital, but died despite attempts to save their lives. Meanhile, a TV cameraman who was among the first victims of Tuesday’s attack on Kyiv TV tower has been identified as Yevhenii Sakun.

Israeli DJ Roman Brodsky, a father of two, was shot dead in his vehicle at a checkpoint outside Kyiv, while attempting to leave Ukraine and return to Israel, the Times of Israel reported. The Foreign Ministry said Brodsky was part of a convoy of vehicles travelling to the Moldovan border to leave the country. He and his partner were intending to then fly to Israel.

3/3/2022,"The Australian economy at the end of 2021 rebounded for one reason alone – people coming out of lockdowns in the late winter and spring period spent their money. But ironically this massive surge of growth from households comes at a time when workers are receiving a smaller share of the economy than ever before. During the global financial crisis, then Treasury secretary Ken Henry famously advised the Rudd government that the best way to drive the recovery was “go early, go hard, go households”. The reason being that household spending makes up just over half of Australia’s economy and if people are spending money, then the economy will do well. The latest GDP figures for the December quarter of last year are not a case of government stimulus to households powering growth, but instead one where household spending delivered a major boon to the economy because people in New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT were able to come out of lockdown and once again spend money. In the December quarter, Australia’s economy grew by an equal record 3.4%. But don’t get too excited about the record – it only occurred because in the September quarter last year the economy shrank by the third-biggest amount ever: If the graph does not display please click here And essentially all of this record growth came from household spending: If the graph does not display please click here The other biggest generator of growth besides our spending was that of the “change in inventories” which occurred because businesses built up their inventories (in order to makes things for and sell things to households). And what did we increase our spending on? Overwhelming nonnecessities – recreation and culture, clothing and eating out: If the graph does not display please click here But this is decidedly a case where just looking at one quarter hides how big the damage of the pandemic has been. Despite the strong pick-up, household spending in cafes, restaurants and the like in the last three months of 2021 was still 14% below that in the same period in 2019. The use of transport services meanwhile remains 74% below the pre-Covid period: If the graph does not display please click here The boost in the economy also did not come from across the nation – it really was just driven by NSW, Victoria and the ACT. These states and territory had been in lockdown in the September quarter, and so, not surprisingly, saw a massive jump in activity after the restrictions were removed: If the graph does not display please click here These rather absurd quarterly growth figures mean focusing on three-month periods can exaggerate for good or ill what is going on. If we instead look at the amount of economic activity over the course of 12 months, we are able to see much more clearly the impact of the pandemic and our recovery: If the graph does not display please click here In the first three months of last year, Australia’s annual activity was some 4.6% below the median-term trend. Essentially our economy was $95bn smaller than expected. Now we are 2.1% behind the trend pace, suggesting that, all going well, by the end of this year we should be back to where we were expected to be prior to the pandemic. That would be an astonishing recovery, but one thing that currently is not assisting things is government support. The end of the homebuilder program after the initial hit from the instant-asset write-off saw dwelling construction and investment in machinery and equipment decline in the last quarter of 2021: If the graph does not display please click here While the instant-asset write-off did produce a big jump in the investment in machinery and equipment, the reality is there are only so many utes and tools small businesses can buy. That hit last year may now be followed by an ongoing slump in such investment. What we also can see is that the government spending and investment is no longer providing stimulus to the economy: If the graph does not display please click here Government spending was essentially flat, while public investment fell. The problem is so too did private sector investment. Given government stimulus bolstered our economy during the pandemic, its withdrawal now will inevitably hinder the economy. That would be fine if the private sector was ready to take over, but at this stage it appears not. One thing businesses can’t blame is labour costs. In the last three months of 2021, real non-farm labour costs fell 0.2% and they are now 3% below what they were prior to the pandemic. If the graph does not display please click here This mean that as we now pass through the end of the pandemic lockdowns we find that the share of the economic pie going to workers is smaller than ever. In the December quarter just 46% of GDP went to the compensation of employees – 1.5 percentage points lower than it was two years earlier and lower than at any time in recorded history. Households are driving economic growth, but workers are not getting their fair share of rewards.",News/Business,Don’t get too excited by Australia’s rebounding economy – it's a distorted snapshot of the true picture | Greg Jericho,https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2022/mar/03/dont-get-too-excited-by-australias-rebounding-economy-its-a-distorted-snapshot-of-the-true-picture
3/3/2022,"Ukrainians do not want to flee. They do not want to pack their lives into a suitcase. They do not want to crowd aboard packed trains that carry them away from their homes, or trudge for days with their children. They do not want to leave behind husbands and sons and parents. They do not want to begin again in a foreign country where they have nothing, far from those they love. They go because they are under attack. They go because missiles are falling. They go because their sisters call to say that Russian soldiers have entered their towns. They go because they see what Vladimir Putin’s war machine is already doing in Ukraine, and because they know what it has done before. They go because if they do not go now, tomorrow may be too late. They go because they must. Despite the bravery and resolve of Ukrainians, the reality of what is happening and the enormity of the approaching horror is coming home. “They all have orders to erase our history, erase our country, erase us all,” the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Wednesday. Russia claimed to have taken the city of Kherson, though local authorities disputed that, and airborne troops have landed near the centre of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city. The mayor of Mariupol said the wounded could not be evacuated because of heavy shelling. Konotop’s mayor told residents that the invaders had given them an ultimatum: “If we start resisting, they’ll wipe out the town using artillery.” (The crowd appears to have backed resistance nonetheless.) This is a war so calamitous that 141 countries voted to denounce it at the UN general assembly – where the only nations siding with Russia were Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea and Syria. In less than one week following the invasion, at least 660,000 people fled Ukraine. Many more are trying to do so. The UN refugee agency warns that 4 million could leave the country. Poland is not even requiring passports from arrivals. The EU plans to grant temporary protection, including a residence permit and access to employment and social welfare, for up to three years. Countries long hostile to refugees have made an exception for their neighbours. (“It’s different in Ukraine than in countries like Afghanistan,” was the bald explanation from Austria’s chancellor, Karl Nehammer.) The British response, in contrast, has been callous and grudging. Under growing pressure, the government now plans to allow a further 100,000 relatives of Ukrainian nationals to enter, and to create a new visa sponsorship route allowing businesses to bring Ukrainians here. The prime minister had the gall to describe the arrangements as “already … very generous indeed”. That he could even claim it to be so reflects the inhumanity of his government’s broader policies. The Home Office boast of a “bespoke” sponsor route means, as immigration barrister Colin Yeo points out, a rejection of the existing international framework for the protection of refugees. When politically expedient, the government creates exemptions for those it deems worthy while seeking new ways to shut others out. Even as it claims benevolence towards Ukrainians, it tries to criminalise seeking asylum through an irregular route via its nationality and borders bill, while closing down safe alternatives. Only rejection by the Lords this week has stood in its way. The UK should extend its hand not because those in need are Ukrainian, but because of the scale of the tragedy that is befalling them.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Ukraine’s desperation: escaping Putin’s cruelty | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/the-guardian-view-on-ukraines-refugees
3/3/2022,"Joe Biden hit the road to put his domestic agenda back in the spotlight on Wednesday following a state of the union address that assailed the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and drew mixed reviews. The US president travelled to the battleground state of Wisconsin to highlight his bipartisan infrastructure law but faced questions from reporters about Ukraine as he departed the White House. Asked if President Volodymyr Zelenskiy should leave the country or stay put, Biden said: “I think it’s his judgment to make and we’re doing everything we can.” Questioned whether he is considering banning Russian oil imports, he replied: “Nothing is off the table.” The uneasy balancing act between domestic and foreign priorities was reflected in his first State of the Union address on Tuesday night. Ukraine was inevitably the opening topic, drawing rare bipartisan support, but ultimately made up less than a fifth of Biden’s remarks. At the heart of the the 62-minute primetime speech were the economy, voting rights, the coronavirus pandemic and the president’s ailing social spending and climate agenda, drawing criticism from Republicans. Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia welcomed Biden’s plan to ban Russian flights from US airspace and reinforce Nato partnerships but added: “The president immediately followed this by going through his laundry list of partisan priorities. “The Biden administration’s policies have led to record inflation, an ongoing crisis at the southern border, a disastrous and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan, skyrocketing gas, energy, and grocery costs, and increased instability abroad.” Few presidents in American history have had so many urgent national and international crises bearing down on them so early in their first term in office, and few have faced a nation so divided on multiple issues. Less than half of Americans approve of Biden, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. The national opinion poll, conducted from 28 February to 1 March, found that 43% of adults approve of Biden’s performance in office while 54% disapprove and the rest were not sure. Against this inauspicious backdrop, his state of the union addressed gained a symbolic boost as members of Congress did not wear face masks because of falling Covid case rates (although five members had tested positive before the speech). History was made as two women – Vice-President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi – sat behind the president. But a speech normally aimed at an American audience also had to speak to an anxious global audience in what one senator, Marco Rubio, has described as “the most dangerous moment in 60 years” given Putin’s potential humiliation and nuclear capability. Biden, who has framed his presidency around a defining struggle between democracies and autocracies, sought to rally allies, stating: “Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and totally unprovoked. He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy.“He thought the west and Nato wouldn’t respond. He thought he could divide us at home, in this chamber, in this nation. He thought he could divide us in Europe as well. But Putin was wrong. We are ready. We are united. And that’s what we did: we stayed united.” He vowed: “When the history of this era is written, Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.” Biden earned more applause from both Democrats and Republicans by warning Russian oligarchs that a new task force would help “find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets. We’re coming for your ill-begotten gains.” He also outlined the sanctions that have isolated Putin with remarkable speed and, in an ad lib not in his prepared remarks, warned: “He has no idea what’s coming.” Among the most emotional moments of the night was a standing ovation or Ukrainian ambassador Oksana Markarova sitting in the gallery. Some members of both parties wore yellow and blue outfits, pinned ribbons to their lapels or held miniature flags to show their support for Ukraine. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, said in a speech on Wednesday: “When the president called on the chamber to stand up and applaud Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador, the feeling in the room reminded me of the unity we all felt after 9/11.” On Wednesday, a member of the Ukrainian parliament Oleksandra Ustinova described the speech as a “total disappointment”, saying without the enforcement of a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which the US said it would not help to enforce, “people will literally die”. During the address, Biden no made mention of last year’s military withdrawal from Afghanistan, a move that ended America’s longest war but descended into chaos and rattled allies. At one point in the address, Biden made reference to troops in Afghanistan and Iraq breathing in toxic smoke from burn pits returning in flag-draped coffins. Lauren Boebert, a far right Republican congresswoman, heckled: “You put them in: 13 of them!” – a reference to 13 service personnel killed during the Afghan evacuation. Later Kim Reynolds, the governor of Iowa, giving the official Republican response to the state of the union address, said he had failed to make America respected around the world again. “The disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal did more than cost American lives; it betrayed our allies and emboldened our enemies.” The bipartisan comity also unravelled as soon as Biden’s devoted the lion’s share of his speech to domestic concerns. He pointed to progress against the pandemic since last year, with a dramatic reduction in cases, readily available vaccines and tests, and new therapeutics soon becoming more accessible. “Tonight, I can say we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines. It’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again. Let’s use this moment to reset.” But he did not use the words “Build Back Better”, the name of his stalled legislative agenda, instead talking about “building a better America”. He insisted he would confront inflation, promising that he has a “better plan” to reduce cost increases than Republicans. Biden repeated his call to pass voting rights legislation but, a year after his first speech to a joint session of Congress surprised many with its progressive ambitions, tried to push Democrats towards centre ground by rejecting calls to “defund the police” and pledging: “We need to secure the border and fix the immigration system.” Republicans, however, made clear that unity remains the exception, not the norm, and suggested that address will do little to change political dynamics ahead of November’s midterm elections. Senator John Cornyn of Texas told the Hugh Hewitt Show: “It was not a great speech, and I think, unfortunately, it was a rehash of a lot of his failed domestic policies … He really didn’t offer any solutions. I’m afraid that he realises this is going to be a disastrous midterm election, and he just doesn’t know how to turn the ship around.”",News/US news,Biden bids to talk up ailing agenda after State of the Union draws mixed reviews,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/02/joe-biden-state-of-the-union-russia-putin
3/3/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s aggression against Ukraine is not limited to territorial objectives. The target is Ukrainian nationhood itself – a warped dimension to the Russian president’s thinking that was underestimated by many western analysts in the buildup to war. Mr Putin’s enthusiasm for ultranationalist historiography and quasi-religious ideas of Slavic identity was already known. But the extent to which those doctrines informed his policy was not widely enough appreciated before the televised address last month in which he claimed (wrongly) that modern Ukraine was an invention of the Bolsheviks, and denied the country’s right to statehood. He sees post-Soviet borders as injuries on the body of a greater Russian motherland that must be avenged. It is the language not just of authoritarian menace but tyrannical derangement. If any hope can be salvaged from the Russian president’s estrangement from reality, it is that he might also lose touch with his own people and alienate the soldiers and civilian cronies who take his orders. Opposition polling currently suggests majority support for the “special operation” in Ukraine, although there is a divide between generations. Among Russians under the age of 30, support and opposition are more evenly split. That is before the effect of sanctions has been felt. The cost could have differential impacts. Some will see it through Mr Putin’s lens – as proof of western aggression. But a generation that has grown up enjoying fluid contacts with Europe might find cultural isolation and economic autarky hard to tolerate. There are signs that the Kremlin is not confident of keeping public opinion onside by the usual propaganda methods. What little independent media has hitherto been tolerated is being silenced. Gestures of solidarity with Ukraine are being criminalised. Accounts of schoolchildren and their parents detained in police cells after laying flowers at the Ukrainian embassy suggest escalation to totalitarian levels of repression. Under these circumstances, demonstrations against the war are acts of tremendous courage. The many Russians who are outraged and ashamed at what is being done in their name count also among the victims of Putinism. Another variable is the disillusionment of Russian soldiers in Ukraine, distressed and disoriented, discovering that the story they were told – of a grateful captive people eager for liberation – was a cruel lie. Their falling morale and the anger of their parents back home did not feature in Mr Putin’s calculations. Disagreement within the regime itself will be much harder to detect. The Kremlin power structures combine neo-Soviet statecraft and oligarchic gangster capitalism. The balance of power has shifted over years from private sector bandits to their security service protectors, but it is all part of the same kleptocracy. If the money stops flowing, Mr Putin’s ideological fantasies will not compensate those who find themselves out of pocket. That makes the internal situation more brittle and volatile than it perhaps looks from the outside. But the self-interest of lesser thugs who might think their boss has gone too far is not a dependable source of restraint. The Putin regime, for all its rhetoric of national revival, does not represent the interests of anyone beyond the circle that is enriched and empowered by its vicious methods. In targeting Ukrainian nationhood, Mr Putin wages war also against the better Russia that cannot express itself as long as he is in power.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Russian dissent: a slide to totalitarianism | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/the-guardian-view-on-russian-dissent-a-slide-to-totalitarianism
3/3/2022,"The west has severed trading relationships with Vladimir Putin’s Russia on a scale thought unimaginable only a week ago. As tanks edge towards Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, governments around the world have taken coordinated action, using sanctions to target Russia’s banking system, state-controlled companies and powerful oligarchs. Under self-imposed restrictions, companies in Europe and the US have followed suit, with energy firms severing corporate ties and brands refusing to export their consumer goods. Here are the actions taken so far: The day after Russia invaded Ukraine, excluding Russian banks from Swift was described by one EU minister as a “very last resort”. Now it is happening: under EU sanctions, seven Russian banks, including VTB, the second-largest, will be excluded from Belgian-based Swift, the bank messaging system that underpins global trade. Being locked out of the world’s dominant bank messaging system means Russia will have to resort to more cumbersome alternatives, possibly fax machines, although Russia’s central bank says it has a domestic equivalent. Sberbank and Gazprombank, Russia’s largest and third-largest lenders, which are used for oil and gas payments, were not cut off from Swift. These banks, however, have been under sanctions limiting their access to EU capital markets since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. In another unprecedented strike against a G20 economy, Brussels, Washington and London have banned Russia’s central bank from accessing foreign currency reserves – a devastating move when a sizeable chunk of its $640bn war chest is held in dollars, euros and sterling. This will make it much harder for Russia’s central bank to prop up the rouble, which crashed to a record low on Monday, threatening rampant inflation and a crisis in living standards for ordinary Russians. The UK government has blacklisted a handful of business people already subject to US sanctions and claims to be preparing a “hitlist” of oligarchs with links to Putin, but has taken no action so far. However, Boris Johnson has backed the formation of a property register that would identify Russian oligarchs, a move that the Labour MP Chris Bryant said prompted Chelsea owner and Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich to begin selling his £200m portfolio of homes. Officials in Brussels have already moved to ban prominent individuals from travelling to and from the EU and frozen the assets they hold in the region, along with 53 businesses and organisations connected to the Russian state. Alexei Mordashov, who owns a third of the London-listed tour operator Tui – Europe’s biggest – is on the EU list. Igor Sechin, 61, the chief executive of Rosneft, the state oil company and one of the world’s largest crude oil producers, is another in the EU’s sights. Sergei Roldugin, 71, the former principal cellist of the Kirov Opera Theatre’s orchestra in the 1980s and godfather to Putin’s eldest daughter, Maria, is also among those it is claimed are threatening the territorial integrity of Ukraine. At least 30 countries have banned Russian planes from their airspace, deepening Russia’s isolation from the world. The US became the latest to announce a prohibition of all Russian passenger, cargo and charter flights, joining Canada, the EU and the UK. Moscow has responded with tit-for-tat bans that end the busy flow of traffic in the skies. Before the ban, 300 flights a day left Russia to land or fly over the EU, while EU carriers landed 50 planes and flew 90 over the world’s biggest country by land area. In a move targeting oligarchs, Russian nationals will not be able to charter planes to fly into the EU or use private jets in the UK. The move will also impose costs on western planes bound for Asia that will be obliged to make costly and time-consuming detours around Siberia. EU officials estimate an extra four hours could be added to a flight from northern Europe to an Asian destination. Western governments are also considering further bans on marine traffic after the UK became the first to announce it would stop ships and yachts “with any Russian connection” docking at its ports. The European parliament has urged the EU to enact this policy and officials think it is likely to be adopted. Apple said it was pausing sales in Russia while Nike prevented Russian customers from buying online, joining a growing list of companies to distance themselves from the country in response to its invasion of Ukraine. Nike confirmed it was switching off web sales in Russia, although the brand said on its Russian website that shoppers could visit local Nike stores, of which there are several in Moscow, St Petersburg and other cities. Meta, which owns Facebook, said posts from Russian state media are no longer being recommended to users by Facebook’s algorithm, with Instagram to soon follow suit, according to the tech news website, The Verge. This development comes after the company said it restricted access to Russian state media accounts in Ukraine, blocked Russian state media from running ads on the platform and said it took down posts related to a disinformation campaign targeting Ukraine. The carmaker Ford suspended its commercial van joint venture in Russia “until further notice”. It is among several automakers, including rival General Motors, Jaguar Land Rover and Renault, to halt sales and operations in Russia in the last few days. Adidas, Europe’s largest sportswear manufacturer, suspended its partnership with the Russian Football Union, while The Walt Disney Company, which owns Marvel Studios, 20th Century Studios and Pixar, said it was pausing its release of films in Russia, including its anticipated Pixar film Turning Red, “given the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and the tragic humanitarian crisis”. A spokesperson for Netflix told The Wall Street Journal that “given the current situation” the streaming service has no plans to distribute news, sports and entertainment channels from Russian state media, despite a new Russian regulation that requires organisations with more than 100,000 subscribers to carry them, according to a source familiar with the matter. The British online clothing retailer Asos suspended sales on Wednesday, saying trading in Russia was no longer “practical nor right”. Russia accounted for 4% of the group’s sales and contributed about £20m to profits last year. Airbnb said it will provide free, short-term housing for 100,000 refugees who have fled Ukraine, which will be paid for by the company and through donations. In the same vein, the online marketplace Etsy said it was cancelling all balances owed to the company by sellers in Ukraine, including listing and advertising fees, amounting to roughly $4m (£3m), to alleviate financial hardships felt by those in the country. Russia’s largest foreign investor, BP, led the way with its surprising announcement on Sunday that it would exit its 20% stake in state-controlled Rosneft, a move that could result in a $25bn write-off and cut its global oil and gas production by a third.Shell will end its joint ventures with Russian state energy firm Gazprom, which are worth about $3bn and were poised to generate huge profits for the company over the next 30 years. The planned sales include its 27.5% stake in the Sakhalin-II liquefied natural gas facility, its 50% stake in the Salym Petroleum Development and the Gydan energy venture. Shell will also end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, in which it holds a 10% stake worth $1bn. Nord Stream 2 was halted by the German government after the invasion of Ukraine. ExxonMobil, the US oil major, operates the Sakhalin-1 project on behalf of a consortium of Japanese, Indian and Russian companies. It said: “We are beginning the process to discontinue operations and developing steps to exit the Sakhalin-1 venture,” though it added that environmental and safety concerns meant this may take some time to complete.",News/World news,Sanctions and boycotts: how the west has responded to the invasion of Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/sanctions-boycotts-west-response-russian-invasion-ukraine
3/3/2022,"Britain’s leading business groups are at loggerheads with the government over their call to drop the use of the word “chairman”, arguing the term is archaic and needs updating. In a battle over the use of gendered language, bosses representing thousands of firms across the country said ministers should bring forward legislation to use the neutral term “chair” in the UK’s official corporate register – the home of company documents. In an open letter to the government asking for the change, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), Make UK, the Institute of Directors and the Confederation of British Industry said “chairman” was still used by Companies House as its default term for the model articles of association for new firms, meaning it was then repeated in the documents for thousands of businesses. The letter said enforcing a gender-neutral term could be easily incorporated into upcoming corporate governance legislation. Sarah Howard, the chair of the BCC, said: “It’s a small but very significant alteration that will help break down subconscious bias and send a clear message to future generations that they have an equal role to play in running businesses, whatever their gender identity. “There is much more that all of us need to do to help address inequality in the business world and this change would send a clear message on government intent.” Despite the push, it is thought that the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has so far dismissed the request in private meetings. Officials said companies currently have the flexibility to craft their own articles of association, while updating the rules would require ministers to bring forward new legislation. A source close to Kwarteng said the decision was not linked to culture wars and instead was about prioritising parliamentary time. “There is the coronavirus pandemic and the worst war on European soil for 70 years, so understandably there are pressures on parliamentary time,” they said. All the signatories of the letter said they would take steps to amend their own articles to use the word “chair” and would encourage other businesses to follow suit. Dame Judith Hackitt, chair of Make UK, said she hoped the government would support the “small, but positive and highly symbolic” move. “This is a welcome and long overdue change, which is easy to make and which I hope all businesses across the UK will support. Despite progress in recent years, it remains the case that women are underrepresented in the most senior roles across companies.” According to the FTSE Women Leaders Review for 2022, as few as 8% of chief executives in the FTSE 100 are women and they represent as few as 13.7% of executive directorships. Research from the World Bank has also suggested a direct link between the use of gendered language and differing employment rates between men and women. A government spokesperson said: “We wholeheartedly support increasing the diversity of business leaders and championing women in business. “Companies already have the flexibility to craft their own articles and to amend their articles as they see fit.”",News/Politics,UK businesses call on government to drop gendered term ‘chairman’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/02/uk-business-groups-call-government-drop-gendered-term-chairman
3/3/2022,"The latest public blow to under-fire Phil Mickelson was delivered before an unforeseen boost when Rory McIlroy called for clemency towards the six-time major champion. In December, Mickelson claimed he won the PGA Tour’s inaugural player impact program which rewards those who bring attention to the sport. It has now emerged Tiger Woods actually took the $8m top prize despite not hitting a shot in competition during 2021. “How is this possible?” asked Tour professional Kevin Na. Mickelson was second, which carries a $6m payout. Woods could not resist a social media jibe at his old adversary as the results were published. Five criteria – internet searches, earned media, social media, TV sponsor exposure and public awareness – were used to determine a top 10. Mickelson is taking a break from golf and has lost sponsors after being engulfed in a scandal related to his comments about a Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway tour. McIlroy initially branded Mickelson’s words “naive, egotistical, selfish, ignorant.” Speaking before the Arnold Palmer Invitational, McIlroy said Mickelson should be afforded some leeway. “It is unfortunate,” said McIlroy of Mickelson’s situation. “I think Phil has been a wonderful ambassador for the game of golf, still is a wonderful ambassador for the game of golf. “Look, Phil will be back. I think the players want to see him back. He’s done such a wonderful job for the game of golf and he’s represented the game very, very well for the entirety of his career. “We all make mistakes. We all say things we want to take back. No one is different in that regard. But we should be allowed to make mistakes. We should be allowed to ask for forgiveness and for people to forgive us and move on. Hopefully, he comes back at some stage, he will be, people will welcome him back and be glad that he is back.” McIlroy finished third in the impact programme earning him $3.5m. Unlike Na, he has no problem with Woods’ position. “You look at the 10 guys that are on there, and they’re the 10 guys that have been at the top of the game or have been around the top of the game for a long time,” said McIlroy. “Obviously, everyone’s seen the five metrics that go into it and how everyone ranked in those metrics. I feel like it’s a pretty self-explanatory system. That’s how the numbers rolled out. It’s certainly not something that I’m checking up on every week to see where I’m at but I think it went the way most of us expected it to go.” McIlroy will have Adam Scott and Sepp Straka for company over rounds one and two at Bay Hill. “This is a course that has fitted my eye from the first time I played here,” said McIlroy, who won here in 2018.

3/3/2022,"Netflix has paused all future Russian projects and acquisitions as a result of the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. According to Variety, the streamer is “assessing the impact of current events”, which has led to four Russian original series being indefinitely paused. Zato, a crime series set after the fall of the Soviet Union, directed by the Belarus-born director Darya Zhuk, was already in production but has now been put on hold. Netflix also has another three series in the pipeline in Russia, including Anna K, based on Anna Karenina. The service launched in the country just over a year ago and is believed to have about 1 million subscribers. Earlier this week, the company confirmed it would refuse to broadcast Russian state propaganda, in the face of a law that just came into effect. It requires streaming services with more than 100,000 daily users to carry 20 major Russian federal television channels, many of which broadcast Kremlin propaganda. The past few days have seen an increasing pushback from Hollywood against Russia, including Disney, Warner Bros, Paramount, Sony and Universal all delaying their upcoming film releases. Titles affected include Turning Red, The Batman, Morbius and Sonic the Hedgehog 2. “We will make future business decisions based on the evolving situation,” a Disney spokesperson said in a statement. “In the meantime, given the scale of the emerging refugee crisis, we are working with our NGO partners to provide urgent aid and other humanitarian assistance to refugees.” The Cannes film festival has stated that no Russian delegations or attendees with ties to the government will be welcomed in May.

3/3/2022,"Roman Abramovich has bowed to growing pressure to call time on his ownership at Chelsea by confirming the club are up for sale. The Russian acted after a fresh call in parliament on Wednesday for him to face sanctions after the invasion of Ukraine and there is already interest from a consortium fronted by the billionaires Hansjörg Wyss and Todd Boehly. Sources have said at least one other group is preparing to make an offer this week. Abramovich revealed that all net proceeds – understood to be the money from any sale minus legal fees – would be used “for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine”. He also confirmed he had written off the £1.5bn of loans he has made to Chelsea since taking over in 2003. The first move from interested parties came when Wyss, a Swiss businessman, said he had been invited to join a consortium. The 86-year-old, worth a reported £4.3bn, has partnered with Boehly, the part-owner of the LA Dodgers baseball team, who is worth an estimated £5bn. Several more investors are involved, with at least two others understood to be from the US. Interested parties have been invited to make official bids by March 15 Abramovich’s position had been under growing uncertainty since he announced plans to transfer the care and stewardship of Chelsea to the trustees of the club’s charitable foundation last Saturday. That move came amid calls in parliament for him to face sanctions, with the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, the latest to demand action on Wednesday. Abramovich has vehemently disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Vladimir Putin and Russia or that he has done anything to merit being sanctioned. But one source said that the 55-year-old had lost the will to fight because of the increasing political pressure. “I have always taken decisions with the club’s best interest at heart,” Abramovich said. “In the current situation, I have therefore taken the decision to sell the club, as I believe this is in the best interest of the club, the fans, the employees, as well as the club’s sponsors and partners. “The sale of the club will not be fast-tracked but will follow due process. I will not be asking for any loans to be repaid. This has never been about business nor money for me, but about pure passion for the game and club. Moreover, I have instructed my team to set up a charitable foundation where all net proceeds from the sale will be donated. The foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine. This includes providing critical funds towards the urgent and immediate needs of victims, as well as supporting the long-term work of recovery.” Abramovich said the sale was an “incredibly difficult decision” and that “it pains me to part with the club in this manner”. He said he hoped to make a final visit to Stamford Bridge to say goodbye. The Labour MP Chris Bryant, one of Abramovich’s fiercest critics, reacted by telling the Guardian: “It all feels like a desperate attempt to save face. And save himself from being sanctioned. All he really needs to do is go on telly and say: ‘Vladimir, take the Russian tanks back home and do it now.’” Sources have said that the powerful director Marina Granovskaia and chairman, Bruce Buck, would be unlikely to stay at Chelsea under a new ownership. Interested parties had been looking to move swiftly in case Abramovich is sanctioned by the UK government, at which point it is unlikely a sale would be permitted. It is understood the US bank Raine has been tasked with making the sale. Wyss told the Swiss newspaper Blick: “Abramovich is trying to sell all his villas in England, he also wants to get rid of Chelsea quickly. I and three other people received an offer on Tuesday to buy Chelsea from Abramovich. I have to wait four to five days now. Abramovich is currently asking far too much. You know, Chelsea owe him £2bn. But Chelsea has no money. As of today, we don’t know the exact selling price.” Born in Bern, Switzerland, 19 September 1935. He studied engineering, earned an MBA from Harvard, then worked in textiles in Asia and Europe. As a sideline he sold planes – with one sale introducing him to the co-founder of the Swiss medical device manufacturer Synthes. Wyss went on to found Synthes USA in 1977 and, in 2012, he sold it to Johnson & Johnson for $19.7bn (£14.8bn). What is he worth now? A more modest $5.8bn (£4.3bn), having, in 2013, signed the Giving Pledge set up by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, committing to give away most of his fortune. His Wyss Foundation – focused on environmentalism and progressive, anti-Trump politics – holds over $2bn in assets. In 2018 he pledged to donate $1bn (£751m) to environmental causes.  Any controversies? His financial influence on US politics, as a non-US citizen, has drawn criticism – but he remains focused on pushing an anti-populist agenda. Asked about Brexit in 2019, Wyss told Swiss paper Neue Zürcher Zeitung how voters had been “deceived by populist statements... For the British people’s sake, I hope that there will be another vote when all the facts are on the table.”  So why Chelsea? He hasn’t shared his vision, but the 86-year-old Wyoming resident isn’t going it alone, with the part-owner of the LA Dodgers, Todd Boehly, forming part of a consortium. Boehly, an investor, billionaire and fellow philanthropist, had a solo takeover bid for Chelsea rejected in 2019 and has previously been linked with Tottenham. He told Bloomberg at the time: ""One of the great things the Premier League has is that it’s on a Saturday morning in America. So you have an uncongested time slot that is now fully dominated by the Premier League. When I was growing up, Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, but certainly I didn’t know about Manchester United, I didn’t know about Chelsea, I didn’t know about Tottenham. Kids these days are fully aware of what’s the best and the Premier League is the best. I continue to believe there is a global opportunity for the best clubs.” David Hills Wyss said he would not act alone. “I can well imagine starting at Chelsea with partners,” he said. “But I have to examine the general conditions first. But what I can already say: I’m definitely not doing something like this alone. If I buy Chelsea, then with a consortium consisting of six to seven investors.” Boehly reportedly had a £2.2bn bid for Chelsea rejected in 2019 and is the co-founder, chairman and CEO of the the US company Eldridge Industries, which invests in sectors including media and sport. Wyss has worked with Boehly at Eldridge. The Swiss is is the founder and the former president and chairman of Synthes Holding AG, a medical device manufacturer, and a supporter of liberal and environmental causes in the US, where he lived for a number of years. The situation is fluid and other bidders are yet to publicly show their hand. The Ineos chairman, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, has reportedly tried to buy the club in the past. Starmer pressed Boris Johnson at prime minister’s questions to sanction Abramovich, telling the Commons: “He’s a person of interest to the Home Office because of his links to the Russian state and his public association with corrupt activity and practices. Last week, the prime minister said that Abramovich is facing sanctions. He later corrected the record to say that he isn’t. Well, why on earth isn’t he?” Johnson said it was not “appropriate” for him to comment on individual cases at this stage.

3/3/2022,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has appealed to Jewish people across the world to speak out against the Russian assault on his country, a day after a missile hit close to a Holocaust memorial site in the capital, Kyiv. The missile strike on Tuesday hit Kyiv’s television tower, reportedly killing at least five people. The tower is located close to the memorial site of Babyn Yar, the ravine where Nazi soldiers massacred up to 150,000 people during the second world war, including more than 30,000 Jews, who were shot there in the autumn of 1941 after the Nazi takeover of Kyiv. “For any normal person who knows history, Babyn Yar is a special part of Kyiv, a special part of Europe,” said Zelenskiy, in one of the regular video addresses he has been making throughout the war. “It is a place of prayer and a place of remembrance for the 100,000 people killed by the Nazis … Who do you think you are, to make it a target for your missiles?” During the Soviet period a television tower and other buildings were constructed on the site, but in 2016 the Ukrainian government along with Jewish groups and philanthropists launched a project to create a major new Holocaust memorial centre there. Yad Vashem, the Holocaust remembrance centre in Israel, issued a “vehement condemnation” of Tuesday’s attack. Yair Lapid, the Israeli foreign minister, said: “We call for the sanctity of the site to be preserved and honoured.” However, he did not directly condemn Russia in his words. Zelenskiy, keen to rally more support from Israel and also from Jewish communities worldwide, also mentioned that the city of Uman, a pilgrimage site for Orthodox Jews from the Hassidic Breslov movement, was hit on the first night of the war. “I am now addressing all the Jews of the world – don’t you see what is happening? It is very important that right now, millions of Jews around the world do not remain silent. Nazism is born in silence,” said Zelenskiy. Later on Wednesday several prominent groups representing Holocaust survivors condemned Russia’s claim that its military action in Ukraine is aimed at “denazifying” the country. “The signatories of this appeal denounce the use of the words ‘denazification’ and ‘genocide’ to justify the attack on Ukraine... We cannot accept that these words are tarnished in this way,” read a statement signed by representatives from the committees of several former Nazi concentration camps, including the International Auschwitz Committee, and those of Dachau, Buchenwald-Dora and Ravensbrueck. Under Vladimir Putin, the Soviet victory in the second world war has become a major building block of Russian national identity, and Putin has attempted to portray modern Russia as the inheritor of this proud anti-Nazi heritage, even as his government has targeted minorities, reduced freedoms and is now waging an expansionist war. Russia alleges, that since the Maidan revolution in 2014, Ukraine has been run by a far-right cabal, with Putin refering to the government in Kyiv as “a band of drug addicts and neo-Nazis”. This is despite the fact that Zelenskiy is Jewish and came to power after a democratic election in which he beat the incumbent, Petro Poroshenko. A statement from the management board of the Babyn Yar Holocaust memorial centre, released on Tuesday before the missile strike, said: “Russia has vulgarly instrumentalised anti-Nazi rhetoric and is trying to take on the role of a fighter against Nazism. “We remind the Russian leadership that Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities were last subjected to massive bombing by Nazi Germany during world war two. Now they are burning under the blows of Putin’s army, under the false and outrageous narrative of ‘denazifying’ Ukraine and its people.” While there is a far-right movement in Ukraine, and elements of it have been active in fighting against Russia-backed forces in the east of the country, the movement has little political power or influence on the government. The Russian government has persisted with its narrative of a neo-Nazi government oppressing Russian speakers, despite the fact that Zelenskiy’s native language is Russian. “It’s absolute and total nonsense,” said Rabbi Moshe Azman, the chief rabbi of Ukraine. “The country has democracy, it has freedom of speech and the president is Jewish. It’s simply a lie. The far-right parties didn’t even get into parliament.” Azman, who was born in Leningrad, now St Petersburg, recorded an angry appeal to Russians and Russian Jews on Tuesday, clutching a Torah and criticising the lack of public outcry in Russia against the war. “Remember that the people who are indifferent become accomplices in crimes against humanity,” he said.",News/World news,Ukraine president asks Jewish people around world to speak against Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/ukraine-president-asks-jewish-people-around-world-to-speak-against-russia
3/3/2022,"The signal from the White House was clear. Joe Biden is “very open” to the idea of adding oil and gas to the sanctions list as a way of escalating the west’s economic war against Vladimir Putin. Surging oil prices suggest traders think the die has already been cast: whether because governments take action directly or whether through self-sanctioning from western companies, oil and gas supplies from Russia are going to dry up. That will have serious consequences for Russia, but it will also add to cost of living pressures in the west. Even before this week’s rise in crude oil prices to more than $110 (£82) a barrel – the highest since 2014 – analysts were cutting growth forecasts and raising estimates for inflation. Including energy in the list of items targeted would mean oil and gas would be dearer for longer, increasing the risk of a slowdown turning into recession. The world economy is less dependent on oil than it was at the time of the first postwar spike in 1973-4, and uses the fossil fuel more efficiently. Back then it took a little less than a barrel of oil to produce $1,000 of output. By 2019 global oil intensity was 0.43 of a barrel per $1,000 of output. Even so, what happens to the oil price still matters and Russia – which is the second biggest exporter after Saudi Arabia – is a key player in the global market. So far, most economists think Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will merely dent the recovery they have pencilled in for this year. But as the Warwick University academic Prof Andrew Oswald has noted, almost every postwar recession has been preceded by a rise in oil prices. The cost of crude rose sharply in 1973, in 1979, in 1990 and in 2007. All were followed by recessions, though sometimes dearer energy was not the only factor. Three factors will determine the hit to western economies over the coming months. The first is whether energy continues to flow, something that is looking less likely by the day. Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB bank, estimates that 70% of the 4.3m barrels of crude Russia would normally be exporting daily is already frozen. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said the latest jump in oil prices reflected a sense that formal sanctions on Russia’s energy sector were inevitable. Rising oil prices were a windfall for the Kremlin, he added. “This is one of the reasons why western governments might play this card – the cognitive dissonance of squeezing Russia on all fronts with sanctions while still funding their war machine by buying oil and gas may not survive for long.” The second factor involves the size and the duration of higher oil prices. Most analysts assume crude will rise a little further – perhaps to $125 a barrel – and then start falling in the second half of the year. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said if oil and gas followed current futures pricing, UK inflation would peak at just below 8% in April and still be above 5% by the end of the year. Under an alternative scenario the oil price rises to $130 a barrel and stays above $100 until early 2023, while European wholesale gas prices rise to €160 (£133) a megawatt hour and end this year around €100 a MWh. In that event, Dales said inflation would peak above 8% and still be nudging 6% by the end of the year. Some fear the oil price could hit $150 a barrel, intensifying the squeeze on consumers. Businesses would also be hit, with more expensive energy and lower demand hitting profits. Finally, there is the question of how central banks will respond. Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, said events in Ukraine would not derail plans by the US central bank to start raising interest rates. The Bank of England, which has already increased borrowing costs twice in recent months, is also likely to tighten policy. What is not yet clear is how far and how fast interest rates will rise. One risk is that central banks do too little. An even bigger risk is that they do too much.",News/Business,Recessions tend to follow oil price surges – will this time be different?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/02/recessions-oil-price-surges
3/3/2022,"My cousin Andrzej Twardzicki, who has died aged 94, came to the UK after fighting with the Polish resistance during the second world war and settled in Britain, where he became an engineer and then an academic, lecturing at Queen Mary University of London and running postgraduate courses at Imperial College London. Andrzej was brought up in Kraków but born in Lwów, in the Ukrainian part of what was then the new republic of Poland, to Jadwiga (nee Siedlecka), who worked for the Red Cross as a translator, and her husband, Tadeusz, an adviser to the Polish ministry of agriculture. When Germany invaded Poland in 1939 his father joined the resistance, dying in a motorcycle accident on a secret mission, after which Andrzej’s older brother, Franek, joined the resistance in Warsaw and was killed a year later. Andrzej himself then joined up in Kraków, and took part in several ambushes of German patrols. In 1945, fearing the consequences of the Red Army’s approach towards Poland, he set off with two friends, reaching the safety of a sector of southern Germany, where he joined Polish II Corps, the operational unit of the Polish Armed Forces in the west. He was sent by ship to Scotland, where he lived in barracks for two years, learning English and managing to pass his general matriculation, after which he went to London University to study electrical engineering. After graduating, Andrzej worked for British Thomson-Houston, an engineering and heavy industrial company, in Rugby, Warwickshire. It was in Rugby that he met his landlady’s niece, Halina Kornela, a fellow Pole, who had lost both parents during the second world war and had come to Britain with her aunt. Andrzej coached her through her A-levels and two years later they got engaged. One of their first holidays together was an expedition to the Alps. Halina went on to study medicine and became a doctor. After they got married in 1962, the couple enjoyed an adventurous road trip through Europe, all the way to Yugoslavia. Back in Rugby, their first child, Anna, was born and Andrzej joined GEC, designing generators for ships and power stations and other big infrastructure projects, including the Kariba dam in Zimbabwe. After completing a master’s degree he began a long career in academia, eventually becoming senior lecturer in electrical engineering at Queen Mary University of London and running postgraduate courses at Imperial College London. After retirement in 1985, Andrzej did some freelance work for another decade and made many trips to Poland. A keen photographer, he captured some dramatic images of Kraków in 1983, when it had fallen under martial law. He worked for several charities, including Medical Aid For Poland, accompanying long-distance lorries to deliver medical equipment to hospitals during the clampdown on the Solidarity trade union. A keen walker and mountaineer, for some years he worked as a volunteer climbing guide in the Austrian Alps and the Tatra mountains in Poland.

3/3/2022,"The United Nations has voted overwhelmingly for a resolution deploring Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its forces, in a global expression of outrage that highlighted Russia’s increasing isolation. In an emergency session of the UN’s general assembly, 141 of the 193 member states voted for the resolution, 35 abstained, and five voted against. The only countries to vote no in support of Moscow were Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea and Syria. Longstanding allies Cuba and Nicaragua joined China in abstaining. The resolution, said the UN “deplores in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine”. It demanded that “the Russian Federation immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine” and “immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces”. The resolution is not legally binding, but is an expression of the views of the UN membership, aimed at increasing pressure on Moscow and its ally, Belarus. “It isn’t going to stop Russian forces in their stride, but it’s a pretty enormous diplomatic win for the Ukrainians and the US, and everyone who has got behind them,” Richard Gowan, UN director at the International Crisis Group, said. Speaking before the vote, the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, compared the Russian invasion to the Nazi conquest of Europe. “A few of the eldest Ukrainians and Russians might recall a moment like this, a moment when one aggressive European nation invaded another without provocation to claim the territory of its neighbour, a moment when a European dictator declared he would return his empire to its former glory and invasion that caused a war so horrific, that it spurred this organization into existence,” Thomas-Greenfield said. The Ukrainian permanent representative, Sergiy Kyslytsya, appealed to countries considering an abstention on the grounds that “it is not my war”. “It is a mistake. The evil will never stop. It requires more and more space to conquer. If tolerated it advances further and further,” Kyslytsya said. “The draft resolution is one of the building blocks to build a wall to stop it in Ukraine and not to let it go further.” The Russian permanent representative, Vasily Nebenzya, repeated Moscow claims that its forces were not targeting civilian areas. He attributed the lopsided nature of the vote to behind-the-scenes coercion on member states from Ukraine’s allies. “We know about the unprecedented pressure that our western partners are exerting on a large number of countries urging them to vote as they [the west] see fit,” Nebenzya said. “This is not something even we can call pressure. It was open and cynical threats.” On Friday, Russia was the sole vote against a similar resolution in the security council, but because Russia is one of the five powers with a veto, the resolution was not upheld. So Ukraine’s allies referred the matter to the general assembly. It is the first time in 40 years the security council has referred a crisis to the assembly and only the 11th time an emergency session of the UN general assembly has been called since 1950. It was summoned under a “uniting for peace” resolution, in which global threats are referred to the body “if the security council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility to act as required to maintain international peace and security”. In a reflection of the worldwide outrage at the Russian attack on Ukraine, six of Moscow’s allies who stuck by Russia in 2014, in a similar vote after the annexation of Crimea, abstained on this occasion: Armenia, Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua, Sudan and Zimbabwe. Another supporter from 2014, Venezuela, did not vote on Wednesday. Hungary and Serbia, European countries with the closest ties to Moscow, voted for the resolution condemning the Russian invasion. “The Republic of Serbia is committed to observing principles of territorial integrity and political independence of states as one of the basic principles of international law,” the country’s permanent representative, Nemanja Stevanović, told the assembly. Nebenzya shrugged off the significance of the vote, making clear that Russia would press on with its offensive. “This document will not allow us to end military activities,” Nebenzya said, blaming the fighting on “radicals and nationalists” in the Kyiv government.",News/World news,UN votes to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and calls for withdrawal,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/united-nations-russia-ukraine-vote
3/3/2022,"A week ago the sight was unthinkable: a memorial at the site of one of the worst massacres of the Holocaust, engulfed in smoke and flame from an airstrike. Yet on Tuesday a Russian attack near the Babyn Yar memorial complex in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, achieved exactly that. Five people died in the strike targeting the television broadcast tower next door, while firefighters battled to extinguish a fire caused by the explosion in a building inside the Jewish cemetery. Events in Ukraine since Vladimir Putin announced his invasion six days ago are grim echoes of the atrocities committed on European soil in the 20th century: desperate people squeezing on to trains out of cities; refugees lining up on the border; families separated as able-bodied men stay behind to fight. But government officials in Israel – a country that rose from the ashes of the second world war – have not directly condemned Moscow for the attack on Babyn Yar, and criticism of the invasion itself has been muted. Such is the balancing act Israel finds itself performing as war once again rages on the edge of Europe. On one hand it must stand with its western allies, support Ukraine’s Jewish president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and help the country’s Jewish population to escape new horrors. But on the other, Israel is loth to antagonise Russia, on which it relies to facilitate its military operations next door in Syria. Action of any kind could also stir up antisemitism against Ukraine and Russia’s large Jewish communities. Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust museum, has even found itself in the peculiar position of writing to the US ambassador to ask the US not to impose sanctions on the Israeli-Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, who is a major donor to Jewish institutions – and a longtime supporter of Putin. The former prime minister Ehud Olmert has suggested Israel’s position on Ukraine is implicitly compromised by its occupation of the Palestinian territories. And the country’s belated decision to vote in favour of a UN condemnation of Russia’s actions and to hold off on sanctions was met with disappointment from its US allies, coming “too little, too late,” according to a senior Israeli official who spoke to the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth. “Countries that have far more to lose have taken a clear stance. Only Israel, which is always good at reminding others about how they failed to stand by the Jewish people during dark times, has done everything not to do anything,” the source said. Yedioth Ahronoth also reported that in a phone call with Zelenskiy on Friday, the current prime minister, Naftali Bennett, denied Kyiv’s request that Israel supply arms, adhering to a longstanding Israeli policy designed to avoid provoking Russia. In the same call, Zelenskiy reportedly also asked Israel to mediate in the crisis – an appeal that appears to have borne more fruit, since Bennett made an offer to do so in a conversation with Putin two days later. On Wednesday Putin and Bennett spoke by telephone in a call initiated by Israel’s government, the Kremlin said. But even as Israelis with Ukrainian heritage sign up to defend Kyiv, for Israel’s security establishment, Europe’s new war is still a remote concern compared with dealing with the hostile forces on its own borders. Containing Iranian activity remains the country’s number one priority. Russian intervention in Syria’s civil war in 2015 turned the tide of the conflict in Bashar al-Assad’s favour. Moscow is now the major power in Syria’s skies, dropping bombs on Syrian civilians in areas still outside the regime’s control, and allowing the Israeli air force to operate against Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed groups active in the conflict. Michael Herzog, Israel’s ambassador to the US, said in a tweet on Wednesday: “While our moral position [on Ukraine] is clear, we are striving to pursue it in a way that will maintain our freedom of operations against Iran in the region, which is in everybody’s interest.” In the meantime, the first Israeli shipment of humanitarian aid has arrived on the Polish-Ukrainian border, which includes 17 tons of medical equipment and medicine as well as winter tents and sleeping bags for 3,000 people. About 200,000 Ukranians with Jewish ancestry are eligible for Israeli citizenship, and Tel Aviv is expecting an influx of between 10,000 and 15,000 people in the coming weeks. Shmuel Shpack, the Ukraine director for the Jewish Agency, which brings Jewish immigrants to Israel, said: “I never imagined I would end up doing what I am doing today. I’ve seen things I never thought I would see in my life, it’s like world war II, people sitting in lines for two days.” He has barely slept in the last week, fielding 200 phone calls a day from refugees at his new makeshift operations centre on the frontier with Poland. “Like everyone else, until the last moment we weren’t sure something was going to happen,” he said. “But now we have seen we have to prepare for full-scale war.”",News/World news,Israel tries to balance backing for Ukrainians and not offending Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/israel-tries-to-balance-backing-for-ukrainians-and-not-offending-russia
3/3/2022,"The White House released a 96-page plan on Wednesday to shift the fight against Covid-19 and “help move America forward safely”, past a crisis footing to a new “normal”. Announcement of the plan follows promises made in Joe Biden’s State of the Union speech late on Tuesday, which emphasized rapid rollout of a new “test to treat” model with free anti-viral pills after a positive test. This comes just a week after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) loosened mask guidance nationally, as more and more Democratic leaders have lifted pandemic-era restrictions and with the president urging workers to return to the office in-person. “We are moving forward safely, getting back to our more normal routines, and under the latest CDC recommendations most Americans in most of the country can now be mask-free,” said the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, Jeff Zients. Vaccinated Americans, he said, “have an extremely high level of protection against Covid, and it’s extremely unlikely you’ll end up in the hospital if you get the virus”. The administration’s plan has four main pillars: protect against and treat Covid-19 cases, prepare for new variants, prevent business and school closures and continue to distribute vaccines globally. Within those pillars are a mix of short- and long-term goals, many of which will require congressional funding. In the short-term, a “test to treat” model is expected to be rolled out this month. The model will allow people to be tested for Covid-19 and receive antiviral medication in “one step” at pharmacies, veterans’ centers and long-term care facilities nationally. The White House has also said it will seek to buy more vaccines, treatments such as monoclonal antibodies and antiviral pills, and tests and masks. Beyond the short-term goals, administration officials proposed a slate of long-term investments, including research for a pan-Covid-19 vaccine, national “centers of excellence” to treat so-called long Covid, and the ability to develop, manufacture and approve a vaccine within 100 days should a new variant arise. “We will have to contend with Covid at some level for some time to come,” said Dr Anthony Fauci, the president’s chief medical adviser. “This ongoing research investment is not only helping us turn the corner on Covid-19, but is vital to helping us prepare for future pandemics.” However, how much funding the administration is asking for remains unclear. Zients said the White House would “communicate that number to Congress” as it is finalized. It has already briefed congressional leaders on the need for short-term purchases. The White House announcement and State of the Union address also came with a new look and feel. At the State of the Union, Biden, Vice-President Kamala Harris and the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, were all mask-free. So, too, were White House officials when they announced the new Covid-19 plan, notably in-person rather than through a group video call. The White House has said repeatedly this is not a plan to “live with Covid”, any more than Americans “accept ‘living with’ cancer, Alzheimer’s, or Aids”. The new strategic footing from the administration has received a mixed response. Some public health leaders reacted with excitement to the “test to treat” plan, but revised CDC guidance has received a more tepid response. Critics have argued that the widespread end of masking shifts the burden of preventing Covid-19 to “vulnerable individuals”, and could be premature given past pandemic surges. However, the mood of the country may have already shifted – Americans of every political stripe have reported a high degree of frustration and exhaustion with the pandemic, according to recent surveys. Progress to global vaccination has been slow, putting the world at risk of new variants. To date, 64.4% of the world has received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose, but there is a gulf between high- and low-income countries. Just 13% of people in low-income nations have received a vaccine, compared with 79% in high- and upper-middle-income nations.",News/World news,White House unveils Covid strategy to usher in new normal as pandemic eases,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/white-house-new-covid-strategy-test-to-treat

3/3/2022,"Progressive Democrats notched victories in two of Texas’s congressional primary races on Tuesday while Ken Paxton, one of the most prominent Republicans in the state and Donald Trump ally, suffered a major blow. In the most closely watched congressional primary, Jessica Cisneros, a progressive Democrat, forced a runoff against Henry Cuellar, a nine-term congressman who is one of the most conservative Democrats in the US House. (Texas races go to a runoff if no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote.) Forcing a runoff is a major win for Cisneros, who narrowly lost to Cuellar two years ago. Cuellar has been dogged by corruption allegations after an FBI raid of his home and office earlier this year. Cisneros has been endorsed by the progressive group Justice Democrats, plus Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Joshua Blank, the research director of the Texas Politics Project at Austin, said it was difficult to predict whether Cuellar would ultimately prevail. “Handicapping his chances is difficult, because on the one hand, he likely has significant organization in the district, but on the other, an incumbent in a strong position shouldn’t find himself in so much trouble,” he said. “The focus has been on Cisneros’ progressivism and whether she can win in the general, but Cuellar is one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress and somewhat idiosyncratic within the party, so how this will turn out is anyone’s guess.” Progressives also scored another victory in a new congressional district that stretches from Austin to San Antonio. Greg Casar, a progressive favorite who led efforts to reduce the police budget on the Austin city council, easily won his party’s nomination. He is expected to easily win in the general election in November. In the Dallas area, Jasmine Crockett, described as one of the most liberal members of the Texas house of representatives, is headed to a runoff election against Jane Hope Hamilton. Paxton, the attorney general, was forced into a runoff with George P Bush, the Texas land commissioner and the face of a new generation of one of America’s most prominent political dynasties (his uncle is George W Bush). Paxton, who was endorsed by the former president, is one of the most outspoken conservative attorneys general in the country, and has been at the forefront of attacks on voting, abortion access, immigration and transgender Americans. He also led an unsuccessful lawsuit asking the US supreme court to overturn the 2020 election. But the fact that he is being forced into a runoff underscores how politically vulnerable he may be. He has been under indictment since 2015 for securities fraud and faces whistleblower allegations that he misused his office for personal gain. “Paxton will likely have an easier time with Bush, whose name and legacy in Texas carry a mixed set of baggage,” said Blank. Trump nonetheless tried to frame Tuesday’s results in Texas as a mark of his political strength. He noted that the dozens of Republican candidates he endorsed in the race either won or were headed to a runoff. But virtually all of the candidates Trump endorsed were running in non-competitive primaries and were expected to win. Trump also notably did not endorse Van Taylor, a Republican seeking re-election to Congress in the Dallas suburbs. Taylor voted in favor of a bipartisan 6 January commission, which drew ire from Republicans and several challengers. Taylor will now face a runoff against Keith Self, a former Collin county judge, who told the Texas Tribune that the congressman’s vote for a commission was a “huge issue”. Taylor’s district is one of several in Texas that was redrawn last year to become solidly more Republican. In 2020, his district was highly competitive – Trump narrowly carried it by 1 percentage point. Trump would have carried the district by 14 points under the new lines, according to Planscore. It’s a trend that illustrates how lawmakers are redrawing districts to make them less competitive, a move that benefits extreme candidates in the primary. Looming over the primary were sweeping new voting restrictions in Texas, in effect for the first time after Republicans in the state legislature passed them last year. Texas already limits mail-in voting to those aged 65 or older, or who have a qualifying excuse. For weeks, local election officials have been raising alarms that new identification requirements for mail-in ballots are causing them to reject tens of thousands of them. Lisa Wise, the election administrator in El Paso county, said earlier this week her office had flagged 27% of the 3,855 ballots it received so far for rejection. In Harris county, the most populous in the state, officials had flagged 10,876 ballots, 29% of those returned, for potential rejections. Leah Shah, a county spokeswoman, said the office was working to contact voters and get them to come in person to the election office to correct issues on their ballots. Voters have until Monday to come to the election office and fix defects in person. “The current numbers are unprecedented, far outpacing previous rejection rates. This outcome could have been avoidable if federal protections were in place,” said Mimi Marzani, the president of the Texas Civil Rights Project.",News/US news,Success for progressives in Texas while Trump ally suffers major blow,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/02/texas-primaries-trump-ally-ken-paxton-progressives
3/3/2022,"Two English councils are blacklisting a key Russian-owned gas supplier in a show of solidarity with Ukraine. Merton council in London has announced it is seeking to cancel its contract with Gazprom Energy less than a month before the company is due to begin a new one-year, £1m contract to supply gas across Merton’s buildings, including leisure centres, libraries and some schools. The council leader, Mark Allison, said: “I have asked officers to urgently review options to bring this contract agreement to an end to show our unity and empathy with the people of Ukraine. The atrocities being carried out by Russia are horrific. Any small step we can take is a step that must be taken.” The council has written to the government to ask for urgent changes to the laws around who councils can choose to do business with. “Under law all council contracts are commercially driven,” said Allison. “We need the ability to refuse to do business with such firms based on their moral or social suitability, not just their commercial offer.” Suffolk county council has also said it will break away from its £10m contract with the energy supplier. Its deal with the supplier started in 2020 and is due to run until 2023 but the council leader, Matthew Hicks, said the county was “actively pursuing” ending the contract early. Gazprom Energy, a subsidiary of Russia’s state-owned gas and oil giant, has been one of the largest suppliers of gas for UK businesses since 2010, accounting for about 20.8% of the market. The company provides gas and electricity to NHS sites, factories, businesses and public sector customers across the UK. According to its latest annual report, it supplied gas to 178,000 sites across the country in 2020. But as scrutiny mounts on the role of the Russian state energy giant in the UK, the owner of British Gas Centrica has also announced it is seeking to exit its deal with Gazprom “as a matter of urgency”. Centrica signed a gas supply contract with Gazprom’s UK-based trading arm in 2012 and has twice extended it, with the current deal due to run until summer 2025. But Chris O’Shea, Centrica’s chief executive, confirmed it had now entered into discussions with Gazprom about exiting this agreement. Shell announced it would “exit its joint ventures with Gazprom and related entities”, which are worth about $3bn and include its 27.5% stake in the Sakhalin-II liquefied natural gas facility. Last week BP said it would offload its 19.75% voting stake in the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft.",News/Business,English councils seek to end contracts with Russian-owned gas firm ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/02/english-councils-seek-to-end-contracts-with-russian-owned-gas-firm
3/3/2022,"Britain’s biggest housebuilder, Persimmon, has announced profits of nearly £1bn in 2021, but cautioned that the Ukraine invasion could disrupt the the UK economy in the year ahead. Persimmon’s profits jumped by nearly a quarter to £970m thanks to “positive pricing conditions” in every British region in which it operated, as the house price boom defied the coronavirus pandemic, it said on Wednesday. Dean Finch, Persimmon’s chief executive, said he was “mindful of the growing risk of an economic impact as a result of the tragic conflict in Ukraine”, but that he expected continued house price rises to “mitigate build cost inflation”, suggesting higher costs for materials and labour would be passed on to buyers. “The UK housing market remains supportive with demand continuing to exceed supply, favourable interest rates and good levels of mortgage availability,” he said. Persimmon said it had some built-in protection from increased materials costs, which could be further escalated by the Russian invasion, because it had increased capacity at factories producing timber frames, bricks and tiles. Vistry, the sixth biggest London-listed housebuilder, also announced bumper results on Wednesday, saying it had more than tripled its annual profits to £320m. Housebuilders in the UK have benefited from years of strong demand, thanks to a dearth of new homes. Nationwide, the UK’s largest building society, reported on Wednesday that prices of homes on which it offered mortgages increased by 12.6% in the year to February, with the average price crossing the £260,000 mark for the first time. Many analysts had expected the pandemic to end the extraordinary price increases, but a combination of unprecedented low interest rates and employment support schemes caused prices to defy lockdowns. The UK government indirectly fuelled house price growth by temporarily cutting stamp duty, a subsidy that has now been removed. Housebuilders have already set aside the costs of removing flammable cladding, found to be a key cause of the Grenfell Tower fire that killed 72 people. Persimmon built 14,550 new homes in 2021, 1,000 more than 2020 when housebuilding was temporarily disrupted by the first pandemic lockdowns. Its rate of private sales was 22% ahead of 2019, before the pandemic struck. Vistry built 8,600, more than in 2019. Both companies expected to improve on 2022. Vistry said it predicted a “significant step up in profits and returns in 2022”. Persimmon said it would increase sales volumes by 4-7% in 2022, while keeping similar profit margins. That would suggest a return to above-£1bn profits, a level previously seen only in 2018 and 2019. Persimmon shares gained 6.4% on Wednesday morning. Shares in Vistry, which was formed in 2020 from the merger of Bovis and Galliford Try, gained 6.6%. Yet some analysts question whether the housebuilders’ strong run can continue over the next year. Consumer price index inflation has risen to its highest level in 30 years, squeezing household incomes, with more increases to come next month. Economists expect the Bank of England to increase interest rates further this year, which could also dampen demand. “The backdrop is changing,” said Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, a restructuring consultancy. “House price growth this year is expected to be more muted and we have to question whether Persimmon will be able to absorb ever-increasing costs through higher selling prices.” Vistry’s chief executive, Greg Fitzgerald, said there had been “strong demand across all areas of the business”. He added that the company had experienced “extended lead times and inflationary pressures on certain products”.",News/Business,UK house price boom brings Persimmon windfall of nearly £1bn,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/02/persimmon-profits-jump-to-nearly-1bn-as-uk-house-price-boom-continues
3/3/2022,"Your editorials on foreign policy in Europe and the increasing barbarity of Vladimir Putin’s assault were both insightful and powerful. But they failed to address the roots of this catastrophic failure of so-called diplomacy. Principled foreign policy has long been mocked by neoliberals and politicians of all stripes in favour of “interests”. We should now understand where interest-based foreign policy has brought us. What’s more, it is hypocritical and craven. Interests were sufficient to justify and fight wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a myriad of smaller regions, but now its hegemony has brought us Russian hubris and fatal prevarication in the face of Putin’s crystal clear intention. Faced with this, European politicians succumbed to “motivated reasoning”, believing what their sclerotic diplomacy told them. What makes me despair is that even now there is an unwillingness to confront this. The opposite side of this counterfeit coin is the impotence of the UN and other multinational assemblies to confront unilateral transgressions. We have also contrived to bring this about through interests. We have looked away, offering only rhetoric where we calculated that our interests are more or less safe. Now that it’s in the heart of Europe, we cannot look away. Furthermore, the climate and biodiversity catastrophe means that this luxury of looking over the wall has evaporated. Economic and political connectivity can be manipulated to protect our interests. That is not even a remote possibility in the face of ecosystem collapse. Europe does not need a new foreign policy – we need a new global constitution and contract.Neil BlackshawCallian, Var, France  The danger of enforcing a no-fly zone is, your editorial says, “both obvious and immense”. Failing to level up the playing field between Ukraine and Russia is equally dangerous. At some point, the threat will have to be faced. A no-fly zone, together with a threat to take out the column advancing on Kiev, could well be the least risky way forward. At least it may stiffen the sinews of Russia’s generals. Failure to counter nuclear blackmail will mean giving carte blanche to Vladimir Putin. An early display of military resolve may well reduce the risk rather than enhance it.Roy BoffySutton Coldfield, West Midlands  Some of your correspondents (Letters, 25 February) have a strange idea about the fall of communism and the roles of Nato and the EU. I don’t recall any “triumphalism” at the fall of communism – only a feeling of relief that the people of eastern Europe could have greater freedom. For me, it meant that my friends and relatives from former eastern bloc countries could now freely visit me and I could visit them. Individual members of Nato and the EU can be “triumphalist”, but the organisations themselves can only represent what their members want. Blaming Nato and the EU for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is like blaming a child for a bully attacking him when the kid says he’d like to join his mates as a member of the local football club. The bully is entirely to blame for the unprovoked attack, just as Putin and his acolytes are entirely to blame for their unprovoked attack on Ukraine and, in the same way, Hitler and the Nazis were entirely to blame for their unprovoked attack on Poland.Sally ChurchillGraigwen, Rhondda Cynon Taf  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/3/2022,"Regarding Prince Charles’s new project at Dumfries House in Ayrshire (Prince Charles gets go-ahead for farming school in Scotland, 27 February), is he not aware that Scotland already has six countrywide centres of excellence teaching agricultural studies from national certificate level to degree and postgraduate study? One of them is in fact near Dumfries House, the Ayr campus of Scotland’s Rural College (SRUC). As well as offering six teaching and research facilities, SRUC also has eight farms, 25 consulting offices and eight veterinary practices. Instead of raising money to fund a new farm-skills school, it would be better to liaise with the present network of agricultural colleges and work with them to promote traditional skills within existing courses or to establish new courses. Elitist members of the establishment and government are largely ignorant of the vital role that further education colleges play in many young people’s education and training. They are grossly underfunded and ignored in favour of universities. They deserve more recognition and financial support for their role in offering well-supported, achievable stepping stones to qualifications in further and higher education for learners of all ages.Margaret McGregorAberdeen  Interesting to read that Prince Charles is to start a farming school in Ayrshire. Not too many miles further south, Newton Rigg agricultural college in north Cumbria finally closed in July 2021. Apparently it was not financially viable.
