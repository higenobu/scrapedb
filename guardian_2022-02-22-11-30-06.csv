2/22/2022,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has backed a push by Tasmanian senator Claire Chandler to allow sporting groups to exclude transgender people from single-sex sports. Campaigning in the Tasmanian marginal seat of Lyons on Tuesday, Morrison said he thought Chandler’s proposed private member’s bill to amend the Sex Discrimination Act was “terrific” and he had encouraged her to pursue it.  Under Chandler’s “save women’s sports” bill, which she introduced to the Senate earlier this month, changes would be made to the Sex Discrimination Act to “clarify” that the operation of single-sex sport on the basis of biological sex was not discriminatory. While the bill has little chance of being debated in the House of Representatives before the election, Morrison said he supported the legislation, which has been criticised by equality advocates. “I support it, as Claire knows. I think it’s a terrific bill and I’ve given her great encouragement,” Morrison said. “Claire is a champion for women’s sport and I think she’s been right to raise these issues in the way that she has. Well done, Claire.” According to the bill’s explanatory memorandum, the legislation intends to “ensure that organisers are not limited in their ability to operate single-sex sport by the threat of complaints of unlawful discrimination”. “The primary policy intent of the Bill is to acknowledge that categorisation by sex is a necessary and important mechanism to provide sporting participation and competitive opportunities for females. “It seeks to ensure that women’s single-sex sport is protected and encouraged, and that a male person is not entitled to demand inclusion into women’s sport on the basis of gender identity.” In introducing the bill, Chandler said that clubs faced the risk of legal action as the Sex Discrimination Act had “been used as a weapon” to pressure sporting organisations to allow males to play women’s sport. The prime minister’s support for Chandler’s push comes after the Coalition’s recent failed attempt to legislate religious discrimination laws after attempts to ensure transgender students were protected from discrimination. Five Liberal MPs crossed the floor to ensure the protection of gender non-conforming students under the Sex Discrimination Act, prompting the government to shelve its religious discrimination bill after a backlash from religious groups and faith-based schools. North Sydney MP Trent Zimmerman, one of the five MPs who crossed the floor against the wishes of Morrison, published a letter and drawing on Facebook on Monday from a young constituent thanking him for “crossing the floor for my trans bro”. “After two weeks in Canberra coming home and finding this in my mail today meant the world to me,” Zimmerman said. Morrison made the remarks in support of Chandler’s bill while campaigning in the eastern Tasmanian seat of Lyons, where he announced an $804m Antarctica package to be spent over the next decade. The prime minister said the package ensured “Australia had eyes” on Antarctica, where China was becoming increasingly assertive. “Where others who have different objectives to us, well, it’s an opportunity for us to be there and make sure that we’re protecting Antarctica from more exploitative interests,” he said. Morrison also spoke about Russia’s incursion into Ukrainian territory, saying threats of violence were “being used to seek to advantage a nation’s position over others”. “Russia should step back, it should unconditionally withdraw, back behind its own borders and stop threatening its neighbours,” Morrison said. “It’s unacceptable, it’s unprovoked, it’s unwarranted, and Russia should understand that by seeking to invade another country, that this cannot advantage them, and it would seriously and significantly cost Russia.”",News/Society,Scott Morrison backs bill that allows exclusion of transgender people from single-sex sports,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/22/scott-morrison-backs-bill-that-allows-exclusion-of-transgender-people-from-single-sex-sports
2/22/2022,"Mask rules are set to be relaxed in Australia’s three biggest states, with authorities also considering removing isolation requirements for household contacts of Covid-19 cases as part of a “big shift” towards living with the virus. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, announced that from 11:59pm on Friday, the public health recommendation for Victorians to work or study from home will be removed and masks will only be required in certain settings including public transport, hospitals and primary schools, and for workers in hospitality, retail and large events.  It aligns with a similar plan which will take effect in New South Wales from Friday. “We’re going to a situation on Friday where there are essentially no Covid rules, or so few that it’s unrecognisable to what it was a year ago, and indeed what it was two years ago,” Andrews said on Tuesday. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, also said her government would relax the requirement to wear masks in most indoor settings, from 6pm on 4 March. She told parliament the state was now confident that the peak of the Omicron wave had passed. “Mr Speaker smiles are back. We can put our masks away,” she said. Queensland will also scrap density limits for private homes, weddings and funerals and there will be no limits in food courts, hairdressers, gyms, private venues and universities from 4 March. Meanwhile, Andrews revealed he was in discussions with the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, on a plan that would allow asymptomatic household contacts of Covid-19 cases to leave isolation to attend work. “That could be connected to third doses, although that would be more an honesty thing – you wouldn’t be able to prove it, Andrews said. “It will be another way of trying to encourage people to go and get a third dose. “What we know as we head into winter, we’ve got to do everything we can to try and have a better outcome when it comes to furloughing [and] as RATs become more and more available.” Workers in several critical industries including emergency services, education, food distribution, transport and freight were given an exemption from isolation requirements when a family member tested positive in mid-January. They are required to wear a mask at all times, travel directly to work and take regular rapid antigen tests. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said this system had proved effective. “It has worked well with our nurses. People have been very responsible. If they’ve had symptoms, they’ve not come to work.” Hunt said. Andrews defended the decision to extend mask rules for students in grades three to six as the vaccination rate among the age group is lower than anticipated, among other considerations. According to data from the department of health on Monday, 54.2% of Victorians aged 5 to 11 years old have had one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Just 344 of the more than 7,000 vaccine doses administered on Monday were for children in the age group.

Private hospitals will be able to resume surgery at up to 100% capacity. In announcing the new settings, health minister Martin Foley also extended the deadline for some workers required to receive three doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. The third dose deadline for education workers who had their second dose on or before 25 October will be extended by a month to 25 March, while fully vaccinated workers who are not yet eligible will have three months and two weeks from the date of their second dose. Workers who are recent international arrivals must get a third dose within four weeks of arrival. “We’re balancing the need to support our health system with the benefits of easing restrictions in a careful and sensible way,” Foley said.
