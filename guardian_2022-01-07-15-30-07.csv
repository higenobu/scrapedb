1/7/2022,"New South Wales and Victoria have reintroduced some Covid restrictions as the Omicron variant spreads rapidly. With both states routinely breaking records for daily new cases, and with state leaders warning the situation is expected to get worse, both states have reinstated some measures aimed at slowing the spread.  These are the changes in NSW which come into effect from 8 January 2022 and are expected to be lifted by 27 January: Singing and dancing banned Singing and dancing will be prohibited at hospitality venues, entertainment facilities and major recreation facilities. This includes pubs, clubs, nightclubs, bars and restaurants. However, this does not apply to weddings, to performers, or to students and instructors. Rapid antigen test reporting system The NSW government is introducing a new reporting system for rapid antigen tests. The system will be launched on the Service NSW app and website, and will allow people to log their rapid antigen test results, so that they can count towards daily case numbers. The system will be made available from “next week.” Elective surgeries reduced Non-urgent surgeries have been suspended until mid-February, to ease the pressure on the health system. These include category three surgeries. Boosters mandated for some workers The NSW vaccine mandate for high-risk workers will “soon” include a requirement to have had a booster shot. Although it is not clear when that mandate will be introduced, it will cover frontline health workers and essential workers, as previous mandates have. Major events assessed NSW Health will conduct risk assessments of major events planned for the next few weeks, with premier Dominic Perrottet indicating they may be postponed. These changes are on top of previous restrictions introduced late last month, including a density limit of one person per two square metres and a mask mandate for indoor areas. And here are the new restrictions in Victoria which took effect at 11.59pm on Thursday, January 6: Density limits reintroduced Hospitality and entertainment venues are subject to tighter density limits again, with businesses subject to the one person per two square metre rules. The restriction applies to restaurants, cafes, pubs, nightclubs, arcades, amusement parks, casinos and gaming venues. Cinemas and theatres are currently exempt, where attendees are seated and masked. Mandatory rapid antigen test reporting The Victorian government has made changes to the testing regime, with those that test positive on rapid antigen tests now considered “probable cases.” That means they must isolate immediately for seven days, as well as having to notify their contacts. It will be mandatory to report the positive results to the Department of Health through an online registry or by phone. The system is set to go live on Friday. Strong recommendations The Victorian government also now “strongly recommends” people take a rapid antigen test before visiting aged care facilities and hospitals. The government also recommends working from home until late January. Non-urgent elective surgery paused The government has also paused all non-urgent elective surgeries, to help reduce the pressure on the health system. These restrictions join previous restrictions in place in Victoria, including an indoor mask mandate and limitations on visitations to hospitals and aged care facilities.",News/World news,"Victoria and NSW Covid restrictions explained: new limits for hospitality, testing changes and elective surgery pause",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/victoria-and-nsw-covid-restrictions-explained-new-limits-for-hospitality-testing-changes-and-elective-surgery-pause
1/7/2022,"Schools in England are “teetering on the edge” with more than a third (36%) struggling with staff absence rates in excess of 10%, according to a snap poll by a headteachers’ union. Almost one in 10 heads (9%) who took part in the survey said more than 20% of their teaching staff were absent on the first day of term for Covid-related reasons.  The staffing situation is already so critical in some schools that 4% of heads have had to send classes or year groups home for online learning, while almost 7% have combined classes or year groups in response to teacher absence. Half of school leaders said they were already dependent on supply teachers to cover classes, and more than a third (37%) were unable to source the supply staff they need, even via agencies – almost certainly because of high demand. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), said the results of the poll painted a worrying picture. The findings are based on nearly 2,000 headteachers’ experiences on the first day of term this week. The vast majority who took part were primary school leaders (76%), 5% were from secondary schools and the rest were made up of nursery, infant, all-through and middle schools. More than a quarter (27%) had in excess of 10% of their teachers off on the first day of term for Covid-related reasons. Nearly all of those surveyed (95%) reported pupil absences, and three in 10 (29%) were missing 10% of their pupils. “Staff absence on the first day of term was considerable and school leaders have been doing what they can to redeploy teachers and other support staff to avoid being forced to combine classes or send groups home,” Whiteman said. “Given that this is a snapshot of just the first day of term, this is a very worrying picture. Infection rates – and therefore absence due to illness – could very likely rise as the term progresses, and already half of schools are having to turn to supply staff, with many finding they cannot secure suitable cover. “Many schools are teetering on the edge and the next few weeks at least will undoubtedly continue to be an incredibly challenging time.” The shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said: “These stark figures reveal the extent of the government’s failure to plan for school staff absences this term. “Again and again our children have been treated as an afterthought by Conservative ministers, seemingly unable to act until it’s too late. It is incompetent, complacent and inadequate.” Elsewhere, there were reports of resistance among some pupils to masks and lateral flow testing. Damien McNulty, a national executive member of the NASUWT teaching union, told the BBC that in one Lancashire school, just 67 out of 1,300 pupils had agreed to have a lateral flow test and wear a mask. Teachers also remain concerned about ventilation in schools. In a separate NASUWT survey, more than half (56%) of the 2,000 who responded said they did not have access to a CO2 monitor in their classroom, despite government promises that all schools and colleges would be provided with monitors from the start of the current academic year. Of those who do have a monitor, 9% said it was not working properly. The government has said it wants schools to remain fully open despite soaring infection rates. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, conceded in the Commons on Wednesday that schools were already seeing staff absences and these were likely to get worse in the coming weeks, exceeding last term’s 8% peak. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We’ve supported schools to continue classroom learning for pupils through encouraging former teachers to step in and extending the Covid workforce fund for schools that are facing the greatest staffing and funding pressures. “We’ve also asked schools to have contingency plans to maximise attendance and minimise disruption to learning, should they have high rates of staff absence, and are working with the sector to share case studies of flexible learning models to support the development of those plans.”",News/Education,Schools in England ‘teetering on the edge’ with staff Covid absences,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/07/schools-in-england-teetering-on-the-edge-with-staff-covid-absences
1/7/2022,"Rather more than half of the population of Afghanistan is facing levels of food shortage not seen for decades. Just under 1,500 people died in the Mediterranean during 2021, attempting to flee to a safer environment. The likelihood of wildfires is predicted as a risk comparable to severe flooding in parts of the UK in the coming decades. About one person in 1,000 in the Democratic Republic of Congo has received full vaccination against Covid-19. And the challenge of the pandemic worldwide, the continuing background of loss and fear, still casts an enormous shadow. Statistics – not simply unconnected – that give a little flesh to the overall sense of 2021 having been a sombre year – on top of the low-level anxiety, the unexpected personal losses and the sheer confusion experienced by everyone caught up in the pandemic. The human story is not looking much like a smooth record of upward progress just now. We are more fragile than we had been led to assume. And this means that we are also less different from our ancestors than we normally like to think – and that the more secure and prosperous members of the human race are less different from their fellow-human beings than they find comfortable.  Our ancestors, right up to the modern age, knew they were fragile. A brief period of dazzling technological achievement combined with the absence of any major global war produced the belief that fragility was on the retreat and that making our global environment lastingly secure or controllable was within reach. But the same technical achievements that had generated this belief turned out to be among the major destabilising influences in the material environment. And the absence of major global conflict sat alongside the proliferation of bitter and vicious local struggles, often civil wars that trailed on for decades. But perhaps it is only in the past two decades that we have quite caught up with the realisation that global crises are indifferent to national boundaries, political convictions and economic performance. The vulnerability cannot be neatly cordoned off. For the foreseeable future, we shall have to get used to this fragility; and we are going to need considerable imaginative resources to cope with it. In the past, people have found resources like this in art and religion. Today it is crucial to learn to see the sciences as a resource and not a threat or a rival to what these older elements offer. It is more than high time to forget the phoney war between faith and science or art and technology. Belittling the imaginative inspiration of authentic science is as fatuous as the view that sees the arts as just a pleasant extra in human life, or religion as an outdated kind of scientific explanation. Just because inflated claims are made for science, and unrealistic hopes are raised, it is dangerously easy to forget why and how it matters, and to be lured into the bizarre world in which the minority report in science (about climate, pandemics or whatever) is given inflated importance just because we have been disappointed about the utterly unqualified certainty that we thought we had been promised. And what matters about scientific research is that it is not undertaken to prove an existing view correct, and so to reinforce the existing power or advantage of some over others. People rightly look with deep scepticism at research purporting to show that racial, social or sexual privilege is somehow grounded in the natural order. Ideally, what scientific discourse offers is not the guarantee of indisputable results that will simply tell us what to do, but a method of meeting each other in a shared exploratory conversation that will not be derailed by the presence in the room of non-negotiable convictions about the natural world that would make discussion on an equal footing impossible. Science helps us live with our fragility by giving us a way of connecting with each other, recognising that it is the same world that we all live in. We have to forget our self-protective habits in order to discover our shared challenges. But what science alone does not do is build the motivation for a deeper level of connection. We act effectively not just when we find a language in common to identify problems, but when we recognise that those who share these challenges are profoundly like us, to the extent that we can to some degree feel their frailty as if it were ours – or at least, feel their frailty impacting directly on our own, so that we cannot be secure while they remain at risk. This is where art comes in. Like the sciences, it makes us shelve our self-oriented habits for a bit. Listening to music, looking at an exhibition, reading a novel, watching a theatre or television drama, we open doors to experiences that are not our own. If science helps us discover that there are things to talk about that are not determined just by the self-interest of the people talking, art opens us up to how the stranger feels, uncovering connections where we had not expected them. What religion adds to this is a further level of motivation. The very diverse vocabularies of different religious traditions claim not only that the Other is someone we can recognise but that they are someone we must look at with something like reverence. The person before us has a claim on our attention, even our contemplation, and on our active generosity. The religions of south and east Asia question the very idea of a safe and stable self with a territory to protect against others; while for Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the claim of the stranger is grounded in the conviction that every human beings is a vehicle of God’s presence and God’s glory – “made in God’s image”. Being more deeply connected will not take away the fragility of our condition, but it will help us see that it is worth parking the obsessions of tribes and echo chambers so that we can actually learn from and with each other; that it is worth making what local difference can be made, so as to let the dignity of the human person be seen with greater clarity. “Our life and death are with our neighbour,” said one of the saints of early Christian monasticism. That is the humanism we need if we are not to be paralysed by the fragility we cannot escape.

1/7/2022,"The deadline for the decommissioning of the International Space Station (ISS) is worryingly close, and there is a danger that the commercial replacements the US was hoping for will not be ready to launch in time. With that in mind, on New Year’s Eve, Nasa announced that the Biden-Harris administration wanted to extend the operation of the ISS by six years to 2030.  Nasa must liaise with its international partners, Europe, Japan, Canada and Russia, to agree their participation. The ESA’s director general, Josef Aschbacher, has already tweeted his support. Keeping Russia as a full partner may prove more challenging. The Russian news agency Tass reported in April 2021 that a research and power module originally intended for the ISS would now become the first part of a national space station. On 2 December, Nasa awarded grants to three private companies to develop commercial space station designs. But they will not be ready for launch by 2024, so an ISS extension to 2030 will give those companies more time to build and launch. Also in the running is an earlier proposal by Axiom Space, which is building a commercial module for ISS that could be detached to become a private space station.

HV Chosen by Danielle Stephens A year ago this week, Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in Washington DC. Most who were interviewed that day believed they had a right to take back their country after they felt the presidential election had been stolen by Joe Biden and the Democrats. BBC journalist, Gabriel Gatehouse, decided to find out why so many people had been completely convinced of a different reality. In his BBC Radio 4 series, The Coming Storm, he journeys across the United States, talking to several people who provide insight into what – or who – was responsible for spreading one of the biggest mistruths US democracy will ever experience. You might think you’ve heard the story– QAnon, social media, disaffected voters – but Gabriel gets access to voices that shed a different light on a story commonly told. As he truly tries to understand why two Americans living on the same street could believe wildly different things, Gabriel comes across as less patronising than fellow journalists who have gone down a similar path. Scoring is sometimes overused, but overall, this is a must listen in order to understand what led to 6 January 2021. It’s quite a week for podcasts and last year’s Capitol Riots. As well as audio attempts to dissect the events from above-mentioned Coming Storm and The Assault on America, a new study has been released, analysing nearly 1,500 episodes from 20 of the most popular political podcasts.

1/7/2022,"The Hunterston B nuclear power station will shut down for ever at noon on Friday after 46 years of service, reducing the UK’s nuclear capacity by one-eighth and prompting calls from the industry for greater government backing for the sector. The plant, on the west coast of Scotland, provided one gigawatt of the UK’s 7.9GW nuclear capacity, enough to power to 1.7m homes.  But Hunterston B has lasted 20 years beyond its initial planned shutdown date and is one of several nuclear power plants being taken out of commission within several years of each other. The rapid pace of the decommissioning schedule has raised concerns about maintaining electricity generation. About 20% of Britain’s supply is provided by nuclear power from 15 reactors, which help provide a constant baseload to make up for shortfalls when electricity generation from renewables drops on windless days or when the sun is not shining. Almost half of the country’s nuclear capacity is scheduled for retirement by 2025 with the closure of Hunterston B, Hinkley Point B, Hartlepool 1 and Heysham 1. While more renewable energy will have been brought online by then and other fuel sources such as gas can fill in the gaps, the remaining 3.6GW of nuclear capacity would only be able to meet 6% of peak demand forecast for this winter. At its peak between 1995 and 1999, nuclear capacity hit nearly 13GW, about a quarter of the UK’s electricity needs. EDF is due to finish its 3.2GW plant Hinkley Point C, Britain’s first new nuclear power station in 20 years, by 2027. The first of its two reactors is scheduled to come online a year before that. The Nuclear Industry Association, which represents companies across the civil nuclear supply chain, estimates that the national capacity could reach 14.25GW by 2035, depending on whether £1.7bn in funding for the proposed Sizewell C plant is confirmed and the Wylfa Newydd project on Anglesey can attract investors. Development is likely to hinge upon government plans for a new financial framework, known as a regulated asset base (RAB) model, which would lock in higher returns for institutions funding nuclear plants and transfer risk to taxpayers. The NIA’s projection for the growth of nuclear also depends on the scale of the rollout of Rolls-Royce’s small modular reactors (SMRs) which have received £450m of government funds. The association criticised a decision by the Scottish government to bar new nuclear projects in Scotland, saying the gap left by Hunterston B would have to be filled in part with imported gas sourced from volatile global markets. This would drive up consumer bills, hamper emissions reduction plans and threaten Scotland’s energy security, it added. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the NIA, said: “Hunterston B has shown the best of what nuclear can provide for Scotland – clean, reliable power to keep the lights on and save our planet, and long-term, skilled jobs on which people can build a life and a family. “The dedicated staff who have helped keep Scottish homes warm and light for 46 years deserve our gratitude. As the current energy crisis demonstrates, without nuclear the cost of the electricity we rely on is higher, causes pollution and leaves us reliant on burning imported fossil fuels. That’s why we need new nuclear – to get to net zero and provide the reliable, secure and clean power to live our lives.”",News/Business,Hunterston B nuclear power station retires after 46 years in service,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/07/hunterston-b-nuclear-power-station-retires-after-46-years-in-service
1/7/2022,"The head of the UK Health Security Agency raised concerns about low-paid workers being disadvantaged by changes to the Covid testing regime in England, as they would still need a PCR test to access financial support for isolation, a leaked internal memo shows. The memo from Dame Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UKHSA, also highlighted a greater risk of false negatives for those on lower incomes forced to go to a testing centre to ensure they received the £500 Covid test-and-trace support payments.  Under the changes made this week, most people who are asymptomatic can rely on positive lateral flow results to self-isolate, without having to take a confirmatory PCR test. But those seeking £500 Covid support payments for isolation will still need to get PCR tests because of government concerns about potential fraudulent claims if people are allowed to claim the support payments based on self-reported lateral flows. In the note written before Christmas, Harries flagged concerns that low-paid workers seeking access to financial support payments would have a higher chance of falsely being told they were negative for Covid. Harries wrote: “In higher prevalence periods, the abandonment of confirmatory PCR would mean that the people most likely to receive a false negative and therefore potentially become ill and then seek hospital care later and therefore more likely to die would be more likely to be those from lower socioeconomic groups who also have higher risk of underlying health conditions as additional risk factors.” The government made the changes this week, partly to ease pressure on the PCR testing system while Covid case numbers are at an unprecedented level, and to allow people to start the clock on isolation periods earlier. However, there were also concerns among public health officials that a confirmatory PCR was counterproductive because of the risks of false negatives. Some experts have previously highlighted that there is still a reasonable chance of a person having Covid if they have a positive lateral flow followed by a negative PCR, with the PCR missing a positive result around one in 20 times. It is understood that data prepared for the health secretary, Sajid Javid, this month contained estimates that about 9,000 out of 195,000 confirmatory PCR tests taken in November in England were false negatives. This suggested that 45% of all negative PCR results after a positive lateral flow result were false. Because of concerns about potentially fraudulent claims, the decision was made by the government to continue to ask for a confirmatory PCR from those who want to claim a test-and-trace support payment, currently worth £500 per isolation. However, the UKHSA flagged worries that this put lower socioeconomic groups at higher risk of false negatives than the general population, particularly when there is high prevalence of Covid in the community. This means those people are potentially being wrongly told not to isolate and not getting support payments, and are at risk of false reassurance and passing it on to contacts. In Wales, support payments are given out for self-reported tests without the need for a confirmatory PCR. It is difficult to quantify the number of people affected, but the House of Commons Library found about 370,000 support payments had been made by November. Around 1 million applications are likely to have have been made because, based on previous data, the success rate is estimated to be about a third. The level of payments is also likely to have risen again substantially during the latest wave of Covid. The UKHSA declined to comment on the leaked memo.",News/Politics,"England Covid testing changes could hit low-paid workers, leaked memo warns",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/07/england-covid-testing-changes-could-hit-low-paid-workers-leaked-memo-warns
1/7/2022,"GB News was accused of prejudicing the trial of the Colston Four after it published opinion pieces criticising the defendants midway through court proceedings. The rightwing news channel was summoned to Bristol crown court halfway through the trial in relation to an article and video monologue by the presenter Mercy Muroki titled “I’m in favour of white people calling out racism … but the Colston saga reeks of white guilt”.  In the piece Muroki commented on the ongoing trial and suggested that Bristol council and local police officers might have colluded with a “bunch of anarchic protesters” to tear down the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston. She added: “I don’t need a bunch of white hippies crippled by white guilt to throw a largely irrelevant statue in a river to prove they’re not racist.” Although journalists can report on most court proceedings, there are tough legal restrictions on what the media can publish before the end of a trial in case it prejudices the jury. At a hearing on 23 December – which can only now be reported – Judge Peter Blair QC considered whether GB News’ decision to air the monologue constituted contempt of court. “The most pressing matter from my court’s perspective is to ensure that the safety of my trial process is maintained and that I don’t have the risk of jurors coming across this sort of material and the trial being prejudiced by them being influenced,” he said. The judge read out GB News’ editorial guidelines in court and expressed dismay at Muroki’s opinion piece, saying: “I am struggling to see how, as in GB News’ charter, that this article is ‘respectful’ or ‘sets an example by treating others in a way that they would wish to be treated’.” However, the judge ultimately decided not to pursue a contempt of court charge. The four defendants – Rhian Graham, 30, Milo Ponsford, 26, Sage Willoughby, 22, and Jake Skuse, 33 – had argued GB News had created a substantial risk of serious prejudice by publishing the material. Graham’s lawyer Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh argued the GB News monologue “pours scorn on the defendants and it pours scorn on my client in particular”. She said the decision to publish the article during an active trial was “not only contempt, it is entirely uninformed contempt based on fundamental ignorance of what has occurred in these proceedings”. GB News’ representative, Claire Overman, told the court there had been a “breakdown in communication” at GB News on the day the article and video was published. She said the lawyer on duty at the channel only had a few minutes to look at it while also reviewing other on-air content. “[The duty lawyer] accepts that by any view on his part he did not appreciate the concern arising from the contents in the time he had,” she said. She added that GB News had put in place “immediate steps to ensure something like this does not happen again” and would send its staff on media law training to ensure they understand contempt of court law. A local blog called Alternative Bristol was also separately summoned to court for a potential contempt of court during the trial. They were let off with a warning after apologetically telling the judge they were “more a group of activists than journalists” and in any case “the site only has about 150 hits a day”. In a statement, Judge Blair said he had decided not refer GB News to the attorney general over the potential contempt of court: “The swift response of GB News in seeking to remedy the position when my concerns came to their attention, the promise of undertaking further focused training of journalists on matters of ‘contempt of court’ and their frank acknowledgment of their errors are, in my view, sufficient and proportionate steps to reflect their culpability on this occasion.” All four defendants in the case were found not guilty of causing criminal damage by the jury on Wednesday afternoon.",News/Media,GB News accused of prejudicing Colston Four trial,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/07/gb-news-accused-of-prejudicing-colston-four-trial
1/7/2022,"Ah, the heady 00s heyday of the Wag. This was the decade when football players’ wives and girlfriends outshone their pig’s bladder-kicking partners. The golden era of Victoria Beckham, Cheryl Tweedy, Coleen Rooney, Louise Redknapp and their pouting, perma-tanned pals. They shopped hard, they partied harder, they were somehow blamed when England lost. And maybe it was all inspired by one infamous TV drama. Riding high from the ratings success of its schlocky prison series Bad Girls, production company Shed – co-founded by Corrie alumni – decided to bring a bit of filth to the beautiful game. Glossy ITV romp Footballers’ Wives debuted 20 years ago this weekend, and instantly became a seminal slice of TV trash.  Early scripts were loosely based on Footballers’ Wives Tell Their Tales, a book of candid interviews by Shelley Webb, the wife of former Manchester United and England midfielder Neil. Except the resulting TV show was so salaciously over the top it made its source material look like Enid Blyton by comparison. It shot. It scored. It celebrated with a fishbowl cocktail and a lapdance. Gaudily glamorous, shamelessly steamy and knowingly camp, Footballers’ Wives was modelled on 80s US supersoaps Dallas and Dynasty. Its scheming anti-heroine Tanya Turner (a role written with actor Zöe Lucker in mind) was JR Ewing and Alexis Colby rolled into one bodycon-frocked, bling-draped package. Set at the fictional Premier League club Earls Park FC, nicknamed Sparks, the story initially focused on three contrasting couples. First came the sweet, sympathetic pair: new Sparks signing Ian Walmsley (Nathan Constance) struggled to find his feet in the first XI, while his wife, Donna (Katherine Monaghan), tried to track down the child they were forced to give up for adoption in their teens. Next came the Posh-and-Becks avatars. Gloriously named glamour model Chardonnay Lane (Susie Amy) and resident heart-throb Kyle Pascoe (Gary Lucy) were busy planning their Snow White-themed wedding – a fairytale bonanza of bad taste with matching pink thrones, sponsored by a glossy magazine. Remind you of anyone? However, the most compelling couple by far were villainous team captain Jason Turner (Christian Solimeno) and his wife, Tanya, AKA Lady Macbeth in a mock-Tudor mansion. This alpha tigress sashayed across the screen with her peroxide power-bob, trademark long talons and rattling jewellery, ruthlessly plotting her way to the top. Lucker admitted she based her portrayal not on any specific real-life Wag but on Sharon Stone’s performance as gangster’s moll Ginger in Martin Scorsese’s Casino. The production’s makeup artist apparently went through 22 tubes of mascara per series on Tanya alone. Action unfolded in boardrooms and bedrooms, rather than on the boring old football pitch. Outrageous plotlines took in child kidnapping, cocaine-snorting, psychotic stalkers, sexually abusive nurses, deadly drunken brawls, megabucks match-fixing and high-profile court cases. And you thought the “Wagatha Christie” scandal was daft. Kyle’s meddling mother, Jackie (ageless EastEnders stalwart Gillian Taylforth), had graphic sex with love rat Jason on a snooker table. Cue insalubrious “potting the pink” headlines and Tanya accusing him of “shagging Old Mother Hubbard”. Series two climaxed with a Who shot JR?-style cliffhanger when Jason fell from a rooftop to his death after an unseen assailant walloped him with (what else?) a champagne bottle. It duly became one of the most talked-about dramas on TV, albeit not always for the right reasons. Ratings reached an impressive 7m. Sky’s long-running but relatively pedestrian soccer drama Dream Team had topped the TV league table until Footballers’ Wives swaggered on to the scene and snapped up all the silverware like a glory-seeking club with a new billionaire owner. Characters lived in Essex mansions with swimming pools and ponies. “We’ve got it, so spend it!” went the wives’ motto. Stadium sequences were filmed at Crystal Palace’s Selhurst Park ground and the now-demolished White Hart Lane, the former home of Tottenham Hotspur. The show’s logo was a glitterball/football hybrid, with the programme title styled as “footballers wive$” – all lower case with no apostrophe, which only irritated the snobs even more. It spawned late-night spin-off Footballers’ Wives: Extra Time and even a mockumentary chatshow, Footballers’ Wives TV. The series was remade in Germany, Italy, the US and Canada (where the sport was tweaked to feature the wives of ice hockey stars). Celebrity cameos added to the in-jokey cheesiness. Among the familiar faces popping up were footballers, obviously (Sol Campbell, David Seaman, Teddy Sheringham) plus a ragtag selection of random C-listers (Katie Price, Peter Stringfellow, Rula Lenska, Peter Andre, Lionel Blair, Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, Richard and Judy). Earls Park started to resemble a provincial panto. From the third series onwards, the action revolved even more around its MVP, the newly widowed Tanya – notably her love triangle with Amber and Conrad Gates, the club’s bisexual new skipper and his violently possessive wife (played by Laila Rouass and Ben Price). The two women had a designer handbag-swinging catfight in clear tribute to Dynasty’s Krystle v Alexis fisticuffs. Shark-eyed players’ agent Hazel Bailey (Alison Newman) arrived to stir up trouble (and sleep with Tanya). Chardonnay died from anorexia. A baby was swapped for another, then smothered by a jealous pet pug. Tanya literally shagged a rich old man to death for money. Between the third and fourth series, the demonic diva “crossed over” into Bad Girls for three episodes after she was jailed for drug possession. Naturally, Tanya soon poisoned her fellow HMP Larkhall inmates and blagged her way out. Casting became a revolving door. Storylines disappeared up their own players’ tunnel (suicide pacts, Chinese Triad gangs and intersex babies ahoy). Viewership dwindled to 3.7m. The final series was graced by former Dynasty super-bitch Joan Collins, one of Tanya’s touchstones, but not even the doyenne of melodrama could halt the ratings slump. The final whistle was blown after five series and 42 episodes. At least it got a suitably ludicrous send-off. The 2006 Sport Relief telethon featured a spoof mini-episode titled The Last Ever, Ever Footballers’ Wives, with Graham Norton playing Earls Park’s latest signing, the tastefully named Brendan Spunk. The show is now regarded as something of a kitsch cult classic, regularly appearing in meme form on social media. A nostalgic fanbase means it does brisk business on streaming service BritBox. There are periodic rumours of a reboot. Its influence can also still be felt today, in the likes of Apple TV+’s breakout hit Ted Lasso – a more comedic, transatlantic take on the same material. Richmond FC and Earls Parks FC are both suburban London teams who wear blue kits. With her blond mane and power-frocks, club owner Rebecca Welton even bears a visual resemblance to Tanya – perhaps inspired by actor Hannah Waddingham’s brief stint on Footballers’ Wives back in the day. Meanwhile, Keeley (Juno Temple), the model girlfriend of coach Roy Kent, is a Wag straight out of the Earls Park VIP lounge. Unlike folksy Coach Lasso and co, Footballers’ Wives might not have bagged Emmys nor Golden Globes. Heck, it barely earned any TV Quick Awards. But it was huge fun while it lasted and now it’s turning 20.

1/7/2022,"Due to the unseasonably mild temperatures we’ve been experiencing, hedgehogs are still sporadically visiting the garden feeding station, and it’s not unusual to find a variety of other creatures sheltering inside – the odd blood-engorged tick that has dropped off its hedgehog host, rabbit hutch spiders (Steatoda bipunctata), garden (Arion hortensis) and leopard (Limax maximus) slugs, and several species of woodlouse. Common rough woodlice (Porcellio scaber) are most prevalent. There are usually a dozen or more congregating in the damp crevices between the lid and walls, or searching for food – while their diet consists largely of decomposing plant material, they are also partial to biscuit crumbs, hedgehog faeces and the degrading chipboard floor.  As I opened the box one evening, a horde of woodlice erupted, cascading down the walls and scrambling over each other as they fled from the light. Clusters of 2mm-long white juveniles surrounded several of the light grey, dimple-backed adults. Females breed up to three times a year, producing between 12 and 36 eggs. They hatch their offspring in a marsupium – a brood pouch similar to that of a kangaroo. Juveniles emerge after their first moult, but remain with their mother for several months, until they reach maturity. As terrestrial isopods don’t have a waxy cuticle, they are susceptible to drying out, particularly the vulnerable young. Research suggests that aggregation is a mechanism of resistance to desiccation, reducing the rate of water loss due to a decrease in the surface area/volume ratio of the group. A faint scent reminiscent of rotting fish and stale sweat emanated from the colony. Woodlice don’t urinate; instead they excrete waste through their exoskeleton in the form of ammonia gas, and it’s this unpleasant odour that inspired vernacular names including stinky pigs, pissibeds, pishamares, and cheesy bugs/bobs. While most of the woodlice retreated, a few individuals froze. As I set down the food bowl, I gently nudged them out of the way. Rather than relying on their armour-plated shells for protection, they rolled on to their backs and played dead. Once they had determined that the danger had passed, they flailed their 14 legs, flipped over, and scurried into the shadows.

1/7/2022,"March 2020 seems like an age ago. And also like it was yesterday. The month begun more or less like any other March in New Zealand. The weather was typically warm and dry, most people were back in the office or on site, and parliament was sitting after its generous summer recess. In most respects you could mistake March 2020 for March 2019. Except, on 4 March, the country recorded its second coronavirus case after a woman returning from northern Italy, where this strange virus had taken hold, presented with the infection at the border. The number of infections increased again and again as the month unfolded with 647 come 1 April.  In the early days of March, government advisers and prime minister Jacinda Ardern were aiming, like the rest of the world, for either “herd immunity” or “flattening the curve”. But when the government’s chief science adviser presented advice on precisely what this meant for the health system – a quick collapse, essentially – Ardern went for the approach her advisers at the universities of Otago and Auckland were advocating: elimination. On 25 March the prime minister made her way to parliament’s debating chamber and in a historic speech announced a national state of emergency and a move to an alert level 4 lockdown. The speech helped generate unprecedented national solidarity. More importantly, the lockdown announced didn’t just flatten the curve. It absolutely smashed it. But in 2022, as Omicron threatens to wreak as much, if not more, damage than any previous Covid-19 variant ever could have, the lockdown course of action is probably off the table. That seems counterintuitive. But 2022 is (obviously) a different year. Shortsighted business owners in Auckland are unlikely to tolerate another round of restricted trading or slightly slower supply chains. Pathetic anti-vaxxer activists are more organised than ever before, corralling the tiny rump of unvaccinated New Zealanders in a way that makes them appear more significant than their numbers justify. And some segments of the media continue to platform anti-science, anti-lockdown views. With the lockdown option probably off the table, New Zealand is likely to catch up with the rest of the world. When the Omicron outbreak happens, the health system will begin buckling under the pressure of Covid-19 admissions and politics will become increasingly polarised after two years of near consensus. When the first lockdown happened, activists and political commentators were arguing that things couldn’t go back to how they were. The prime minister had implemented a successful wage subsidy, helping keep thousands of people in work, a freeze on rent increases was implemented, and the government brought forward millions in infrastructure investment. This was a social democratic programme that many people wanted to stay. Why? Because it worked. New Zealand enjoyed exceptional GDP growth, historically low unemployment levels, and a year like any other. Schools and businesses were open, concerts and mass gatherings were happening, and people were generally happy with their lot. But underneath this apparent success story were the same inequalities as before. House prices were still through the roof, defying policies aimed at slowing their growth. The house market is now worth far more than the country’s annual GDP with that wealth accumulating overwhelmingly in the hands of baby boomers. Uncharacteristically high inflation is also eating away at the purchasing power (and the already minimal savings) of the working and middle classes. This brings us to perhaps the good news for 2022. The government can no longer ignore the inequality crisis. The prime minister, who in one of her historic mistakes, ruled out a capital gains tax in 2019, must now implement other policies to arrest house price rises. The central bank must grab inflation by the neck. And historically low unemployment must translate to wage growth, perhaps with the assistance of the government’s Fair Pay Agreement (FPA) legislation. Under FPA’s, an industry-wide floor will be set for wages and conditions – meaning, for example, that supermarket or security workers must be paid at a minimum level. When this legislation passes in late 2022 it will have wide reaching effects, including making housing more affordable for previously underpaid workers and helping offset some of the worst impacts of relatively high inflation. And so in a social and political sense, 2022 has much to commend it. But in a health sense it is, of course, scary. It’s difficult to predict what an Omicron outbreak might bring. But we can take some comfort in that the government and New Zealanders have eliminated outbreaks before. We’re tantalisingly close to eliminating the recent Delta outbreak. And because of this, we’re more cognisant of the inequalities each outbreak exposes. Now, we must tackle those inequalities before Omicron makes them any worse.",News/World news,New Zealand’s successful Covid policies hid inequality – the government can’t ignore it this year | Morgan Godfery,https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2022/jan/07/new-zealands-successful-covid-policies-hid-inequality-the-government-cant-ignore-it-this-year
