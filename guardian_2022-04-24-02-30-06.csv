4/24/2022,"Scott McTominay has laid bare the crisis that has overtaken Manchester United, saying there are a “whole load of problems in terms of players, staff, everything higher up”. The midfielder was hugely frustrated after the 3-1 defeat at Arsenal – when United had the chances to have taken something – and accused the team of lacking the “fundamentals of football” including “balls” and belief. “It is pride on the pitch – give your best, everyone,” he said. “There are a lot of things going on at the minute. When we get back in the dressing room – it’s go home and take a look at yourself in the mirror. You can’t go back to your house and be satisfied with conceding three goals away at Arsenal when we deserved to win the game. “For us, self-belief, lack of confidence – you can see it all in the last two months. We had a half-decent game but even then it is the belief, which is so big in football. It is just not there. It is a bit of balls in your performances. That is what it comes down to – the fundamentals of football. It is difficult for me to speak right now because there are so many emotions. It comes down to the basics and we never do them well enough in big games, recently.” Paul Scholes said on BT Sport that the United midfielder Jesse Lingard had described the dressing room as a disaster. “You’ll have to ask Jesse Lingard, if you have this information,” Ralf Rangnick, the interim manager, said. “I think the whole group get on reasonably with each other. I’m not daring to say they get on well with each other. I don’t see there is an issue in regard to the locker room.” Rangnick argued that VAR had conspired against his team at the Emirates. He felt Nuno Tavares had fouled Anthony Elanga in the area, Cédric Soares had handled under pressure from Jadon Sancho, and Eddie Nketiah had been offside and impeding David de Gea’s view of Granit Xhaka’s decisive third goal. Even worse, Rangnick claimed to have seen stills that showed Cristiano Ronaldo had been onside when he spun and fired home for what would have been 2-2. “If this is the right picture, and I suppose they showed me the right picture, you could see it – it was clearly one line in one line,” he said. “This is why we have a VAR.” Rangnick accepted United had to defend better and press more often. Why had they unravelled of late? “The defeat to Atlético Madrid [in the Champions League last 16] destroyed a lot of hopes and also the emotions of some of the players, which I can understand,” he said. “It’s hard to motivate and keep the energy level high. You look at the league table – with Tottenham and Arsenal – and it’s not very realistic to dream and talk about the top four.” The game turned on Bruno Fernandes’s penalty miss at 2-1. Asked why Ronaldo did not take the kick, Rangnick said: “I spoke with him after the game and he said he didn’t feel he should take it.”",Sport/Football,McTominay accuses Manchester United of lacking ‘fundamentals of football’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/23/manchester-united-lack-fundamentals-football-scott-mctominay-arsenal
4/24/2022,"Whoever wins the presidential election in France, one man is determined to sideline them and restrict their powers. Even before the result is known tomorrow, the radical left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who has emerged as a surprise kingmaker, has called on voters to make him prime minister in the legislative elections in June. Mélenchon, a fervent opponent of both Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, pledged that if successful he would force whoever wins the keys to the Élysée tomorrow into an uncomfortable parliamentary “cohabitation” that would hamstring efforts by them to pass reforms the left opposes. The 70-year-old leader of La France Insoumise (LFI – Unbowed France), who had promised to retire after his third presidential bid, said giving his party a majority in the Assemblée Nationale would make the election a “third round”. It would also resolve the dilemma for those voters – especially on the left – who felt politically orphaned by the first round result a fortnight ago. Many of the 7.7 million people who voted for Mélenchon have said they will abstain tomorrow. Last week, as Macron, 44, and Le Pen, 53, crossed France attempting to attract the almost 50% of the electorate who did not vote for either, LFI was engaged in frantic negotiations with ecologists and communists to form a united bloc to oppose the eventual winner. Polls released on Friday suggest Macron is still favourite, but the legitimacy of his second term will be questioned if he does not secure a convincing victory. The legislative vote is traditionally fought on party lines, but Mélenchon is determined to make it personal. “I ask the French to elect me prime minister. I ask them to elect a majority of MPs from La France Insoumise. And I call on all those who want to join the Popular Union [of the left] to join us in this beautiful combat.” He reminded voters it was the PM not the president who signed off government decrees. “I would be prime minister not by the grace and favour of M Macron or Mme Le Pen, but because the French wanted it,” he said, adding it would make the president “secondary”. He ruled out any negotiation with the new president. “If it does not suit the president then they can go, because I will not,” he said in an interview with BFMTV. Mélenchon’s ambitions were boosted after he polled just 421,308 votes behind Le Pen in the first round on 10 April, which saw the collapse of the traditional left- and rightwing parties. The three other leftwing candidates – from the Ecology party, the Communist party and Socialist party (PS) – polled a total of just over 3m votes. That would have ensured his second-round place had they supported his campaign. The result angered many Mélenchon supporters, particularly the young and those in working-class areas, leading to protests at Paris universities including the Sorbonne and Sciences Po, even though 41% of 18-25s – more than 4 million voters – abstained in the first round. The campaign for the 577 seats in the French lower house will begin on 10 May. Macron’s centrist La Republique en Marche (LREM) currently has 263 seats, the conservative opposition Les Républicains, 93; the centrist Moden, 52; the PS, 25 and La France Insoumise just 17. Mélenchon insisted his Union Populaire was leading in 105 constituencies, and that a majority of 290 was “possible”. “If I don’t fight for this victory, what do I do: say ‘go ahead give them all the power’?. I don’t want Mme Le Pen to win the country and I don’t want M Macron to keep power. I say there is a third round. It’s for the French to decide who is the head of government,” he said in an interview last week. Mélenchon would need the support of all France’s leftwing electorate, around 11.8 million of whom voted in the first round, if he stands any chance of a majority in parliament after the elections on 12 and 19 June. Mélenchon has rebuffed suggestions of any alliance with the PS. Manon Aubry, an LFI MEP, spent last week in negotiations with leftwing parties to form an alliance for the legislative elections. “There are obstacles, but there’s a common desire to create a union around a programme,” Aubry told the Observer. Asked about the PS, she added the party would have to drop its “neo-liberal stance”. “We have put a certain number of conditions on the table and the ball is in their court. The question is, are they ready to come towards us?”. Antoine Bristielle, a political analyst and director of the Opinion Observatory at the left-leaning Jean Jaurès Foundation, said Mélenchon had pulled a political masterstroke, learning the lesson of 2017 when he failed to unite the left after the presidential vote. “After 2017, he didn’t succeed in maintaining high-level support for the subsequent elections, and he wants to do it differently this time,” Bristielle said. “He’s trying to consolidate his base support and has realised the way to do this is from a position of force. “It’s not a question of how many MPs he gets but whether he can get the ecologists and communists behind him before the legislative elections, thus creating a political force. I honestly think he doesn’t want the PS to join him; he considers the party doesn’t represent much now and will die on its own, so joining it would be more negative than positive.” Laurent Joffrin, former director of the newspaper Libération, said LFI partners would be expected to “submit” rather than be allies, and have to sign up to Mélenchon’s policies including pulling out of Europe. “These positions are not those of the voters of the non-Mélenchonist left and even less of a more centrist electorate. “This is the eternal problem of the radical left: it has a chance at power but in no way does it want to pull together to achieve it,” Joffrin wrote.",News/World news,"Forget the presidency, I can lead France as its PM, insists Mélenchon",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/forget-the-presidency-i-can-lead-france-as-its-pm-insists-melenchon
4/24/2022,"A Florida bride and her wedding caterer have been criminally charged after serving food laced with marijuana to their wedding guests, sickening them and sending several to hospital. Danya Shea Svoboda, 42, and Jocelyn Montrinice Bryant, 31, who catered her wedding, face charges of violating Florida’s anti-tampering laws, delivery of marijuana and culpable negligence. On 19 February, Seminole county deputies arrived at a community clubhouse where fire rescue personnel were treating multiple wedding guests for “symptoms consistent with that of someone who has used illegal drugs”. Upon asking the bride and groom whether they had consented to or requested any of the food to contain cannabis products, the groom, Andrew Svoboda, “stared at [a deputy] with a blank expression for a few moments before stuttering through a ‘no’,” said their arrest warrant affidavit. Authorities tried to locate the manager of the catering service but found all of the catering staff leaving the premises. They collected used glassware and utensils, as well as food including lasagna, chocolate-covered strawberries and pudding “shots”. Wedding guests who were treated for symptoms reportedly said they felt “high”, “ill”, and “stoned”. One guest who ate the Caesar salad, tortellini and bread with an olive oil and herb dip said he “felt tingly, his heart started to race, and was having crazy thoughts”, adding that he had used marijuana years ago but that this experience “felt different to him”. Another guest who ate the salad, dip and three meatballs said he felt “weird, tingly, fidgety, and had extreme dry mouth”. One guest began vomiting, and another grew paranoid that her son-in-law had died and her family had not told her. One of the guests claimed to have seen the caterer reach into a punch bowl and remove a green substance, saying she could detect a “strong odor of marijuana”. So, according to the affidavit, she asked the caterer if there was marijuana in the food. The caterer “giggled and shook her head yes”, she said; the guest asked “if this was for real” and the caterer repeated “yes”. Several guests went to a hospital, where THC was found in their blood; food samples collected at the wedding also contained THC. According to the affidavit, Svoboda “agreed to and allowed Joycelyn Montrinice Bryant to lace the food she served ... with cannabis unbeknownst to the attendees, many of whom became very ill and required medical attention.” “I don’t know why. I think that is the biggest question on all of our minds in speaking with some of the family members,” one guest told WESH 2. “We want an explanation.”",News/US news,Florida bride and caterer charged after serving marijuana-laced food at wedding,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/23/florida-bride-caterer-charged-marijuana-food-wedding
4/24/2022,"The ridiculous comeback happens so often in the Premiership now, when must we stop calling them ridiculous? Rugby never used to be like this. But yet again we have seen a team seemingly dead and buried rouse themselves from the most hopeless of positions to take a win at the death. Northampton were gone with an hour played, 31-12 down, a Ben Spencer pair of tries surely having won the match for the home team. So Northampton scored four tries in the last 15 minutes. Obviously. Mike Haywood’s try at the death, with Bath down to 13, was awarded only after consultation with the TMO. Just to add to the drama. Technically, Bath finished the match with 12, a yellow card shown to Orlando Bailey for knocking the ball out of Jarno Augustus’s hand after the tackle. Haywood pounced to score at the next breakdown. And so the Saints kept up their chase for the top four, the bonus point taking them ahead of Exeter. How far away such a scenario had seemed. An early Matt Proctor try against the run of play and boded well, but Bath dominated the first half. The wind at the Rec was brisk and capricious. The home side seemed to make better use of it. In particular, Jonathan Joseph, generally looking a million dollars as ever, tormented the visitors with a series of vicious chips. One of these bamboozled Alex Mitchell, and Max Clark was over to draw Bath level. Danny Cipriani, meanwhile, tormented them from more conventional penalties to the corner. Bath won 13 lineouts in the first half to Northampton’s one. On the half-hour, Bath brought in Semesa Rokoduguni to rattle the Saints’ defence. Cipriani could not quite work a clean pass to Will Muir that time, but a few phases later, with Bath’s forwards pretty much on the line, Cipriani and Muir drifted blind. This time the combination was clean. Bath had a lead, which Cipriani extended to 10 with a penalty at the break. Northampton responded with a pair of penalties to the corner, netting themselves a try from Augustus from the second driven lineout. But that comeback was short-lived. Spencer’s quick brace of blindside tries seemed to kill off the contest just shy of the hour. They were echoes of their other tries. First, he went blind from a Bath driven lineout, then he profited from a spinning, swirling up-and-under. Tommy Freeman could not quite judge that one, Muir hacked on, and Spencer dashed to the corner. His conversion from the touchline put Bath 31-12 ahead. Cue comeback. Mitchell knifed through in the 65th minute for the Saints’ third, before his break five minutes later scattered Bath’s defence again. Freeman picked a beautiful line to round Joe Cokanasiga for the bonus point try. James Grayson’s conversion pulled them to within seven. Josh Bayliss was forced off with five to go, but Bath had used all their replacements. Northampton went for the corner, and formed a 12 or 13-man lineout to force the penalty try. Jaco Coetzee saw yellow. With only two minutes remaining, Northampton ran and ran. From a position deep in their 22, they worked their way deep into Bath’s, exploiting the extra men down the left. It seemed as if they had knocked on, when Augustus was scythed down, but Haywood touched down anyway. Luke Pearce consulted his TMO, and it became clear that Bailey’s hand had knocked the ball out of Augustus’s. The try was awarded after all. Another scarcely believable comeback complete.",Sport/Sport,Mike Haywood’s late try seals thrilling comeback win for Northampton at Bath,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/23/bath-northampton-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
4/24/2022,"Antonio Rüdiger will leave Chelsea when his contract expires at the end of the season, with Real Madrid leading the race to sign the centre-back on a free transfer. Chelsea made an unsuccessful attempt to tie Rüdiger down before the sanctions imposed on Roman Abramovich left the club unable to hand out contracts or sign new players. The Stamford Bridge club’s offer was worth more than £200,000 a week but the Germany international turned it down and is expected to make a decision on his next move soon. The prospect of Rüdiger leaving will be a major blow for Thomas Tuchel, who is already set to lose Andreas Christensen on a free transfer. Christensen is also out of contract and the Denmark centre-back is poised to join Barcelona at the end of the season. The situation is likely to force Chelsea’s next owners to spend heavily on Tuchel’s defence this summer. The European champions were keen to keep Rüdiger, who has been one of their best performers this season, and have made several attempts to keep him. However, it has not been possible to agree fresh terms with the 29-year-old, who earns in the region of £90,000 a week, and Chelsea’s inability to act now has convinced Rüdiger to seek offers from elsewhere. The former Roma defender has been able to talk to foreign clubs about a pre-contract agreement since 1 January. Rüdiger’s representatives have held talks with Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain, but Madrid are believed to be favourites. Madrid’s manager Carlo Ancelotti is a fan of Rüdiger and has asked the Spanish club’s hierarchy to sign him. Manchester United are also thought to be monitoring the situation. Rüdiger, who will be absent with a groin injury when Chelsea host West Ham tomorrow afternoon, could be followed out of the door by César Azpilicueta. Barcelona remain interested in Azpilicueta despite the Chelsea captain triggering a one-year extension to his contract by reaching a set number of appearances earlier this season. The uncertainty hanging over their defence increases Chelsea’s need for their takeover to go through soon. The three bidders hoping to buy Chelsea from Abramovich could find out who has been selected as the club’s preferred bidder this week. If Azpilicueta, Christensen and Rüdiger depart then Tuchel will be left with Thiago Silva, Malang Sarr and Trevoh Chalobah as the only centre-backs in his squad. There will be high hopes for Levi Colwill, 19, who has impressed on loan at Huddersfield. But Chelsea, who sold Fikayo Tomori, Marc Guéhi and Kurt Zouma last summer, will need to spend and could revive their interest in Sevilla’s Jules Koundé.",Sport/Football,Antonio Rüdiger to leave Chelsea with Real Madrid favourites to sign him,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/23/antonio-rudiger-to-leave-chelsea-with-real-madrid-favourites-to-sign-him
4/24/2022,"Manchester City did precisely what they wished to do: beat Watford and give Liverpool 24 hours to contemplate a four-point deficit before their Merseyside derby against Everton on Sunday. If the tussle between two supreme sides is the title race’s headline story, this game’s subplot featured a first Premier League hat-trick from Gabriel Jesus The 25-year-old went on to add a fourth which will pique the interest of potential suitors considering he has a year left on his terms and is rumoured to be keen on leaving the Etihad. Such matters are for the close season. The present is all about how City ticked off another match in their tilt at defending the championship for a second time under Pep Guardiola: they now have five left so remain firmly in pole position to do so. Their win over Brighton in midweek may have been nervy until Riyad Mahrez broke the deadlock early in the second half but it was a completely different story against Watford as the irrepressible Jesus required only four minutes to settle them. João Cancelo swept in a cross that reached fellow full-back Oleksandr Zincehenko on the left. The Ukrainian drilled the ball along back into the area, and Jesus stuck a leg out to divert past Ben Foster. The early strike provoked a question: might Watford’s last visit in September 2019, when they were drubbed 8-0 here, find an unwanted echo? City hunted for more. Kevin De Bruyne swung in a pair of corners that hadthose in green in disarray but in a topsy-turvy phase the champions were next to be put under pressure. Cancelo over-dribbled near halfway and ceded the balland allowing Emmanuel Dennis to race towards Ederson before Zinchenko made a second telling intervention, executing a slide-tackle that expertly retrieved the ball: if it had not been perfectly judged a penalty might have been the tariff. Cancelo’s next act was to try a Cruyff turn and be pilfered again – oncemore to his manager’s discernible chagrin. Guardiola’s mood was to brighten, however. De Bruyne’s late season form has had the near-peerless midfielder at his very best. The latest illustration was a dipping parabola that begged for Jesus to head home, which he did with aplomb. City could have been rampant from this juncture but fell asleep. Hassane Kamara initiated a move he would finish, taking a ball from Dennis, a hole punched in the home defence after Rúben Dias was dragged out wide on the left. When Kamara struck Guardiola did the same to the technical area turf: hitting grass with a fist. City were ragged but emotions next took an upswing for those of a sky blue persuasion. Kevin Friend deserves credit for not blowing when De Bruyne went down injured because it allowed Jesus to find Rodri – near to where the Belgian lay – and after a neat chest-down the Spaniard fired in a sweet volley. If Guardiola gave a pep talk at half-time it worked instantly as the contest’s star turn claimed and scored a penalty four minutes after the break. Jesus ran into the area, Kamara failed to track him, and a Foster boot felled the Brazilian. Up he stepped to secure a first treble in the competition, having performed the feat against Shakhtar Donetsk and Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League. Moments later it became a quadruple via a classic free-flowing City move: Sterling twisted in a central area and found Jack Grealish who fed Jesus who in turn sent De Bruyne away down the right before smashing home the return. Manchester City welcome Real Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday, before turning their focus to the title again when they travel to Leeds. Liverpool dare not drop any points when taking on their Merseyside rivals on Sunday: City are focused and are capable of performing even better than the manner of this handsome victory.",Sport/Football,Gabriel Jesus scores four as Manchester City romp to 5-1 win over Watford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/23/manchester-city-watford-premier-league-match-report
4/24/2022,"Last week a familiar figure returned to the main square of the seaside town of Henichesk. Dressed in a three-piece suit, and sporting his familiar goatee and moustache, Vladimir Lenin was back on his pedestal. A statue of the Bolshevik leader had been erected outside the town’s main council building. Flying from the roof were the Russian and Soviet flags. All in time for Lenin’s 152nd birthday on Friday. Henichesk, however, is not in Russia. It is – or was, until Vladimir Putin’s invasion – a sleepy settlement in southern Ukraine. The town of 20,000 people has a house of culture, a long strip of beach and a Vegas-themed hotel. It also has new imperial masters: Russians. They arrived from Crimea on 24 February in armoured vehicles, rolling past a shimmering landscape of lagoons and dunes. One woman was unimpressed “What the fuck are you doing here?” she asked an enemy soldier, in an exchange filmed on a phone. “You’re occupiers! You’re are fascists! You came to my land uninvited.” She then tried to hand him a packet of seeds. “These are so sunflowers will grow when you all lie down here. From this moment you are cursed! You are a piece of shit!” Despite the wishes of its residents, Henichesk may soon become part of a so-called “People’s Republic of Kherson”. According to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Moscow is planning to hold a sham independence referendum in the southern oblast, or province, possibly as early as Wednesday. Grateful local voters will express their desire to “break away” from Ukraine. That, at least, is the script. It is a model Moscow last used in 2014, when it instigated and armed a pro-Russia separatist rebellion in the eastern Donbas region. It staged pseudo-votes in the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk, both of which became “people’s republics”. The Russian army is now seeking to grab further Ukrainian territory and to expand the “republics”. Putin’s fuzzy war aims evolved last week after his unsuccessful attempt to seize Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv. There is now little talk of his original objective: to “de-Nazify” and to “de-militarise” Ukraine and its leadership. Instead, Russian generals speak openly about conquest. The invasion has become a grandiose colonial project to reshape Europe’s map and to steal Ukraine’s coast. The new apparent goal is to create a land corridor stretching from the separatist east along the sea of Azov to Crimea. This would include the Black Sea ports of Odesa and Mykolaiv, future targets once the battle for Donbas is won. The corridor would link up with Transnistria, a breakaway Soviet-style territory in Moldova that is already home to Russian “peacekeepers”. In the meantime, the Kremlin is consolidating control in Henichesk and other southern areas. Its tactics are intimidation, and co-option for those willing to serve Russian interests. Ukrainian officials, activists and journalists are being arrested. Some disappear. In the city of Kakhovka hostages are beaten and tortured with electric shocks in a police station, according to Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman. The new authorities have shut down independent media outlets and turned off Ukrainian TV. They have switched on Russian propaganda channels broadcasting from Crimea. The message: life has improved with the arrival of Russian forces. “We are in an information vacuum,” one resident said. She added that there was no internet for week-long periods. Meanwhile, a purge of Ukrainian politicians is under way. The mayor of Henichesk, Oleksandr Tulupov, was last seen on 9 March. He and his colleagues posed for a photo in the town park next to a statue of Taras Shevchenko, Ukraine’s national poet. It was Shevchenko’s birthday. It is unclear if the mayor has shared the fate of other elected officials who have been abducted. Last month, the Russians hacked Henichesk’s municipal website and announced Tulupov had voluntarily “resigned”. They replaced him with a new mayor, Gennady Sivak, who had lived in annexed Crimea for eight years. In the occupied city of Kherson, Moscow appointed as mayor a Russian deputy from Putin’s ruling United Russia party, Igor Kastsyukevich. Residents told the Observer there had been a full-blown campaign to erase Ukraine’s national identity. Ukrainian flags have been ripped from civic buildings. In Melitopol teachers are being forced to use Russian and to teach the Kremlin’s school curriculum. The authorities have said some may need to be “retrained” in Crimea. Russian “military police” units have destroyed Ukrainian literature and textbooks. The historian Anne Applebaum said the Russian government’s methods in Ukraine were darkly familiar. Today’s Moscow is replicating what Soviet forces did in occupied Poland, the Baltic states and the rest of central Europe in 1939, as well as at the end of the second world war. It was an “eerily precise repeat of the NKVD [Soviet secret police] and Red Army’s behaviour,” she said. She added: “They have lists of people to arrest – mayors, museum directors, local leaders of all kinds. They systematically rape and murder civilians, in order to create terror. They deport other people en masse to Russia, to enhance their own depleted population. They eradicate local symbols – statues, flags, monuments – and put up their own.” Applebaum said there was “one new twist” in Russia’s takeover of southern and eastern Ukraine, now the scene of a brutal battle for the Donbas. “Because modern Russia stands for nothing except corruption, nihilism, and Putin’s personal power, they have brought back Soviet flags as well as Lenin statues to symbolise Russian victory,” she said. Ukraine removed its Lenin statues in 2014, in the wake of the Maidan revolution. Monuments vanished from squares in Kharkiv, Kyiv and elsewhere. Communist slogans were banned under “decommunisation” laws passed by Ukraine’s parliament. Henichesk and other occupied areas are now seeing forced “recommunisation”. Or, put another way, they are going back to the USSR. Yurii Sobolevskyi, a first deputy chairman in Kherson’s regional council, said the Russian “orcs” were putting up communist-era memorials and “moving to the past”. This was taking place against the backdrop of a worsening humanitarian crisis, the strict suppression of dissent and a clampdown on anyone who expressed a pro-Ukrainian political stance, he said. He added: “Their motive is absolutely transparent. They try to parasite on the nostalgic sentiments of the population. The problem is that these almost don’t exist in the [Kherson] area. Our people live in the present and have a very real and successful future. But the occupiers don’t understand. Therefore, the ‘USSR show’ will go on until Ukraine’s armed forces liberate our territory.” Marina – a woman living in the occupied southern port of Berdyansk – said the city’s new overlords were planning to stage a Red Square-style victory parade on 9 May. “It’s like a terrible dream. I was a pioneer and in the Komsomol [communist youth organisation]. I don’t miss Lenin,” she said. “It’s the same scenario here as in the Donbas eight years ago. They’ve come up with nothing new.” Within hours of arriving, the Russians had seized the local TV station and taken over its newspaper, she said. They raided the passport office and stole personal data. Soldiers demanded documents at checkpoints. Russian armoured vehicles marked with a Z drove past regularly, she added. Food was available, but Berdyansk was practically out of medicine. Humanitarian deliveries from Ukrainian-controlled areas had ceased. Most southern residents opposed Russia’s takeover, she said. Nonetheless, the Kremlin has found some locals willing to collaborate. The new “mayor” of Mariupol is a veteran politician from the pro-Russian Opposition Bloc party. Vadym Boichenko, the real mayor, said his counterpart had advised the Russians which infrastructure targets to shell. Collaboration, however, can be dangerous. On Wednesday, Valery Kuleshov, a pro-Russian activist and blogger, was shot dead in Kherson. He had left his apartment block at 8.15am and climbed into his grey Mazda. It’s unclear who raked the front of his car with automatic gunfire. Valery Kim, the mayor of Mykolaiv, said it was impossible to stop patriotic citizens from taking out “traitors”. For now, residents can attempt to travel from Russian zones into Ukrainian-controlled territory. There is no guarantee they will escape. Yulia – a woman from Berdyansk – said soldiers took her uncle from his car and threatened to shoot him in the knee. “They said he was a Nazi,” she said. The doctor husband of a friend of hers was taken away at a checkpoint, she added, and disappeared. Yulia said the popular “mood was against Russia”. This was especially true among younger people. She conceded, though, that Russian TV was beginning to have an effect on pensioners who grew up in the Soviet Union. “My husband’s grandfather told us the Russians weren’t bombing Kharkiv. He watched Russian news. It was difficult to convince him this was a lie,” she said. It seems the Kremlin is not planning to leave southern Ukraine any time soon. A new stamp being used by Berdyansk’s “military-civilian administration” says the port is part of “Russia”. There are plans to replace the Ukrainian currency, the hryvnia, with the rouble – and, ominously, to forcibly conscript men to fight on the Russian side against Ukraine’s army. In his latest video address, President Zelenskiy urged residents in occupied areas to “cause trouble” and said they should not take part in Moscow’s voting “show”. Initially hundreds of pro-Ukrainian protesters took to the streets of Kherson, waving blue and yellow flags. One man stood in front of a tank. Acts of resistance continue. In Melitopol a passer-by tore down a Russian flag. The occupied Melitopol. Ukrainian man tears down Putin’s disgusting tricolor.#StandWithUkraine #ArmUkraineNow #StopRussia pic.twitter.com/fsRWIJ1lFs More recently Russian soldiers have violently dispersed rallies with teargas and live rounds. The protests have become fewer. It is only a matter of time before the “green corridors” allowing locals to flee occupation are closed down. The Russian army has reportedly mined the main road leading north of Kherson, to prevent a Ukrainian counter-attack. Back in Henichesk, the Lenin statue looks set to stay. His unlikely comeback speaks to the ideological vacancy at the heart of Putin’s imperial project on the borderlands of Europe. In an essay last summer, Russia’s president blamed Lenin and his associates for creating Ukraine by making it in 1922 an autonomous socialist republic – an act which deprived Russia, he said, of its “historical lands”. “They don’t understand what they are doing,” Marina from Berdyansk said of her Russian occupiers. “Our local chats were flooded with an invitation to a cultural event celebrating Lenin’s birthday. We didn’t go.”",News/World news,Back in the USSR: Lenin statues and Soviet flags reappear in Russian-controlled cities,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/back-in-the-ussr-lenin-statues-and-soviet-flags-reappear-in-russian-controlled-cities
