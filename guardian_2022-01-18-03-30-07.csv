1/18/2022,"Anthony Martial’s hopes of leaving Old Trafford on loan this month could rest on whether Manchester United are willing to pay a portion of the France striker’s wages, with Sevilla, Juventus and Barcelona all having shown an interest.  Martial, who refuted United manager Ralf Rangnick’s suggestion that he had refused to be part of the squad for Saturday’s trip to Aston Villa, has made no secret of his desire to leave seven years after joining from Monaco in a deal that made him the the most expensive teenager in history. United are believed to want his £150,000-a-week salary covered in full, plus a loan fee. While Tottenham and Newcastle have already made approaches to sign the 26-year-old on loan until the end of the season, it is understood that Martial has no interest in joining another Premier League club on a short-term deal and would prefer to move abroad. Sevilla’s loan bid that would have involved the Spanish club paying half of Martial’s wages was rejected at the end of December and they are believed to be unwilling to cover his entire salary. Juventus have also expressed an interest in signing the player who has made only two Premier League starts this season, while Barcelona are believed to have made initial enquiries as they decide whether to sign another forward. Rangnick, the interim United manager, named only eight substitutes for the 2-2 draw at Villa Park and claimed that Martial’s absence from the travelling party was the player’s choice. “He [Martial] didn’t want to be in the squad,” Rangnick said. “He would have been in the squad normally. He didn’t want to be and that’s the reason why he wasn’t with us.” Martial hit back in a post on his Instagram story on Saturday evening. “I will never refuse to play a match for Man United,” the French forward wrote. “I’ve been here for seven years and I never disrespected, and will never disrespect, the club and the fans.”",Sport/Football,Anthony Martial’s departure hinges on Manchester United paying part of salary,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/17/anthony-martials-departure-hinges-on-manchester-united-paying-part-of-salary
1/18/2022,"The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, has confirmed that the BBC’s funding will be frozen for the next two years – but has softened her stance on the permanent abolition of the television licence fee. The annual levy on television usage will remain at £159 until April 2024, requiring cuts to the BBC’s output. However, it will then rise in line with inflation for the next four years – a better deal than had been proposed in some press briefings from the government.  Dorries also watered down her own suggestion that the licence fee would be abolished from 2028 onwards, raising suspicions that the focus of her provocative intervention on Sunday was to distract from Boris Johnson’s woes. On Sunday Dorries tweeted that the current licence fee settlement “will be the last” and the “days of the elderly being threatened with prison sentences and bailiffs knocking on doors are over”. Yet when formally announcing the BBC funding settlement in parliament on Monday afternoon, her language was notably softer. She insisted no final decision had been made on the future of the licence fee: “It is not a policy, we are announcing a debate and a discussion. The decision as to what the future funding model looks like is up for discussion.” The BBC said rising inflation means that freezing its main source of income for two years “will necessitate tougher choices which will impact licence fee payers”. Some services may have to be closed to make hundreds of millions of pounds in spending cuts. Dorries told parliament that the BBC was a “beacon” of British culture that needed to survive but there should be a debate about how it should be funded in the future. She said she could not envisage “a world in 2028 where individual households are paying an outdated funding fee” based on ownership of a television used for receiving broadcast channels. She also told MPs she did not have any preference on what funding model could replace the licence fee and repeatedly emphasised that she was unlikely to be in her current job when the decision was made: “We haven’t even begun the discussions yet … there are a number of ways I have been told already that we could fund the BBC going forward. It’s not for me to decide until we have all the information and all the evidence.” Dorries also criticised some aspects of the BBC’s output, saying there should be further investigations into the BBC’s “impartiality and groupthink”. She suggested freezing the licence would help with the cost of living, which was welcomed by some Tory MPs in so-called ed Wall seats. However, she also had to contend with several backbench Conservative MPs who spoke up in defence of the BBC – suggesting the politics of cutting the national broadcaster’s budget are not clear cut. In a joint statement, the BBC director general, Tim Davie, and chairman, Richard Sharp, said it was “disappointing” that the funding freeze for the next two years means the BBC will now have to absorb rising costs. With inflation now running at over 5%, the corporation will have to find ways to cut costs or make fewer programmes if it wants to balance its finances. The licence fee is also used to fund Welsh language channel S4C, which will receive an extra £7.5m to boost its online offering as part of the deal. The House of Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, earlier told off Dorries for tweeting out the licence fee announcement rather than announcing it in parliament. He also suggested there was a “major colander right across government” and there might need to be a leak inquiry to find out who briefed her policy to Sunday newspapers: “Any substantial policy developments should have been made to this house before they were made to the media.” Dorries apologised and said she had “refused every invitation for media yesterday and today”. Labour MP Catherine McKinnell later asked if Dorries was “seeking to undermine and sacrifice this great national institution in order to save the prime minister’s political skin”. Dorries replied: “I’m not.”",News/Media,"BBC’s future ‘up for discussion’, says Nadine Dorries, as licence fee frozen",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/17/no-final-decision-made-on-bbc-licence-fee-says-nadine-dorries
1/18/2022,"A former charity worker who worked with released prisoners was stabbed to death by an ex-inmate she had begun a relationship with, a jury has heard. Michaela Hall, 49, was stabbed through the eye by Lee Kendall, 42, in a bedroom of her house in the Cornish village of Mount Hawke, Truro crown court was told. The court heard that Hall, a mother of two, was the victim of a number of assaults before she was killed, but declined to pursue prosecutions against Kendall.  Jurors were told that on the night of the alleged murder, Hall was talking to a friend in Gran Canaria, who heard her screaming as if she was in a “movie” and shouting: “Lee, stop Lee, get off me.” The friend managed to alert the UK authorities and police went to the house three times over the next 24 hours but did not see any sign of a disturbance and did not force an entry. Hall’s father, Peter, finally got a spare key from the landlord and found her body in the bedroom. Jo Martin QC, prosecuting, said Hall had given up her job as an air cabin crew member to move to Cornwall, where her family lived. She had worked for two charities who helped prisoners when they were released from jail. But Martin said: “Sadly, Michaela’s personality type was unsuited for the role. She got too involved and got too close. She genuinely wanted to help, but she could not recognise the importance of professional boundaries.” She was assigned as support worker to Kendall, who had a drug problem, and picked him up from prison when he was freed in March 2019. But a month later she lost her post because it was discovered she had started a relationship with Kendall, who moved into her home. Martin said they had a “complex relationship” and Hall tried to help and save him. But she added: “It wasn’t long before the violence started. She was seen with black eyes on numerous times, but refused to get help. Violence was a routine feature of the relationship.” The police were called on a number of occasions. Kendall admitted some attacks, and was given a three-year community order by a judge. But at the end of May 2021, Kendall allegedly carried out the fatal attack. Martin told the jury: “He killed her by stabbing her through the eye with a knife. There is no doubt that he did kill Michaela Hall.” She said that after he was arrested, Kendall claimed Hall had lunged at him with a knife and she accidentally sustained a stab wound to the eye during the struggle. A postmortem revealed she had other facial and neck wounds consistent with manual strangulation – and Kendall’s DNA was found on her neck. The cause of death was recorded as a stab wound to the eye socket and brain, with other injuries also present. Kendall denies murder and his trial continues.",News/UK news,"Charity worker killed by former inmate she had a relationship with, jury told",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/17/ex-charity-worker-was-killed-by-former-inmate-she-had-a-relationship-with-jury-told
1/18/2022,"Russia has begun moving troops to Ukraine’s northern neighbour Belarus for joint military exercises, in a move likely to increase fears in the west that Moscow is preparing for an invasion. The joint military exercises, named United Resolve, are to take place as Russia also musters forces along Ukraine’s eastern border, threatening a potential invasion that could unleash the largest conflict in Europe for decades.  Social media videos from Belarus appeared to show artillery and other military vehicles arriving on flatbed carriages owned by the Russian state railway company, and Alexander Volfovich, the head of Belarus’s security council, said in a briefing that troops were already arriving before exercises scheduled for February. Some military analysts have suggested Russia could send its forces through Belarus in the case of a broad invasion, effectively stretching out Ukraine’s defences by taking advantage of the two countries’ nearly 700-mile border. Others believe Belarus would not play a serious role in the conflict if Russia were to launch an attack on Ukraine. The Belarusian leader, , has responded to international pressure and isolation by strengthening ties with Russia, giving vocal support for Putin’s military buildup as he receives diplomatic and economic support from the Kremlin to battle western sanctions. He has also abandoned his country’s supposedly neutral stance on the Ukraine conflict and publicly endorsed Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. The exercises are to be held in the west of Belarus, near the borders of Nato members Poland and Lithuania, and its southern flank with Ukraine, Lukashenko said. “Set an exact date and let us know, so we aren’t blamed for massing some troops here out of the blue as if we are preparing to go to war,” he told top military officials. Reports from Russia have also shown more military equipment, including tanks and short-range ballistic missiles, being transported across the country toward Ukraine within the last week. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said before a meeting with her Russian counterpart on Tuesday that she hoped the tensions could be resolved by diplomacy but if not Moscow would pay a “high price” for aggressive acts toward Ukraine. No concrete troop numbers or timeframe have been named for the joint Russia-Belarus exercises, which Putin announced during a summit with Lukashenko in late December. Lukashenko said on Monday that the exact dates in February were still being determined. He said during the briefing that the exercises were needed because of the presence of Nato forces in neighbouring Poland and the Baltic states, as well as Ukraine’s deployment of troops to the border in response to the migrant crisis that he helped create last year. “Why are we and Russia being reproached for holding manoeuvres, exercises and so forth when you’ve come from far away?” said Lukashenko in heated remarks in which he said western countries had stationed nearly 30,000 troops near his country’s borders. “There are some hot-heads calling for war. We hear these statements.” He also echoed aggressive Kremlin rhetoric that may be used to justify a military intervention in Ukraine, claiming that Kyiv was preparing battalions of “radical nationalists”. A Ukrainian official called the remarks manipulative and “part of an information war”. Volfovich said the exercises would involve Belarusian and Russian soldiers training to repel air and land attacks, neutralise enemy saboteurs and practise other manoeuvres. He also played down the significance of their timing, saying that there was “nothing extraordinary” in them because they were announced late last year, according to a report in the state-run Belta news agency. There are signs, however, that Belarus has taken a more active role in its support of Russia in its ongoing conflict with Ukraine and the west. Kyiv initially said it believed a hacking team tied to Belarusian state intelligence may have played a role in a major cyber-attack on government websites late last week, and Russian nuclear-capable bombers have recently flown over western Belarus. Lukashenko has strengthened ties with Putin since 2020, when he launched a bloody crackdown on protests sparked by vote-rigging during presidential elections. He was driven further into international isolation after he grounded a RyanAir flight in order to arrest a critic of his government and helped manufacture a migrant crisis on EU borders, prompting a humanitarian emergency. Belarus adopted an ostensibly neutral position in 2014 and avoided recognising Russia’s annexation of Crimea, but the dynamic has changed considerably as the country has relied more on Russian diplomatic and material support in the last two years.",News/World news,Russia moves troops to Belarus for joint exercises near Ukraine border,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/russia-moves-troops-to-belarus-for-joint-exercises-near-ukraine-border
1/18/2022,"My friend Iain Smith, who has died of a stroke aged 82, was a historian specialising in British colonial history who spent 37 years at the University of Warwick. He combined liberal broad-mindedness and boundless curiosity with an active spirit. Iain was born in Hull to Alexander Smith, a dentist, and his wife, Amy (nee Cheetham). Attending Bootham school, York, he took on board and retained its Quaker values of service for the rest of his life. He served on the board of governors of another Quaker school, Leighton Park, Reading, for many years.  He studied history at Edinburgh University, graduating in 1962, then went to Kenya, Iain went to Kenya to teach in a Quaker school. After a Fulbright scholarship in Wisconsin, he returned to the UK to take a doctorate at Oxford University, finishing in 1969, and then joined the history department at Warwick University, where – interrupted only to run the Vienna Quaker Centre for a year in the 1970s – he remained until retirement. One of Iain’s popular courses was on the history of South Africa from 1885 to 1910. He also wrote a book on the subject, The Origins of the South African War, 1899-1902 (1996), which was praised for objectivity by both English- and Afrikaans-speaking scholars. Other publications included a monograph on Henry Morton Stanley’s last venture, The Emin Pasha Relief Expedition, 1886-1890 (1972), and, in two volumes The Siege of Mafeking (2001). From 1980 to 1995 he was on the council of the Historical Association. One of Iain’s last projects (2003-2007), together with South African historians and funded by the Wellcome Trust, was to create a database for future research on disease and mortality in concentration camps in the South African War. Over the course of his academic career he carried out a wide range of visiting lectureships or fellowships, in Cape Town, Pretoria, Helsinki, Tbilisi (Georgia), Mansfield College, Oxford, and (for the British Council) China. He retired in 2006 as emeritus reader. Iain was warm and enthusiastic and had the ability to state his views plainly without arousing rancour, a rare gift. He was also an outstanding teacher whose concern for his own students often extended well after their time at Warwick. In 1968 Iain married Teresa Halikowska, a Polish student of English whom he met at Oxford. Together they made their home in Leamington Spa a haven for lovers of literature, music and discussion. A music lover, he became chair of the Leamington Music Society. He was also a keen gardener and a lively participant in the weekly meetings of the Solihull Poetry Society. He continued well into retirement to write academic reviews. Teresa died last year.

1/18/2022,"Moderna is aiming to launch a single booster vaccination that will protect against both Covid-19 and flu within two years, its chief executive has said. Stéphane Bancel said that the combined vaccine – which will protect against Covid-19, influenza and RSV, a common respiratory virus – could be available before the winter infectious season in 2023.  “Our goal is to be able to have a single annual booster so that we don’t have compliance issues where people don’t want to get two to three shots a winter,” he said at a panel session at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “The best-case scenario would be the fall of 2023.” Last year, the NHS moved to reassure the public that getting jabs for flu and Covid at the same time did not affect the body’s immune response. The UK government has been encouraging the public to get a third dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, especially those in more vulnerable groups such as older demographics or those with weakened immune systems. Its efforts include launching a nationwide mobile text message campaign on Boxing Day. Bancel has previously said that people may need a fourth shot of a vaccine this autumn as protection from booster shots declines over the coming months. This month, Israel became the first country in the world to offer a fourth dose of the coronavirus vaccine to people aged 60 and over. The US president’s chief medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, also speaking at Davos on Monday, said there was no evidence that repeat booster disease would overwhelm the immune system. “Giving boosters at different times, there is really no evidence that’s going to hinder” immune response, he said. Fauci said the goal should be a booster that induces a response against multiple potential variants. Bancel also said Moderna’s vaccine candidate specifically targeting the Omicron variant of coronavirus has almost finished being developed and will enter clinical development imminently. The US drug company expects to be able to share data with regulatory authorities around March, he added. “The vaccine is being finished,” he said. “It should be in the clinic in the coming weeks. We are hoping in the March timeframe to be able to have data to share with regulators to figure out next steps.” This month, Darius Hughes, the UK chief executive of Moderna, said it would be a “stretch” for a combined flu and Covid vaccine to be available by winter 2023. “Our number one priority for 2022, after getting the right Covid vaccine for the Omicron variant, is to try to really drive forward our flu and RSV programmes to see if we can get a combination, single-dose respiratory vaccine,” he said. “The benefit for the NHS, and all the vaccination services, and ultimately patients, we think, is going to be huge.”",News/Business,Moderna aims to launch single Covid and flu booster jab within two years,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/17/moderna-aims-to-launch-single-covid-and-flu-booster-jab-within-two-years
1/18/2022,"My friend Barrie Hesketh, who has died aged 91, was an actor, writer and artist who in 1966 co-founded the Mull Little theatre on the Isle of Mull in the Inner Hebrides. Barrie and his wife, Marianne, had moved to Mull in 1963 with their three young sons, and were running their home as a guest house. The after-dinner entertainment the couple provided proved popular and, as demand grew, they set about transforming the adjacent cowshed into a small theatre.  For their two-person productions, Barrie found inventive ways to adapt classics. Repertoire included plays by Shakespeare, Chekhov, Strindberg and Shaw, specially commissioned contemporary work by the Scottish writer Iain Crichton Smith, and original material written by the Heskeths. The couple took their productions on tour, across Britain and Europe. Barrie was born in Erdington, Birmingham, the only child of Doris (nee Sutcliffe) and Donald Hesketh, but grew up in the Peak District, where his father ran the village shop in Flash, outside Buxton. Barrie attended Buxton college, excelling in art, then trained as an actor at Central School of Speech and Drama, in London. There, Barrie met fellow student Marianne Richards, and they married in 1954, a year after graduation. His career began in weekly rep, with Caryl Jenner Touring Productions and Manchester Library Theatre Company, and as an actor and presenter for Granada and ABC TV. In 1960 he accepted a position with the Scottish Community Drama Association, in the course of which a visit to Mull inspired the family’s relocation. Among the audience on Mull one evening was the senior tutor at Churchill College, Cambridge, who was so impressed that he invited the couple to spend a term doing whatever they chose to enrich college life. I was an undergraduate there when they arrived in 1979. As a director Barrie was creative, playful, and generous with us, his student cast and crew. In 1983, the Heskeths were both appointed MBE. Following Marianne’s death from cancer in 1984, Barrie was again invited to Churchill College. It was then that he met Philippa Comber, a psychologist and the college counsellor, who became his partner. Having directed a final season on Mull, Barrie left the island in 1986 and joined Philippa in East Anglia. His focus shifted to writing: the autobiographical Taking Off (1997); a collection of unpublished essays, An Actor’s Take on the Psychology of Shakespeare; and plays including a monologue, The New Prometheus (1987), which he performed in New York, Berlin and Cambridge. Barrie and Philippa settled in Manchester in 1999. Communicating his love of Shakespeare, Barrie directed young actors at Altrincham Club theatre during 2003 and lectured in 2016 at Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, in London. A talented and prolific painter, he was still at work in his 80s. When Parkinson’s disease and an associated dementia made daily life increasingly difficult, Barrie moved to a care home in Cheshire in 2018. There, in 2020, he and Philippa married. Barrie is survived by Philippa, his sons, Richard, Nicholas and James, seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.",Arts/Stage,Barrie Hesketh obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/17/barrie-hesketh-obituary
1/18/2022,"He was nowhere and he was everywhere. Etched into the pavement and lingering in the air, each fragile fragment of an atmosphere carrying resentment and relief and quite a bit in between. Melbourne Park is the home of Novak Djokovic’s hubris, the venue at which he won his very first grand slam and has enjoyed the most success of his career to date. His psyche – that controversial soul of his – is seared into the seats at Rod Laver Arena, where he has lifted nine singles trophies but will not chase a 10th this year. Now it feels he has been cast as Voldemort, the Dark Lord who must not be named – at least by pretty much every player who is not Serbian.  Naomi Osaka was the first invited to offer her two cents “Do you believe Djokovic should be playing at the Australian Open this year?” a journalist asked after her opening-round win over Colombian Camila Osorio. “Is my opinion going to help anything?” she replied. The media pressed on. But what did other players think of the situation? “Yeah, I’ll kind of pass on that,” she said. “Thanks, though.” Gaël Monfils simply would not be drawn. Rafael Nadal, the only former champion left in the draw, was a little more expansive. “I think the situation has been a mess,” he said after overwhelming American Marcos Giron – a statement win in his own campaign to reach a record 21 grand slam titles. “He’s not the only one that probably did bad things in that case. There are more [parties] responsible in this terrible situation we’ve faced over the last two weeks, but he’s one of those responsible.” And then: “I don’t want to talk anymore about that.” The Serbian competitors, though, were in the mood for a roasting. Dušan Lajović, who saw off Márton Fucsovics in five sets, said “the way they treated him was terribly wrong”. Laslo Đere, who was knocked out by Denis Shapovalov, lamented a “true catastrophic situation”. “To tell you the truth,” he said, “I think not just Serbians, I think the whole world saw it and they probably will have a new or different opinion about Australia.” Miomir Kecmanović, meanwhile, got busy exacting retribution on behalf of his countryman. “I think it wasn’t handled well and things could have gone so much smoother and better for everybody,” the 77th-ranked 22-year-old said. “It’s definitely terrible that they had to kick him out like that. We said that we’re going to give everything we have, try to avenge him in a way, and make him proud.” Some 24 hours ago Kecmanović was still scheduled to play his opening match against Djokovic under lights on Rod Laver. In the absence of his box-office opponent, he was relegated to 1573 Arena in the afternoon sun, and in front of significantly fewer spectators. A grand total of 104 punters watched him close out the third set against Djokovic’s replacement in the draw, Salvatore Caruso. The Italian had dubbed himself “the most famous lucky loser in the world”. Kecmanović must have felt at least a little lucky too, having advanced to the second round largely because he faced the world No 150 instead of the world No 1. Serbian supporters were few and far between on Monday, a stark contrast to the scenes outside Carlton’s Park Hotel where Djokovic was held ahead of his failed court challenge to have his cancelled visa reinstated for a second time. But there were two men clapping enthusiastically after each point at one end of the court. Up the other end was a group of five, who let out the odd chant and earned a post-match handshake from Kecmanović for their efforts. Less than three hours later Alexander Zverev and Daniel Altmaier were slogging out an all-German contest in his original slot. They entertained a complimentary centre-court crowd. There were no boos or unsavoury commentary; he-who-must-not-be-named was not present. It was in stark contrast to last year’s final. In the minutes after Djokovic beat Daniil Medvedev to the 2021 title, the crowd booed during the presentation ceremony, set off by the Tennis Australia president’s mention of Covid-19 vaccines. Victoria had already endured one of the world’s most gruelling lockdowns and just emerged from a snap second (there have now been six) and vaccination was a hot topic. Djokovic had been a divisive talking point too, having contracted the virus seven months prior at his unsanctioned Adria Tour, featuring a now infamous dance party. The event was branded a super-spreader and curtailed while he had subsequently drawn criticism for sending Tennis Australia some pre-tournament suggestions on how they might improve conditions for the mass of players in hotel quarantine. Monday’s atmosphere was cordial, but it was also heavy with the remnants of a story that simply will not go away, the irritating butt of a cigarette that cannot be disposed off because no one can locate a bin. “I hope that in the future he [Djokovic] will be the best tennis player in history,” Lajović said. “And that this will be only looked at as a setback on his path to be the best tennis player to ever play the sport. This is my opinion, and I don’t think there is more to add to it.”",Sport/Sport,The Djokovic story won’t go away but at Australian Open play must go on ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/17/the-djokovic-story-wont-go-away-but-at-australian-open-play-must-go-on
