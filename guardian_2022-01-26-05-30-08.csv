1/26/2022,"England have been dealt yet another setback in their Six Nations preparations after Joe Marler tested positive for Covid-19 for the second time in two-and-a-half months, raising doubts over his availability for next week’s trip to Scotland.  Eddie Jones was already dealing with the absences of Owen Farrell and Jonny May from this week’s key training camp in Brighton while Courtney Lawes, the favourite to step in as captain, is currently sidelined with a head injury. Marler’s absence now constitutes another sizeable headache for the head coach. The 31-year-old loosehead prop was forced to withdraw from the training camp after recording a positive test on Tuesday morning and immediately going into isolation. According to government guidance, Marler will be able to leave isolation early next week if he can produce negative tests on day five and day six of isolation. If he ends up having to complete the full 10 days, however, that would take him up to midnight the night before the Murrayfield fixture. In that instance there would be little prospect of him featuring. All other players and staff tested negative and Jones has opted against calling up a replacement into camp, with Ellis Genge and Bevan Rodd the other looseheads in the squad, but England have been given a sharp reminder of the risks still posed by Covid-19. Marler missed England’s autumn victory over Australia after testing positive but was able to rejoin the squad the following Friday and take his place on the bench for the 27-26 win over South Africa 24 hours later. On Tuesday night Marler wrote on social media, “Covid can eat shit … But it does mean I can go back to my diet of chillis and onions.” As was the case in the autumn, England are understood to be well over the 85% target for fully vaccinated players and members of staff. Even if Marler is available for the trip to Murrayfield, his absence for this week’s training camp means further upheaval for Jones, who just this week has been denied more than 300 caps’ worth of experience as he sets about plotting what would be only a second win over Scotland in five years. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the threat of Covid still looms large over the tournament. Antoine Dupont is among eight players missing from the France squad due to positive Covid-19 tests. That number includes the Castres hooker Gaetan Barlot, who lined up against Marler in his side’s Champions Cup defeat by Harlequins on Friday. In addition, Wales announced on Tuesday that Christ Tshiunza had tested positive. Meanwhile, May is due to see a specialist this week to determine if he will play any part in the tournament after withdrawing from camp with a knee injury on Monday. The 31-year-old will miss at least the Scotland match and the trip to Italy the following week but the Gloucester head coach George Skivington is hopeful he will return before the end of the championship in mid-March. “The hope is that he will still play in the Six Nations,” he said.",Sport/Sport,England suffer another Six Nations blow as Joe Marler tests positive for Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/25/england-suffer-another-six-nations-blow-as-joe-marler-tests-positive-for-covid
1/26/2022,"As Boris Johnson prepares to face possibly his most difficult day in politics, Tory MPs said his fate was “hanging in the balance”. Two tumultuous months could come to a head with the publication of a report by the senior civil servant Sue Gray, whose gathering of evidence and interviewing of key witnesses for her inquiry into Downing Street parties could provide the spark for a leadership challenge.  Arch-critics of the prime minister are hopeful that Gray’s findings will be damaging enough to trigger what they believe will be the final trickle of letters needed to get to 54 and force a no confidence vote. One said: “No 10 has shifted the goalposts so far now, but it’s clear Johnson misled the House when he assured us no rules were broken in Downing Street. There’s no chance many others will be able to escape that conclusion.” Another was confident that colleagues would take the choice to “end this nightmare ourselves” and when asking themselves “how much they are willing to put up with”, decide this week that inaction was “not sustainable”. In a bid to head off the rebellion to remove him, Johnson was holed up for three hours in his Commons office on Tuesday afternoon, joined by some of those ministers closest to him, such as the home secretary, Priti Patel. About 10 backbenchers were summoned to see him throughout the afternoon, including the former Commons leader Andrea Leadsom; the MP for Shipley, Philip Davies; and the “2019ers” Dehenna Davison and Greg Smith. “He wasn’t remorseful or downbeat,” a source noted with surprise. In a move that is said to have strained tensions with the government whips’ office, a “parallel operation” to prop up the prime minister has been set up by those loyal to him. Sources named the key instigators as the transport secretary, Grant Shapps; the housing minister Christopher Pincher; and Chris Heaton-Harris, a former whip recently given a key Brexit role in the Foreign Office. Reports over the weekend said they had drawn up their own spreadsheet to keep track of which colleagues were swinging against the prime minister. A senior Tory insider said the group had frequently dipped into the whips’ office this week to feed back their latest intelligence, putting some whips’ noses out of joint. If Johnson survives the immediate aftermath of the Gray report, one of the plans being considered to salvage his leadership is the “abolition of the Carrie faction” in No 10, according to one ally. They said an overhaul of the Downing Street operation was key to regaining the confidence of backbenchers, and therefore those said to be aligned with the prime minister’s wife could be axed given the concerns about her influence. Among those who could end up in the firing line are Simone Finn – a Tory peer who is deputy chief of staff in No 10 – as well as two political advisers in Johnson’s private office, Henry Newman and Henry Cook. Whether he can avoid a vote of no confidence is “in the balance”, said one Conservative who was yet to submit a letter. Others admitted they were “still considering” whether to do so. “It all rests on what Sue Gray says,” was a familiar refrain among anxious Tories, uncertain about whether they should commit regicide. Tory insiders pushing for a vote of no confidence admitted they still faced a challenge, describing it as like “herding duplicitous cats”. Andrew Murrison, a Conservative former minister, said he would read Gray’s “long-awaited” report with a “great deal of interest”. “A lot of my colleagues will value the objective analysis of the facts,” he told the Guardian. “I’m going to go into this with an open mind, will read it cover to cover and form a view.” Regardless of the reported imminent publication of Gray’s findings, several MPs were still confident the investigation opened by the Metropolitan police on Tuesday afternoon would make it politically impossible for Johnson to continue. “Scotland Yard will be handing out plenty of fines,” one said. “Everyone in Downing Street will be calling their lawyers.” A second said: “Even if the rozzers only charge Boris £100, it’s still evidence of wrongdoing.” A third added that even if Johnson escaped direct blame, the concerns about his personality and style of governance would not go away, saying: “A leopard can’t change its spots.” Even though the Metropolitan police’s inquiry could take significantly longer than Sue Gray’s, some wavering Tories conceded it was a big blow to Johnson’s denial of wrongdoing, because it appeared to suggest the Cabinet Office had uncovered evidence of criminality. “It’s absolutely nuclear, and the prospect of a binary outcome is much more dangerous than a civil service probe which simply examines the facts,” said one MP who was considering putting in a letter of no confidence. They said that if Johnson did not step down, the Conservatives would get a “panning” in May’s local elections, with a drawn-out police investigation lasting months keeping up the attention on alleged rule-breaking parties. There were notably more Tory MPs in the Commons chamber who spoke in support of Johnson on Tuesday. Giles Watling called an urgent question on the issue a “vexatious waste of everybody’s time”; Lia Nici insisted constituents were “sick and tired of listening to this constant thread”; and Shailesh Vara encouraged colleagues to focus on “matters that really affect our constituents on a day-to-day basis”. However, Chris Bryant, a Labour MP and chair of the standards committee, said: “Every time a Tory MP brays about the irrelevance of the PM’s rule-breaking, they write their own P45.”",News/Politics,‘In the balance’: divided Tories weigh up PM’s position before Sue Gray report,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/25/divided-tories-weigh-up-boris-johnson-future-sue-gray-report
1/26/2022,"The 48 hours before Cressida Dick’s bombshell announcement of a criminal investigation into “partygate” was intense, busy and momentous for the leadership of the Metropolitan police. It was only on Sunday that the Met decided it had enough evidence to merit a criminal investigation into claims of parties in Downing Street and Whitehall, attended by those who made the onerous lockdown rules.  Discussions at the top of the Met continued throughout Monday, and it was only on Tuesday morning, just before Dick’s announcement before the London assembly, that the scope of those criminal inquiries was decided by the force. That included decisions about which “events” it would investigate, and which it would not. Ever since Sue Gray’s inquiry started unearthing evidence of wrongdoing, the top civil servant’s team have been sharing information with the police. By last week, the picture of alleged law-breaking it painted was becoming clearer. By Sunday 23 January, the Met assessed the evidence potentially showed “clear and flagrant” breaches, by people who should have known their actions were breaking the rules, and who were unlikely to have a reasonable excuse for their actions. In short, the breaches, based on the evidence gathered by Gray’s team, looked clearcut. Ever since media revelations started in December, the Met has been under fire for its decision not to investigate. Some felt it was hiding behind a policy of not usually investigating Covid rule breaches retrospectively. With each revelation and grudging government admission about parties, the Met’s insistence it was not scared of tangling with those in power was increasingly doubted. Breaches of Covid rules normally result in a fine. But since they were first introduced in March 2020, the rules have changed more than 70 times. Thus the starting point for the Met special inquiry team who are now investigating is establishing what laws were actually in place. Then they will be looking for any physical evidence Gray may have acquired, such as CCTV showing who was where at certain times, data from security cards also showing the locations of individuals, and emails. Acquiring photos from mobile phones may also help speed up matters. On Tuesday Dick hinted Gray may already have strong evidence of wrongdoing: “I don’t anticipate any difficulty in obtaining the evidence that it is ... necessary, proportionate and appropriate for us to obtain in order to get to the right conclusions.” Any fines issued via fixed penalty notices can be paid immediately, or an individual can fight them at a magistrates court. Those who pay up do not get a criminal record, but those who choose to fight the matter in court risk getting one if magistrates decide they should. One senior police insider said the Met’s strategy had been to wait for the official inquiry’s emerging findings to be shared with them before deciding to launch its own investigation: “It would be wise to wait for Sue Gray.” One reason for this was that it would prove embarrassing if the Met started an investigation into Johnson’s closest officials, if not the prime minister himself, and then Gray concluded nothing seriously wrong had taken place. Another factor has been the Met’s past experiences of painful run-ins with politicians – to which Dick has had a ringside seat. The first sitting prime minister to be questioned as part of a criminal investigation was Tony Blair, over claims donations to Labour led to honours and peerages. When the time came for Blair to be spoken to, his aides reportedly let the Met know he would resign if they insisted on interviewing him under criminal caution. The Met relented, according to senior sources with knowledge of the police’s thinking. The cash for peerages inquiry collapsed in July 2007 without charges being brought and with Labour politicians furious at the Met. Dick’s friend, John Yates, carried out the investigation and felt politicians tried to flay him alive for his decision to pursue the allegations. The next year it was the Conservatives’ turn. In 2008 the then Labour Home Office felt secrets were being leaked to the Tory immigration spokesperson Damian Green. Because of a potential risk to national security, the investigation was led by the then assistant commissioner Robert Quick, the head of counter-terrorism. His deputy was Dick. The Tories were furious when Green was arrested in 2008 and his office raided. The Met were left red-faced when no charges followed. Quick felt parts of the Tory-supporting press dug up dirt on him as payback and that he was a marked man. He resigned in 2009 after sensitive papers he was holding were photographed by a long lens as he arrived in Downing Street. Asked recently if the experience may have affected Dick’s appetite for investigating the politically powerful, Quick quipped: “She saw what happened to me.”",News/UK news,Met’s ‘partygate’ inquiry is latest run-in between police and politics,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/25/met-partygate-inquiry-latest-run-in-police-politics
1/26/2022,"It’s hard to really blame Emily (Aubrey Plaza) for choosing a life of crime. A low-paid service gig brings nothing but stress. A seemingly inescapable student loan is gathering interest by the day. A couple of minor, years-back criminal charges have closed off a world of employment. It’s a familiar predicament that plagues many in America and even though first-time writer-director John Patton Ford might only show it in the broadest of strokes, it’s an effectively infuriating set-up.  When Emily is offered an opportunity for an extra income, she nervously inches down the rabbit hole. It starts off simple. She’s given a cloned credit card and has to buy a TV. She then takes it to her new bosses and gets paid $200. It’s easier than she anticipated and soon she’s doing it on the regular, edging closer to taskmaster Youcef (Theo Rossi) who slowly becomes more than her mentor. But how far is she willing to go? Emily the Criminal is mostly as straightforward as its title, a punchy, pared-down little thriller about a woman rising in confidence as she falls deeper into a criminal underworld. Contemporary nods to gig economy aside, it’s a tale as old as time, of someone spurned by the system they once followed, that little voice telling them to stop gradually being silenced and while Patton Ford isn’t trying to excuse Emily, he’s keen to try to explain her. From the stark opening scene, as a job interview turns to mulch in front of her, we see not just a barely contained frustration but a simmering fury, and every time there’s another ignominy, no matter how tiny, it chips away, pushing her closer to a world free from the same rules that have kept her trapped. There are some fantastically charged moments of suspense – Emily trying to buy a car and drive away before the bank is called, a genuinely jolting confrontation with a double-crossing client – and Patton Ford has a knack for making us sweat without relying on an over-egged score or over-stacked stakes. It’s a genre movie with its feet firmly on the ground, small in scale and tight in focus. Plaza, an actor with a history of bringing out her finest work at Sundance (from The Little Hours to Black Bear to a career-best turn in Ingrid Goes West), is incredibly engaging here, a rare dramatic role that demands only the tiniest moments of comedy. The script, which at times can be a little rushed, requires some major leaps for the character but she works hard to make us buy them, never urging us to agree with what she’s doing and how she’s doing it but never causing us to second-guess her. There’s also a crackling chemistry with Rossi even if some of his crime world plotting gets a little thin as the film hurtles toward a finale of no return. If Patton Ford doesn’t quite stick the landing – a late-stage backstory reveal is pretty limp, the final scene a little underwhelming – the journey there is more than worth it, an on-form Plaza drawing us close even when he briefly loosens his grip. It’s an undeniably striking debut, slick and involving enough to have us curiously excited for whatever he decides to do next.

1/26/2022,"Bradford council has been stripped of control of its children’s social care after an investigation following the murder of 16-month old Star Hobson found serious shortcomings in the management of the service. Social workers will be transferred to a not-for-profit children’s trust that ministers hope will help “drive rapid improvements” to a department which has been underperforming for years and struggled to raise its game.  Star was beaten to death by her mother’s girlfriend in September 2020 after months of abuse. Despite several warnings from family and friends and five visits to the family home by social workers and police officers, no appropriate safeguarding action was taken. Savannah Brockhill, 28, of Bradford, was jailed in December for at least 25 years for the murder of Star, while her mother, Frankie Smith, 18, received eight years for causing or allowing the death of a child. A local safeguarding practice review into the lessons of why more was not done to safeguard Star – originally expected this month – has now been wrapped into a wider national review looking also at the murder of six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes in Solihull. This is now due to report in May. Ministers decided to transfer Bradford’s social care services into arms-length trust on Tuesday after publishing a three-month review of the department’s management and governance carried out by Bradford’s government-appointed commissioner, Steve Walker. The executive summary of the report published by the Department for Education (DfE) suggests Walker did not look specifically at shortcomings relating to the Star Hobson case, but more broadly at longstanding management and governance issues within Bradford children’s services. Walker found that attempts to improve the services after it was rated inadequate by Ofsted inspectors in October 2018 had been sluggish and unconvincing, undermined by inexperienced management and acute shortages of permanent social workers. An overhaul of the department had been launched in 2019 but this failed, with the plan criticised by Walker for its complexity and focus on management process rather than safeguarding practice. He concluded it lacked capability to improve services speedily enough and recommended an “alternative delivery model” be introduced. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi’s, decision to create a children’s trust in Bradford is the eighth time a failing children’s social services department has gone down this route since 2010. In some cases, trust status has led to improved services, such as in Sunderland, but it has struggled to make an impact elsewhere, as in Northamptonshire and Sandwell. Zahawi said: “It’s clear from the recommendations made by the commissioner in Bradford that the council needs support to improve and so I’m pleased that Bradford council have agreed to establish a new trust that will bring positive change for the council and independent oversight that drives improvements.” However, Ray Jones, emeritus professor of social work at Kingston University, said setting up a trust meant that for two years management energy would be directed into creating the new body rather than addressing safeguarding practice issues. “The trust model is not a quick fix, and may not be a fix at all,” he said. The DfE said an independent non-executive commissioner will be appointed to lead the council while the children’s trust is set up. The trust will be fully-owned by the council but will operate independently under a new board of directors.

1/26/2022,"Three asylum seekers brought a case to the high court on Tuesday claiming that the home secretary operated a secret, blanket policy to seize mobile phones from people arriving on small boats and then download the data from them. The unpublished policy for the handover of the new arrivals’ phones operated between April and November 2020. It is likely to have involved the confiscation of thousands of mobile phones, the court heard.  Opening the case, a judicial review, Tom de La Mare QC, representing one of the three asylum seekers, referred to as HM, told the court that after Home Office officials seized their phones they were “bullied” into handing over their pin numbers so that officials could unlock personal information including emails, photos and videos and download them to an intelligence database called Project Sunshine. He added that those who had their phones confiscated on arrival in the UK were given a receipt containing a Home Office phone number to call to try to retrieve their phones. Many waited several months before getting their phones back. “They were simply given a number which, evidence is unchallenged, was never answered,” he said. The court heard that HM lost contact with his wife and child due to no longer having his phone to call them. “He didn’t know if they were alive or dead,” said de La Mare. He was unable to call his loved ones to say he had arrived safely in the UK because he did not have his phone, nor the numbers stored in it. He accused the Home Office of “serious illegality” in operating the policy in “complete secrecy”. He said that the number of phones confiscated during several months in 2020 before lawyers started to investigate what was happening was probably thousands. He added that initially the Home Office denied the existence of this policy but later confirmed it. It was “evidence of the chaos that was prevailing”, he said. The three asylum seekers bringing the case all claim they had their phones seized between April and September 2020. One has been recognised as a potential victim of trafficking. They claim their phones were taken almost immediately after they arrived, before they could take a note of the contact details stored in the phones. The three asylum seekers claim that the Home Office’s policies of seizing phones, taking pin numbers and extracting data is unlawful, because the government does not have any legal power to do this with newly arrived asylum seekers, “who are the most vulnerable in society”. They also say the policies were unlawful because they operated in a blanket fashion, were unpublished and breached human rights and data protection laws. Privacy International, an organisation that specialises in data and privacy issues, has been granted permission to intervene in the case.

1/26/2022,"MPs and anti-corruption experts have warned that the UK government must not delay long-awaited measures to tackle economic crime, after a minister resigned over the government’s failure to prevent more than £4.3bn in fraudulent claims for Covid business loans. Lord Agnew dramatically quit on Monday as a minister at the Treasury and Cabinet Office with oversight of fraud prevention, in another blow to the embattled prime minister. In a resignation letter to Boris Johnson, published on Tuesday, Agnew revealed that in a decision apparently taken last week, a key piece of legislation, the economic crime bill, had been rejected for consideration during the next parliamentary year. He described the decision as “foolish”.  The bill was expected to bring forward measures, among others, to improve almost nonexistent oversight of the UK’s business register, Companies House, and finally bring in a public register of beneficial ownership of property – revealing the individuals behind offshore companies used to hold valuable UK homes and land. Tougher laws on fraud and changes to McMafia-style legislation to target the unexplained wealth of kleptocrats were also expected. Responsibility for planning bills to be included in the annual Queen’s speech at the start of each parliamentary session lies with Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the house and head of the parliamentary business and legislation committee. Robert Palmer, executive director of Tax Justice UK, a campaign group, decried the decision to “kick anti-corruption legislation into the long grass yet again”. “We need stronger rules to deter the rich and powerful from dodging tax or hiding their wealth. British companies can still be used to funnel dirty money through the UK.” Many of the measures expected in the bill have cross-party support, and the prime minister on Tuesday told the House of Commons that the government was bringing forward a “register of beneficial interest” as part of its efforts to “track down Russian money in this country”, amid concerns Russia could invade Ukraine. Andrew Mitchell, a Conservative MP and former minister who has campaigned for transparency measures to clean up what has become known as the “London Laundromat”, warned against further delay. “Any backsliding, particularly at a moment like this, would be hugely regrettable,” Mitchell said. Campaigners have long highlighted the UK’s role in laundering the proceeds of global financial crime and the looting of states with high levels of corruption. Property in London and the south-east of England is particularly prized. Agnew resigned after highlighting the huge levels of fraud detected in the UK’s Covid-19 business support schemes after the government decided to write off £4.3bn in loans thought to be fraudulent. Many of those loans were claimed by fraudulent shell companies registered in the UK. Money laundering and other forms of financial crime are made easier by the UK’s relatively lax approach to checking companies, after changes in 2011 under then business secretary Vince Cable to make it quicker to register a company online. Companies House infamously acknowledges at the top of its website that it “does not verify the accuracy of the information filed”. That has left it wide open to abuse. “Adolf Tooth Fairy Hitler” was registered as a company director until apparently resigning on 31 December, while one of the few prosecutions for fraudulent information on Companies House was of a Warwickshire businessman who had openly created a company under Cable’s name to prove how open the system was to fraud. It costs only £12 to set up a company in the UK. Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP who has campaigned persistently for tougher measures on financial crime, has called for that cost to be increased to a “still cheap” £50, a move that would massively increase Companies House’s resources. For years, the government has resisted reforming Companies House. The Covid loans fiasco shows it was wrong to do so, say campaigners. UK companies are not just used for money laundering by bad actors in far off foreign countries, but here in Britain, on an industrial scale. Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute, a thinktank, said: “The weak governance and toothless powers of Companies House enable fraud and economic crime around the world, and right here in the UK. The government’s failure to address this has been brutally exposed by the large-scale Covid loan frauds – money stolen from UK taxpayers as a result of indifference and negligence at the heart of government.” Duncan Hames, director of policy at Transparency International UK, said shelving the reforms would allow even more illicit wealth into the UK. “With criminals exploiting some of the same weaknesses used to funnel dirty money into Britain, clearly a reformed Companies House could have played a key role in preventing the mountain of Covid loan fraud that has left the public billions out of pocket,” he said. Hodge said further delay to the economic crime bill would be a “serious betrayal by this government”. They cannot kick the can down the road any longer without economic crime causing further untold damage,” she said. A government spokesperson said: “We remain committed to tackling economic crime. “We’re already taking action on multiple fronts to crack down on anyone who has sought to exploit our Covid-19 support schemes. “This includes investing over £100m in a taxpayer protection taskforce made up of nearly 1,300 staff – which is expected to recover an additional £1bn of taxpayer’s money.”",News/Law,Pressure grows on UK to beef up measures to tackle economic crime,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/25/pressure-grows-on-uk-to-beef-up-measures-to-tackle-economic
1/26/2022,"While some members of the cabinet have been conspicuous by their absence when it comes to defending Boris Johnson against spiralling allegations, he is not without a praetorian guard of allies gamely trying to bat for him on the airwaves, social media and elsewhere. As the Conservative leader faces continuing calls for his resignation from his own benches and the opposition, and is now confronted with a police investigation into alleged lockdown parties at No 10, here are some of those defenders (to varying degrees):  Nadine Dorries The pugilistic culture secretary posted on Twitter in characteristic style after it emerged that a birthday party had been thrown for Johnson in the middle of the first lockdown, wondering aloud if what transpired could be “called a party”. The response was seen as a riposte to senior Tories who had called for Johnson’s head after the latest revelations on ITV News. In an appearance on Channel 4 News on 13 January, she tried to claim that Rishi Sunak had been slow to back Johnson when the latter faced a grilling at prime minister’s questions because of what she claimed was the poor wifi signal in Ilfracombe, Devon, which the chancellor was visiting that day. So, when people in an office buy a cake in the middle of the afternoon for someone else they are working in the office with and stop for ten minutes to sing happy birthday and then go back to their desks, this is now called a party? Jacob Rees-Mogg Attempting to defend Johnson in a BBC Newsnight interview earlier this month, Rees-Mogg exacerbated the damage to Tory party unity when he described Douglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives and a flag-carrier for the rebellion, as “a lightweight figure”. When news broke on Tuesday morning that the Metropolitan police had initiated a formal investigation into “partygate”, Rees-Mogg immediately placed himself in front of camera crews outside of No 10 after the cabinet held its weekly meeting. “The leadership of this country that Boris Johnson has had, has been so brilliant that he has got us through this incredibly difficult period,” he said. Nadhim Zahawi The education secretary was front and centre during media interviews on Monday as the government and Tory party responded to allegations by the former Conservative minister Nusrat Ghani that she was sacked for being Muslim. “The important thing to remember, in my view, is that this is a prime minister who doesn’t, you know, look at your background, your religion or anything else. He looks at your ability,” Sky News was told by Zahawi, who was picked by Johnson in late 2020 to be the vaccines minister and then promoted in September to be education secretary. Dominic Raab The deputy prime minister and justice secretary was an assertive early defender of Johnson last month when the first details of potential lockdown breaches at Downing Street emerged. Those in attendance at a gathering in the garden at 10 Downing Street with wine and cheese in May 2020 were “predominantly in formal attire”, said the former lawyer. On Sunday, Raab refused to confirm that the Sue Gray report on alleged Downing Street parties would be published in full, saying the amount of detail released publicly would be a matter for Johnson. Grant Shapps A central figure in the prime minister’s fightback, if reports that Johnson wanted to “get the old gang back” by assembling those who played a role in his leadership campaign are anything to go by. Shapps is said to have dusted off the spreadsheet used in that campaign to try to map out the degrees of hostility and sympathy among MPs, allowing Johnson to attempt to rally support. But a response by Shapps that he was “not seeking to defend” the latest allegations in a BBC Radio 4 Today programme interview on Tuesday left some wondering if he really was Johnson’s ‘most loyal lieutenant’. Liz Truss Though tipped as a frontrunner in the event of a Tory leadership contest, the foreign secretary has been visibly more supporting of her boss than her rival Sunak. Conor Burns While not a member of the cabinet, the Northern Ireland minister used a slightly more unusual turn of phrase to defend the prime minister in an interview with Channel 4 News on Tuesday. “It was not a premeditated, organised party,” he said to the presenter Cathy Newman. “He was, in a sense, ambushed with a cake.” ""He was ambushed with a cake.""A Conservative MP says that a birthday celebration held in Downing Street for Boris Johnson wasn't a ""premeditated party"".Conor Burns tells @cathynewman that he supports Boris Johnson and that ""the public will ultimately judge"". pic.twitter.com/EGy0lcxXLA",News/Politics,Solid or tepid?
