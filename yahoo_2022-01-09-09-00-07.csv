1/9/2022,"CALI, Colombia (AP) — For the first time in years, Víctor Escobar stopped taking most of the medicines needed for his lung disease. There was no longer any need. On Friday evening, he became the first Colombian to be euthanized despite not yet being in terminal condition. “I feel an immense tranquility. I don't feel fear of what is to come,"" Escobar told The Associated Press this week. ""They have told me that the process is going to be a slow sedation at first so that I have time to say goodbye. “After that is the injection of the euthanasia, which is going to be something without pain — a very tranquil death. I trust in God that that all this will be that way,” he said in a weak voice while sitting on a sofa in the small home he had been paying off with a pension of $250 a month. His lawyer, Luis Giraldo, said Friday evening that the process had been completed and Escobar was dead. Escobar was the first to use a July ruling of the nation's top court that changed the rules for euthanasia, allowing it to be applied to people who suffer intense physical or psychological suffering due to a grave and incurable disease, even if they are not yet near death. His family declined to reveal the name of the clinic where the euthanasia took place. The country depenalized euthanasia in 1997, but only for those considered to have fewer than six months to live. While polls indicate most Colombians favor expanding it to people like Escobar, the legislature so far hasn't formally followed the court's lead by explicitly authorizing it and some remain deeply opposed. The Catholic Church issued a statement in July saying that “any action or omission with the intention of provoking death to overcome pain constitutes homicide.” From the apartment in Cali, where he was born, Escobar was conscious of the importance of his case, the first in Latin America. “It is the door so that a patient like me, with degenerative diseases, has the opportunity for a dignified death,” he said Thursday. Even morphine was insufficient to calm his pain and he said other medications were losing their effects. He had been ill since 2008, when two strokes cost him the movement of half his body, though some of that returned. He later developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, severe arthrosis and costochondral junction syndrome — a painful inflammation where the ribs meet the breastbone. Escobar fought to obtain euthanasia for more than two years. Judges twice turned him down because his illnesses were not yet considered terminal. “It was a complicated affair to confront justice, the political parties, religion and many powerful people as somebody who only had (access to) communications media,,” said Giraldo, his attorney. In an earlier case, a judge in October had authorized voluntary euthanasia for Martha Sepúlveda, a woman suffering amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. But it was cancelled hours before the planned procedure when extensive news coverage led the medical committee at the clinic where it was to be performed to change its mind. Escobar said he would say farewell to his wife, three children, brother and cousins at a midday meal. “I will have the opportunity that they give me the warmth of the family and their accompaniment and also that I can thank them in my own name,"" he said. “It will be a day of rejoicing for us, and I hope it will be something very private.” Escobar said he hoped his case would lead to actual legalization and regulation of assisted death for non-terminal patients. Legislation to do so failed in November. “If we ask for a dignified death it is because we are tired of all the illnesses that overcome us,"" Escobar said. “For us, life ended a long time ago.”",World/Associated Press,Colombian man felt tranquil before euthanasia ended his pain,https://news.yahoo.com/colombian-man-feels-tranquil-euthanasia-173431837.html
1/9/2022,"Dave Ramsey, personal finance radio host and outspoken evangelical Christian, was the target of social media criticism Saturday, as outraged individuals slammed him for saying that if tenants at his residential properties are displaced because he raised rental rates to meet market price, it does not make him “a bad Christian.” Ramsey, who hosts the nationally syndicated three-hour radio program and podcast “The Ramsey Show,” is once again the center of controversy, this time for these words about tenants forced from buildings that he owns because of rent increases: “The ratio of the income that they earned to their housing expense displaced them,” Ramsey said on the air. “I didn’t cause any of that. And so you are not displacing them, you’re taking too much credit for what’s going on. If they need to move to a cheaper house, because they can’t afford they’re gonna move to a lesser house because if they move they’re gonna pay market rent. Okay, I own rental property, single family homes, among many other properties that we own. And if I raised my rent to be market rate that does not make me a bad Christian. I did not displace the person out of that house if they can no longer afford it.” Ramsey’s comment caused enough outrage — or at least, strong opinions — to make him a trending topic on Twitter on Saturday, racking up more than 5,000 tweets on the matter.

1/9/2022,"PAHRUMP, Nev. (AP) — The woman dubbed the “Hollywood Madam” when she was accused in the mid-1990s of running a Los Angeles prostitution ring said she is moving out of a southern Nevada town where she has lived for about 15 years. Heidi Fleiss told the Pahrump Valley Times she is angry that someone shot one of her cherished pet parrots with a pellet gun just before Christmas. Fleiss told the newspaper she contacted Nye County Animal Control officers and kept the pellet that a veterinarian removed from the bird’s leg as evidence. She said she would pay up to $5,000 for information leading to the arrest of the shooter. Fleiss said she bought a property in Missouri, where she plans to relocate her exotic bird collection by the end of February. Fleiss, 56, has lived for about 15 years in Pahrump, a high desert community about 60 miles (96 kilometers) west of Las Vegas. Her pandering conviction was overturned in California, but she served 20 months of a federal prison sentence for a 1996 tax evasion conviction. She later moved to southern Nevada with a menagerie of parrots, and was a close friend of Dennis Hof, owner of several legal brothels in Nevada and star of the HBO adult reality series “Cathouse.” Hof ran for state Legislature in 2018.

1/9/2022,"Kyle Rittenhouse's friend, who bought him an assault-style rifle when he was only 17, has agreed to plead no contest to contributing to the delinquency of a minor, a non-criminal citation, and avoid convictions on the two felonies he'd been facing. Dominick Black, 20, was charged in November 2020 with two counts of delivering a dangerous weapon to a minor, resulting in death. The two counts related to Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, the protesters Rittenhouse fatally shot the night of Aug. 25, 2020, in Kenosha. Black was 18 when he purchased the Smith & Wesson M&P 15 rifle for Rittenhouse at a hardware store in Rusk County in May that year. At 17, Rittenhouse was too young to legally purchase the weapon. In August 2020, Rittenhouse used it to kill two people and wound a third during protests in Kenosha. In November, a jury found him not guilty, based on his claim of self-defense. Black was the first prosecution witness at Rittenhouse's trial, but the status of his own charges were up in the air after Judge Bruce Schroeder agreed to throw out one of the charges against Rittenhouse — that he unlawfully possessed a firearm as a minor. The defense convinced Schroeder that an exception in the law allows 17-year-olds to possess rifles and shotguns, or at least left the law too vague to be enforceable. Black's attorney, Anthony Cotton of Waukesha, had made the same argument for dismissing Black's case. Schroeder is also the judge on Black's case, which is set for a hearing Monday morning. On Friday, Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger filed a proposed plea agreement. It suggested Black would plead no contest to a pair of citations, and pay a $2,000 fine, and the felony counts would be dismissed. The proposed deal was first reported by kenoshacountyeye.com. Judge Schroeder could reject the deal, or still just dismiss the original felony counts based on his ruling about the minors-with-firearms law in the Rittenhouse case. Reached Saturday, Cotton said he's hopeful Schroeder will accept the negotiated agreement, noting that Black has already testified under oath as to all the factual basis.

1/9/2022,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis this week asked if people ever got tested for illness prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. His comments sparked confusion online, with many pointing out common preventative screenings for diseases like cancer. DeSantis recently faced criticism for allowing around one million COVID-19 tests to expire in a warehouse. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday raised eyebrows when at a press conference he asked whether people got screened for illness prior to the COVID-19 pandemic during a speech where he railed against testing for the coronavirus. ""Now think about it,"" DeSantis said Friday. ""Before COVID did anyone go out and seek testing to determine if they were sick? It's usually you feel like you're sick and you get tested to determine what you maybe have come down with."" A clip of DeSantis' remarks shared to Twitter elicited numerous responses that pointed out preventive screenings for numerous diseases, including sexually transmitted infections and forms of cancer, are common even in people who do not have any symptoms of the disease. Others also pointed toward a December 2021 tweet from DeSantis' wife, Casey DeSantis, where she advocated for preventative cancer testing and talked about her own breast cancer diagnosis. California Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu wrote in response to the Florida governor: ""Think about it. Before polio, did anyone go out and seek the polio vaccine? Before cancer, did anyone go out and seek mammograms, colonoscopies or pap smears? Before fire, did anyone go out and seek to boil water? New discoveries cause behavior change."" —Christina Pushaw 🐊 (@ChristinaPushaw) January 7, 2022 A representative for DeSantis told Inisder DeSantis stood by the remarks. ""He was very clear, and there is no need to clarify his remarks further,"" she said. ""Never before in history have we seen mass testing of asymptomatic people for a respiratory virus. ""The comparison of mass daily/weekly COVID testing and annual cancer screening is absurd, and it is sickening that the media and Democrats attempt to use the First Lady's cancer diagnosis to score cheap political points. Try to do better,"" she added. Public-health experts have said that regular COVID-19 testing helps stem the spread of COVID-19 by allowing individuals with asymptomatic infections to isolate to prevent spreading the disease to people who face severe complications if infected. However, rapid tests have been in short supply. Health officials have recommended people with symptoms assume they have COVID-19 and isolate for at least five days. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden's administration, which mandates businesses with more than 100 employees allows employers to do weekly testing of individuals who are not vaccinated against COVID-19, recently purchased 500 million at-home tests for Americans to order online for free. Experts have said the best time to take a rapid test is right before you see vulnerable people or a large group, but in situations where tests are very limited, some disease experts recommended people wait until they develop symptoms before getting tested for COVID-19. ""So, this is kind of a new thing where they've been saying go out and test all the time,"" Gov. DeSantis said. ""Again, you're free to do it, but what the DOH guidance from Florida is saying is that's unlikely to lead very much clinical value for you, and it also creates a lot of second-order follow up problems."" DeSantis, a Trump-aligned Republican who throughout the pandemic has been at the forefront of criticism around efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19, called widespread testing ""essentially a lockdown by stealth"" because a person would need to isolate even if they weren't showing symptoms of illness. ""What happens is blanket testing of healthy people leads to some kids not being in school, it leads to people not being able to go to work, and doing some of these isolation which may not even be justified, he said. ""To force healthy people like business to do that or whatever, we don't advise that at all. We think that's a mistake."" DeSantis' administration has also received recent criticism after it admitted it allowed between 800,000 to one million COVID-19 tests to expire in a warehouse. Kevin Guthrie, the director of Florida's Division of Emergency Management, said there hadn't been enough demand for them. Read the original article on Business Insider",Health/INSIDER,Florida Gov.

1/9/2022,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia responded angrily on Saturday to a comment by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Kazakhstan might have a hard time getting rid of Russian troops, saying he should reflect instead on U.S. military meddling around the world. Blinken on Friday challenged Russia's justification for sending forces into Kazakhstan https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/kazakhstan-detains-ex-security-chief-crisis-convulses-nation-2022-01-08 after days of violent unrest in the Central Asian country. ""One lesson of recent history is that once Russians are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave,"" Blinken said. Russia's foreign ministry called Blinken's remark ""typically offensive"" and accused him of joking about tragic events in Kazakhstan. It said Washington should analyse its own track record of interventions in countries such as Vietnam and Iraq. ""If Antony Blinken loves history lessons so much, then he should take the following into account: when Americans are in your house, it can be difficult to stay alive and not be robbed or raped,"" the ministry said on its Telegram social media channel. ""We are taught this not only by the recent past but by all 300 years of American statehood."" The ministry said the deployment in Kazakhstan was a legitimate response to Kazakhstan's request for support from the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, an alliance of ex-Soviet states that includes Russia. The Kazakh intervention comes at a time of high tension in Moscow's relations with Washington as the two countries prepare for talks on the Ukraine crisis starting on Monday.

1/9/2022,"We asked weight loss experts, and people who have lost large amounts of weight themselves, whether it’s possible to lose 90 pounds in six months simply by eating better and hitting a humble home gym for half an hour five or six times a week. Their response? Absolutely not, almost certainly not, and hahaha. That’s what Mike Pompeo, who represented Kansas in Congress before going on to become Donald Trump’s favorite cabinet member, told the New York Post that he did. “I’ve done this for 20 years,” and never seen anything like that, said Micah LaCerte, who’s considered Kansas City’s top personal trainer. “He would have to be on a massive starvation diet,” probably taking in no carbs at all. And even then, “no way with only a half-hour workout. Ninety in six is unbelievable, especially for his age, unless he’s working out for hours every day. The numbers just don’t add up. Dude, just be honest. Mike, come on, man.” While it may be theoretically possible, “it’s just not likely” without surgery, drugs or other extreme measures, says Al Rose, a longtime New York bodybuilder, trainer and coach. Even as a West Point-trained former soldier, Pompeo is “definitely being untruthful” claiming that DIY dietary changes and that amount of exercise alone could bring about such a drastic change in that length of time. And losing that much weight that quickly, he said, isn’t healthy under any circumstances. Rose, who at 65 gets up at 3:30 every morning to work out for several hours, said that during his daily workouts, he’s noticed Pompeo’s rapid weight loss during his occasional appearances on morning TV, and worried about him: “His face is sunken and his skin doesn’t look good. He’s gone from one extreme to the other. If someone sees him and is inspired” to eat healthier foods and work out more, Rose said, then of course that’s all to the good. But no one should expect or even try for such rapid results. “That message he’s spouting should not be marketed.” Pompeo, who is 58, insists that his program has nothing to do with any thought of running for president, and also that it “was nothing scientific. There was no trainer, there was no dietician. It was just me,” switching from pumpkin pancakes to egg whites and turkey bacon when his family hits the IHOP. “You can do it as well,” he says. One Kansan who lost 50 pounds over 18 months says no, you can’t. “Absolutely not. No way. And why lie about something so stupid?” On a topic that until he invited a reporter and photographer into his home gym was nobody’s business but his own. LaCerte said that we’ll know in the next six to 12 months how the former secretary of state lost the weight, because if he did it by an extreme diet that cut all carbs, it won’t be sustainable. “Eventually, you want to eat a piece of bread when you go out to dinner, or have a glass of wine.” Weight lost that way takes lean muscle with it, he said, and then “the minute carbs hit your body again, you blow up” and are worse off than when you started. Pompeo did tell the Post that “the truth is losing weight has been a lifetime struggle for me.” Telling the truth has been, too.",Health/Kansas City Star,"‘Dude, just tell the truth’: Mike Pompeo lost 90 lbs, but not the way he said he did",https://news.yahoo.com/dude-just-tell-truth-mike-213154420.html
