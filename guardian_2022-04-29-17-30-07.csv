4/29/2022,"House prices continued to climb in April but the rate of growth is slowing as soaring inflation and the cost of living crisis starts to affect the market, figures show. The average amount paid for a home in the UK climbed 0.3% to £267,620 in April, Nationwide found, the ninth consecutive month of growth. However, the rate of house price growth slowed from a 1.1% rise in March and is the smallest increase since September last year, according to the monthly property index from the building society. On an annual basis house prices are up 12.1% year on year, a modest slowdown compared with 14.3% in March. The boom has been fuelled by a shortage of housing stock and a pandemic-fuelled hunt by city dwellers for larger houses, gardens and more rural living. However, Nationwide believes the market will slow as household budgets are squeezed and mortgages become more expensive. “It is surprising that conditions have remained so buoyant, given mounting pressure on household budgets, which has severely dented consumer confidence,” said Robert Gardner, the chief economist at Nationwide. “We continue to expect the housing market to slow in the quarters ahead. The squeeze on household incomes is set to intensify, with inflation expected to rise further, perhaps reaching double digits in the quarters ahead if global energy prices remain high. “Moreover, assuming that labour market conditions remain strong, the Bank of England is likely to raise interest rates further, which will also exert a drag on the market if this feeds through to mortgage rates.” The average price of a UK home has risen by almost £50,000 since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, according to Nationwide. It said that given the shift in conditions, it was striking that a survey found 38% of respondents stated they were either in the process of moving or considering a move. The proportion was particularly high in London, where almost half said they were moving or considering a move. “The stubbornly hot housing market is showing signs of cooling,” said Myron Jobson, a senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor. “Mortgage affordability is a growing concern. The window for cheap mortgages is closing rapidly and the spectre of higher interest rates means that mortgage rates are likely to return to levels we haven’t seen in a while. The property market remains tough for homebuyers and is set to get tougher from an affordability perspective.”",News/Business,UK house price growth slows as cost of living crisis starts to hit market,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/29/uk-house-price-growth-slows-cost-of-living-crisis-starts-to-hit-market
4/29/2022,"Cassette culture may now seem like some quaint hipster affectation but, for a generation growing up in East Germany in the years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, it was the prime medium for underground music. Fans would smuggle in recordings of new music from West Germany on tape, while avant-garde musicians in the eastern bloc’s most repressive country could circumvent state controls over vinyl pressing plants – and avoid the watchful eyes of the Stasi – by copying their own music on to cassettes and distributing them (like samizdat newsletters) to likeminded freaks. One of these freaks, Jörg Thomasius, ostensibly worked in East Berlin as a boiler mechanic and art gallery technician, but his real vocation was music. He was a member of the Zappa-ish collective Das Freie Orchester, ran a home studio called Tomato and hosted a show on pirate radio, drawing inspiration from experimental krautrock bands on the other side of the iron curtain. In the 1980s, he sneaked out three albums on cassette, and Acht Gesänge der schwarzen Hunde (Eight Songs of the Black Dog) – the latest in Bureau B’s Experimenteller Elektronik-Underground DDR series – compiles 10 tracks from these DIY releases. Thomasius, born in 1955, saw himself more as a conceptual artist, playfully flinging together stray sounds, and some of these tracks sound more like installation pieces. But, using primitive tape technology and whatever keyboards he could lay his hands on, he also made some groundbreaking electronica. Okoschadel is a glistening piece of keyboard minimalism in 6/8; Küss mich mein Liebchen is a wonderfully wonky slice of drumless techno; Dritter Komparsengesang is a pulsating tribal drum groove set against disembodied voices; Meditation is a blissful 22-minute ambient rumination. Best of all is Malcolm Makes the World Go Round II, which sounds like one of Steve Reich’s sonic collages that has mutated into an alluring piece of junkyard hip-hop. Gabriel Ferrandini is a Portuguese jazz drummer, and Hair of the Dog (Canto Discos) is a wonderfully spooky album that sees him playing very texturally: tight, discordant harmonies moving into drone-based minimalism and occasional drum freakouts. Swede Linnéa Talp focuses on the physical experience of breathing and bodily movement, rendered on Arch of Motion (Thanatosis Records) in meditative church organ drones. On Reflection (Temporary Residence) is a rather lovely and blissful album made by Los Angeles/London duo William Basinski and Janek Schaefer. Dreamy, arrhythmic but harmonically constant piano solos unfold very gradually, fed through effects pedals and overlaid with astral sound effects. Pianist Vicky Chow plays new five compositions by composer Jane Antonia Cornish on Sierra (Cantaloupe Music), which lurch from jabbering, rattling minimalism to Alice Coltrane-ish cosmic marvels.",Arts/Music,Jörg Thomasius: Acht gesänge der schwarzen Hunde review | John Lewis's contemporary album of the month,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/29/jorg-thomasius-acht-gesange-der-schwarzen-hunde-review-bureau-b
4/29/2022,"Michael Bay once described his bombastic film-making style as “fucking the frame”, but if any director fornicates with the frame it must surely be Gaspar Noé, who blitzes us with flashing neon, 360-degree camera movements and intercourse closeups. So it’s a surprise when his new film, Vortex, begins with an elderly married couple (played by Françoise Lebrun and Italian horror maestro Dario Argento) sitting serenely on their Paris balcony. When the soundtrack plays a lovely Françoise Hardy song, you wonder if Noé has mellowed. But wait! If he doesn’t actually shag the frame here, he fiddles with it in two ways. First, the square-ish Academy ratio (1.37:1) of the serene prologue expands into a letterbox shape. Second, that widescreen divides into two side-by-side images, shot simultaneously with two cameras, enabling us to watch as Lebrun’s character, stricken by dementia, meanders around their cluttered flat, while Argento’s, wrestling with health issues of his own, nixes their adult son’s suggestion they move into a care home. Vortex could be Noé’s toughest watch yet – but this is due to its brutal honesty, and not because of the split-screen, which pays devastating emotional dividends. Most of today’s cutting-edge directors have at some point used split-screen sequences in their films. The effect still seems mildly adventurous, though it has been around since the birth of cinema. Lois Weber’s Suspense (1913) uses an innovative triangular split that still looks startling. In the last reel of Abel Gance’s 1927 epic Napoléon, the Academy screen opens out into three sets of film projected side by side to form a widescreen triptych. Split-screen was often used, with unobtrusive matting, to show one actor playing identical twins in the same frame, or as a witty ploy to sidestep censorship, making it look as though unmarried couples, such as Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant in Indiscreet, or Doris Day and Rock Hudson in Pillow Talk, are sharing a bed rather than just talking to each other on the phone. Split-screen is perfect for phone calls: see Mean Girls. But as Guy Ritchie’s retro-styled The Man from Uncle reminded us, it’s an aesthetic we associate with the 1960s. Genius credits designer Saul Bass used split-screen montage for the opening of Grand Prix (1966); when Film Dope asked him about the technique a few years later he said: “I think it is terrific at expressing muchness, but I suspect it’s not capable of expressing deep feeling.” Bass’s split-screen is based on multiplication of a single image, but one year after Grand Prix, Christopher Chapman demonstrated his innovative “multidynamic image technique” in A Place to Stand, a landmark short made for the Ontario pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal. (Earworm warning: I saw this film 50 years ago, and the maddening theme song has been lodged in my head ever since.) Chapman presents multiple panes in various sizes and shapes on a single screen; sometimes the images in the panes move independently, sometimes as components of one big picture. Steve McQueen saw A Place to Stand at an advance screening in Hollywood and was impressed. One year later, Norman Jewison inserted split-screen sequences into The Thomas Crown Affair, including the opening credits, and McQueen playing polo. That same year, in The Boston Strangler, Richard Fleischer divided his screen to show a creepy phone caller, the recipient of the call, and the call being traced, all at once. Spilt-screen enabled Michael Wadleigh, director-cinematographer of Woodstock, to show crowd reactions in the same frame as the performers, while in 1973, Soylent Green employed it in the opening credits to encapsulate the “muchness” of proliferating industrialism and pollution. The director most associated with split-screen is Brian De Palma, who turned it into an operatic art form. In Sisters, he shows the point of view of a dying murder victim at the same time as a witness looking back at him, and in Phantom of the Paradise he ramps up tension between the planting of a bomb and its explosion. Many mainstream audiences encountered split-screen for the first time in Carrie, when the traumatised antihero wreaks telekinetic carnage at her prom. De Palma told Cinefantastique magazine: “I felt the destruction had to be shown in split-screen, because how many times could you cut from Carrie to things moving around? You can overdo that.” But split-screen all the way through a film? In 1966, Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey conceived Chelsea Girls as a six-and-a-half hour experimental film, before dividing the footage and projecting two contrasting images side by side in a three-and-a-quarter hour film. The 1973 psycho-thriller Wicked, Wicked, directed by Richard L Bare, was filmed almost entirely in “Duo-vision”: the widescreen divided into two and showing not just murders from the point of view of both killer and victim, but also flashbacks to the psychopath’s childhood, creepy Bava-esque corpses, and a random organist playing music from The Phantom of the Opera. Results range from lame to preposterous, so clearly this is a cult film waiting to happen. The most ambitious split-screen project to get a more-or-less mainstream release, and certainly one of cinema’s more enjoyable avant garde experiments, is 2000’s Timecode. Writer-director-editor Mike Figgis satirises his own experiences in Hollywood with four sets of footage, shot simultaneously by four cameras and displayed on a screen divided into quadrants showing two dozen actors improvising around a predetermined story about a film company casting its new production, The Bitch from Louisiana. Noé’s other format-related gambit in Vortex – opening out from a square screen into a wide one – is already something of a cliche. Most filmgoers of my generation first became aware of aspect ratio thanks to the abomination of pan-and-scan, in which TV companies in the 1970s and 1980s routinely cropped films to fit 4:3 TV sets, thus reducing the climactic shootout in the widescreen Once Upon a Time in the West to an expanse of blue sky and the edge of someone’s hat brim. That was before the advent of DVD and widescreen televisions. Nowadays TV networks tend to err in the opposite direction, reformatting 4:3 shows such as Friends or The Wire to fit widescreen sets. But aspect ratios can and do coexist in harmony. Back in 1956, Tom Ewell commanded the edges of the frame to slide further apart at the start of The Girl Can’t Help It, easing his 1950s audience into what was then a relatively unfamiliar widescreen format. Since then, the expanding screen has been used many times to signify the passing of time or a shift in location, from Mad Max 2 and Galaxy Quest to Oz the Great and Powerful and Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. And digital technology has made format-switching easier than ever. Wes Anderson uses different screen ratios to signal three different eras in The Grand Budapest Hotel. In the intimate sci-fi drama After Yang, writer-director Kogonada switches between three different aspect ratios (two of them can be seen in the trailer) in a more subliminal way to differentiate between everyday life, video calls and memories as a family struggles with feelings of bereavement after their “technosapiens” (androids) breaks down. Attempts to woo audiences back into cinemas with 3D or Imax (itself a square-ish format, albeit a gigantic one) have overshadowed a quiet sea change further down the budgetary scale. After decades of widescreen (1.85:1 or 2.35:1, for example) as the norm, the squarer Academy ratio has been making a comeback, with film-makers such as Kelly Reichardt (First Cow), Paul Schrader (First Reformed), Joel Coen (The Tragedy of Macbeth) and Paweł Pawlikowski (Cold War) making it the arthouse director’s format of choice. Some have gone even further: Robert Eggers’ The Lighthouse is in 1.19:1, while Xavier Dolan’s Mommy (2014) was filmed in a perfect square. “The character is our main subject, inescapably at the centre of our attention,” said Dolan, and it does indeed appear to signal an intent by film-makers to distance their work from an increasingly homogenised cinema of widescreen spectacle. Can the frame be squeezed even further, perhaps reflecting the way most people film with their smartphones? I’ve yet to hear about an entire non-experimental feature in a vertical format, though, in his short The Stunt Double, made for iPhone, Damien Chazelle presents an amusing alternative history of cinema genres filmed that way. Just as sex never falls out of fashion, so film-makers’ appetite for frame-fucking seems impossible to quench.",Arts/Film,You’ve been reframed: how playing with split-screen and aspect ratio went mainstream,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/29/youve-been-reframed-how-playing-with-split-screen-and-aspect-ratio-went-mainstream
4/29/2022,"In a departure from his usual playful psychological dramas, François Ozon’s 2018 film is a fact-based tale about child abuse in the French Catholic church. When devout parent Alexandre (Melvil Poupaud) discovers his attacker, Father Bernard Preynat, is still working with kids and complains to his Lyon diocese, he receives sympathy but little action. Reporting it to the police, Alexandre inspires fellow victims François (Denis Ménochet) and Emmanuel (Swann Arlaud) to expand the campaign as more crimes – and the church’s cover-ups – come to light. Shot dispassionately, this story’s emotional impact comes from the devastating testimonies of the men whose lives were affected.Saturday 30 April, 9pm, BBC Four Rural Iceland police officer Ingimundur (Ingvar Sigurdsson) is on compassionate leave after his wife’s death in a car accident. He’s getting by – grumpily attending counselling, renovating a house and looking after his granddaughter Salka (a wonderfully natural Ida Mekkín Hlynsdóttir). But when he discovers his spouse was having an affair his stability starts to crumble. Hlynur Pálmason’s dark drama uses the country’s landscapes and changeable weather as reflections of Ingimundur’s mental state, his unresolved grief submerged under rain, snow and wind.Saturday 30 April, 12.55am, BBC Two A rare screening of a black comedy by that most relentlessly inventive of film-makers, Peter Greenaway. This 1988 work is structured around game-playing: the numbers one to 100 appear sequentially on screen or on the soundtrack for you to spot. Meanwhile, three women (Joan Plowright, Juliet Stevenson and Joely Richardson), all called Cissie, plot their husbands’ watery deaths and get coroner Madgett (Bernard Hill) to cover up the crimes. Steeped in imagery from art history, it’s a fleshy, Brechtian morality play, set to Michael Nyman’s great funereal score.Sunday 1 May, 1.30am, Film4 In Andrew Haigh’s deft drama, a Norfolk couple’s belated 40th wedding anniversary brings not fond reminiscences but memories and revelations that threaten to shatter their relationship. Charlotte Rampling plays Kate, who discovers something about a former lover of her husband Geoff (Tom Courtenay) that calls into question the entire basis of their hitherto content marriage. It’s another fantastic work from British director Haigh, subtle but devastating, and he elicits great performances from both his venerable leads.Monday 2 May, 1.25am, Film4 Toronto metal band Anvil were briefly a thing in the 80s.

The insouciant Frank isn’t really taken in by Diane’s complaints about her supposedly vicious stepmother or professions of love, but is tempted by the prospect of funding his dreams.

The plot is typical F&G romantic fluff, a wafer-thin farce of mistaken identity featuring a near-identical cast to The Gay Divorcee (which follows at 10.40pm) in a Venice seemingly created from royal icing, but with vast sets ripe for dancing in.Thursday 5 May, 9pm, BBC Four",Arts/Television & radio,By the Grace of God to 45 Years: the seven best films to watch on TV this week,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/29/by-the-grace-of-god-to-45-years-the-seven-best-films-to-watch-on-tv-this-week
4/29/2022,"The UK international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, has urged male colleagues to “keep your hands in your pockets” as she said all women in parliament have been subjected to “wandering hands”. Speaking on Sky News on Friday, Trevelyan, the MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed, said allegations that a Conservative MP watched pornography in the Commons chamber were “completely unacceptable” but declined to say whether they should be sacked. She said some men in Westminster thought being elected made them “God’s gift to women”, although the vast majority were “delightful, committed parliamentarians”. The Tory chief whip issued a statement on Wednesday suggesting the allegation that a Conservative MP watched pornography in parliament should be referred to the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), which deals with sexual harassment and other disciplinary matters. Senior Tories questioned why he had not taken action directly against the MP, whose alleged behaviour was witnessed by two female colleagues in recent months. Asked about the broader culture in Westminster, Trevelyan said: “All of us as women in parliament have been subjected to inappropriate language, to wandering hands, as my granny used to call it, it doesn’t change. The vast majority of the men I work with are delightful. They’re committed parliamentarians, they’re passionate about the causes they fight. “But there are a few for whom too much drink, or indeed a sort of view that somehow being elected makes them God’s gift to women, that they can suddenly please themselves, that is never OK.” She said there were a number of ways to help women report their experiences, which had been set up in the wake of the MeToo movement. “Fundamentally, if you’re a bloke, keep your hands in your pockets and behave as you would if you had your daughter in the room,” she said. Trevelyan said she was comfortable “calling out anybody who thinks their wandering hands are OK” and that she had done a number of times. She questioned why the Tory MP accused of watching porn in the Commons had the time to do it, as well as why he thought it was acceptable. “I haven’t had the chance to talk to the chief whip, and I know the ladies in question who apparently saw this completely, completely inappropriate activity have been encouraged to use the formal system in the House of Commons to be able to report it and I hope very much that they will or indeed have, I don’t know, and that the system will demonstrate if that was the case, exactly what the punishment should be for that sort of inappropriate behaviour,” she said. Questioned about the drinking culture in the House of Commons, Trevelyan said: “Responsible drinking has to be the way forwards.” The identity of the MP is known to party whips, it is understood. Misogyny and sexism in parliament have come under close scrutiny in recent days, after a widely criticised Mail on Sunday story claimed Tory MPs believed Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, crossed and uncrossed her legs to distract Boris Johnson at prime minister’s questions.",News/Politics,"Keep your hands in your pockets, minister tells male MPs amid sexism row",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/29/anne-marie-trevelyan-male-mps-sexism
4/29/2022,"The man accused of raping Brittany Higgins has lost his bid to delay the ACT supreme court trial. On Friday, chief justice Lucy McCallum rejected an application by Bruce Lehrmann for a temporary or permanent stay, along with his bid to have media articles about the alleged sexual assault taken down. Lehrmann denies any form of sexual activity took place in early 2019 and is pleading not guilty. The trial has been set down for a six-week hearing starting on 6 June. Lehrmann’s lawyers had argued a fair trial was impossible because of the publicity surrounding the case and the requirement for a jury trial. In a redacted judgment, McCallum explained her reasons for refusing the application to have the media articles taken down. She said it was a “pious hope” to attempt to regulate the press by the “inexact tool of suppression” given the advent of social media and the internet. “For the reasons already stated, I am not persuaded that the material which the evidence establishes remains on the internet is of a kind that cannot be addressed by appropriate direction to the jury,” the judge said. McCallum also rejected a request for a broader injunction suppressing “publications” about the case, stating it would be “impossible to enforce” and “it is not clear even to me to whom it is directed”.",News/Australia news,Man accused of raping Brittany Higgins loses bid to delay Canberra trial,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/29/man-accused-of-raping-brittany-higgins-loses-bid-to-delay-canberra-trial
4/29/2022,"Rammstein fill stadiums around the world, despite the fact that, as they admit, 99% of their fans have no idea what they’re singing about. They’ve managed that by having a jawdropping live show, cultivating a strong air of unwholesomeness and making their music as streamlined and efficient as possible: everything is honed into such a brutal, mechanical pulse that you can almost hear the pyro cues in their songs. On their eighth album, the lyrics are again in German, the riffs again pound and all you might expect is present and correct. At times it’s so on the nose you all but roll your eyes – the oompah band that introduces a song about wanting to meet a woman with large breasts, called Dicke Titten (Big Tits), for example. Zick Zack, a graphic description of plastic surgery, is almost certainly the only rock song to comment on the re-found visibility of a man’s penis after the removal of seven kilos of belly fat. Till Lindemann, as ever, intones as if he is announcing desperate news over the radio, which adds the required oddness to Meine Tränen (My Tears), about an oppressive mother-son relationship. But it’s hard not to get swept along: Rammstein’s world is so perfectly formed – the gothic, operatic sweep of their metal delivers hook after hook, endorphin hit after endorphin hit; the grooves are as deep as canyons – that ridiculous or not, there’s no risk of boredom, even as you know the whole thing is really just an excuse to get all the flames and explosions back on the road.",Arts/Music,"Rammstein: Zeit review – ridiculous, but no risk of boredom",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/29/rammstein-zeit-review-spinefarm-metal
4/29/2022,"The Queensland Liberal National party’s decision to direct Senate preferences to Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party has raised surprisingly few objections. In the past, such a move has proved political poison. Just ask the former state opposition leader, Tim Nicholls. At the 2017 state election, the LNP sent preferences to One Nation in 50 seats. Nicholls said he would consider forming government with the rightwing party and, on the eve of the election, his tongue slipped just enough to imply the parties were in cahoots. Hanson and her political vehicle retain some hardcore support in Queensland – enough to mean that One Nation voters’ preferences can be strategically important in certain seats. A deal can have political benefits; but it can also have some broader problems. Hanson has proved adept at corralling her pockets of support to cobble together enough votes to win a Senate quota. But at the same time, pollsters say that her “unfavourables” – the percentage of voters who disapprove of her – are extremely high. There’s a toxic byproduct to any political payoff that an alliance with Hanson might deliver. Nicholls can attest. The LNP lost seven seats in south-east Queensland at the 2017 state election, with the party almost wiped-out in greater Brisbane, where it was left with just four MPs. There’s little doubt that Nicholls (a lawyer from the well-to-do inner-Brisbane suburb of Clayfield) was damaged in the city by the perception of an association with Hanson. At most federal polls since Hanson’s political emergence in 1996, major parties have been urged to put her party last. Even as recently as 2019 (after Hanson’s key adviser James Ashby and Senate candidate Steven Dickson were filmed “on the sauce” discussing seeking donations from the US gun lobby) the Liberal party succumbed to pressure to put One Nation below Labor on its how-to-vote cards. The LNP’s decision to direct Senate preferences to Hanson in 2022 seems a risk, but probably an educated one based on a few new variables. First is the fracturing of the rightwing fringe (who include former LNP folks) in a way that means Hanson has serious competition for the election’s biggest pantomime villain. The second is that Labor’s own north Queensland how-to-vote cards have complicated their ability to tell city voters that the LNP is courting the fringe right. Compare the pair: Labor’s how to vote cards in Brisbane vs DawsonPretty insulting that they’ll seek to align themselves with Palmer & Katter in regional Qld where they think progressive voters won’t see it. Talk about not learning lessons from 2019 lol pic.twitter.com/DWvcfhtcQw In inner Brisbane, Labor is directing preferences to the Greens. But in the seat of Dawson, which is based around Mackay, Labor how-to-vote cards suggest voters first go to minor parties led by Bob Katter and Clive Palmer. Finally, Hanson’s own claims she is targeting moderate Liberals could help, rather than hinder, city-based MPs like Trevor Evans in Brisbane and Julian Simmonds in Ryan avoid to any backlash. The One Nation vote in these places is tiny, bordering on inconsequential. A sceptical person may wonder why Hanson’s anti-moderate stance doesn’t also extend to long-serving MP Warren Entsch in the far north seat of Leichhardt, where the One Nation vote is three times higher than in the city. The election conversation in regional Queensland has been, so far at least, noticeably different from 2019. Especially around the topics of coal, climate and energy transition. On the eve of the election campaign, the Queensland government made a series of announcements in Gladstone, talking the region up as a “renewable energy superpower” and foreshadowing new economy jobs around hydrogen. Two things have changed, say people in the know. The first is that significant work has been done on the ground in places like Gladstone, where grassroots campaigns have been running (under the national radar) to have more positive conversations about the opportunities that can flow from investments in new economies. The second is that these sorts of projects are now starting to feel real. Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest lent some mining credibility to those efforts this year, when he turned up in Gladstone to turn the first sod on a renewable hydrogen hub. If the real conversation in these places has moved on from 2019, this week Scott Morrison sought to wind the election debate back three years, hitting on all of the same “us and them” rhetoric touchstones that reduce Queensland’s complex political landscape to a city v regions binary. “We don’t want two Australias,” Morrison said in Rockhampton, with no attempt at irony, before saying regional Queenslanders felt “looked down on”. “Their jobs and lifestyles derided or seen as somehow unworthy, in a world where the big talkers all seem to work in government, or finance, or the tech industry or the media. “You witnessed this sort of thing first-hand at the last election – courtesy of Bob Brown and the Greens and their convoy to central Queensland. A convoy against coal jobs.” Labor’s 2019 election review found that Coalition campaigning “associating Labor with the Greens in voters’ minds” contributed to the party’s loss of support in regional Queensland. Morrison is back there again, evoking the anti-Adani convoy. Labor seems to be going out of its way not to direct preferences to the Greens in Dawson. It seems both major parties have found a new political villain; while the old one, Hanson, looks set to ride under the radar, via LNP preferences, to another six-year Senate term.",News/Australia news,Election preference deals and strategies that could benefit Pauline Hanson and One Nation,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/29/election-preference-deals-and-strategies-that-could-benefit-pauline-hanson-and-one-nation
