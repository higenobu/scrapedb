4/6/2022,"Ministers have been accused of waging a “woke war” after a key LGBT+ government adviser quit over plans to exclude transgender people from a long-awaited ban on conversion practices. Iain Anderson said he was “completely shocked” by the decision and suggested Downing Street appeared to be “trying to drive a wedge” between those who are gay, bisexual, lesbian and transgender. After more than 100 organisations pulled out of the government’s international conference on LGBT+ rights, Anderson said the event should not take place, admitting: “Trust has been eroded.” Anderson added that he “took this job on the basis there’d be a policy for everyone in the LGBT community, but apparently that’s not going to happen”. The move will come as a further blow to Boris Johnson, who suffered a backlash from Tory MPs after last week’s decision not to pursue the ban on conversion “therapy”. A partial U-turn came hours later, but Downing Street only committed to cracking down on conversion practices for those questioning their sexuality – not their gender. Anderson told ITV News “Britain needs a strategy for trans people and I can’t see one at the moment”. He said: “We have a tabloid debate going on about people’s lives. It’s not a respectful debate; it’s turned into a woke war. It’s turned into a wedge issue … I was LGBT business champion not LGB or T, and that’s why I’m walking away. “I feel what the government is doing is trying to create a wedge between LGB people and trans people. I think it’s the wrong approach and I disagree with the policy.” It comes as members of the trans community are left reeling from the decision, with many actively considering leaving the UK. “Every single trans person I speak to, without exception, is incredibly demoralised,” said Katy Montgomerie, activist and YouTuber, who adds that she recently applied for a gender recognition certificate “just in case I have to leave the country”. “People message me every day saying, ‘I can’t stop crying, can you give me some hope?’ “Do I have to call ahead to pubs now to see if I can use the toilet? It’s disgusting and there doesn’t seem to be an end in sight. It’s horrific to be told you are a second class citizen.” In his resignation letter, Anderson told Johnson that conversion practices were abhorrent and said it was “deeply damaging” the government had briefed that trans people would be excluded from future legislation. The timing of the news also came only a day after the Conservative backbencher Jamie Wallis became the UK’s first openly trans MP. Wallis said he was “bitterly disappointed” at the government’s backtracking, saying that it “cannot be described as anything other than a broken promise”. Jennie Kermode, film-maker and secretary of Trans Media Watch, said: “There had been some hope around Jamie Wallis coming out last week, and the possibility of more trans people in parliament but the past few days have been extreme. “Trans people are feeling hurt, scared and threatened and some are talking about leaving the UK. But we are also feeling buoyed up by the support we’ve received from the wider LGBT community and allies.” A senior government source said the issue had now turned into a “complete mess”. The source added there would probably be “a fight in the Commons” from those Tory MPs who may propose amendments to widen the ban. More organisations on Tuesday also announced they were pulling out of the government’s LGBT+ conference, Safe To Be Me, which was scheduled to take place in a matter of months. The Trades Union Congress said it was “deeply concerned” at the decision, adding it “shows that the government does not prioritise inclusion and safety for all LGBT+ people”. The Unison union said the government had made a despicable U-turn and it constituted “another attack on trans right by the Conservatives”.",News/Society,LGBT government adviser quits over conversion practices U‑turn,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/05/lgbt-government-adviser-quits-over-conversion-practices-uturn
4/6/2022,"Satellite images showing bodies strewn across the streets of Bucha have provided a rebuttal to claims by the Russian state that Ukrainian forces placed dead people in the town in “staged provocation” after Russian forces had already withdrawn. The corpses’ positions on the photos, taken in mid-March, match those from smartphone pictures published in early April, allowing the massacre to be precisely dated to before Russian forces evacuated the town. The analysis of the images, published by the New York Times, is the latest example of the growing importance of satellite imagery to reporters, researchers and activists seeking to document the progression of the war in Ukraine and gather evidence of war crimes in the region. Along with cheap and accessible drone footage, the technology has revolutionised the practice of “open-source intelligence”, or OSINT, says Eliot Higgins, founder of OSINT journalism group Bellingcat. “Syria was where everyone learned the value of satellite imagery when it came to this kind of stuff,” Higgins says. “But now, thanks to the work of companies like Planet Labs, we’re in a position where we can even task satellites a few times a month to certain locations. Lots of people are doing that at the moment, and they’re all focused on Ukraine, so what we’re getting is lots and lots of good resolution satellite imagery from all over the country. “Often that’s accessible to people within hours. So you hear a report and, within a few hours, if you’re lucky and the clouds are good enough, you can get a nice high-resolution image of what you’re looking at.” Many of the skills applied in documenting the Ukrainian battlefield were honed in investigations like Bellingcat’s examination of the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 by Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014, and similar efforts documenting war crimes in the Syrian Civil War. Matching an area of satellite footage with a single picture posted on social media is no mean feat, but the best OSINT investigators have developed an almost uncanny ability to find locations. In the early days, though, researchers were limited by the satellite footage posted to Google Earth, which was often years out of date. Now, as imagery providers have got more used to custom from media and activists, they are eager to provide useful pictures. But while satellite imagery is more widely available, and more responsive, the actual pictures have not changed. Consumer use of satellite imagery is legally capped at a resolution of 0.25 square meters a pixel, regardless of the capability of the cameras in space, and has been since 2014. “There’s better resolution imagery,we’re just not allowed to use it,” Higgins says. The world’s militaries, of course, have no such limits – as was conclusively proved in 2019 when Donald Trump tweeted out a classified image of an Iranian missile launchpad in ultra-high-res.",News/World news,Satellite images of corpses in Bucha prove Russian claims wrong,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/satellite-images-of-corpses-in-bucha-prove-russian-claims-wrong
4/6/2022,"Asghar Farhadi, the Oscar winning director of A Separation and The Salesman, has lost a plagiarism case brought by one of his former students, who had claimed he took the idea for his 2021 film A Hero from a documentary she had made for a film class. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Azadeh Masihzadeh brought the case after Farhadi had earlier sued her for defamation; in both cases the courts ruled in Masihzadeh’s favour. In 2014, Masihzadeh made a short documentary for a workshop led by Farhadi, about a real-life inmate of a debtors’ prison, who found and returned a bag of gold while on leave at the prison. Masihzadeh’s film was called All Winners, All Losers, and showed at a film festival in the Iranian city of Shiraz in 2018. Farhadi’s film A Hero, which stars Amir Jadidi as a debtors’ prison inmate who finds and returns a bag of gold, screened at the Cannes film festival in 2021 and won the second place grand prix; its script is credited to Farhadi alone. Masihzadeh told the Hollywood Reporter that Farhadi had pressured her into signing a document handing rights to the story over to him without payment. Farhadi claimed through his lawyer that the main idea for his film came much earlier, and he was inspired by the Bertolt Brecht play Life of Galileo. Farhadi’s claim for defamation against Masihzadeh was dismissed after the court found there was insufficient evidence to suggest Masihzadeh was deliberately trying to damage the director’s reputation. The subsequent plagiarism suit also went Masihzadeh’s way, after Farhadi claimed he had independently researched the story and did not credit her on A Hero. His sentence is yet to be determined.",Arts/Film,Oscar-winning director Asghar Farhadi loses plagiarism case in Iranian court,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/05/asghar-farhadi-loses-a-hero-plagiarism-case-in-iranian-court
4/6/2022,"The European Commission has launched the bloc’s new rule-of-law disciplinary procedure for the first time against Hungary, two days after nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, won a fourth landslide victory in parliamentary elections. Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president, told the European parliament on Tuesday that Budapest had been informed of the decision and “we will now send the letter of formal notification to start the conditionality mechanism”. The untested mechanism, designed to prevent EU funds from being misused by countries backsliding on the rule of law, was agreed by all 27 EU leaders in late 2020 and could ultimately deprive Budapest of more than €40bn of EU payments. “It’s happening. Finally!” tweeted the German Green MEP Daniel Freund, a vocal critic of Orbán and of the commission’s reluctance to act on his democratic backsliding. Von de Leyen in particular had been accused of dragging her feet on the issue. The move followed shock in Brussels after Orbán hit out at “opponents” – including “Brussels bureaucrats” but also Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy – in his victory speech, hours after horrific images emerged of atrocities in Bucha, near Kyiv. Few in the EU offered their congratulations after the Hungarian prime minister’s win, which followed years of criticism he was undercutting liberal democratic rights and values, and accusations that he was using funds from the bloc to enrich his associates. The Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, however, offered his congratulations to Orbán, a long-term Kremlin ally, on Monday, saying the “further development of a bilateral partnership fully accords to the interests of the peoples of Russia and Hungary”. Prominent anti-EU politicians including Britain’s Nigel Farage, France’s Marine Le Pen and Italy’s Matteo Salvini were also quick to congratulate Orbán. “When the people vote, the people win,” tweeted Le Pen. Even if it takes time to finalise internal work on the sanction, critics of the Orbán regime have said the commission’s decision alone could have a rapid impact, making it harder for Budapest to borrow money, for example. Orbán, in power since 2010, has tightened the noose around academics, NGOs and the media, as well as restricting the freedoms of migrants and gay people. There have also been multiple allegations of EU funds being diverted to Orbán’s friends and family. The European court of justice last month dismissed complaints about the mechanism from Hungary and Poland, whose ruling Law and Justice party is in a long-running battle with Brussels over judicial independence, increasing pressure on the commission to act. In a milestone in the battle for the rule of law in the EU, the bloc’s highest court rejected the countries’ cases “in their entirety”, confirming that EU member states can be deprived of EU funds when they fail to meet democratic standards. The EU’s values, such as the rule of law, “define the very identity of the European Union as a legal order”, the court said. “Compliance with those values cannot be reduced to an obligation which a candidate state must meet in order to accede to the European Union and which it may disregard after accession.” The law is intended to protect from fraud against the EU budget, rather than all rule-of-law violations. It won strong backing from governments in western Europe that are net payers into the EU budget. But it was criticised by Hungary and Poland, both net recipients of EU funds, who have received billions of euros since joining the bloc in 2004 to improve public infrastructure, fund universities and support farmers.",News/World news,European Commission launches rule-of-law disciplinary procedure against Hungary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/european-commission-launches-rule-of-law-disciplinary-procedure-against-hungary
4/6/2022,"Apolicy of indifference to the plight of Ukrainian refugees would be morally repugnant, but honest. Millions fleeing the criminal butchery of Vladimir Putin’s army would be told that they were not welcome in Britain and should seek sanctuary elsewhere. That is not the UK government line. Instead, something more insidious has taken shape – a device for mixing the desperation of displaced people with hospitality offered by the British public, and feeding both into a bureaucratic mangle so every drop of uncertainty and dread can be wrung out. That is the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Making pain from generosity is an innovation in nastiness that no single Whitehall department could achieve. It takes a special failure of collaboration involving Michael Gove’s Levelling Up department, Priti Patel’s Home Office and the special ingredient – Boris Johnson’s delinquent inattention to detail. The scheme was launched on 14 March after Downing Street realised that public opinion was appalled by the absence of a fast track for Ukrainian refugees. Gove told MPs that British people, having “opened their hearts”, would also “open their homes”. But Patel held the keys. By the end of the month, 32,200 applications had been made, and only 4,700 visas issued. Those numbers describe the contours of a bottleneck. They cannot convey what happens inside the bottle, the desperate lives pressed against its glass edges, the slow suffocation of promises, the frightened look back at scenes of cold-blooded massacre and other atrocities in a homeland under threat of genocide. About 4.2 million refugees have fled Ukraine, with a further 6.5 million internally displaced. One is supposed to be staying with my family in Brighton. We made contact via friends of friends. As sponsors, we helped apply for a visa. The case is now suspended in an administrative void with thousands of others. Just to reach that stage requires navigating an online system that could be the hardest level in a Kafka-themed video game. And you need a computer and a stable internet connection, which are not always available to refugees. We send what reassurance we can into the blackout, to faces made pale by the light of a phone screen and by fear of Russian missiles. What to say? There is a good news story about the system as it is meant to work. Then there is reality, gleaned from conversations with MPs, charities, local government and Whitehall officials. There are delays at every junction. Documents uploaded online seem not to be appearing in the UK visa service database. Those applications aren’t even in limbo. They are in the antechamber before limbo. Once across the threshold they enter the “hostile environment” – the notorious Home Office apparatus for limiting numbers of people entering Britain. I am assured that this machine is being repurposed to maximise permissions for Ukrainians, but the infrastructure of rejection is not easily reassembled. The department’s watchword is security, which means presuming that anyone crossing the border without a British passport is up to no good – fraud, espionage, terrorism. Visas can only be issued once the relevant checks are carried out using a limited number of specialised computers. It all takes time. Desperate mothers and traumatised children are not above suspicion. The default to mistrust is hardly new. Fear of admitting jihadist interlopers stalks the processing of Syrian and Afghan asylum claims. Even in the second world war, some Jewish refugees from the Third Reich were interned in British prisons because they were citizens of Germany or Austria. The extreme unlikelihood of Jews harbouring secret allegiance to Hitler was not taken into account. Meanwhile, the rest of Whitehall is grappling with the fierce complexity of an open-ended refugee settlement programme that was just a website when Gove declared it open. British sponsors finding their own matches with Ukrainian refugees is just phase one. The scheme will then be expanded “rapidly” to include charities, churches and community groups. That upscaling process is happening mostly in circumvention of the Home Office, deemed more an obstacle than a partner. Mobilising the goodwill and spare rooms of the British public was a neat idea in theory that gets untidy on inspection of practicalities. The task falls mostly to local councils, which have to worry about host suitability, standards of accommodation, school places for children who might also need support for trauma. There will be pressure on services that are already rationed by budget cuts. Refugee charities worry about what happens to new arrivals whose sponsors are disqualified or pull out. What happens when support payments for hosts expire after six months? Already there is a problem of bogus sponsorship by human traffickers and other predators using the government’s vague promise of welcome as cover to harvest victims for exploitation. Such are the gaps in ministerial thinking that civil servants, councillors and voluntary groups are frantically trying to plug. Privately, they say the scheme is more gap than substance – a Potemkin policy launched to dispel bad headlines, with nothing behind it. “Not thought-through” is the phrase I keep hearing. In other words, the policy for Ukrainian refugees is exactly like every other policy of Johnson’s government. There was a moment of political urgency, a humanitarian crisis that stirred the nation’s conscience. Alarm bells rang in Downing Street, where public opinion must serve as proxy for conscience. The prime minister wanted the ringing to stop. A plan was hatched; not so much a plan as an idea. Barely an idea; a slogan: “Homes for Ukraine”. Then someone has to deliver the plan. The rhetoric must somehow be lifted off the page, propped up in three dimensions, spread across departments, filled with resources. By then the news caravan has moved on and Downing Street’s focus is elsewhere. Johnson is clearly enjoying his status as a friend of Ukraine. The emergency has lifted his spirits by relegating domestic scandal down the news running order. But the prime minister’s friendships are always lopsided. He is interested in the rugged soldierly face of war and the new-edition “Boris” action figure in khaki. The complex long-term needs of refugees are less his thing. They can be someone else’s problem, which he sees as a problem solved. Except these are people’s lives, their hopes. The pledges that have been made to them come not from ministers but from ordinary citizens who are trying to do a decent thing and thought, naively, that the government could help. Now they feel like accomplices in a grotesque hoax of unfathomable cruelty. It is not news that Johnson lets people down. It is one of the constants of his career. Everyone is betrayed in the end. But, with help from an incompetent cabinet, he has outdone himself with the offer to make Britain a place of sanctuary to Ukrainian refugees. Having run out of his own pledges to break, he has stooped to purloining promises from the public and breaking those too.

4/6/2022,"Archival footage has been found of the singer Prince at a teachers’ strike in 1970 when he was just 11. The video was first discovered by WCCO, a CBS News affiliate in Minnesota, and shows film of an April 1970 teachers’ strike. WCCO restored the 1970 strike footage to give more context for a strike that took place last month in Minneapolis. When the affiliate’s production manager, Matt Liddy, a Minneapolis native, heard about it, he was curious to see it for himself. “I grew up in Minneapolis, so all I cared about was looking at cool old buildings from the place I grew up. Did I recognize my old school? Did I recognize any landmarks?” said Liddy in an interview with WCCO. While watching the footage, Liddy noticed a reporter interviewing children, and was particularly struck by one child. “I immediately just went out to the newsroom and started showing people, and saying, ‘I’m not gonna tell you who I think this is, but who do you think this is?’ And every single person [said]: Prince,” said Liddy. Although WCCO did not have the appropriate technology to hear the sound on the video, a specialist was able to extract audio, revealing what the younger Prince said. “I think they should get a better education too, because, um … I think they should get some more money ’cause they work, they be working extra hours for us and all that stuff,” said Prince, who at the time would have been known by his full birth name, Prince Rogers Nelson. Prince was not asked for his name in the footage, so WCCO had to find other sources who could verify his identity. Accompanying Prince was a boy who introduced himself as Ronnie Kitchen, but WCCO could not track him down. Prince’s fifth-grade yearbook photos, which WCCO unearthed, did not help either. So WCCO asked historian Kristen Zschomler, who specializes in Twin Cities property and landmarks and happens to be an avid Prince fan. Zschomler confirmed the identification, based on a picture she had of him in sixth grade. She also noted that the school in the background of the restored video was Lincoln junior high school, which Prince attended at the time. Zschomler also found friends of Prince who knew him as a child, including Terrance Jackson, who was in Prince’s first band, Grand Central, when the two were teenagers. “That is Prince! Standing right there with the hat on, right? That’s Skipper! Oh my God,” said Jackson on viewing the footage. “It’s just amazing to see him, that small, that young, and hear his voice,” said Jackson’s wife, Rhoda, who grew up alongside Prince and Terrance. “That’s Prince, AKA Skipper to the Northside.” Prince was one of the most successful pop musicians of all time. He died in 2016, having sold more than 150m albums, written at least 500 published songs and won most major international music awards.",News/US news,"Rare footage discovered of Prince, 11, at 1970 Minneapolis teachers’ strike",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/05/prince-1970-footage-minnesota-teachers-strike
4/6/2022,"The death of a young Jewish man in Bobigny, north of Paris, has shocked France and sparked outrage among French presidential candidates, who seized on it to denounce criminality and a possible antisemitic attack. Jérémy Cohen, 31, was killed when he was hit by a tram in Bobigny in February, which was initially reported in local media as a traffic iaccident. But when his family leafleted the area to see if local people had more information on what had happened, a witness came forward with video footage, which circulated online this week. Cohen, who had a disability, was surrounded by a group of men and attacked. As he escaped, he was hit by the tram and died shortly afterwards in hospital. After Cohen’s family spoke to Radio Shalom about the case, presidential candidates used the death to suggest the French authorities were not doing enough on the case or on crime in general, days before the first round of the presidential election. The former TV pundit and far-right, anti-immigration candidate, Éric Zemmour, was the first politician to raise the case on social media, asking if Cohen had died because of the violence of a group of thugs. “Did he die because he is Jewish?” Zemmour asked. “Why has this affair been covered up?” Zemmour wrote a magazine article arguing that the case showed the “poisoned cocktail of contemporary France”, from what he called a lax justice system and young thugs with no care for human life. He said French authorities permanently lied to cover up crime by immigrants. Zemmour said in a TV interview that he was shocked by the crime and wanted to restore “peace” to France. On a visit to Brittany on Tuesday as part of his re-election campaign, the president, Emmanuel Macron, said: “I want to express my solidarity with Jérémy Cohen’s family”. He said the video had “shaken” everyone, and the justice system must bring “complete clarity on the situation” and must find answers “as swiftly as possible”. Macron’s office had contacted the Cohen family to express “compassion” and concern. The far-right’s Marine Le Pen – who polls show is likely to go through to a second-round runoff against Macron on 10 April – told French radio there must be a parliamentary inquiry over whether authorities deliberately covered up the case. Cohen’s brother told Radio Shalom, that his kippah, or traditional Jewish cap, had been found on the ground at the scene, emphasising that he did not know if he was wearing it at the time of the attack. The family’s lawyer, Franck Serfati, told RMC radio on Tuesday that at this stage there was no “tangible proof” of an antisemitic attack and the investigation was continuing. Serfati said: “The question to be answered is: was Jérémy wearing the kippah? Was it hidden? Did his attackers target him because he was Jewish?” He said it was up to the justice system to determine this. Serfati said that, as a lawyer, he did not want the case to be a focal point for politicians. “I am only looking for the truth from the justice system, to identify and arrest the attackers and for them to face justice.” Eric Mathais, the state prosecutor in Bobigny, confirmed that an investigation had been opened into the violent attack. “The hypothesis that the victim had crossed the tram tracks to escape his attacks was naturally taken into account,” he said. In a press conference on Tuesday, the Bobigny prosecutor said there was no certainty at this stage of the investigation that there were “discriminatory” motives behind the attack or that the victim was wearing a kippah at the time. He said more witnesses would be interviewed.",News/News,French politicians denounce death of Jewish man in possible antisemitic attack,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/apr/05/french-politicians-denounce-death-of-jewish-man-in-possible-antisemitic-attack
4/6/2022,"The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, has announced hate crime charges relating to assaults against seven Asian American women in New York City in February. Steven Zajonc, 28, has been charged in New York state supreme court with six felony counts of assault in the third degree as a hate crime and seven counts of aggravated harassment in the second degree as a misdemeanor hate crime. On 27 February, it is alleged, Zajonc punched, shoved and elbowed seven Asian women in Manhattan without provocation. The first attack occurred at 6.30pm in midtown, when a 57-year-old Asian woman was punched in the face. The woman suffered swelling to her left cheek and a cut lip, authorities said. Zajonc is alleged to have approached a 25-year-old Asian woman near Fifth Avenue and East 30th Street 10 minutes later, hitting her in the face and the back of the arm. He is alleged to have repeated the pattern several times over the next hour, hitting young Asian women – aged 21, 25, 19 and 25 – in the face, shoving another woman, aged 20, to the ground near Broadway and East 8th Street, then fleeing westward. Zajonc was arrested a few days later outside a library in midtown Manhattan, after two security guards recognized him from surveillance videos. “These attacks on seven New York women, each fueled by anti-Asian hate, are yet another sobering reminder of the demonstrable fears AAPI [Asian American and Pacific Islander] communities, particularly AAPI women, in our city continue to face,” Bragg said. “This indictment is a result of our collaboration with the NYPD’s Hate Crimes Task Force and, critically, assistance from the brave witnesses and victims who came forward to stand up against hate. My office is a safe place to report crimes regardless of your immigration status.” Six of the victims suffered injuries, among them bleeding lacerations and facial bruising. Another was knocked unconscious and treated for concussion. The Manhattan DA’s office has 27 open hate crime cases related to anti-Asian hate crimes. Across the US, anti-AAPI hate crime was up 339% last year. Last August, Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition that tracks and responds to racially motivated hate crimes, said more than 9,000 anti-Asian incidents had been reported since March 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic spread to the US from China. New York City has seen an alarming rise in violence against Asian Americans. Four have died. They were: GuiYing Ma, 62, who was attacked by a man with a rock in Queens; Yao Pan Ma, 61, who was attacked while collecting cans in East Harlem; Michelle Go, 40, who was pushed on to subway tracks at Times Square; and Christina Yuna Lee, 35, who was stabbed 40 times in her Chinatown apartment.",News/World news,New York man charged with hate crimes for attacks on seven Asian American women,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/new-york-man-charged-hate-crimes-attacks-seven-asian-american-women
4/6/2022,"Rishi Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murthy, have donated more than £100,000 to the chancellor’s old private school, Winchester college. The private boys’ boarding school, which costs £43,335 a year to attend, revealed the donation in its annual journal. A spokesperson for Sunak said: “Rishi and his wife have donated to numerous charities and philanthropic causes for many years and will continue to do so. These donations are made to help fund scholarships for children who would not otherwise have the opportunity to go to Winchester.” The school’s journal from 2020 also put him in the list of benefactors who have donated more than £100,000 in total, suggesting he has been a regular donor. Speaking of his private education at Winchester, where he was head boy, Sunak told Sky last month: “I was really lucky to have that opportunity. It was something that was really extraordinary, it certainly put my life on a different trajectory. “As I said, it’s part of the reason I’m sitting here and I’m really grateful to have had that opportunity. And I look back on that time. It’s helped make me who I am as a person, and it helps me do the job in the way that I do it. And it confirms to me that education is one of the best tools at our disposal in politics to spread opportunity.” Labour highlighted Sunak’s previous claim that he had “maxed out” on how much support he could give state schools, while continuing to hand subsidies to “elitist private schools” through tax breaks. Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, said: “Britain should have the best state schools in the world. But after 12 years of Tory neglect four in 10 of our children leave school without the qualifications they need. “Labour would end the tax giveaway Rishi Sunak hands out to his old boys’ network and use the money to improve every state school instead, ensuring everyone leaves education ready for work and ready for life.” Sunak’s personal wealth has recently come under scrutiny over investments his wife holds in Infosys, which had business in Russia. Murthy holds an estimated £690m stake in the Indian IT services company and collects about £11.5m in annual dividends. The Guardian reported last week that it was “urgently” closing its office in Russia. Pressure had been mounting on Sunak to answer accusations that his family was collecting “blood money” dividends from the firm’s continued operation in Russia despite the invasion of Ukraine. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, called on the chancellor to reveal whether his family had been “benefiting from money made in Russia when the government has put in place sanctions” on firms and individuals. After scrutiny of his wife’s holding in Infosys, Sunak told the BBC’s Newscast that it was “very upsetting and … wrong for people to try and come at my wife”.",News/Politics,"Rishi Sunak and wife donate over £100,000 to Winchester college",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/05/rishi-sunak-and-wife-donate-over-100000-to-winchester-college
4/6/2022,"Peru’s embattled president Pedro Castillo has banned residents of the capital, Lima, from leaving their homes in an attempt to quell nationwide protests over soaring fuel and fertiliser prices caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In a televised address just before midnight on Monday, Castillo announced a curfew from 2am until 11.59pm on Tuesday, claiming the measure would “protect the fundamental rights of all people”. Castillo said the curfew was a response to “violent acts certain groups have created by blocking free transit” on roads in and out of the capital, where about a third of Peru’s 33 million citizens live. But the move has been widely criticised as excessive and improvised and a sign of Castillo’s increasingly shaky grip on power. In just eight months in office, he has survived two impeachment attempts and rattled through four cabinets and an unprecedented number of ministers. The schoolteacher from a peasant farmer family narrowly won the election last year with the backing of the rural poor. Now many of his former supporters, among them farmers and transport workers, are driving the protests into their second week, while the government strives to bring prices down. Peru is not the only South American country where the Ukraine war is having a political and social impact.Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, and his allies have been trying to use the conflict to accelerate the passing of highly controversial legislation that would allow commercial mining on Indigenous land. “This crisis between Ukraine and Russia … has thrown up a good opportunity for us,” Bolsonaro said last month, arguing that potash reserves on protected Indigenous lands needed exploiting after Russia’s decision to suspend the export of fertilisers desperately needed by Brazil’s farm sector. Experts reject such logic, noting that only a small proportion of Brazil’s potash reserves are found beneath Indigenous territories. “It’s a pretext – an excuse,” said Márcio Astrini, the executive secretary of Brazil’s Climate Observatory, a network of environmental groups that oppose the legislation.“What Bolsonaro is doing is taking advantage of a situation in order to create a fallacious argument and speed up the voting of a bill which is motivated by other interests, involving wanting to take these lands away from Indigenous communities and privatize them,” Astrini added. Thousands of Indigenous activists are gathering in Brazil’s capital this week for a 10-day protest camp partly designed to convince members of congress to block the mining legislation. “We will not retreat,” one of their leaders, Sônia Guajajara, said on Monday as representatives of 200 of Brazil’s 305 Indigenous peoples began to arrive in Brasília. Castillo’s curfew in Peru has sparked unfavourable comparisons as it falls on the 30th anniversary of the infamous “self-coup”, or “auto-golpe”, when in 1992, the now jailed former president Alberto Fujimori dissolved congress, assumed extraordinary powers and sent tanks and soldiers on to the streets. Peru’s human rights ombudsman demanded the government lift the unconstitutional and “absolutely disproportionate” curfew. At least four people have been killed in the protests which spread from the rural Andes to the capital. On Monday, protesters burned toll booths and fought police near Ica, about 300km south of Lima. The unrest erupted last week as farmers and lorry drivers blocked roads into Lima, triggering a jump in food prices. Inflation in Peru hit a 26-year high on Friday with consumer prices rising 1.48% last month. Over the weekend, the government responded by trying to lower fuel prices by waiving taxes. Peru – which imports 1.2m tonnes of fertilisers a year – issued an emergency declaration for its agricultural sector due to rising fertiliser prices triggered by western sanctions on Russia, a major exporter of soil nutrients.",News/World news,Fuel protests prompt Lima curfew as Ukraine crisis touches South America,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/peru-lima-curfew-brazil-ukraine-fuel-fertiliser
4/6/2022,"A woman died after being struck by a traditional hobby horse costume during a May Day celebration in Cornwall, an inquest has heard. Laura Smallwood, a paediatric nurse, was injured when she was bumped by an “obby oss”, one of a pair used in the centuries-old festival held at Padstow, north Cornwall, on 1 May 2019. The obby oss is made from a wooden frame covered in black oilskin with a small horse’s head featuring a snapping jaw. A blue oss and red oss process around the town on May Day. One witness, Sian Howells, told the hearing in Truro that it was at the point where the two osses meet that the incident happened. She said: “Laura had gone behind the oss. All of a sudden the oss moved backwards. It is very unusual for it to go backwards. As it fell Laura was standing with her back to the oss. “The one thing you are always told is not to have your back to the oss. Most people face the oss with their hands out. I could see it coming towards her, the rim of the oss hitting the back of her neck. She was knocked over and it looked like she fell to the ground.” Kevin Constance, who was carrying the obby oss, said he fell backwards “on to my bum”. Constance, who has been involved in the processions or 40 years since he was 16, said: “Everything was fine, for some reason I felt myself going backwards. I did not trip at the time. It does not happen very often at all but it did on this occasion. I was sober. I was not aware of hitting anybody. I could only see forward.” He was helped up and continued on his way “completely unaware” of the incident with Smallwood. Constance, who has been honorary secretary of the May Day celebrations for 22 years, told the coroner that May Day in Padstow was more popular than Christmas Day but admitted it was like Bovril – “you either love it or hate it”. The senior Cornwall coroner Andrew Cox said the inquest would look at whether Smallwood died as a consequence of injuries sustained in her clash with the oss. He said another explanation was that she suffered from injuries caused during an altercation earlier that evening outside one of the celebrity chef Rick Stein’s businesses in the town. The coroner said Smallwood may have sustained injuries caused by an unidentified event about 10 days earlier, or a fourth possibility was that she sustained some injuries in “some other way”. Another witness, Charlotte Stupple, said that after the incident with the oss, Smallwood felt dizzy. She said: “Thirty seconds later Laura grabbed my arm and said: ‘Charlotte, my face.’ I could see the right side of her face by her mouth had dropped.” He breathing became laboured and she was taken to hospital.” The inquest heard that Smallwood’s husband, Oliver, wanted to know if the event management was organised adequately and whether any changes had been made. He said his wife was a caring, fun, happy and strong person who had no medical conditions or illnesses.

4/6/2022,"A Ukrainian scientist who works for a top British university says she feels “profoundly let down” by the UK government after waiting seven weeks for a visa while Russians bombed the area near her home in Odesa. Olena Said, who manages clinical trials at King’s College London, applied to move to the UK days before the Russian invasion but her application has been tied up in red tape. She applied on 17 February under a priority scheme meant to fast track skilled workers under the UK’s post-Brexit points-based immigration system. However, she is still waiting for a decision. Said, 38, and her 74-year-old mother fled to neighbouring Moldova six weeks ago after their region of Odesa was one of the first places bombed by the Russians. She said: “I feel profoundly let down by the whole system. It just feels like it is stuck in limbo somewhere and there’s no way to know what is the truth any more.” Said, who has a PhD in clinical pharmacology, manages a clinical trial on the treatment of eating disorders at King’s College London’s Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, where she has worked since August 2021. Dr Hubertus Himmerich, a clinical senior lecturer who works with Said at KCL, said the trial she was running “might lead to a scientific and medical breakthrough” in the pharmacological treatment of anorexia nervosa. He added: “It is heartbreaking that a highly qualified medical researcher like Lena is currently not allowed to enter the UK and is prevented from continuing research that might save young lives. Said came to the UK in September 2020 on a student visa to complete a master’s at University College London. She had to return temporarily to Ukraine in January when her student visa expired. She then applied for a skilled worker visa, sponsored by King’s College, to move to the UK permanently. Now stuck in the Moldovan capital, Chișinău, Said said she was “trying to survive day to day”. She and her British partner, Richard Beenham, have tried to find out the status of her visa but have been given conflicting responses from junior UK visas and immigration officials. She said: “It’s a massive disgrace. I’m checking my emails probably thousands of times a day just in the hope that I can go back to the place where I have what resembles a normal life and not stuck in a country where there is nothing for me, no work, no family. It feels incredibly isolating and devastating that [there is a] lack of caring from people who have the power to direct how someone’s life goes.” Official figures show that, as of last Thursday, the UK has issued visas to 45% of the 65,000 Ukrainians who have applied under the Homes for Ukraine scheme or the family scheme. However, only 4,700 visas have been issued of the 32,200 applications under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which the government launched to great fanfare on 18 March. Leading charities have called on the government to waive visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees as a short-term measure to bring the UK in line with the EU. More than 4.2 million Ukrainians have fled to neighbouring countries since the invasion, according to the UN’s refugee agency. About 6.5 million people are displaced internally within Ukraine. Kate Larmer, who co-founded Farnham Homes for Ukraine to match those fleeing war with homes in Surrey, said the UK’s “heinous” visa requirements were adding to people’s emotional distress. Her group has submitted 136 visa applications on behalf of Ukrainians, including dozens of children, but only six have been issued, she said. Most of the 136 have been waiting for more than two weeks, and a “significant proportion” for more than three weeks. A government spokesperson said it was “moving as quickly as possible” to get Ukrainians to the UK. He added: “We have streamlined the process so valid passport holders do not have to attend in-person appointments before arriving in the UK, simplified our forms and boosted caseworker numbers, while ensuring vital security checks are carried out. “We continue to speed up visa processing across both schemes, with almost 30,000 visas issued in the last three weeks alone and thousands more expected to come through these uncapped routes.”",News/UK news,Ukraine scientist ‘profoundly let down’ by UK after seven-week visa wait,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/05/ukraine-scientist-profoundly-let-down-by-uk-after-seven-week-visa-wait
4/6/2022,"Of all the upsides that come with the BBC having two dedicated children’s channels, there is one small loss. Unless you have children or grandchildren, you are unlikely to accidentally discover a brilliant new kids’ show like, say, hungover students discovered Teletubbies in the 1990s. The only way that might happen now is if someone makes a children’s show so fantastic that it gets passed all the way up to the main channels. Dodger is that show. Created by Rhys Thomas (best known for creating the BBC mockumentary Brian Pern) and written with his wife, the actor Lucy Montgomery, Dodger is technically a prequel to Oliver. But it’s more than an origin story for the Artful Dodger. The show is loaded with acting talent – Christopher Eccleston plays Fagin, David Threlfall is the chief of police, with Julian Barratt, Alexei Sayle and Frances Barber popping up along the way. The whole thing clatters along breathlessly like an episodic version of The Goonies. Hence its promotion from CBBC to BBC One. “That was a lovely surprise,” says Montgomery via Zoom, from a location she describes as a hut in Norfolk. “Thanks BBC.” “iPlayer is where it’s all at really, in terms of the future,” adds Thomas, from the comfort of their home in London. “But it’s been nice because BBC One has a tradition of Sunday night family things.” “And you can watch it with your gran,” Montgomery chimes in. “We’ve tried to make it in the way you can watch The Simpsons, so there’ll be things that adults will get that kids won’t get. It being on BBC One means, hopefully, we’ll have adults of all ages enjoying it as well.” You only have to spend a couple of seconds with Thomas and Montgomery to see where Dodger gets its breakneck pace. They gabber and froth as if they are running out of time, hopping in to finish each other’s sentences and at times talk over each other. Their enthusiasm for Dodger is contagious. “Lucy was only going to write a couple of episodes at the start,” says Thomas. “But we work so well together, we basically said let’s do all of them together.” “We’ve written on our own a lot, and we’ve also written with other people where they maybe don’t pull their weight, or you can’t be honest,” says Montgomery. “But obviously we know each other so well that it works. And we can also bore our kids by constantly talking about Dodger storylines, to the point where our daughter wrote Fuck Dodger on the whiteboard.” As well as writing the show, Thomas and Montgomery both have small parts. Additionally, Thomas directed all the episodes. That has to be a challenge in itself, I say, to simultaneously direct children who have never acted before and also some of the best actors in the world. “It was interesting because this was the first time Christopher Eccleston had to work with children on that level too,” replies Thomas. “It’s a big comedy part and he’s playing the centre point because Fagin is both mother and father to these kids, so he was going through a process doing all this for the first time.” “But he’s got young kids and he’s proud that they love this, and he wants to do it for them as well,” adds Montgomery. “He was really great with the children. Sometimes he’d be like, ‘Feel the camera, feel where the camera is.’ For some of them, this was their first acting job and here they are with Christopher Eccleston giving them an acting masterclass.” The children clearly also benefited from Thomas’s patient direction. Even if he does refer to how stressful it was to attempt a project like this: “I can’t believe I’m still alive, really.” “Rhys has got so much energy that he could drive the whole thing,” says Montgomery. “We have worked with some directors who just sit there next to the monitor eating sandwiches. But Rhys was right in there. He was like Spielberg on ET with Thingy Thomas.” “Thanks, Lucy,” replies Rhys, who looks touched for a moment before correcting her. “Henry Thomas. He was also Norman Bates in Psycho 4, the TV movie.” Dodger features some phenomenal performances from the younger cast members. Billy Jenkins who plays the Artful Dodger is especially fantastic, more Del Boy than Dickens. Ellie-May Sheridan, who plays Fagin’s pre-Dodger favourite, Polly Crackitt, got a recurring role on Call the Midwife and Connor Curren, who plays gang member Tom Chitling, is doing a National Theatre tour of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. It is telling that both Thomas and Montgomery glow with pride when they talk about all the big roles these actors have since picked up. What makes Dodger’s success all the more miraculous is that the target audience is difficult to define. Whereas CBeebies, in a sense, is a benevolent dictator, serving high-quality shows to viewers too young to have a say in what they watch, by the time they graduate to CBBC, they are deluged with options. Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, streaming, games and whatever horrors happen to be on YouTube on any given day. But Dodger, silly and mildly scary and irresistible, manages to hit the sweet spot. Along with Silverpoint, a wonderful sci-fi show that is half The Returned and half The Tripods, it feels like we’re living through a CBBC renaissance. “This is why we did it for the BBC,” says Thomas. “We didn’t go anywhere else with it. First, I’m one of those old-fashioned people who really believes in the BBC. It does have a duty to educate and entertain, and that’s what we tried to do. There are a lot of facts in Dodger, and you can learn from it. Everything in there is factually correct, and we did a BBC Teach tie-in with the show, so you can actually watch it and have a history lesson.” “The only criticism we’ve had has been from a few people saying they won’t watch because we’ve got a multiracial cast,” adds Thomas. “There’s that brigade who say, ‘Zero stars because there weren’t black people in England in 19 …’” “London has always been a melting pot,” sighs Montgomery. “And they don’t like that there are girls in the gang.” “It’s so stupid. I hate those people,” says Thomas. Although a second series hasn’t been confirmed, the mosaic of multicoloured Post-its on the wall behind Thomas suggests that the couple are putting ideas together. What is the future of Dodger? Will their rambunctious iteration finally catch up with Dickens and introduce Oliver Twist? “No, we don’t want to do that, it’s boring,” says Thomas. “The idea is, we would never get to that point. I mean, if we were really scraping the bottom of the barrel we might go ‘OK, let’s do the Oliver Twist story.’ I really want Dodger to be this age for a long time.” That won’t happen, of course. The problem with making a show about kids on the cusp of puberty is that, very soon, they will be in puberty. “Rhys had a pickup day [extra day of shooting] on the mud flats, and we noticed that Billy looked older. And you suddenly go, ‘Oh my God, he’s a proper 14-year-old’.” Perhaps this is what makes Dodger such fun. It bulges at the seams with ideas, because it’s made by people who don’t know if they will have another shot at making something that means so much to them. Still, on the basis of Dodger’s reception so far, that won’t be a problem.

4/6/2022,"The tanks rolled into Trostianets, a sleepy town 20 miles from the Russia-Ukraine border, in the first hours of the invasion. Russian troops fanned out across the town, occupying a number of buildings: the forestry agency headquarters, the railway station and a chocolate factory. Their top general set up his office in room 23 at the local administration building, where the council’s accountants used to sit. His bottle of single malt is still on the desk, the butts of his slim cigarettes perched on the edge of an ashtray. He slept on a single bed stolen from a nearby hotel. His men lived one floor below. They appear to have slept, eaten and defecated in the same rooms, and some of them may have died there too, judging by the bloodied Russian uniforms littering the floor. Thirty days after they arrived, amid a fierce Ukrainian counteroffensive, the Russians left Trostianets in a convoy of tanks, other armour, trucks full of loot and numerous stolen vehicles they had daubed with Z signs, the symbol of their invading force. The carnage they left behind will be remembered by the residents of this quaint, historical spa town of 20,000 residents for the rest of their lives, and is yet another indictment of the results of Russia’s unwanted “liberation” mission in Ukraine. In the square outside the train station, there is now a grim panorama of several mangled tanks, the whitened carcass of a self-propelled howitzer and a shot-up yellow bus with blood smeared on the seats. Hundreds of green ammunition boxes and casings remain, evidence of the shells and Grad missiles the Russians fired from Trostianets into neighbouring towns. Surviving buildings have been daubed with pro-Russian slogans, and crude insults about the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. On a two-day visit to the town, the Guardian found evidence of summary executions, torture and systematic looting during the month of occupation, but it will a take a long time to catalogue all the crimes the Russians committed in places like Trostianets. For now, the long and difficult clean-up is under way. Ukrainian sappers have removed mines and tripwires from the cemetery, the train station and even the chocolate museum, housed in an elegant villa where the composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky once stayed. Electricity returned for the first time in weeks on Sunday. The first passenger train since the invasion arrived at the wrecked station on Monday. But the streets are still littered with the twisted remains of Russian armoured vehicles, and there is nothing to buy because everything has been looted. Over the weekend, residents wheeled bicycles to the points across town where parcels of food aid are available: cartons of eggs, jars of pickled cucumbers and plastic bags bulging with potatoes, sent by volunteer groups in other parts of Ukraine. In the orderly but irritable queue to receive them, people embraced acquaintances who they were happy to see still alive, and swapped horror stories from the past month. Spotting a journalist, ever more people joined in, shouting over each other. “They smashed my place up.” “They stole everything, even my underwear.” “They killed a guy on my street.” “The fuckers stole my laptop and my aftershave.” A symphony of stories, some of them personal, some of them second-hand, all of them awful. This is a place where a decade ago, people had mostly good things to say about Russia, which is just a short drive away and where many people have friends and family. Now they competed to heap insults on the neighbours that had brought misery upon them. “Barbarians!” “Pigs!” “Bastards!” Yuriy Bova, the mayor of Trostianets, said it was too early to give a reliable estimate of how many civilians the Russians had killed. It was “definitely more than 50, but probably not hundreds”, he said. Bova now struts about town in fatigues, a pistol tucked into the front of his body armour. At the time of the invasion, however, he cut a very different figure. The idea of a Russian invasion had seemed fanciful to him, he admitted. Nonetheless, as the crescendo of US intelligence warnings continued, he called a meeting of those who would like to join a territorial defence force. About 100 people turned up. There are no military installations in Trostianets, and between them, they had a few hunting rifles, a couple of pistols and a few policemen with Kalashnikovs. They agreed to ask Kyiv for weapons. But it was already too late. Three nights later, the invasion began. By breakfast time, a huge column of Russian armour was already on the outskirts of the town. Bova sent a group of foresters to cut down trees along the entrance road, which won them a few hours, and in mid-morning he called another meeting of the territorial defence unit. “Trying to fight against tanks with a few rifles would have meant certain death, so I took the decision that we would become partisans,” said Bova. People had a few minutes to decide whether they would stay or go. The mayor and his deputies left town, retreating to neighbouring villages. When Ukrainian forces blew up a bridge to the south of Trostianets, it stalled Russia’s advance plans, and the town became a hub of Russian servicemen and armour. Local residents retreated to their basements and waited to see what would happen. Some of the first interactions with the occupiers were relatively painless, residents reported. “We were scared of them, but after a while we started pitying them. They had dirty faces, they stank and they looked completely lost,” said Yana Lugovets, who spent a month sleeping in the basement with her husband, daughter and friends. She said a soldier who had come to search the house where they were staying left without completing the task, his eyes filled with shame as her daughter cried out in fear at the intruder. Daria Sasina, 26, who ran a beauty salon near the train station, said when she went to check on it and found seven Russian soldiers had broken in and were sleeping there, they were initially apologetic. “I started crying, I was in hysterics. There was a young soldier, and he calmed me down. He said: ‘Listen, I’m sorry. We didn’t know it would be like this.’” Many people recalled similar polite exchanges, or flickers of shame in the eyes of the intruders, but any interaction with the occupiers involved enduring a game of Russian roulette. A few days later, when Sasina, her husband and father went on a risky mission across town to deliver bread to a 96-year-old great aunt, a group of Russian soldiers sprang onto the street behind them and pointed their weapons at them. “There were 20 of them, and they started shouting: “Run, bitches!” We ran through the mud as fast as we could, our legs were freezing and soaked and we were terrified. They started shooting in the air. We could hear them laughing, they thought it was hilarious.” When Sasina went back to check on her small salon the day after the Russians had left, she found they had stolen thousands of dollars worth of expensive hair dyes, shampoos and nail polishes, the hairdryers, all the cutting equipment, a sofa, all the chairs, several lightbulbs and the art on the walls. An air conditioning unit was left dangling down from the wall, its cables having proved stronger than the desire to steal it. In return, the Russians had left clumps of their own shaved hair on the floor, and piles of faeces in the neighbouring grocery shop. Somewhere in Russia, the wives and girlfriends of soldiers will presumably soon receive gifts of high-end beauty products. For Sasina, she does not know how she will afford to rebuild her salon. “Everything I worked to build has been destroyed,” she said. The mayor has been criticised by some for his decision to flee, but Bova insists it was the only sensible option. Flicking through photographs on his phone from the occupation days, he showed how people had sent him information about Russian deployments, including from one brave local who managed to fly a drone over their positions. “People told us where they’re sleeping, where they’re eating, where their hardware is,” said Bova. As the Ukrainian army called in strikes on the Russian positions, the Russians became more and more angry. An expletive-laden audio recording released by the Ukrainian security services purportedly shows a Russian general ordering a missile strike on civilian targets after receiving incoming fire from a nearby village. “Wipe the whole place from the Earth from the eastern side to the west,” he says. As they came under fire more frequently, the Russians cut mobile reception in the town, and went house to house, demanding to examine people’s telephones for compromising information. A handwritten note found amid the mess of the soldiers’ quarters in the train station lists the names of possible enemies to hunt down, with extremely vague identifiers, such as “drives a white off-road vehicle”. In Bilka, a quiet, windswept hamlet just outside Trostianets, where the Russians based more than 200 vehicles, at least two people were executed. Alexander Kulybaba, a pig farmer who protested against the takeover of his barn, was shot on the spot on 2 March, the day the Russians arrived in the village. Mykola Savchenko, a kindly electrician with a handlebar moustache, who together with his wife Ludmyla had six foster children, went out on the first morning to find somewhere to charge his and his wife’s mobile phones because the electricity was already down. “I’m just popping out for five minutes,” he told her. He never came back. Ludmyla stood outside her home weeping on Monday, holding a stamped death report from the police that explained in neat handwriting that her husband had been “brutally tortured and then killed with a shot to the heart and one to the head”. An inspection found broken bones in his fingers and arms. “I didn’t say anything to the children, because they are small and they still don’t understand everything. Every day they waited for their dad to come home, but he never did. Yesterday, I said to them: ‘Sit down, I will explain everything,’” she said. The youngest of her six children is four, the eldest 11. They stood alongside her, lined up like nesting dolls, silent and confused. Ludmyla insisted her husband had not been active in the resistance to the Russians, but many locals were. On a nearby street, a farmer explained how he hid his smartphone in the dirt inside the pig enclosure, and carried round an old brick phone as a decoy to show to Russian soldiers if asked. Then, in the darkness of night, he would dig up his real phone, scurry to the one spot where he knew there was still reception, and send the new locations of Russian hardware to a relative in the Ukrainian army. “Then they sent in the Bayraktars and fucked them up,” he said with a cackle, referring to the Turkish-made drones that Ukraine has used with deadly effect against Russian columns. “The Russians are dogs, they are subhumans, they are locusts,” he said. The boiling fury felt towards the Russians in villages such as Bilka, where people speak a mishmash of Ukrainian and Russian and previously felt far removed from geopolitical concerns, will be a lasting consequence of Vladimir Putin’s grim decision to invade. Along with the anger, there is confusion and disappointment about the attitudes of ordinary Russians. Nadezhda Bakran, 73, a nurse in the local hospital, cowered in the hospital’s basement together with her patients, as a Russian tank took potshots at the building, which is now empty and wrecked. Her nearby apartment block has also been reduced to a skeleton, with all the windows blown out and serious structural damage. But when she called her best friend in Moscow, with whom she has been on holiday almost every year since they met in Crimea 43 years ago, she heard only sceptical derision and accusations. “I tried to explain it to her, but she doesn’t believe me. She believes her television. I said: ‘Your people are destroying my town’. She said: ‘You caused this war yourself’… We were friends, what we had was even closer than just friendship, and she doesn’t believe me. I don’t understand.” For many, this sense of betrayal from their friends and family has hit almost as hard as the material losses. Sasina, the beauty-salon owner, listed the losses her family had taken from a month of Russian occupation: her house was destroyed, her beauty salon looted, her mother’s toy shop also looted, her friend’s car stolen, daubed with Zs and then smashed up. Her brother now walks on crutches after his car was shot at on the first day at a checkpoint and a bullet lodged in his lower back. Russian soldiers even shot her grandmother’s cat during a house inspection, she said. When Sasina called her aunt, who lives outside Moscow and had visited her in Trostianets most summers, to inform her of the horrors unfolding, her aunt told her she was talking nonsense. “She said it’s not possible, she said probably the soldiers are Ukrainians dressed up as Russians. She has stopped speaking to me now,” Sasine said, shaking her head in disbelief. The Russian soldiers who made it out of Trostianets alive may never speak about the anger they witnessed and the carnage they caused, as they return to a country where their operation in Ukraine has been referred to by state propaganda as a heroic mission to save their neighbour from the clutches of radicals and neo-Nazis. Russian television viewers may never see the ugly truth of the cost of their army’s unwanted intervention, although many Russian families will now be mourning lost sons and brothers. The yellowed bodies of three Russian soldiers lie unclaimed and unrefrigerated in the Trostianets hospital morgue. A Ukrainian soldier involved in retaking the town estimated that up to 300 may have died here. In the basement of the train station, weak torchlight reveals an improvised field hospital where the Russians treated their wounded. Silver padding had been placed over two desks to create makeshift operating tables. The floor was littered with tablets and other medical supplies. A medical drip remained, fastened to a coat stand. On the wall in the corridor outside was perhaps the most jarring sight in all Trostianets. Children’s drawings brought from Russia were taped to the wall, gifts from schoolchildren in honour of Army Day, the day before Russia’s invasion. The cards were decorated with pretty, colourful flowers and messages of support written in spidery youthful handwriting. One was signed by Sasha P, first grade, and came with drawings in crayon and a printed message. It read: “Thank you, soldier, for making sure I live under a peaceful sky.”",News/World news,‘Barbarians’: Russian troops leave grisly mark on town of Trostianets,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/barbarians-russian-troops-leave-grisly-mark-on-ukraine-town-of-trostianets
4/6/2022,"Stephen Colbert celebrated the Late Show’s bandleader Jon Batiste on Monday evening, a day after Batiste won five Grammys, including album of the year for We Are. “I’m not surprised at all that Jon won album of the year,” the host said. “You know who was surprised? Jon.” “You can tell he didn’t expect to go on stage because he wore his most casual rhinestone bishop’s vestments,” Colbert said of Batiste’s sparkly outfit, worn for his album of the year acceptance for the ceremony’s finale. During his acceptance speech, Batiste spoke of his lifelong love of music: “I love music. I’ve been playing since I was a little boy. It’s more than entertainment for me; it’s a spiritual practice.” “That is lovely,” said Colbert. “Also, I’d like to apologize to Jon for interrupting his spiritual practice for years with jokes about Rudy Giuliani’s wine-soaked buffoonery.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy also appeared at the Grammys in a pre-taped address, and urged viewers to support Ukraine. “Fill the silence with your music!” he said. “Fill it today. To tell our story.” “Adding ‘But not you, Kanye, we’re dealing with enough already,’” joked Colbert. Colbert then checked in on the war in Ukraine, where Russia has almost completely retreated from the area surrounding Kyiv. “That is good news, admittedly, but now that they’ve pulled out, the world is getting a close look at the horrific path of destruction the Russians have left behind,” he said. Colbert wouldn’t show any footage as it’s “not safe for humans” but Ukrainian officials described the destruction as “genocide” and have launched an investigation into possible Russian war crimes. “I’m going to save everybody some time and pull the ‘possible’ out of that sentence,” said Colbert. “It’s for sure war crimes. Investigation done. It’s settled.” “Let’s move on to something less obvious,” he continued, “like figuring out if a bear poops in the woods, of course if it’s a Russian bear they call it a Special Military Defecation.” On Late Night, Seth Meyers tore into Mike Pence, who appeared on Fox News on Saturday and claimed that “President Biden has done more damage to America than any president in modern history.” “Wow, how strict is your definition of modern history?” Meyers wondered, breaking out his Pence impression: “Modern history is everything since The Slap. Then from 900 AD to The Slap, that’s the middle ages.” “Seriously, man, what’s your deal?” he continued. “You’re still trying to win over Trump voters? They stormed the Capitol and they chanted ‘hang Mike Pence.’ That’s you! You’re like a guy who gets a fake number from a woman at a bar and keeps calling it hoping to get a date.” “Maybe Pence thinks Biden is worse than Trump because he was asleep for the entire Trump presidency,” he mused, “which is possible given that every meeting he had his eyes closed like he was desperately hoping no one would notice him.” “These Trump toadies are all such obsequious little worms, but Pence’s faux gravitas makes him that much more insufferable,” Meyers added. “The head-shaking, the solemn tone, the put-on folksy demeanor – he looks and moves like a Chuck-E-Cheese robot who tells the band to keep it down.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel mocked Donald Trump for ripping off his own White House photographer. Although it is customary for modern presidents to allow their photographer to profit from their work with post-office commemorative books, aides for Trump reportedly asked his White House photographer, Shealah Craighead, for a cut of her book deal. Trump’s office then told her to hold off on publishing her book, and published her photos before her for $75 a pop without photo credit. “Fortunately, she has a lot of pictures of the guy who robbed her, and he looks just like Donald Trump,” Kimmel quipped. “Two least surprising things about this story: one, Trump’s profiting from the work of someone else,” he added. “And two, the memoir he published about his time in office is a picture book.” In other Trump news, the former president endorsed Sarah Palin for Congress over the weekend. As Trump said in a statement: “Sarah Palin is tough and smart and will never back down.” “Even for Trump, it’s impressive to fit three lies in an eleven-word sentence,” said Kimmel. “I guess the Masked Singer money dried up and Sarah is running for office. Trump endorsing Sarah Palin is like paste-eating endorsing glue-sniffing. It’s ridiculous.”",Arts/Culture,Stephen Colbert on possible Russian war crimes: ‘Save time and pull the “possible” out of that sentence’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/05/stephen-colbert-russia-war-crimes-late-night-tv
