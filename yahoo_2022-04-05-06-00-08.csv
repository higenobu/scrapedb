4/5/2022,"This story contains graphic descriptions and images. While most of the world gasped at the latest round of atrocities perpetrated by invading Russian troops in Ukraine, Kremlin propagandists and government officials are only doubling down. The shocking footage of the massacre that took place in the Ukrainian city of Bucha was repeatedly broadcast on Russian state television this week with the label “Fake” slapped across the screen. During Monday’s broadcast of state TV show 60 Minutes, host Olga Skabeeva speculated that the town was chosen for an elaborate fabrication because of its name. “Biden said that Putin is a butcher. Bucha sounds like “butcher.” How could they not take advantage of such a town?” She later added: “President Putin described them all as “the Empire of lies,” and here is our confirmation.” The so-called “lies” Skabeeva is referring to are the scenes of indescribable horror that were discovered by Ukrainian troops who arrived in Bucha this weekend after the Russian Army withdrew from the city. Scores of bodies, including those of women and children, were littered on roads and in yards, many of them found with their hands bound behind their backs and signs of rape or torture. Dead bodies of five men are pictured, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues, in the town of Bucha, outside Kyiv, Ukraine, April 4, 2022. Russian state media churned out ridiculous assertions, claiming in part that the corpses of women and children depicted in the footage from Bucha—some of which were charred beyond recognition—were “moving their arms,” “getting their limbs out of the way to avoid the wheels of military vehicles” or even “getting up and walking away.” While scenes from Bucha made headlines around the world, Interfax published a report on a ceremony conducted by the Russian military on April 2, in which several awards were presented to the Airborne Forces (VDV) of the Russian Federation in the Kyiv region. According to state TV outlet Zvezda, that unit had been involved in “holding back the actions of the enemy forces” and “performing the cleaning of settlements” in Bucha. “In the Kyiv region, in the area where the tasks of the formation of the Airborne Forces were performed, the awarding of Russian paratroopers took place.The commander of the formation presented state awards to servicemen who distinguished themselves in combat missions during this special military operation,” the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement about the awards. Horrific New Details of Carnage in Ukraine Town Emerge The same day, the media outlet Ria Fan published the names of seven Russian soldiers to its listing of “Z Heroes.” The state TV program Vesti Nedeli, hosted by Dmitry Kiselyov, showcased the medals awarded to the invading troops: ""For Courage"", “Suvorov” and “Zhukov.” Immediately, participants of the state TV show Sunday Evening With Vladimir Soloviev jumped to heap praise upon the Russian troops and called for various rewards and bonuses, from debt forgiveness to pay raises. Instead of shaming the killers of Ukrainian civilians, Mikheyev loudly asserted: “We need to support them!” He added: “We need to raise their salaries, because they’re risking their lives! Their consumer debts should be written off... During war, we need to support the Russian warrior.” Despite overwhelming evidence of the massacre, the Russian Defense Ministry has claimed that “not a single local in Bucha” suffered any harm while the town was under control of the Russian Armed Forces. During his meeting with UN Deputy Secretary General Martin Griffiths on Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the extensive evidence of Russia’s war crimes “a staged production, organized on the streets,” which is being used “for anti-Russian purposes.” The same day, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov asserted: “From what we have seen, the video materials cannot be trusted in many respects, because our specialists from the Ministry of Defense have identified signs of video fraud and all sorts of fakes.” Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed that the videos from Bucha “were fabricated and are a provocation,” claiming that Russian troops left Bucha on March 30. Despite Russia’s denials, satellite images obtained by The New York Times confirmed that bodies of massacred civilians lay in the streets of Bucha for weeks, while the town was in full control of the Russian troops. Meanwhile, on his Sunday show, host Vladimir Soloviev angrily yelled that the goal of the West is a total destruction of Russia. He demanded: “Don’t get in the way of our Army’s work, on all levels! Free their hands!” Political scientist Sergey Mikheyev then chimed in with his own take on Bucha: “Maybe it’s a production, or maybe they brought the corpses from elsewhere. There is no shortage of dead bodies over there. There are no problems with [getting] corpses.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

4/5/2022,"Controversial Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) took to the House floor on Monday to educate troll his fellow representatives on the definition of a woman. However, his transparent ― and tasteless ― attempt to own those danged libs about gender didn’t seem to change any hearts and minds, based on the social media reaction to his definition. “I never imagined that one of my sacred duties in this hallowed chamber would be explaining to the House Speaker the difference between a man and a woman,” he said, referencing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). “Take notes, Madame Speaker, I’m about to define what a woman is for you.” Cawthorn then offered this definition: “XX chromosomes, no tallywacker.” “It’s so simple,” Cawthorn said. “And yet, today, this proclamation of fundamental scientific fact will cause the woke liberals in Silicon Valley to strip you of your voice and ban you until you bow at their altar of falsehoods.” Cawthorn’s comment seemed to be in response to an interaction that took place during Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Senate confirmation hearings, during which she was asked to define the word “woman” by Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.). Jackson declined to offer a definition and responded, “I’m not a biologist.” Although many conservatives made hay with the remark, USA Today noted that many scientists, gender law scholars and philosophers of biology say there is no sufficient way to clearly define what makes someone a woman. Gender has become a hot-button talking point on the right amid a wave of anti-transgender bills proposed in state legislatures around the country. Among them is Texas’ law that would classify gender-affirming care for transgender kids as child abuse and is currently facing legal challenges. Meanwhile, Twitter users weren’t impressed by Cawthorn’s comments. Cawthorn has been on somewhat of a roll recently, after angering his fellow Republicans by claiming various top “leaders” had invited him to orgies and had also used cocaine in front of him. He also came under fire for calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “thug” and for driving with a revoked license. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

4/5/2022,"The post Embalmed Body of Dead Rapper Propped Up at D.C. Nightclub appeared first on Consequence. The late Maryland rapper Goonew quite literally received the Weekend at Bernie’s treatment this past Sunday. Goonew, 24, was shot in a parking lot in Prince George’s County, Maryland on March 18th, and died several hours later at an area hospital. His family believes he was the victim of an armed robbery, and the Prince George’s County Police Department is offering a $25,000 for any information leading to the assailant’s arrest. On Sunday, Goonew’s family and friends held a celebratory event at Washington, D.C.’s Bliss Nightclub, which was billed as the rapper’s “final show.” As Complex points out, Goonew’s apparent embalmed corpse was propped upright and on full display during the event, adorned with a crown and designer clothing. A rapper named Black Fortune, who attended the event, confirmed that it was Goonew’s actual body and “no wax figure.” He added, “As long as his mother was happy that’s all that matter.” In a statement issued on Monday, Bliss Nightclub said it was “never made aware” that Goonew’s corpse would be on display during the event. “Bliss was contacted by a local funeral home to rent out our venue for Goonew’s home-going celebration,” the statement notes. “We sincerely apologize to all those who may be upset or offended. Please keep Goonew’s family and friends in your prayers at this difficult time. Respectfully, Bliss DC.” Embalmed Body of Dead Rapper Propped Up at D.C. Nightclub

4/5/2022,"A college student who was sexually harassed by three male classmates sent the evidence to their mothers — and is worried that she overreacted. “I’ve been getting bullied [and] harassed by three guys in my class who have taken to messaging me online with rather gross/harassing messages and NSFW pictures that I’m sure you can all fill in the gaps without me going into detail,” the 18-year-old college student wrote on Reddit’s “Am I The A**hole” forum. Although she reported their behavior (presumably to school officials), the students got off with a warning, then escalated the harassment. More from SheKnows I've Sent Five Kids to College -- Here Are the Most Important Things I Learned The OP (original poster) decided to screenshot the messages and send them to their moms, who she found on Facebook. “Their mothers were horrified and shocked by what I sent them explaining what was going on and all three are on my side,” wrote the teen. “Some of my friends think this is genius and exactly what they deserved but some of my other friends think I took it too far and it was out of line to put that on their mothers [because] I don’t know what their home life is like.” “Am I the a**hole for doing this? Should I have gone about it another way?” she wondered in her post. Click here to read the full article. Not according to Reddit’s standards. “The people saying you took it too far are the same ones who would defend those guys behavior as ‘just guys being guys,'” a commenter wrote. “What they were doing is organized sexual harassment, and it needs to be forwarded to school administration as well…” “…The fact is, even if they have family issues, it’s not your problem and not your obligation to just take it,” another said. “All it does is explain their behavior, not excuse it. People need to stop covering for perpetrators and harming the victim further by ‘what if’-ing their experiences.” Someone else concluded: “They had no expectation or right to privacy of the messages they sent you.” And several urged the OP to report the messages to the police. What the OP describes is “cyberstalking” which has occurred to one out of six women and one in 17 men, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which includes unwanted phone calls, emails, IMs, text messages as tactics. The U.S. Department of Justice also defines the term as “repeated and unwanted attention, harassment, contact, or any other course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear.” The term can be interchangeable” with cyber harassment which “usually pertains to threatening or harassing email messages, instant messages, or to blog entries or Web sites dedicated solely to tormenting an individual,” says the department. Per a 2017 poll by the Pew Research Center, 21 percent of women between the ages of 18 and 29 say they have been sexually harassed online and about 53 percent of women in the same age group “say that someone has sent them explicit images they did not ask for.” One Redditor suggested that the OP re-report the students to college administrators. “….Complain every time they send you something and tell them it’s interfering with your education,” they wrote. “Also, if they keep going because you complain, [that] is retaliation so make sure to specify that. If they don’t do anything tell them you’ll complain to the Department of Education.” This type of sexual harassment could violate Title IX, which “protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance.” As the National Women’s Law Center states, “This means that school districts may violate Title IX when sex-based harassment by classmates (or peers) is so serious that it creates a hostile environment for the victim and such harassment is encouraged, tolerated, not adequately addressed, or ignored by school employees.” Commenters wondered if sending the photos to parents created more victims (or skirted revenge porn laws). However, moms generally agreed with the OP: “….As a mother, I would be absolutely horrified if my son was doing this..but…parents aren’t 100% in control of how our kids turn out, and I bet the moms are glad they have the opportunity to put their boys on the right path.” Another wrote, “As the mother of a lad that will be going to [university], I want women to know they can report him … if he does this because his father and I will take it seriously.” “As a mother of two young men, I would welcome a young woman informing me of behavior like this and my son would ABSOLUTELY suffer consequences at home,” noted a mom. “I would be ashamed and appalled, and 100% on your side as well. I think you chose the best option.” These celeb parents have gotten very real about their kids growing up.

4/5/2022,"By Robin Emmott, Essi Lehto and Simon Johnson BARDUFOSS, Norway (Reuters) - The sound of gunfire echoed around the Norwegian fjords as a row of Swedish and Finnish soldiers, positioned prone behind banks of snow, trained rifles and missile launchers on nearby hills ready for an enemy attack. The drill, in March, was the first time forces from Finland and Sweden have formed a combined brigade in a scheduled NATO exercise in Arctic Norway known as ""Cold Response."" Neither country is a member of the NATO alliance. The exercise was long planned, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 added intensity to the war game. ""We would be rather naive not to recognise that there is a threat,"" Swedish Major Stefan Nordstrom told Reuters. ""The security situation in the whole of Europe has changed and we have to accept that, and we have to adapt."" That sense of threat means President Vladimir Putin, who embarked on what he calls a ""special operation"" in Ukraine partly to counter the expansion of the NATO alliance, may soon have a new NATO neighbour. Finland has a 1,300 km (810 mile) border with Russia. In a March 28 phone call, the country's President Sauli Niinisto asked NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg for details on principles and steps for accepting new members, he wrote on Facebook. Finland's leaders have discussed possible membership with ""almost all"" NATO's 30 members, and will submit a review to parliament by mid-April, Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto told Reuters. Sweden – home of the founder of the Nobel Peace Prize and a country which has not fought in a war since 1814 – is more hesitant. But a recent opinion poll for a major Swedish TV station found 59% of Swedes wanted to join NATO, if Finland does. For some in the alliance, the two countries sandwiched between Russia and NATO-member Norway are already partners. U.S. General David Berger, who is the commandant of the U.S. Marines Corps, told reporters at the drill that – putting the politics of membership aside – they were brothers-in-arms during training. ""For marines, at the tactical level ... there's no difference,"" Berger said. ""I just have to know that the unit over there, they have my back. They've got me covered."" Stoltenberg announced in early March that NATO was now sharing all information on the war in Ukraine with Sweden and Finland. Both countries regularly attend NATO meetings. At the exercises in Norway, Stoltenberg said ""no other countries in the world"" are closer partners. But he noted an important difference: ""The absolute security guarantees that we provide for NATO allies, are only for NATO allies."" As non-members, Finland and Sweden's combined population of 16 million don't have the protection of NATO's guarantee that an attack on one ally is an attack on all. Moscow did not respond to a request for comment for this story. It has repeatedly warned both countries against joining NATO. On March 12, the Russian foreign ministry said ""there will be serious military and political consequences"" if they do, according to Russian news agency Interfax. Stoltenberg has said it would be possible to allow Finland and Sweden in ""quite quickly."" NATO has not commented on what a fast-track process would be; a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Defense said any decision would be taken by the countries themselves but their accession would need to be agreed by all 30 allies. ""President Putin wants less NATO on Russia's borders,"" Stoltenberg said in January, also referring to more allied troops in southeastern Europe, Poland and the Baltics. ""But he is getting more NATO."" MEMORIES OF WAR More than 1,000 km to the southeast of the NATO drill, 80-year-old Markku Kuusela knows real war. The pensioner, who lives in Imatra, a town on Finland's border with Russia, was evacuated to Sweden with his brother as an infant after his father was killed fighting a Russian invasion. They returned to Finland only after the war was over. ""It is always in the back of my mind,"" said Kuusela, visiting the cemetery where his father is buried. Tears welled in his eyes. ""How it would have been to have a father."" Some 96,000 Finns, or 2.5% of the population, died fighting the Russian invasion, in two wars between 1939 and 1944. A total of 55,000 children lost fathers and over 400,000 people lost homes as territory was conceded. But the Finns, fighting under cover of dense forest, repelled the Russians and ever since, Finland has had a clear goal: strong defence and friendly relations with Russia. The country built a conscript army – it has about 900,000 men and women in reserves – and according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, one of the largest artilleries in Europe. For years, Finns and Russians have interacted extensively. This year, Imatra was planning to celebrate a 250-year history of Finnish tourism since a visit by Catherine the Great, the Russian empress, in 1772. Now the Imatra border station is deserted, its stalls unused. Finland's security service, known as Supo, says Russia's military resources are currently focused on Ukraine and its own domestic operations, but warns the situation may change quickly. The Ukraine invasion triggered almost 3,000 applications from Finns to join local associations of reservists as well as almost 1,000 to women's emergency preparedness groups, the groups said. One applicant was Pia Lumme, a 48-year-old coordinator for the Finnish National Agency for Education who lives near Imatra. She recalled her grandmother's war memories. ""I think we Finns all share ... the will to uphold this country,"" Lumme said. Finland is one of few European countries to maintain a national emergency supply of fuel, food and medicine. Building emergency shelters beneath every major building has been mandatory since World War Two. The country says its 54,000 shelters have room for 4.4 million of the 5.5 million population. Finns' backing for joining NATO has risen to record numbers over the past month, with the latest poll by public broadcaster Yle showing 62% of respondents in favour and only 16% against. Supo, the security service, said on March 29 Finland must guard against potential Russian retaliation to Helsinki's discussions on joining NATO, or interference in the public debate. ""We don't need to make any quick decisions on our own defence, but certainly a possible membership application could lead to making us a target of interference or hybrid actions,"" Haavisto told Reuters in an interview. ""Finland needs to prepare for that and also listen to how NATO countries would react."" CRISIS KITS Sweden, which has argued that non-alignment has served its people well, has been slower to see Russia as a threat – for example, it allowed defence spending to slip and emergency shelters to fall into disrepair after the Cold War. But the mood there is also changing. After Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the government speeded up rearmament and boosted military strength on the island of Gotland, near the headquarters of Russia's Baltic Fleet. It also reintroduced limited conscription that year. Stockholm said earlier this month it would almost double defence spending to around 2% of GDP and is refurbishing a network of emergency bunkers, to shelter up to seven million people. It says there are currently around 65,000 shelters, mostly in private homes. Around 71% of Swedes are worried about an increased military threat from Russia – up from 46% in January – according to a survey by pollsters Demoskop for daily Aftonbladet on March 2. Three retail chains told Reuters sales of products to prepare for emergencies had accelerated again after picking up at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Sales of crisis kits, wind-up radios, water filters and water containers - pretty much everything - have increased,"" said Fredrik Stockhaus, founder of Criseq, a Swedish online store. Sweden's statistics office does not measure sales at this level of detail. If either country does go for NATO membership, Finland looks set to move first, diplomats and politicians say. Foreign Minister Haavisto said he is in ""almost daily"" talks with his Swedish counterpart on the topic. ""It wouldn't be ideal for Finland to go alone, because then all the risks in the application process would be on Finland,"" said Matti Pesu, a foreign policy analyst at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. In Sweden, the government and opposition are conducting an analysis of security policy which is expected in May. Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson stressed on national TV on March 30 it was important to wait and see what conclusions that reaches. The ruling Social Democrats oppose joining, but four opposition parties support it. Even so, Sweden's non-aligned status is increasingly blurred, said Anna Wieslander, Northern Europe Director at the Atlantic Council think-tank. ""If you look at it, we are preparing to meet the adversary together and I think there is no doubt in which camp we are,"" she said. ""You can see the warnings Russia has given so there is no doubt on their side as well.""
