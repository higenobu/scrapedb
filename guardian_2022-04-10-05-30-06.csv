4/10/2022,"Such is the enduring lure of the Grand National that one in four adults in Britain placed a bet on this race, prospecting for gold in a minefield of a 40-runner handicap. Not many got lucky, judging by the muted reaction at Aintree as Noble Yeats bounded clear to win at 50-1. But this was a result to warm the soul, not swell the wallet. Earlier in the week Sam Waley-Cohen had announced this would be the final race of a career he has combined with running the £300m dentistry business he founded. Having won a Gold Cup on Long Run in 2011, few had expected him to top that riding a long shot 11 years later. But the 39-year-old summoned a ride of patience and poise to steer Noble Yeats gradually into the race before striking for home one fence from the finish to eclipse the 15-2 favourite, Any Second Now, by two lengths. To add another twist to this extraordinary story, Noble Yeats had only been bought for Waley-Cohen by his father, Robert, in February – and had come ninth out of 24 runners in his last race at Cheltenham. And yet, on a boisterous Aintree day, a quiet miracle happened. As a script it would surely have been rejected by Hollywood for being too outlandish. Yet after this victory it didn’t seem entirely reasonable for Waley-Cohen to suggest that his “doppelganger” Dominic West could play him in a star-studded film of this triumph. It has become an iron law of the Grand National that horses seven and under don’t win. The last to do so was Bogskar in 1940, when war was on the mind, Aintree was packed with servicemen and sailors, and the headline in the Manchester Guardian hailed a “Winner Who Came Up Unnoticed”. More than 80 years later, that headline could happily be put back into service. Yet everything about Waley-Cohen’s story has had a touch of stardust on it. Until now, he has perhaps been best known for getting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to rekindle their romance after their split in 2007 – tellingly, the pair tweeted their congratulations after the race. But winning the greatest steeplechase of all, four-and-a-quarter miles of peril and drama over 30 jumps, surely will top that. “It’s a dream. I couldn’t believe it,” he admitted, before praising his dad and thanking his wife. “That is beyond words. It’s a fairytale, it’s a fantasy. Just full of love, happiness and gratefulness.” Waley-Cohen also paid tribute to his brother Thomas, who died in 2004. “When you lose somebody you love, you realise you should make the most of life,” he said. “And also to try and put a lot of energy into every day – as you don’t know if it will be your last.” This was the first National in front of fans since 2019, and from the stands and the bars 70,000 people watched on with pleasure and expectation, determined to make up for lost time. All afternoon Aintree hummed with a buzz that comes gratis at a major sporting event. People cheered. People smiled. And most of all people drank, although at £5.80 for a can of Carling and £8 for a small wine, there was a price to pay on the bank balance as well as the liver. But while the course was bathed in sunshine when the National began at 5.18pm, looks were deceptive. The temperatures remained defiantly stuck in single figures, while the wind was sharp and spiteful. Few of the 70,000 crowd, though, were deterred. This was a day when silk dresses outnumbered racing anoraks; of multiple stag and hen dos; an affirmation of fun and freer times after two years of a global pandemic. The stories were not all positive, mind. Earlier in the day, Elle Est Belle, a six-year-old mare, died of a suspected heart attack after finishing fourth in the novices hurdle and Discorama was later revealed to have been put down after the Grand National. Meanwhile as Aintree began to clean up, the bookmaker Neville Porter was revelling in his best Grand National day for over a decade. His afternoon began splendidly as three short-priced favourites, Edwardstone, Flooring Porter and Shan Blue, were all beaten. But the National was to provide even greater riches. Before the race he had told the Observer: “We’re looking for a 50-1 or bigger winner, as most people won’t back them, to hit the jackpot. But they don’t come around very often.” Afterwards he couldn’t stop smiling. “We hit the jackpot and then some. It’s been a very good day.” Waley-Cohen was also beaming as he confirmed that he would hang up his saddle for a life of Zoom and Microsoft Teams meetings running Portman Dental care. “It keeps me out of trouble,” he said. “Life will continue as before. “I’ve said for ages that if I won the Grand National I would retire there and then. When you have a ride that goes as well as that it is wise to stick to that.” And who could blame him after this, the perfect ending?",Sport/Sport,Sam Waley-Cohen signs off at the top after ride of a lifetime on Noble Yeats,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/09/sam-waley-cohen-signs-off-at-the-top-after-ride-of-a-lifetime-on-noble-yeats
4/10/2022,"Henry Patterson, the bestselling novelist who wrote the The Eagle Has Landed, has died aged 92. The writer died at his home in Jersey surrounded by his family, his publisher HarperCollins said. Patterson wrote 85 novels, predominantly thrillers and in the espionage genre, using the pseudonym Jack Higgins. He is most synonymous with writing The Eagle Has Landed, set during the second world war, which was published in 1975. It sold more than 50m copies and was adapted into a British film of the same name which starred Sir Michael Caine, Donald Sutherland, Jenny Agutter and Robert Duvall. Patterson sold more than 250m copies worldwide and his books were translated into 60 languages. HarperCollins chief executive Charlie Redmayne said: “I’ve been a fan of Jack Higgins for longer than I can remember. “He was a classic thriller writer: instinctive, tough, relentless. “The Eagle Has Landed and his other Liam Devlin books, his later Sean Dillion series, and so many others were and remain absolutely unputdownable. “Being part of his publishing for even part of his career has been a privilege – his passing marks the end of an era.” Patterson was born on 27 July 1929 in Newcastle upon Tyne to an English father and a Northern Irish mother. He was raised in Belfast until his mother remarried and he moved to Leeds. After a two-year stint of national service, he qualified as a teacher and began to write novels in his spare time. The writer received a £75 advance for his first novel, Sad Wind From The Sea, in 1959. Jonathan Lloyd, Patterson’s literary agent and president of Curtis Brown, said he was at Collins Publishers when it received the manuscript of The Eagle Has Landed, and everyone there knew it would become a classic. He said: “40 years later, Curtis Brown became his agent … and it was thrilling to work again with Harry, and I look forward now to working with his wife, Denise, and daughter, Hannah, and the family on preserving and promoting his extraordinary legacy.” Patterson’s final book, The Midnight Bell, was published in 2017 and was a Sunday Times bestseller. The novelist is survived by his four children from his first marriage – Sarah, Ruth, Sean and Hannah – and by his wife, Denise.",News/UK news,"Henry Patterson, author of The Eagle Has Landed, dies aged 92",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/09/henry-patterson-author-of-the-eagle-has-landed-dies-aged-92
4/10/2022,"The pandemic is still happening, but it is no longer front page news. It has been pushed off by devastating floods, the war in Ukraine, increasingly dire warnings about a global climate breakdown, one celebrity hitting another celebrity, and the pending federal election. And yet, all around us, people are testing positive to Covid-19. The graph of Australia’s case numbers shows a sharp spike over early January, when the first Omicron wave saw more than 100,000 new cases reported each day, and it is starting to rise again. In the past week alone, 518 people with Covid died in Australia. More than 80,000 people returned or registered a positive test, but the real number of positive cases is much higher. Rapid antigen tests miss at least 30% of cases, and PCR tests can also return a false negative for a person with a low viral load. Health and aged care workers, who have been in crisis mode since the pandemic was declared 759 days ago, are exhausted. Teachers are exhausted. Even those who have been sheltered from the worst effects of the pandemic are exhausted, or are loudly arguing that there is nothing to complain about. That is a different source of exhaustion – the fear that acknowledging the pandemic is not yet over could trigger the return of restrictions. “I have joked that we need a whole year off,” says Prof Karen Pierce, the president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. “A year just to have fun and joy. On top of all the terrible things happening overseas, it’s like there’s no joy anywhere. It’s awful.” General practitioners have been on the frontline of the pandemic response, and are now on the frontline of the cleanup. There are two years’ worth of missed check ups, delayed tests and mental health concerns. Getting on top of all those missed appointments, and preparing for the winter Covidvaccine booster rollout and what experts have warned could be the worst flu season in three years, is taking its toll. “The mental health burden is significant,” Pierce says. “The whole community has experienced some form of dislocation and grief and the last two years weighs heavily on many people.” Pierce is particularly concerned about the mental health of young adults whose university experience has been interrupted and social networks fragmented by two years of online classes. In Melbourne, where Pierce is based, those social networks have been slow to recover. “People are still just sitting on devices – it’s like they’ve developed an alternative world to mingle in, but it’s not a very happy world,” she says. There is a disconnect between the public health messaging, where the pandemic remains front of mind, and the broader public consciousness, which has shoved the pandemic to one side. “The world has habituated to a pretty terrible situation where ordinarily something like that was on the front page two years ago. Now it is barely mentioned,” Pierce says. Schools, already a significant source of coronavirus transmission, have reported an increase in cases at the start of autumn. In South Australia this week there were 508 teachers and 351 support staff isolating because of Covid, affecting 346 schools, and 4.2% of students were absent due to Covid-related reasons. In Western Australia, 1,038 schools have reported positive cases since the start of term one – and the state still requires classroom contacts and their families to isolate, although children can attend school while a close contact. The Victorian education department recorded 3,669 positive cases in students and 375 in teachers in government schools on Monday and Tuesday alone. The absence rate for students in Victorian government schools in term one has averaged 11%. The absence rate for teachers has also been high and there are not enough casual teachers to fill demand, the Victorian branch president of the Australian Education Union, Meredith Peace, says. “I met with a large group of principals yesterday and they’re very much exhausted by it all,” she says. “They’re continuing to do what they can to make sure their schools are alright, filling gaps where they can. But it is a real struggle.” The increase in cases at the end of term one has teachers concerned that cases will continue to rise in terms two and three. “We are concerned given what we’ve seen towards the end of this term with increased numbers of absences,” Pearce says. “If it continues the way it has been we are seriously concerned about the sustainability of that for our members.” ​​ Despite the rise in case numbers, life has, in many areas, started to return to normal. Workplace attendance in Australia has returned to the level seen in December 2021, just before Omicron hit, according to Google mobility data. Public transport use has also climbed to levels not seen since before the Delta wave hit in June 2021. Both remain below the baseline levels from January 2020, but it is a steady recovery after successive lockdowns. The experience of people working in hospitals at the moment is “horrific”, says Brett Holmes, the general secretary of the New South Wales Nurses and Midwives’ Association. The seven-day rolling average for hospital admissions in NSW is 150, a slight increase on last week, but hospitalisation numbers remain below those seen in the peak of the Omicron wave in January. The outcomes for people in hospital have also been improved due to access to better drug therapies. But the strain on the system remains. “They are all people that were never in the health system before, so it’s over and above the normal demand,” Holmes says. “And we’ve had spikes in the number of health staff who have been furloughed, because they are infected, or more likely because they are caring for their kid because it has really gone through the schools.” Holmes says the exhaustion level in hospitals is “enormous”. Five hundred more nurses and midwives left the profession last year than would in an ordinary year. He understands why those who don’t work in the medical system, or are fortunate to not be in a high risk category, want to think about something – anything – else. But he says he’s “very worried” about going into winter with a health system already under strain. “Everyone needs to get on with their life, and at some point we will all have been exposed and it will be like the flu,” Holmes says. “But the flu kills people, thousands of people, and we’ve got used to that. Where we’re heading to is a situation where you will have flu plus Covid, and it will kill people who are vulnerable.”",News/Australia news,"How are Australians feeling after more than two years of Covid?

4/10/2022,"The former Liberal candidate Michael Towke isn’t the only Lebanese-Australian re-living the Cronulla Riots and the years of racial tensions that followed. As I speak to people in my community and watch the commentary on social media, one defence of the prime minister, Scott Morrison, from a well-known Lebanese community member really bothered me. “He always stood by us, he’s always checked in on us, and has always been by our side,” Danny Abdallah said in a video message posted on Instagram. Abdallah tragically lost three of his children after they were hit and killed by a drunk driver in Sydney’s west in 2020. “Morrison has not one racist bone in his body, what he has done for me and Leila and my family,” Abdallah continued. I am glad the Abdallah family felt supported by the prime minister, given the enormity of their pain and loss. I really am. However, racism is far less about individual acts of kindness toward a grieving family (or, on the flip side, calling an Arab a “terrorist”) and far more about social systems and power structures that ensure non-white people don’t get a fair go. The Abdallahs had trauma and loss – not political power or economic influence. Towke was a young politician with a promising career that he alleges was taken from him, accusing Morrison of using his racial background against him. “I would have been the first Australian of Lebanese heritage to be a federal member of parliament on the Liberal party side and that’s a bit of history there which they stole from me,” he told The Project. Morrison has categorically denied what he describes as “malicious” claims. But it doesn’t matter whether you’re “team Abdallah” or “team Towke” when it comes to the truth about the prime minister. It’s almost inconsequential. Australia’s racism is bigger than one man – even if he is the leader of the country. Despite our self-congratulatory rhetoric about being a thriving multicultural nation, in many ways Australia is more of an “ethnocracy” than a democracy. This is because our government, media and courts are dominated and run by white people, despite the fact an estimated 24% of Australians are Indigenous or non-European (not Anglo, European or white). The term “ethnocracy” was coined by the Israeli geographer Oren Yiftachel to explain regimes which claim to be democratic, but are clearly ruled by a particular ethnic group. It was first used to describe the substantial power imbalance between Jews and Palestinians as well as the ethnically based laws in the Israel-occupied West Bank. In an ethnocracy, a single ethnic or religious grouping dominates and uses this power to maintain the control and oppression of others. Those who don’t fit the mould are excluded. Since Federation in 1901, Australia was designed to ensure people of British descent would be able to create a society populated by individuals as much like themselves as possible. Back then, policies and laws were explicitly racist, like assimilation for Indigenous people and the White Australia Policy. Today, the language has changed yet many of the same pillars of power are still intact. Morrison’s 24-person cabinet is not only male dominated, it’s blindingly white. There is only one Indigenous member, but no non-Europeans despite our sizeable Mandarin, Hindi and Arabic-speaking populations. New Zealand’s Labour party has 16 Māori MPs, an expanded group with Pacific Islands heritage, and the first MP of African origin. It’s the country’s most diverse parliament in terms of minority ethnic and Indigenous representation and gender. Canada’s government maintained gender parity in its 2021 cabinet and is also culturally diverse, with people of colour accounting for 21%. Australia’s Labor party is doing better than the Coalition, but only marginally. While Anthony Albanese’s cabinet has near gender parity, in addition to one Indigenous cabinet member, there are only two people who hail from non-European backgrounds. And let’s not forget that twice in one year, Labor has decided to parachute white candidates into some of the most multicultural seats in the country and elbow local, diverse candidates out of the way. Responding to criticism of the decision in Fowler to bring in senator Kristina Keneally over Tu Le, a local lawyer with a Vietnamese background in an area where one in five voters speak Vietnamese, Albanese praised the American-born Keneally as a migrant “success story”. If a country only sees “success” in shades of white, and embraces multiculturalism when it’s a nice photo opportunity at a food festival, then are we really functioning as a democracy that allows all Australians to fully participate? It’s tempting to reduce the Towke-Morrison affair to just historical factional infighting that is no longer relevant. However it is relevant, not just to this election but for Australia more broadly. Those who continue to have decision-making power in our courts, government and media look and sound like the Morrisons of Australia, not the Towkes and Abdallahs.

4/10/2022,"Walking in the park the other day, I overheard a conversation between two women. “I’m running out of time, but I’m also not gonna be like, ‘I’m having a baby for the sake of having a baby,’” said the younger of the two. “One thing I would recommend,” replied the older woman, “if it’s an option: freeze your eggs.” As a woman, you get to a certain age and babies – hypothetical, expected, realised – suddenly seem ubiquitous: in friendship circles, on social media, in targeted advertising for pregnancy tests and public health messages. But for women of my generation, the decision whether to have children feels more existentially fraught and morally complex than ever before. I have always wanted kids. I have always felt an uncomplicated joy at the chubbiness of babies’ limbs and the infectiousness of a child’s laughter. I never used to feel the need to rationalise this desire, but I have grown increasingly ambivalent about the prospect of raising children in an era of climate collapse. And I am not alone: a 2019 survey found that one in three Australian women under 30 said they were reconsidering having children because of a worry about “an unsafe future from climate change”. In 2021, a survey of nearly 23,000 millennials and Gen Z-ers in 45 countries found that more than 40% of respondents believed the world has “already hit the point of no return when it comes to the environment and that it’s too late to repair the damage”. As a science journalist, I have reported extensively on the climate crisis. Future predictions are more dire than present reality, which is already dire enough; recent weeks have brought unprecedented rain and floods in the eastern states, record-breaking heat in Western Australia, the driest summer in Tasmania in 40 years, a sixth mass bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, unusually high temperatures at the poles, and the collapse of the Conger ice shelf in East Antarctica. Given this state of affairs, there is a flurry of new books that each grapple with having and raising children now. The climate crisis and the question of what “we owe to the planet when it comes to adding another human to it” is one of the key considerations in Gina Rushton’s new book, The Most Important Job in the World. Rushton, an Australian journalist who decided years earlier that she did not want children, is prompted by a medical emergency to interrogate her choice with journalistic rigour. She spends precisely nine months interviewing, reading and reflecting on the exigencies and implications of motherhood: on reproductive rights and justice, on its physical and emotional costs, on whether it is possible to “let ourselves imagine any future without being overpowered by despair or manipulated by hope”. The Most Important Job in the World examines both personal and collective responsibility. “We know that more than a third of all greenhouse gas emissions since 1965 can be traced to just 20 fossil fuel companies,” Rushton writes. “The idea that we should abridge our desires for the size of our families and communities before transforming our energy systems is peculiar, and yet I know if I was to have a child, I would be scrambling to shrink its footprint before its feet even hit the ground.” The 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season – which killed or displaced nearly 3 billion animals, and temporarily depleted the ozone layer – “will be average by 2040 and cool by 2060”, the climate scientist Dr Joëlle Gergis tells Rushton. A regional GP to whom she speaks recalls babies born during bushfires coming prematurely. “The placenta is normally pink and healthy and comes away easily during birth but these were grey and grainy, as they are in pack-a-day smokers, requiring an operation to remove them,” Rushton writes. In a pessimistic mood, it is not difficult to imagine that those babies’ future lives might resemble that of the son in Cormac McCarthy’s 2006 novel The Road, born in a world ravaged by firestorms and shrouded in ash. Will my generation have to describe to our children the delight of spotting a koala balled up high in the gum trees, and explain that we let them go extinct through inaction? Or what the crackling of a healthy coral reef sounded like, because we let the waters warm too much? It is unsurprising that people of reproductive age in Australia are having fewer children than ever before: fertility rates hit a record low of 1.58 births per woman in 2020. And yet. There is an uncomfortable cognitive dissonance in wanting to bring children into an increasingly uninhabitable world, but often it is not enough to nullify the wanting. This was the case for Sian Prior, a writer and broadcaster who worked for the Australian Conservation Foundation in the 1980s. Her new memoir, Childless: A Story of Freedom and Longing, conveys the sense of “failure and disappointment” familiar to women who want to have their own biological children but are unable to. She describes the sensation of “solastalgia” – the existential distress of environmental collapse, or “how you feel when something in the natural world is being destroyed before your very eyes”. “Why create people you love and condemn them to an uncertain future on an overheating planet?” one of Prior’s campaigning friends asks her. “It was hard to argue against this logic,” she concedes, but she wanted children dearly anyway: Prior’s memoir details three miscarriages and subsequent unsuccessful fertility treatments. For Prior, being stereotyped as a “selfish career woman” (recall Julia Gillard being accused of being “deliberately barren”) or “helpless victim of peer pressure” rankles. She overhears a new acquaintance on a group holiday talking about her: “‘Childless women,’ the woman says, ‘are usually so selfish.’” I would have liked to see a more robust dismantling of tropes about childless women as objects of pity, suspicion, or scorn. The US writer Ann Patchett, who knew from a young age that parenthood was not for her, is matter-of-fact in an essay in her recent collection, These Precious Days. At age 30, she was told by a successful male writer that “until you have children, you don’t know what it means to love”. She writes: “People want you to want what they want … Does my choice not to have children mean I judge your choices, your children? That I think my life is in some way superior? It does not.” The pathos of Prior’s heartbreak thrums through her memoir. “At the supermarket,” she writes, “I search out my usual deodorant (baby-powder scented) and some sunscreen (for kids) and a pink moisturiser (especially for baby), products that make me feel safer.” The book’s title is telling: where the term “child-free” is used by people who have voluntarily decided not to have kids, “childless” emphasises Prior’s lack. While she eventually finds a bittersweet freedom without children, Prior is ultimately an ambivalent non-parent. Out next week is Mothertongues, “an experimental book of bio-autofiction about motherhood” co-authored by Australian-based writers Ceridwen Dovey and Eliza Bell. It is formally eclectic, bringing together an assemblage of recollections, notes, messages, songs and poems. The vignettes – which both recall and explicitly mention Jenny Offill’s Dept. of Speculation – parallel the life of a mother to young children, which is “made of non sequiturs, fragments, interruptions, stories that go nowhere”. Environmental worries feature, minorly: “They found a plastic bag at the bottom of the Mariana Trench’’; “how about we talk about … what it feels like to have a child when the apocalypse is on the horizon?” Climate anxiety is one consideration in deciding to have a child; another is the time-intensive work of parenting, particularly of young kids. In Mothertongues, conversations play out between two mothers, between virtual assistants (Alexa, Siri, Cortana) reimagined as embodied people, and in absurdist theatrical scenes. They discuss “the transition from having a body that belongs to you … to having a body that belongs to others”, what Simone de Beauvoir described as “the Sisphyean torture” of housework, and the difficulty of juggling parental responsibilities with paid and creative work. “Virginia Woolf may have wanted to become a mother early in her life but later, years into her marriage, she embraced being child-free … She knew exactly what motherhood would have stolen from her,” Dovey and Bell write. Their characters accept their lot, which is the frustrating reality for many Australian women: they will shoulder the majority of the burden of domestic labour, leaving them “too tired to ask questions about the wider structures that dictate how their lives are lived”. When questions are asked, they are rhetorical: “What would it feel like to live in a society where … our heroine, is raised up and celebrated not through vacuous statements about the importance of producing children for the survival of the human race but through actual financial, logistical, emotional, day-to-day support?” “Stubborn statistics,” Rushton writes, “show women continue to arrive home from full-time work to perform a second shift of unpaid labour – globally, women and girls still perform $10.8 trillion worth of unpaid labour every year.” The 2021 Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia report found that women in heterosexual couples, with dependent children, do 21 hours more unpaid work a week than men. A more equal division of labour in queer families offers alternatives to roles dictated by heteronormative strictures, as Natalie Kon-yu points out in her edifying and galvanising book, The Cost of Labour, which was published in February. Partly a memoir about her own traumatic first pregnancy, the book seeks to “get people to think more carefully about the systems we enter into when we decide to have families”. Kon-yu examines the ideological and historical contexts for policies that affect pregnancy, reproductive autonomy, and the labour of parenting in Australia. “There has been a huge ideological shift that has occurred in the postwar decades,” she writes. “Prior to the 1960s, there was a cultural assumption that the primary definition of a woman (whether she wanted to get married or not, whether she was queer or not, cisgendered or not) was as a wife and mother.” Women today have far greater freedom to define themselves beyond the biological imperative, yet mothers incur both financial and workplace challenges – and “fathers who ask for more flexible work time, or who deviate from the male breadwinner role, face punishment in the workplace”. Given all this – the accelerating climate crisis, the structural inequities, the difficulty of juggling career and parenting – why bring a child into the world? In Notes from an Apocalypse, Mark O’Connell questions “whether having children is a statement of hope, an insistence on the beauty and meaningfulness and basic worth of being here, or an act of human sacrifice … You want to believe that it is you who have done your children a favour by ‘giving’ them life, but the reverse is at least as true, and probably more so.” But while having fewer children may be the greatest impact an individual can have in reducing their carbon emissions, we should also be wary of the way in which big polluters have seized upon personal guilt to distract from their own outsize culpability. And it is a privilege to be able to deliberate on the decision to have children, when reproductive justice is denied to so many women. It is worth noting the insidious link between reproductive control, and racist and classist notions of who should be encouraged or allowed to reproduce. “You can pick almost any family planning organisation older than a few decades to understand eugenic influence on the birth control movement,” Rushton writes. Having children, by and large, is still viewed as a moral imperative. Books on the choice to become a parent often don’t treat it as a choice at all, but the default state to be pined after, lamented or improved. Less often are the freedoms and ramifications of not doing so considered. But with or without children, eking out a meaningful life feels necessarily grounded in a collective endeavour to improve humanity’s future. For Rushton, “imagining the end of procreation should not be easier than imagining a world in which we can transform the forces that make creating new life so fraught”. The decision need not be an unresolvable burden, “but an opportunity to ask not just what we want from our own lives but what kind of world we want to move towards whether we parent or not.” The Most Important Job in the World by Gina Rushton ($34.99, Macmillan Australia), Childless: A Story of Freedom and Longing by Sian Prior ($34.99, Text Publishing) and The Cost of Labour by Natalie Kon-yu ($32.99, Affirm Press) are out now in Australia.

4/10/2022,"It was the re-election of a Coalition government in May 2019 that altered the trajectory of Sam Noonan’s life and politics. “I didn’t really care about politics until then,” Noonan says. “But then a lightbulb went off, and I kind of went, ‘Well, this is not working, we need to do something.’” At first the 48-year-old helped organise climate rallies in her region, but it was Extinction Rebellion – the group which caused widespread disruption in London in November 2018 – that captured her attention. The group members’ willingness to face a strong possibility of being arrested appealed to her, as they appeared to take the catastrophic risk of climate change seriously. “[I felt] these, you know, radical, annoying, disruptive, interfering sort of tactics were probably our last chance of doing something,” Noonan says. “I just knew, intuitively, that this is where I needed to be. “I always said to my husband once we started all this activism that even if all else fails and we can’t save the planet, I want to know that I tried and be able to say to my grandkids, I really did my best, I did my best at the time.” A few months after Noonan joined Extinction Rebellion, the Black Summer bushfires swept through New South Wales, Victoria and parts of South Australia, changing her life again. Noonan, who is blind, had confront the possibility of fleeing her home in the Illawarra, south of Sydney. “Fires were coming from three directions at once,” Noonan says. “I was there wondering if I could evacuate out of Dapto because I didn’t have anyone who could drive the car and a lot of the train lines were down.” After the catastrophic event that left 18,000 Australians internally displaced, Noonan joined a new protest group calling themselves Fireproof Australia. In recent weeks the group has been grabbing headlines for blocking major roads during the morning peak hour to call for immediate action on climate change, including obstructing traffic on the Sydney Harbour Bridge at least three times. The NSW government rushed through strict laws to curb the protests, and the premier, Dominic Perrottet, attacked Fireproof Australia for their disruptive tactics. “This type of behaviour needs to stop,” Perrottet said. “People have the right to protest, people have the right to free speech, we promote that. “But don’t do it at the expense of people trying to get to and from work, trying to get their kids to school, stopping people earning a living and a wage – that’s what these protests are doing. “We’ve passed the laws, we’ll throw the book at these people, because their behaviour is completely unacceptable. “And if you really want to lose support in the community for your cause, keep acting like that.” This week the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its latest comprehensive review, saying it was “now or never” to prevent catastrophic climate change. Protest groups around the world have been growing more ambitious in response to what they see as an emergency. Among those that have emerged in the UK are Tyre Extinguishers, which encourages people to deflate the tyres of SUV owners, and Just Stop Oil, which targets oil infrastructure. Groups such as Fireproof Australia, Floodproof Australia and Blockade Australia are local variations who employ direct action in a campaign of “civil resistance” against governments which they believe aren’t acting fast enough on climate change. Violet CoCo, a Fireproof Australia member, says the group splintered from Extinction Rebellion in May 2021 to take the protests to a new level. “Fireproof Australia is designed to be more disruptive and more accessible in that disruption,” CoCo says. “All you need to do is sit down on a road to participate, you don’t need to wear a fancy costume.” They also have different demands. Extinction Rebellion wants governments to declare a climate emergency and rapidly cut emissions to zero by 2025 while Fireproof Australia’s goals are more immediate. CoCo says the group wants a permanent, Australian-based air tanker fleet to fight bushfires, smoke-proof schools, aged care and disability centres to protect the vulnerable, and an immediate plan to rehome flood and fire survivors. Some commentators who support urgent action on the climate crisis have criticised direct action tactics as counterproductive, warning they may alienate the very people who need to be persuaded. Writing in the Nine newspapers last month, the social researcher Rebecca Huntley said people who were “disengaged, uncertain or sceptical” were less likely to listen to someone who was making it harder for them to get to work. “In the qualitative research I have done, groups such as Extinction Rebellion come up in conversation in a very negative way and can be a barrier to talking about global warming and how climate action might actually improve their lives,” Huntley wrote. But CoCo says every other attempt to get governments to act has failed. “We tried,” CoCo says. “We tried protesting to the politicians. We’ve tried one-day marches. Nothing happened. And so now we need to escalate these disruptive tactics.” The group is often associated with Blockade Australia, whose members obstruct physical infrastructure such as rail lines or cranes, although the two groups are separate. Blockade Australia’s membership is drawn from several campaigns, including Rising Tide, which targeted the coal industry in Newcastle, and anti-Adani protesters from Queensland. The group’s first major action was obstructing coal trains at Newcastle, the largest coal port in the world in November 2021, prompting an attack from Barnaby Joyce, who said $60m in exports had been lost in one week. In recent weeks the group has targeted Port Botany in Sydney, Australia’s largest container port, which led to the arrest of Maxim Curmi, who was jailed for four months after he scaled a 60m crane. Unlike other groups, Blockade Australia has no specific goals. Maddie, a spokesperson who declined to give her surname citing the risk of arrest, says it is focused on “building momentum” as it “doesn’t see any worth in appealing to the goodwill of a system that doesn’t have any”. The hurried NSW legislation in response to the street and industry blockades has been branded a “draconian” attempt to criminalise the right to protest by 40 civil society groups, including the NSW and Act Aboriginal Legal Service, the NSW Council for Civil Liberties, Human Rights Law Centre, Environmental Defenders Office and Australian Democracy Network. Piero Moraro, a lecturer in criminology at Edith Cowan University who studies civil disobedience, says the right to protest can simply be restrained to “waving flags under the eyes of the police”. As much as governments and commentators may cast militant or disruptive protest groups as troublemakers and even criminals, Moraro says they can drive change thanks to the “radical flank effect”. “It is a reference to Martin Luther King,” Moraro says. “One reason why he was successful is that you also had the Black Panthers. White America was faced with the choice to either go with King or face more radical protests.” Associate prof Hans Baer, an honorary research fellow at the University of Melbourne, says there is a risk disruptive protests will “put off mainstream Australia”, but they are also necessary. “It’s the more radical people who get the attention that pushes the more middle of the road people to act,” Baer says. “There may be a method to their madness. So long as it doesn’t hurt people, if it only hurts infrastructure that is doing damage and that in turn hurts a lot of people, well, why not?”",News/Environment,Fireproof Australia: who are the radical Extinction Rebellion splinter group?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/10/fireproof-australia-who-are-the-radical-extinction-rebellion-splinter-group
4/10/2022,"It’s been more than a year since I divorced alcohol – which began as an attempt to wrest some control over a life thrown into a tumble dryer by the rude intrusions of a pandemic. Questions fielded from fellow 30-somethings since then have hinted more at curiosity than taboo. “Why did you suddenly choose to give up alcohol?” The answer: the ranking of health in the pecking order of life priorities rises as the creases of age begin to appear. Those health benefits were predictably felt. My higher-than-desired cholesterol dropped 0.8 mmol/L in the year sans booze. “If you keep up with this trend, you’ll be on track to reaching your target,” my doctor encouraged. I made the decision to stop drinking only months after being Covid-catapulted across the planet, along with many Australian emigrants. I left behind communities and friendships I’d established in the pre-Covid decade spent abroad, first in Beirut then in Washington. I had not lived in the city of my upbringing, Melbourne, since said upbringing. Childhood friendships and extended family were all that remained, but as I discovered – as years had passed and trajectories drifted – those friendships had been made for their moment. “A lot of people have this misconception that friends from high school are actually going to be friends forever,” Michelle Lim, clinical psychologist and loneliness researcher at Swinburne University, tells me. “Your needs change as you grow, which means your friendship circles will change as you grow.” That presented me with a confounding context. I was surrounded by the familiar, but felt entirely foreign. I needed to build a new relationship with my city of birth. But as I faced the prospect of making new friends more suited to who I am now, I realised socialising would prove to be the biggest challenge of decoupling from alcohol. Bad as it was for my cholesterol, drinking was integral to my social life throughout adulthood. It was a weapon that broke down barriers and allowed for human bonding. In places where shared languages – or values – were absent, alcohol became the common tongue. I’d factored none of this into my decision to cut it out. Myriad paths exist to making friends while sober. At least 17,000, if the responses to one Reddit thread asking the very question are any indication. But the overwhelming majority of advice boils down to two suggestions: join a local community group or take up a group activity. The problem with these well-meaning tips is that too often “meeting” people is conflated with befriending them, and they are not one and the same. Building intimate friendships – those that truly serve as a barricade against loneliness – requires more profound elements: trust and affinity. Friendship exists on a spectrum, and certain cultures reflect this with language. Arabic, for example, contains no single word for “friend”, but rather has a variety of words to describe the importance of the relationship. Nadeem could be applied to an acquaintance you might frequent bars with because they’re the only one available, khalil means a friend dear to the heart, which is again distinguished from safi – a confidante and best friend with admirable values. “If you think about our deepest friendships, they don’t come out of the blue,” Lim says. “They have been built quite organically over the years.” If we strive for quality in our friendships – the khalils and safis – then a fitness studio or book club only serves as an entry point. The hard work is in cultivating a new acquaintance, even one with overlapping interests, into a trustworthy friend. It’s in this process that I’d previously found alcohol to be an invaluable ally. On one particular “drinks night” sober, I noticed I could only keep up with conversation until those around me began to sink deeper into intoxication. It’s incredible how alcohol distorts what might be considered amusing. A 2015 study from social policy and addiction researcher Dr Sarah MacLean, which interviewed 60 young drinkers in Melbourne, found that “alcohol’s disinhibitory effect” allowed for a deepening of trust and greater intimacy in the friendship. “Study participants noted that being drunk provided a warrant to talk about things that otherwise could not be said, and to move their bodies in a way that would not be possible if they were sober,” MacLean wrote. Upon reflection, all of my close friendships over the years have been forged through a similar process. Alcohol casts a liberating spell, unmasking constrained aspects of our characters, which acts as an accelerant in deepening a friendship. “Alcohol is a kind of cheaty, fast way to get comfortable with somebody,” says Roger Patulny, associate professor of sociology at the University of Wollongong. There’s a reason it is known as “liquid courage”. “Often people use alcohol to relieve anxiety, specifically social anxiety, because they don’t know how to strike a conversation,” Lim says. Social interaction is a skill, Lim adds, and one that we never truly practise if we constantly turn to alcohol to amplify our interactions. It was clear, in my case, that there would be no immediate switch. Social skills would take time to develop, like learning to balance a bike without training wheels. All these years, alcohol had been a social stabiliser and now I needed to ride without. And yet, we live in a society where for many, the training wheels never come off. Alcohol is both the default for enabling unfettered social interaction and celebrated for it. Like most western cultures, Australian society largely follows an “individualistic model”, Patulny says. Individualism, according to a 2010 cross-cultural study of social anxiety, heightens our “embarrassability” and “fear of negative evaluations” because we draw our self-esteem from distinguishing ourselves from those around us, thus emphasising how we are perceived in a group setting. “Anxiety is very much characterised by a fear of negative evaluation – ‘I might say the wrong thing; I might embarrass myself’,” Lim says. Such social anxieties, prevalent in more individualistic societies like Australia’s, eventually lead to greater alcohol consumption, US researchers found in a 2008 study. So, turning the alcohol tap off was not simply about finding new friends in alcohol-free zones, but unpacking my approaches to friendship and confronting the social anxieties that necessitated drinking in the first place. Ironically, Melbourne’s many lockdowns provided the two tools to practise my sober social skills and re-examine my approach to friendship: proximity and frequency. With movement restrictions imposed for lengthy periods, I had little choice but to engage the local community if human interaction was to be had. And that, according to Lim, has always been an obvious avenue to developing meaningful friendships. “Do we know our neighbours? Do we know our community? Do we have friends that live near us already where we can improve the relationship?” Lim queries. Sometimes the obvious friendships are those closest to you, literally. Proximity allows for a greater frequency of interaction and a more regular social scene – a rival accelerant to alcohol. When you see people all the time, you start to get comfortable and the inhibitions fall away organically. It’s why, Lim says, we often think our closest friendships were formed in high school, because “you see the same people time and time again for a very long period”. In the nearly two decades of my family living at their property, I hardly knew any of our neighbours. But by the time 2021 had ended, barbecues, dinners and games nights among the neighbourhood had become almost routine. Trust, I found, was built through frequent gestures of support and generosity. A neighbour would occasionally drop food at the door. Others would help with chores. Total strangers a year prior were now entering in and out, in scenes reminiscent of 1980s Neighbours episodes. Upon reflection, wherever I lived abroad, the friends I developed were often those within a five-to-10-minute radius from home. After more than a year of practising my alcohol-free social skills, I can confirm I’ve progressed on from “beginner” mode. With each social interaction, my confidence grew. Where I felt awkward with groups – particularly drinking groups – a year ago, I now feel an ease. I can engage in conversation, laugh and partake in silly jokes, match energy levels and allow a less inhibited version of myself out of its cage. Lim describes this process of relearning as “trial and error”. I’m under no illusions that my new friendships are eternal, but interests and circumstances, largely brought on by the pandemic, have intersected at this specific juncture. A silver lining, perhaps, from 262 days of lockdown. The old adage that people who don’t drink are incapable of fun has been proven false, at least in my experience. All it took was practice.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Can you make friends without alcohol?

4/10/2022,"They are men who lived on the field, playing the game which helped to define them. But for some former AFL players, those moments of pain and glory have been washed away with such severe memory loss that they can no longer recall their most celebrated achievements, nor other significant details from their lives. Many are suffering in silence; some say they are too scared of the potential repercussions. Afraid of losing their jobs, or swallowing their pride, or of having to fight to get the help they need from a governing body they allege is doing “everything it can to deny, deny, deny” that football has a concussion problem. Others say they have already lost their families – ripped apart by their broken brains and all the hurt that can entail. Some are simply too sick to speak for themselves, in full-time care with degenerative diseases which will likely – based on the evidence to date – later be linked to a chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) diagnosis. Guardian Australia has spoken to six former players and their families as part of an investigation into the AFL’s response to concerns surrounding concussion in the sport. The majority are reluctant to publicly discuss the long-term effects of their repeated brain injuries sustained on the pitch. Almost all, though, say they have received little to no support from the sport’s governing body or, to a lesser extent, the AFL Player’s Association (AFPLA) , both of whom have a duty of care to protect their athletes. One says he has spent months chasing the AFL for brain scan results from studies they were involved in and follow-up care, while another family member has faced repeated “deflection” about funding. One former player says he has received “next to none” from either. “Obviously when you finish and it’s a career-ending injury there is a payment involved, but it is so is unbelievably subpar, especially in terms of the rest of your life,” he says. “And especially with concussions, depending on how bad it is, you can’t really work at all so it’s really hard to get an actual income. The money they offer should be substantial enough to keep you afloat for at least 10 years. “It seems like they’ve applied the same sort of blanket rule – that if someone finishes their career with a knee or something, it’s still shit, obviously, but it’s a knee – you’d be OK. But a brain injury, that couldn’t be more different – it could affect you in 30 years.” That player says he had a brain scan a few years ago on the recommendation of Dr Paul McCrory, the neurologist who last month resigned as chair of the global Concussion in Sport Group amid allegations of plagiarism. As revealed by the Guardian, McCrory is now the subject of an independent review launched by the AFL, for whom he was said to have led research, advised on concussion policies and treated and diagnosed athletes sustaining concussions and other serious head injuries. Australia’s medical regulator, Ahpra, is also investigating whether he treated patients in compliance with an enforceable undertaking he gave the body in 2018 to not perform certain neurodiagnostic procedures. That undertaking is still in place, and privacy laws prevent the regulator from disclosing why the undertaking was given. McCrory has not responded to requests for comment from the Guardian in relation to these matters. “It’s mind-boggling,” the player says. “For such a big enterprise … if you want to know how to handle it, just fucking ask the people who are going through it. It’s that simple. “I don’t know why [the AFL] are so afraid. I guess it’s money, but it’s not like they’ve got a shortage of it. You’d think it would just be a logical adult conversation to have with people, but I guess when money’s involved all logic goes out the window. “With the PA [the AFL Players Association] there is support, but it’s not like they’re going out of their way to offer it,” they say. “At the end of the day, they’re a union, and they apparently have the players’ best interests at heart. What frustrates me so much is just the lack of action. “It’s clearly a serious issue that’s been going on for a long time and there’s so much evidence around how it affects people, not just immediately but also in the long term.” A big piece of that long-term puzzle is CTE, the progressive and fatal brain disease which can only be diagnosed by autopsy. But signs of its presence in life include a range of symptoms, such as behavioural changes, mental health issues, impulse control problems, memory loss and other cognitive impairment along with degenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and epilepsy. Some past players who spoke in confidence to Guardian Australia suffer from such severe memory loss they can no longer operate normally in life. Some struggle with short-term memory, managing to stay employed by carrying around a notepad at work so they can quietly write down directions from managers or colleagues. Others endure debilitating headaches, unsettling aggression, depression and anxiety. Affected players and their families find it a baffling enough mystery on its own. Compounding the distress is what they describe as the laborious, and ultimately unhelpful, quasi-infrastructure that the game’s administrators insist is designed to support them. Part of the enigma is the confusing web of research projects, such as the AFL’s major study announced in 2014, from which the Guardian revealed no findings or reports have ever been published. One ex-player says he had scans through the AFL, most recently at the start of 2021. After the latter, he chased the governing body repeatedly – and unsuccessfully – for his results. “I did all the tests the AFL wanted me to do,” he says. “And then when it came to me finding out information from the actual specialist, it was like six months later and they still hadn’t got me an appointment with a specialist. I’ve still never found out what happened with those last test results, so the AFL’s got all the data on them. I’ve got no idea. “I was pretty pissed off with that, to be honest.” A medical consultant for the AFL told him that it was difficult to obtain a timely appointment with specialists in his city of residence. The consultant assured him the program’s primary objectives were to provide players with information and a long-term management plan. He says he was booked an appointment almost 12 months after his scan, which he could not attend due to another unavoidable commitment, but that the AFL had since become more responsive. “In 2014 they said that I was like an anomaly compared to the other players that they tested in that I had scars on my brain. And I wasn’t a heavy drinker or drug user. But I wouldn’t be able to say the same [now] – my life’s deteriorated a lot since then. “That article on Andrew Macpherson rocked me pretty big. I was just, like, it’s very similar symptoms to what I’ve got. I’ve done about four weeks’ work all this year. The most I’ve worked in a week is probably 15 hours.” Shaun Smith, the former Melbourne and North Melbourne player who in 2020 was awarded a landmark $1.4m insurance payout recognising “total and permanent disablement” caused by the brain injuries he sustained during his 11-year career, was not involved in the AFL’s 2014 study. “I wasn’t part of that, I wasn’t asked,” Smith says. “I didn’t even know it was on, to be honest. But with [John] Barnes they came back and said, ‘there’s nothing wrong with you’, so it would’ve been a waste of time anyway. “My take on it is they’re basically trying to do everything they can to deny, deny, deny that there’s actually an issue. The PA actually helped me out a little bit with some counselling and financially as well, which I appreciate greatly.” Another former player, who has experienced major memory loss, says it is understandable that many – including himself – feel the need to remain anonymous. “If you’re out there saying how you’ve got real issues with concussion and stuff like that, it’s difficult to get a job,” he says. “It’s not in their best interests to be going out there saying they’ve been knocked out 10 times and they’re not feeling well all the time.” This player wants to remain unnamed to preserve the last sliver of his identity not defined by his brain injuries. “I see blokes all the time who aren’t well, who’ve got real issues with their wives,” he says. “Even the wives talk about their issues. Like it’s just, it’s pretty sad. It’s hard for the wives as well, putting up with the moods, the aggression, all those things. They’re the ones bearing the brunt of it, really.” This player did not take part in any AFL studies. For him, it was “very much” a trust issue. “The problem is if they start agreeing to doing everything for everyone, it’s not good for them legally, which is a big problem,” he says. “It’s just frustrating.” He is one of a number of former players to have had their brains tested through a 2013 Deakin University study which found memory, reflexes and muscle coordination could all be impaired by concussive and sub-concussive impacts. Another player, who also took part in the independent Deakin study, says he did so because there was, at that stage, no option to do so through the AFL. “Obviously it showed a bit of damage, but that was 10 years ago,” he says. “I’ve recently just got done some through Melbourne University, so [I’m] just waiting [on those results].” The wife of a former player, whose condition has deteriorated so rapidly he is in respite care in his 60s, had a different experience with the AFLPA. Over the past couple of years she has repeatedly contacted the AFLPA’s alumni program in the hope it could uphold its pledge to provide “all past players [with] access to free and confidential services, including psychological and concussion support, doctors’ network and the AFL Players’ Injury and Hardship Fund”. “I asked, ‘You have an injury and hardship fund as part of the alumni, how do you access that?’” she says. “And they said, ‘Well, that’s only for people who are absolutely broke, and most of them have mental health issues, they’ve had to be institutionalised or they have drug addictions’. That was the response.” She said she was offered access to a counselling service for herself. The AFLPA, in a statement to Guardian Australia, said its $4m a year Players’ Injury and Hardship Fund – paid for by player funds allocated as part of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement with the AFL – allows past players to apply to be reimbursed for “medical costs associated with joint surgery, dental and members facing financial hardship, along with career-ending injury support”. “Players who retire due to career ending injuries, including concussion, are eligible to apply to the fund, which has assisted more than 600 past players with more than $9m for issues stemming from their playing careers since it was established in 2017,” it said. “We continue to advocate strongly for more research and support for players with concussion issues to be provided by the industry.” When asked, the AFLPA did not specify a formal criteria for who can access the fund. It says it “takes concussion very seriously” but does not, at this stage, have plans for a concussion-specific fund to assist – financially or otherwise – players and their families navigating the longer-term ramifications of repeated traumatic brain injuries sustained in their place of work. The AFLPA and AFL are negotiating a new CBA, with the current one due to expire at the end of October. The AFL said, via a spokesperson, that it had committed to “reviewing the arrangements for providing financial and/or other assistance to former elite players suffering financial and other difficulties later in life that may be attributable to concussion or head trauma sustained during their professional footballing careers”. “That work is ongoing,” the spokesperson said. “Separately, the AFL’s Past Player Program provides coordinated neuropsychological assessment, imaging/scans and clinician assessment to past elite players suffering neurological and/or cognitive deficits in retirement. The AFL is currently undertaking a review of the Past Player Program with consideration of further clinical care and support being offered to past players in need.” The wife of the player in care has also been writing to the AFL, including the chief executive, Gillon McLachlan. “There’s so much deflection when you ask questions about what’s happening with funding,” she says. “There’s been a lot of media about some funding that’s there for the players who’ve been affected. And so much deflection about studies. “It blows my mind that they can’t, that there’s just nothing. They seem to spend so much money on research and surveys and things like that, and it doesn’t seem to get anywhere.” She says her husband had been due to take part in AFL-run brain scans, which the family welcomed, but had to postpone when he was suddenly admitted to hospital. He is one of numerous past players who intend to join a planned concussion class action against the AFL. “It’s you against the AFL and the PA,” says another player who has signed up. “Because everyone’s got vested interests and they’re all protecting themselves. You get that initial support. Great. Everyone does when they finish playing. But then you’re in the dark for the rest of it.” Know more?

4/10/2022,"Zara* believes she and her children wouldn’t be alive today were it not for the support she received while at a family violence refuge in New Zealand tailored to her cultural needs. “The mainstream refuge didn’t understand the seriousness of abuse the ethnic women go through,” Zara said. “I have been told by my own family, community and society to reconcile so many times and every time the abuse worsens. “It’s the cultural impact that puts the pressure on us and we have to sacrifice everything for others.” However, Zara was helped by social workers at a refuge run by Shakti – an organisation that supports women, children and families of Asian, African and Middle Eastern origin. She said while she received the basic necessities and accommodation, the workers also spoke the same language as her, related to her situation and provided her with the skills to become self-reliant. Shakti has a presence in Victoria, where it runs a crisis call service and offers case management, counselling, training programs and educational workshops. But it does not receive enough funding to run a refuge in the state. Unlike Queensland and New South Wales, Victoria has no culturally specific family violence refuges. Veena Barsiwal, a Melbourne-based counsellor for Shakti, said the women she works with need tailored support given the unique challenges they face, such as forced or underage marriage, dowry abuse, visa insecurity, isolation and shame. “Our beliefs are very deep-rooted. I had this one client who was facing abuse, and she told her parents, and her father said, ‘I would rather have a divorced daughter than have a dead daughter’ but she did not leave because she didn’t want to face the stigma of divorce,” she says. “Here was this younger woman, who worked and was earning good money and she had her parents’ support but it was so ingrained in her that she will fail completely if she leaves. It’s something only a person from the same background can understand.” In 2020, a Victorian coroner called for more accessible, culturally appropriate support services for South Asian women in the city of Whittlesea after an investigation into the suicides of four women in the community between 2018 and 2019. The coroner ruled the evidence did not provide “a comfortable level of satisfaction to find that family violence was a precipitating factor” in the deaths, though there were serious allegations of family violence in two of the cases. This came four years after a Victorian royal commission into family violence found that people from multicultural, faith and ethnic communities are disproportionately affected by family violence and face additional barriers to seeking safety and justice. The government has implemented six of the seven recommendations the inquiry made in respect to people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities. “We know that family violence can occur in any community and access to culturally appropriate support is critical – which is why we’re building a family violence system that is inclusive, accessible, responsive and safe for all members of the Victorian community,” the minister for prevention of family violence, Gabrielle Williams, said in a statement. Applications for grants of up to $250,000 are currently open for projects that support partnerships and collaboration between Victoria’s multicultural community organisations and specialist family violence and sexual assault services, while $7m was provided in 2021 to provide culturally appropriate primary prevention and early intervention initiatives. Barsiwal said women need to enter an environment where they feel safe and comfortable if they decide to leave an abusive relationship. “Women need to feel that they aren’t being judged, that they don’t need to explain themselves, that they can speak their language, eat the food they want to eat or the prayers they want to perform,” she said. “Otherwise, if they don’t feel comfortable, or they feel overwhelmed, they’ll end up going back to the perpetrator and it’s always harder when they go back because the abuse gets worse.” Saleha Singh, from IndianCare, a community welfare organisation that assists women fleeing family violence, supports international students and provides drug and alcohol education, said they have been inundated with calls for help during the pandemic. “Even big charities and organisations with much more funding than us are calling us up saying please help us, we don’t have culturally appropriate information for women,” she said. “We deal with primary prevention and early intervention but I can’t tell you how many calls we are getting from women seeking legal support, financial support to pay for the bills, nappies, school fees. We don’t have the funding to keep up.” Singh said there was a lack of education in the community about family violence and its many forms, including economic and technology-related abuse, coercive and controlling behaviours and marital rape. “Sometimes people think because it’s not physical violence, it is not family violence. Nobody talks about it and sometimes women don’t even realise it’s happening because it’s what they’ve grown up with. We should not accept it any more,” she said. Shakti and IndianCare, as well as several other multicultural organisations and support services, have formed a group called the Multicultural Alliance of Women Against Family Violence in an effort to secure funding for a refuge in Victoria. The Victorian Greens leader, Samantha Ratnam, has previously called on the government to establish a culturally specific refuge, which she says would cost about $5m to set up. “Ideally though, what you want to see is a network of culturally specific refuges, geographically dispersed so that everyone has equitable access to them, as is the case with Shakti in New Zealand,” Ratnam said. * Name has been changed for privacy reasons In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14 and the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732.

4/10/2022,"The former speaker Tony Smith has urged Josh Frydenberg to allow the corporate regulator to decide claims against itself, after investors had no one to resolve their bid for compensation over a failed retirement village empire. Smith, acting in his capacity as chair of a parliamentary committee with oversight of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic), also criticised Treasury’s position that the treasurer could not decide claims against Asic under a government program known as the scheme for compensation for detriment caused by defective administration (CDDA). The issue was brought to the parliamentary joint committee on corporations and financial services by the Labor MP Julian Hill after Guardian Australia revealed that investors seeking $200m in compensation from Asic over the collapse of retirement village group Prime Trust were unable to get either Asic or Treasury to decide their claim. Asic said its authority to decide CDDA claims lapsed in 2015, while Treasury claimed that Frydenberg could not decide claims against Asic because it would interfere with the regulator’s operational independence. But in letter to Frydenberg on a 23 March, Smith said the idea the treasurer was barred from deciding CDDA claims against Asic was “a change in position which contradicts the practice in previous years”. “The committee also notes that Treasury’s advice that the treasurer is unable to decide claims against Asic under the CDDA scheme has failed to adequately address the question as to why the treasurer cannot do so and simply pay any compensation from consolidated revenue, thus avoiding a direction to Asic to pay compensation,” Smith said. He said that the committee “considers that it is desirable as a matter of policy and practice in the future that Asic can be authorised to receive and consider claims under the CDDA scheme”. “Accordingly, the committee recommends that the government make such legislative or policy changes as are necessary to overcome any barriers to any treasurer in the future authorising Asic to determine claims under the CDDA scheme.” But any change to the rules would not be retrospective, leaving the Prime Trust investors in the hands of the treasurer. “The treasurer’s claim that he cannot consider the Prime Trust claim under the CDDA scheme is dubious and he does appear to have the power,” Hill said. “Nonetheless, the next treasurer should act to remove any doubt or ambiguity and ensure that Asic, the corporate regulator, is subject to the CDDA scheme like any other public entity, and accountable for their performance in the future.” The investors, represented by the Prime Trust Action Group, lodged their CDDA claim with Asic more than three years ago but it has not progressed due to the legal catch-22. They claimed Asic erred because it granted a financial services license to the company which controlled Prime Trust, Australian Property Custodian Holdings. Asic should not have trusted that Prime Trust’s founder, Bill Lewski, possessed the good fame and character required to be named a key person on the licence, the investors said in their CDDA claim. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Prime Trust collapsed in 2010, taking with it $550m invested by more than 9,000 unit holders and sparking years of litigation involving Lewski, other directors, investors and the corporate regulator. In October 2019 the full federal court banned Lewski from running a company for 15 years and fined him $230,000. Steve O’Reilly, a representative for Prime Trust Action Group, said that Asic demanded accountability from participants in the financial services industry but “the treasurer’s failure to authorise Asic to determine CDDA claims provides an opportunity for Asic to avoid accountability”. “As the regulator of the financial services industry, and as an agency which was heavily criticised by the Hayne royal commission, if Asic is not accountable, then investors can simply have no trust in this organisation,” O’Reilly said. “We would welcome a scenario where Asic and Treasury show leadership and welcome accountability and scrutiny, especially when such scrutiny comes from the very investors that Asic claims to represent and protect.” A spokesperson for Frydenberg did not answer Guardian Australia’s questions but repeated earlier statements that Asic’s governing laws prohibited the treasurer from deciding CDDA claims against it. “However, investors in the Prime Trust are able to seek compensation by making an application to the Department of Finance for an act of grace payment under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013, and are able to achieve the same practical outcome as could have been achieved under the CDDA scheme,” the spokesperson said.",News/Australia news,Government urged to allow Asic to decide claims against itself after investors left in limbo,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/10/government-urged-to-allow-asic-to-decide-claims-against-itself-after-investors-left-in-limbo
4/10/2022,"Every day, Solomiya Rozhko wakes up inside an apartment in Brisbane and asks herself: “Is it over?” “You just want it to be over,” Rozhko says of the war in Ukraine. “You want your family and friends and your country to be safe.” As claims emerge of civilian executions, mass graves and atrocities such as rape, Rozhko watches what is unfolding in her homeland with horror. This week, hundreds of bodies were discovered lying in the streets of Bucha after Ukrainian forces recaptured the territory from Russian troops. “The atrocities are immense,” Rozhko says. “I think the world is yet to see the extent of what’s happened.“I know if I was in those towns working, I could have been killed.” The 43-year-old arrived in Brisbane on 24 March with just three sweaters, a couple of pairs of jeans, her computer and some documents inside a small suitcase. She is finding it challenging to get used to her “new reality”. “It’s a very painful situation because Ukraine is my homeland,” she says. “It’s where I work and where I grew up, where I went to school.” More than four million people have left Ukraine since the Russian invasion began, with millions more displaced inside the country. The president of the Ukrainian Community of Queensland, Peter Bongiorni, says he is aware that up to 80 people have recently arrived in south-east Queensland from all over Ukraine – most of them on tourist visas. “As soon as the war started, the … advice coming from the immigration department was to get people on tourist visas,” Bongiorni says. “[They said] then we’ll work with you on getting them a refugee visa. “The tourist visa is the quickest way to get into our country … instead of having to find documentation to prove your status.” Rozhko was among those to secure a temporary visitor visa, before moving into her mother’s apartment in Coorparoo. Australia announced a temporary three-year humanitarian visa for Ukrainians who were forced to flee Russia’s military invasion in March, allowing people to work, study and access Medicare. Since 23 February, the government has granted more than 6,000 visas to Ukrainians in Ukraine, with the majority being temporary visas, a spokesperson from the Department of Home Affairs says. As of 3 April, more than 1,600 of these visa holders have arrived in Australia, according to the department. Bongiorni says those with Australian visas who are still in Ukraine may be stalled by issues with their vaccination status, or their documents being destroyed in the war. “While Australia at a federal level has said as long as you can prove your identity we’ll let you in, I know some of the airlines still require passports to be shown,” Bongiorni says. “So there’s some logistical issues around working through that.” He says it’s also possible that some Ukrainians may have found safe havens in European countries and decided to go elsewhere. “I daresay there’d also be people that have applied but just don’t have the funding to be able to buy their tickets. So they’re just biding their time to save their money.” Rozhko didn’t bide her time. When the war broke out in February she was on a work trip in Lviv, the city where she was born, near the Polish border. She woke up to a series of missed calls from concerned family members and friends. “I opened the news and was horrified with what I saw with all the bombings all over Ukraine,” she says. Planes weren’t flying at the time but Rozhko, who works for the EU advisory mission in Ukraine, was able to find a route out through Poland with some of her colleagues. “It’s a very traumatic event and it’s very hard to fathom because … we never believed we would witness a war in our homeland during our lives.” Rozhko fears returning home to Kharkiv, a city about 40km from the Russian border, where she had been living for the past five years. Once Ukraine’s second most populous city, parts of Kharkiv have been turned to rubble from constant shelling by Russian forces. As the war rages on, she worries about her future. “Australia has been quite welcoming, but I think further thought should be given to how people can remain here … because at this point, we don’t see the war ending anytime soon,” she says. The Department of Home Affairs says the government “will provide further advice” to support the transition of Ukrainians on to temporary humanitarian visas “in due course”. It says additional support will provided to help with access to long-term accommodation and to Medicare. The Ukrainian Community of Queensland is also providing food and clothing to those who have recently arrived, as well as assisting them with enrolling children in schools and immigration support. “We have worked with the Queensland government, so there is free quarantine for those who can’t prove Covid vaccination status and we’ve got an arrangement where any emergency health needs will be covered by the Queensland government for those who don’t have insurance or access to Medicare,” Bongiorni says. He says some may choose to return to Ukraine, but others may want to stay in Australia. “There’s definitely some that want to go back when it’s safe to do so to rebuild their country but some would prefer to stay because they already have family here,” Bongiorni says. For Rozhko, there’s a patriotic passion for Ukrainian sovereignty and self-determination that has materialised in the past month. “Ukrainians are fighting for their future now, and they’re fighting for the choices that they’ve made continuously in the last 30 years since becoming independent,” she says.“It’s about protecting your identity, protecting who you are and who you want to be and protecting the next generation.” In Australia, support is available at Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636, Lifeline on 13 11 14, and at MensLine on 1300 789 978. In the UK, the charity Mind is available on 0300 123 3393 and Childline on 0800 1111.

4/10/2022,"In 2013, my mum Lenore was diagnosed with a rare neurodegenerative illness. This sickness – a sadistic killer – was resolutely incurable. “It’s the worst-case scenario,” said the neurologist, who had a model of a human brain on his desk. “Like having Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s at the same time, for a long time.” Uh-huh: this explained mum’s escalating physical clumsiness, mood swings and memory lapses. Alcohol was merely the coping mechanism, not the cause. She would gradually lose the ability to chew food and string coherent sentences together, and eventually the capacity to speak, move or ultimately breathe. “I just want to stay at home,” she said. And then: “Until the end.” Mum was 59. I was 21. We shared identical hazel green eyes. Hers were wet. Mine were dry. I wasn’t trying not to cry. But I was on a first name basis with worst-case scenarios. And there were just so many bloody logistics to consider. “You might need to think about a nursing home placement,” said the neurologist. “And sooner rather than later.” That summer, I floundered south-west from Brisbane to my hometown of Toowoomba. I discovered a new to-do list on the fridge: book a haircut, buy a lotto ticket, and sign up for a funeral plan. Often, I found mum standing at the back door staring into the 3am blackness. “I forgot what I want,” she said, a terrifying mixture of tenses for someone traditionally so literate. Richard Fidler once remarked he knew of only two people who enjoyed reading parliamentary hansards: Gough Whitlam and my grade nine dropout, autodidact mother. Mum believed in a social safety net, because she knew how easy it was to slip between the cracks. That’s why she decided to become a foster carer after half-a-dozen miscarriages. She and my dad fostered hundreds of kids, including five permanents. Mum took the hard cases without reservations, such as my sister Hannah. She was born in the bathtub of a three-star motel in New Zealand to mentally ill parents on the run from Australian police. My mother fell pregnant a few days after Hannah’s arrival. It was her first pregnancy that made it past the three-month mark. Miraculously, mum had me at the age of 38. At night, she checked my cot like it was a safe containing a million-dollar bill. Hannah was two years older than me, but the two of us became best friends. Mum colour-coordinated our second-hand outfits, as if we were identical twins. By the time I reached high school, the whip-smart foster carer from my childhood was growing irritable and ham-fisted. Most of the changes had been slow and attributed to alcohol consumption. After the diagnosis, I realised that my stone-cold sober mother was undeniably dying. Her feet and shins were chipped with sores from where she’d kicked the bricks. Mum qualified for a disability support pension and Meals on Wheels, but not the NDIS. My siblings lived interstate or hours away. I was barely capable of looking after myself at the best of times. Now I was medically responsible for a dead woman walking and frequently falling. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The feet wounds grew infected and turned her delirious. One day, she couldn’t leave the couch in the lounge room. Mum pleaded with me not to call an ambulance, dreading a date with a nursing home director. But I was on the brink of breakdown after just a month of providing utterly substandard care. So I called triple zero. Mum wailed like a baby on the way to the hospital. This was the direct opposite of childbirth. We both knew that she wasn’t going home. “Who’s going to look after Barnesy?” she asked, referring to her adopted mongrel dog named after Jimmy Barnes. Mum spent a month in hospital. My sister Hannah – a psychology student – came back from Melbourne for Christmas. We donated mum’s novels and furniture to Lifeline – where she’d volunteered – and took the unwanted stuff to the dump. I rehomed Barnesy. An enthusiastic real estate agent hammered a “For Sale” sign into the front lawn. Unbeknownst to mum, the hospital provided brochures for nursing homes. I chose what was supposed to be the best of a bad bunch. There was a room available, and the hospital needed her bed. So I hastily signed my mother’s life away. Mum moved into the aged care facility a few days before her 60th birthday. Hannah baked a cake. The patient stared vacantly through cobwebbed windows into the unweeded courtyard. “This is nice,” she said unconvincingly. That day, a light expired in my mother’s eyes. She later came to Hannah’s wedding, held grandchildren, and watched me embark on a writing career. In family pictures, mum covered twitching lips with a slender hand, pale and veiny and forever trembling. I was crying on the inside in all of those smiling photos. We made no new memories together untainted by pre-emptive pain. My mother picked a particularly inhumane epoch in Australian politics to get sick. Her underfunded nursing home made little effort to assist patients who couldn’t get themselves to group activities. One-on-one time with carers was limited. She didn’t mesh with the much older but less evidently demented patients, so ate dinner alone in a wood-panelled room while rapidly deteriorating. As many in the aged care sector know, you can pinpoint John Howard’s 1997 Aged Care Act as a turning point. It led to widespread privatisation of the sector. Nursing homes were no longer legally required to roster a registered nurse 24/7. Beforehand, a typical 60-bed nursing home received funding for 308 hours a week from registered nurses. Within a decade, it had declined to 198 hours. By 2021, it was 168 hours a week, wrote Rick Morton in the Saturday Paper. Julia Gillard’s government hastened the privatisation of nursing homes, while trying to increase the wages of aged care nurses. In 2013, Tony Abbott abolished those proposed pay rises. He also cut government funding for patients with dementia-like symptoms, such as my mum. In 2016, mum was transferred to the high-care section. She received a level of attention that might’ve been the bare minimum two years earlier. There were purple bruises on her protruding hips from slipping over. I was routinely notified that she’d been found lying on the linoleum since overnight. Mum was sometimes rushed back to hospital because no registered nurses were present. Mum never complained once. Not about the shithouse dinners, or noticeable lack of staff, nor their ignorance about her condition. Even then she sided with the employees, most of them working-class migrant women who weren’t acting maliciously. My mother could see that they were overstretched, underpaid, and largely untrained to deal with such a debilitating impairment. My sister Hannah sent escalating complaints. Nothing much changed. The neglect existed in a grey area. There were no gross hygiene breaches or acts of physical abuse. There just weren’t enough staff for the number of patients, or staff with the requisite expertise to prevent unnecessary hospitalisations. By then, Hannah was a neuropsychologist in the public health system. She’d moved to the Gold Coast with her husband Jay, a physiotherapist. In 2018, they found a new nursing home for mum near Burleigh Heads. Her quality of life drastically improved. Partly because we could afford to pay the extra weekly cost. Partly because staff ratios and catering were better. And largely because my mother had a daughter and son-in-law uniquely qualified to wrangle with the opaque aged care and disability sectors. How many people in our situation would have just given up, or not been able to make that much of a difference? Whatever the case, there were no miracles. My mother’s skin grew sickly, cheeks gaunter, and eyes more haunted. In July 2018, Hannah brought her to the finish line of the Gold Coast marathon, which I completed in three hours and thirty-three minutes. Mum was four knots of skin and bone in a wheelchair. But I could detect a wry smile and hint of pride. “Nobody’s going to forget what you’ve done,” I whispered at the end of my final visit, after a 30-minute hug. “I love you, Mum.” My mother didn’t want to let go. “I love you more,” she implored me. A few days later, she died in her sleep. She soon received approval for the NDIS. It was too late. It is truly difficult to fathom the institutionalised cruelty of Australia’s aged care system. Politicians continue to make euthanasia elusive for people with neurodegenerative illnesses, while underfunding the nursing homes where many of them rot away. A few months after mum’s death, Four Corners exposed severe neglect within aged care. Scott Morrison announced a royal commission. It discovered that 39.8% of patients suffer abuse. There were stomach-churning accounts of malnourishment. A grieving daughter recalled discovering maggots breeding in her mother’s heel. A specialist estimated fifty sexual assaults a week occur in nursing homes. This was before the pandemic exacerbated staff shortages and the isolation of patients, hundreds of whom died during Covid outbreaks. Last week, Anthony Albanese released an aged care policy promising to improve staffing, accountability and nutrition at a cost of $2.5bn over four years. Labor’s plan would mandate the 24/7 presence of a registered nurse, and mandate 215 minutes of care per day, per patient. Albanese also promised to support the wage claim of aged care workers. Australia barely pays minimum wage to the people who deal with disability and death on a daily basis. A pay rise will cost billions of dollars. But there is no other way to attract skilled personnel back to the sector. “We are going to put the nurses back into nursing homes,” said Albanese. Where, the Coalition asked, would Labor find $625m a year? Let alone the extra billions should the Fair Work Commission award workers a pay rise. Yet Morrison also claimed he would respect the commission’s decision, without outlining where the funding for those pay rises would come from. Labor’s policies should be critiqued. But it was grimly predictable this was the budget announcement provoking the shrillest accusations of economic illiteracy. “If you cannot manage the nation’s finances then you can’t pay for aged care,” said Morrison in Question Time. Howls of outrage about Labor came from the same government that effectively donated $5.5bn to the French government so they could spend potentially $171bn on American nuclear submarines. The same government that funnelled $10.3bn to fossil fuel subsidies in 2020/2021. The same government that squandered approximately $38bn on jobkeeper payments to profitable companies. The same government promising tax cuts for wealthy Australians that will plunder $184bn from the budget over a decade. Treasurers and defence ministers are free to piss money up against the wall, particularly Liberal ones. But those who advocate spending on childcare, education, aged care and the NDIS are framed as bleeding heart socialists, despite the vast emotional and economic dividends from investing in them. Eighteen months after she died, Hannah named her first child “Lennie”, short for Lenore. Hannah works for a clinic supporting children with disabilities in Alice Springs. She is like my mum on intellectual steroids. Lennie believes that her namesake is smiling from the dusty sky during sunrise and sunset. “Morning, Grandma!” Lennie grins. “Night-night, Grandma!” she sings. No grief, just love. Mum dedicated her life to sheltering children who couldn’t protect themselves. Multiple times she broke intergenerational cycles of child abuse and poverty. Lennie is the direct beneficiary. In sickness, my mother received no such sanctuary. She was always going to die. But she didn’t need to suffer so horrifically in the process. Governments can’t legislate against the guilt I feel about her experiences. But Australia – one of the richest countries on earth – can afford to pay aged care workers a fair wage, and invest heavily in the development of registered nurses for the aged care system. More broadly, our aging population can’t enjoy everlasting tax cuts, while also treating the elderly and disabled with basic dignity. Something must give. The question is whether leaders – and the voters who elect them – are willing to sacrifice tax cuts for the wellbeing of complete strangers. It is much easier to look away. Life is hard enough without confronting the suffering of others. But we must bear witness to these indignities. The people most affected by neglect are incapable of protecting themselves. And one day they could be us.",News/Australia news,"Mum dedicated her life to protecting others.

4/10/2022,"Senior Conservatives have written off Rishi Sunak as a potential prime minister – and now believe Boris Johnson will have to remove him as chancellor in his next reshuffle – following the furore over his US green card and his wife’s tax affairs. One former Tory minister told the Observer that the fear among Conservative MPs with small majorities was that the party was now in a “death spiral” with its two leading figures – the PM and chancellor – both having lost respect among voters. “The worry is that this is symptomatic of a party in terminal decline and that we are in a death spiral,” said the ex-minister, after Sunak’s multimillionaire wife, Akshata Murty, agreed to pay UK tax on her global fortune, having avoided doing so under rules that apply to people who opt for non-domiciled status. Referring to the entire controversy and revelations about the couple having had US green cards, the ex-minister added: “That is the concern of colleagues with small majorities. “He has shown colossal naivety and the way he has arranged his affairs does not suggest he is even committed to the UK, but that he is keeping open the option of a career in finance in the United States.” On Friday it also emerged that the chancellor and Murty had both held US green cards, meaning they had registered themselves as permanent residents in the US. In a development that shocked many Tories, it was confirmed that Sunak held the green card for a period of 19 months when he was chancellor and in charge of UK finances. The issue was even raised at a White House briefing on Friday evening. A former Tory cabinet minister said Sunak was clearly damaged and would not stand any chance in a leadership contest if one was held in the coming months. The way he had arranged his family’s affairs had shown his political judgment to be badly flawed and raised questions about whether his leadership chances could ever be revived, he said. A third senior figure in the party said the controversy of recent days had demonstrated how quickly a once-stellar career could go into reverse, to a point from which it would be difficult to recover. “The timing is terrible. I think his problem is that taxes have gone up a lot in his period as chancellor, which is not popular in the party or country. And we have a cost-of-living crisis. None of this looks good.” It was reported that removal vans had been seen in Downing Street yesterday and that Murty and the two children would live at their west London home with Sunak remaining at No 11 during the working week. Johnson is believed to be considering a ministerial reshuffle in the summer or autumn. There are known to have been tensions between No 10 and No 11 after the chancellor offered only lukewarm support to Johnson at the height of the scandal over lockdown-busting parties, before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A government source said: “I don’t see the PM resisting this opportunity to move Rishi now.” The latest Opinium poll for the Observer finds that Sunak’s approval rating has dropped to a new low of -15, making him only slightly less unpopular than Johnson himself. Only four months ago, when he was firm favourite to succeed Johnson if the PM was toppled over parties at No 10, the chancellor’s approval rating stood at a very healthy plus 11. All opposition parties are now determined to keep up pressure on Sunak over in the coming weeks. Labour and the Liberal Democrats called on Murty, who remains an Indian citizen, not just to begin paying tax on her overseas earnings but also to pay back what she had saved over recent years. Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said that while her “non-dom” status had been legal, Sunak, who claimed last week that she was victim of a smear campaign, had failed to be transparent about his family’s tax status at a time when he was raising taxes for millions of people. “He has come out on a number of occasions to try and muddy the waters around this and to obfuscate,” she said. In a statement on Friday, Murty, who is to keep India as her “place of domicile”, said she had done nothing wrong but acknowledged some people did not see her tax status as being compatible with her husband’s position. “I understand and appreciate the British sense of fairness and I do not wish my tax status to be a distraction for my husband or to affect my family,” she said. “I do this because I want to, not because the rules require me to.” By retaining her non-domicile status she will in future be able to save huge sums in inheritance tax. Murty has assets of at least £690m in her father’s company, Infosys. The Liberal Democrats have drawn up draft legislation aimed at forcing the chancellor and any other government ministers to reveal whether they or their spouses claim non-domiciled status or have holdings in overseas tax havens. Daniel Beizsley, a researcher with the charity Spotlight on Corruption, said the fact that Sunak had a blind trust through which his financial interests were handed over to an independent trustee raised issues over potential conflicts of interest. “By having this arrangement in place, Sunak is preventing any proper scrutiny of his financial interests and is the only current member of the cabinet taking this approach. The system of blind trusts needs to be rethought to include at least a summary of their contents if they are relevant to a minister’s brief to give the public a better understanding of any potential conflicts.”",News/Politics,"Rishi Sunak’s hopes of becoming prime minister are over, say top Tories",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/09/rishi-sunaks-hopes-of-becoming-prime-minister-are-over-say-top-tories
