2/25/2022,"After warning medical professionals to be on the lookout for a baffling neurological condition that produced memory loss, muscle wasting and severe cognitive decline, authorities in the Canadian province of New Brunswick have concluded that no such illness exists, a finding that has prompted skepticism and disbelief as families search for answers. New Brunswick officials last year flagged a possible “cluster” of residents suffering from an unknown neurological syndrome, similar to those of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Symptoms were varied and dramatic: some patients started drooling, and others felt as though bugs were crawling on their skin.  On Thursday, the province released the findings of its oversight committee, concluding that none of the 48 cases met the definition of an unknown brain syndrome and that the victims were instead likely suffering from known diseases. “The oversight committee has unanimously agreed that these 48 people should never have been identified as having a neurological syndrome of unknown cause, and that based on the evidence reviewed, no such syndrome exists,” Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health for New Brunswick, told reporters Thursday. “But I stress again, this does not mean that these people aren’t seriously ill. It means they are ill with a known neurological condition.” But the province’s conclusion is unlikely to satisfy family members, many of whom have watched helplessly as those close to them quickly deteriorate. A previous report released by the province found no environmental exposures that linked the patients together, leading families to suspect the province was prepared to rule out existence of a cluster. “You always hang on to a sliver of hope and [that] they’ll reverse course,” said Steve Ellis, whose father Roger was diagnosed in 2019. “But they did the opposite.” Ellis said he and other families met the province’s health minister and chief medical officer before the release of the report. “They didn’t answer any of our questions. It was political theatre at its worst,” he said. “I knew wasn’t going to be good. But I didn’t expect it to be this hurtful.” In recent weeks, families of those within the cluster, including Ellis, received letters from the provincial government, suggesting they may have a yet-undiagnosed condition. The report also cast doubt on the work of Dr Alier Marrero, the New Brunswick doctor who first flagged the cluster and has treated most of the patients, saying it “could not conclude that the main referring neurologist had sought second opinions” when diagnosing cases. In the future, the committee recommended a second specialist review cases to determine whether a patient has a new and unknown disease. The Guardian has seen a letter sent last week in which Marrero pleaded for help to Canada’s chief public health officer Theresa Tam, and to Russell, New Brunswick’s chief medical officer. Marrero wrote that he had a backlog of 100 patients referred to him by other doctors whose symptoms appeared to fit the case description, but lacked the resources to investigate each case. Marrero wrote that he was “quite concerned” how many young people were in that backlog of cases. Officials at Thursday’s press conference disputed they had been advised that multiple households had more than one member showing neurological symptoms. But Marrero’s letter warned of at least 12 households with multiple cases, a finding he said raised concerns over “potential human-to-human transmission or a possible common root cause” of the suspected illness. “With these latest developments, I am concerned for my patients and, from a public health standpoint, for the general population,” he wrote. “I believe there is an urgency to act promptly and use all means necessary to investigate and get to the roots cause or causes of the above issues.” Kat Lanteigne, executive director of Bloodwatch, said officials presenting the report had “misled the public” about the scope of possible cases, and said the latest report lacked scientific rigour. “It’s a sham. It’s an absolute public health sham,” said Kat Lanteigne, executive director of Bloodwatch. “They haven’t done any additional testing. They have not tested for neurotoxins. They did not run a control group for their epidemiological study. Their data is wholly insufficient.” Experts have previously told the Guardian it is possible for patients to have known diseases that are triggered by a common cause. Lanteigne, who has been in contact with families, says she has advised them to get legal counsel as they explore their options to “hold both the government of New Brunswick and the Public Health Agency of Canada accountable for their failings”. “These families are being crushed and they need help,” she said. “They need answers.”",News/World news,Victims dismayed as Canadian inquiry finds mystery syndrome does not exist,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/canada-new-brunswick-mystery-illness-syndrome
2/25/2022,"Borussia Dortmund were the favourites to win the Europa League before this tie with Rangers. By the time it concluded – sadly though that was for neutrals – the Germans found themselves eliminated from the competition. For Giovanni van Bronckhorst, who has watched Rangers stutter on the domestic front, this felt a hugely significant success.  Rangers had a the aim of not wasting the lead earned by an outstanding display at Signal Iduna Park and duly delivered. Dortmund’s showing amid a raucous atmosphere on Glasgow’s south side was markedly better than in front of their own support but they proved unable to turn the tide. Over 180 minutes, Rangers played the more effective football. Van Bronckhorst and his team will bounce into the last 16, with Marco Rose left to field questions regarding what will be an embarrassing outcome for Dortmund. High praise of Rangers’ first leg performance, while valid, required context. Unfortunately for Van Bronckhorst and his players, 90 minutes of the tie remained against a free-scoring side. Indeed, Dortmund recovered from their home loss to Rangers by trouncing Borussia Mönchengladbach 6-0 at the weekend. Prior to this game, Dortmund had played seven in 2022 that had featured more than 40 goals. They were highly unlikely to fire blanks in Glasgow. Unsurprisingly, the German side opened positively. Jude Bellingham bundled the ball against Allan McGregor’s left-hand post from a Julian Brandt corner inside four minutes. Donyell Malen’s snapshot from just outside the area bounced narrowly wide. Rangers had been forced into their defensive third for the majority of the first quarter, adding to the craziness of Brandt’s next key involvement. Ryan Kent, who starred in Germany, was facing away from goal and offering no particular threat at all when Brandt dropped a lazy leg into his path. As Kent toppled, a penalty was the straightforward outcome. James Tavernier slotted it home, high down the middle of Gregor Kobel’s goal. Rangers, having been outplayed, now had a three-goal advantage. Brandt stung McGregor’s palms as Dortmund pursued swift salvation. It arrived after 31 minutes, Bellingham enjoying the break of the ball from Connor Goldson before beating McGregor with a calm, low finish. Rangers could rue the softness of the goal but had no legitimate argument that parity was not valid. Scott Arfield was denied by Kobel and Alfredo Morelos blasted the rebound against Matt Hummels. Arfield should, in truth, have squared to Kent. Such moments can define ties. McGregor produced a terrific diving save to deny Malen. Before a pulsating first-half closed, Dortmund edged in front on the night. Brandt was again involved, this time playing a ball into the six-yard area that was flicked beyond McGregor by the impressive Malen. Dortmund’s collective reaction demonstrated their belief that the last 16 was now a wholly legitimate aspiration. That Rangers switched to a back five during the interval suggested an acceptance that Dortmund would dominate the second period. Morelos, though, twice came close to extending the Rangers lead within 10 minutes of the restart. Tavernier prevailed where his teammate could not, with a fierce back-post finish after Hummels swiped at and only partly connected with a Calvin Bassey cross from Rangers’ left. Such dreadful defending had been a feature of Dortmund’s play a week earlier. The visitors’ situation was now desperate. Marco Reus stumbled having rounded McGregor, with the experienced forward due credit for not tumbling under a challenge from Leon Balogun that could have resulted in a spot-kick. Controversy did follow. Emre Can was extremely fortunate to win a free-kick, via VAR, after appearing to kick the ground before Morelos stole possession just inside the Dortmund half. Rangers had briefly celebrated a third, Morelos having marched down on goal before passing for Kent to tap home. They were denied that lead which appeared rather harsh on further viewing. Dortmund still needed two to force extra time. Their chances of scoring had been reduced by the lack of prominence enjoyed by Bellingham in the second period. Reus limped off in the closing minutes. Equally ominous for Dortmund was the recurring menace as shown by Rangers on the break. There was to be no further scoring; Ibrox euphoria depicted the historic, and perhaps unlikely, result.",Sport/Football,James Tavernier’s double for Rangers dumps Dortmund out of Europa League,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/24/rangers-borussia-dortmund-europa-league-play-off-second-leg-match-report
2/25/2022,"This could be the difference between fourth place and frustration. Arsenal looked on the verge of defeat here until Nicolas Pépé, with his first Premier League goal since May, equalised Hwang Hee-chan’s early effort and at that point consolidation of fifth spot hardly seemed the end of the world. It would prevent Wolves leapfrogging them, at least, but much better was to come. Deep into six minutes of injury time, Alexandre Lacazette was freed by slick interplay between Martin Ødegaard and Eddie Nketiah, dinking an effort towards goal. The shot was going wide but José Sá, the away keeper, deflected it in with his right glove and a wild set of celebrations underlined what this meant. Mikel Arteta had promised that their top-four pursuit would be a rollercoaster ride but it remains firmly in Arsenal’s hands. The horrendous events in Ukraine meant football felt of scant consequence in the buildup to this match but, in its specific context, the ramifications for the Champions League race would be significant. Arsenal had squeaked past Wolves at Molineux but the sides were only separated by two points at the outset here, even if the hosts had played a game more.  So Hwang’s opener ratcheted the tension skywards. Arsenal’s defensive security has been admirable in recent months, not least when holding out with 10 men against the same opponents almost a fortnight ago, but they were undone by an uncharacteristically shoddy error from Gabriel Magalhães. The centre-back had been the matchwinner in the previous encounter but here, guarding a long pass down the left as Raúl Jiménez gave chase, he was sloppy. An attempted backpass to Aaron Ramsdale was executed without enough purchase or, crucially, a look up. In nipped Hwang with the keeper stranded and his tightly-angled finish was made to look simple. Arsenal had already been warned when Romain Saïss diverted past Ramsdale and, having been flagged offside, saw the ensuing VAR review continue for longer than Arteta might have felt comfortable. Their defence was giving space up liberally and, in the 13th minute, Wolves should have gone two up. Jiménez was playing here for the first time since, in November 2020, he fractured his skull in a sickening clash of heads at the Clock End; having marauded with intent from the off he profited from a smart through pass from Daniel Podence, who had occupied a clever position on the inside right, but dragged wide when a goal seemed likely. Having shaken off these episodes, Arsenal did not play badly. A side less adept than Wolves at crowding, blocking and scrambling clear inside their own penalty area would have conceded before half-time. Jose Semedo had made a crucial challenge on Gabriel Martinelli inside the opening half-minute while, in a high-octane spell after the quarter-hour, Alexandre Lacazette screwed wide from a difficult angle and Saïss blocked brilliantly from Ødegaard. Max Kilman did even better to deny Lacazette in the 32nd minute after Kieran Tierney had capitalised on Sá’s misreading of a high ball, while Martinelli stabbed over shortly afterwards. Emile Smith Rowe’s illness meant Martinelli returned to the side after serving a one-game ban for being dismissed at Wolves’ home. His sending-off was among the recent calls that led Arteta to ask for a meeting with Professional Game Match Officials Limited, a request to which the referees’ body has agreed. The Emirates seethed with righteous indignation, a powerful tool when used well, at the merest hint of injustice here but there was little room for griping by the interval. Sá denied Martinelli but Wolves had not been outrageously lucky. The devilishly clever Podence released Hwang with a sumptuous reverse pass straight after the restart but, as the forward ran out of room, Ramsale diverted his shot agonisingly wide. It was another reminder for Arsenal that Wolves’ construction can be devastatingly precise. Arsenal’s became frayed. There was no doubting their workrate, as Lacazette showed when haring back to his own byline to dispossess Joao Moutinho, but Arteta’s discussions with his assistant Steve Round grew increasingly urgent. When they did create a reasonable opening, just before the hour, Lacazette spun onto Martinelli’s cross but was off target again. Lacazette, whose night was mixed until that last-gasp flourish, won a free-kick 22 yards out after a determined burst but subsequently wasted it. Wolves looked assured, not to mention happy to run down the clock when it suited, and were hardly under siege as the closing stages approached. Arteta foraged among an outwardly uninspiring set of substitute options and sought a turn from Pépé. Lacazette almost equalised, forcing Sa to parry, and a late storm seemed inevitable. Wolves looked capable of holding out, though, until the Ivorian struck. His finish was marvellous, turning and finishing in one movement after a cutback from another replacement, Nketiah. Chances came and went at either end in a frantic finish, Pedro Neto and Bukayo Saka coming close, but then arrived the kind of intervention that defines a season.",Sport/Football,Lacazette forces late Arsenal winner to complete comeback against Wolves,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/24/arsenal-wolves-premier-league-match-report
2/25/2022,"From his home in Key West, Florida, Billy Connolly describes what he used to get up to after a standup gig had finished. He would continue on into the night, and “find some tavern where people were happy to listen to a tale or two”. Billy Connolly Does ... (Gold) is just that: prodded by his long-time director Mike Reilly, he reminisces about the past, telling tales gathered together on a certain theme, illustrated by a pacy mix of animation, library clips and archive footage. Sometimes these hybrid compilation/interview shows work well – French and Saunders did a great one on women in comedy last year – and sometimes they feel like a long-expired rock band repackaging their greatest hits for the ninth time. Connolly is such a charmer that this one works beautifully. Subsequent episodes will cover fatherhood, marriage and home, but the theme tonight is bad behaviour, which shows off Connolly at his most raucous, and allows for a spot of profound reflection at the end.  Reilly explains that he has made this show because he has worked with Connolly for 10 years, and all anyone wants to know from him is: “What’s Billy Connolly like?” His answer? “He’s everything you want him to be.” Connolly retired from standup in 2018, having been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2013, but after 50 years of shows, there is plenty of material to look back on. What’s striking is how familiar much of it is, how woven into the fabric of British comedy culture his work has been. Bad behaviour is a great topic because it gives him free rein to cover all the naughty stuff. He talks about getting sidetracked by lesbian bus drivers in Wellington, New Zealand, and about the appeal of pubs and bars. He does his famous “drunk walks” bit, riffs about life on tour and the shenanigans that bored and overindulged people are likely to get up to. Being on tour is the whole world for people in the thick of it, although it’s usually of little interest to anyone who isn’t. Few can spin gold out of an environment that is notoriously monotonous; that Connolly is an exception to this rule just proves his greatness. The anecdotes are criminally entertaining, though I am not sure how necessary the animations are: just hearing him describe a trifle down the trousers is enough. Michael Parkinson recalls a wild night out with Connolly in Sydney, when the comedian appeared to be drunkenly goading police to arrest him, in the middle of the road. Parkinson says it was his job to get Connolly back to the hotel before he was locked up, but Connolly only agreed to go with him if they danced all the way back. “Billy in the wild days,” as Parkinson puts it, warmly, seemed like a limitless adventure. The wild days did not last, of course. His wife appears in this first episode via “Pam-Cam”, providing biscuits, and Connolly recalls the time she told him she did not want to be with a drunk, and so he stopped drinking. The discussion about that is almost a match for the peerless comedy clips from across the ages. “People don’t mind if you give up drinking so long as you buy your round,” he jokes, before offering up an honest consideration of the role alcohol played in his career. He was worried that without it, he would not be the man he was, but he reasons that in the end it is “pretendy wildness”, and that he knows how to turn it on, with or without the drink. Pretendy wildness, real wildness: all life is here, and it all amuses him greatly. Amid the nostalgia, there is time for reflection, and plenty of the memories are as moving as they are funny. Many of the people Connolly speaks of are now dead. He reminisces about a silly hotel game invented by his old soundman, Malcolm Kingsnorth, who spent 10 years on the road with Status Quo before moving to Connolly’s tour. The days of comedians as rock stars, so intertwined that they could share a stage together, as Connolly did with Led Zeppelin, are a relic of another age, but it’s fun to remember him as the first rock star comedian. He recalls a night out with John Hurt and Keith Moon, with whom he clicked instantly, and anticipated a long and fruitful friendship. But Moon died before they could meet again. “I was really looking forward to having him as a friend,” says Connolly, sadly, before letting us in on what he did for his own, small personal tribute. I’ll admit that I had a lump in my throat, but the real pleasure here, I think, is that Connolly had a twinkle in his eye.",Arts/Television & radio,Billy Connolly Does ... review – criminally entertaining yarns from the Big Yin,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/24/billy-connolly-does-review-criminally-entertaining-yarns-from-the-big-yin
2/25/2022,"Courtney Lawes has described the recent injury problems that left him with persistent headaches and affected vision caused by “headrush”, having been restored to the England captaincy for Saturday’s key Six Nations clash against Wales. Lawes has been cleared to make his first appearance in six weeks at Twickenham this weekend, having been sidelined with a head injury since Northampton’s European Cup defeat by Ulster on 16 January. After arriving into camp with England later that month Lawes had a scan and visited a specialist who identified that the problem was with his vestibular system, or in his own words, “the connection between your eyes, ears and neck”, which had been “rattled”.  Jones believes Lawes will hit the ground running against Wales, describing his captain as someone who “tends to play pretty well fresh on to the paddock” and the Northampton loose forward, renowned for his tough tackling, is adamant he has no concerns over jumping back in at the deep end. Lawes – who was cleared to return to full training last Friday – painted a candid picture of his symptoms over the past month and a half, however. “I guess pretty much the day after [the Ulster match] I had headaches which didn’t go away for a little while,” said the 33-year-old. “I also had headrush-like symptoms. It was explained to me that with the vestibular system you get headaches because the connection’s been rattled and your brain is having to compensate. Maybe your neck doesn’t think your head is in the position it is. “When your brain has to compensate for that you get things like headaches and trouble with the eyes, which is why I was getting headrush or those kinds of symptoms. It was all explained quite well so I knew exactly what was going on. It gave me a bit of peace of mind. It wasn’t in one particular game. I had just taken a couple of little knocks the past month or two or so. I was a little worried, obviously because it is to do with your head, but I came into camp and we got a scan and saw a specialist and he said it was nothing to do with my brain which was a massive relief. We have been going pretty hard this week [in training] and I have come through it fine, I am pretty confident.” England v Wales teams, 4.45pm GMT kick-off, Saturday 26 February England (TBC): Steward; Malins, Slade, ????, Nowell; Smith, Randall; Genge, Cowan-Dickie, Sinckler, Ewels, Itoje, Lawes (capt), Curry, Dombrandt. Replacements: George, Marler, Stuart, Isiekwe, Simmonds, Youngs, Ford, Daly. Wales: L Williams; Cuthbert, Watkin, Tompkins, Adams; Biggar (capt), T Williams; W Jones, Elias, Francis, Rowlands, Beard, Moriarty, Basham, Faletau. Replacements: Lake, G Thomas, Brown, S Davies, Morgan, Hardy, Anscombe, J Davies. Tom Curry captained England in the defeat by Scotland and the victory over Italy but Jones revealed it was always the plan to turn to Lawes once he had recovered. Lawes proved a popular captain for the autumn victories over Tonga and South Africa, with 90 caps he brings considerable experience to a game England must win if they are to keep alive any realistic hopes of winning the title, and a lightness of touch around the dressing room. Jones conceded that Ben Youngs was “not happy” to be named only on the bench as he prepares to break Jason Leonard’s all-time England caps record but Lawes believes the current England squad has a more compassionate side than in years gone by. Asked if that was the case, he said: “I’d say so, yeah, definitely. The motivation now is to play for each other and we really do have that nailed on now. We commit to everything we do in the week, we buy into each other and therefore we owe it to each other to turn up on the weekend. “Obviously [Ben] will be disappointed, he won’t show it. He’s still going to give everything he can to the team and that’s credit to himself and the team, because I would expect every one of the players to be disappointed, definitely, but to still contribute to the efforts at the weekend.”",Sport/Sport,Courtney Lawes ready to lead England against Wales after head injury all-clear,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/24/england-wales-rugby-union-six-nations-courtney-lawes
2/25/2022,"There would seem no immediate link, at first glance, between the quicksilver Harry Randall, England’s starting scrum-half against Wales, and Jack Leach, the bespectacled Somerset and England left-arm spinner. In the constantly whirring mind of Eddie Jones, though, a significant connection exists which is set to shape the outcome of Saturday’s pivotal Six Nations fixture at Twickenham. As an avid cricket fan Jones took his usual keen interest in the recent Ashes series, not least the calculated way in which Australia sought to hit Leach out of the attack early in the series at The Gabba. This week Jones has dug out those clips again to illustrate to his squad the importance of meticulous, smart preparation and the effect it can have on major sporting outcomes.  The point was less about Australia’s plethora of left-handers deliberately trying to dent Leach’s confidence – which they successfully achieved – and more the broader importance of having a plan in place at international level. “That didn’t happen by chance,” said Jones, having announced perhaps the best balanced England starting XV available to him. “That was a plan by the Australian team’s leadership to get Leach out of the attack. They didn’t want him in there and they wanted to make sure England’s four medium pacers had to keep bowling.” Which is a not dissimilar rationale to the one Jones has applied to his selection this week, prior to the hammer blow of Manu Tuilagi’s hamstring strain which has now ruled him out of contention. His analysis of Wales has reinforced his view of a team who are tough to put away in tight games, as shown by a series of close contests in recent times and again against Scotland in Cardiff last week. The Jones plan, therefore, is to rush out and grasp the early initiative via a combination of pace, power and purpose. Hence the choice of Randall ahead of Ben Youngs, who must now wait to overhaul Jason Leonard’s record as England’s most-capped player from the bench. Randall is nothing if not rapid and England’s second-half go-slow against Italy in Rome with Youngs on the pitch has also trumped any sentimental feelings. The layers of tactical nuance, though, do not end there. England are already well aware of Wales’s preference for keeping the ball infield against them rather than supplying them with plenty of lineout possession from which they so often build. The aerial skills of Dan Biggar and Liam Williams are further incentives to hoist the ball skywards and seek to compete, with a hard-working defence in support. Factor in Jones’s belief that the first 20 minutes are an increasingly prime time to attack in the modern game and the head coach believes supporters would be wise to take their seats early. “You generally find that, if you can get some good quality ball early, the defences are not as quickly set,” confirmed Jones. “The first 20 minutes of a Test match is always the quickest. I think the stat is that 78% of teams who score the first try win the Test, so it is really important for us to have a fast start. We have to get out of the blocks pretty quickly.” And if that fails, Jones also has Plan B waiting. Modern stats indicate a tendency for more lineouts to occur late in games, for which Jamie George’s throwing accuracy is perfectly suited. It leaves Luke Cowan-Dickie to roar from the start alongside the equally rumbustious Ellis Genge, with Joe Marler on hand to inject extra second-half scrummaging oomph if needed. Youngs, while disappointed not to be starting, is also no stranger to last-quarter pressure while Elliot Daly has been a late thorn in Welsh sides in the past. Much time and effort, furthermore, continues to be spent on enhancing England’s leadership depth, with Simon Scott, a former Royal Marines officer and corporate leadership consultant, and the former national captain Will Carling helping to improve both communication and the squad’s operational structure. The upshot, slightly counter-intuitively, is that England now boast no fewer than four official vice captains supporting Courtney Lawes – Tom Curry, Henry Slade, Genge and Cowan-Dickie – with the Owen Farrell-George Ford decision-making axis no longer holding the balance of power. Where precisely that will leave Farrell when he is back from injury remains an interesting question but the more collegiate approach encouraged by Scott appears to suit all concerned. “Simon brings a very modern perspective of leadership to help create an environment where the players can grow,” explained Jones. “He’s a corporate guy who loves his rugby. Communication is one thing [but] it’s about being intentional in your planning. Nothing ever happens unless you plan it.” On the aforementioned Scott’s website his personal mantra sounds simple enough: to help “ordinary people to achieve extraordinary performance over and over again through deliberate, rigorous, quality practice – and to stay cheerful, even in adversity”. England have endured a touch of the latter in this championship so far but, if they win well this weekend, their title destiny will still be very much in their own hands.
