3/2/2022,"By Andrew Hay and Rod Nickel (Reuters) - A Texas software developer and a cook in British Columbia are among dozens of Americans and Canadians answering Ukraine's call for foreign volunteers to fight Russia's invasion. With their governments refusing to send troops to Ukraine out of fear of sparking a world war, Americans and Canadians told Reuters they were inspired by Ukrainians' fierce resistance. Many believe their democratic rights at home may ultimately be jeopardized if they do nothing to defend Europe. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on Sunday for the formation of an ""international legion."" Some young volunteers traveled straight to Ukraine to enlist. Others were applying at Ukrainian embassies and consulates before quitting jobs or dropping out of university. The mobilization was taking place as Russian artillery bombarded Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, on Monday, the fifth day of conflict. ""I feel guilty to not go,"" said Dax, 26, a veteran of the elite U.S. Army 82nd Airborne infantry division, who planned to deploy with other former U.S. military personnel. Like many volunteers, the Alabama native declined to give his full name amid discussion on social media of the need to keep their identities and movements secret for security reasons. Canadian Bryson Woolsey quit his job as a cook on Sunday after seeing Zelensky's appeal. He has no military training and plans to buy a plane ticket to Poland, cross into Ukraine and volunteer for combat. ""I felt like I had to do something,"" said Woolsey, 33, of Powell River, British Columbia, who became restless as he watched images of wounded women and children in Ukraine. Canada's Foreign Minister Melanie Joly on Sunday told reporters it was up to individual Canadians to decide whether they wanted to join Ukraine's international brigade. A U.S. State Department spokesperson, in an email to Reuters, said U.S. citizens are urged not to travel to Ukraine. Not all volunteers want to fight. In Quebec, 35-year-old physician Julien Auger was preparing to leave his young family to become a medic with Ukraine's health ministry and provide ""neutral"" humanitarian aid. ""Global opinion and support is the key right now to solving the conflict,"" said Auger, a father of two who provides palliative care at a hospital in Saint-Jérôme. In online groups, military veterans warned volunteers who lacked combat training they were heading into a conflict where inexperience could be a liability for themselves and others. That did not stop those like Tai B., 23, who studied journalism in New York. ""I'm not looking to be a hero, or a martyr, I just want to finally do something right,"" said Tai, who can cook, do basic mechanics and knows how to handle a firearm. He said he has contacted Ukraine's U.S. Embassy staff about enlisting in Zelenskiy's ""international legion."" Hyde, a 28-year-old from the U.S. Midwest, said he was already in Kyiv and expected to start military training on Tuesday. ""I cannot bear the thought of Europe once again being plunged into warfare,"" said Hyde, who described himself as a gun enthusiast and avid survivalist with no combat experience. He expects to be given a helmet, body armor, knee pads and eventually a rifle. In Austin, Texas, a software developer said he would draw on his experience as a U.S. Army cadet to fight for Ukraine. ""If they're willing to defend democracy then I think those that benefit from a democratic society are duty-bound to support them,"" said the 25-year-old, who asked that his name not be used. ""I'm not telling my parents until I head to the airport.""

3/2/2022,"By Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Russia's military move on Kyiv has stalled as its forces struggle with basic logistics challenges, including shortages of food and fuel, with some units appearing to be gripped by low morale, a senior U.S. defense official said on Tuesday. Russia warned Kyiv residents to flee their homes on Tuesday and rained rockets down on Kharkiv, as Russian commanders who have failed to achieve a quick victory shifted their tactics to intensify the bombardment of Ukrainian cities. Satellite images taken on Monday show a Russian military convoy north of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv that stretches for about 40 miles (64 km), substantially longer than the 17 miles (27 km) reported earlier in the day. ""One reason why things appear to be stalled north of Kyiv is that the Russians themselves are regrouping and rethinking and trying to adjust to the challenges that they've had,"" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The official told reporters that it was unclear whether the convoy itself had stalled, but it was not making much progress. ""The Russians have been surprised by some of the morale problems that they're experiencing and I think they're none too pleased about the logistics and sustainment challenges they've had,"" the official said, without providing evidence. Still, Russian forces attacked a television tower in Ukraine's capital Kyiv, potentially disrupting its signal, Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said. As the invasion entered its sixth day, Russia had launched more than 400 missiles on Ukrainian targets so far but did not control any major cities or have complete control of the skies over Ukraine.

3/2/2022,"The Putin-backed president of Belarus has warned that World War III could be about to begin as he reportedly prepares his troops to assist with Russia’s mass-scale invasion of Ukraine. President Alexander Lukashenko warned that the crisis in Ukraine could spark a global conflict, writing in a statement: “Russia is being pushed towards a third world war. We should be very reserved and steer clear of it. Because nuclear war is the end of everything.” Despite the dire warning, the increasingly rogue leader—who allowed Russia to amass its military hardware and launch an attack from his side of the border—is expected to send troops into Ukraine, according to The Washington Post, citing an unnamed Biden administration official who said, “It’s very clear Minsk is now an extension of the Kremlin.” The threat of Belarus joining the invasion cast a shadow over Monday’s peace talks which began on the Belarus border town of Gobel shortly before 1 p.m. local time. The talks, which were not attended by Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky or Russian President Vladimir Putin, were assisted by Russian-Israeli billionaire Roman Abramovich, who owns Chelsea Football Club. Abramovich attended at the request of Ukraine, according to the Jerusalem Post, which cites his close ties to the Jewish communities in Russia and Ukraine, of which Zelensky is part. Ukraine’s first request was an immediate ceasefire, which was denied as bullets and missiles continued to rain down across the country, especially in Kharkiv, which came under heavy cluster bomb attacks Monday afternoon, according to CNN. On social media, several Western journalists posted images too gruesome to repost of an elderly woman whose devastating wounds that blew off her legs eventually proved fatal. Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei opened the session with a message meant to calm nerves. “Dear friends, the President of Belarus asked me to welcome you and to provide everything for your work, as agreed with President Zelensky and President Putin,” he said. “You may feel completely safe here. This is our sacred duty.” Lukashenko had called Zelensky on Sunday and offered to guarantee his safety if he should attend the peace summit on the Ukraine border with Belarus, saying he would take “responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on the Belarusian territory will remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation's travel, meeting and return.” Zelensky declined the offer, choosing instead to continue fighting off Russian troops in the capital city of Kyiv where heavy fighting seemed to calm down overnight with the Russian military opening a safe corridor for Ukrainian civilians to leave the capital city after the end of a weekend-long curfew. Instead, many lined up for food and other supplies to hunker down or stay to protect their city. Heavy fighting continued elsewhere, including the cities of Chernihiv and Kharkiv, which European and British defense ministries confirm is still under Ukrainian control despite heavy losses. Ukraine’s defense ministry confirmed Monday that dozens had been killed and hundreds injured after brutal Russian firepower. Russian forces have instead reportedly secured the Black Sea city of Berdyansk and the city of Kherson near Crimea. NATO head Jens Stoltenberg tweeted on Monday that NATO partners are “providing Ukraine with air-defense missiles and anti-tank weapons.” In Mariupol, which has seen some of the deadliest fighting, a 6-year-old girl in unicorn pajamas died after being hit by Russian firepower. The doctor who tried to save her told an Associated Press crew, “Show this to Putin. The eyes of this child, and crying doctors.” Ukraine’s defense ministry was also bolstered by intense interest in its “International Legion” of foreign fighters. After putting out a call over the weekend for any foreign nationals to join the fight to protect Ukraine, the ministry said it received “thousands” of messages from people who wished to help. The Russian military has been hit with a series of setbacks, even admitting they had suffered casualties against the scrappier and smaller Ukrainian military for the first time. “The Russian occupiers have reduced the pace of the offensive, but are still trying to develop success in some areas in the offensive against Ukraine,” Ukraine’s Cabinet of Ministers posted on Twitter Monday. In recent days, Russians have had to resort to drawing on their fuel and logistics supplies “earlier” than U.S. officials think they planned to, because of Ukrainian resistance the official said. In their own version of events, Russia claimed control over Ukraine's airspace. “Russian aviation has gained air supremacy over the entire territory of Ukraine,” Russian Ministry of Defense spokesman Igor Konashenkov said in a statement. The senior defense official pushed back on that idea, telling reporters Monday that airspace is still contested in Ukraine. The Russians also haven’t successfully taken the cities of Kharkiv or Mariupol, the official said, adding that Ukrainians are putting up “stiff and determined resistance” in those cities. There are not yet indications Belarus forces are in Ukraine, the senior U.S. defense official said Monday. As the fighting rages, over 400,000 Ukrainians—mostly women and children—have left the country with many crossing into Poland. Men between the ages of 18 and 60 are prohibited from leaving the country. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox. Sign up now.

3/2/2022,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — A U.S. Senate candidate for Missouri says she has no plans to delete a transphobic tweet that violated Twitter's rules against hateful conduct, even after the social media platform said she won’t be able to tweet, retweet, follow or like posts until she does. Twitter suspended Vicky Hartzler ’s personal account on Monday. Hartzler's tweet, posted in mid-February, said: ""Women’s sports are for women, not men pretending to be women,” and included her TV ad targeting transgender people in sports and particularly University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas. A statement from Hartzler's campaign called the suspension “shameful, utterly ridiculous, and a horrible abuse of censorship by big tech giants to stifle free speech.” The campaign said Hartzler will not delete the tweet. Hartzler is a congresswoman representing Missouri's 4th District. She is among several Republicans vying for the 2022 Senate seat.

3/2/2022,"Retired televangelist Pat Robertson resurfaced this week to make another in a long line of his doomsday predictions. This time, he returned to his “700 Club” show to claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin was being compelled by God to not only attack Ukraine, but use the country as a staging ground for a war against Israel to fulfill biblical prophecy: Robertson, who turns 92 this month, is a serial doomsday cheerleader. In the 1970s, he predicted a 1982 ending. In the 1990s, he predicted a 2007 ending. In 2020, he predicted Donald Trump would win reelection ― “without question” ― and it would lead to the end. (In that case, it wasn’t a war that would end the world, as he is currently predicting, but something a lot more natural, like an asteroid.) “It’s sudden destruction. It’s not going to be some nuclear war,” Robertson said, per USA Today. “We’re not going to be allowed to blow this earth up.” He also has a long history of hateful, divisive, racist and intolerant comments.

3/2/2022,"A senior US official said Ukraine's airspace remains contested, contradicting Moscow's claims. Russia was expected to swiftly knock out Ukraine's air defense capabilities, but that has not happened. Ukraine has claimed to have shot down Russian fighter jets, helicopters, and even troop transport planes. Despite Russian claims to the contrary, Ukraine's airspace remains contested as the country's forces fight to repel Russian aggression, a senior US defense official said on Monday during an off-camera press briefing. ""The Russians have not achieved air superiority over the whole country,"" the official told reporters. ""Ukrainian air defenses remain intact and viable in terms of aircraft and missile defense systems, and they're engaged."" ""It's a contested airspace, and it's a very dynamic airspace,"" the official continued, contradicting Moscow's claims this morning that Russia has ""total air superiority"" over Ukraine. It has been five days since Russia launched a large-scale attack on Ukraine, attacking the country from several directions and pushing towards Kyiv, the capital city. Russian forces have conducted bombardments of positions in and around Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, forcing numerous civilians to take shelter in basements and metro stations. One video uploaded to Twitter on Monday shows incoming and outgoing fire over Kyiv, which appears consistent with an engagement between aviation assets and air-defense systems. —Michael Kofman (@KofmanMichael) February 28, 2022 Another video posted on social media Monday appeared to show surface-to-air missiles targeting air assets, purportedly over Kyiv. —Christopher Miller (@ChristopherJM) February 28, 2022 In recent days, Ukraine has claimed to have shot down fighters, helicopters, and even transport planes. Early in the fighting against Russia, for instance, Ukraine's armed forces said that they had downed five Russian aircraft and a helicopter, CNN reported, but the Russian military denied these claims. Russia only recently acknowledged taking losses in the conflict with Ukraine, but it insists that Ukrainian losses are significantly worse than its own. A video that was released by Ukraine's military last Thursday seemed to show one helicopter being shot down over Hostomel, a town on the outskirts of Kyiv, and Ukraine's Armed Forces posted a video of what was said to be a damaged Russian helicopter in that area. —ВОЇНИ УКРАЇНИ🇺🇦 (@ArmedForcesUkr) February 24, 2022 Ukraine's top general Valeriy Zaluzhiny claimed Friday that the country's armed forces shot down a Russian Ilyushin Il-76 plane near Kyiv, the Kyiv Independent reported. The Il-76 is mainly used for heavy transport and paratrooper operations and could carry up to 150 soldiers, according to the Kyiv Independent. The Ukrainian military, according to The War Zone, also said it shot down a helicopter and a Su-25 close-air support aircraft with an S-300 missile system. Russia was expected to quickly eliminate Ukraine's air defense capabilities earlier in the conflict, but so far that does not appear to have happened.
