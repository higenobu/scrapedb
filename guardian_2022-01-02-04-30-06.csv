1/2/2022,"After unveiling a new stand here Exeter showed the good and bad of their game before holding on for their third home league win of the season.  First-half tries from the wing Tom O’Flaherty and lock Jonny Hill and almost total dominance of possession gave Exeter a 12-3 lead with 10 minutes left but it should have been double that. Then the game was turned on its head when the Bristol replacement Henry Purdy intercepted Joe Simmonds’s pass on the halfway line and went in under the posts. Bristol could hardly believe their luck – they had hardly landed a punch were still in with a chance. Exeter had not scored since Hill’s effort on 31 minutes but set up camp on the Bristol line and Joe Simmonds’s next long pass found its target, Stuart Hogg scooting over to settle it. Exeter played with an intensity and zip that has not always been evident this season and may just have turned the corner with the Premiership season approaching the halfway point. Frustratingly, they lost a bit of that in the second half and were not able to put the game to bed until Hogg’s score. They denied Bristol possession and Pat Lam’s crew look a shadow of the side who topped the table in the regular campaign last season before imploding in the semi-final against Harlequins. They lost their full-back, Charles Piutau, after 24 minutes to injury, making them reshuffle the back three and at the end they had hooker Harry Thacker on the wing. The Bristol lineout did not function again and for the home side Hogg and Henry Slade purred while Hill showed how much he will be missed when he moves to Sale next season. The East Stand is not quite finished but it was open for business as Sandy Park hosted its record crowd. Once it is completed capacity will be about 16,000 and the attendance of 14,100 beats even 2015 World Cup matches. The team have looked in need of some renovation of their own with their patchy form, which left them in a clutch of teams clinging on to Leicester’s coattails. They had Christmas week off but before that they were comfortably second-best to Glasgow in a 22-7 Champions Cup defeat. Bristol had barely got over their indigestion on Boxing Day when Leicester beat them 28-26 with an injury-time try. That was their third league defeat on the spin and they were without a league victory since 6 November. The honour of scoring the first try in the shadow of the new stand fell to O’Flaherty but it was made by his opposite wing, Jack Nowell. Nowell came off his flank, after Hill had won a lineout, and popped up in midfield for the ball before kicking it through to the 22. Hogg picked up without breaking stride and he put O’Flaherty over. On half-hour Exeter went back to type for their second try with Hill taking two tacklers with him over the line after drives from Dave Ewers and Sam Simmonds. It was only 12-3 but it seemed like a chasm with Exeter having more than three-quarters of the ball in the first period. When Bristol did make it into the opposition 22, after 50 minutes, Exeter kept them out and Nowell turned the ball over on his own tryline to frustrate the visitors even more. Slade then dived in for an interception on the Bristol line leaving the Bears centre Semi Radradra free to rush up field in another glimmer of hope for before the move broke down when the Fijian ignored his support runners. Purdy opened the possibility of an away win before Hogg slammed the door shut. Bath’s Premiership match at London Irish tomorrow has been called off after the club returned more Covid positive test results. It follows the scrapping of Bath’s Premiership Rugby Cup tie against Exeter on Wednesday after a number of players were ruled out. A Premiership Rugby spokesperson said: ""Our priority is the health and safety of everyone involved with Bath Rugby and London Irish so the decision has been made to cancel the match. We will give the clubs any support they need and wish everyone affected a full and speedy recovery. Neither Premiership Rugby nor the club will be naming any of the players or staff involved and we'd ask everyone to respect their privacy."" PA Media",Sport/Sport,Stuart Hogg’s late try helps Exeter recover from Bristol fightback,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/01/exeter-bristol-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
1/2/2022,"Popping a beautifying filter on the TikTok video she was filming seemed harmless to Mia. It made it look as though she had done her makeup, took away the hint of a double chin that always bothered her, and gently altered her bone structure to make her just that bit closer to perfect. After a while, using filters on videos became second nature – until she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror one day and realised, to her horror, she no longer recognised her own face.  “I just felt so ugly … It’s a very scary moment,” she says. “When you’ve got that filter up all the time … you almost disassociate from that image in the mirror because you have this expectation that you should look like that. Then when you don’t, the self-destructive thoughts start. It’s quite vile the way that you then perceive yourself.” Live, augmented reality filters on photo- and video-based social media platforms including TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat aren’t new but they have evolved from silly hats, puppy dog ears and comically enlarged features to more subtle beautifying effects that may not be immediately obvious to other users. As well as adding makeup, many of the popular filters that have crept into app libraries also change the face’s proportions, generally to fit female, European beauty standards, with thinner faces, smaller noses and plump lips. Mia, who asked for her real name to not be used, says she started using filters when one of her TikTok videos unexpectedly went viral and her audience suddenly skyrocketed. “I’m a bigger girl,” she says. “At that point, I was around 100kg, so it was really scary for me to have people looking at me.” As her video clocked up more than 1m views, abusive comments started pouring in. “I was getting a lot of hate,” she says, adding: “The filters on TikTok are so smooth and flawless – they don’t always look like a filter. So it felt so easier to use them, just to make me feel a little bit better … but honestly, it doesn’t even look like me. “I was in bed crying some nights about how ugly and disgusting I felt. I’m almost 30! I shouldn’t feel that way … Imagine a 10-year-old using these filters. That’s scary to me.” There isn’t yet a full body of research on the psychological effects of these filters but Dr Jasmine Fardouly, a body image expert from the University of New South Wales, says a study she conducted last year suggests the more unattainable the beauty standard that young people are exposed to online, the more harmful it can be … “It’s promoting a beauty ideal that’s not attainable for you,” she says. “It’s not attainable for anyone, really, because nobody looks like that. Everybody’s faces are being made to look the exact same way. “The fact that it’s harder to know that it’s a filter may potentially be worse for the promoting of those ideals.” When filters are used through TikTok, Instagram or Snapchat’s in-app software, a small label with the filter name appears on the video. While the introduction of these disclaimers, both in traditional and social media, has been a key focus of policymakers, Fardouly says the research so far doesn’t suggest they work. “The research suggests that unless you show people the actual real version of that person’s appearance, it doesn’t seem to make a difference.” There’s a strong relationship between negative body image and the use of photo editing but Fardouly says it’s less clear which direction this correlation flows; whether people’s self-esteem is lower due to the constant augmentation of their images or if those with low body images are more likely to use these features in the first place. “Body dissatisfaction is an important predictor for eating disorders, and is a predictor for depression and low self-esteem … There is also a link to increased interest in cosmetic surgery.” This is something Amy Hall-Hanson has experienced first hand. The 29-year-old has struggled with body dysmorphia for many years but says she never fixated on her lips until she started using beautifying filters for every Snapchat and Instagram photo she took. “There are a few filters that make my lips look really nice … and it actually made me want to get them done,” she says. “I’ve even played around with overdrawing my lips, and then I’ve stopped myself and gone, ‘Why am I doing this? Like, I’ve never had a problem with my lips before in photos … “I would look in the mirror and my lips would look so much thinner than they probably were in real life … I’ve had to take a little bit of a break from taking photos of myself just to put that buffer in place.” Fardouly says there are no simple solutions – but there are things that social media platforms can do to mitigate potential harm. “I think that the algorithms could be updated to make it so more diversity is being recommended and shown to people,” she says. “The ease [with] which people can use filters [is a problem]. Especially if they’re changing the structure of the face and promoting these unattainable beauty ideals, then it would be helpful to remove those filters from the platforms.” Instagram and its parent company Meta, formerly known as Facebook, have made some moves to limit the use of what they call “face-altering” effects. While their open-source filter creation tool, Spark AR, does allow effects that alter face shape to be uploaded, they will not appear in the “Effects Gallery”, which displays the top effects on the app at that time. Filters that add makeup or smooth skin are discoverable there, and users are still able to use the search function to find face-altering effects. “Effects that directly promote cosmetic surgery are not allowed on Instagram,” a Facebook spokesman says. “We want AR effects to be a positive and safe experience for our community, and we have guidelines for creating and publishing effects using Spark AR. We recognise that creators predominantly use face alteration and feature augmentation to share artistic, playful and fantasy effects, and these effects are a creative way for our community to express themselves.” Snapchat does not have specific restrictions on face altering or beautifying filters submitted by users through the platform’s “Lens Lab” but a spokesperson for the company says the app’s focus on private, rather than public, communication sets it apart from other social media. “[Snapchat] was created at a time where everyone was curating a ‘perfect’ image of themselves online. Snapchat … is private by default to create an environment where people feel free to authentically be themselves.” The spokesperson says Snapchat has “invested in an in-house sociologist who is tasked with thinking about the impact our product and features have on our community”. “When someone sends a snap with a lens to someone else on Snapchat, the recipient is always shown which lens it is.” TikTok doesn’t allowed users to submit their own augmented reality effects; they are created by the company. The ethics of a number of their beautifying filters, including “faux freckles” or “glow”, have been the subject of intense debate among users. TikTok declined Guardian Australia’s request for comment. Fardouly says social media companies should not be held solely responsible for the harm caused by unattainable beauty standards. “It’s kind of human nature … A lot of the problems with the platforms come from people’s desires and motivations offline as well. People have always wanted to present themselves positively to others, that’s not new. “It’s just that social media really gives us the tools to control how we appear, and to really spend a lot of time investing in our self-presentation – and that’s where the harm can come from.” For Mia, it came to a head when she was riding in the car with a friend and mentioned that she was considering fat-dissolving injections to try to get rid of her now practically invisible double chin. “He looked at me like I was a crazy person,” she says. “He was like, ‘What are you talking about? You don’t have a double chin.’” After staring at her eerily unfamiliar, imperfect face in the mirror, it occurred to Mia that she was no longer living up to the message she was using TikTok to send in the first place. “Part of my content was about how we should really embrace who we are and what we look like,” she says. “But one day I kind of realised all of that content was a lie and was going to remain a lie as long as I was using filters. “I just woke up one day and went, ‘No, if I’m posting content any more, I’m not posting with filters.’ And I haven’t.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Is that really me?

1/2/2022,"It’s been more than 10 years since Alex Gaffey’s family home was used as a set for the movie Animal Kingdom, but the house still bears the evidence. “There was a scene that got cut from the film where someone was hacked up by a chainsaw in the bathroom,” Gaffey says. “So there was blood splatter everywhere. And because it was this grey Besser brick, the red food dye and tofu chunks were stuck in the wall.”  “I remember after the film was done, the art directors and assistants were scrubbing it out with toothbrushes and stuff. There’s still a few little spots left where we’re just like ‘oh, that’s Animal Kingdom’.” Gaffey was a teenager when his Melbourne home became the main set for the grizzly 2010 crime drama, recruited after a location scout dropped a note in their letterbox. A cast and crew of around 70 spent a month there filming, shooting death scenes while the Gaffey family lived around the happy chaos. The shoot temporarily transformed the home – and the lives of the Gaffeys. Their furniture was removed and replaced by items sourced by the art department. To prevent continuity errors, the batteries in their clocks were taken out and any props – giant bongs on coffee tables included – had to be left exactly where they were. When the crew shot at night, the family were put up at hotels. For their trouble, the Gaffeys were paid about $1,000 a week – a relatively small sum as the shoot was on a tight budget. They didn’t mind. “It was awesome,” Gaffey recalls. He remembers running home from school each day, excited to see what they were filming that afternoon – and even snagging work experience on the set. One of his jobs was to run traffic cones outside early each morning, blocking off space for the crew to park their trucks. The Gaffey family aren’t alone: many Australians loan out their properties to big productions. The reason real homes appeal to film and TV crews is simple: “Finding a house that meets the brief is quicker than constructing a set in a studio,” says location scout James Doherty. Animal Kingdom went on to win an Academy Award nomination and sweep Australia’s AACTA awards. But not every local production is destined for such acclaim – in the mid-2000s, the video version of self-help book The Secret was filmed at the Melbourne family home of then-teenager Tom Pitney. He remembers the windows of their Deepdene home being blacked out, big lights being positioned “everywhere” and hordes of crew members running around. Doors were taken off hinges and fake walls constructed to make rooms look smaller. As it was for the Gaffey family, their furniture was taken out and replaced. It was an exciting swarm of activity that, miraculously, left no trace. “When they were there, the whole house was trashed,” Pitney says. “And when they left, it was like they were never there.” And for a growing teenage boy, there were other perks: “Being a young kid, the best thing was just the fact that they had catering. So we raided all the food.” Their home’s appearance in The Secret led to it being used for a big-brand commercial and a Foxtel series called Satisfaction, which followed the lives of sex workers in a Melbourne brothel. Pitney has somewhat uncomfortable memories of the latter. “I was probably mid-puberty and came home after school with Mum and my little brother and they were filming sex scenes on our kitchen bench, which was so awkward,” he says. “They had sex in the laundry too.” Some people invite sex scenes – real ones – to be filmed in their property. In 2010, an all-female pornography company worked its way through Canberra share-houses. This writer was one of those who volunteered their home as a set. “All of our friends were having porn filmed in their house and you got a fee for referring someone else, so it just kind of spread,” my then-housemate Claire recalls. Our end of the deal was to vacuum, tidy up, leave and not return home until the shoot was over. In return we received $300 a day – a big payday for broke university students. “It was riches – so much money for literally just being out of the house for a day,” Claire says. “When I came back some things were in different spots, which was very disconcerting. A bunch of stuff on my desk was kind of moved around – my Post-it notes and my pens were in different spots. So I guess they’d done some desk stuff.” Despite the suspiciously rearranged stationary, Claire didn’t have major qualms about the shoot. “It was an all-female production company, so it wasn’t like there was going to be semen in places. I felt like that is really what made it OK.” For more family-friendly productions, sticking around to watch the shoot can even snag occupants a last-minute role. Cecile Owen had a scene from the Foxtel series Mr Inbetween filmed at her home in the Sydney suburb of Concord – “pure luck” , she says, that followed a letter drop in her street looking for locations. The scene in question featured the show’s central character, hitman Ray Shoesmith, going to visit the home of a man who wanted his pregnant mistress killed. “Because we have three children, we had scooters and toys all through the backyard,” Owen says. “[The producers] explained what the plot was and said: ‘We’re just going to get rid of everything.’ But then, as a joke, my husband said: ‘Wouldn’t it be funnier if the happily married man actually has kids?’ Because it makes the plot even worse: that he wants to get rid of the mistress and her baby when he has kids already.” “Next thing we know the producers were like: ‘Ah, we’ve got a big favour to ask. Do you think we could borrow your kids? Because we hadn’t thought of that and actually it would be good if we had children in the background while they’re talking in the garden.’” In addition to the $1,000 a day Owen received for the shoot, the kids each got $50 for five minutes of work. The Gaffey family ended up appearing as extras in a supermarket scene and their dog, Titian, snagged a role over the “professional dog” the crew was going to pay to bring in. Actor Ben Mendelsohn, who played Pope in the film, took a particular shine to Titian. “He loved our dog and claimed ownership of it,” Gaffey says. He’d be like: ‘No one’s allowed to feed her but me. Her and I are on a pure bacon diet.’” Mendelsohn was a “character”, Gaffey says. “He was definitely the craziest of them all, in the best possible way. He had no filter and was so down to earth. He would hang out with us all the time and bring us food from the catering cart. He’d be like: ‘How was ya fuckin’ day, mate? What’s going on? What are the teachers telling you?’ Then he’d just talk at you.” The Gaffeys’ Ivanhoe East home – a distinctive, mid-century house designed by architect Guilford Bell – became an important part of the film. “[Director] David Michôd wanted to treat the house like a character,” Gaffey says. “It was this grey backdrop, rather than your standard white walls, so it had an energy that matched the dark family that lived there.” Months later, getting to see their home on screen was part of the fun. “It was pretty surreal,” Gaffey says. “Now we have an Animal Kingdom poster up at home.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,My house was a film set: ‘They were filming sex scenes on our kitchen bench’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/02/my-house-was-a-film-set-they-were-filming-sex-scenes-on-our-kitchen-bench
1/2/2022,"There’s a reason surfers like to keep their best breaks a secret. For decades, wave riders have blazed a trail into little-known coastal towns – and in their wake come the planners and developers.  When Clint Bryan bought his house 40 minutes north of Perth city, one consideration was paramount: it had to be near his favourite surf break. And sure enough, his Kallaroo home is just five minutes’ walk from the Indian Ocean. The suburb name is a Noongar word meaning “road to the water”. But by the end of this summer, the waves that Bryan built his life around will disappear as the beach is redeveloped for the $252m Ocean Reef Marina. The marina is within the Marmion marine park and will transform 1.5km of coastline into shops, restaurants, boat moorings, a protected beach and new homes. The local state MP, Emily Hamilton, says it will create “thousands of jobs” and inject $3bn into the Western Australia economy. But it will also kill three surf breaks – Mossies, Big Rock and Pylons. The community group Save Ocean Reef says it will mount a legal challenge to the project because it is damaging the marine park, and a petition to construct an artificial reef has grown to nearly 2,500 signatures. Ocean Reef has been a surf destination since at least the 1950s, when it was little more than sand dunes and beach shacks, with just a caravan park nearby. “It’s like we are losing our playing field and the grassroots waves we learned to surf on,” says Bryan, a 43-year-old aviation rescue firefighter. “It’s the end of an era and our group [Ocean Reef Artificial Reef] just wants the opportunity to keep the surf community alive in our area.” Sean Doherty, the chair of the advocacy group Surf Rider Foundation, says dozens of surf breaks around the country are at risk from development or sand dune work. “The pressure on the coastline is growing,” Doherty says. “For every surf break that is in some kind of danger, it is the result of some development nearby and it takes different forms.” In some places the developments are similar to those proposed for Ocean Reef. On 1 May almost 700 surfers paddled out to protest against the development of eco-cabins, a conference centre and a restaurant on crown land near a surf spot called the Farm in Killalea, south of Wollongong. Opponents say the state-funded development will impinge on a national surfing reserve that was declared in 2009, although the proponents of the development insist it will affect less than 2% of the reserve. But Doherty says the most endangered breaks now are Narrabeen and South Narrabeen on Sydney’s northern beaches, where construction has begun on a 7m-high 1.3km concrete seawall to save 49 properties, a club and a car park built right on the beach. While the seawall will protect homes from erosion and storm surge, it will also affect the flow of sand. For waves to form, the movement of sand, which helps shape the seabed, is crucial. Waves break when there is a reef or an accumulation of sand under the water, making it shallow enough for the incoming swell to rise up and form waves. In a natural system, sand blows in and out to sea or is brought in by ocean currents. But Doherty says sea walls, houses and vegetation are increasingly anchoring sand to the shore, taking away the lifeblood of waves. “The magic qualities that make a good surf break are quite ephemeral and quite easily disturbed and changed, often as a result of development,” Doherty says. The foundation says other breaks are also threatened by proposals for seawalls, including at Wamberal on the NSW Central Coast and Byron Bay, nine hours north, where locals have been fighting the suggestion for years. Last year, authorities were forced to install emergency sandbagging and close Main and Clarkes beaches at Byron, where erosion caused by natural processes, development on frontal dune systems and changing weather patterns have wreaked havoc. Further threats to surf breaks in NSW, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia come from climate change, overcrowding and water pollution, the foundation says. In 2010, New Zealand became one of only two countries in the world to legally protect surf breaks (Peru is the other). In Australia, neither state nor federal environment legislation protects waves. Ana Manero, an environmental economist at the Australian National University who researches surfing economics, says the legal gap is a “massive blind spot”, but legislation is not the only way to defend surf breaks. “We don’t have environmental laws to protect surfing resources in Australia, but we have an economic argument,” Manero says. “Surfing brings a wealth of benefits, it makes places more desirable to live in, it is good for the local community, so the question is: when waves are impacted, how is that loss of value going to be accounted for?” There are an estimated 2.5 million recreational surfers in Australia and surf tourism expenditure was estimated to be about $91bn a year globally before the pandemic. “It’s crucial we understand the real value of surfing before we lose the many benefits it brings, not only for Australia’s surfing community but also for the hundreds of coastal towns where surfing underpins the local economy and lifestyle,” Manero says. For decades, environmental economics has been applied to quantify the value of recreation activities, such as scuba diving and fishing. Manero hopes surfing research will help inform better decisions when developments affect waves. “The problem for policymakers is that surfing’s ‘intangible’ benefits – such as mental health or social connections – are much harder to measure than jobs and retail sales – but I can tell you that they translate into millions of dollars,” she says. Manero says protecting waves does not mean leaving beaches untouched – there are many examples where the building of groynes, piers or sand dredging have improved the quality of waves. At Snapper Rocks on the Gold Coast, a “superbank” was unexpectedly formed after work to remove sand from the entrance to the Tweed River. “During the planning process, if we could put a little bit of brain power into understanding how waves form and the benefits they bring, then we would have a better chance of improving the wellbeing of coastal communities,” Manero says. “It is difficult, but it can be done.”",Sport/Sport,Wave goodbye: the battle to protect Australia’s surf breaks,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/02/wave-goodbye-the-battle-to-protect-australias-surf-breaks

Director Mattson Tomlin dusts off an old genre that has had some memorable recalibrations recently, such as Ex Machina, I Am Mother, Blade Runner 2049 and the Westworld reboot. Chloë Grace Moretz plays Georgia, who discovers she is pregnant on Christmas Eve. Soon androids (which in this future are modelled to look like humans) start raising hell, prompting her to embark on a perilous journey to a safe place in Boston where she can give birth.

It’s probably best not to expect a masterpiece, as the found footage genre is only occasionally interesting: for every Cannibal Holocaust, The Blair Witch Project or Chronicle, there are a zillion forgettable low-rent productions.

Irish actor Jamie Dornan (AKA Christian Grey from the Fifty Shades franchise) gets plonked in the middle of heat-frazzled Woop Woop, playing “The Man” – an antihero who suffers severe amnesia after being rammed off the road by a psychopathic truck driver. Why are the locals so … mean? And what did he do to deserve such rudeness? All will eventually be revealed after many a twist and turn. Directors Chris Sweeney and Daniel Nettheim establish a foot-to-the-pedal pace that doesn’t let up across the show’s six-episode arc.

Directed by actor Anthony Hayes, who made the very good 2008 Adelaide-set drama Ten Empty, Gold is a survival thriller about a man (Efron) who discovers a big chunk of the good stuff and, of course, executes a plan to keep it. Any outdoors-set film about greedy hard-bitten men pursuing wealth at the potential expense of life, limb and sanity is inevitably compared with The Treasure of the Sierra Madre – which is a little unfair given John Huston’s 1948 film is a rolled-gold (so to speak) masterpiece.

It’s hard to imagine a more fitting scene to summarise Gunn’s approach to caped crusader stories – his party-loving vibes making them feel like fun soirees (see also: Guardians of the Galaxy, The Suicide Squad and the underrated Super). Peacemaker continues where The Suicide Squad finished, even beginning with a “previously on The Suicide Squad” recap. This will limit the show’s broader appeal while satisfying fans of that film in particular. The series fleshes out the hero’s backstory and subsequent adventures, which involve him arguing with random people, evading assassination attempts and hanging out with his pet eagle.

The doco gets a tournament movie-esque trajectory when Wesley Enoch, artistic director of Sydney festival, invites Dean Widders and others to perform their soon-to-be-invented dance on a world stage, leaving no doubt as to what the final moments of Araatika will be. It is a film that’s softly uplifting and told with a warming sense of optimism. Film, France, 1991 – out 1 January French directors Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro (AKA Jeunet and Caro) made some amazing films – among them 1995’s The City of Lost Children and also the spectacularly weird and gnarly Delicatessen, a black comedy revolving around a butcher who murders humans then sells them as cheap meat. Grim subject, maybe, but it’s a visual delight from start to finish; if you don’t believe me, check out its innovative opening credits.

Film, US, 2015 – out 7 January Adam McKay’s latest satire, Don’t Look Up, has divided audiences and critics, some seeing it as an unmitigated disaster while others appreciate it as a thinly veiled commentary on the climate crisis. His GFC-themed comedy The Big Short was, for what it’s worth, more lauded and less divisive, celebrated as a fine example of making an accessible film out of dry and potentially uninteresting subject matter. A huge cast – including Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, Melissa Leo, Marisa Tomei, Margot Robbie and Christian Bale – help the medicine go down. Steve Carell delivers one of several memorable analogies when he describes mortgage bonds as “dog shit wrapped in cat shit”. Film, US, 2009 – out 7 January Like Adam McKay, Wes Anderson is a big-name director with a new film that has recently hit screens: the charming but slight The French Dispatch. The highly distinctive auteur’s style is even more fastidious in animation than live action, evidenced in his irresistible stop-motion adaptation of Roald Dahl’s famous children’s novel. Fantastic Mr Fox follows the suave titular character (voiced by George Clooney) as he steals produce from his human farmers then deals with the fallout.

1/2/2022,"As clouds roll overhead, a salty mist lies low over the timid waves of Manly’s Shelly Beach. Despite grey skies, the protected stretch of sand in Sydney’s northern beaches thrums with locals. “This area is an aquatic reserve,” Damien McClellan, founder of tourism company EcoTreasures, tells our tour group. “If you look behind you, you’ll see sandstone cliffs.”  McClellan points across the water to jutting, weathered rock faces, with layered, tan ridges. “Sydney’s sandstone coast is beautiful,” he says. I nod along with the tour group in agreement. We are standing at the headland, looking over bays and beaches lining the coast of Sydney’s north. Cabbage Tree Bay is closest. Sheltered by its reef and rocky geography, the bay does not get pummelled by surf, making it perfect for a snorkel or dive. It is where our tour group is heading for a guided lesson in the former. First, we struggle into wetsuits. Then we learn how to enter the water. “You’re going to look over your shoulder and walk backwards down the ramp,” McClellan tells us. “Then dunk yourself under.” It is my first time snorkelling. The water has been made murky by recent rains, and I’m nervous about lots of things, including (but not limited to) the possibility of mysterious creatures lurking deep, out of sight. We are fitted with flippers, goggles, and wetsuits. We are also given pool noodles to help keep ourselves afloat, so our flippers don’t disrupt any life on the sea floor. McClellan says, when fitting snorkelling goggles to your face, to press down until you feel a “suction” around the eyes. He also says to position the strap on the crown of your head, to ensure the goggles are secure enough for no saltwater to get in. But before fitting the goggles to your face, McClellan suggests rubbing a bit of baby shampoo to the lenses and then rinsing with water. This helps prevent your goggles fogging up while you swim. McClellan asks me: “Have you ever looked under the water before? How long did you look for? What did you see?” My answers: Yes (eyes closed, without goggles). Not for long. Not much. “Well, that’s just it,” he laughs. McClellan tells me that “too often”, people forget to pause, breathe, and simply “look” when in the water. “With snorkelling, you never know what you’re going to see,” he says. “And part of it is relaxing.” He explains that many people snorkel “for the disconnection”. As you focus on your breathing while underwater, you slow down. “When you do that, you see the most amazing stuff.” He is right. With your head and body submerged, all sounds are muted. We float across a sea meadow of thick, flowing kelp and algae which lines the left of the reserve. Translucent blobs called jimble float by. Earlier, a stranger in the change rooms told me to “not worry about those,” because “they won’t sting you”. Big, friendly groupers swim up to our faces and schools of small fish jet past, getting lost in the seagrass. Even on low visibility days like this, if you stay still and let yourself sway with the water long enough, you catch glimpses of purple rock beneath the kelp, unmoving on the seafloor. Once I’m accustomed to the water, my goggles and flippers feel less awkward, breathing through a snorkel becomes less laboured, and swimming comes with ease. McClellan recalls a German tourist once describing the experience as being among “the lungs of the ocean”. A perfect description, I think. After the guided tour, we return our gear to McClellan. I ask him about future snorkelling lessons, which cost $79 per adult on group tours. It is something I want to come back and do again, next time with my family. He says snorkelling is “easy entry”. “People get nervous about aquatic activities. But getting nervous is a great human feeling. And snorkelling is a good start at doing something adventurous. “It’s one of those cool activities that generations of family can do together … A lot of adventure activities are strenuous. But kids, parents, grandkids, grandparents can all snorkel.” Plus, it doesn’t take much to start. McClellan says purchasing a “good mask” will cost $80 or less. A wetsuit ranges from $100 to $200; though not essential, it will protect your body from the temperatures of the ocean, allowing you to stay in the water for longer. It will also “last you a decade”, McClellan says. “And the water is free.” The Cabbage Tree Bay aquatic reserve is McClellan’s top snorkelling spot in Sydney. He says conservation efforts made it so. “It has been a no fishing zone since 2002.” Since then, the area has flourished. The aquatic reserve is home to more than 150 species of fish, including protected and threatened species like weedy seadragons and elegant wrasse. Other aquatic reserves – like Clovelly and Fisherman’s Beach at Long Reef in Sydney – are great spots for beginner snorkellers. Outside of the harbour city, would-be snorkellers should look for spots with calm waters, and ideally some kind of conservation status – protection of marine biodiversity means there is lots to see. “This is an awesome example of good conservation management, and we can do better,” McClellan says of Cabbage Tree Bay. “Natural space like this – it is priceless.” This piece was supported by Destination NSW and EcoTreasures",Lifestyle/Life and style,A beginner’s guide to snorkelling: ‘Slow down … you see the most amazing stuff’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/02/a-beginners-guide-to-snorkelling-slow-down-you-see-the-most-amazing-stuff
1/2/2022,"It’s totally understandable why someone you were once inseparable with might fade out of your life. People move cities, change jobs, have children. Or maybe they embraced the paleo diet while you embraced the cronut craze. Inevitably some friendships are made for a stage of life rather than a lifetime.  The forgotten birthdays and missed milestones make it seem all the more impossible to make contact out of the blue. Sure, Facebook tells you they danced at their cousin’s wedding or started a podcast about flightless birds, but liking the odd post is not quite the same. I’m not suggesting suddenly spamming all your old friends, but some stand out from the past. If you find yourself stalking them on social media (exes excluded) or reminiscing about the good times you had together, that’s probably the best gauge that there’s something there worth revisiting. So if you’re under 40 and the idea of actually talking on the phone sounds terrifying, how about sending them an email or a DM? The new year is a good time to say “Hey, long time no see, how about that pandemic?” No need to explain the extended silence; it’s safe to assume they feel the same way, so it’s unlikely they’ll hold it against you. There’s no particular script to follow. I prefer to skip the boring stuff like career moves or house upgrades and jump into more important achievements, like mastering the DIY lockdown haircut and coming fourth in the work step competition. Think of whatever bound you together in the first place and you’ll figure out what to say. If in doubt, talk about Squid Game. It could be a one-off interaction, or it could spark a back and forth like old times. Either way, it will remind your old friend that despite the time passed, you still value them.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Easy wins: reminiscing about past friends?

1/2/2022,"Almost two years on from the emergence of Covid, people have watched borders shut, businesses close, lockdowns lengthen and case numbers climb. A widespread disruption – skewing lives socially, professionally and financially – has prompted people to reconsider the choices they make, who they are, and how they fit in the world. Guardian Australia asked readers to share how the pandemic made them rethink their life. More than 100 reader responses show that emerging from a universally-felt disruption is a new normal. And that new normal looks different for everyone.  The pandemic has made me consider working differently. I started my working life in an era where long hours, long weeks, accumulating unused sick days was almost a way of measuring yourself. A badge of honour. Take a tablet and soldier on. I ask myself more now: who benefits from that stoic drive for being productive? I can see moving back to the country and working to live, not living to work. It has brought into stark relief that I don’t need a lot of stuff to be happy, but I do need connection to people, even if it’s virtual. This has led me to shop less, start working through clearing things I don’t need from my house for it to be more minimalist and tidy.I’ve fallen ever so in love with my local library. Means I read more and spend less on books. I’ve also realised that health is number one. I quit my depressing job two months into 2020 lockdown. A job that was morally and ethically against my values. An environment that affected my mental health and self-esteem … I found a job that I loved within a month and have never looked back. The pandemic pushed me to make my life … meaningful again, and I believe I’m on the right track. I made two films, have a wonderful, loving partner, am living overseas for the first time and have set the bar high professionally. I never want to work for something I don’t believe in, and I have discovered the drive to achieve this. Yes, being largely restricted to my house [during] lockdown left me feeling stiff and sore and old. So I decided to get back into running, something I did some years ago but gave up when I moved houses and lost my routine. Starting very slowly using the Couch to 5k app, I gradually started running again and am now running 4-5km most days. It’s great! I listen to podcasts as I run and it’s a time when I feel free and relaxed. I’m much more mobile and I feel like my body is 10 years younger again! No more sore knees walking up and down the stairs! It has reminded me that it is important to seize the moment, to enjoy what is available for me to enjoy. Enjoy the moment, take my pleasures where and when I can find them. I am doing more cooking and more baking than I have in years and loving it. I have also realised, belatedly, that a relatively solitary existence is just fine, particularly with the companionship of a good dog. It has reminded me that the most important things in life are our health, our experiences and our friends and family. Work doesn’t matter so much and it’s not worth the stress. It’s a miracle we’re even here to begin with, so why would we want to spend most of our lives working just to make someone else richer? The standard path of: get a degree/trade, find career, get married, buy a house, have children, retire and then finally be free and travel or do what you always wanted to do … seems like a waste of a human life to me. It’s a never-ending hamster wheel that’s tricking us into chasing things that we think will make us happy, but happiness already exists inside of us. We don’t need to reach any of those levels to attain it. It seems futile. I now want to focus on enjoying my life and being a better person. I guess I want more freedom in my life and to be less tied down by a career. I would also like to live a more sustainable life so that I am doing my best to leave the planet in a survivable condition for the next generations. I hope we see a massive revolution in the way we work and live that no longer exploits us or the planet. It has made me want to pursue work that I actually like to do … I would like to be more in control of my own choices. I walk every morning now with my husband and the dog before work. This has meant we have talked lots, we fight less, it has been great for our marriage! I would love to keep this. Less transport is so much better. Less sitting in a dark, cold office. So much nicer to see the green outside my own house. I found myself wanting to find out more about my own self. I was needing to work out contentment and for me I found that could only come from inside. I starting reading books and I found texts like Intimacy and Solitude by Stephanie Dowrick and Total Meditation by Deepak Chopra. I also Read 1Q84 by Murakami … I find my inner self the most important thing now. I try to engage with the outside world on my terms. I realised that caring for everyone else but not taking care of myself was a really dumb thing to do. I have come to the realisation [that] this is my life and I want to live it differently. It will not be the long-term vision I had prior to the pandemic, but it will allow me to be valued as an individual. I have embraced new opportunities at full throttle where I continue to use my talents for the greater good and people appreciate what I do. It has emphasised the importance of family. I want a more balanced life, where family and career can go hand in hand. Previously I had thought that there always needed to be a compromise, however I now realise that with the advent of virtual learning and virtual working, it is more possible than ever before. Physical health has become more of a priority. Having more opportunities to work from home has been a great change of pace and I have seen it manifest in my physical health too (less hair loss, weight management etc). I loved travel … I had plans to visit Morocco, Turkey, Spain and other parts of Africa and Europe. But I now accept the reality. So, getting to see more of Australia is now more important than seeing other countries. And I really want to spend more time in the bush. I have become more healthy and fit during the pandemic. I have increased my time at the gym … I go for longer jog/walks several times a week. I go to a sauna and spa a few times a week. And I use the treadmill a few times a week … I just want to enjoy things.Mentally, the pandemic has increased my reading, music listening, watching old movies and new TV series. Simplifying my life and prioritising what is important to me has been good for my mental health. Less wine is good for my health. Saying no to socialising when I don’t want to is good for my mental health. Reading has been a great pleasure. Now I will spend an entire weekend indoors reading, not feeling the need to go anywhere. Intellectual stimulation feeds my soul and I am getting this from books. I have realised that other forms of indoor entertainment such as podcasts and good TV can be far more stimulating than going out. I would love to quit my job. I realised that I spent a lot of money on things that I did not miss at all, such as eating out … I really don’t need new clothes, or as many trips away. I really embraced being a homebody … I have really embraced my introversion. I now only want to spend money on outings that I am passionate about.Lockdown really made me appreciate where I live, near the beach. Considering that one of the allowed activities was exercising, I realised that a walk in nature is something not to be taken for granted.I have realised that the simple things in life are the best. The pandemic was not a negative experience for me. It’s made me prioritise what is important in my life.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Guardian Australia readers respond: how has the pandemic made you rethink life?,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/02/guardian-australia-readers-respond-how-has-the-pandemic-made-you-rethink-life
1/2/2022,"After more than two decades as a subeditor, I know language is alchemy and there’s no exact prescription for good writing. But I also know grammar is central. Meaning can turn on a single word or punctuation mark and a little fine-tuning can prevent ambiguity and inconsistency. Just read this sentence and tell me grammar doesn’t matter: After being whipped fiercely, the cook boiled the egg.  Almost everyone has a grammatical pet peeve, and commas attract a lot of attention. When they’re needed, they’re essential – compare “I’m sorry I love you” and “I’m sorry, I love you”. But haphazard or unwarranted commas can be distracting and even misleading. Jonathan Franzen wrote a whole essay on the “irritating, lazy mannerism” of comma-then, as in: “He dims the lamp and opens the window, then pulls the body inside.” I sympathise but I’m personally more irritated by comma-but and comma-too. The Guardian style guide is clear on the Oxford comma (comma-and in a list); it’s definitely not needed in “he ate ham, eggs and chips”, although an essential distinction between these two sentences: I dedicate this book to my parents, Martin Amis, and JK Rowling. I dedicate this book to my parents, Martin Amis and JK Rowling. But I give punctuation champion Lynne Truss the last word: “Don’t use commas like a stupid person. I mean it.” On non-comma matters, F Scott Fitzgerald thought the exclamation mark was “like laughing at your own joke” and should be done away with, and Milan Kundera claimed he once left a publisher for trying to change his semicolons to full-stops. (I’m a big fan of the semicolon; it encourages the reader to linger a little longer on the thought before it.) And Proust cringed at cliches: “It’s quite true that the sun is on fire at sunset, but it’s been said too often.” Some of my personal bugbears come up more regularly than others. “Compared to” is different from “compared with”. Use the first if you want to liken one thing to another, the second to contrast. And that reminds me: in my book “different from” is correct, “different to” and “different than” are not. “Who” and “whom” are both needed but not interchangeable. The same goes for less/fewer, like/such as and imply/infer. And there’s a simple rule for “that” v “which”: if the sentence needs the (restrictive) clause the word is connecting it to, use “that”, otherwise use “which”. (Some of the grammarati point to an irregular restrictive “which” that can replace “that” but I’m yet to be convinced.) If all of this sounds like so much nerdy nitpicking, I concede some arcane rules are just begging to be bent, although I would still argue you have to have a good reason. The Guardian says it’s fine to split infinitives because “stubbornly to resist so can sound pompous and awkward”. Ditto on ending a sentence with a preposition. And while strictly plural, “data” can take a singular verb, as in “data shows”, because how often do you come across “datum” anyway? Common sense should come into it, and so too aesthetics. Think of how the prose flows. If a sentence is long and inelegant, change it. Sometimes I use an en dash or even parentheses to break up a string of commas. And don’t dangle a verb at the end of the sentence, far from its subject. “How high will emissions from the project proposed for the northern region and the existing plants in the south and west be?” is just ungainly. Words should sound right too. If you’re torn over whether the possessive of James takes a second S after the apostrophe – James’s – say it out loud. To quote Joan Didion, grammar is “a piano played by ear”. Some words have lost their meaning from overuse. I once edited out three appearances of “iconic” on a single day; “unforgettable”, “infamous” and “emblematic” stepped in admirably. Others become unusable if they’re loaded with an agenda. Politicisation is dangerous. As Orwell said: “If thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.” Language matters. It matters how laws and treaties are written, and whether coal is “phased out” or “phased down”. It matters that news is truthful and that literature inspires. Language reflects – and can even define – who we are. So a little respect, please, for its rules.

1/2/2022,"In 1944, George Orwell got a letter from TS Eliot, a director at Faber, rejecting his political satire, Animal Farm. There were several reasons. First, it was not the right time. Also, said the creator of The Waste Land, “the effect is simply one of negation”. The poet took issue, too, with the wholesale disrespecting of pigs, since they were logically the “best qualified to run the farm”, being the cleverest. “What was needed (someone might argue) was not more communism but more public spirited pigs.” So, if some leading film critics watching Adam McKay’s Don’t Look Up (currently most-watched on Netflix) have hankered for a less satirical kind of satire, they are in distinguished company. TS Eliot might well have agreed with these reviewers that McKay’s savaging of a society too corrupt and deluded to save itself from an urgent threat to life on Earth, in the film’s case, a comet, could have been more cheerfully done. For instance, echoing Eliot on pigs, some of the more cartoonish leads could have been made more relatable. How about humanising lead villain Peter Isherwell (Mark Rylance being mesmerising), a creepy tech billionaire who, absurdly, intends to live forever? Meanwhile, McKay’s US president, the preposterous Janie Orlean (Meryl Streep) has appointed her dreadful son chief of staff. Why can’t these grievous weirdos with their silly dialogue be more like, say, Donald Trump, Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk?  Even the obscure scientists (Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence) attempting to convince an irresponsible leader and a clicks-obsessed media that the Earth truly is in danger, should, it’s been suggested, have been awarded intriguing personal journeys that would offset the more apocalyptic content. Implicit in the professional objections to this film – it is “angry”, “smug”, “sad”, “shrill”, “condescending”, “scattergun”, “disastrous”, “insensitive”, “unfunny”, “depressing”, “heavy handed” but also “toothless” – is the proposal that, if McKay wanted to jolt disengaged people into noticing, even talking about, collective complacency on global warming, some sort of gentler, more immersive approach could have been more effective. How would that work? Maybe imagine Swift’s A Modest Proposal if he’d cut all the heavy-handed sarcasm, stopped droning on about mirrors and considered how baby-eating made vegans feel. Or something akin to political cartoons minus any dung, pigs or insensitive face/body caricature. That the film has, however, an approval rating of 77% against the critics’ 55% (on Rotten Tomatoes) could indicate that the public has a relatively higher tolerance for angry, broad, insulting etc material, at least when this feels like a justifiable response to current politics. Though it helps if it’s funny, biting, gleefully performed by an incredible cast and finally pulls off a massive tonal shift, from propulsive near-farce to stillness and regret. “We really did have everything, didn’t we?” says DiCaprio’s scientist. “I mean, if you think about it.” In fact, Don’t Look Up ends, for all its irksome negativity, by telling us something unusually positive about satire. Maybe, for all the repeated announcements of its death or terminal feebleness, this genre can still be revived, as now, into vigorous, exhilarating life? After the disparaging reviews, scientists in particular responded that the film’s depiction of their discipline being ignored and trivialised rings utterly true. Peter Kalmus, a climate scientist, called it “the most accurate film about society’s terrifying non-response to climate breakdown I’ve seen”. “Keep it light, fun,” the fictional scientists are exhorted, before discussing imminent extinction on a Fox-like chatshow. And “couldn’t it have been more light, fun?” is a fair summary, by coincidence, of the advice for McKay from detractors. Events dictated that his film offers an additional, aka “scattergun”, commentary on leaders who in the pandemic favoured President Orlean’s approach to an incoming health catastrophe: “sit tight and assess”. No satirist could have anticipated Trump’s bleach advocacy or his fellow fantasist Boris Johnson’s view of the virus as an adversary to be, when he chose to acknowledge its existence, “wrestled to the floor”. McKay’s film doesn’t feature a hilariously vain government figure shagging in the face of extinction: sensitive audiences would probably have thought a Hancockian character either in poor taste, heavy handed or simply unbelievable. “It was already a crazy script but I would say reality out-crazied us by like 10 to 15%,” McKay said. “Well done, reality.” It’s largely because of this routine out-crazying by the usual suspects that satire became the subject of repeated obituaries. But given the professional bollocking administered to McKay’s death-defying production it could also be that old-school, Swiftian satire – that is, not nice and not nuanced – has itself dwindled in appeal. Supposing, as Professor Robert Phiddian has argued, contemporary academics find the conventions of satire frustratingly arbitrary and simplifying, it could be that certain viewers similarly bridle at a film whose authorial intention lies beyond productive dispute. Though shamelessness in public life hasn’t, as it turns out, rendered satire impossible, it hardly invites subtle treatment. How, with the recommended light touch, is a satirist supposed to ridicule a leader who, performing press-ups or other tricks for free editorial, counts his absurdity as a superpower? Nor, given Boris Johnson’s likely successors, is his departure likely to reset satirical standards to those prevailing when Dr Strangelove, with which McKay’s film has been disobligingly compared, was having fun with double entendres. Liz Truss, Johnson’s would-be replacement, was posing in scarlet costumes and an eye-catching new pompadour well before Meryl Streep was accused by critics of overdoing it as the scarlet-suited, over-ringleted President Orlean. Actually, when compared with Truss’s patriotic cheese oration (“That. Is. A. Disgrace”), President Orlean’s rhetoric as she, too, poses as saviour of the free world, is notably sane. Truss won’t be impossible to satirise, but any attempt that isn’t at least unkind, angry, shrill, insensitive, preposterous and depressing is likely to look like PR.

1/2/2022,"A 15-year-old boy stabbed to death in Croydon, south London, on Thursday has been identified as Zaian Aimable-Lina, the Metropolitan police said. Police have said Zaian was from the local area.  A 15-year-old boy who was arrested on suspicion of murder has been released on bail to a date in late January. Zaian’s death marked the 29th teenage homicide in London in 2021, surpassing the 27 seen in 2017, which had been the highest in recent years. The previous peak was 29 teenage homicides in the capital in 2008. However, within minutes of Zaian’s death a 16-year-old boy died after being stabbed to death at Philpots Farm Open Space in Yiewsley, Hillingdon, west London, making him the 30th teenage homicide in the capital in 2021. Met Police Commander Alex Murray said: “I am deeply saddened by every single homicide this year, and greatly concerned by those that have been teenage killings. Each one is a tragedy leaving behind heartbroken families and distressed communities. “My thoughts are with the victims and all those impacted. They are not statistics, not just numbers, they all have families, and they all should have had their lives ahead of them. “They and their families have been robbed of something precious and we should all be doing everything we can to stop this,” he said. He added that the police were devoting “huge resources” to preventing homicides and said the Met was not “complacent” about knife crime. Chief Inspector Richard Leonard said: “My thoughts continue to be with Zaian’s family and friends as they cope with this tragic loss. My team are continuing to work around the clock so that we can give Zaian’s family the answers they deserve. “Zaian’s death has sent shockwaves through the local community and London as a whole. He was just 15 years old and had his whole life ahead of him, and we need the community to work with us to bring those responsible to justice.” In a Twitter thread, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said he was “devastated” by the deaths of the two boys and he was in close contact with the Met “who are doing everything possible to bring those responsible to justice”. He said the safety of Londoners “will always be my number one priority” and he was “investing record amounts in policing to put more officers on the streets and creating positive opportunities for almost 100,000 young Londoners, helping to divert them away from violence”.
