3/30/2022,"Some 1.5bn items of personal protective equipment (PPE) in storage in England have passed their expiry date, the public spending watchdog has revealed, as health officials are urging the government to “get a grip” on stocks and contracts. More than 3.6bn PPE items are being stored by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) because it considers them unsuitable for frontline services, accounting for 11% of all PPE it has received, the National Audit Office (NAO) said after its investigation into the management of PPE contracts. Its report said that more than half of 51 so-called VIP suppliers – companies suggested by government officials, ministers’ offices, members of parliament, senior NHS staff and other health professionals – provided PPE that was unsuitable for frontline services. Some of the reasons the PPE was unsuitable was because it would take too long to assemble, there were concerns about modern slavery, or paperwork was missing. Between March 2020 and October 2021, it cost the DHSC £737m to store PPE, including penalty charges of £436m because it had to store PPE in containers for longer than expected. Furthermore, the department continues to manage 176 contracts where it is in dispute, where it believes it may not achieve full value for money, putting an estimated £2.7bn at risk. In total, DHSC has spent £12.6bn of the total £13.1bn it expects to spend on almost 38bn items of PPE. Meg Hillier, a Labour MP and chair of the Commons public accounts committee, said: “The numbers are staggering – over 30bn items of PPE received so far with 5bn more on the way and 3.6bn items that can’t be used by frontline services. Storage alone has cost over £700m, with DHSC continuing to spend £7m a month storing PPE it doesn’t need. “Whatever forbearance the taxpayer may have had at the start of the pandemic, this will quickly wear thin if DHSC can’t now manage the consequences. The department must urgently get a grip of its PPE stocks and focus on protecting value for taxpayers. It has to claw back contract costs where it can, get rid of unusable PPE, and cut down on expensive storage.” Officials rushed to buy the equipment at the start of the pandemic and the NAO watchdog recognised there was “an extremely over-heated global market, with desperate customers competing against each other, pushing up prices and buying huge volumes of PPE”. But the report said there were “inconsistencies” between the volume of PPE ordered and what was received, and that billions of items were not suitable for frontline use. The NAO report detailed how the DHSC awarded 394 contracts worth £7.9bn through two new supply chains. Some 9,492 contracts worth £5.2bn were agreed through the existing NHS supply chain. Of the 394 contracts, 115 went to 51 VIP lane suppliers and 46 of these did not go through due diligence checks, which were only put in place from May 2020 onwards. The report said the DHSC paid out £2.5bn to suppliers upfront – before PPE was received – to “prevent contracted PPE being gazumped while in transit”. Five of those upfront payment contracts, worth £19m were at risk of not being delivered, the report said. Of the PPE that has been received, 17.3bn items (55%) have been sent to frontline staff, but 14.1bn items – worth £8.5bn – remain in storage, either in one of 50 warehouses, with suppliers, or in shipping containers. The DHSC said: “Our priority throughout the pandemic has been saving lives, and we have delivered over 19.1bn items of PPE to frontline staff to keep them safe. Having too much PPE was preferable to having too little in the face of an unpredictable and dangerous virus, given this was essential to keep our NHS open and protect as many people as possible. “Where contracts are in dispute, we are seeking to recover costs from suppliers and we expect to recover significant amounts of taxpayers’ money.”",News/Society,"1.5bn unused PPE items in England have passed expiry date, says audit office",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/30/15bn-unused-ppe-items-in-england-have-passed-expiry-date-says-audit-office
3/30/2022,"The UK’s poorest families will see the amount of spare cash at their disposal drop by a fifth this year with £850 less to spend on non-essentials as shop prices hit a decade high. Pressure on family budgets is tightening as grocery price inflation reached 5.2% in March, the highest level since April 2012, according to the latest figures from market analysts Kantar. The company said prices were rising fastest for pet food and savoury snacks, such as crisps, but were still falling for some products such as fresh bacon. Spare cash is also under pressure from rises in the price of clothing and furnishings with non-food retail price inflation accelerating to 1.5% in March, from 1.3% in February, according to the latest report from the British Retail Consortium (BRC). This is the highest rate of non-food inflation since February 2011. Price rises are being fuelled by the rising cost of labour and basic commodities such as wheat and cooking oil – as well as energy and packaging driven by a combination of Brexit, resurgence in demand as economies reopen after pandemic lockdowns and the war in Ukraine. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said the full impact of rising costs for retailers and their suppliers was “yet to be seen”. “There have been mounting cost pressures throughout the supply chain for some time, including rising wages, input costs, global commodity prices, energy, and transport. Many of these costs are beginning to be exacerbated by the situation in Ukraine,” she said. Rising energy bills, food and transport costs are set to plunge many into the red with 13% of households claiming they are only just about managing to cover minimum payments on credit card bills with a further 6% already unable to, according to analysts at Retail Economics and digital wallet HyperJar. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said: “Rising inflation will see spending power under huge pressure, particularly for the least affluent households who spend a disproportionate amount of their income on non-discretionary items such as food, energy, and fuel.” For the average family, the cash left after paying for essentials will fall by almost 6.5% or £430 according to Retail Economics. “We’re likely to see recessionary behaviours kick in for many households who will cut back on the nice-to-haves and prioritise low costs to make their budgets stretch that little bit further,” Lim said. He said consumers typically cut back on non-essentials such as electrical goods, takeaways and recreational activities, traded down to cheaper alternatives and scaled back big-ticket purchases such as holidays abroad. In one sign of change, discounter Aldi grabbed its biggest share of the grocery market to date while Lidl matched its previous peak, according to the latest industry data from Kantar. The two chains were the only major supermarkets in the UK to expand in the three months to 20 March, helping Lidl confirm its spot as the UK’s sixth-largest supermarket chain ahead of the Co-op with 6.4% market share while Aldi reached 8.6%, less than 1% behind the UK’s fourth-largest chain, Morrisons. .",News/Business,UK’s low-income families to lose a fifth of their spare cash in 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/30/uks-low-income-families-to-lose-a-fifth-of-their-spare-cash-in-2022
3/30/2022,"Gareth Southgate vented his disgust at the England fans who booed Harry Maguire before the 3-0 friendly win over Ivory Coast, calling their actions “an absolute joke”. Maguire’s struggles with Manchester United had been a hot topic in the buildup to this international break and there were boos from sections of the crowd when his name was read out before kick-off, with further jeering upon his first few touches of the ball. The defender made light of it with a composed performance, which included roles in England’s first two goals, and his manager left no doubt that he thought the abuse was unacceptable. “I thought the reception was a joke,” Southgate said. “An absolute joke. I don’t get it. What he has done for us is phenomenal. “We’re either all in this together or we’re not. He’s in an England shirt and not only should you support a player in an England shirt regardless but, when you have played to the level he has and put in the performances he has, it should be total commitment. “The team are totally united and we recognise everyone has difficult moments, and he will come through it. They are real England fans and some are influenced by, I don’t know, social media or ex-players influencing opinion. It has never been acceptable. Why are players going to play any better? Fans should get behind their team.” Southgate also expressed concern that the supporters’ reaction could have a wider effect. “Don’t think that some of the other players wouldn’t be looking at that thinking: ‘That could be me one day’,” he said. “That’s been one of the problems with playing for England. How that is going to benefit anybody I really don’t understand.” Jack Grealish, who set up England’s second goal for Raheem Sterling, echoed Southgate’s sentiment. “I think it’s ridiculous,” he said. “Harry’s been unbelievable for this country in the World Cup, the Euros, outstanding. I think even tonight he was brilliant. It wasn’t nice to hear boos for Harry and the whole team didn’t like it one bit.” Grealish also confirmed that he had asked the referee, Erik Lambrechts, to exercise common sense when he showed Serge Aurier a second yellow card five minutes before half-time. The forward could be seen talking to Lambrechts at the time and felt that, given the low stakes and the moderateness of the offence, Aurier should have stayed on. “You want a good game, 11 v 11, it’s not as if he has absolutely smashed someone,” he said. “I do think it killed the game a little bit. I was just saying to the ref ‘come on, leave him’, but I don’t think there was anyone changing his mind.” Southgate appeared to agree, calling the red card “a shame for us from a learning point of view, and also for the fans as a spectacle”. On the match, Southgate was pleased with the performance. “I thought the mentality at the start was really good,” he said. “It was of course the red card which changes the game which was a shame in terms of the test we wanted.”",Sport/Football,‘Absolute joke’: Southgate hits out at England fans who booed Harry Maguire,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/29/england-football-ivory-coast-harry-maguire-gareth-southgate-booing
3/30/2022,"A police misconduct hearing involving three senior officers after accusations of a sexual offence at a drinks party will be held in private, with the public and media banned. Ch Supt Mark Warrender and Ch Supt Marc Budden were suspended after an alleged incident at a party held in Cardiff in June 2019 after a retirement function for the former Gwent police chief constable, Julian Williams. The pair, together with Ch Insp Paul Staniforth, are due to face a misconduct hearing on 7 April, but its chair has ruled that it will be held behind closed doors after all three men and Gwent police appealed for it to be held in private. It means that the only public record of the hearing – in which the three each face an allegation of gross misconduct – will be a summary posted on the force’s website that may have little more detail than the names and decision. Avon and Somerset police carried out an independent investigation into allegations against Warrender and Budden directed by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. In March last year the Crown Prosecution Service said the men would not be charged. It said: “We considered the offence of sexual assault against one officer and misconduct in public office and the improper exercise of police powers against the second officer.” Warrender was investigated over an allegation of sexual assault. The force and the three officers argued that next week’s misconduct hearing should be heard in private to ensure the anonymity of a complainant is preserved, to protect the right to privacy of the officers, witnesses and their families, and to encourage others to report alleged wrongdoing in the future. WalesOnline, the BBC and the Caerphilly Observer challenged the move by the force and the officers. WalesOnline argued strongly that the default position was that all proceedings in courts and tribunals should be conducted in public. Its lawyers said that the media routinely covers cases involving alleged sexual offences, in which complainants receive lifelong anonymity. But the chair ruled it should be held in private. Politicians in Wales strongly criticised the decision. Natasha Asghar, Conservative Senedd member for South Wales East, told WalesOnline that events such as the Sarah Everard case meant that there needed to be “totally transparency” in disciplinary hearings. Natasha Asghar (@natasghar) said: “It is absolutely vital that the public has confidence in our police and gives them their full support in the tough job they do in keeping our streets safe. Anything which undermines public confidence is therefore a matter of great concern."" Another Senedd member, Laura Anne Jones, added: “Quite clearly it’s in the public interest for the public to hear the full facts of this case, especially in light of the recent problems with the Metropolitan police.”",News/UK news,Police misconduct hearing for sexual offence to be held in private,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/29/police-misconduct-hearing-for-sexual-offence-held-in-private
3/30/2022,"The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) argued to reject a 64-year-old Aboriginal man who relied on a “homemade walking stick” to get into the shower from joining the NDIS, saying he could instead get aged care services at an earlier age. The argument put forward by the agency was rejected as “extraordinary” by administrative appeals tribunal (AAT) member Simon Webb in a judgment published last week. Webb said the man was eligible for the scheme, granting him access four years after he had first sought support from the NDIS for a range of physical and psychiatric conditions. The man, known only as JLZT and who lives on the disability support pension, had a history of neglect and sexual abuse as a child and “compounding life traumas as an adult”, according to Webb’s judgment. He is now 68 years old but was 64 when he first applied for the scheme. Under the NDIS, people over the age of 65 are not eligible to enter the scheme, a rule that some people have been calling on the government to change. The AAT was reviewing the agency’s decision to deny him support at 64 years old, meaning if the original NDIA decision was found to be incorrect, he was still able to get NDIS support. Webb outlined what he described as an “extraordinary” claim from the NDIA in his judgment. Noting that under section 24(e) of the NDIS Act, an applicant must prove they are likely to require support under the scheme for life, Webb said: “In JLZT’s case it was suggested that, as an Aboriginal person, JLZT may be eligible for the provision of support under the commonwealth My Aged Care program prior to pension age, at age 50 or 55, and this would mean the threshold in s24(1)(e) cannot be met.” “This submission must be rejected,” Webb said. “It proceeds on the rather extraordinary basis that any person who may at some point in their life become eligible for the provision of support under the My Aged Care program is to be excluded from the scheme. “The same result would apply were a person … potentially eligible at some point in the future for any other program or service that provides supports or assistance for people with disability.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The case comes amid increasing concern from disability advocates and NDIS participants about the agency’s decision-making, with data showing a 400% increase in NDIS appeals to the AAT. Labor has also raised concerns about the agency’s spending on legal fees, noting it paid out $17.3m in 2020-21 to firms representing the agency in “external matters”, up from $13.4m the previous year. An NDIA spokesperson said the agency had initially found the man did not meet the access criteria, including “permanence of impairments and substantial reduction in functional capacity”. The spokesperson suggested the argument the man was ineligible because he could access aged care was not raised in its written submissions, only at the later hearing. “At the substantive hearing, the suggestion that the application may be eligible for aged care support was raised in the context of s24.1(e), that is the requirement for lifetime support from the NDIS, which must be satisfied for access to be granted,” he said. Darren O’Donovan, an administrative law expert at La Trobe University, said the case had serious implications. He said the NDIA had argued that “if a person can or will rely on another service system in the future, it has the discretion to refuse them from the scheme”. “Even where a person’s disability is permanent and severe, it argued it had a discretion to say NDIS access was inappropriate as the person may get support somewhere else,” he said. O’Donovan said the agency should “publicly disavow its approach and review any cases where this interpretation was the sole basis for refusing access”. Webb also found the agency had “misconstrued” the legislation. In his judgment, Webb said the man in question had first applied for the scheme in 2017, but was knocked back. He applied again in 2018 with supporting evidence from his GP but was again rejected. Subsequent reviews also upheld the rejection decision, culminating in the AAT hearings before Webb in early March. Webb said the evidence showed that the man had suffered from chronic neck, thoracic and lower back pain, and right knee osteoarthritis. He also suffered psychiatric conditions including major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic psychosis associated with a schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia, and a paranoid personality disorder. Webb found the man had reduced capacity in a range of areas including with mobility, practical tasks, communication, learning and social interaction. He reportedly relied on a “homemade suspended walking stick” as a “substitute grab-rail to facilitate transfers into and out of the shower”, which was over the bath at his home. His mobility issues also made it hard for him to use the toilet. “JLZT’s use of such aids raises safety concerns, especially as JLZT lives alone and is socially isolated,” Webb said the evidence suggested. NDIS participants can apply for assistive technology and home modifications once approved for support. The NDIA spokesperson said the agency was “considering the AAT decision”. “We are implementing the outcome of the AAT decision – while we consider the decision,” the spokesperson said.",News/Australia news,"NDIA wanted Aboriginal man, 64, who relied on ‘homemade walking stick’ rejected from scheme",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/ndia-wanted-aboriginal-man-64-who-relied-on-homemade-walking-stick-rejected-from-scheme
