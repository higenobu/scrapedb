4/16/2022,"Days before his birthday in August 2019, an employee at a Kentucky-based laboratory asked his office manager to not arrange a celebration for his birthday. It wasn’t the fear of getting older, but rather an anxiety disorder that can spur “panic attacks in stressful situations,” according to court documents. The employee, who was hired in October 2018 by Gravity Diagnostics, did not want a celebration because “being the center of attention” can trigger his disorder, the documents state. When the company threw him a lunchtime party against his wishes, it triggered a panic attack and he left abruptly to spend his break in his car. Four days later, after his office managers confronted him about his reaction to the party, he was fired from the Northern Kentucky company, court records show. He eventually sued Gravity Diagnostics, and this week, a jury awarded the man $450,000 in damages for his lost wages and emotional distress. An attorney for Gravity Diagnostics did not immediately respond to a request for comment by McClatchy News. Gravity Diagnostics is based out of Covington, Kentucky, and says it provides “innovative laboratory testing” for physicians and patients. Julie Brazil, the founder and chief operating officer of Gravity Diagnostics, claims it was the other employees who were victimized, she told Link NKY. “My employees de-escalated the situation to get the plaintiff out of the building as quickly as possible while removing his access to the building, alerting me and sending out security reminders to ensure he could not access the building, which is exactly what they were supposed to do,” Brazil told Link NKY. “As an employer who puts our employee safety first, we have a zero-tolerance policy and we stand by our decision to terminate the plaintiff for his violation of our workplace violence policy. When the employee left the office on Aug. 7 to spend the remainder of his birthday lunch in his car, he texted his office manager asking why she failed “to accommodate his request (to) ... forego the standard birthday celebration,” his attorney states. A day later after he arrived for work, he was called into a meeting with two superiors, who “confronted and criticized” him for how he reacted to the birthday party he did not want, according to the lawsuit. This caused him to have another panic attack. He was sent home from work for the next two days and later apologized for having the panic attack. On Aug. 11 he received an email stating “he was being terminated because of the events of the previous week,” the lawsuit states. His attorney said Gravity Diagnostics caused him to suffer “from a loss of income and benefits and emotional distress and mental anxiety.” The lawsuit was filed on grounds of disability discrimination and retaliation. The $450,000 he was awarded includes $120,000 for lost wages and $300,000 for “past, present and future mental pain and suffering, mental anguish, embarrassment, humiliation, mortification and loss of self-esteem,” court records show. His attorney, Tony Bucher, said he was happy to get his client “the vindication that he deserved.” “Few people will know how much courage it took for him to take this case all the way to trial,” Bucher said in a statement to McClatchy News. “More than the financial award, I believe (he) was so happy and relieved that the jury recognized that he was not some violent and menacing person and that it was not okay for Gravity Diagnostics to just assume that he was without any evidence to support those misconceptions.” Gravity Diagnostics will appeal the verdict, Brazil told Link NKY, based on “discovery of juror misconduct violating trial judge’s orders.” Job offer revoked after drug test reveals man’s ADHD medication, Texas lawsuit says ‘Hostile work environment’ at Activision Blizzard led to employee suicide, lawsuit says Man faking back injury got $730K in disability — but was caught weightlifting, feds say",U.S./Lexington Herald-Leader,"Employee’s unwanted birthday party nets him $450,000 after lawsuit against KY company",https://news.yahoo.com/employee-unwanted-birthday-party-nets-140433784.html
4/16/2022,"Like anyone in his position would be, Volodymyr Zelensky is tired of repeating himself. In a wide-ranging interview with The Atlantic, the Ukrainian president lamented the repetitive nature of his many telephone, Zoom, and Skype calls with world leaders, who are often asking him the same questions about the ongoing Russian invasion. ""I like new questions,"" Zelensky told The Atlantic. ""It's not interesting to answer the questions you already heard."" ""When some leaders ask me what weapons I need, I need a moment to calm myself, because I already told them the week before,"" Zelensky continued. ""It's Groundhog Day. I feel like Bill Murray."" Still, even when it seems he's living the same moment over and over, ""[h]e says he has no choice but to keep trying,"" the Atlantic writes. The world's leaders ""are not against us,"" Zelensky said. ""They just live in a different situation. As long as they have not lost their parents and children, they do not feel the way we feel."" Take the conversations he's had with soldiers in the decimated city of Mariupol, where 21,000 civilians have been killed so far, for example, the Atlantic writes. ""They say, 'We need help; we have four hours.' And even in Kyiv we don't understand what four hours are,"" Zelensky said. ""In [Washington, D.C.] for sure they can't understand. However, we are grateful to the U.S., because the planes with weapons are still coming."" Read more at The Atlantic.

4/16/2022,"Russia warned the U.S. and NATO this week that there could be ""unpredictable consequences"" if they continue to send Ukraine ""sensitive"" weapons as it prepares to launch a massive ground offensive in eastern Ukraine, a report said Friday. The Biden administration announced that another $800 million in security assistance would be sent to Ukraine Wednesday, including artillery, coastal defense drones, anti-aircraft and anti-tank armored vehicles, and Mi-17 helicopters. RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said the defense systems approved by the U.S. are ""reflective of the kind of fighting that the Ukrainians are expecting to be faced with"" as Russia focuses on eastern Ukraine. The announcement came one month after President Biden had approved a separate $800 million arms package for Kyiv. But Moscow is taking issue with the sophisticated systems that the U.S. and NATO nations are arming Ukraine with and in a diplomatic démarche this week accused the U.S. of ""adding fuel"" to its war, first reported the Washington Post Friday. The State Department did not immediately respond to Fox News' questions. The U.S. has provided roughly $2.7 billion in security assistance for Ukraine – $1.7 billion of which has been granted since the start of the invasion. RUSSIA SETS UP 'SHAPING OPERATION' TO PREPARE FOR MAJOR GROUND OFFENSIVE IN DONBAS: SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly asked that more aid be provided from allied nations more quickly as Kyiv prepares for what defense officials have warned will be an even more brutal fight in the Donbas. A senior U.S. defense official told reporters this week that the U.S. has been getting defensive aid to Ukraine at ""unprecedented speeds"" and noted that it takes just one week from the time Biden signs off on an aid package to when it gets into Ukrainian hands. An entire delivery of an arms package takes roughly four weeks. ""I would remind [you] that we front load. Every shipment has a mix of material on board,"" the official said, noting that the last shipment contained surface-to-air defenses like Javelin and Stinger missiles, along with Switchblade drones armed with tank-busting warheads. After failing to take Ukraine’s capital, Russia has re-focused its war efforts on the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting for the last eight years. Defense officials have said they believe all of Russia’s ground forces are now in the Donbas region but warned Moscow's major offensive has yet to commence.",World/Fox News,Russia warns US of 'unpredictable consequences' amid latest arms shipment to Ukraine: report,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-warns-us-apos-unpredictable-115538563.html
