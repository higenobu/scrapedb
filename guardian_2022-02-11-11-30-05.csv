2/11/2022,"Religious groups have expressed disappointment at the federal government’s decision to shelve controversial religious discrimination laws, claiming parliament lost sight of the original intent of the legislation. Groups such as the Australian National Imams Council (ANIC) have urged the government to return their focus to the initial purpose of the bill, which was to protect religious minorities.  ANIC spokesperson Bilal Rauf told Guardian Australia it was “disappointing” to see the bill delayed, saying there was a “significant gap” in protective laws. “I think the primary focus of this bill was always those protective provisions to bring it in line with the protections based on other attributes – that was always the primary provision and there was no dispute or question about those proposed provisions,” he said. “The rest was secondary, and sadly the secondary provisions became the subject of debate. “It’s disappointing that it has been shelved, and we hope that it’s something that will quickly be revived and pursued.” Rauf said the ANIC supported the bill because there were currently little to no protections for people based on religion. He said it would give recourse for potential instances of discrimination, such as if a Muslim woman was fired for wearing the veil, or a Muslim man denied time to attend the obligatory Friday prayers. “If a person said ‘I’ve got to go and do something connected with my race or sexual preference or carer responsibility’, the employer has to be very careful because they can be pursued for discrimination. But if it’s a religious activity, the employer can do what they want. “And this really is the first time that there has been any consideration. So that’s a welcome shift, that there’s an acknowledgment that we do need something in circumstances where, for a long time, it wasn’t even an issue in the minds of many.” Rauf also emphasised the importance of the vilification amendments that Labor proposed, mentioning that there was also no recourse for people who faced hate speech rooted in religious belief. “There are already some laws there which protect against vilification based on other attributes. It’s just as important to protect against hate speech based on a person’s religious identity. “We know from direct experience of people in the community that there are many who have had to deal with very acerbic comments based on them wearing the hijab or having a beard or something relating to their religious identity.” Abdullah Khan, the president at the Islamic Schools Association of Australia, told the Guardian that Islamic schools generally supported the bill as a means of protection. “These protections are critical,” he said. “Something that is missing is the protection against vilification based on religion. It’s something we wanted to see addressed by the bill, it’s a protection we need.” “The intent of Islamic schools is not based on discriminating against students on any level, and this was not just about Islamic schools but protecting the whole community.” Ravi Singh, chairman of the Australian Sikh Association, said he supported shelving the bill as it stood, but believed religious discrimination laws should have been introduced 20 years ago. He said his community was confused by the process and debate. “It’s frustrating and a little confusing. We did not clearly know what was being protected and who was being discriminated against. It was hard to distinguish in the end who the bill was serving. “Some parts of the community, especially the LGBTQ communities, had some serious concerns, as well as people in religious institutions. So a lot of questions were raised, and it looked as if they hadn’t been thought through properly. “I think it’s better we take a deep breath and reorganise ourselves to find a better solution for all involved.” Singh said measures to address religious discrimination were long overdue. “These protections are especially important for the Sikh and Muslim communities, because we are easily identifiable. Out kids have faced lots of discrimination in schools for their beards and turbans, and I myself have been called all the names under the sun. “Overall it’s a good step. It was needed over 20 years ago.” Peter Wertheim, the co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said that the shelving of the bill was “preferable” to it being defeated in the Senate. “Although the shelving of the religious discrimination bill will disappoint many faith communities who have been hoping to draw a line against the incremental erosion of religious rights and freedoms in Australia, the delay is preferable to the prospect of the bill being defeated in the Senate after a divisive debate. “This issue is too important to the future of our country to be held hostage to an arbitrary electoral timetable.” “There are major issues standing in the way of an agreement between the Coalition and Labor on the bill, but only a small number of them, and if more time is needed to arrive at a compromise that most of the country will support, then so be it.”",News/Australia news,Australian religious groups say shelving of discrimination bill ‘disappointing’ and ‘confusing’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/11/australian-religious-groups-say-shelving-of-discrimination-bill-disappointing-and-confusing
2/11/2022,"The wildly popular online puzzle Wordle has been credited with keeping people across the world sane amid the ravages of the pandemic. But now it has been hailed as a potential life saver, by providing the clue that helped rescue an 80-year-old woman from a 20-hour home invasion hostage ordeal. Denyse Holt, a retired teacher, found herself locked in her basement in her home in Illinois after being woken up by a naked, knife-wielding intruder in the middle of the night.  After the shivering man got into her bed, he threatened to “cut her” if she screamed before backing down from his threats and asking her to help warm him up in the bath. Eventually, the man locked her in her basement without food or medication, leaving Holt fearing for her life. She told the Washington Post that she tried to rally herself and did exercises to keep herself going. She thought to herself: “I don’t want to die like this, and I don’t want my kids to hear that their mother was murdered.” However, help was at hand, partly thanks to her enthusiasm for Wordle, the viral word game in which players are given six guesses to work out a five-letter word. Thousands of miles away on the west coast the oldest of her two daughters was irritated that her mother had not texted over her Wordle score as she usually did each day. “I didn’t send my older daughter a Wordle in the morning. And that was disconcerting to her,” Holt told Chicago’s WBBM. When the concerned siblings tried to reach their mother on her landline only to be told it was disconnected, they enlisted the help of a neighbour. He found no answer at the door despite Holt’s car still being in the drive and called the police. When they went round they heard her shouting “I’m here! I’m here! I’m here in the basement!” and freed her. They also arrested a 32-year-old man in an upstairs bedroom. They believed he had experienced a mental health crisis.",News/US news,Saved: the Wordle clue that helped rescue 80-year-old woman from hostage ordeal,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/11/saved-the-wordle-clue-that-helped-rescue-80-year-old-woman-from-hostage-ordeal
2/11/2022,"The departure of Cressida Dick as Britain’s most senior police officer is the main story in most of the papers on Friday, although there is some difference in emphasis about whether she deserved her fate. The Guardian led with the line that the Metropolitan police commissioner had to leave because London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, lost confidence in her ability to reform the scandal-hit force.  “Met police chief forced out over toxic culture failings”, its main headline reads, reporting that Dick quit when she realised that her plan to tackle a culture of misogyny and racism among the ranks did not pass muster at City Hall. The Times splash headline says “Scramble for new Met chief after Dick quits” and reports that her resignation had “blindsided” the home secretary, Priti Patel, who now has to find a new chief at a time when the force is investigating her boss, Boris Johnson, over the Downing Street parties scandal. An analysis says it was a “dramatic fall for a police officer once widely regarded as the best of her generation”, but who had become engulfed in scandal. The Telegraph’s main story says “Cressida Dick forced out as head of the Met” and chief reporter Robert Mendick also raises the nagging question about what Dick’s resignation might mean for the under-pressure prime minister. “For Mr Johnson, it remains unclear whether the departure of a commissioner who had his full backing when her contract was up for renewal only last year will have devastating consequences for his career,” Mendick writes. Other papers have a different take, typified by the Mail’s splash headline, which is: “Calamity Cressida fired – but what took so long?”. It says she was responsible for “catastrophic blunders” such as failing to root out Sarah Everard’s murderer Wayne Couzens from the ranks that have “wrecked public trust in police”. The Express leads with “Fears grow for Queen as Charles gets Covid”, but it has picture of Dick on its front page and the headline is along the same lines as the Mail’s: “Scandal hit Yard chief Cressida Dick FINALLY quits”. The i goes with the line that Dick had announced her intention to stay in the post earlier on Thursday, only to later realise that Khan was not going to back her. “Defiant Met chief forced out of Yard”.

The FT’s main front-page picture is of the outgoing police chief and the headline “Dick forced to quit after report into sexism and racism at Met”.

2/11/2022,"Scott Morrison has moved to clarify his apology to Brittany Higgins following concerns it could affect the trial of the man charged with her alleged rape, stating it was “by no means a reflection on the matters before a court”. The prime minister on Tuesday apologised in parliament to Higgins for the “terrible things that took place” during her time working in Canberra. That prompted a rebuke from Warwick Korn, the lawyer representing the man accused of her rape, Bruce Lehrmann.  Korn told News Corp Australia the prime minister’s comments could reduce the chances of Lehrmann having a fair jury trial. “In light of the complexity, difficulty and importance of the task before any jury already, the behaviour of our prime minister and others in this past 24 hours truly beggars belief,” he said. Morrison’s office subsequently sought to clarify his comments. A spokesperson said on Friday the apology referred generally to “the many terrible experiences Ms Higgins has detailed during her time working at Parliament House and the treatment that she has described receiving whilst working here. This is by no means a reflection on the matters before a court.” The ACT supreme court has set a tentative trial date for June. Lehrmann is accused of raping Higgins in a parliamentary office in 2019 and faces one charge of sexual intercourse without consent. He denies the charge, saying no form of sexual activity took place, and the trial is expected to last three to four weeks. The ACT supreme court no longer allows judge-alone trials for sexual assault cases meaning the matter must go before a jury. The jury selection process and judicial directions are generally used to ensure external commentary and pre-trial publicity does not compromise jurors’ ability to act impartially. The ACT’s director of public prosecutions declined to comment.",News/Australia news,PM clarifies his apology to Brittany Higgins was ‘by no means a reflection on matters before a court’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/11/pm-clarifies-his-apology-to-brittany-higgins-was-by-no-means-a-reflection-on-matters-before-a-court
2/11/2022,"As Cressida Dick confirmed she will be leaving Scotland Yard in the coming weeks, those affected by the controversies during her tenure welcomed her resignation. “The first time I dealt with Cressida Dick was in 2012 and since then all she has done in relation to my family is just delay, obstruct and disappoint on a huge level,” said Alastair Morgan, who has spent decades campaigning for justice for his murdered brother.  The private detective Daniel Morgan was killed with an axe in a pub car park in Sydenham, south-east London, in 1987. The Met was described as “institutionally corrupt” and Dick was personally censured for obstruction by an independent inquiry. Morgan continued: “Although I think it is a shame that we are seeing another commissioner disappear under a cloud of smoke, it is necessary. My only anxiety now is who is going to replace her and face the massive job in front of them of rebuilding confidence in the Met.” Dick has also faced criticism of failure to act on complaints of institutional sexism and misogyny within the Met’s ranks. When Sarah Everard’s killer, a serving Met officer, was sentenced to a whole-life term in September 2021, the Met leadership was mocked for saying that women who were worried about an officer approaching them could wave down a bus. Dick was also criticised for her handling of a vigil held for Everard which resulted in clashes and arrests. Patsy Stevenson, who was detained, said she was pleased Dick had stepped down. She added, however: “We need to focus as well on this not being a token gesture. This does not fix anything, and I just hope that whoever is in charge next understands that radical change needs to be implemented to fix the systemic issues within the Met.” Campaign group Reclaim These Streets, which is bringing a legal challenge against the force over its handling of the vigil, simply tweeted: “Good riddance.” Meanwhile, the feminist group Sisters Uncut said: “Cressida Dick is resigning but she is leaving behind an institution that is rotten to the core.” Other scandals had included the handling of the murders of sisters Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman in a north London park in June 2020. Two PCs who were stationed at the crime scene were jailed for taking photographs of their bodies and sharing them with friends and colleagues on WhatsApp. The force’s apologies were angrily rejected by their family. In her victim impact statement their mother, Mina Smallman, said: “Those police officers felt so safe, so untouchable, that they felt they would take photographs with our murdered daughters.” She also believed racism was a factor in the lack of initial search by the force when the women were reported missing. It also emerged that a Met officer disciplined after an inquiry into misogynistic and racist messages was promoted. Messages about hitting and raping women were shared by up to 19 officers based mainly at Charing Cross police station. Harriet Wistrich, director of the Centre for Women’s Justice charity, said: “There were far too many stories of officers accused of violence and abuse still in their jobs, and of whistleblowers victimised instead of listened to.” Wistrich said Dick “rose to the top of the Met, only to preside over an institution where misogynists, racists and homophobes can hold on to their jobs when they are meant to be tackling crime”. She added: “The problem with Cressida as the first female to rise to the top of the most difficult job in policing is that in order to do so she had to put loyalty to her officers above all else. “Any future leader of the Met must be able to listen to victims and be prepared to tackle the culture of misogyny and racism that pervades the underbelly of Met policing.” Ricky Waumsley, whose partner Daniel Whitworth was murdered by serial killer Stephen Port, also welcomed Dick’s resignation. He said: “When I was let down by the Met police because of their blatant homophobia towards the four victims that Stephen Port killed, and the inquest concluded that the Met failures ‘probably’ contributed to their deaths, I held Cressida accountable for these failures and made a statement that she should ‘resign with immediate effect’, so I am glad.” The former chief crown prosecutor for north-west England Nazir Afzal said that he took “no joy” in calling for Dick to resign on several occasions. He tweeted: “She was an excellent investigator. But she became a human shield for the Govt. The problems in policing are bigger than one person”.",News/UK news,‘It is necessary’: Cressida Dick critics touched by Met police scandals welcome her resignation,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/11/it-is-necessary-cressida-dick-critics-touched-by-met-police-scandals-welcome-her-resignation
