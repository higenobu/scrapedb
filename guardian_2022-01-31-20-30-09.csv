1/31/2022,"When my eldest daughter was just a few months old, I threw her in a carrier and took her on a train to visit my friend, the chorus of Sisters Are Doin’ It For Themselves looping in my head. I arrived, giddy and smug in the notion that my adorable new addition hadn’t disrupted my life one bit, placed her in the crib set up in my friend’s guestroom, put my hand on the doorknob – and that’s when she started to scream. Which she did for the entire night. Twelve hours. Fourteen hours? Could have been 18. I lost count. I’d never seen her so furious. I’d never seen her so continuously awake.  Cradling her hot, red, squalling body in those first few minutes, my instinct was to sing her the lullaby that had become part of our bedtime ritual: Tender Shepherd, from Peter Pan. Tender shepherd, Tender shepherd, Let me help you count your sheep, One in the meadow, Two in the garden, Three in the nursery fast asleep, Fast asleep. It did not have the intended effect. I briefly entertained the idea that my solo singing was unsatisfactory – my husband and I, back in those innocent days of having just one child and not three, would often sing it as a round. My friend came in to help. We sang together. The baby’s skin tone turned from rose to crimson. I banished all helpers from the room, and for the subsequent hours, sang about ruminant animals as my baby wailed. At some point, I realized she’d conked out. But, curled into the fetal position myself, I continued to mumble-whisper-sing, insisting that we’d both remain calm, that everything was going to be OK, that we’d be sleepy sheep soon enough. Lullabies are curious songs, often about unthinkable tragedies and somber realities – babies crashing down in cradles that are strung up in trees, poor darling Clementine who’s lost and gone forever, a troubled love affair that takes someone’s “sunshine” away – many part of a tradition that for centuries had to factor in the commonness of infant death, of a life that was unpredictable and often bleak. Seeking to understand more about the power of my nightly singing ritual to my preschooler amid an unpredictable and often bleak pandemic – my current hodgepodge lineup features Billy Joel’s Lullabye, a lethargic Bushel and a Peck from Guys and Dolls, and Baby Beluga – I headed to the library. There, I found a crispy yellow-paged little book called Lullabies, published in 1930 by one FE Budd, which collects lullabies from 1300 to 1900 and affirms their less-than-cheery heritage in the intro. “The key to which their music is attuned is that of subdued elegiac lament rather than of lyric rapture,” Budd writes. “The spirit that they foster is one of stoical resignation in the face of impending calamity, a quality of mind that enables a man to go through with things even if he sees no prospect of a successful issue.” Sweet dreams! Not that all of them are that rough. But even our modern choices, as I confirmed after an informal poll of friends, are often random and a bit odd. One landed on a Spanish song, Señor Don Gato, for her newborn. It’s about a cat who’s sitting on the roof, where he learns his beloved will marry him. In his excitement, he falls off, dies, and then is resurrected when he smells the fish stand in the market as his funeral procession passes by. Mmm-kay. Another sings The Streets of Laredo to his infant despite him not being a cowboy, or having any cowboys in his lineage. (He’s an engineer.) You don’t have to have a profound connection to a song for it to stick and, on the flip side, lullabies don’t always carry down from generation to generation. I tried Amazing Grace with my child, which my father used to sing to me, and couldn’t get past the “wretch” part without crying – because of the melody? Because of something etched deep in my being that remembers being cradled in my father’s arms? Perhaps it’s that the song is often associated with grief? Dunno, don’t care, I simply can’t end every day weeping. Hence: Raffi. The thing about singing to a child, I learned, is that it’s arguably as important to the singers as it is to the listeners, something we parents should take note of as we seek to quell our raging anxiety. (Just me?) Programs like Carnegie Hall’s Lullaby Project, which pairs parents and parents-to-be with professional artists to write personal lullabies, encourage new parents to sing, sing, sing. Cradling a child and singing is a one-stop-shop for bonding and connection – it involves the kinesthetic, the audio, the visual – and has been shown to support maternal health and child development. And in medical settings, the upsides are obvious: lullabies positively influence cardiac and respiratory function in premature babies, and they lower the heart rates of anxious caregivers, making them a near-zero-cost way to calm distress. “The first sound a person hears before they’re born is the rhythm of the mother’s heartbeat, the whoosh of the womb, and their mother’s voice,” Dr Joanne Loewy told me when I reached her by phone. “There’s neurologic evidence that a mother singing to a baby is the foundation for attachment.” Loewy has served as the director of the Louis Armstrong Center for Music & Medicine at New York’s Mount Sinai hospital for the last 28 years, where she oversees clinical work and research into the importance of musical therapy. One area of study involves what she calls the “song of kin”, which might have been passed down through generations, or be the parents’ wedding song, or a favorite song from childhood. She likened it to a “special ingredient” that, when sung by the parent or any loving caregiver, imparts profound meaning to the child. While what defines a lullaby is complex – they’re often in 6/8 rhythm, but many parents change the rhythm throughout the day, making it jaunty in the morning and more soporific at night – what matters is the act of singing itself, whatever the time. “Cuing into the mood of that child, collaborating, calibrating the music in real time, that’s where communication begins and is sustained,” Loewy said. The effect of singing is so powerful in humans, she told me, that stroke patients who have lost the ability to speak can be moved to sing if they hear a melody they remember, their neural pathways lighting up like a Christmas tree. Alzheimer’s patients, too. As for pandemic-era lullaby singing? “Its potency is much deeper, because there is so much stress in day-to-day action now,” Loewy told me. “The ritual of singing before bed, with those elongated vowels – it can have amazing outcomes.” My preschooler developed a croup-like cough last week that gave her a husky smoker’s rasp and woke her up multiple times per night, hacking away and crying. She kept testing negative for Covid, and yet, as I rushed down the hall to her room in the wee hours, my head would flood with concerns that ranged from the relatively anodyne – how will this upend our schedules? – to the most profound – What if she ends up at the wrong side of the fraction? After getting her some water and wiping her nose, I’d pick her up, cradle her, and sing – for her, yes, but, I now realize, for me, too.

1/31/2022,"In 1961, there were 10 porters working at Testaccio market. Known as facchini, these men and boys were the moving muscles of the market, transporting both the stall structures, which were still unfixed, and fruit and vegetables from warehouses near Monte Testaccio to the market square. Once the market and stalls were set up, it was the work of i facchini to ferry produce from the market to the dozens of trattorie, osterie, pizzerie and tavole calde in Testaccio and beyond. In 1961, Silvio started working alongside his brother. He was 11. Their parents were longstanding vendors; at first, they had a fruit and vegetable stall, then, after the war, a grocery stall. The boys were born into the market universe; everyone knew them and they knew everyone, every bolt and corner, every trattoria kitchen door. It would be a few years before Silvio was considered a facchino, although from the first day he worked as hard as anyone else, proud of his memory, strength and ability to manoeuvre a trolley.  Silvio was still working as a facchino when I moved to Rome 17 years ago. I would see him most days, stacking crates in the market or wheeling his trolley down the middle of the road, always in blue trousers, a canvas jacket with a breast pocket, and a flat cap. I took it as a sign of belonging when he began shouting, “Buongiorno!” to me. The first time we spoke, he was delivering chicory, fluorescent broccoli and the whitest cauliflower to the side door of a trattoria called Felice. I remember because I took a picture of him holding cauliflowers. I also remember an occasion when my son was small and we met Silvio with what seemed an impossible leaning tower of crates filled with artichokes on their way to another trattoria, Perilli. He retired two years ago, but still walks the streets much as he ever did. We meet most days and often chat. He holds the story of 70 years of his market universe, all those interconnected bits. He tells me how, over time, more stalls became fixed with storage, so the work for facchini reduced, even more so when vendors began delivering the goods themselves. Two generations of facchini have passed away, he tells me; he was the last. When we meet, he is often on his way to Perilli, who honour 59 years of well-timed deliveries by offering him lunch three times a week. He was never invited to eat at Felice, he notes. Six decades, all those crates of chicory, broccoli, artichokes, broad beans, peas, potatoes, cauliflower, and not one lunch. As Silvio crosses the piazza to go to Perilli, I come home to make lunch, a cross between cauliflower cheese and potato gratin. This sort of thing is known as sformato in Italy, which means “taken out of the dish”, and refers to a number of easy-going, comforting, vegetable and cheese dishes. Prep 15 minCook 30 minServes 4 4 medium potatoesSalt and black pepper1 medium cauliflower or romanesco cauliflower50g butter50g flour600ml whole milk, warmed (with an onion studded with cloves, if you want)50g parmesan, gratedBreadcrumbs Boil the potatoes whole and unpeeled in salted water until tender, then peel. Trim and break the cauliflower into florets and boil until just tender (keep in mind they are going to bake again). Using your hands, break both the potatoes and cauliflower into small rough chunks. Next, make the bechamel. Heat the butter in a heavy-based pan. As soon as it starts to foam, whisk in the flour, keep whisking steadily for two minutes, then take off the heat. Add a little of the warmed milk and whisk to a smooth paste. Return the pan to the heat, then add the remaining milk, whisking continuously until it almost boils. Season, then lower the heat and simmer, stirring and whisking frequently, for about 10 minutes, until the sauce is thick. Add three-quarters of the grated parmesan. Mix the potatoes and cauliflower with the bechamel, then tip into an ovenproof dish.

1/31/2022,"As California looks back on another wildfire season that razed thousands of homes and threatened thousands of lives, debate in the state has intensified over how to solve the state’s dire housing crisis as the climate grows ever more extreme. Increasingly, environmentalists who have long opposed large-scale housing developments in the state’s wildlands are finding support in the courts.  “There’s a shift taking place,” said Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis at Pomona College. “These developments are raising big questions about how Californians are going to live in a place that constantly burns.” This month, a judge in northern California forced a halt to the Guenoc Valley project, a $1bn proposed development featuring luxury villas flanked by vineyards, a golf course and a polo field, which was to be built atop 16,000 acres of open ranch land, oak woodlands and untouched savannah. The project promised to bring jobs to one of the state’s most impoverished regions. But the judge, siding with the state attorney general and environmentalists, ruled that planners failed to account for how residents and workers would escape in case of a catastrophic blaze. It didn’t help the developers’ case that just months after the project earned initial approvals, the LNU Complex fire barreled through the site – which had also burned 10 other times since the 1950s. Meanwhile, a judge in southern California dealt a blow to a proposal by the Tejon Ranch company to build 19,300 houses across windy wildlands north of Los Angeles, allowing legal challenges from two environmental groups to advance. It’s just the latest setback for Tejon’s Centennial development, which was first pitched two decades ago as a solution to California’s housing crisis but has been tied up in litigation ever since. The Tejon Ranch company had recently settled with the non-profit Climate Resolve. But two other environmental non-profits, the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) and the California Native Plant Society, have continued their opposition. The Tejon project, said CBD attorney JP Rose, is of another era. The company should have to explain “why they should build this project in light of what we now know about wildfire risk, and the climate crisis”, he said. In a state still reeling from the tragedies of 2017’s Tubb’s fire, 2018’s Camp fire and 2020’s North Complex fire, the top prosecutor has agreed. Before leaving the post to join the Biden administration, former attorney general Xavier Becerra joined CBD’s lawsuit against the Guenoc Valley development, as well as lawsuits against two developments in the hilly, highly combustible scrublands of San Diego county. Such challenges have been bolstered by a 2018 change in the California Environmental Quality Act that now requires developers to take wildfire risks into account in building plans. California’s current attorney general, Rob Bonta, appears to remain dedicated to the cause. “Local governments and developers have a responsibility to take a hard look at projects that exacerbate wildfire risk and endanger our communities,” Bonta said after the Guenoc Valley ruling. “We must build responsibly.” Nearly 95% of fires in California are started by humans and human infrastructure, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire). An overheated vehicle, a faulty electrical line, a carelessly discarded cigarette, could easily spark a blaze. On warm, windy days, under the right conditions, fire will find a way and “housing is an accelerant,” said Miller, the Ponoma College professor. The legal challenges are a sign that California developers will have to start rethinking how they account for fire risks, Miller added. The developers of the Guenoc Valley proposal said their project would include fire breaks, fire cameras and safe zones – none of which fully reassured critics. As part of its settlement with Climate Resolve, Tejon had agreed to build three new fire stations and upgrade an existing one. But developers are not paying to keep up and staff these stations, said Stephanie Pincetl, a professor at UCLA’s Institute of the Environment and Sustainability. Over the past few fire seasons, as several, simultaneous megafires seared through the west, fire crews have repeatedly found themselves overstretched and struggling. “Fire stations are great. Fire stations are absolutely necessary,” said Pincetl. “But on their own, they’re not necessarily enough to contain a large, Santa Ana wind-driven wildfire.” Despite the setbacks, the idea of propagating California’s last remaining expanses of open land with houses, particularly as the state grapples with an acute housing shortage, holds a strong appeal. At the flanks of the Tehachapi mountains, Tejon Ranch is the largest private landholding in California. Spanning 422 sq miles, it is nearly as big as the city of Los Angeles, and as Tejon has repeatedly proffered – a prime spot to build. Tejon Ranch’s vice-president of communications Barry Zoeller said the company would “continue to aggressively defend” the approval of the project, “given the desperate need for new housing in California”. Of the 19,300 proposed housing units the company has planned, 3,500 will be affordable housing, according to its proposal. “In addressing the housing crisis, infill – building more density into already-developed areas – is always the better way to start,” said Chris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. “On the other hand, I’m not sure that fire risk should always be used as a cudgel to beat down housing proposals.” In some cases, and in some especially fire-prone areas, the hazard may indeed be too great. “But that doesn’t mean that there are no developments in fire-prone areas that make sense,” Field said. For Climate Resolve, one motivation to settle with Tejon Ranch was the sense that it was “important to try to find common ground between developers and environmentalists”, said Jonathan Parfrey, the group’s executive director. “California currently has a housing crisis and it has a climate crisis.” In that vein, the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, in 2020 vetoed a bill that would have directed cities and counties to account for evacuation routes and raised fees to cover the costs of clearing flammable vegetation before approving new constructions, saying that the legislation would conflict with the state’s goals of quickly building new housing. Critics say pitting housing goals against fire and climate crisis concerns creates a false dichotomy. “We know that under the right conditions, houses will burn, and people will be faced with the tragedy of losing their houses, their livelihoods and potentially their lives,” said Jensen of the Native Plant Society. “Are these projects really worth it?”",News/World news,Where to build in a state on fire?

1/31/2022,"When Iona stepped into the hairdressing salon in 2019, she was hoping for a fresh look after a break-up. “I was going for the new hair, new me thing,” she says. “There was a bit of summer left and I thought I could still be hot and sexy.” She had been going to the same salon for a few years, but usually had her hair cut by a female stylist. “She wasn’t working when I wanted to go, so they booked me in with JP instead as he was the only stylist free,” she says. When Iona arrived, she was struck by how attractive JP was. They chatted as he cut her hair, bonding over their shared love of music. “I’d seen her around before,” says JP. “I remember thinking she was beautiful. We realised we’d been at the same small festival in France earlier that summer. It turned out we’d been in the same room quite a few times, but never spoken.”  JP had recently come out of a relationship and had been looking forward to being single for a while. But he couldn’t resist the spark he felt with Iona. “Love finds you when you’re not looking for it,” he says. “It was like meeting my long-lost best friend.” She told him that she ran her own business as a florist, which impressed him. “I found her so motivated and ambitious. There was a lot of synergy and it felt very right.” He told Iona that he was living with his mum and she suspected that was code for “recently single”. “I was pleased,” she says. “He was an open book, like me, and we got along really well.” When she left the salon, she gave a note with her phone number to the receptionist, asking her to pass it on to JP. “He had given me a cute blunt bob, so it said: ‘Thanks for making me look like a French film star. Call me’ – but it was a few days before he called. He made me sweat!” They arranged a trip to a Thai restaurant in Peckham, south London, the following week. JP admits he was “incredibly nervous” as he hadn’t been on a date for a long time. “At first, it was awkward and I thought I’d made a massive mistake,” says Iona. “I wondered where the open, chatty guy I met at the hairdressers had gone. But after a few drinks he loosened up and we had a great time.” A few days later, they went on a second date and became a couple. Although they both worked long hours, they went out to dinner whenever they could and spent their free time driving around listening to music or going on trips out of London. In January 2020, JP moved into Iona’s east London flat. When lockdown hit, she continued to post orders from her flower shop, while JP found temporary work at a factory while the salon was closed. By April, Iona was pregnant and that summer the couple moved to a bigger house in Beckenham, south-east London. In September, JP opened his own salon. “It was a big risk at a volatile time but it has paid off,” he says. “And Iona always supported me 200%.” They married a year later at a register office. “It was just us and we went for lunch at the River Cafe afterwards,” says Iona. “We’ll have a big party in a few years.” Their son arrived on Christmas Eve 2020 and Iona is pregnant with their second child. As well as having lots of shared interests and values, Iona loves JP’s patience. “He’s such a steady, stable influence. He puts up with me being really erratic sometimes,” she laughs. “He’s also a great dad and husband.” JP finds his wife’s motivation inspiring. “She’s lived abroad and done so much at such a young age,” he says. “Now I see what an incredible mother she is and what a supportive energy she is in my life. She always believes in me.” Want to share your story? Tell us a little about yourself, your partner and how you got together by filling in the form here.

1/31/2022,"A British woman accused of fabricating claims of being gang-raped in a holiday resort on Cyprus has had the conviction overturned by the Mediterranean island’s supreme court. Two years after the then teenager received a suspended four-month sentence for fomenting public mischief, the tribunal threw out the case, acknowledging she had not been given a fair trial.  “This is a watershed moment,” said Michael Polak of the legal aid group Justice Abroad, who had coordinated the appeal against the conviction. “Not just for our client who has always maintained her innocence even when doing so caused her the hardship of not being able to return home during the lengthy trial proceedings, but also for others round the world in similar positions.” The student, who is now 21, had claimed she was ganged-raped by up to 12 Israelis in a hotel room in Ayia Napa in July 2019. She had threatened to go to the European court of human rights if the attempt to clear her name before Cyprus’ supreme court had failed. The guilty verdict had hinged on a written confession in which the teenager had withdrawn the complaint but which her defence team argued was extracted under duress in the absence of a lawyer or translator after eight hours of police questioning. Although not in Nicosia for the verdict, the young woman, who has never been publicly identified, welcomed the outcome in a statement issued by her mother. “It is a great relief we hear that the authorities in Cyprus have recognised the flaws in their legal process,” the statement said. “Whilst this decision doesn’t excuse the way she was treated by the police, or the judge or those in authority, it does bring with it the hope that my daughter’s suffering will at least bring positive changes in the way victims of crime are treated.”",News/World news,UK woman accused of making up Cyprus gang-rape claims has conviction quashed,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/uk-woman-accused-making-up-cyprus-gang-claims-conviction-quashed
1/31/2022,"Good morning. A sweeping new bill with powerful bipartisan support in the US Senate would establish an inquiry into the country’s Covid-19 response similar to the 9/11 Commission, among other provisions aimed at preventing the next pandemic.  The new Covid commission would inform the US response to future outbreaks as well as the current impact of the disease. The bill will be co-sponsored by Senator Patty Murray of Washington and Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, who plan to mark it up in committee in the coming weeks. “The pain of this pandemic is unforgettable, and we have a responsibility to make sure its lessons are unforgettable, too,” Murray said. The legislation, called the Prevent Pandemics Act, would lay the groundwork to enshrine new powers in federal health agencies. In November 2019, the US was ranked first of 195 countries for pandemic preparedness in a report co-produced by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, but it has consistently had one of the worst responses to the Covid-19 pandemic, said John Farmer Jr, the senior counsel for the 9/11 Commission. The leaders of the Senate foreign relations committee said yesterday they were on the verge of approving “the mother of all sanctions” against Vladimir Putin, warning there would be no appeasement as the Russian president contemplates an invasion of Ukraine. “We cannot have a Munich moment again,” the panel’s Democratic chair, Bob Menendez of New Jersey, told CNN’s State of the Union, referring to the 1938 agreement by which allies ceded parts of Czechoslovakia to Hitler, believing it would stave off war. “Putin will not stop if he believes the west will not respond,” Menendez said. “We saw what he did in 2008 in Georgia, we saw what he did in 2014 in pursuit of Crimea. He will not stop.” Menendez said he believed bipartisan negotiations for severe sanctions were “on the one-yard line”, despite disagreements with Republicans over whether measures should be imposed before or after any Russian invasion. The UK government promised to ramp up sanctions against Putin and his associates. What’s going to happen next? There is expected to be a UN security council meeting today, at the request of the US, to give Russia the opportunity to explain its actions. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, said the US was “prepared to listen” but was “not going to be distracted by their propaganda”. What’s happening on the ground? Tensions on the Ukraine border have continued to escalate, with Reuters reporting the Russian military build-up included supplies of blood in anticipation of casualties. It has been a long and painful month in the Florida legislature for opponents of the state’s Trumpist governor, Ron DeSantis, and his loyal band of rightwing Republicans, writes Richard Luscombe. A slew of bills has advanced attacking everything from diversity rights to abortion protections and free speech in schools, in addition to a proposal that would legally shield white people from feeling “discomfort” over the state’s racist past. Last Wednesday, an anti-masker physician, handpicked by the governor and apathetic about the value of Covid-19 vaccines, was backed unanimously by a Republican senate panel as the next surgeon-general after a walkout by Democratic politicians frustrated by Joseph Ladapo’s evasiveness. To hear DeSantis tell it, the “freedom state” of Florida is merely following the will of a populist citizenry in defying the perceived tyranny of the federal government, determined to protect liberty in the face of a deadly pandemic that has claimed more than 64,000 of their fellow residents, and standing up against the “indoctrination” of children. DeSantis is finding opposition beginning to harden. Those voices come from parents, doctors, LBGTQ+ activists, proponents of voting rights and others who will be affected if many of the Republican bills, as expected, become law. A booming online industry specialising in fake passports with official visas and travel stamps is offering people with links to Islamic State the opportunity to leave Syria and travel onwards to the US, EU, Canada and the UK, a Guardian investigation has found. The US east coast fell into a deep freeze on Sunday after a powerful nor’easter dumped mounds of snow, flooded coastlines and knocked out power to tens of thousands of people. The weather may have contributed to at least four deaths in New York, all on Long Island. Donald Trump’s promise to pardon supporters who attacked the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 was “the stuff of dictators”, Richard Nixon’s White House counsel said. Trump made the promise at a rally in Conroe, Texas, on Saturday. The United Nations says it has received “credible allegations” that more than 100 extrajudicial killings have been carried out in Afghanistan despite Taliban assurances of safety. Those killed include members of the ousted Afghan government, its security forces and those who worked with international troops. As modern life has grown more distanced through technological innovation, our opportunities for deep, intimate moments have dwindled. Millions of people worldwide are isolated and lonely, woefully lacking in the meaningful and diverse social experiences that help support emotional and physical health. The pandemic has only exacerbated this trend, prohibiting or impeding many types of friendly and professional touch and sending many of us deeper into our online worlds. This has left many of us starving. We’ve entered an intimacy famine. Studies have shown that low-level physical activity and meditation practice that uses gentle stretching such as yoga or tai chi can help with sleep quality. And while it is good to stretch at any time of day, establishing a gentle and quiet routine before bed can help send a signal to the brain that it is time for sleep. Best of all, stretching doesn’t require money. Tilting menus towards plant-based meals significantly cuts the amount of meat eaten, according to research. The experiments in work and university cafeterias showed making it easier to choose meat-free food can be effective and could be a more acceptable approach than other proposals, such as taxing meat or banning it on certain days. Meat production is an important driver of the climate crisis, and substantial falls in meat consumption are needed in rich nations to curb global heating. The US weather service has warned Florida residents that immobilised iguanas could fall out of trees due to unusually cold temperatures across the region. “Iguanas are cold-blooded. They slow down or become immobile when temps drop into the 40s [4-9C],” the US National Weather Service Miami-South Florida said on Twitter on Sunday. “They may fall from trees, but they are not dead.” South Florida temperatures reached a low of 25F [-3.9C] on Sunday morning, according to the weather service.

1/31/2022,"Even in the context of the UK media’s famously curious coverage of everyday cycling, this was a surprise. Away from the more familiar tabloid cries of a “battle” over changes to the Highway Code, tucked away in the sober enclave of the Times’s editorial pages something odd was happening. It was near the bottom of a leader column on cycling that a paper which, less than a decade ago, launched the most concerted and effective media campaign for safe cycling seen in this country for years, decided in effect to declare war on those who opt for two-wheeled transport.  It was, the column noted, beyond doubt that drivers should have licences, insurance and number plates for their vehicles. Then came the follow-up: “Requiring the same of cyclists is fair.” This was a triple-whammy, the full bingo card, the complete Littlejohn, the title that still styles itself the country’s newspaper of record formally declaring that it no longer wants to see cyclists on the roads. Of course, it wasn’t phrased so directly, but if you argue for such measures, that is in effect what you want. Any of those regulatory handcuffs being applied to bikes, let alone all three, would be so unwieldy, so counter-productive, so utterly, utterly pointless that pretty much no country or territory has ever attempted it, and the few that did generally gave up quite quickly. If the UK enforced these measures fully and with gusto, my guess is that somewhere between 50% and 75% of cycle traffic would vanish. And yes, this is a guess. There is no real data to base it on – because no one has been so stupid as to try it. The arguments against such regulatory tangles for cycling have been made many times before and don’t need repeating in full, but let’s just think about a couple of the potential hiccups. Consider children. Would they need to take a test and have insurance? If so, from what age? Some kids ride on the roads, with their parents, when they’ve five. Good luck giving them a multiple choice test on the Highway Code. And if under-18s are exempt, how do you enforce rules for teenagers? Would a 16-year-old have to carry ID when out on a bike to prove their age? Secondly: number plates for bikes. Anything light and small enough would be too small to read beyond a distance of a few metres. And what of people [holds up an apologetic hand] with multiple bikes? Would we have to register each one, or transfer plates between them? This is the point at which someone usually suggests riders wear a numbered, hi-vis tabard. One both light enough to wear on a 100-mile ride in mid-summer, but also big enough to go over the winter coat of someone cycling to work in the snow? And that’s assuming the commuter doesn’t have a bag on his or her back. You could go on, almost endlessly, which is why, when asked about such ideas, UK ministers and officials, in common with just about everybody else who has given the idea more than 90 seconds of thought, dismiss them. Cycling for transport is an undisputed social good – even the Times editorial concedes that. So why argue for all this? The Times, almost insultingly, doesn’t even try to square the circle, merely saying, without any attempt at elaboration: “The objection that it would deter legitimate cycling is not persuasive.” Instead we get this very odd sentence: “The road network is a service available to everyone, and it is reasonable to expect those who benefit from it to abide by its regulation and contribute to its upkeep.” Ignoring the intellectual howler of “contribute to its upkeep” – it is embarrassing for the Times to have got that one so wrong – we at last come to the crux of the argument, such as it is: “fairness”. It is the cry more usually seen in the murky depths of reader comments or the fringes of Twitter arguments: drivers face all sorts of regulations to use the roads, what’s so different about cyclists? One response would be: if you use a table saw and a screwdriver for the same wood-based DIY project, and you don goggles, ear protection and a mask for the saw, why don’t you for the screwdriver? That’s right – one is notably more dangerous than the other. Again, the statistics are well known. Of the 1,700 or so deaths and 25,000-plus serious injuries on the UK’s roads every year, only a handful are caused by a cyclist hitting someone else. To stress yet another well-worn point: it’s not about morals, it’s just physics. If I hit a pedestrian while doing 20mph in a Range Rover I would impart 25 times more kinetic energy than at the same speed on my bike. If you make the speeds more realistic – bike at 12mph, car doing 30mph – then the difference is 150 times. What should we make of the Times’s sudden outbreak of idiocy? It’s hard to know. It would be nice to think this is the response of a dinosaur class who realise history is against them. But even in the context of the UK’s cursed media narrative on everyday active transport, it is deeply depressing.",News/Environment,Has the Times declared war on cyclists?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2022/jan/31/the-times-editorial-cycling-licences
1/31/2022,"Schools are closed and train services disrupted after two storms battered parts of the UK and left more than 100,000 people without power. Winds of up to 92mph were recorded in northern parts of the UK over the weekend as the storms Malik and Corrie hurtled in from the Atlantic.  Thousands of homes remained without power on Monday morning, mostly in north-east England and Scotland, while trains between Edinburgh and Newcastle were among services cancelled. Northern Powergrid said about 80,000 of its customers were affected by power cuts across the weekend, with about 4,000 still without power. Paul Glendinning, a director at Northern Powergrid, said: “We are within sight of the end. But we still have a lot to do to get the last 4,000 customers reconnected having confirmed that around 200 damage points remain. Restoring these smaller incidents reconnects only a small number of customers for each job.” A further 22,450 people were without power in parts of Scotland and north-west England, according to SP Energy Networks, which said all but 230 households had been reconnected in its latest update on Sunday. The back-to-back storms were linked to two deaths over the weekend, after a nine-year-old boy in Staffordshire and a 60-year-old woman in Aberdeen died after being hit by falling trees on Saturday. Storm Malik was named by the Danish Meteorological Institute and Corrie by the UK Met Office. The Met Office lists storms alphabetically but skips Q, U, X, Y and Z to comply with international storm-naming conventions and to maintain consistency for official storm naming in the North Atlantic. Several schools in Aberdeenshire and Northumberland said they would be shut or would delay opening on Monday. The Environment Agency warned that flooding was expected along parts of the south-east coast, around Felixstowe in Suffolk and near Tilbury in Essex, owing to high tides caused by Storm Corrie. There was major travel disruption across England and Scotland as operators including ScotRail, London North Eastern Railway, CrossCountry and TransPennine Express cancelled or suspended services on Monday morning. Network Rail said it was carrying out safety checks in an effort to reopen the line. These include monitoring overhead electric wires to ensure they have not been damaged in the severe weather and running trains to check for debris on tracks. The organisation said its staff had faced “an exceptionally challenging weekend with two significant storms bringing severe weather”. Storm Malik caused disruption on Saturday before the arrival of Storm Corrie on Sunday. Passenger trains between Edinburgh and Newcastle will initially be required to run at slower speeds than normal even once the line reopens, leading to further delays to journeys. Much of the ScotRail network has been affected by the severe weather. The operator warned passengers on Monday it had been able to arrange only “very limited replacement transport”. Storm Corrie pushed into the North Sea in the early hours of Monday, leaving cold and blustery conditions behind.",News/UK news,Storms Malik and Corrie disrupt schools and rail services across UK,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/31/schools-rail-services-disrupted-uk-storms-malik-and-corrie
1/31/2022,"Federal Labor says Snowy Hydro could proceed with building a new power plant in the Hunter Valley if it wins the upcoming election – but insists the plant should be powered entirely by green hydrogen, instead of gas, by 2030. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, and the shadow climate change minister, Chris Bowen, are expected to make the announcement during a campaign visit to the electorate of Paterson on Tuesday.  Guardian Australia understands Labor wants the proposed gas “peaking” plant to be powered by 30% hydrogen at the time it becomes operational and 50% by 2025 and 100% by 2030. The Morrison government’s decision to spend up to $600m on the Kurri Kurri gas-fired plant has been widely criticised since it was announced by the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, in May last year. Billed as part of the Morrison government’s promised “gas-fired recovery” from the pandemic, the plant was promised to be turned on only when needed to fill gaps in the market. Documents lodged with the NSW government show Snowy Hydro expects it will run at 2% of its full capacity annually. While this is not uncommon for “peaking” gas plants, analysts have said the plant was not needed to maintain electricity supply and did not “stack up” commercially given the range of cheaper and cleaner alternatives in development. Others have said the government interfering in the electricity market was likely to further discourage the huge private investment needed to deliver new power generation over the coming decades. Gas is a fossil fuel that releases about half the emissions of coal when burned but contributes more to global heating once methane that leaks during extraction is factored in. Taylor has suggested the plant could also use some hydrogen blended in with the gas to lower its greenhouse emissions. Snowy Hydro’s environment impact statement for the project said there was potential for this in the future, should hydrogen become economically viable, but it would require the plant to be modified at an increased cost. The billionaire Andrew Forrest has been more bullish about the possibility of blending green hydrogen – made with renewable energy – with gas for use in power plants. His company Squadron Energy is promising a 660 MW gas-hydrogen generator – roughly the same size as the Kurri Kurri station – at Port Kembla at an estimated cost of $1.3bn, including $30m in federal funding to help make it hydrogen compatible. The company says the plant will be capable of running on 50% green hydrogen when first turned on, with a goal of increasing that to 100% by 2030. Some international analysts have suggested electricity generation is likely to be among the least economically viable uses of hydrogen should an industry develop on the scale some have predicted. The National party is targeting Labor-held seats in the Hunter Valley in NSW, hoping to recruit voters disaffected by Labor’s more ambitious climate change policy commitments. Retiring Labor veteran Joel Fitzgibbon, who suffered a significant voter backlash in his Hunter electorate in the 2019 election, has spent much of this term warning Labor will lose another election if it pursues ambitious climate commitments at the expense of regional jobs in traditional industries. With a decision to pursue the controversial Snowy plant, but require that the peaker run on hydrogen rather than gas, Labor is attempting to walk a line between supporting a new development in the Hunter region, but not supporting the lock-in of fossil fuel-fired electricity. Taylor has argued the Kurri Kurri plant is needed to avoid a significant increase in wholesale electricity prices when the Liddell coal-fired plant shuts in 2023.",News/Australia news,Labor to support $600m Kurri Kurri power plant but only if it runs on green hydrogen by 2030,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/31/labor-to-support-600m-kurri-kurri-power-plant-but-only-if-it-runs-on-green-hydrogen-by-2030
1/31/2022,"Myanmar’s military junta has threatened sedition and terrorism charges against anyone who shuts their business, claps or bang pots on Tuesday, as it tries to stamp out any protests planned to mark the one-year anniversary of the coup. The military, which ousted the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on 1 February 2021, continues to face defiant opposition including peaceful protests and an armed resistance.  On Tuesday, activists plan to hold a “silent strike” and have called for members of the public to stay at home between 10am and 4pm. At the end of the strike, people will clap or bang pots, an act that is traditionally thought to drive out evil spirits, and which is often used as a form of protest against the military. The junta has warned the public not to participate in such protests, announcing in junta-controlled media that people who do so will face a variety of legal charges. Over the past week, business owners have been sent notices from local administrators, reiterating such threats, and warning their property could be confiscated. They have been required to sign a document to pledge their agreement. Some shop owners who had told customers that their businesses will be closed on 1 February have already been arrested, according to local media outlet the Irrawaddy. Many businesses are proposing getting around the military threats by dramatically raising prices, opening only for a few hours and closing for “lunch break”, or keeping their store open but not selling items. In February 2021, Myanmar's progress towards democracy was brutally stalled when the military seized power and took control of the country.   In the year since, the country has been plunged into violence, poverty and mass displacement as the military attempts to crush widespread resistance to its rule.  Internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, a ruthless curtailing of freedom of speech and escalating military attacks on civilian areas have silenced the voices of people from Myanmar.   For this special series, the Guardian’s Rights and freedom project has partnered with a diverse group of journalists from Myanmar, many working in secret, to bring their reporting on life under military rule to a global audience. Journalists in Myanmar are working in dangerous and difficult circumstances, as the military government attacks the free press and shuts down local media outlets. Many reporters still inside the country fear arrest, with others forced to leave their homes and go into hiding in areas increasingly under attack from military forces.  All the reporting in this series will be carried out by journalists from Myanmar, with support from the editors on the Rights and freedom project. These are the stories that journalists from Myanmar want to tell about what is happening to their country at this critical moment. Aung Kaung Sett, president of Yangon University Student Union, who led mass protests in Yangon in the wake of the coup and is now in hiding, said the public would not abandon the struggle for democracy. “There is no turning back now. We live or we die,” he said. “The revolution must continue, whatever it takes.” While military violence means it is no longer safe to hold large street rallies, and leaders such as Aung San Suu Kyi remain in prison, new forms of protests continue, led by a new generation of activists. “There are guerrilla protests led by young people, especially students, poets and activists, across everywhere in Myanmar,” Aung Kaung Sett said. He said the coup had dramatically changed public opinion of the Myanmar military, which is known as the Tatmadaw. “People are beginning to feel the same way now as those who had faced oppression by the Myanmar military in the past,” he said, citing the brutal crackdown on Rohingya Muslims in 2017, and atrocities committed against other ethnic minorities. There was previously little sympathy towards minorities within Myanmar, but attitudes have shifted as the public has united in opposition to the military. The military has announced it will hold market festivals and a cycling contest in both Yangon and Mandalay from Monday until Wednesday, in an attempt to crowd the streets on the day of the Silent Strike and project an image of normalcy. However, one year on from the coup, the country is in a state of turmoil. Public services, such as health and education, have collapsed because many medical and teaching staff refuse to work in junta-controlled facilities and so are operating in the community. The economy is failing, with the UN estimating the crisis will have driven almost half the population into poverty in 2022. According to the World Food Programme, the cost of a basic food basket was almost a third higher in October 2021 when compared with the month prior to the coup. Fuel prices have surged more than 70%. The military has also inflicted extreme violence to suppress opposition, burning villages, launching airstrikes, carrying out massacres and blocking aid to civilians. Since the coup, 1,499 people have been killed, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which tracks deaths and arrests. At least 11,801 people have been arrested. There are widespread reports of torture within detention facilities. Many young people have fled to the jungle and resorted to taking up arms and forming people’s defence forces. Among them is Costa, 21, who, prior to the coup, was studying International Relations at Yangon University. She is now in charge of managing finances for a battalion of the Karenni National Defence Force in Kayah state. “We will continue to ask for what we want: to abolish the 2008 constitution [which guaranteed the military huge powers, even during the governments of Aung San Suu Kyi], restore democracy and end dictatorship, even if it takes 10 years,” she said. Worsening conflict between the junta and its opponents has forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes, especially in the south-east and north-west of the country. As of 27 December, an estimated 320,900 people remained internally displaced across Myanmar, according to the United Nations. This is in addition to the 340,000 people who were already displaced before the coup. David Carden, the head of UN OCHA Myanmar, said the people of Myanmar faced “an unprecedented political, human rights and humanitarian crisis that is now touching all corners of the country, posing grave protection risks for civilians, limiting access to services and driving deeper food insecurity”. Many of the people who were displaced were living in the open or sheltering in the jungle. Humanitarian access remains severely restricted, Carden added. International efforts to ease the crisis have been criticised by activists as inadequate. Ismail Wolff, regional director of the group Fortify Rights, described the response as “ineffective and incompetent”. “The [UN] security council must take the lead by passing a binding resolution enforcing an arms embargo on the Myanmar military … More pressure should also be applied to Thailand and India to authorise a comprehensive cross-border humanitarian aid effort,” Wolff said.",News/Global development,Myanmar’s junta threatens protesters planning coup anniversary action,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/31/myanmars-junta-threatens-protesters-planning-coup-anniversary-action
