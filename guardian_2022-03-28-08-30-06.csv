3/28/2022,"Major investors have launched a campaign calling for Sainsbury’s to help tackle the cost of living crisis by becoming the first supermarket group to pay all its workers the “real living wage” of £9.90 an hour. Legal & General Investment Management, Nest (National Employment Savings Trust), which is Britain’s largest workplace pension scheme, and several MPs have formed a coalition to push for the change after reports that increasing numbers of supermarket workers are having to turn to food banks to feed themselves and their families. The group of investors – whose institutional members manage £2.2tn of assets – will file a shareholder resolution on Monday calling for Sainsbury’s to accredit as a living wage employer. The resolution will be put to the vote at the Sainsbury’s annual general meeting, planned for 7 July. The group said it would be writing to all UK supermarkets urging them to take the same action. Set by the Living Wage Foundation, the nationwide real living wage is currently £9.90, while in London it is £11.05. This is set to rise in November and compares with the statutory minimum wage of £8.91, which rises to £9.50 on 1 April. About 9,000 or more employers have adopted the voluntary pay measure, including half of the FTSE 100 and some prominent retailers such as Ikea and Lush, but no UK supermarket has yet signed up. Despite official recognition of their status as key workers during the pandemic, supermarket staff continue to be one of the largest groups of low-paid workers in Britain, according to the investor campaign group ShareAction, which is coordinating the resolution. Sainsbury’s is the UK’s second largest food retailer. It operates more than 600 supermarkets and 800 convenience stores, and in January it said it expected to report underlying profits of at least £720m for the financial year to March 2022 – £60m more than it had previously thought. Last year the retailer came under fire from some quarters when it emerged that its chief executive, Simon Roberts, was awarded a pay package totalling more than £1.3m for 2020-21. At the same time, many supermarket workers have been struggling to keep their heads above water. Research conducted by the Organise network found that one in three Sainsbury’s workers regularly worried about putting food and drink on the table. Sainsbury’s is paying more than some rivals: earlier this year it announced an increase in basic hourly pay for all employees. It lifted rates for directly employed staff from £9.50 to £10 an hour outside London, and matched the living wage rate for employees in inner London. Asda, meanwhile, was criticised last month by the GMB union for imposing a below-inflation pay increase that means its staff will earn £9.66 an hour from April, while Tesco’s current hourly rate is £9.55. However, ShareAction said the new Sainsbury’s rate of £10.50 for workers in outer London was “considerably lower” than the £11.05 real living wage for the region. On top of that, it added, Sainsbury’s had not made any commitment relating to the pay of third-party staff such as cleaners and security guards, or any pledge that wages would continue to increase in line with the cost of living in future years. The shareholder resolution calls on the retailer to remove this uncertainty by becoming a living wage-accredited employer by July 2023. It is thought to be the first resolution calling for a listed firm to take this step. Individual shareholders backing the resolution include the Labour MPs Siobhain McDonagh and Helen Hayes. Sainsbury’s, which directly employs more than 189,000 workers, said that in recognition of the “extraordinary work” its staff do, it had this month increased its basic hourly rate by 5.3%. A spokesperson said: “We pay more than many of our competitors, and across the board colleague feedback has been positive to our pay review … Our competitive pay rates are in addition to our colleague discount programme, matching pension scheme and recently enhanced family leave policy. “As we balance the needs of all our stakeholders, particularly in the light of the current cost of living challenges that many people in the UK face, it is vital that we not only pay our colleagues fairly but that we are able to invest significantly to offer customers great value.”",News/UK news,Investors call for Sainsbury’s to pay workers ‘real living wage’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/28/investors-call-for-sainsburys-to-pay-workers-real-living-wage
3/28/2022,"Psychodrama is described as a love letter to storytelling by its creators, Christopher Brett Bailey and the experimental theatre company, Sleepwalk Collective. This production certainly innovates in the delivery of the story, which is transmitted to us through headphones as its two performers speak their feverish, non-sequitur tale into microphones. Bailey and iara Solano Arana, sit at a desk, looking and sounding as if they have stumbled out of a David Lynch film. They play lovers on the road and out to kill. They wear period wigs, circa 18th-century France (designed by Katie Du’Mont) along with 21st-century dress, which makes them look like modern disciples of the Marquis de Sade. “Breathe deeply and slowly,” says Bailey, settling us into the story to come which at first has the ring of a guided meditation or hypnotic recording designed to take us into an altered state. The duo encourage us to “calibrate” ourselves for a story that could be considered “foreplay” and speak of a “safe space” but it seems to be the very opposite as we enter their nocturnal and noirish inner world, filled with explicit descriptions of sex and violence. It feels like falling into a vortex of nightmarish scenarios as they speak of a murderous pact, dead bodies and dismembered limbs, especially those of women. The violence seems to aspire to critique the voyeuristic tropes of true crime podcasts and beyond, but feels gratuitous, and without enough meaningful commentary, satire or subversion: “I dildo myself to oblivion with the severed limb,” says Arana, as she speaks of pushing further into the violence as a way of exploring it. But there is only ever an endless stream of disturbing images with no greater context or coherent argument. The graphic sex too, though clearly overplayed and cartoonish – from sweat to glutinous white spurts, congealed menstrual blood and “puddles of cum” – again feel unnecessary even in the presumed attempt to send up such pornographic narratives. When intestines are described to come out of an “asshole” in one sex act, it really does veer into Marquis de Sade territory. Bailey fellates a dildo while Arana writhes on the floor with her legs in the air, like an upturned beetle, and there is the discomforting feeling that we are watching this scene for their pleasure, indulging the bizarre experimental excess. The ambient music and sound design (by Bailey and Sammy Metcalfe) is the strongest aspect of the production, along with Metcalfe’s moody lighting. There is real verbal dexterity to the script too, and a heady delirium in its delivery, but it feels excessive and unharnessed as we drift from one vision to the next. Even if this production replicates the form of a dream, it does not satisfy as a performance, it is too disjointed and draining, its weirdness outdoing even David Lynch  At Battersea Arts Centre, London, until 9 April.",Arts/Stage,Psychodrama review – noirish inner world of murderous lovers is disjointed and draining,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/28/psychodrama-review-battersea-arts-centre-london
3/28/2022,"Plans to redraw England’s schools system will allow councils to establish their own academy trusts and give schools the opportunity to leave failing ones. The policies are set out in a schools white paper to be published on Monday and include a “parent pledge” for families to request additional support for their children, which has been dismissed as a “gimmick” by school leaders. Central to the white paper is a push for academy trusts to take over the running of schools in England, with a 2030 target date for converting council-maintained schools into academies and for them to have joined or be preparing to join a multi-academy trust (Mat). The white paper also calls for a regulatory review of Mats, potentially paving the way for an independent regulator of school trusts and their operations. Academies are state-funded schools with higher degrees of autonomy in governance, use of resources and curriculum. But recently the number of schools converting to academy status has slowed, with a majority of primary schools and a fifth of secondary schools retaining their links to local authorities. Provisions in the white paper would allow local authorities to establish Mats and gain powers to encourage schools to join a Mat “where that is the right approach for local schools”, in areas lacking high-performing Mats. Councils may also be given significant new powers to force academies to accept children who are without a school place. Ministers say the change would help overcome the objections of the remaining maintained and voluntary-aided schools to becoming academies, and streamline England’s complicated school governance system. Lucy Nethsingha, of the children and young people board at the Local Government Association, said: “We are pleased government has acted on our call for councils to be allowed to set up their own Mats. Councils have an excellent track record in providing a high-quality education for pupils, with 92% of maintained schools rated by Ofsted as outstanding or good – a higher proportion than any other type of school.” The white paper will also include new ways to regulate academy trusts, and policies to encourage standalone academies to join established Mats, in a further streamlining that would reduce the number of trusts running single schools. Matt Dunkley, the director of children’s services for Kent county council, said: “Streamlining of the current fragmented school system is well overdue, and we appreciate the proposals to match local authorities’ responsibilities as system leaders with the appropriate powers to meet those responsibilities.” One of the most significant new policies for school leaders would allow schools to switch between Mats by appealing to the new regulator. Currently, schools are unable to leave Mats unless they are “rebrokered” by the Department for Education (DfE) in extreme circumstances, such as the financial collapse of a Mat. The white paper aims for more schools to join what it defines as “strong” multi-academy trusts, based on quality, inclusivity and measures of improvement. The DfE said the white paper would include a new pledge to every parent that schools will intervene if their children fall behind in English or maths. The pledge will mean schools are to identify children who need help and keep parents informed about their child’s progress. Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, described the policy as “levelling up in action” but the pledge drew criticism for replicating what schools already do. “The parent pledge seems like a policy gimmick designed to grab headlines,” said Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders. “In reality, any child who falls behind in English and maths will already receive timely and evidence-led support and this is already communicated to parents via existing channels such as parents’ evenings.” Barton said the danger of the pledge was that it “will build an expectation of an entitlement” and create tension between parents and teachers. Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, said: “Parents will be surprised to hear that a focus on helping every child develop good reading, writing and maths skills is a new discovery for the education secretary.” Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrats’ education spokesperson, said: “It’s been six years since the last schools white paper yet clearly these half-baked plans needed even longer in the oven.” She argued that more funding was needed for catch-up provision, rather than meeting “hollow” targets.",News/Education,Councils allowed to set up academy trusts in shake-up of schools system,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/28/councils-allowed-to-set-up-academy-trusts-in-shake-up-of-schools-system
3/28/2022,"Less than half of the severely immunosuppressed adults in England have had their Covid booster, and levels of uptake differ dramatically across ethnicities, data shows. Everyone over the age of 12 in the UK can have two doses of a Covid jab, and those aged 16 and over and some children aged 12 to 15 can have a third jab, known as a booster. A second booster programme began this month in England, Scotland and Wales for people aged 75 and over, older people living in care homes, and anyone aged 12 and over who has a weakened immune system. Northern Ireland’s campaign is to get under way shortly. But the situation is more complex for those who are severely immunosuppressed. From September these individuals were offered a third jab as part of their primary vaccination programme, with a subsequent booster shot announced in late November. Severely immunosuppressed people will be offered a fifth dose – their second booster – as part of the spring programme. Now a leading charity has raised concerns after figures released on Friday by NHS England revealed that by 24 March only 255,422 out of the 561,356 individuals identified as severely immunosuppressed in England had received their fourth dose – which is their first booster – leaving 305,934 (54%) without maximum protection. While Blood Cancer UK said the situation had improved since 6 February – at which point data released through a freedom of information request suggested that only 16% of severely immunosuppressed people had received a fourth dose – the situation remained of concern. Gemma Peters, the chief executive of Blood Cancer UK, said she was “very worried” by the numbers. The charity noted that data from early February also suggested uptake of a fourth dose varied by ethnicity. While 17% of severely immunosuppressed people from a white British background had had that jab by this point, the figure was just 2% for those of a Bangladeshi background, and 3% for people of a black African background. The data suggested the overall uptake of fourth doses was slightly higher in Scotland: by 25 March almost 55% of people who are severely immunosuppressed had received a fourth jab – a total of 36,585 people. Blood Cancer UK said confusion and delays around third doses had had a knock-on effect on the date at which some people became eligible for their fourth jabs, adding that other possible reasons for some not yet receiving their booster could include people not being aware they are eligible, or not being contacted by the NHS. An NHS spokesperson said: “We welcome Blood Cancer UK’s clarification, with the latest data showing that around nine in 10 severely immunosuppressed people have had a third dose and nearly half have had a booster, which means that hundreds of thousands have had a top-up, with more coming forward every day. “Decisions on when to get the vaccine for those with a weakened immune system should be made between patient and a clinician and we continue to ask charities to use their profile to work alongside the NHS ensuring those due for their vaccine come forward.” Infection levels continue to rise in England, Scotland and Wales, with the data suggesting roughly one in 16 people in England had Covid in the most recent week, and one in 11 in Scotland, a record high. Figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal levels in England are highest in those aged two to school year six, with an estimated 8.3% of this group testing positive in the week ending 19 March. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, told the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme that about 200,000 children were off school in England because of coronavirus, and more details on the provision of free rapid tests would be released this week. The government has previously said that from 1 April free lateral flow and PCR tests will cease for the majority of people in England, with other countries in the UK also set to reduce free testing in the coming weeks and months. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “Removing free access to lateral flow tests at this point feels irresponsible. It will make tracking and controlling Covid almost impossible. There is a lot of anxiety from school leaders about what could happen once tests are unavailable.”",News/World news,Concern over low take-up of booster jabs by immunocompromised adults,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/28/concern-over-low-take-up-of-booster-jabs-by-immunocompromised-adults
3/28/2022,"Childhoods have got worse in the UK, with the majority of adults believing children’s futures have been blighted by the Covid pandemic, declining levels of mental health and financial hardship, a survey has found. More than half of parents and nearly two-thirds of grandparents believe life is more difficult and stressful now than when they were children, citing money issues, house prices, the climate crisis and emotional anxiety linked to school and social media, according to the charity Action for Children. Although children overall are more likely to have a positive outlook, a third believe their parents enjoyed a better childhood than theirs. Many cite increasing worries around mental health, school stress and family finances, with those from poorer backgrounds much more likely to be pessimistic. While 38% of children from low-income households (up to £20,000 a year) were more likely to say their childhoods were worse, this fell to 26% of children from households with an income of £70,000 or more. Similarly, 64% of poorer parents thought children’s lives were worse, compared with 48% from richer households. Nearly half of children from low-income households are worried about family finances, for example, compared with 14% of children from wealthier families. Children from poorer families are far less confident they will get the job they want, and twice as likely to believe they will not get to university. “We are all going through the experience of the pandemic and the cost of living crisis, but the difficulty is felt so much more intensively if you are on a low income,” said Imran Hussain, the director of policy and campaigns at Action for Children. Although all children were worried about climate crisis, those from wealthier backgrounds were more likely to be concerned. More than half of children from wealthier families (56%) highlighted this, compared with 29% from low-income backgrounds. Mental illness continued to register as a major worry for children, with 42% believing their own mental health to be an issue, compared with 29% when the question was asked in the previous Action for Children childhood survey in 2019. Recognition by adults of childhood mental health as an issue has also accelerated, the survey found. In 2019, 17% of parents and 9% of grandparents recognised mental health as a concern. By 2021 this had increased to 45% of parents and 30% of grandparents. Hussain said: “Despite the worst cost of living crisis since records began, the limited help for struggling families in last week’s spring statement was hugely disappointing. Our research shows how much children are concerned about ‘adult issues’, with those in the poorest households worrying the most about their family’s finances.” He added: “It is the fundamental responsibility of any government to make sure every generation of children has a better childhood and a brighter future than the last, but day in, day out our frontline staff support families faced with making decisions about whether to put the heat on or put food on the table.” The survey of 5,000 young people, parents and grandparents was carried out between December and January. The Department for Education has been approached for comment.",News/Society,"Childhoods have got worse in Britain, survey reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/28/childhoods-have-got-worse-in-britain-survey-reveals
3/28/2022,"The first inquiry of its kind held in England is investigating the deaths of 1,500 people who died while being cared for as patients of NHS mental health services in Essex. They died in circumstances that were “unexpected, unexplained or self-inflicted” between 2000 and 2020 and while they were receiving treatment from NHS mental health trusts that for years had faced persistent complaints of providing poor care. The 1,500 cases include children and young people as well as adults. All 1,500 were highly vulnerable after experiencing a serious deterioration in their mental health and died either while they were an inpatient in a mental health facility or within three months of being discharged. Dr Geraldine Strathdee, who is leading the inquiry, said some of the evidence she and her team had collected so far was distressing and included “unacceptable examples of dispassionate behaviours that families believe contributed to the death of their loved ones”. Unveiling initial findings from her inquiries so far, Strathdee said families had suffered “unimaginable pain and heartache” and major changes were needed. She has so far identified three recurring failings at the now-defunct North Essex and South Essex mental health trusts and at Essex Partnership University NHS trust. This was formed in 2017 by a merger of the previous trusts and supplied the details of the 1,500 cases now being looked into. They are: Serious concerns about patients’ physical, mental and sexual safety while on a ward, including claims of sexual harassment and sexual assault. Big differences in the quality of care patients received, “both in staff attitudes and in the use of effective treatments”. Patients and their families being given too little information about their treatment, likely length of stay and chances of recovery. Strathdee, a leading psychiatrist and former national clinical director of mental health care at NHS England, is looking into 21 key areas of care. They include trusts’ management of patients’ risk of self-harm and suicide, use of restraint, deployment of drugs and management of drug regimes, and how well they dealt with patients’ physical health needs. The inquiry was established in January 2021 by Nadine Dorries, the then minister for mental health, as a non-statutory independent inquiry. She acted amid ongoing concern about the quality and safety of mental health in Essex and after an investigation in 2019 by Rob Behrens, the parliamentary and health service ombudsman, which found numerous failings in the events surrounding the deaths of 20-year-old Matthew Leahy and another young man named only as Mr R. Inquest, which investigates deaths in custody and residential mental health care, said the deaths amounted to “a national scandal”. Selen Cavcav, a senior caseworker at the charity, said: “Sadly we are not shocked by the findings because we have long known how unsafe these services are, and the huge number of people who have been impacted by that. “The scale of this problem and the details of many deaths of people under the care of Essex mental health services are nothing short of a national scandal.” Some families with a relative who died while or after receiving mental health care in Essex have refused to participate in Strathdee’s inquiry because it is not a full public inquiry. Cavcav said: “We continue to believe that only an inquiry with more teeth, namely a statutory public inquiry, will restore trust and ensure the broad-ranging scrutiny needed to tackle the unacceptable death toll of people under the care of Essex mental health services.” But, she added: “Essex is not alone in having high numbers of preventable deaths of mental health patients, in a country whose mental health system has long been failing countless people in need.” In a brief statement, Paul Scott, the chief executive of the merged Essex trust, did not apologise for failings or lives lost. He said only that “we continue to support the ongoing inquiry and encourage service users, family, carers and staff to share their experiences with the inquiry team so they have a full picture to draw on to make their recommendations.” Strathdee is appealing for former patients and for relatives of those who died to talk to the inquiry, which has set up a Twitter account to encourage people to share their experiences.

3/28/2022,"Oh? Canada? Yes, Canada. Almost four decades after their only appearance at a men’s World Cup, Canada are back, becoming the first North American nation to secure passage to Qatar 2022. In the most fitting style and circumstances John Herdman’s side, who have surprised first their own country and then Concacaf, qualified with an emphatic 4-0 win over Jamaica at a raucous BMO Field in Toronto. The team sent thousands in the stadium – and millions more across the country – into delight. The circumstances were fitting because the weather gods of the great white north scoffed at the idea of spring and sent freezing snow showers and wild winds whipping in off Lake Ontario for this historic Sunday. But the style too was apt because Herdman, the Englishman who has almost single-handedly transformed the country into a men’s football nation, saw his side conquer the climate and seal progress with 90 minutes of swashbuckling counter-attacking. Just four of a feast of chances were taken but no matter. After so long in exile, all that mattered was the return. And now, suddenly, bright and bold in brilliant red, here are Canada. How? Because, simply put, these last 12 months were unlike any that came before for Canadian football. First of all, the women’s team won gold at the Tokyo Olympics. And all the while, the men were steering a course to their first World Cup since 1986. Sunday marked Canada’s 24th game in exactly 12 months, a barely precedented schedule that should have been soul-sapping. It could have strained untested bodies and minds. Instead it bound the team together, forging a collective will that shone through one starry (and snowy) night after the next. A journey that began with wins over the likes of the Cayman Islands behind closed doors has, in one year, accumulated memories to last lifetimes. Victory in Haiti as they advanced to the final qualifying round of Concacaf for the first time since 1998; Alphonso Davies’ solo wonder goal against Panama; vanquishing Mexico at the Iceteca; Milan Borjan bellowing as the US were beaten in Hamilton. Now this Canadian heritage moment: sealing a World Cup berth in squalls and sunshine. In September, Herdman spoke to the Guardian about feeling “a freedom” to make history and how “brotherhood” would be what would get them there. The same word kept coming up. There’s little doubt that the schedule helped Canada’s family flourish. On the eve of this decisive date with Jamaica, midfielder Stephen Eustaquio said he’ll “invite all of [the team] to my wedding. They’re family.” Cyle Larin may have claimed the best man’s role after 13 minutes on Sunday as Herdman’s side countered with purpose and Eustaquio threaded a pass the striker’s way. He dispatched it past Andre Blake and Canadian lungs emptied in delight. Tajon Buchanan added the second a minute before the break, sweeping the ball home – and sweeping a nation off its feet. BMO Field’s West Stand swayed as Canadians jumped in delight. After having so many chances to get to know the team this past year, they fans are now smitten. The hectic schedule was of course also something to be tamed. Herdman has done so spectacularly. Of the 23 games before Sunday, Canada had won 16 and drawn four, losing just three times, each by a single goal. That Davies, the team’s best player, missed seven of the 14 qualifiers and spent Sunday screaming his support on social media from Munich, tells you how Herdman coaxed so much from so many. Canada 2021-22 are not Leicester City 2015-16. The international and club games are now distant cousins and the latter’s Premier League title was a far larger shock than Herdman’s team reaching the World Cup. But some similarities are striking. A counter-attacking style confounding vaunted opponents. An unheralded defence, thought a weakness, turning into a strength as veterans and new faces raised their game. A core, yes, but around them, a fluid cast who leaned into a ‘next man up’ mantra. Now they are all up, to a height not seen for more than a generation. It means a new era for football in Canada. And for Concacaf? The continental plates have shifted in a way that is unlikely to be temporary. Canada will co-host the 2026 World Cup, and the team’s best players (Davies, David, Buchanan) are still young. Herdman has scouted eligible recruits too. Now he has the carrot of back-to-back World Cups to dangle. North American football feels changed utterly. As if to remind everyone just how far they had come, Herdman sent captain Atiba Hutchison on with a half hour to go on Sunday. The 39-year-old midfielder, in his 20th season with the national team, was showered with affection from the stands as the sun came back out. The industrious Junior Hoilett added a third and Adrian Mariappa turned one into his own net in the last 10 minutes but as the flurries of snow returned and the Canadian bench streamed on to the field at full-time, the scoreline seemed almost irrelevant. Where are Canada? They’re right here.",Sport/Football,Oh Canada!
