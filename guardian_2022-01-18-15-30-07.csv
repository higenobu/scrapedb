1/18/2022,"Scanning the shelves and internet for fish oil is a dizzying task. There are dozens of brands available and, although the typical consideration for the popular supplement is that quality matters most, it is not the only factor. These prized products travel a long way before being labelled as “pure” and “fresh” – starting with the industrial-scale grinding down of a tiny fish that is crucial for healthy ocean and food systems.  While some fish oil is made from cod, mackerel or sardines, most comes from Peruvian anchovetas, a type of anchovy. These silvery fish are an important source of nutrition for the wildlife in the Humboldt Current, one of the most productive marine ecosystems on Earth. “I think people should know where the fish in their fish oil is coming from. It’s always good to have a face to the product they’re consuming,” says Katrina Nakamura, founder of the Sustainability Incubator, which screens labour conditions inside food supply chains. As the world’s largest fishery, the anchoveta catch in Peru is enormous – exceeding 4m tonnes a year. Some of the haul is frozen and canned for human consumption, but it is mainly used to feed pigs, poultry and farmed fish. Aquaculture is an expanding global industry, valued at more than £146bn in 2020, with China topping the list as the largest fish-producing country, at 58.8m tonnes a year. Aquaculture now provides half of all the seafood that humans eat – a figure expected to grow to 62% by 2030. Now, large industry players in Peru want to scale up fish oil operations for dietary supplements, too. Though there is still debate among scientists about the benefits of the golden-coloured supplements, there is some evidence that omega-3 fatty acids, including EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), can aid in heart and brain function, lower the risk of cognitive function disorders, and may help to reduce inflammation. Anchovetas are rich in EPA and DHA. According to the Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3 (GOED), the industry body of omega-3 producers, an estimated 38,000 tonnes of anchovy oil are extracted for dietary supplements each year. “It’s mind-boggling. What we can catch in a week is what many countries catch in more than one year,” says Patricia Majluf, vice-president of Oceana Peru, part of the international conservation organisation that campaigns to protect and restore the world’s oceans. “And the processing capacity of the factories is even bigger.” Despite being highly regulated, the fishery has recently been condemned for misreporting catches, and for putting workers’ health at risk throughout the Covid-19 pandemic by failing to isolate infected crew members, leading to large outbreaks, according to a report by the Changing Markets Foundation, which in 2020 investigated harmful and unsustainable practices in Peru’s fishmeal and fish oil industry. The fishery is also reportedly catching too many juvenile anchovetas – if the fish are caught before they reproduce, the population cannot sustain itself. Oceana has reported that some factories in southern Peru are operating illegally without appropriate permits or licences, and producing fishmeal in unsanitary conditions, while also skewing catch quotas. Although Peru’s anchovetas are at risk of being overfished, and the fishery was on the verge of collapse in the early 1970s, the companies responsible face few sanctions. Regulations do impose temporary closures in areas where juvenile catches exceed 10%, but seven large companies in the sector flouted this rule between 2016 and 2019 and continued operating in areas already identified as having excess juvenile fish. In one case, 80 fishermen were threatened with dismissal for refusing to catch juvenile fish. “We’re extracting millions of tonnes from an ecosystem that depends on that fish. The ecosystem is being impoverished and losing its resilience to big changes brought about by El Niños and climate change,” says Majluf. “That fish could be used to feed our people. An industry that’s paying almost nothing for that fish is taking it all away.” Major fish oil brands including Nature’s Bounty, Nature Made, Sundown and Kirkland tout their products as sustainably sourced from Peru; some list anchovies as an ingredient. For example, Nature’s Bounty claims: “We go to Peru because the Peruvian government has strict standards and governance on their surrounding waterways, to properly ensure the protection of the fish … all catches in Peru are carefully reviewed to meet rigorous quality checks.” But what ends up on the shelves can still be a rotten batch: independent tests show that an alarming amount of fish oil supplements, at least 10%, are rancid. Some products reached 11 times higher than international voluntary limits for rancidity. “It’s quite a long path that fish oils take to get to you,” says Dr Ben Albert, a fellow at the University of Auckland and a researcher into the oils’ health effects. “[Rancidity] is unlikely to be from the fish that’s caught.” Oxidation is a normal and usually harmless process, but rancidity arises when a product is highly oxidised. In fish oil, it happens when the oil is exposed to light, air or heat – all of which tend to occur within the long and complex supply chain involved in refining the crude product. Trade data is limited, but what is available shows that vessels can pick up a cargo of crude fish oil in Peru and ship it to China for extraction and distillation. From there, the oil moves to North America or Europe to be packaged. It’s difficult to protect the product as it moves through the production process. Time spent in the open air or in hot conditions increases the likelihood of oxidation. “That’s part of the problem: we don’t know who these companies are exporting to. There are so many chains along the way,” says Alfonso Daniels, a researcher on the Changing Markets report. In general, fish oil supplements are difficult to trust, says Albert. Though it should not just be left up to the consumer, his recommendation is to buy smaller amounts and store fish oils in darker, cooler places to avoid further oxidation. None of the companies or the Peruvian authorities responded to the Guardian’s request for comment. Alternatives such as krill or algae oil also contain unsaturated fats that allow oxidation to occur. Although both products are usually sold as a more “ecologically viable” option to overfishing critical fish populations, concerns remain: krill is often caught using harmful fishing practices, and further research is needed to develop efficient production from algae. Meanwhile, fish oil continues to be the supplement of choice. “I think fish oil is a good product. I’m not mad at the fish oil industry for existing. But they have to respect the people in the supply chain, and they have to respect the fish and the ecosystem the fish come from,” says Nakamura.",News/Environment,‘It’s mind-boggling’: the hidden cost of our obsession with fish oil pills,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/18/mind-boggling-hidden-cost-ecosystems-obsession-with-fish-oil-pills

1/18/2022,"Soaring energy bills could eat up more than half of some UK households’ incomes, a leading poverty charity has said, amid warnings that vulnerable people will be left unable to eat regularly or could even be at risk of death from the cold. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) said that while households across the board faced bill increases of 40% to 47% from April, there would be huge variations in the ability of families to cope.  Energy bills would amount to 6% of the average income of a middle-income family but 18% for a low-income family. This would rise to 25% for lone parents and couples without children, while single-adult households on low incomes could be forced to spend 54% of their income on gas and electricity when the new energy price cap comes in on 1 April, the JRF found. “Rising energy prices will affect us all but our analysis shows they have the potential to devastate the budgets of families on the lowest incomes. The government cannot stand by and allow the rising cost of living to knock people off their feet,” said Katie Schmuecker, the deputy director of policy and partnerships at the JRF. The warning came as one of the UK’s most respected financial advisers, Martin Lewis, said ministers must intervene urgently to help vulnerable people whose lives could be at risk. Lewis, the founder of the consumer advice website MoneySavingExpert, said the government must provide billions of pounds in support to millions of poorer households who faced major financial stress and “heat or eat” decisions. “We absolutely know we need a substantial increase in the billions of pounds funding to vulnerable people, and people on low incomes, or it is not an exaggeration to say some will have to choose between heating or eating, and that is not appropriate in one of the world’s richest economies and a civilised nation,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “What we can’t get away from is we are going to need to put money into the system or we are going to have an absolute, not a relative, an absolute poverty crisis in this country, with people really being unable to eat or dying because of the cold.” JRF said the impact of energy costs would be especially harsh on families that have been trapped in “deep poverty” in recent years. About one in five children were in families classed as being on low incomes for three of the four years between 2016 and 2019, meaning for many, poverty was “all they have ever known”. “Broadly speaking, there seems little prospect of reversing the trends since around 2012/13 of rising child poverty (which rose by four percentage points to almost a third of children by 2019/20) and rising pensioner poverty (which has risen by five percentage points to almost a fifth of pensioners by 2019/20),” the JRF report said. A government spokesperson said: “We recognise the pressures people are facing on their household bills, which is why we have taken decisive steps to support them. The energy price cap has been protecting around 15m households from high global gas prices. We are also supporting vulnerable and low-income households with the cost of fuel bills through schemes such as the warm home discount and our £500m household support fund. “Working families on universal credit are already seeing more money in their pockets, with an average of £1,000 more a year, and we’re increasing the living wage again in April. We will continue to look closely at the pressures facing people and what further measures might be needed on abating high energy costs.”",Lifestyle/Money,"Poor UK households may have to spend half their income on energy, says charity",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/18/poor-uk-households-may-have-to-spend-half-their-income-on-energy-says-charity
1/18/2022,"A senior academic who says she was sacked from her post in a university’s physics department because of her loud voice has been awarded more than £100,000 after winning a claim for unfair dismissal. Dr Annette Plaut told the Guardian she had a “naturally loud voice” that came from her middle European Jewish background and claimed it was the combination of her being “female and loud” that had led to her dismissal from the University of Exeter.  Plaut, who had worked at the physics department for 29 years, accused the university of being “institutionally unconsciously biased” and said she was taking medication for stress brought on by her former employer’s treatment of her. During a tribunal last year, Plaut was described as a “Marmite” character, valued by many but considered “overbearing” by others who disliked her “boisterous” style. The university argued during the tribunal that she had been dismissed over the way she dealt with two PhD students and insists it had nothing to do with her background or her sex. Speaking on Monday after the university was ordered to pay her just under £101,000, Plaut said: “I have a naturally loud voice. As such I have no ability to sense when I am speaking loudly. “The loud voice comes from my family background and is a perfectly normal and acceptable way to speak amongst people of middle and eastern European Jewish background. In New York or Germany where I have lived and worked for years at a time, the loudness of my voice was never mentioned even once. “Only in Exeter have I been put under pressure to change this inherent characteristic that is fundamentally integral to me and who I am. I believe that it is the combination of being female and loud that some senior members of the university and HR [human resources] persist in condemning, as this combination contradicts their stereotypical assumptions of how a woman should behave. “I have been consistently treated unfairly by the university over decades to the extent that I was targeted for dismissal, and that that targeting was tainted by sex, in a male-orientated department, and race as it was unconscious bias against my inherent characteristics, which were an integral part of my race.” Both Plaut’s parents were born into Jewish families in Germany and fled to the UK as children. Her maternal grandfather was interned in a concentration camp while her paternal grandfather went into hiding. Plaut, 59, joined the university in 1990 as the first female academic in the physics department. She said: “I enjoyed my job – I liked teaching and was especially keen on experimental physics research in a laboratory that I had built up over the years from scratch.” She was twice suspended before she was dismissed and was told she could not speak to fellow workers or students while she was being investigated, leaving her feel humiliated and isolated. Plaut said she still felt anxiety, particularly as the university has said it will appeal against the tribunal’s decision. “I have never previously ever suffered from any mental health condition. I still continue to take daily medication to reduce my ongoing stress.” She said she would have liked to get her job back but the tribunal’s remedy judgment concluded that this was not practical as there was “entrenched bias against Dr Plaut in the human resources department and in the senior echelons of the university”. The judgment added: “Her life was centred on the university where she had worked for 30 years. Her social circle was almost totally linked to the university. Academics customarily retain access to university email accounts and facilities even when retired. All this is removed from her by her unfair dismissal.” The remedy judgment said it was “difficult to imagine the depth of humiliation, hurt, stress and worry” for Plaut after she was suspended, adding: “Every aspect of her life and future was at risk, and for no good reason, and unfairly.” Plaut said she had spoken out not out of any vindictiveness towards the university but as an attempt to prevent anyone else in future being similarly mistreated. A University of Exeter spokesperson said: “We continue to believe there are serious inaccuracies in these judgments and we are appealing the decision to the employment appeals tribunal.” ",News/Education,"‘Loud’ academic awarded more than £100,000 for unfair dismissal",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/18/loud-academic-awarded-more-than-100000-for-unfair-dismissal
1/18/2022,"Four inmates at an Arkansas jail have filed a lawsuit against the facility and its doctor after they said they were unknowingly prescribed ivermectin to treat Covid-19 as a form of “medical experimentation” despite US health officials warning that the anti-parasitic drug should not be used for that purpose. The Arkansas’ chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit on behalf of the men last week against Washington county jail, Washington county sheriff Tim Helder and jail physician Dr. Robert Karas. Last August, Helder revealed that the drug had been prescribed to patients with Covid-19.  “The lawsuit charges the defendants for administering ivermectin to incarcerated individuals without prior informed consent as to the nature, contents, or potential side effects of the drug,” the ACLU said in a statement last week. Gary Sullivan, legal director of the ACLU of Arkansas, condemned Helder’s actions, saying: “No one – including incarcerated individuals – should be deceived and subject to medical experimentation. Sheriff Helder has a responsibility to provide food, shelter, and safe, appropriate care to incarcerated individuals.” “Plaintiffs ingested incredibly high doses of a drug that credible medical professionals, the FDA, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), all agree is not an effective treatment against Covid-19, and that if given in large doses is dangerous for humans,” the lawsuit said. The lawsuit went on to allege that Karas told the inmates that the prescribed drugs “consisted of mere ‘vitamins,’ ‘antibiotics,’ and/or ‘steroids’”. It added, “Had plaintiffs been informed that the drugs they were given included the dewormer ivermectin and informed of its nature and potential side effects, they would have refused to take it.” According to the lawsuit, the inmates suffered from side effects that included vision issues, diarrhea, bloody stools and stomach cramps. The inmates were also subject to payment of fees for medical examinations that they sought after experiencing the side effects from the drug. Karas has said he began administering ivermectin at the jail in November 2020. The four inmates were prescribed ivermectin after testing positive for Covid-19 in August, the lawsuit said, In a letter sent by his attorney last September, Karas told a state medical board examiner that 254 inmates at the jail had been treated with the drug. The medical board has been investigating complaints against Karas over the jail’s use of ivermectin and is expected to discuss the investigation’s findings at its February meeting. Ivermectin has been touted worldwide. But last July, a major study that supported the medication as a Covid treatment was withdrawn over ethical concerns. As reports of ivermectin use continue, the federal Food and Drug Administration warned against using animal-strength forms of the drug as a treatment for Covid-19. “Taking large doses of this drug is dangerous and can cause serious harm,” it said, adding that the drug can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, delirium and death.",News/US news,Inmates sue jail over ivermectin treatment for Covid as ‘medical experimentation’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/17/arkansas-inmates-lawsuit-covid-ivermectin
1/18/2022,"Iwas sent to Brussels early in my ill-fated career as a City solicitor, to an office in a stunning Belle Époque building with a murky colonial past and beautiful stained-glass windows. It was thrillingly foreign, with office lunches that put Boots’ meal deals to shame and sparkling wine at the weekly “tea time”. I was delighted, but convinced it was a clerical error. Foreign postings were supposed to reward the best; I devoted most of my time and energy to evading work. I was also irrationally terrified of the fabled “all-nighter”, a corporate law rite of passage. I think I believed that, gremlin-like, something terrible would happen if I was exposed to spreadsheets after midnight – I would reveal I didn’t actually understand them, perhaps. I had developed hacks to ensure this never happened: dodging notorious taskmasters, fibbing about my workload, and leaving my computer on when I went home.  This kind of subterfuge was impossible in Brussels. The antique tiles echoed when I tried to sneak out and I was sharing an office with my new boss, J, an ultra-ambitious workaholic. Shortly after arrival, I was caught muttering: “Fucking hell, Sharon,” on a call to a lawyer who made me stay late: I had to pretend I was swearing at the printer. I needed to step up and prove my after-hours mettle. The opportunity arose rapidly. J said yes to yet another job – an urgent regulatory filing for a chemical manufacturer – and scheduled an all-day client meeting to finalise it with me, another junior lawyer and our brilliant paralegal. Usually, our clients were sleek and terrifying, like sharks, but these two, straight from a chemical plant in rural Germany, had a different vibe. They were as jolly as a two-man oompah band, and in no apparent hurry, firing off dubious jokes and asking for beers as we settled in to crunch the numbers. We knew it would be a long meeting, but it was surreally, incomprehensibly long. We made no progress over the duration of several meals, many hours and many more spreadsheets, as every sentence or figure was chewed over by the double act. About 7pm, J had to leave to fly to another meeting, leaving the rest of us to wrap things up. Without any “grownups” around, we were powerless to stop the chemical brothers from diving off on numerous tangents, changing their minds continuously and trying to type on our laptops with their arms around our shoulders. The hours spun out, shapeless and full of percentages I didn’t understand. Midnight came and went. At one point, the paralegal, undoubtedly the calmest and most competent woman I knew, walked out, quietly. Curious, I followed her. She was standing shaking with hysterical laughter in the corridor. I think that was the moment I finally relaxed and started to enjoy the absolute anarchy of it all. I had not gone gremlin: I was bewildered and resentful and had definitely messed up some exchange rate calculations, yes, but that was my normal state. Actually, it was getting so silly, it was almost … fun? The meeting eventually fizzled out. We went home, exhausted and semi-hysterical, in the small hours; the chemical brothers ended up in a hotel that, they claimed gleefully, turned out to be a brothel. Months later, their boss complained about the bill and our “needless physical presence” at the meeting. J stood up for us all, even me and my dodgy exchange rates.

1/18/2022,"The Azores – the name supposedly has its origins in the word “hawk” or “blue” – is an archipelago of 10 main islands, situated in the eastern Atlantic, roughly 1,300km (800 miles) west of this autonomous region’s mother country, Portugal. Entirely surrounded by sea, and with the ameliorating influence of the Gulf Stream, the islands have a very mild, at times subtropical, climate. There are few extremes of temperature and moderate rainfall, especially in the autumn and winter months, totalling about 1,200mm (48in) annually.  During the summer and early autumn, maximum temperatures are usually in the low-to-mid 20Cs, with seven or eight hours of sunshine a day, making the islands the ideal holiday destination for those who prefer conditions to be pleasant, but not too hot. In winter and spring these drop to the high teens – still mild, though from time to time Atlantic depressions can bring high winds and storms. When these strong westerlies occur in autumn, they sometimes bring rare land and waterbirds from North America, which have been swept off course on their southward migration, until they are able to make a safe landfall on the islands. Snow and frost are unknown at sea level, though occasionally occur in the mountainous interior of the larger islands, with snow settling on the mountain of Pico, which, at 2,351 metres (7,713ft) above sea level, is the highest point in Portugal.",News/News,"Weatherwatch: the sun-filled, mild climate of the Azores",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jan/18/weatherwatch-the-sun-filled-mild-climate-of-the-azores
1/18/2022,"Rebel Tories are upping pressure on Boris Johnson to quit over the Downing Street parties scandal, with one naming the plan “Operation Rinka” in reference to the dog killed in the Jeremy Thorpe affair in the 1970s. While Downing Street insiders have reportedly devised a plan to sack officials and save Johnson, referred to as “Operation Save Big Dog”, some Tory MPs are stepping up pressure on colleagues to submit letters of no confidence in the prime minister.  One backbencher nicknamed the campaign to oust Johnson Operation Rinka after the great dane shot dead on Exmoor in 1975 – an incident that eventually led to the Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe standing trial for conspiracy to murder. Another backbencher recalled a phrase favoured by the former US president Ronald Reagan – “dance with the one that brung ya”. Suggesting Johnson had failed to deliver on the policies he pledged at the last election, the MP said: “He’s not dancing with the people that brung him into Downing Street.” Among the groups being lobbied to submit no confidence letters was the 2019 new intake of Tory MPs, many of whom felt they owed their electoral success to Johnson. However, some are similarly frustrated that attention on the parties during lockdown has distracted from delivery on key policies. Two MPs elected in 2019 said they knew of about a dozen colleagues in the same intake who had put letters in. Johnson faced further fury from MPs as they arrived back at Westminster on Monday, having been pilloried by Conservative associations and constituents. Some reported receiving nearly 1,000 emails from angry voters, though others suggested they were pleasantly surprised at hearing few mentions of “partygate” during constituency surgeries or over the weekend. A senior government source said Johnson’s problem was different from the days of Theresa May’s turbulence when there was then just one group – Brexiters – whose anger had to be quelled. The source said multiple groups were angry with Johnson: lockdown sceptics, disgruntled ex-ministers and MPs from former Labour red wall seats who judged him to be failing to deliver on the levelling-up agenda. “It only takes a dozen letters from each group to get you close to the 54 you need [to trigger a no confidence vote in the prime minister], so it’s harder to keep them all down at once,” the source said. Steve Baker, a longtime thorn in the side of Conservative governments who helped bring down May, refused to say whether he had submitted a no confidence letter but said: “People are very upset and angry.” He said MPs were “mostly waiting for Sue Gray’s report” before deciding Johnson’s fate, referring to the investigation by the senior civil servant into the multiple alleged breaches of Covid rules inside Downing Street and Whitehall over the past 18 months. But asked whether Johnson would lead the Conservatives into the next election, Baker said: “In a situation as volatile as this, I think it’s impossible to say and I regret that very much. I would still prefer that Boris Johnson were a roaring success. But right now, listening to the public who remember very well all the sacrifices they made, I think people may well be too angry to forgive – but it remains to be seen.” Other MPs said their inbox was “off the scale” with complaints about Johnson, particularly from local Conservatives who hoped he would be replaced before local elections on 5 May.

1/18/2022,"Here’s a good pub quiz question: what do David Shrigley, Tracey Emin and, er, Prince Charles have in common? The answer is they’ve all painted works of art you can order in a restaurant. Because while a wine bottle may provide only the slenderest of canvases, that hasn’t stopped some of the biggest names in the world of art from daubing something onto the label’s few square inches. The latest to do so is Olafur Eliasson, the revered Icelandic–Danish environmental artist who created a work for the 2019 vintage of Château Mouton Rothschild – a series of ellipses that form a ring charting the path of the sun in relation to the chateau’s location in Pauillac, south-west France. If you really want to understand the bond between fine art and fine wine, there is no better chateau to start with. Since its first artistic collaboration in 1924, the roll-call of names to grace its bottles is astonishing: Salvador Dalí doodled the winery’s ram emblem for the 1958 vintage, Jeff Koons modified a first-century Roman fresco in 2010 and, four years later, David Hockney provided an empty and full glass.  Other names to have graced its grape vestibule include – and you really need to take a deep breath here – Georges Braque (1955), Henry Moore (1964), Dorothea Tanning (1965), Joan Miró (1969), Wassily Kandinsky (1971), Pablo Picasso (1973), Andy Warhol (1975), Keith Haring (1988), Francis Bacon (1990), Lucian Freud (2006), Anish Kapoor (2009) and Gerhard Richter (2015). Prince Charles too, his watercolour landscape gracing the 2004 vintage, which celebrated 100 years of the Entente Cordiale. Wine labels have existed for centuries – the jars buried with King Tutankhamun are said to have been etched with details about their vintage, region and even quality (the Vivino app was still in the pipeline at this point). But Mouton was the first to truly embrace the art, when a 22-year-old Baron Philippe de Rothschild decided to break with tradition and invite the designer of a Parisian theatre to create something new. That idea lay dormant while the Rothchilds were forced to flee France during the Nazi occupation. After restoring the vineyards damaged by German troops, Philippe revived the idea of artist-drawn labels, starting with a Churchill-inspired V for victory by the illustrator, novelist and dandy Philippe Jullian. A tradition was born and, should you visit the chateau, you can see all of the works in its Museum of Wine. These days, Julien de Beaumarchais de Rothschild is in charge of commissioning the artworks, alongside his brother and sister. The criteria are simple: the art-loving family simply have to like someone’s work, although they “also consider their eminent position in the art world, which must be comparable to that of Château Mouton Rothschild in the wine world. The artists agree disinterestedly, because they do not need Mouton Rothschild to enhance their reputation.” While the artists are given complete creative freedom, tracking them down isn’t always easy. For the 1982 vintage, Baron Philippe was determined to recruit the film director John Huston. His wife, Baroness Philippine, discovered he was filming Under the Volcano in an isolated part of Mexico accessible only by boat and, undeterred, she set off on her own. “She arrived,” says Julien, “in a place described as ‘unknown to men or gods’. But after three days there, she returned with a watercolour of a ram leaping in Dionysiac joy.” Julien’s decision to involve Eliasson began, unsurprisingly, over a bottle of wine after the two met at an exhibition in Versailles. Eliasson’s willingness arose from his love of food and drink, which also have professional uses. “The kitchen at my studio,” he says, “plays a very important role with my team, acting as a kind of social glue, bringing people together around a table to exchange ideas. The prospect of turning a wine bottle into an artwork seemed an extension of that.” His path-of-the sun-label reflected a desire to focus on the winemaking process. “I find it fascinating that every plant stores a bit of sunlight and soil in its leaves and fruit,” he says. “The environment is transformed into a liquid that you take into your body. This is worth reflecting on when you hold the bottle or take a sip.” Mixing alcohol with art can, of course, have its pitfalls. “I started work by having a glass,” says Eliasson, “but that produced nothing but silliness and fun. I decided not to have another – until I was done with the first sketch.” Mouton Rothschild may have been the pioneer but, since the turn of the century, artists and wine have become a pairing as reliable as oysters and Chablis. Tracey Emin sketched a solo drinker for Mark Hix’s Portuguese Tonnix range; Rebecca Horn created a 3D kinetic sculpture of copper wire and mirrors around a nine-litre salmanazar of Ornellaia’s 2008 Super Tuscan; Yoko Ono’s design for Chianti Classico by Nittardi paid tribute to both the Renaissance artist Michelangelo, who once owned the winery, and to John Lennon, with the words “Imagine You” underneath various vessels. Some estates, such as Leeuwin in Australia, follow Mouton Rothschild’s lead with their own artist series. Contributions have included John Olsen’s Frogs in Riesling and an intoxicating abstract by aboriginal artist Jimmy Nerrimah for a 2013 Shiraz. Ruinart also has an artist series. You might not think David Shrigley, with his strange childlike drawings and blunt wordings, was a great fit for the world’s oldest champagne house. But it let him loose on its range last year, allowing him to cartoonify the font and add some offbeat statements around the label that, he says, “they just about accepted”. His messages for the range included: “You can judge a bottle by the label”, “Worms work harder than us” and “Keep your filthy hands off our grapes”. For Shrigley, designing a wine label was an opportunity for self-improvement. “I thought, ‘I’m never going to get to go to Reims and meet a cellar-master and develop a deep understanding of how champagne is made otherwise.’ You end up learning an awful lot about stuff.” While not unaware of other, er, motivations (“We got to eat lots of nice food and drink lots of very good champagne”) Shrigley saw the project as a necessary step for himself as an artist. “If you’re just left to your own devices then, after a certain point, you have much less to make art about. Left to your own devices, you’re never going to go out and make art about grapes. It was an opportunity to change a little bit.” While it was a nice career interval for Shrigley, for others it’s an all-consuming part of their life. Dave Phinney is the winemaker at Orin Swift, producing deep Californian reds and elegant whites. He grew up around galleries but was also immersed in the LA skateboard/punk scene in the late 80s and early 90s. So when it came to releasing his first wine, an inventive zinfandel blend called The Prisoner, he wanted to make a statement by using a modified version of The Little Prisoner by Goya. The Spanish painter’s etching of a crouched figure in shackles is not, it’s fair to say, the most immediately commercial image that springs to mind. “Everyone told me it was a horrible idea,” says Phinney, laughing. “My father-in-law is in the wine business and he almost forbade me. ‘You can’t do that!’” But his take on this unsettling look at human brutality was a success. “That gave us the confidence – and artistic licence – to continue.” Since then, says Phinney, Orin Swift has treated label-making as seriously as wine-making. And he’s not joking. Phinney knows of three Orin Swift drinkers who have tattoos of the company’s labels, a fact that reflects the amount of work that goes into them. For its red blend Machete, a photography shoot that was supposed to be over in a matter of minutes ended up taking three days. Creating the artwork for the winery’s Abstract wine was an even bigger labour of love. Inspired by a collage he saw in an Italian fashion magazine, Phinney decided to make his own from all the pages of magazines and books he’d torn out over the years. “I thought, ‘How hard can it be? I’ve got the photos and an idea.’ But it was way more difficult than I thought – how the colours interact, how the images interact, was a real puzzle.” By the end of the first day, he’d only completed a tiny fraction of the collage, so he emailed all his staff telling them to work from home until he was done. By the time the collage reached its finished size, around 5ft by 12ft, he had to build a scaffold just to photograph it. Then there were the potential issues with intellectual property rights: his lawyer advised him to sign the finished collage and sell it to his wife for $1 so it was considered an artwork and therefore allowed more leeway with all the photographs it contained. That wasn’t the end of the story: Phinney has since pieced it all back together, fixing things that bothered him, then placed it between two huge pieces of transparent lucite. And now he’s looking for a metal-worker to frame it, so the work can be displayed. “It will need a base of about half a ton to offset the weight,” he says. Having the artwork in this form has unexpected benefits: when Phinney saw the reverse side, he used that as a label for one of Orin Swift’s members-only wines called Inside Out. If this sounds obsessive, that’s because it is: obsession is what makes good wine and good art. But it’s not just about obsession. Both endeavours require patience, an understanding of the world and its rhythms, an ability to express something in a new a way. After speaking to Phinney, I wondered if he was just as much an artist as a wine-maker. Then I realised that maybe they’re the same thing.",Arts/Art and design,‘Waiter!

1/18/2022,"Term one is due to start in two weeks – except in Queensland and South Australia where it’s been delayed – but Australia is yet to release a national plan on how the return to school will be managed. This is what we know so far.  Hopefully on Thursday. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced a national framework for managing Covid in schools after the national cabinet meeting last week, which set out that education and early childcare centres were essential and should be the first services to open and the last to close in any outbreak situation. Morrison also announced that education and early childcare workers were among those essential workers no longer required to isolate for six days if they were a close contact and could instead return to work after a negative test. The actual plan – or “practical implementation of the framework” – is being developed by state and territory governments and should be finalised at the national cabinet meeting on 20 January. Guardian Australia contacted all state and territory education departments and was told their Covid response frameworks would be released once the national plan was finalised. Students in Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory (for new students only) will return to school on 31 January. Remote schools in the NT and returning students in the ACT will start on 1 February. Queensland and South Australia have both delayed the start of term one in an attempt to avoid the forecast peak of Omicron cases in those states. Students in South Australia in preschool, reception, year 1, year 7, year 8 and year 12 will return to face-to-face learning from 2 February. Students in years 2-6 and 9-11 will begin remote learning from 2 February. The aim is to have all students back on campus on 14 February. In Queensland, year 11 and 12 students will do one week of remote learning from 31 January, then all students will return to campus on 7 February. This is being finalised but the message from most states is yes – with the exact numbers and use of those tests yet to be determined. NSW will reportedly ask students to take two rapid antigen tests a week under a plan being developed in concert with the Victorian government. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, would not confirm the plan at a press conference on Tuesday but said: “At this stage we see rapid antigen tests playing a role as we open up schools.” South Australia said its education department was working with SA Health on the use of rapid antigen testing for students and staff – and confirmed the tests would be available in schools this year. The Australian Education Union’s Victorian branch president, Meredith Peace, said free and readily available RATs and access to priority PCR testing in the case of outbreaks were a vital part of any return-to-school strategy. “I don’t think we have a clear path to return to school without free and ready access to RAT tests across the country for both staff and students,” she said. “We won’t have an effective national plan unless we have effective testing protocols in place.” Students who have tested positive can’t return to school until they have recovered. Students who are the household contact of someone with Covid must follow the standard protocol – meaning they isolate for seven days and can return to school provided they test negative on day six. Teachers and education staff who test positive for Covid are required to stay home until they have recovered. Probably not, but this is for state and territory governments to decide. Classrooms are not listed on the national guidelines for close contacts, meaning the determination lies with the states. NSW and Victoria have suggested they will not require other students to stay home if a classmate tests positive. National cabinet last week added education and childcare workers to the list of essential workers who are no longer required to isolate if they are a close contact – if they have tested negative. State and territory governments have indicated they will follow this edict but we will know more about what schools are doing once they release the national plan. The AEU said it was “very concerned” that asking teachers not to isolate could lead to more infections. “We understand this is a difficult time but we don’t believe the health and safety of teachers should be put at risk in that way,” Peace said. “We are not supportive of the idea and we think it results in greater risk to not just teachers, but to students and families.” NSW has said it may call upon retired teachers and those in their final year of university to cover furloughed teaching staff. Other states say they will rely on an existing workforce of casual and relief teachers. Western Australia’s education minister, Sue Ellery, said her department had “more than 5,000 vaccinated casual staff in the system who can fill in where there are vacancies due to illness or otherwise”. The AEU said it would be up to individual schools to manage, but allowing some classes or year levels to switch to remote learning in response to an isolation requirement or a positive case could ease the pressure on teachers. But it said teachers should not be expected to deliver a hybrid teaching model – it must either be fully face-to-face or fully remote. Victoria has provided $60m in funding for schools to erect shade sails and create other areas that could be used for outdoor classrooms in government-funded and low-fee private schools. They say they will also have installed 51,000 air filters in schools by the start of term. Tasmania has also installed air filters in government schools. NSW said in October 2021 that the education department had bought 19,000 air purifiers, but they would only be distributed in air quality emergencies – such as bushfires over the summer. It’s focusing on “natural ventilation”. South Australia says doors and windows are to be left open to encourage ventilation and outdoor learning is “encouraged where appropriate”.

1/18/2022,"Almost immediately on entering St Helen’s churchyard I could see its most wonderful occupant. It’s a yew tree, at least of equal age to the adjacent 12th-century building, but reputed to be as old as Christianity itself. Like all veteran trees I’ve experienced, it is memorable not for its postcard beauty or elegance, and certainly not for its evocation of some Platonic ideal of the tree of life. What assails you is the monumental imperfection.  Its trunk appears to have been shorn of the wilder pubic epicormic growth common to this species, but it’s still a bristling hog’s-back of a bole. The thing surges as one muscular rising stem, but it also twists and ripples and buckles back on itself. By head height, any singularity in that eight-metre girth has dissolved into a chaos of lesser branches, some of which are dead or hollowed out with rot. Above, amid the detail of the fretwork foliage, all sense of human order is gone and what ascends there is magnificence entirely on its own terms. Yews, perhaps more than any other trees, possess something that gets to the heart of why we love these ancient veterans. Ironically, it is manifest most completely in a yew that stands just next to this oldest one at St Helen’s. This other monster is but 2.5 metres about its waist, and its upper canopy surges up then swoops down writhing like limbs about an octopus. This illustrates something noted by Richard Williamson in his book The Great Yew Forest: the species’ capacity to flow and sway in liquid shapes. Yews may be celebrated for wood harder than iron, but they often suggest many of the properties of water. They are, of course, like all plants, made largely of water, and we see in the oldest organisms both their obdurate, awkward centuries-long hold on existence, yet also the moment-by-moment green grace by which they capture photons of light and turn water to carbohydrate fuel for new life. They are both alive to the light of each passing second, but they store in those archives of wounded lignin a profound story of their lived past.
