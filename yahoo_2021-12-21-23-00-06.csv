12/21/2021,"Money, it seems, really can’t buy love. But in the case of Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, and his sixth wife Princess Haya, it can sure buy a lot of other stuff including the silence of her secret lover. In what is being dubbed as the biggest divorce settlement in U.K. history, the newly divorced Sheikh was ordered to pay some $734 million to his estranged wife in a case that has lifted the veil on what the super rich do in their spare time. Testimony, which can only now be reported under British court rules, suggests that Princess Haya, 47, who happens to be the sister of King Abdullah II of Jordan, “borrowed” a cool $7.5 million from her then 10-year-old daughter’s trust account to pay off her bodyguard, a former British soldier, with whom she was conducting an illicit affair. The princess’s security team had apparently blackmailed her to keep the tryst under wraps. “I was scared and that was the money available in that account,” the princess told the court according to British press accounts published Tuesday. The Sheikh, 72, divorced his youngest wife when he discovered the affair, which led to the divorce proceedings. Calling their life “truly opulent” and remarking on the “unprecedented standard of living enjoyed by these parties” the presiding judge ordered the wealthy ruler to pay the princess millions to carry out the lifestyle to which she and her children had become accustomed. A large payout in the record-breaking settlement is for security for the princess and her children—to protect them from the Sheikh who apparently found her unfaithfulness a capital offense. “Most importantly in this regard, and absolutely uniquely, the main threat they face is from HH himself not from outside sources,” the judge said, referring to the Sheikh as His Highness. “This is compounded by the full weight of the state that he has available to him as seen by his ability to make use of the Pegasus software, which is only available to governments.” The Sheikh used the software to hack the phones of the princess and her lawyers. The judge also scolded the blackmailers, who are not yet charged with any crime, saying, “This was clearly a most unsatisfactory episode. I realize I have not heard from the alleged blackmailers but nobody should be blackmailed and HRH must have been very frightened at this point.” The couple separated in 2019 when the Sheikh discovered his wife’s infidelity. Haya took the kids, now aged 14 and 9, to the U.K. While married, the ruler provided the princess with an annual $110 million budget for household expenses and nearly $12 million in allowance for each of the children. Haya originally asked for nearly $2 billion in maintenance. The court saw holiday snapshots of the family on their $400 million super yacht in addition to vacation pictures from their collection of villas and estates as well as shots of their custom-made Boeing 747 and matching helicopters all staffed by around 80 servants. The court was also told how one summer, the family of four spent more than $2 million—on strawberries. While the high dollar payout would surely have satisfied most divorcees—especially considering the circumstances of her infidelity—Haya was said to be disappointed not to have her haute couture wardrobe worth about $110 million or her $26 million jewelry collection returned to her from Dubai. The court was shown a photo of her walk in jewelry vault which she said had been stripped of the good stuff, leaving around $25,000 worth of “costume jewelry” the judge did offer to order returned. According to press reports, he asked her if there would be “any point” to do so, to which she said, simply, “no.” She will also not get her stable of race horses, but instead was awarded some $6.6 million to “buy a few reasonable horses and run them for several years.” Her lawyers had insisted that travel funds be allocated for the children, which the court awarded to the tune of $7 million a year, plus another $1.3 million for unspecified “leisure” activities. An additional $250,000 was earmarked for animals, including horses and ponies, and $130,000 for the children’s private tutors. A request for the couple’s son Zayed, aged 9, for money to purchase three new automobiles—in addition to the one he already owns— was denied with the judge telling the princess, “I do consider it an artificial edifice to talk of children of the ages of these children owning motor vehicles. Moreover, Zayed’s precious motor vehicle has now finally been returned to him.” Admitting that the circumstances of the divorce were highly unusual, the judge applauded the princess for wanting her children to have a “normal life,” adding that in his judgement he did his best “to a conclusion as to what is reasonable while remembering that the exceptional wealth and remarkable standard of living enjoyed by these children during the marriage takes this case entirely out of the ordinary.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

12/21/2021,"Madelyn Allen went missing in Utah on December 13 after travelling to see a man she met online. Police found her five days later covered in coal in a house basement, an affidavit said. Brent Brown, 39, was arrested on charges including kidnap and rape, a local report said. A missing Utah college student was found in the basement of a man now suspected of kidnapping and raping her, according to local reports. When police found her, she had no clothes and was covered in coal dust from the basement, the reports said. Madelyn Allen, a 19-year-old student at Snow College in Ephraim, was reported missing after she didn't return from a date with a man she met online, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Snow College Police Chief Derek Walk identified the man as Brent Brown, 39, in a press conference Sunday. Brown has since been arrested on charges including kidnapping, rape, object rape, and obstruction of justice, the local news station KSL reported, citing a police affidavit. During interviews with police, Brown said he met Allen on an online chat group for bondage sex, KSL said. According to the affidavit, after Brown picked up Allen on December 13, he took her phone and wallet, made her get naked, and tied her up while he went too work, the Tribune said. When Brown discovered police were looking for Allen, he threw her phone away, the Tribune said. Police said they managed to track Allen to a house in the village of Loa on December 18 by using cell tower data. The affidavit said that officers searching in Loa managed to spot someone who looked like Allen in a basement from outside. A man who answered the door, now identified as Brown, claimed to be alone, the Tribune said. But, per the outlet, police found Allen naked in the coal room covered in coal dust. Allen later told police that Brown raped her several times, the affidavit says, according to KSL. ""We don't have a lot of information about him,"" Walk said Sunday. ""We met him for the first time last night. We don't know how extensive his relationship or her knowledge of him is thus far.""

12/21/2021,"LONDON (AP) — A British court on Tuesday ordered the ruler of Dubai to pay his ex-wife and their children close to 550 million pounds ($730 million), in one of the most expensive divorce settlements in British history. The High Court said Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum must pay 251.5 million pounds to his sixth wife, Princess Haya Bint Al Hussein, and make ongoing payments for their children Al Jalila, 14, and Zayed, 9, underpinned by a bank guarantee of 290 million pounds. The total amount the children receive could be more or less than 290 million pounds, depending on factors including how long they live and whether they reconcile with their father. The settlement includes 11 million pounds a year to cover security costs for Princess Haya and the children while they are minors. Judge Philip Moor said the family needed “water-tight security,"" and that “absolutely uniquely,” the main threat to them came from Sheikh Mohammed, rather than outside sources. Haya, 47, fled to the U.K. in 2019 and sought custody of her two children through the British courts. The princess, who is the daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan, said she was “terrified” of her husband, who is alleged to have ordered the forced return to the Gulf emirate of two of his daughters. Sheikh Mohammed, 72, is also the vice president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and a major horse breeder. The founder of the successful Godolphin horse-racing stable, he is on friendly terms with Queen Elizabeth II. Haya, a graduate of Oxford University, is also a keen equestrian and competed in show jumping for Jordan at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. A separate British family court judge ruled in October that Sheikh Mohammed had authorized the hacking of Princess Haya’s phone during their legal battle. Judge Andrew McFarlane said the sheikh gave his “express or implied authority” to hack the phones of the princess and her attorneys using Pegasus spyware produced by NSO Group of Israel, the court said. The software is licensed exclusively to nation states for use by their security services. Sheikh Mohammed denied knowledge of the hacking. McFarlane earlier ruled that Sheikh Mohammed had conducted a campaign of fear and intimidation against his estranged wife and “ordered and orchestrated” the abduction and forced return to Dubai of two of his adult daughters: Sheikha Shamsa in August 2000 and her sister Sheikha Latifa, in 2002 and again in 2018. The divorce bill eclipses the 450 million pound settlement awarded Tatiana Akhmedova in her 2016 split from Russian billionaire Farkhad Akhmedov, at the time cited as Britain's most expensive divorce. Tuesday's settlement includes a holiday budget of 5.1 million pounds, an annual sum of just over 450,000 pounds for the children’s staff and around 275,000 pounds for their animals, including two ponies and a horse. It is possible, but rare, for financial divorce settlements to be appealed in England. A spokesman for Sheikh Mohammed said in a statement that the ruler “has always ensured that his children are provided for. The court has now made its ruling on finances and he does not intend to comment further.”",World/Associated Press,Dubai ruler must pay ex-wife $700M in divorce settlement,https://news.yahoo.com/dubai-ruler-must-pay-ex-122302362.html
12/21/2021,"“Look out for the trigger words,” the woman says. She’s perched on a chair in front of the room. She’s well-dressed yet funky with elegant boots, a demure sweater and some colorful jewelry. “‘Equality,’ ‘diversity,’ ‘inclusion,’ ‘marginalization,’... These words are CRT. If you see these words in your kids’ homework, you need to speak out.” I am in a meeting held by a local right-wing mom’s group. It’s an organization catering to mothers who are bent on protesting at school board meetings to stop the supposedly evil critical race theory agenda from being taught in public schools and address other typically conservative concerns. Critical race theory is not currently being taught in public schools. There are about 20 of us. We are all maskless, all (apparently) white, mostly women and all on the younger side. I’m in my early 40s and I seem to be the oldest person in the room. A group of children, including my son, the only one in a mask, are scampering merrily in a play area down the hall while a young woman with a baby in her front carrier keeps an eye on them. On the wall by the door of our seminar room is a sign. It says: “Children should be: Heard. Respected. Encouraged. Loved. Appreciated. Guided with Compassion. Given Freedom to Learn Without Coercion.” What exactly that last phrase means is ominously vague. For several years now I have been worried about the increasing right-wing views that I have noticed in my demographic (white suburban women). Before 2016, I always thought of Nazis as mainly historical villains that belonged in Indiana Jones movies or old news reels or the sad stories my grandfather told me. Now, however, as the last Holocaust survivors are dying, I am aware that fascism is creeping back into the world at large in terrifying ways. I wanted to know how I could fight against the appallingly stupid yet dangerously widespread disinformation that is entrancing many of my friends and neighbors. Basic facts about COVID-19 are being dismissed by whole states as part of the “liberal mainstream corporate media.” Bodies from COVID victims were stacking up in ICUs and filling the morgues back in 2020, yet I was still called a “child abuser” by people on the street because I made my son wear a mask. Why are people going nuts? Why are people dismissing science and history in favor of conspiracy theories? And, most importantly, how could we nudge the nation in a saner direction? I was especially curious about activist groups that specifically target suburban women. These groups seemed intent on making life more dangerous for my child. According to my local right-wing women’s group, masks should not be allowed in school. They told us to stop worrying about kids dying of COVID. They were also vocal about not wanting racism and its deep, formative history in the United States to be taught. Some of these people literally do not believe white privilege exists because, according to them, the Union soldiers who fought in the Civil War were overwhelmingly white. (No, I don’t understand that argument either.) Others feel parts of our country’s history shouldn’t be included in curriculums if it makes people ― namely white people ― uncomfortable. Every teacher I knew was struggling with COVID restrictions and dealing with students venting their post-pandemic trauma through increasingly disruptive behavior. School districts across the country were dealing with staffing shortages due to teachers burning out from stress. Why add to teachers’ difficulties by threatening school instructors who dared to teach topics like Jim Crow laws, the civil rights movement and the repercussions of slavery in America? Some of these people literally do not believe white privilege exists because, according to them, the Union soldiers who fought in the Civil War were overwhelmingly white. (No, I don’t understand that argument either.) To learn more, I joined a local right-wing Facebook group for moms. It’s a private group that requires aspiring members to answer some questions before they’re granted entry. One question was “Why do you want to join?” I replied, “I want to be more involved with my kids’ school.” A week passed and then a moderator for the group contacted me privately. “Can you be more specific about what issue most concerns you?” Yikes. Security was apparently very tight with this group. They weren’t going to let just any mom glide in using a few generic answers. “I’m mostly interested in issues that involve keeping kids physically in school,” I messaged back. “Zoom school was devastating for my kid and I don’t want that to happen again.” I wasn’t lying about any of that. It’s one of the few opinions I share with many conservative parents. The moderator sent me a thumbs-up emoji and let me into the group. Once inside, I found the members were all stripes of Republican and I was pleasantly surprised to see opinion was not monolithic in the group. Several moms argued against the more far-right posters. One woman posted an objection to children reading “To Kill a Mockingbird” in class. “Divisive Concepts,” she wrote with a broken heart emoji. Underneath was a screenshot of a direct message from someone who appeared to be a student that read, “I’m in English right now. We’re currently reading ‘To Kill a Mockingbird.’ There’s a part where Calpurnia brings the kids to church with her and another black woman is being extremely racist towards Scout and Jem. My teacher was saying it was not racism because white people have a higher power over black people in society and that black people can’t be racist.” There were several indignant emoji reactions in response to this post. One mom, however, pushed back. “Well,” she commented, “the woman at the church complained that Calpurnia had brought white children to the Black church, possibly one of the few places Black people felt any sense of freedom and safety. It’s a little absurd to call the woman racist, given the context.” This comment got a couple “likes” and no pushback. Another surprise I found in the Facebook group was that some huge media outlets were giving them a platform. One of the founders of the group posted that she had done an interview with The New York Times as part of a story on parental rights. The New York Times! I was dumbfounded. None of the women who ran the pro-Democrat “Indivisible” groups in my town had even managed to get an interview with the local paper! I scanned the comments and my eyes nearly popped out of my head. “It’ll be fine,” another mom wrote after the initial poster expressed concern about The New York Times possibly misquoting her. “It’s a lesson I learned the hard way after the BBC screwed me.” The BBC! The BBC was talking to these women? I had to know more. Unfortunately a few of the moms may have become suspicious of me. Perhaps I had “liked” too many comments by moms pushing back against the anti-CRT posts. Perhaps some moderators had found the very liberal comments that I had posted on other public news articles. In any case, when I expressed interest in joining an in-person roundtable discussion event, I saw that the location of the event suddenly disappeared. I messaged the group moderator about the event location. “Just a heads up,” she messaged back, “I think most people will not be masking. Is that something you’ll be comfortable with?” I wondered if she was trying to frighten me off. “Yes, that’s fine,” I replied. I never received the location, but luckily I had written it down before it disappeared from the event post. I drove to the meeting with my son. The group moderator had been right. When I joined the meeting, I saw that nobody in the packed room was masked. I gritted my teeth and sat down anyway. I was fully vaccinated and my son wore a mask. He was the only one. I listened to the speakers at the meeting while they discussed how to run for, campaign and pressure school boards. Many parents bemoaned how they had to pull their kids from public schools over mask mandates and instead enroll them in private schools. It was a common story. I got the impression that most of these families had income levels that allowed them to pay thousands in private school fees because they wanted to take a stand on masks. I was probably the poorest person there. There was a lot of anger directed at teachers. “Rat out these teachers,” one mother instructed. “Find a lawyer who can challenge these teachers.” Another woman disdainfully noted that teachers “don’t even know what they’re doing half the time. They just pull it off the internet.” A third woman said, “There is no discipline for teachers outside of taking away their credentials.” The battle lines were clearly drawn. I raised my hand. “What do you say to people who are like, ‘Oh, you’re gonna put bounties on teachers’ heads. You’re marching outside of school board members’ homes with guns. School board members are getting death threats and feeling terrorized’?” I could see several women visibly flinch at the word “bounty.” One woman said she disliked the term “bounty” but she could see the need for “monetary compensation” for those who turn in teachers that were doing things parents found unacceptable. “There are no repercussions for teachers who break the law,” she said. “If we have to offer monetary compensation for people to report teachers, I see no problem with that. It’s an incentive for people to wake up.” It wasn’t clear what laws these teachers were supposedly breaking. As far as I could tell, teachers ― like everyone else ― got punished if they broke laws. Another woman raised her hand. “Look, I know we want to change school boards,” she said, “but elections aren’t until 2023. What do we do until then? We just can’t sit around and let them attack our kids. We have to do SOMETHING.” I caught a gleam in the woman’s eye I didn’t like. Was there some flirtation with insurrection being suggested here? What, exactly, was she saying? Another woman nodded. “Listen, we’ve tried playing nice. But they just dig in their heels and dig in their heels. We have to start being not so nice.” One woman said she disliked the term 'bounty' but she could see the need for 'monetary compensation' for those who turn in teachers that were doing things parents found unacceptable. ... 'If we have to offer monetary compensation for people to report teachers, I see no problem with that. It’s an incentive for people to wake up.' I didn’t like where the discussion was going. The moderator guided the topic back to safer ground. “Be pleasantly persistent,” she smiled. “Be annoying. Be the woman at the school board meetings who always shows up. Be the person who, when the meeting organizers see you, say, ‘Oh, God, her again.’ Be that person. And please try to get people to vote in municipal elections.”  Fair enough. A lot of the roundtable debate felt like a Republican version of a Run for Something meeting. Run for Something was a movement started after Donald Trump won the presidency that was meant to encourage young progressives to start their own campaigns for local political office. This right-wing women’s group seemed to be following the same model, but there was an undercurrent of rage among the group members that I had never seen in a Run for Something meeting.  Despite my uneasiness, I couldn’t help but find myself liking the women in the room. They were charismatic. They were energetic. They had no problem letting my low-functioning autistic son play with their children, which is unfortunately rare among a lot of the other mothers I’ve encountered. But this made me even more uneasy. I realized these women were dangerous precisely because they were so friendly. Their condemnation of history lessons about Ruby Bridges and Jim Crow laws and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was repulsive. They were trying to suppress the truth by labeling the unassailable facts of racism in the U.S. as “divisive.” “Equality,” “diversity” and “inclusion” were not virtues to be celebrated but “trigger words” with a poisonous intent. This nefariously clever bit of relabeling disgusted me. There was a very clear far-right agenda at work here. Groups like the one I joined often appeal to mothers. The pandemic has hit moms especially hard. Lack of child care has resulted in a “she-cession” with thousands of women leaving the workforce to take care of their children. Lonely, frustrated, financially stressed people tend to be prime targets for radical groups. These right-wing women’s groups offer a sense of community and friendship to women who are isolated at home with their kids. It can be frighteningly easy for some people to start nodding along with all the rhetoric about the evils of critical race theory and COVID conspiracy theories if the women espousing them are also offering you coffee and friendship and child care ― and making you feel seen and heard. I am currently still a member of this local right-wing women’s Facebook group. It has helped me to understand where these people are coming from ― and just how motivated they are. My membership could end up being rescinded, however, as I plan to attend a few upcoming school board meetings to defend the accurate and honest teaching of all parts of American history, especially in regard to racism and what it has meant and means to be Black in this country. I can’t stop thinking about the gleam in that woman’s eye as she said, “We just can’t sit around and let them attack our kids. We have to do something.” Though some people think merely tweeting our outrage or frustration is productive (it’s not), those of us fighting against the far right need to be more aware of how energetic and organized they’re becoming and the lengths they’re willing to go to in order to get their way. Right-wing activists are attending school board meetings in hopes of transforming our children’s education, and, ultimately, their lives and the future of the United States. It’s time for us to be just as active to ensure this doesn’t happen. We must fight for our children’s safety and their right to learn our nation’s history ― even the ugly parts. Especially the ugly parts.  After all, when ugly history gets ignored, it tends to get repeated.

12/21/2021,"“The Daily Show” correspondent Jordan Klepper proved again there’s no shortage of “unique arguments” from anti-vaxxers for avoiding the shots. (Watch the video below.) In a continuing series, Klepper assembled the best responses from anti-vaccination rallies he attended. “The Daily Show” posted the “New Variants Edition” online Monday while the Comedy Central program takes a holiday break. Some of the anti-vaxxer reasoning might make you spit out your Christmas eggnog. One person claimed she had seen more people in the hospital after they got the vaccine. Another said he was getting his information from qualified sources, like “word of mouth” and the organic grocery store. But perhaps the best gift in this compilation is Klepper trying to get a Donald Trump supporter to understand that she’s rejecting a vaccine that her leader pushed to get developed at “warp speed.” And to those still vaccine-resistant as the omicron variant rages, this is our gift to you from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: “Current vaccines are expected to protect against severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths due to infection with the Omicron variant. However, breakthrough infections in people who are fully vaccinated are likely to occur. With other variants, like Delta, vaccines have remained effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalizations, and death. The recent emergence of Omicron further emphasizes the importance of vaccination and boosters.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

12/21/2021,"Former President Donald Trump confronted a crowd of supporters over vaccine skepticism. Trump told his fans to ""take credit"" for the vaccines instead of being against them. ""You're playing right into their hands,"" he said during his tour with Bill O'Reilly. Former President Donald Trump urged his supporters on Sunday to get a booster shot of one of the COVID-19 vaccines to protect themselves against the Omicron variant, telling them they were ""playing right into their hands"" by doubting the vaccines. Sitting alongside the former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly at a stadium in Dallas, Trump touted his administration's contribution toward developing the vaccines as part of Operation Warp Speed. ""Look, we did something that was historic,"" he said. ""We saved tens of millions of lives worldwide. We, together, all of us, not me."" He added that without the vaccine, millions more people would have died from the virus. ""I think this would have been the Spanish flu of 1917, where up to 100 million people died,"" he said. ""This was going to ravage the country far beyond what it is right now."" He then told his supporters to ""take credit"" for the vaccine, saying they shouldn't ""let them take it away."" ""You're playing right into their hands when you're sort of, like, 'Oh, the vaccine,'"" he said, referring to those of his supporters who have expressed hesitancy about or opposition to the vaccine. ""If you don't want to take it, you shouldn't be forced to take it — no mandates,"" he added. ""But take credit because we saved tens of millions of lives."" The former president went on to declare that he had gotten a booster shot himself, which elicited booing and jeering from the audience. ""Don't. Don't. Don't,"" Trump said of those booing. ""That's all right. It's a very tiny group up there."" Trump's comments marked a reversal from just months ago, when he told The Wall Street Journal that he was unlikely to get a booster shot. ""I feel like I'm in good shape from that standpoint — I probably won't,"" he told the newspaper in September. ""I'll look at stuff later on. I'm not against it, but it's probably not for me."" Since leaving office, Trump has been inconsistent on his vaccine messaging, largely holding off on talking about his administration's push to fast-track the inoculations after getting booed when he promoted the shots at an Alabama event over the summer. Trump also used to push the conspiracy theory that vaccines cause autism but began to change his tune amid measles outbreaks in 2019.
