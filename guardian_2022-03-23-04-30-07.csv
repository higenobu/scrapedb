3/23/2022,"Kim Little said Arsenal’s Champions League performances were “not good enough” in the first half of the season but that the team are a different beast going into Wednesday’s quarter-final first leg against Wolfsburg under the lights at the Emirates Stadium. Arsenal scraped into the last eight on head-to-head goal difference with Hoffenheim after twice losing heavily to the reigning champions, Barcelona – 4-1 in Spain and 4-0 at the Emirates Stadium. The team also suffered a surprising 4-1 defeat at Hoffenheim in their final group game. “Our performances have been much better in the last two months and the results have followed that,” Little said. “Towards the end of last year our performances in the Champions League weren’t good enough and we need to be mindful of that.” Arsenal nosedived after defeat by Chelsea in the FA Cup final and the second loss to Barcelona ruptured momentum. Jonas Eidevall’s side lost three of their next four games before a 90th-minute equaliser from Tobin Heath against Manchester City in the league restored some confidence. “I think we were disappointed with both our results against Barcelona and mostly our performance,” said Little. “Our results told one picture, but I think we all know as individuals we didn’t perform how we wanted. Tomorrow we’ll be braver and more proactive and learn from that experience so that when it comes to these slightly different games we’ll make sure we turn up and perform to our best, which is what will be required.” Since the 1-1 draw with City, Arsenal have won seven games and drawn two, against Manchester United and their title rivals Chelsea. That run, boosted by the return of injured players and January signings, has ensured that the team remain in the hunt in three competitions. But Eidevall cautioned that just taking part is not enough. “[We need to] be present, to take our chances,” the manager said. “It’s great that we’re in the position we are in, in three competitions, but we have to understand that at a club like Arsenal that’s not enough. We want to win trophies, that’s what we need to push for and that’s when we can be happy with results. That’s what separates the big clubs from the smaller clubs.” Wolfsburg are not Barcelona but they are a strong team and have huge Champions League pedigree, having reached five of the past nine finals, winning twice. “Wolfsburg is a top team, of course, but we play against top teams in the league: Chelsea and Manchester City are also top European teams, with their squads,” said Eidevall. “Barcelona has been an anomaly. Wolfsburg has a lot of fluidity. They are very very good on the counterattack and we haven’t played a team so far this season that has been that good on the counter. At the same time, I don’t think they have been exposed to our style of football either. “I believe in being proactive. If we set our gameplan right, then they should be changing to deal with our style.” The removal of the away goals rule this season helps attacking and proactive football, he believes. “Now it’s easier, it’s less challenging for the brain: be as good as you can over 180 minutes,” said Eidevall. “One of the better things with getting rid of away goals is you can keep attacking at home. If you’re winning 2-0 you can go for the third but before, you knew that you could be opening yourself up if you were too offensive. So hopefully we see more attacking football.” ",Sport/Football,Kim Little promises improved Arsenal for Champions League quarter-finals,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/22/kim-little-promises-improved-arsenal-for-champions-league-quarter-finals
3/23/2022,"Downing Street has condemned critics of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe who accused her of being “ungrateful” after she expressed frustration with the UK government for taking six years to secure her release from an Iranian jail. Days after touching down in Britain, Zaghari-Ratcliffe faced abuse on social media for saying it should not have taken so long for ministers to ensure she returned home safely. In a press conference in parliament on Monday, she said her husband, Richard, had suggested she thank the foreign secretary, Liz Truss. “I do not really agree with him on that level because I have seen five foreign secretaries changed over the course of six years,” Zaghari-Ratcliffe said. “How many foreign secretaries does it take for someone to come home? Five? It should have been one of them eventually.” A torrent of social media abuse was levelled at her in the aftermath. The prominent Brexit campaigner Arron Banks called the comments “charming” and said she was “stupidly in an hostile country that we sanction heavily”. He later posted a picture of Zaghari-Ratcliffe with a group of people including her local MP, Labour’s Tulip Siddiq, and the party leader, Keir Starmer, adding it was “hard to imagine she wasn’t politically active in Iran”. Another poster said: “See #ungrateful trending, after [£]400m spent to release her she takes aim at the government in a very polished vile manner. BTW – wish i looked that good when i am ‘broken’. #sendherback.” Others used the same hashtags and called her a “disgrace”, hitting out at what they called a “rude & ungrateful showing at her press conference”. Susan Hall, the leader of the Greater London authority Conservatives, also tweeted: “Errr what you really mean is that Iranians should not have unlawfully kept you as prisoner for 6 years. Now it appears that it’s Britains fault … in your eyes. I hope I am wrong but that’s what it feels like you are implying.” And David Bannerman, a former Conservative MEP, said: “I do hope she’s not biting the hand that saved her. Does she bear no responsibility for being in a country with such a nasty regime?” However, No 10 said Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been through an “unimaginable ordeal” during her time in Iran and defended her right to criticise the UK government. Boris Johnson’s spokesperson said: “Clearly, someone who has been through the sort of ordeal that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has, should not have to face any sort of abuse, social media or otherwise. “She has been through an unimaginable ordeal, and we are extremely pleased that she is now reunited with her family. And as a UK citizen, someone in a free and democratic country, she is rightly able to voice her opinion on any topic she wishes.” Jeremy Hunt, one of the foreign secretaries who tried to secure Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release, also said on Tuesday that people criticising her had “got it so wrong”. “She doesn’t owe us gratitude: we owe her an explanation,” he tweeted. “She’s absolutely right that it took too long to bring her home. I tried my best – as did other foreign secretaries – but if trying our best took six years then we must be honest and say the problem should have been solved earlier. “This kind of open scrutiny as to whether we could do things better is what happens in democratic, open societies.” David Lammy, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, also said: “Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe does not owe the government gratitude. The government owes Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe an explanation for what took it so long.”",News/News,No 10 condemns abuse levelled at ‘ungrateful’ Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/22/no-10-condemns-abuse-levelled-at-ungrateful-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe
3/23/2022,"Ofgem, the energy regulator, has a lot on its plate. Some 29 retail suppliers have gone bust in the past six months, Gazprom Energy, the Kremlin-backed company that supplies 20% of the UK’s non-domestic market, may soon need a quasi-nationalisation as corporate customers defect. Meanwhile, the country needs a new energy strategy, for which the technocrats’ input will be required. There ought still to be space, though, for Ofgem to address the issue that Martin Lewis, the money saving guy, raised with MPs on Tuesday: companies playing “fast and loose” by whacking up consumers’ direct debits beyond what’s justified by next month’s hike in the energy price cap to £1,971 for an average household. Which suppliers are guilty, Lewis was asked. Virtually all of them, he replied. One suspects he’s right because there is clearly a temptation for loss-making companies to improve their short-term cashflow positions in the current environment. Consumers are confused about the mechanics of how a 54% increase in the cap is supposed to translate into an adjustment in their direct debit payment. Meanwhile, price competition between companies has disappeared. In cases where an account is in arrears, a doubling of a monthly direct debit will be legitimate. But it was alarming that Lewis relayed tales of companies defending cap-beating increases for in-credit customers on the grounds that a further rise lies around the next corner. That tactic is a try-on. Yes, the Ofgem tariff probably will increase again in October (to £2,500, say latest projections) but that is not a reason to crank up balances in advance unless customers agree. Ofgem will do everybody a favour when it gets round to implementing stiffer rules on ring-fencing of consumer deposits, thereby reducing the incentive for companies to borrow, in effect, from bill-payers. In the meantime, a general regulatory warning to suppliers would be in order. If Lewis is correct, sneaky behaviour, to describe it generously, is going under the radar. Finally, a volunteer for the role of chair of THG, a job that will require more than telling founder, chief executive and landlord Matt Moulding to refrain from blaming his stock market troubles on wicked short-sellers. Charles Allen has had a wide-ranging career since his days as top man at ITV, but has probably never encountered a company quite like THG, or The Hut Group as it was. His arrival gives the appearance of governance normality, but it’s the substance of any reforms that will count. The easy part should be “refreshing” – in the statement’s polite language – a board where the crew of non-executives is too dominated by representatives of THG’s former private equity backers. As for improving transparency, yes, that’s obviously needed. Moulding has warbled unconvincingly about the supposed hidden value within THG’s Ingenuity division – the bit that provides “end-to-end technology services” to other people’s brands – but has never offered a divisional profit breakdown to justify the boasts. Err on the side of maximum disclosure. Until then, sceptical analysts are entitled to see Ingenuity only as a bits-and-pieces logistics set-up. The critical element will be Allen’s review of strategic options. Japanese group SoftBank surely isn’t going to exercise its option to pay $1.6bn (£1.2bn) for 20% of Ingenuity since THG’s entire market capitalisation is just £1bn these days. Instead, the pressing question is whether to go ahead with a demerger of the Lookfantastic-based beauty division, previously advertised as stage one of an eventual three-way split with the nutrition operation to follow. Is there any point to the corporate gymnastics if online retailers everywhere have lost their sky-high ratings? Allen would do well to talk Moulding out of his obsession with rejigging the structure. Just spend the next two years flogging more make-up and protein shakes and demonstrating there’s a real business at the heart of this baffling company. Visionary stuff can wait. It’s a minor moment in shopkeeping history: Kingfisher, the B&Q and Screwfix group, is the third British retailer to make an annual pre-tax profit of more than £1bn. The other two are Marks & Spencer and Tesco. Kingfisher enjoyed a push from lockdown and working-from-home factors and is not expecting a repeat this year: it is “comfortable” with analysts’ forecasts of £769m. But there is no reason to fear a M&S-style post-peak descent into crisis. DIY is a defensive sector and there are fews signs yet that the squeeze on household budgets is affecting demand for big-ticket items like kitchens and bathrooms. Meanwhile, the French Castorama and Brico Dépôt chains have been rewired and Screwfix still has scope for expansion. The long-term outlook looks more in line with comfortable Tesco-style dependability.",News/Business,"Ofgem may be busy, but it must address Martin Lewis’s points | Nils Pratley",https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/mar/22/ofgem-may-be-busy-but-it-must-address-martin-lewiss-points
3/23/2022,"The UK is running out of anti-tank weapons to send to Ukraine, the defence secretary appeared to tell Russian impostors posing as the Ukrainian prime minister, according to the latest video released by the pair. Downing Street has said it believes Russian state actors are responsible for the hoax, which saw an impersonator put through for a video call with Ben Wallace about the situation in Ukraine. Officials said they were prepared for more details from the call to be released in the coming days and that they anticipated this would be timed to cause maximum embarrassment to the British government, including at the Nato summit this week. Wallace took the call from Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexey Stolyarov, who are known as Vovan and Lexus, believing it was Denys Shmyhal, the Ukrainian prime minister, but became suspicious midway through the call. The pair are suspected of links to Russia’s security services, although they have denied this. The hoax callers also managed to get through to the home secretary, Priti Patel, and attempted to reach the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, who alerted the Foreign Office before the call request was accepted. Cabinet ministers and senior officials have been warned to be on their guard for further attempts to embarrass them in the coming days and weeks. Western officials believe Russia intends to step up tactics to divide the response of western allies to the invasion of Ukraine, including by embarrassment such as that caused by the hoax call to Wallace. They do not think the hoax was intended to be an intelligence-collecting technique, more a strategy of disruption. In a clip posted to YouTube, Wallace looks bewildered as the hoaxer says the NLAWs (next generation light anti-tank weapons) that the UK has supplied to Ukraine have failed. Wallace said he was in touch daily with Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov. “I don’t think ours have failed. I’ve got the details of ours. We’ve given you over 4,000. We’ve got more coming,” he said. “We’re running out of our own. I speak to Reznikov and text him every day.” In an earlier clip released on Monday, Wallace appears to be asked if he would support Ukraine’s nuclear aims; Russia has falsely claimed Kyiv has nuclear ambitions. A defence source said: “It’s a doctored clip. What you don’t hear is the defence secretary also saying that the UK can’t have anything to do with alleged Ukrainian nuclear ambitions, because the UK is committed to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.” However, the source did not dispute the substance of what Wallace appeared to have said.UK officials view this week as a crucial moment for western unity in the face of escalating attacks by Russia on civilian populations. Boris Johnson will attend the Nato summit in Brussels this week, along with the US president, Joe Biden, where he is expected to make the case for western allies to ramp up supplies of defensive weapons to Ukraine. The prime minister will tell allies at the Nato summit that there is an immediate imperative to support the Ukrainians now, according to UK sources, and that the Russian tactics of indiscriminately firing on civilian centres is inherently escalatory.",News/Politics,"UK running low on anti-tank weapons, defence secretary tells Russian hoaxers",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/22/uk-anti-tank-weapons-defence-secretary-russian-hoax-call
3/23/2022,"Jason Roy has been hit with a suspended two-match ban from international cricket and a £2,500 fine, the reasons for which are being kept out of the public domain by the England and Wales Cricket Board. Announcing the sanction on Tuesday, the ECB statement said the limited-overs opener had accepted a charge of bringing the game into disrepute handed down by its Cricket Discipline Commission, with the suspended element of his ban “dependent on good behaviour” over the next 12 months. The governing body has since said the CDC, which deals with disciplinary issues in the professional game and operates at “arm’s length”, is not prepared to provide any further details about Roy’s alleged transgression, raising questions over the transparency of the process. The statement read: “A disciplinary panel of the Cricket Discipline Commission has announced its sanction on Jason Roy after he admitted a charge of conducting himself in a manner which may be prejudicial to the interests of cricket or which may bring the game of cricket, the ECB and himself into disrepute, in breach of ECB Directive 3.3.” While Roy must pay his fine by the end of the month, he will be available for England’s next set of white-ball fixtures – a three-match away series against Netherlands in June – having most recently featured during the five-match Twenty20 series against West Indies in the Caribbean in January. The 2019 World Cup winner has since announced a break from cricket to “spend some quality time with my family” after pulling out of a £200,000 deal to play for Gujarat Titans in the Indian Premier League. In a statement released at the time of this IPL withdrawal, the 31-year-old said: “With everything going on in the world over the last three years, it’s added up and taken a toll on me. I feel it’s only right I spend some quality time with my family. As well as spending time working on myself and my game over the next couple of months leading into a busy year.” Surrey have not put a date on Roy’s return to county cricket but have said “he will remain in contact with the club during this period, with staff keen to assist him where possible.”",Sport/Sport,Jason Roy fined and given suspended two-match ban for undisclosed reason,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/22/jason-roy-fined-and-given-suspended-two-match-ban-for-undisclosed-reason
3/23/2022,"Ferry operator P&O has revealed it is paying £36.5m to cover compensation for the 800 seafarers it sacked without warning. It is understood staff who accept the payouts will be required to sign non-disclosure agreements requiring them not to disparage the company. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, told the House of Commons on Monday P&O was using the agreements to “keep the employees quiet”, and accused the company of acting in a “shameful and unacceptable way”. The company said it believed the settlement would be the “largest compensation package in the British marine sector”. The payouts being offered to dismissed staff are linked to their length of service with the company, and in some cases workers will be paid more than £170,000. P&O Ferries said 575 out of the 786 seafarers dismissed by the company are in discussions over the severance offers, with some receiving compensation equivalent to 91 weeks’ pay. It said more than 40 workers will receive more than £100,000, while no worker will receive less than £15,000. P&O is offering two-and-a-half weeks’ salary for each year of employment, as well as up to 13 weeks’ salary in lieu of notice, and a further 13 weeks’ salary because of the absence of a consultation period. It said the compensation package was the basis for offers made to workers at the time of dismissal. The announcement came as the government warned P&O Ferries could face prosecution over the sackings, while Shapps said ministers were reviewing all government contracts and dealing with the ferry operator and parent company DP World. A spokesperson for P&O Ferries said: “This has been an incredibly tough decision for the business: to make this choice or face taking the company into administration. This would have meant the loss of 3,000 jobs and the end of P&O Ferries.” The company said it had taken the “hard choice” to dismiss workers to guarantee the “future viability of P&O Ferries” and avoid large-scale and lengthy disruption to trade. Several P&O services including sailings on the Dover to Calais route remain suspended, while further protests are planned at ports around the UK for the coming days. The RMT union said on Tuesday that seafarers from abroad had been brought in to replace the 800 sacked British crew and were being paid as little as £1.80 an hour. P&O Ferries disputed the figures but declined to discuss the rates or give alternative rates and would not confirm whether it paid the minimum wage. The company said it would give support to sacked workers to find a new job either at sea or onshore, and would help those who could not find a new job.

3/23/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s regime hunts down the truth and celebrates lies. It threatens to jail those who describe honestly what is happening in Ukraine – a war. It brazenly denies documented attacks upon civilians. It concocts claims that the US and Ukraine plot to spread pathogens using migratory birds. It accuses others of its own sins: known for its willingness to fake events, it claimed that a heavily pregnant, visibly injured woman photographed leaving the bombed maternity ward in Mariupol was an actor. Those images, and her story, were captured by a photographer and a reporter from the Associated Press. The absence of information in a blockade has two goals, noted the reporter, Mstyslav Chernov: chaos, as people panic, but also impunity. “With no information coming out of a city, no pictures of demolished buildings and dying children, the Russian forces could do whatever they wanted.” Chernov has revealed that Ukrainian soldiers had risked their lives to extract him and his colleague from the city because Russians were hunting for them – hoping to force them to retract their work on camera and say that everything they had filmed was a lie. Russia has long sought to create its own reality, both by denying the truth and by inventing a new story. But at home its repression has dramatically expanded since the invasion. Facebook and Instagram have been banned, and Twitter blocked; access to foreign news media restricted. The introduction of a law that punishes spreading “fake news” with up to 15 years in prison prompted journalists to flee the country; independent outlets including the Meduza website and radio station Ekho Moskvy were blocked or shut down. Meanwhile, state media pumps out lies. That many of Russia’s denials and accusations are demonstrably untrue, deeply unconvincing or plainly ludicrous may not matter. The goal is to confuse, not convince. Russian disinformation penetrated our society long ago: working to promote Donald Trump’s campaigns in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections; meddling in the Brexit referendum. In some cases the aim has not been to further a particular cause, but to foster division, such as by amplifying strongly pro- and anti-vaccine messages. And beyond direct involvement, Russian meddling has contributed to a political style – most obviously, that of Mr Trump – which treats truth and fact as dispensable and irrelevant. The challenges are growing as technology develops. Last week, a deepfake surfaced: a short clip purporting to show Volodymyr Zelenskiy telling Ukrainian soldiers to lay down their arms. Though crudely executed, it points towards the new perils ahead. But sunlight remains a powerful disinfectant. The US, Ukraine and the UK have begun “prebunking”: warning when they anticipate that Russia will launch “false flag” operations, and revealing that a hoax video call had been made to the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, before the hoaxers released it. Disinformation campaigns must be fully investigated and exposed – something the UK signally failed to do in the case of the Brexit referendum, as the intelligence and security committee’s report on Russian influence noted. This may also mean ensuring that tech firms archive, not simply delete, disinformation, to ensure it can be traced back. But supporting those who get it right is as important as holding bad actors accountable. Above all, we must celebrate the courage of those who speak the truth, be they Ukrainians on the frontline like the AP team, or Russians like Marina Ovsyannikova, who disrupted Channel One’s main news broadcast, and the staff of newspaper Novaya Gazeta. As Chernov, the AP reporter, observed: “I have never, ever felt that breaking the silence was so important.”",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on disinformation: truth is a casualty of Russia’s war | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/22/the-guardian-view-on-disinformation-truth-is-a-casualty-of-russias-war
3/23/2022,"Boris Johnson cannot complain about the lack of an invitation to the European summit that begins on Thursday when his foreign policy is founded on a belief that such gatherings are not worth attending. It is true that Brexit doesn’t prevent the prime minister taking an active role in supporting Ukraine against Kremlin aggression. British military hardware is appreciated on the frontline. Mr Johnson can be in the loop of western diplomacy without a seat at the EU table. He will also be attending a Nato summit in Brussels on Thursday. In the Brexiter view, UK interests in Europe can be managed through the North Atlantic alliance and bilateral conversations with continental leaders. If that were true, and the EU were a strategic sideshow, Joe Biden would not be attending both summits in Brussels. But the US president recognises something that Mr Johnson denies – the European Council is a place where decisions of consequence are made. The prime minister would serve his country’s interests better from inside the room. The outbreak of war had raised hopes that the bombast and pettiness that has too often coloured British debate about the relationship with continental neighbours might be set aside. That hope was dashed when Mr Johnson made a speech last week drawing a grotesque comparison between Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion and the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Both reflected a common appetite for liberty, the prime minister said, mining a depth of crass cynicism to which even staunch critics did not think him capable of sinking. The trivialising thrust of the analogy was made all the more insulting in the context of Ukrainian ambitions to join the very European project that Mr Johnson casts as an imperial aggressor. For Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the EU and Nato are twin pillars of a democratic European order that stands in opposition to the worldview advanced by Vladimir Putin, where the rule of law is meaningless, might is right and borders are erased at a dictator’s whim. The concept of Europe as a democratic bastion was understood by countries of the former Warsaw Pact that sought Nato and EU membership as a package in the early 2000s. It is also understood by Mr Putin, who sees undermining EU solidarity as instrumental to the goal of sabotaging western interests. That is why he backed Brexit. That EU solidarity, resolute at the start of the war, is under strain. There are differences over the shape and pace of new sanctions against Moscow and how to meet the cost. The Baltic states and Poland, having more experience of Kremlin hostility, are hawkish in wanting to maximise pressure on Moscow. Germany resists embargos that might weaken European economies by limiting energy supplies and stoking prices. This week’s summit is likely to produce only conditional statements of tougher intent, not tougher action, disappointing those who would push harder against the Putin regime. That is a debate in which Britain would like a say. As one of the continent’s economic and military powers, it also has sway. Mr Johnson can be influential from outside a Brussels summit, but he has forfeited a say over the agenda. He has no one but himself to blame if decisions are made that he would have opposed had he been at the table.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Boris Johnson in Brussels: drop the Brexit rhetoric | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/22/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnson-in-brussels-drop-the-brexit-rhetoric
3/23/2022,"Jack Leach saw his winter begin with a “horrible” experience at the Gabba but he now feels central to England’s Test plans and wants to further develop a more attacking mindset after watching videos of Graeme Swann in his pomp. The left-arm spinner heads into Thursday’s deciding third Test against West Indies fresh from a gruelling workload of 94.5 overs during the drawn second Test at Kensington Oval that returned six of his 11 wickets on tour but saw both himself and England thwarted by Kraigg Brathwaite’s stickability. Leach’s duel with Brathwaite, in which the West Indies captain spent a combined 15 hours making scores of 160 and 56 not out, featured one belated success, in the first innings, when he spun one past the bat and bowled his man. It was something of a staring contest overall, however, with more than 200 dot balls chalked up and Leach sending down 40 maidens in the match. It is certainly a far cry from being taken for 102 runs in 13 overs in Brisbane last November and, though the slow surfaces have not offered more scope to run through a side, Leach feels he is learning plenty in the Caribbean. He said: “I felt horrible [after the Gabba]. But I trained the next day – [the spin coach] Jeetan Patel made me – and I think I surprised myself with how I deal with lows. Australia was a tough trip but I came back motivated and buzzing. “I’m trying to become the frontline spinner for England and I see the last couple of weeks as really valuable for my development on that road. It won’t be too long before I turn those three-fors into five-fors, especially in the second innings.” Leach is not sure what more he could have done to prise Brathwaite from his rock sooner in Bridgetown after seeing a couple of gloved deliveries drop short of the catchers. His greatest takeaway, looking ahead to the third Test, is the need to hold his length for longer periods and adapt the approach depending on the age of the ball and how the pitch changes. “A big focus for me is having that attacking mindset, always looking to take wickets,” he added. “I’ve been guilty of easing into spells in the past, earning the right to bowl and go at two runs an over. But that’s a negative mindset. “I’ve watched YouTube videos of [the former England spinner] Graeme Swann and how attacking he looks. He’s thinking: ‘How am I trying to get this guy out?’ and that’s important early on, the first 20 balls versus a batter is your chance. “But even if it doesn’t happen and I’m bowling 60 overs, it’s important to keep that mindset. There are times when the pitches here have felt very unresponsive, especially when the ball is older; the newer ball grips and [on some days] the pitches have felt tacky early on and spin. “On the third morning I thought I could drive it into the wicket to get it to spin but as the ball gets older, you have to give it more air. That’s something I’ll take forward, it’s not something you get used to in England. But that’s part of the journey of learning to be a spinner in Test cricket.” Leach has not played a home Test since September 2019 and, as he acknowledges, match-winning performances will ultimately decide how much a career of 21 caps and 79 wickets to date truly flourishes. Key to this, he believes, is buying into the “team-first” mantra being espoused on this trip. “That’s been the message to everyone really,” the 30-year-old said. “It’s all about the team and we all have a voice. Before I felt a lot of pressure on my own game and you forget you are contributing to something bigger. “It almost takes the pressure off your own game. I said openly to the group here that at Somerset I feel I belong, so I feel more comfortable giving my points of view. Maybe because I felt I belonged in terms of what I offer on the cricket field. “We wouldn’t be here if we are not good enough cricketers, but we can offer in different ways. I want to offer with wickets, but if I’m not, I want to be awesome in the field and try to score runs. I think maybe I got it a bit wrong beforehand. Not on purpose but I felt I was playing for my spot.” All eyes are now on the surface in Grenada and whether England will look to a second spinner in Matt Parkinson. The early suggestions are that the seamers will get more assistance than before, however, and so Leach, with 168 overs under his belt already this series, may be flying solo once more.",Sport/Sport,Jack Leach inspired by Graeme Swann in targeting frontline England role,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/22/jack-leach-inspired-by-graeme-swann-in-targeting-frontline-england-role
3/23/2022,"Tommy Robinson is potentially facing jail over possible contempt of court after failing to show up for a high court hearing where he was to be questioned about his finances after losing a libel case. The former English Defence League leader had claimed he was bankrupt after losing a libel case brought against him by Jamal Hijazi, who had been filmed being attacked at school in 2018. Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was sued after falsely claiming in Facebook videos viewed by nearly 1 million people that Hijazi was “not innocent and he violently attacks young English girls in his school”. Damages of £100,000 were awarded to Hijazi, who is now aged 18. His legal costs were thought to be more than £500,000. Robinson was subsequently ordered to attend a hearing at the high court to be questioned by a lawyer for Hijazi – but failed to attend the hearing at 2pm on Tuesday. Judge John Dagnall said that there may well be a reason for why Robinson, 39, was not present, but added “that is for another day” and said he could only refer the matter to a high court judge to consider if there had been contempt. “He knew perfectly well that this hearing was going to take place,” said Dagnall, adding that there had been a response from an email address which had been used to service notice to Robinson. He recalled that at a previous hearing it had been understood that documents and orders would be served on Robinson by email after he had complained that those living at his home address could be subject to threats “in light of his political activities” if it were used to serve further documents and orders. The judge added that he had to “dispense with a method of service” at Robinson’s own request, telling the hearing: “Therefore, anything that occurs with his email inbox is very much down to him.” Robinson clearly knew about the hearing, Dagnall added, not least because of various attempts by lawyers for Hijazi to contact him, and in any case he had replied to say he had received other documents. Ian Helme, for Hijazi, had previously told the court there was information “that what is stated in his bankruptcy application is not a full account of [Robinson’s] assets”. On Tuesday, the barrister said lawyers had “tried various methods to bring this to Mr Lennon’s attention” including sending documents by post to multiple addresses - including one in Tenerife and his ex-wife’s home – and to different phone numbers via WhatsApp. Helme also told the court that Robinson’s bankruptcy had now been discharged and so he would be personally liable for costs. Dagnall – a Queen’s Bench Master – said “all I can do” is refer Robinson’s non-attendance to a high court judge. “They may, if he or she chooses to do so, hold Mr Yaxley-Lennon in contempt,” he continued. “That is a matter for the high court judge.” However, Dagnall added that any committal for contempt of court could be suspended. Robinson has a number of previous convictions for contempt of court and disobeying court orders. Nick Lowles, CEO of Hope Not Hate, said the case was not just about money, but about justice. He added: “Tommy Robinson doesn’t care about the impact he had on the life of Jamal Hijazi and his family. He wants to continue to spread his vitriol and hate – and we are committed to stopping him.” In January, the anti-facist campaign group said it believed Robinson had access to assets worth up to about £3m through property acquisitions, investments, donations and book sales.",News/UK news,Tommy Robinson potentially facing jail after failing to attend high court,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/22/tommy-robinson-potentially-facing-jail-after-failing-to-attend-high-court
3/23/2022,"Rishi Sunak is expected to use his spring statement on Wednesday to announce measures to support UK households with growing challenges from the cost of living emergency and the war in Ukraine. Here are the key points to look out for from the chancellor’s update. Sunak will present new forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), with expectations for a weaker economic outlook as high inflation erodes consumers’ spending power. The consultancy Capital Economics expects a downgrade for GDP growth in 2022 from the 6% forecast in October to about 3.5%. Most attention will focus on the cost of living squeeze and workers’ pay. The Bank of England forecasts inflation will reach 8% this April, with a possible peak close to 10% later in the year. Recent stronger tax receipts mean the OBR is expected to forecast a substantial improvement for the public finances this year, possibly worth about £30bn compared with estimates made in October for borrowing of £183bn in 2021-22. Though the improvements could hand Sunak room to support families with living costs, he has also committed to reducing the deficit and national debt as a percentage of GDP. The chancellor is also likely to warn that high inflation adds to debt servicing costs. Sunak and Boris Johnson have previously insisted a planned 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance contributions for workers and their employers will not be jettisoned. However, some reforms to national insurance could be likely under heavy pressure from Conservative backbenchers. Sunak could choose to defer the increase planned for this April. Another option would be to raise the threshold at which workers start paying national insurance to help those on the lowest incomes. Anticipation is building that Sunak will cut fuel duty, possibly by as much as 5p, in response to surging pump prices since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Fuel duty is 57.95p a litre, plus 20% VAT. The Conservatives have frozen fuel duty for 12 years but campaigners say this clashes with net zero ambitions. However, petrol and diesel have risen by more than 40p and 50p compared with a year ago. The Resolution Foundation estimates a 10p fuel duty cut would cost about £5bn while only reversing around a quarter of the past year’s rise. The chancellor has faced calls to raise the value of universal credit by more than planned to support poorer households. The value of benefits is planned to rise by 3.1% in April, based on September’s inflation rate. However, the Bank of England forecasts inflation could hit 8% this April. Sunak cut universal credit by £20 a week in October, although he made some changes to expand the benefit. Should he take action, the chancellor could argue a bigger increase this year should warrant a smaller rise or even a freeze in 2023. Bosses have pushed Sunak to incentivise business investment and to help firms with high energy costs. The CBI has lobbied the chancellor to turn his “super deduction” – which offers tax savings on business investment – into a permanent deduction to encourage firms to spend. The business group says this is necessary to offset a rise in corporation tax from 19% to 25% planned from April 2023. The Treasury is expected to launch several consultations on Wednesday ahead of taking action at the autumn budget. Sunak could expand the £9bn package of energy support announced last month. A temporary VAT cut on energy bills – potentially funded by a windfall tax on oil and gas companies – could be used, as pushed for by Labour – although it is thought to be unlikely. Government sources have attempted to downplay the significance of the spring statement, saying measures worth £21bn this year and next have already been announced to help with living costs. The government is also raising the minimum wage from £8.91 to £9.50 an hour from April. While energy prices will rise sharply in April, household gas and electricity bills will then be frozen until October. Sunak could argue his existing schemes are enough for now, with time to assess if more help is warranted later in the year. However, holding back could be politically costly as the squeeze on households intensifies.",News/Business,What new measures could Rishi Sunak introduce in spring statement?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/22/what-new-measures-could-rishi-sunak-introduce-in-spring-statement
3/23/2022,"Environmentalists have launched protests against a Russian tanker bringing oil into New York, amid a flurry of oil imports into the US before a ban on oil and gas coming from Russia comes into force. Activists from Greenpeace set out in two boats to intercept the Minerva Virgo oil tanker on Tuesday morning as it set about unloading its cargo in the port of New York. The green campaign group, which unfurled a banner reading “Oil fuels war” in front of the 50,000-ton tanker, had already confronted the Greek-flagged vessel on Sunday as it made its way to the port. “The oil and gas companies that are responsible for our skyrocketing gas prices are the same companies that are fueling conflicts and death around the globe,” said Anusha Narayanan, climate campaign director at Greenpeace USA, who was on one of the boats. “A more peaceful, livable, and equal future depends on breaking our addiction to volatile and conflict-driven fossil fuels.” The protest aimed to highlight how the US is continuing to import oil from Russia after Joe Biden’s decision on 8 March to ban the intake of oil and gas from Russia in what the US president called a “powerful blow to Putin’s war machine”. The White House allowed a 45-day grace period for oil imports after the announcement, meaning that ships bringing fossil fuels from Russia won’t be able to dock at American ports from 22 April. Some oil companies have decided to “self sanction” by not taking product from Russia, although there have been exceptions, such as Shell buying a heavily discounted consignment of Russian oil, before apologizing for doing so. This grace period is seeing plenty of activity, with a Greenpeace tracker showing that dozens of Russian oil shipments have headed towards the US and Europe. At least a dozen tankers that have left Russian ports have either unloaded in the US or are about to arrive. This includes the Kronviken, a crude oil tanker anchored near Houston, the Riverside, another crude oil tanker heading for Florida, and the Balla, a tanker bound for Los Angeles. Narayanan repeated climate campaigners’ demand for Biden to invoke the Defense Production Act, normally used in times of war to compel companies to churn out weapons, to force businesses to produce more solar panels, wind turbines and other clean energy technology. “True energy independence can only come from renewable energy,” she said. The administration has, however, been more focused on rebutting claims by the oil industry and Republicans that Biden has declared “war” on domestic fossil fuel production. The Biden administration has given out oil and gas drilling leases at a faster rate than Donald Trump did, although many of these leases on public land remain unused by the industry.",News/Environment,Activists protest tanker as Russian oil imports flow into US ahead of ban,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/22/activists-protest-tanker-russian-us-ban
3/23/2022,"The government has drawn up plans to take over the funding of the UK operation of the Russian energy giant Gazprom, should the state-backed supplier collapse as customers cut supply contracts due to the invasion of Ukraine. Officials have drawn up contingency plans to implement a financial lifeline for the business energy supplier, which has contracts in place with about two-thirds of the UK’s heaviest gas users, in the event that Gazprom Energy enters administration in the next few weeks. Gazprom Energy, which is facing a customer exodus following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, has tested the market’s appetite for a buyer as the company considers financial options. If Gazprom were to fail, it would be put into taxpayer-funded special administration – as occurred with Bulb, Britain’s seventh-biggest residential energy supplier, in November – because it is too large to be handled by energy regulator Ofgem’s “supplier of last resort” process. Bulb remains in administration with a taxpayer loan of £1.7bn. “We are aware that Gazprom Energy has a large presence in the non-domestic energy retail market,” said a government spokesperson. “Gazprom’s retail business continues to trade in the UK and customers should exercise their own commercial judgment with regards to energy supply contracts they have in place at the moment.” The firm supplies 100,000 sites across the UK, Ireland, France and the Netherlands, with offices in London and Manchester and about 350 staff. It accounts for about a fifth of the energy consumed by UK businesses, including councils and the NHS, but its clients are concentrated in industries such as ceramics, glass and steel. Earlier this month, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said that the NHS in England must stop using gas supplied by Gazprom. Merton council in London, and Suffolk county council have also said that they were attempting to break gas supply contracts with the company. Nishma Patel, the policy director at the Chemical Industries Association, said that members of her group had been in discussions with the government about the future of Gazprom Energy. The Federation of Small Businesses said that it had been warning the government for weeks that energy-intensive companies, from steel to fertiliser, could face financial issues if Gazprom is put into special measures. Richard Leese, the chair of the Energy Intensive Users Group, said that businesses that had hedged big price increases in the market with deals with Gazprom Energy needed to be protected. “It’s really important that those healthy businesses, that have taken the responsible thing to do, which is hedge their energy exposure, and did it with Gazprom, that needs to be honoured in terms of contractual obligations,” Leese told a panel of lawmakers on Tuesday. “The prices need to be honoured when, or if, that business gets transferred to an administrator or new ownership.” In a statement on its website, Gazprom Energy said that it was in contact with industry regulators but was not aware of any plans to move the company to government-controlled special administration. “We are in constant contact with the relevant regulators and are unaware of any decision taken to place Gazprom Energy under government control,” it said. “As one of the largest active members of the GB gas market, Gazprom Energy takes its responsibilities to ensure stability and protect customers seriously. Ofgem must consider all possible scenarios and formulate plans to respond to whatever events unfold – this is entirely normal.”",News/Business,Ofgem plans for Gazprom Energy takeover after customer exodus,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/22/ofgem-plans-for-gazprom-energy-takeover-after-customer-exodus
3/23/2022,"A judge terminated Amanda Bynes’ conservatorship on Tuesday, ending the legal arrangement that has given the former actor’s mother control of her estate and personal affairs for nearly a decade. The 35-year-old filed a petition last month, with support from her mother and psychiatrist, to end the conservatorship she was placed under in 2013 after she was forcibly hospitalized on a psychiatric hold. “I’m excited for her. She is excited,” Bynes’ attorney, David A Esquibias, told Variety on Monday. “We’re all excited and we’re all anxiously looking forward to Amanda living a life as a private and normal citizen.” On Friday, the Ventura county judge overseeing the case had already indicated he intended to end Bynes conservatorship. “Petitioner has provided facts that the conservatorship is no longer needed,” Judge Roger L Lund wrote in Friday’s tentative ruling. Bynes starred in Nickelodeon’s All That and the Amanda Show and films such as What a Girl Wants and She’s the Man, before announcing her retirement from acting in 2010. Bynes was placed on a psychiatric hold in 2013 after reportedly starting a small fire, and a judge granted her parents a temporary conservatorship that was extended multiple times in the years since. In the years before the conservatorship was put in place, tabloids had seized on her legal troubles, which included hit-and-run and DUI charges. Bynes has spoken out about mental health struggles, saying she was diagnosed “bipolar and manic depressive”. In a 2018 interview, she told Paper Magazine she struggled with body image issues and drug abuse that affected her behavior and mental health and “ruined” her life. Bynes is now sober, and has earned an associate degree from the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising. She’s currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree, and gotten engaged. She’s lived in a “structured community for women in need” since 2020, according to Variety, where her lawyer said she’s “done very well in a very short period of time that she’s been there” and she is now able to live independently. In a statement to People on Tuesday, Bynes shared her appreciation for her fans. “Following today’s decision by the judge to terminate my conservatorship, I would like to thank my fans for their love and well wishes during this time. I would also like to thank my lawyer and my parents for their support over the last nine years,” she said. “In the last several years, I have been working hard to improve my health so that I can live and work independently, and I will continue to prioritize my well-being in this next chapter.” Bynes’ effort to end her conservatorship comes months after Britney Spears years-long battle to end her own. A judge liberated the star from the nearly 14-year conservatorship in November in a major triumph for Spears and the #FreeBritney movement, a once-dismissed fan-led campaign that brought attention to Spears’ situation and cast a harsh spotlight on the controversial legal arrangement. Disability rights advocates have said the movement brought an unprecedented level of attention to conservatorships, fueling efforts to dramatically reform conservatorships in California.",News/US news,Judge terminates actor Amanda Bynes’ nearly decade-long conservatorship,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/22/amanda-bynes-judge-terminates-conservatorship-latest
3/23/2022,"A trophy hunting import ban will be brought forward in coming months despite opposition from Conservative backbenchers, the environment secretary has said. George Eustice told animal welfare campaigners of the commitment after rumours that a bill banning the import of parts of endangered animals shot abroad had been stopped. The trophy hunting import ban was a Tory manifesto commitment for this parliamentary session. Eustice said the government was “absolutely committed to” bringing the bill forward. The government has said the bill has been delayed, claiming parliament does not have enough time this session to pass the law. Eustice said it would be a priority piece of legislation when the new session opens later in spring. “While we won’t be introducing the animals abroad bill in this session as we are out of time, we will be looking at a range of vehicles for legislation on these important issues in the next session,” said Eustice. However, he added that the pledged bans on imports of fur and foie gras, which have been hugely unpopular with backbenchers including Jacob Rees-Mogg, are not a sure thing. Eustice said: “I know you’re probably going to ask me what’s going to happen on fur and foie gras but I can’t do that today.” Government sources have said the proposed bans are to be stripped from the animals abroad bill. Instead, they will likely have to be brought forward as private members’ bills, sponsored by individual MPs, and will no longer be a Conservative party commitment. Queen guitarist and animal welfare campaigner Brian May said he was disappointed by the government weakening animal welfare legislation. He told the Guardian: “I am disappointed. I’m always disappointed when it comes to animal welfare bills. We need to look at our attitude when it comes to animals – there’s so much talk by this government, they’re always making grand promises, but there’s so little action. Time and time again legislation which would protect animals is torpedoed. Or they take bits out and make it toothless and not fit for purpose.”",News/UK news,UK trophy hunting import ban to be brought forward,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/22/uk-trophy-hunting-import-ban-to-be-brought-forward
3/23/2022,"Do try to be appear calm when putting your baby in their cot, even if it’s the last thing you feel. Don’t get obsessed with them having daytime naps. Do have a consistent wake time. And above all, sleep experts say, try not to feel guilty or anxious if your little one is waking up time and again through the night. That is half the battle, said Prof Helen Ball, director of Durham University’s Infancy and Sleep Centre. A fractious baby really is a normal baby. “People do feel as if they must be doing something wrong. That they must be parenting improperly somehow. “The ones who sleep through the night from an early age and never wake up, they are very rare. Although they are the only ones you ever hear about.” The centre will next week launch a new kit for NHS health professionals that they hope will help new parents better deal with sleepless nights. Sleep – or the lack of it – is one of the main concerns new parents have, yet NHS health visitors and community nurses receive little or no training on the subject. Research showed that practitioners did not feel confident discussing strategies with parents, said Ball. “The only recourse they had really was to their own experience.” Ball said popular beliefs that babies should sleep through the night still held sway but were based on studies conducted in the 1950s and 1960s when babies routinely slept in another room so parents could be unaware of their baby waking up. “We know that it’s normal for babies to wake and feed at night throughout at least the first year.” The new guidance, Sleep, Baby & You, is based on the Australian Possums Sleep Program, which teaches parents to manage expectations, to reduce negative thinking and encourages responsive infant care. “Some of it is about framing what is normal or reframing expectations about what is normal and what we don’t need to be anxious about,” said Ball. “Some of it is helping parents on how to cope. As in … ‘If this is normal and we’ve got to deal with this, how are we actually going to cope with this for several months?’” It includes practical guidance and tips. For example, the importance of a baby being dialled down in order to fall asleep. If you are wound up then the baby will pick up on that, said Ball. “You might have to act calm even if you’re not calm.” Babies really like comfort and contact so cuddle the baby until they calm down and don’t put them in the cot as they’re screaming. Health professionals should encourage parents to avoid an obsession with daytime naps and suggest that naps happen on the go. Ball said having a consistent wake time was more important than having one for bed time. “There’s lots of information about how sleep works that the general public often hasn’t encountered before,” she said. The guidance is important, Ball said, because lack of sleep “has been linked to increased symptoms of depression and anxiety among new mothers and fathers”. It differs from the various forms of sleep training that exist, easily found online or available privately, which give tips on how to get baby to settle down during the night. Some methods favour the baby being in a separate room and parents not responding when the baby cries. Others talk about popping in to see them at increasingly longer intervals. Others say the baby should be in the same room but you’re not meant to respond when they wake. “Many parents don’t like the idea of not being responsive when their child is requesting their help or attention,” said Ball. “They don’t want sleep training but they want to know what else can they do.” The guide will be launched at the centre’s annual conference on Monday, which will celebrate 22 years of world-leading research into infant sleep. Ball said she and the centre had been working on the training tool, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, for nearly four years. “I wanted to find a support programme that NHS staff could use to help parents who are struggling with infant sleep.”",News/Society,Crib sheet: experts issue advice for new parents to cope with sleepless nights,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/22/crib-sheet-experts-issue-advice-for-new-parents-to-cope-with-sleepless-nights
