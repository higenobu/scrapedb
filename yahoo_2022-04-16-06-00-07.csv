4/16/2022,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Ri Chun Hi, North Korea’s most famous state TV anchor, has announced major events for decades, including nuclear and missile tests and the death of a leader, with an instantly identifiable, passionate voice. The anchor, dubbed the “pink lady” abroad for her bright traditional Korean attire, became the topic of official North Korean media herself Thursday after leader Kim Jong Un gave her a luxurious residence and asked her to continue to serve as the voice of his ruling Workers’ Party. Experts say Kim is providing special treatment to elite North Koreans to boost their loyalty as he grapples with the pandemic, a troubled economy and a stalemate in nuclear diplomacy with the United States. “(Kim) said it is the sincerity of the party that it would spare nothing for a national treasure like her, who has worked as a revolutionary announcer for the party for more than 50 years since her girlhood,” the official Korean Central News Agency said. Kim expressed his “expectation that she would as ever vigorously continue her work in good health as befitting a spokeswoman for the party.” Kim met Ri, who is about 79, on Wednesday after inaugurating a newly built riverside terraced residential district in Pyongyang, the capital, KCNA said. It said houses in the district were presented to Ri and other people who have given distinguished service to the state. North Korea often inaugurates construction projects to mark key state anniversaries. Friday is the 110th birthday of Kim’s late grandfather, state founder Kim Il Sung. It’s the most important anniversary in North Korea, which has been ruled by three generations of the Kim family since its foundation in 1948. The new housing area is where Kim Il Sung’s official residence was located until the 1970s. Pyongyang is North Korea’s showcase city, and its elite residents enjoy relatively affluent lives compared with people in remote rural areas where many still suffer from poverty and malnutrition. A majority of North Koreans who have fled the country in the past two decades have come from its northern regions close to the border with China. “By giving houses to those who have been faithful to him, Kim Jong Un would want to further bolster their loyalty and internal unity,” said Moon Seong Mook, an analyst with the Seoul-based Korea Research Institute for National Strategy. “Ri Chun Hi is a clear example of such people as she’s strongly propagated his nuclear and missile tests and served as a sort of bugler for him.” Kim toured Ri’s house with her and held her hand as they descended the stairs. Ri said she felt her new house is like a hotel and that all her family members “stayed up all night in tears of deep gratitude for the party’s benevolence,” according to KCNA. Ri later used her trademark over-the-top speaking technique to narrate a state TV video of Kim showing her the house. Ri joined state TV in the early 1970s when the country was still governed by Kim Il Sung, and she has gradually become the face and voice of the country’s propaganda-driven news broadcasts. Her close ties to Kim were shown last year at a government foundation anniversary ceremony when she watched from an elevated veranda right next to Kim, and at one point put her hand on his shoulder and whispered to him. At another event, she was the first person to shake Kim's hand before holding his arm and posing for a group photo. Moon, the analyst, said Ri receives Cabinet member-level treatment at home, appears healthy and is expected to continue to handle key televised announcements for at least the next few years. Ri's passionate, effusive style has sometimes generated laughter in other countries. In 2011, a Taiwanese TV station apologized after one of its newsreaders mimicked the tone Ri used when she announced the death of Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il. Since inheriting power upon his father's death, Kim Jong Un, 38, has led North Korea with absolute authority. But he is facing one of the toughest moments of his rule after the coronavirus pandemic shocked an economy already in dire shape from mismanagement and U.S.-led sanctions. Analysts say recent missile tests were meant to advance his weapons arsenal and pressure the U.S. into recognizing North Korea as a nuclear state and relaxing international sanctions.",World/Associated Press,Kim gives North Korea's most famous newscaster a luxury home,https://news.yahoo.com/kim-gives-north-koreas-most-080406035.html
4/16/2022,"A man in India has died by self-immolation after his boss reportedly demanded to have sex with his wife in exchange for a transfer.

Gokul Prasad, a 45-year-old technical lineman, was feeling distressed after his boss, junior engineer Nagendra Kumar, offered to process Prasad’s transfer if he sent “his wife [over] for a night.”

Both were employed at the Palia power station of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPCL) in Lakhimpur Kheri, India.

Prasad had asked for a transfer so he could work closer to home and not commute as much, according to his wife.

On April 9, Prasad proceeded to pour diesel fuel over his body and light himself on fire in front of Kumar’s office. He was rushed to the hospital where he succumbed to his injuries and died the day after.

Before his death, Prasad recorded a video complaining about years of harassment and work abuse that he received from Kumar and his aide. Prasad claimed that Kumar was abusing his power, and he blamed him and his aide for his later death.

Prasad said he reported the abuse to the police, but he did not receive assistance and “nothing happened.”

Gokul’s wife explained that he was harassed by Kumar and his aide for three years before falling into “depression” while “taking medication.”

“He went into depression, and started taking medication, but they did not spare him. He was transferred to Aliganj and was facing difficulty in traveling. So he asked for a transfer closer home. They told him, ‘get your wife to sleep with us and we will get you transferred,’” Gokul’s wife said.

She also claimed that nobody came to help Gokul when he set himself on fire, and Kumar had “stood there and watched.”

Sanjiv Suman, a senior police officer, stated that Kumar and his aide are now facing charges for abetment to suicide and intentional provocation under the Indian Penal Code. Both have been suspended from UPCL.

“The lineman had alleged that the junior engineer used to demand money and made vulgar statements when he sought a transfer. We have registered a case. At the department level, the junior engineer has been suspended and an inquiry ordered. The case has been registered under the abetment to suicide charge,” Suman said.

4/16/2022,"Four men have been arrested after one of the accused’s phones was discovered to contain a video of them gang-raping a Bengal monitor lizard at the Sahydari Tiger Reserve in Maharashthra, India.

CCTV footage from the Maharashtra Forest Department showed the four men lurking around the forest and trespassing into the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve, which was created by the Indian government in 2008 to conserve Bengal tigers.

In addition to the video of the men sexually abusing the monitor lizard, officials also found photos of various animals such as porcupines and deer on the mens’ phones.

Bengal monitor lizards can grow up to five and a half feet long and weigh almost 16 pounds. They are currently categorized as reserve species under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.

Forest guards initially only caught one of the accused, while the others fled. The remaining three were later found in Hativ village in the Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra. Officials said the men came to Kolhapur’s Chandoli village from Konkan to hunt.

The four hunters have been identified as Sandeep Tukram, Pawar Mangesh, Janardhan Kamtekar and Akshay Sunil.

The case was taken to the Indian Penal Court to discuss proper legal action and charges against the four men. According to the Indian Penal Code, Section 377 states that anyone who voluntarily commits intercourse with an animal “shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.”

4/16/2022,"Days before his birthday in August 2019, an employee at a Kentucky-based laboratory asked his office manager to not arrange a celebration for his birthday. It wasn’t the fear of getting older, but rather an anxiety disorder that can spur “panic attacks in stressful situations,” according to court documents. The employee, who was hired in October 2018 by Gravity Diagnostics, did not want a celebration because “being the center of attention” can trigger his disorder, the documents state. When the company threw him a lunchtime party against his wishes, it triggered a panic attack and he left abruptly to spend his break in his car. Four days later, after his office managers confronted him about his reaction to the party, he was fired from the Northern Kentucky company, court records show. He eventually sued Gravity Diagnostics, and this week, a jury awarded the man $450,000 in damages for his lost wages and emotional distress. An attorney for Gravity Diagnostics did not immediately respond to a request for comment by McClatchy News. Gravity Diagnostics is based out of Covington, Kentucky, and says it provides “innovative laboratory testing” for physicians and patients. Julie Brazil, the founder and chief operating officer of Gravity Diagnostics, claims it was the other employees who were victimized, she told Link NKY. “My employees de-escalated the situation to get the plaintiff out of the building as quickly as possible while removing his access to the building, alerting me and sending out security reminders to ensure he could not access the building, which is exactly what they were supposed to do,” Brazil told Link NKY. “As an employer who puts our employee safety first, we have a zero-tolerance policy and we stand by our decision to terminate the plaintiff for his violation of our workplace violence policy. When the employee left the office on Aug. 7 to spend the remainder of his birthday lunch in his car, he texted his office manager asking why she failed “to accommodate his request (to) ... forego the standard birthday celebration,” his attorney states. A day later after he arrived for work, he was called into a meeting with two superiors, who “confronted and criticized” him for how he reacted to the birthday party he did not want, according to the lawsuit. This caused him to have another panic attack. He was sent home from work for the next two days and later apologized for having the panic attack. On Aug. 11 he received an email stating “he was being terminated because of the events of the previous week,” the lawsuit states. His attorney said Gravity Diagnostics caused him to suffer “from a loss of income and benefits and emotional distress and mental anxiety.” The lawsuit was filed on grounds of disability discrimination and retaliation. The $450,000 he was awarded includes $120,000 for lost wages and $300,000 for “past, present and future mental pain and suffering, mental anguish, embarrassment, humiliation, mortification and loss of self-esteem,” court records show. His attorney, Tony Bucher, said he was happy to get his client “the vindication that he deserved.” “Few people will know how much courage it took for him to take this case all the way to trial,” Bucher said in a statement to McClatchy News. “More than the financial award, I believe (he) was so happy and relieved that the jury recognized that he was not some violent and menacing person and that it was not okay for Gravity Diagnostics to just assume that he was without any evidence to support those misconceptions.” Gravity Diagnostics will appeal the verdict, Brazil told Link NKY, based on “discovery of juror misconduct violating trial judge’s orders.” Job offer revoked after drug test reveals man’s ADHD medication, Texas lawsuit says ‘Hostile work environment’ at Activision Blizzard led to employee suicide, lawsuit says Man faking back injury got $730K in disability — but was caught weightlifting, feds say",U.S./Lexington Herald-Leader,"Employee’s unwanted birthday party nets him $450,000 after lawsuit against KY company",https://news.yahoo.com/employee-unwanted-birthday-party-nets-140433784.html

4/16/2022,"By SungHyuk An, Yeni Seo and Josh Smith SEOUL (Reuters) - For people in many countries, living in a penthouse is the dream. In North Korea? Not so much. Leader Kim Jong Un keeps building outwardly glamorous high-rise apartment buildings in the capital, Pyongyang, with the latest being an 80-storey skyscraper completed this week. But defectors and other North Koreans say that unreliable elevators and electricity, poor water supply, and concerns about workmanship mean that historically few people have wanted to live near the top of such structures. ""In North Korea, the poor live in penthouses rather than the rich, because lifts are often not working properly, and they cannot pump up water due to the low pressure,"" said Jung Si-woo, a 31-year-old who defected to neighbouring South Korea in 2017. In the North, he lived on the third floor of a 13-storey building that lacked an elevator, while a friend who lived on the 28th floor of a 40-storey block had never used the elevator because it was not working, Jung said. Asked about the new 80-floor skyscraper opened this week, Jung said he thought Kim was just showing off. ""It's to show how much their construction skills have improved, rather than considering residents' preferences,"" said the university student. North Korea assigns housing, with buying and selling of homes or apartments technically illegal in the socialist state. But experts say the practice has become common, dabbled in mostly by those who benefited from the spread of private markets under Kim. He has vowed to improve construction quality and build tens of thousands of new apartments. Its economy has been hammered by self-imposed border closures against COVID-19, natural disasters, and international sanctions for its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, which the United States says draw limited resources away from meeting people's needs. On Wednesday, state media said the first 10,000 new apartments had been completed in Pyongyang, from a target of 50,000, and touted the speed of their completion, including the 80-floor skyscraper. Workers ""guaranteed the quality of construction"" and the new apartments and other buildings meant for use in education, public health and welfare services would further help make the capital a ""people first"" city, state news agency KCNA said. On Thursday state media showed Kim inaugurating another housing cluster, this time for members of the elite, including a famous TV anchor. They were low-rise buildings, each only a few floors tall. PROGRESS TO BE MADE The power supply improved significantly under Kim, spawning some new night life opportunities, but North Korea still grapples with shortages and sometimes shoddy infrastructure. Many have turned to individual solar panels for the spells without power. That has brought a rash of small items of consumer electronics, but cannot power amenities such as elevators and water supply. Lee Sang-yong, the editor in chief of Daily NK, a Seoul-based website that reports on North Korea, said his sources reported that the apartments for regular people were not ready to live in. Windows had only frames and water taps, though installed, were not working, but the recently completed luxury homes come complete with furniture and utensils. To ensure the new highrise apartments are popular, North Korea will have to further improve electricity and water supplies, and overcome worries about the quality of construction, he added. Jung said when he lived in Pyongyang, most elevators worked just twice a day, during peak commuting hours from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m., and the same timing in the evening. Low water pressure often forced those living on higher floors to carry water upstairs from the ground level, or install their own special pump machines, he added. During the last major international media tour arranged by the government, in 2018, the elevators operated at the 47-floor Yanggakdo International Hotel, but there was no electricity on dozens of floors where North Korean staff stayed. At the time, two North Korean officials acknowledged to Reuters that the upper levels of the highrises in one of Kim's recently opened pet construction projects, on Mirae Scientists Street, had few takers, because of the worries over elevators. ""No one wants to risk having to climb for an hour,"" one said.

4/16/2022,"A Chilean man has appealed his 28-year prison sentence over the murder of his Japanese ex-girlfriend in France in 2016.

Nicolas Zepeda, 31, lodged the appealon Wednesday, a day after a local French court gave him his sentence and determined that the murder was premeditated, as prosecutors had previously claimed.

 Zepeda moved to Japan to study at the University of Tsukuba in 2014 and started dating Kurosaki, according to reports. In September 2016, Kurosaki moved to Besançon, France, at the age of 21to study language as an exchange student at the University of Franche-Comte.

The couple reportedly broke up in the fall of that year but met again while having dinner with acquaintances on Dec. 4, 2016. The two went to Kurosaki’s dormitory after their meal, and some students claimed to have heard a scream from her room later that night. She has been missing ever since.

Zepeda went back to Chile shortly after Kurosaki’s disappearance. He was handed over to French authorities in July 2020 with the help of Chilean authorities.

French prosecutors formally charged Zepeda with murder, claiming that he committed the crime over a quarrel. The court has not disclosed the reasoning behind the ruling, according to reports.

Zepeda's trial began in March. French prosecutors reportedly argued for lifetime imprisonment, but Zepeda was only given a 28-year prison sentence.

French authorities launched a search for Kurosaki’s body after her disappearance, but police have yet to find her remains.

4/16/2022,"(Reuters) -Russia has confirmed the Moskva missile cruiser, the flagship of its Black Sea Fleet, has sunk while being towed to port following what it said was a fire and explosions involving ammunition stowed onboard. Ukraine says the Moskva's fate was sealed by a missile strike launched by its forces from the coast which ripped open the hulking Soviet-era ship's hull. Russia's defence ministry has not confirmed that version of events. Reuters is unable to verify either side's assertions. Here's what we do know, and what the sinking means (and does not mean) for Russia's battle-readiness: WHAT CAPABILITIES DOES THE SINKING DEPRIVE RUSSIA OF? Russia has powerful air defence systems deployed in Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, but the Moskva was able to provide long-range and mobile air defence protection for the entire Black Sea Fleet and was a floating command and control centre. Its loss degrades the fleet's air defences, particularly on longer range missions. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CREW? The ship had a crew of around 500 sailors who Russia said were successfully evacuated to other ships before being returned to their home port of Sevastopol in Crimea on Friday. Ukraine has suggested there are likely to have been fatalities, but Russia has not said anything on the subject yet. WILL IT LOSS CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE UKRAINE CONFLICT? Unlikely to, but Britain's Ministry of Defence says its loss is likely to prompt Russia to review its naval posture in the Black Sea. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that while the sinking would have a symbolic impact and potentially raise questions about Russia's longer-term naval capabilities, it would be unlikely to have a major impact on the course of the conflict. The Russian navy has so far not played a big role. One U.S. official said that Russia had only used its warships in a limited fashion, to carry out occasional strikes and resupply troops in the south. Russia retains naval dominance in the immediate region and the Moskva was equipped to destroy enemy vessels at sea but little is left of Ukraine's navy. WILL RUSSIA'S NAVY NOW CHANGE THE WAY IT OPERATES AND DOES THAT MATTER? Yes it will, but that change is not seen as being hugely significant. After the fire on the Moskva started, which U.S. officials believe was likely a Ukrainian attack, about five Russian warships in the northern part of the Black Sea moved further away from the coast, about 80 nautical miles. But U.S. officials said they believed those ships were still capable of carrying out strikes into Ukraine from that distance and were less likely to be targeted by the Ukrainians that far away from the coast. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank, said the Ukrainian military’s ability to hit Russian warships in the Black Sea could force the Russian Navy to deploy additional air defence and other assets for protection. WAS THE MOSKVA EARMARKED FOR A ROLE IN THE UNFOLDING CONFLICT? Not clear, but some analysts say it may have helped support a possible Russian amphibious landing in the Ukrainian port of Odesa that has not happened yet because of resistance from Ukrainian forces. Its sinking may be seen in some quarters in Ukraine as reducing the chances of such an assault and allow Ukraine to redeploy some of its forces elsewhere. CAN RUSSIA EASILY REPLACE THE MOSKVA'S CAPABILITIES No. Russia has two other ships of the same class, the Marshal Ustinov and the Varyag, which serve with Russia's Northern and Pacific fleets respectively. Turkey, which controls access to the Black Sea via the Bosphorus, will not let them enter at a time of war. WAS THE MOSKVA ARMED WITH UNIQUE WEAPONS? No. It had anti-ship missiles and surface-to-air missiles, but was not equipped with Russia's latest generation Kalibr cruise missiles or hypersonic missiles. HOW MODERN A SHIP WAS IT? Not very. Designed in the 1970s Soviet Union during the Cold War, it was conceived to destroy U.S. aircraft carriers and had been in service for nearly four decades. It underwent an extensive refit, and according to Britain's Ministry of Defence, only returned to operational status in 2021. Despite that refit, some of its hardware remained outdated. HOW BIG A BLOW TO RUSSIAN MILITARY PRIDE IS THE SINKING? It's a bitter loss for the Russian military as the ship, though ageing, was a symbol of the Crimea-based Black Sea Fleet and of Russian military pride. If it was holed by Ukrainian anti-ship missiles, it would be the biggest Russian warship to be lost in action since 1941, when German dive bombers crippled the Soviet battleship Marat in Kronshtadt harbour. The sinking, whether by Ukrainian missile strikes or through a mishap, “is a major propaganda victory for Ukraine,” said an assessment by the ISW. Western diplomats and experts expect senior officers in the Black Sea Fleet to lose their jobs over the sinking.

4/16/2022,"While Sunny Balwani’s legal team maintains that he was simply an investor in Theranos, newly revealed text messages cast his involvement with the infamous startup in a new light. During Balwani’s trial, a collection of private text messages were shown to jurors to help them gain insight into the nature of Balwani’s romantic relationship with Elizabeth Holmes and their business partnership. “I am responsible for everything at Theranos,” Balwani wrote in one text exchange to Holmes, as reported by NBC. “I worked six years day and night to help you…sad about where we are,” Balwani also texted Holmes, emphasizing his dedication to his work at Theranos, according to NBC. The relationship between Holmes—Theranos’ founder—and her ex-boyfriend Balwani—its former president and chief operating officer—is a talking point the lawyers have brought up repeatedly in both fraud cases. In the public eye, Holmes was in charge of Theranos, and in 2017, she even told the SEC that she was “the ultimate decision-maker” for the company. The former startup CEO was touted as the youngest self-made billionaire in 2015. Beyond being the face of the company, Holmes also represented Theranos at prestigious conferences like President Bill Clinton’s CGI (Clinton Global Initiative) meeting in 2015, a 2014 TEDMED Talk, and the Wall Street Journal’s WSJD Live 2015. While Balwani’s image wasn’t known to the public, his private influence was present in all areas of the company, according to the newly revealed text exchanges in which he admits to wielding a lot of power and takes responsibility for Theranos. This new information undermines the position of his legal defense, which maintains that he wasn’t in charge of the company. Balwani is currently on trial for his role in the company’s defrauding investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars. He is charged with 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He has pleaded not guilty to all 12 counts. Holmes has previously labeled Balwani as verbally and sexually abusive and even claimed that Balwani controlled what she ate and berated her, likening her leadership skills to a “monkey trying to fly a spaceship.” Holmes was found guilty on Jan. 4 of one count of conspiracy and three counts of wire fraud “in connection with a multimillion-dollar scheme to defraud investors in Theranos, Inc.,” according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Holmes is currently living in her $135 million Silicon Valley mansion awaiting her sentencing in September. She faces up to 80 years in prison. Holmes met Balwani in China when she was 18 and he was 37. After Holmes dropped out of Stanford University in 2004, she soon moved in with Balwani in 2005. Holmes is known her affinity for green juice after her former executive assistant at Theranos began creating popular TikTok videos in which she recalled her experiences working at the infamous blood testing company, such as being tasked to go to Whole Foods twice a day to pick up “incredibly fresh” green juice. The popularity of the limited Hulu series, The Dropout, which stars Amanda Seyfried as Holmes, has caused a resurgence of interest in the outcome of Balwani’s trial. In the series, Holmes’s relationship with Balwani—which is kept secret from their colleagues—is one of the most interesting dynamics in the show and has multiple dramatic scenes that are based in real life.

4/16/2022,"Somehow, the dumbbell front raise is commonly held to be an important exercise for shoulder workouts. The idea is to give your front delts some dedicated attention, so the exercise is often plugged into upper body splits. But once you look at your training from a functionality standpoint, the front raise has worn out its welcome. If you’re already doing plenty of presses for both chest, then adding this isolation move can be considered a bit of overkill on your anterior deltoids. That makes the exercise highly overrated, according to Men’s Health fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S., and Men’s Health Advisory Board member David Otey, C.S.C.S.. Even more than overrated, the front raise might do you more harm than good. The front raise actually incorporates the elbows, wrists, and hands to raise the load, and not in a way that's conducive to everyday, functional movements. When’s the last time you picked anything up with your arms fully extended? Worse, you put unnecessary stress on elbow joints with the front raise. “Even if you're thinking about building perfectly symmetrical shoulders, you're better off focusing on lateral raises, and rear delt raises,” Samuel says. “The front raise just isn't great bang for your buck.” So what to do instead? Try these shoulder suggestions instead. Although this exercise targets the lateral deltoid head, lateral raises are not a complete isolation exercise—they also incorporate surrounding muscles to help strengthen the entire shoulder. And when it comes to shoulder symmetry, the outer deltoid is more important. Shoot for three sets of three sets of 10 to 12 reps. Barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells—it doesn’t matter which you choose, any of press is more beneficial to your anterior delts than the front raise, according to Samuel and Otey. The primary function of the front delt is to press into an overhead position, and presses allow you to use a heavier load, which will help build up the front shoulder. When performed properly, presses allow your shoulders to work in a more natural way. Eight to 10 reps should be sufficient for this exercise. This bodyweight chest classic also hits the front delts in a safer way that will take some unnecessary stress off the shoulders. Try for three sets of as many reps as possible. “When it comes to symmetry, shoulders don't really happen unless your chest is there,” Samuel says. “So come off of the front raise. It's not worth it.” You Might Also Like This Workout Torches Fat in Under 10 Minutes How to Cool Down After Your Hardest Workouts What’s the Deal With Intermittent Fasting for Weight Loss?",Health/Men's Health,Stop Blasting Your Shoulders With Front Raises.

4/16/2022,"NEW YORK — A trillion dollars: That’s how much money famed investor Bill Browder believes Vladimir Putin and Russian oligarchs have stolen from the Russian people since the fall of the Soviet Union. “And that was money that was supposed to be spent on health care and education, roads and services,” Browder said at a Manhattan event to celebrate the publication of his second book, “Freezing Order,” which chronicles how he became a Putin nemesis as a result of his attempts to expose Kremlin corruption. Those efforts led to the death of Browder’s attorney Sergei Magnitsky, who was tortured in a Russian prison and whose name is affixed to sanctions bills passed by Congress. Learning of Magnitsky’s death was “the most heartbreaking, traumatic, and devastating moment of my life,” Browder writes — and a sign of how committed Putin was willing to pursuing perceived enemies of the state. The grandson of American communist leader Earl Browder, Bill Browder had made billions through Hermitage Capital Management, the fund he started in 1996, during the chaotic period of full-contact Russian capitalism. As Browder heightened scrutiny of some of the companies he invested in — most notably, energy giant Gazprom — he ran afoul of a Kremlin that, under Putin, has declared such questions off limits, as they would go to the very heart of the kleptocracy that had ruled Russia since the nation’s industry was sold off and plundered in the early 1990s. “Everyone tries to think about Russia as a sovereign state and Putin as a leader acting in national interest,” Browder said to Yahoo News, describing that outlook as a fundamental misunderstanding. “You think you can apply political science to Russia. You need to apply criminal science. You need to be a criminologist to understand Russia. People don’t go into government to serve the country. They go into government to steal money.” Browder was banned from entering Russia in 2005 and has since watched a series of American presidents try to improve relations with the Kremlin. He now lives in London, a city favored by the oligarchs he despises. “We basically said, ‘It's OK. We want your money. We want your oil,’” Browder told Yahoo News in an interview at the Century Club ahead of Tuesday’s book release party. Today it is uncontroversial to call Putin a war criminal. But the man bombing Kharkiv is the same one who leveled the Chechen capital, Grozny, in 2000, invaded Georgia in 2008 and seized Ukrainian territory for the first time in 2014. “When I walked into the offices of government ministers in Europe, or the United States, back in the early days talking about sanctioning Russia — it’s like I walked in with a giant turd on my head,” Browder said. Today, Browder is known less as an investor than as a human rights campaigner and Putin critic. Tuesday’s party thus included an eclectic mix: the professional basketball player Enes Kanter Freedom, former federal prosecutor Preet Bharara, private equity giant Stephen Schwarzman and National Review journalist Jay Nordlinger, who in 2017 highlighted the refusal of federal authorities to allow Browder into the U.S. The decision was reversed. Browder is especially withering when it comes to the Western attorneys, bankers and publicists who help Putin’s oligarchs hide their ill-gotten gains, sue investigative journalists into submission and burnish their blood-spattered records with favorable coverage. There could be only one motive for Western firms to do business with the Kremlin, Browder believes. “They’re just a bunch of greedy bastards that are trying to make as much money as possible,” he said, alluding to the legal travails of British journalist Catherine Belton, who was sued for reporting on Kremlin corruption. “They don’t care who they’re working for.” Last week, Browder testified in Washington during a hearing on the Enablers Act, which would tighten already existing rules around money laundering, in effect providing more government scrutiny into the secretive movement of funds from countries like China and Russia. “If we make banks report dirty money but allow law, real estate and accounting firms to look the other way, that creates a loophole that crooks and kleptocrats can sail a yacht through,” Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., said last fall when introducing the legislation. While it targets any institution or individual abetting money laundering, the measure has assumed a new urgency since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Browder has additionally called for foreign accomplices of Russia to be deprived of entry into the United States, a proposal clearly aimed at Kremlin allies residing in the British capital, which has earned the unflattering nickname “Londongrad.” He bemoans the notion that high-profile seizures of oligarchs’ yachts give the impression of fatal blows, when they are really just minor difficulties or men worth billions. “The real money is held in highly complex trusts and structures,” Browder said, in offshore havens like Jersey and the Cayman Islands. Sanctions are one way to fight Putin. Weapons are another. “The Ukrainians say they need a no fly-zone,” he pointed out, rejecting the idea that such a move would immediately lead to nuclear war. “At what point,” he wondered, “do you finally stand up to Russia?” And much as he would like to see Putin defeated, he hopes to return to Russia one day when it is a free country, one that doesn’t threaten him with prison or murder. “It’s fascinating. It’s interesting. It’s unforgettable. It’s horrible,” Browder told Yahoo News. “It’s nasty, brutish. It’s got everything. If Putin wasn’t in power, and there was a democratic government, I would love to go back there.”",World/Yahoo News,Putin nemesis Bill Browder reveals the 'real money' funding Kremlin's war,https://news.yahoo.com/putin-nemesis-bill-browder-reveals-the-real-money-funding-kremlins-war-090014724.html

4/16/2022,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — The Nevada Supreme Court has upheld a jury’s findings that illusionist David Copperfield and the MGM Grand hotel-casino were not financially responsible for a British tourist’s injuries during a signature vanishing act at a Las Vegas Strip show in 2013. Gavin Cox and his wife, Minh-Hahn Cox, alleged that the multimillionaire magician, the hotel, two Copperfield business entities and a construction firm that was renovating the hotel caused permanent brain injuries for Cox when he fell while taking part in the trick as a randomly picked audience member. In a complex verdict reached in May 2018 after several weeks of testimony, the jury found Copperfield, the hotel and Copperfield’s company, Backstage Disappearing Inc., negligent but not civilly liable for Cox’s fall. Cox had sought hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical costs and damages, but jurors found him responsible for his own injuries and he received no money. Brian Harris, attorney for the couple, noted Friday that the court split 5-2 on its ruling, issued Thursday. “Had the dissenting opinion been shared by the majority, our clients would be looking at a new trial,” Harris said. “We are disappointed we won’t have that opportunity.” Five justices rejected Harris' argument that the trial judge should not have allowed attorneys for the hotel to show jurors surveillance videos of Cox walking with apparent ease to court with his dog on a leash. In the courtroom, jurors saw Cox helped to the witness stand by his attorney or court officers. He testified that he needed assistance when not in court. Copperfield’s illusion, dubbed “the runaround” by stagehands, appeared to make as many as 13 audience volunteers disappear onstage and reappear moments later in the back of the theater. The jury heard that in less than 90 seconds, stagehands with flashlights ushered the audience members offstage through dark curtains, down passageways, outdoors and then indoors through a kitchen to re-enter the theater for the show’s finale.

4/16/2022,"A Buddhist monk in Thailand drew criticism after local villagers found him drunkenly passed out and exposed in the local temple.

The 50-year-old monk, an unnamed former policeman, was found lying down on the balcony of a Buddhist temple in the Thai province of Nakhon Ratchasima on Tuesday afternoon.

Villagers found the monk fully exposed and surrounded by energy drinks and a bottle of Thai rice whisky with 40% alcohol content in his room.

They eventually brought his elderly mother to the temple to wake him up. After being scolded by his mother, the monk got in a pickup truck and drove away.

The monk, who reportedly had gotten drunk while celebrating the Thai New Year, found nothing wrong with the incident. While he admitted to getting intoxicated, he does not consider alcohol a problem and argued that he didn’t cause harm to others while under the influence.

Among the 227 rules that Buddhist monks in Thailand must follow, however, is the requirement that they cease drinking alcohol or becoming intoxicated by any means. Monks in Thailand are also not allowed to hold a driver’s license.

He has been ordained as a monk for four years now but has reportedly displayed similar behavior in the past, according to the villagers.

Elders in the village previously advised the monk to abandon his monkhood. They reportedly gathered evidence in the form of photos and videos of the most recent incident in an effort to request his monkhood be revoked.

While the number has not been independently verified, last month a Nato source put the numbers of Russian soldiers killed at between 7,000 and 15,000.

Morale is said to be dropping amongst Russian troops, and Western officials claimed last month that an army commander was killed by a group of demoralised soldiers fed up with the scale of losses during the invasion of Ukraine. The commander of the 37th rifle brigade, named by officials as Colonel Medvechek, is understood to have been run over by one of his own soldiers who had grown frustrated by his unit's heavy losses. Russia is believed to be sending top leaders to the frontlines in a bid to bolster low morale among troops. Putin had reportedly hoped to take over Ukraine in a matter of days, but now seven weeks into the conflict troops have retreated from areas in the north to focus on renewed assault on cities in the south of the country.

The ministry said its forces had also taken full control of the Ilyich Steel Plant in the besieged port city of Mariupol, which has been encircled by Russian troops for weeks. Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on Friday which appeared to be among the most significant there since Russian troops pulled back from the area earlier this month in preparation for battles in the south and east. The explosions were reported to have been heard after the Russian defence ministry announced that the Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, had sunk while being towed after being badly damaged. Ukraine claimed the Moskva's damage was the result of one of its missile strikes. Russia's defence ministry spoke only of a fire breaking out and of exploding ammunition. The defence ministry said in its statement that its overnight missile strikes on Kyiv had struck the 'Vizar' factory on the edge of the Ukrainian capital which it said made and repaired missiles, including anti-ship missiles. It pledged more strikes on Kyiv.

4/16/2022,"Seniors at two high schools in Alabama swapped schools for a day as a prank and were suspended by their administrators — a punishment they now say is too harsh , according to local media reports. More than a dozen seniors from Chilton County High School, in Clanton, and Jemison High School, in Jemison, attended classes at the opposite school’s campus on Monday, April 11, according to Al.com. The schools are located about 15 miles from one another, about 50 miles south of Birmingham.

 The students managed to attend half a day’s worth of classes before they were found out by school officials, according to AL.com. The prank, which students planned on Snapchat, resulted in three-day suspensions for multiple seniors, according to WVTM.

 “My scholarships are in jeopardy because of this,” Jemison High School senior Haileigh Greer told WBRC. She also told the outlet that she had been kicked off the school softball team. “I don’t mind the three day suspension. I understand,” Greer told WBRC. “But we shouldn’t have got kicked off the teams. I mean I have played softball since I was 8 and I got kicked off my senior year.” Neither the Chilton County Schools Board of Education nor the superintendent responded to a request for comment from McClatchy News. In a statement sent to WVTM13, superintendent Jason Griffin said “Chilton County schools follows law, policy and procedure in all aspects of day to day operations.” According to AL.com, Chilton County’s code of conduct largely leaves punishment decisions up to administrators, with pranks usually considered minor infractions but going to other campuses without permission being more serious.

Interfax said all the crew had been evacuated. It cited the ministry as blaming the blast on a fire and said the cause was being investigated. A Ukrainian official earlier said the Moskva had been hit by two anti-ship missiles but did not give any evidence. The 12,500 tonne ship usually has a crew of around 500. ""As the result of a fire on the Moskva missile cruiser, ammunition detonated. The ship was seriously damaged,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement. ""The crew was completely evacuated."" Russian news agencies said the Moskva, commissioned in 1983, was armed with 16 anti-ship ""Vulkan"" cruise missiles with a range of at least 700 km (440 miles). Interfax did not give more details of the incident. In April 2021, the agency quoted a retired Russian admiral as saying ""this is the most serious ship in the Black Sea"". Kyiv says the Moskva featured in one of the landmark early exchanges of the war, when Ukrainian border guards on Snake Island, a small outcrop in the Black Sea, told the ship to ""go fuck yourself"" after it demanded they surrender. Although Ukrainian officials initially said all 13 guards had died in the subsequent Russian attack, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy later said some of them survived. Maksym Marchenko, governor of the region around the Black Sea port of Odesa, earlier said the Moskva had been hit by two Ukrainian-made Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles, but did not provide evidence. ""It has been confirmed that the missile cruiser Moskva today went exactly where the border guards on Snake Island told it to go,"" he said in an online post. Ukraine's defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Last month Ukraine said it had destroyed a large Russian landing support ship, the Orsk, on the smaller Sea of Azov to the northeast of the Black Sea. Moscow has not commented on what had happened to the ship.
