4/18/2022,"Russia's war on Ukraine has shown what air warfare over a modern battlefield looks like. Neither side has the F-35, but it is designed for this environment, former test pilot Billie Flynn said. F-35s have ""capabilities precisely focused on what we have been seeing in Ukraine,"" Flynn said. As the war in Ukraine approaches its third month, neither Russia nor Ukraine have been able to dominate the air, as both still have operational surface-to-air missile batteries and aircraft. This makes the war in Ukraine unique among recent conflicts, and it provides useful lessons about how modern airframes would operate in contested airspace. In an interview with The Aviationist on April 7, Billie Flynn, a former Canadian lieutenant colonel and senior F-35 test pilot for Lockheed Martin, highlighted the role that the F-35 could play in similar conditions. ""The F-35 was designed precisely for an environment that we are seeing in Ukraine now,"" Flynn said. The F-35, built by Lockheed Martin, is one of two fifth-generation fighter jets used by the US, alongside the F-22 Raptor, and one of four in use around the world. China's J-20 entered mass production in late 2021 and hasn't seen combat. Russia's Su-57 hasn't entered mass production and has only deployed in a few limited missions in Syria. A multirole stealth aircraft, the F-35 is intended for air-superiority and strike missions. It is equipped with a powerful electronic-warfare and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance suite. Those capabilities, which allow the F-35 to gather and distribute real-time battlefield information to friendly forces, have earned it the nickname ""the quarterback of the skies."" The weaponry it carries varies. In a configuration known as ""beast mode"" it carries four 500-pound GBU-12 laser-guided bombs on its wings, two GBU-12 in its internal weapons bay, and an AIM-9 air-to-air heat-seeking missile. That configuration sacrifices stealth for firepower. When in stealth mode, the jet foregoes externally mounted weapons to preserve its low-observable profile. There are three variants of the F-35. The F-35A is designed for conventional takeoffs and landings, the F-35B for short takeoffs and vertical landings, and the F-35C for aircraft-carrier operations. In a contested airspace, the survivability of older fourth-generation fighter aircraft, like the ubiquitous F-16, will be limited, Flynn told The Aviationist. F-16s are ""not survivable in the very highly contested world,"" like in Ukraine, where there are ""significant numbers of sophisticated surface-to-air threats,"" Flynn said. However, the F-35's ability to enhance the capabilities of friendly aircraft is exactly what would make it invaluable in a similar conflict, Flynn said. ""The F-35 was designed to operate in highly contested airspace, with capabilities precisely focused on what we have been seeing in Ukraine today. If you have F-35s, you do not necessarily need F-16s to do the damage that the F-35 would bring,"" according to the former F-35 test pilot. The F-35 would be particularly effective against surface-to-air missile systems and other ground defenses, neutralizing them and enemy aircraft to achieve air dominance. The aircraft's stealth profile will be one of its main advantages in doing so. ""Remember,"" Flynn said, ""we see them, they don't see us. It's like playing football, when one team's invisible and the other team is not with a gross advantage on behalf of the F-35. F-35 would see all the enemy air-to-air threats and kill them all, plus completely neutralizing the surface-to-air missile threat to achieve air dominance."" Once air dominance is achieved, aircraft like the F-16 can provide additional firepower against enemy ground forces, but even then the F-35 will be needed to protect them, according to Flynn. The F-35 could also conduct close-air-support missions for troops on the ground. When friendly ground troops are in close contact with the enemy, however, the F-35 may have to use its less advanced armaments and accept more risk to do so. ""There may be a time when the troops are in contact and you're going to come down and use the gun in the F-35,"" Flynn said. ""That's a lot of risk for an $80 million F-35, but our job is to protect the troops on the ground."" The US has repeatedly said that it will not become a combatant in Ukraine. F-35s have been flying missions in stealth mode near Ukraine's borders, though it's not clear if they were conducting regular patrols to deter Russia or using their electronic capabilities to monitor forces in and around Ukraine. Nevertheless, their presence so close to the conflict zone has had an impact, according to Flynn. Having that jet flying along NATO's eastern flank ""is a significant deterrent"" against Russian forces ""continuing their ambitions to push further eastward. Because the F-35 represent an extraordinary lethal threat,"" Flynn said. The F-35's ""capacity to neutralize the enemy cannot be matched by any other airplane that flies in anybody else's air force,"" Flynn said. ""So just the fact that the F-35s are there scares everybody on the other side."" Constantine Atlamazoglou works on transatlantic and European security.

4/18/2022,"When the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, the Moskva, was badly damaged earlier this week, Ukraine immediately claimed that it had struck it with two missiles, and Russia denied it, instead blaming the damage on a fire where ammunition on the ship was stored. While the Moskva was being towed to port, it sank, after it became unstable in stormy conditions because of the damage to the hull, the Russian Defense Ministry told the Russian state news service Tass. On Friday, a senior U.S. defense official confirmed that the Russian cruiser had been struck by two Neptune anti-ship missiles fired by the Ukrainians from land-based launchers. The Ukrainian-made Neptunes may also be launched from ship or air. The U.S. military's worldwide equipment guide describes the Neptune as an anti-ship cruise missile with a maximum firing range of 280 kilometers, or about 174 miles. The Russian ship, about 600 feet long, was about 60 kilometers or about 37 miles south of Odesa, which is well within the range of the Neptune, a separate defense official said. According to the second official, the ship generally has almost 500 sailors onboard. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told CNN Thursday that some crew members were evacuated. ""I don't know how many they got off. We did see indications that there were life boats and that some sailors got off the ship,"" he said. It's not known how many casualties there were. The Neptune has been in service in the Ukrainian Navy since March 2021, according to the U.S. Army. Military-today.com, a site that tracks military equipment, describes the Neptune as the Ukrainian version of a Russian Kh-35 anti-ship cruise missile, differing in that it is longer and has more fuel and a larger booster. The site says that it was developed by Luch Design Bureau, a Ukrainian defense contractor. Luch Design Bureau's description of the Neptune says, ""It is intended to defeat warships such as cruiser, destroyer frigate, corvette, airborne, tank landing ships and vehicles.""

4/18/2022,"BELGRADE (Reuters) - Thousands of Serbs waving Russian and Serbian flags and carrying pictures of President Vladimir Putin marched through Belgrade to the Russian embassy on Friday, to protest Serbia's government bid to distance itself from Moscow after its invasion of Ukraine. Throngs of people, many from ultranationalist organizations, joined the march from the city center to the nearby Russian embassy, where they fired signal flares, played Russian and Serbian anthems and hailed the two countries as brotherly nations. ""I came to this rally to support Russia and to say a loud and clear 'no' to policies of authorities in Belgrade who made a shameful decision to vote against Russia in the U.N.,"" said Mladen Obradovic, a protester. In recent weeks Belgrade voted three times for United Nations' resolutions that condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and suspended it from the main U.N. human rights body. Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation."" Still, Serbia, which is almost entirely dependent on Russian gas and oil, refuses to impose sanctions against the Kremlin and it maintains regular flights to Moscow. Protesters chanted ""No NATO"" and ""Serbians and Russians are brothers,"" and slogans against President Aleksandar Vucic who won the presidential vote on April 3, while his Progressives secured the most votes to form a government. Earlier this week, in a move seen by experts as a departure from military cooperation with Russia, Vucic said Serbia was eyeing a purchase of two dozen new and used Western jet fighters.
