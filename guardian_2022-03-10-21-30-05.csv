Jose I think he was surprised I was in a wheelchair, and that I wasn’t white. He’s married to a Japanese woman so, you know, he’s not racist … He’s open to other cultures and ways of life. Olly I had some pasta stuff – Italian obviously. And a fishcake as well … it wasn’t a fishcake, something vegan. It was a nice meal, cheers for that. Jose I had scallops with pea puree and parsnips, then lamb cutlets with dauphinoise potatoes, then a sticky toffee pudding with white chocolate ice-cream. It was delicious. Olly I wasn’t too fussed about Brexit. That free-market stuff is all about money and infinite growth, all that nonsense. The people who benefit from immigration in the current political system are the people who benefit from cheap labour – that’s what I worry about. But at the same time, I’m an anarchist so I’m not going to say stop them coming. Just to be clear, I am quite fond of lederhosen and waffles, a bit of yodelling, love all that stuff. Jose I cried when Brexit came through. I believe in open borders. I believe in immigration. Also I feel European. Brexit hasn’t worked, everything is going downhill. Olly It’s not just the EU. It’s political systems I’m suspicious of, including Brussels and Whitehall. I reject those systems. Jose I’m interested in politics.

Jose Statues of people connected to the slave trade should be pulled down, because of what they represent. Olly Why stop at racism and slavery? Coming to it as an artist, there’s a lot of public art I’d like to see torn down – like that terrible statue of lovers embracing in the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras in London. That’s the first to go. It’s like when your grandmother goes to an art fair in the village hall, brings back a terrible painting of a sad-looking clown and sticks it on the wall.

Jose I think he’s an anti-vaxxer. Olly I’m not vaccinated. I feel these vaccines are too new. I’d rather think about it for a few years. Every time I see people on TV saying “get vaccinated”, it seems like: “You peasant, get vaccinated, get back to work, for the minimum wage, and have unattainable dreams.” Jose I did mention that he was a carer, but he said his dad was vaccinated so he thought it was all right. Olly We were talking for a long time. It was a cool conversation. We weren’t polar opposites. Jose It was a good experience.

3/10/2022,"The Japanese retailer Uniqlo is the latest international brand to suspend operations in Russia in a U-turn after pressure to take action over the war in Ukraine. Earlier this week Fast Retailing, the clothing chain’s owner, said it intended to keep its Russian shops open because clothing was a “necessity of life”, even as a string of brands from McDonald’s and Starbucks to Burberry and Asos suspended operations in the country. On Thursday, Fast Retailing issued a statement saying it was suspending its operations as it had “recently faced a number of difficulties, including operational challenges and the worsening of the conflict situation”. The company said it still believed making “everyday clothing available to the general public in Russia” was part of its mission but it had become clear it could no longer continue to do so because of the difficulties involved. “Our thoughts are with the people who are suffering today, and we will do whatever we can to support them during these very tragic times. We wish for the return of peace and stability as quickly as possible,” the company said. Fast Retailing previously announced a donation of $10m to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, to help people fleeing Ukraine. It also said employees in Europe had been helping deliver clothing to refugees. A host of international brands have suspended operations in Russia amid financial sanctions and public pressure in western countries to support Ukraine. Starbucks, Coca-Cola, Pepsi joined McDonald’s in pausing operations on Tuesday, as well as Netflix, Levi’s, Burberry and Ikea. The owner of KFC and Pizza Hut said it was suspending 70 KFC company-owned restaurants in Russia and finalising an agreement to suspend all 50 Pizza Hut outlets in partnership with its master franchisee. On Wednesday, Mothercare, Heineken, the UK tobacco firm Imperial Brands and Universal Music Group also joined the exodus. Unilever, the owner of Marmite and Ben & Jerry’s, said it had suspended imports and exports to Russia but continued to supply essential food and hygiene products made in the country to locals.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Uniqlo suspends operations in Russia in unexpected U-turn,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/10/uniqlo-suspends-operations-russia-u-turn-fashion
3/10/2022,"The default tone of The Adam Project, Free Guy director Shawn Levy’s second sci-fi lite offering with Ryan Reynolds in as many years, is apiece with any other Reynolds film: quippy one-liners leavening a stressful situation. “Time travel exists, you just don’t know it yet,” we’re told in the opening shot, as an adult Adam Reed, another Reynolds-standard – a generically handsome, witty nice guy – steals a plane in the year 2050. Spitting comebacks even as he’s under fire in space – the graphics here (invisible ships!) seem decent for Netflix but still best suited for a small screen – Adam opens up a wormhole and crash-lands somewhere outside of Seattle in 2022. Adult Adam, wounded and four years off from his target (the year 2018, to be later explained), blows up the life of his 12-year-old self (Walker Scobell), an asthmatic, caustic small fry reeling from the recent loss of his scientist father Louis (Mark Ruffalo). Scobell, with his reedy voice, soft brown eyes and flop of blonde hair, is endearing despite having to muddle through lines that feel generated from a Reynolds bot – chirpy, deeply annoying comebacks to his wearied mother Ellie (an underused Jennifer Garner) or a pair of archetypical school bullies. Little Adam is an aerospace nerd with a strong grasp of Back to the Future references, which is the best way to view this film: a high-concept but thin homage to light-hearted sci-fi romps of the past. Packaged with a prestige Netflix film budget (and filmed on location in Vancouver), The Adam Project offers a buffet of family friendly hooks – slickly choreographed action sequences with invisible fighters of the future, booming score, the baseline emotional pull that is the passage of time – that make little sense if you think at all about it, which is not really the point. It’s spectacle coasting on the evergreen draw of time travel paced with beats of occasionally effective human emotion – grief, regret, self-loathing and acceptance in sometimes moving, very manageable amounts. The script by Jonathan Tropper, Mark Levin, Jennifer Flackett and TS Nowlin attempts the necessary explanations of 1) how time travel is possible and, more pressingly, 2) what happens when past and future self meet, which isn’t well explained beyond “the prevailing wisdom is: not good,” though that’s ultimately not necessary to appreciate a caper such as this. The Adams –12-year-old Adam in his “fixed time” (one’s natural untampered timeline, so 2022) and 40-year-old Adam from 2050 – are tasked with finding Adam’s future/current wife Laura (Zoe Saldana), who was possibly sabotaged into a 2018 trap (this all gets mind-bendy very fast, better to turn brain onto cruise control). The mission quickly morphs to saving the future from the time-travel exploitation of Louis’s former patron, of-the-moment villainess tech CEO Maya Sorian (Catherine Keener), shot through with several time travel ethics questions used more as props than guideposts. Enjoyment of The Adam Project will depend heavily on one’s tolerance for Reynolds’ well-established schtick, seeing as its doubled here into two schticks bouncing off each other. As in, nerdy Adam marvels at buff adult Adam’s muscles and is massively relieved that he one day gets laid. If the lilt of a tamer Deadpool or, of course, Free Guy are your thing, then The Adam Project will be more of your wheelhouse. What does work, for me at least, are the sappy yet effective depictions of loss and the basic human ache for a little bit more control over the relentless march forward. Who hasn’t wished at some point to go back in time and savor a simple moment again, tell someone you loved them one more time, cheat death for an hour or two? The Adam Project benefits from the presence of Garner, always good as a mom with a deep well of compassion, and Ruffalo – no stranger to blockbuster action humor as the Avengers’ Hulk – who elevates the role of the Adams’ workaholic father. At just under two hours, The Adam Project is stuffed with cheerfully indecipherable plot twists (nuclear reactors, crystals, equations) and mind scramblers (older characters manipulating their younger selves, variations of the butterfly effect). But it’s all at a competent, polished remove – complicated enough to get invested if you want, but built for passive enjoyment. The Adam Project may gesture at the grand world of time travel physics, but it’s actually quite a simple formula.

3/10/2022,"It takes exactly 31 seconds from the start of his third album for Alex O’Connor to inform listeners that he’s feeling both stressed and “so depressed”. Those familiar with O’Connor’s oeuvre as Rex Orange County might suggest that’s very much par for the course. Feeling stressed and depressed is O’Connor’s thing. He’s stressed and depressed about girls, about his friendships, about his burgeoning musical career and, on a song called 7am, about forgetting to shut the blinds before he went to bed. He even has a weird habit of sounding upset when he’s ostensibly hymning a blossoming new romance, striking an oddly pleading tone: “I can’t believe you’ve come and saved me.” Even by the standards of sensitive “sad boi” singer-songwriters – none of them exactly big on impenetrable imagery and extended metaphors – O’Connor writes about his feelings in a curiously direct and unadorned way. Set to simple piano accompaniments that are often noticeably perkier than their subject matter, his lyrics frequently resemble too-much-information social media posts arranged into rhyming couplets and verses. (“So you want to be happy too? / What are you supposed to do?” he sings on Who Cares?’s title track.) In his back catalogue lurks a song about feeling stressed out called Stressed Out. He also has a song about feeling timid called Never Had the Balls and a song about being sad called A Song About Being Sad. By contrast, Ed Sheeran looks like Mark E Smith. This, one suspects, is the secret of Rex Orange County’s considerable success: his back catalogue is thick with singles that have gone gold or platinum without actually making the charts, a discombobulating phenomenon that indicates an awful lot of streams spread over a long period of time. As has been established thoroughly in recent years, what a lot of teen and tween listeners now want from pop is relatability, and they come no more relatable than O’Connor with his boy-next-door image, his unvarnished diary-entry lyrics and his frequent suggestions that stardom is all a bit much and he’d be happier living a more normal life: “I’m not cut out for this and I keep wanting to call it quits,” he sings on 7am. If you want an indication of the age group his music attracts, he’s about to release an expanded “anniversary” edition of his album Apricot Princess, celebrating not its 20th birthday, or even its 10th, but its fifth. Snort if you want at the idea of mistily recalling the halcyon era of 2017, but for a sizable chunk of his audience, five years ago probably does seem like the distant past – a time when the older ones were still studying for their GCSEs and the younger ones were still at primary school – and a simpler one at that. Musically, there’s a hint of vintage soul music about his approach on Who Cares?: the squelchy synth bass on Open a Window could have stepped off an early 80s R&B hit. There is in the construction of Shoot Me Down a barely perceptible hint of Oasis in ballad mode, specifically Stop Crying Your Heart Out. But with his tasteful string arrangements, his electric piano and his mid-Atlantic accent – “I’m alone witchoo,” he cries, as people from Hampshire villages so often do – what O’Connor really recalls is the poppier end of 70s soft rock: Andrew Gold, Leo Sayer, Dean Friedman. For all the 2020s sheen, the samples and the guest appearance from Tyler, the Creator (O’Connor guested on his album Flower Boy in the halcyon era of 2017), it doesn’t take a huge leap of imagination to picture him singing most of Who Cares? on Top of the Pops, perched at a keyboard in a cheesecloth shirt, before an audience waiting patiently for Showaddywaddy to come on and liven things up. Like his soft-rock forebears, at his best O’Connor seems to be part of a lineage of pop craftsmen for whom melody trumps everything – you don’t need edge, experimentation or lyrical fireworks if you can come up with a tune as strong as Open the Window or as cute as Making Time. But at his worst, it sounds limp and insubstantial, compounded by the thin production (a sonic link to the days when O’Connor was uploading his bedroom-recorded songs to Soundcloud) and his voice, which can tend to the nasal and whiny. The effect is often oddly flattening: “I kept opening my door just to see if you would walk through,” he sings on The Shade, sounding less like a man temporarily rendered irrational by love than someone waiting for a Deliveroo. It’s music so redolent of the current appetite for safe pop, and of a specific audience, that you wonder what the future holds for O’Connor. Perhaps he’ll grow and develop alongside his fans. Perhaps he’ll come good on one of his many threats to pack it all in. Right now, though, he’s engaged in giving people exactly what they want. If success really makes him as unhappy as he keeps claiming it does, he’s clearly going to be stressed and depressed for the foreseeable future: more unvarnished grist to the songwriting mill.

3/10/2022,"The last thing I’d ever want to do is lecture my “elders and betters” (as my grandmother called the older generation) about their behaviour. We oldies already know how to stay happy and healthy. We’ve had our jabs, we take our exercise, we’ve given up smoking and we eat our greens. So we don’t need any young whippersnapper – or worse, elderly TV presenter – to tell us what to do. But I have learned an important lesson in the two years since Covid hit, and I thought maybe others could benefit from it too. It’s about the internet. My generation is very wary of the internet – a view I understand and, to an extent, share. Every day there are new warnings about the dangers of cyberspace: the scams and the swindlers targeting older people. Callers to the Silver Line helpline, which I founded a decade ago as a resource for older people, often say that trying to navigate this jungle with a mouse, a keyboard and a mystifying screen is a challenge that has defeated them. In a 2019 Office for National Statistics survey, less than half of over-75s said that they had recently used the internet. That wouldn’t be such a problem, except that so many things are now migrating online – and technology’s triumphant march is leaving an awful lot of older people very isolated. Take shopping. My grandmother enjoyed pottering around the high street, exchanging gossip with shopkeepers who would greet her by name, ask after her family, and recognise and value her. Now, my high street is a tangle of charity shops and a few remaining chainstores and supermarkets. The human face has been replaced by a click on a screen. Even before the pandemic, Age UK found that in England, 1.4 million older people often felt lonely. It’s not easy to admit, because loneliness carries a stigma. The word we hear most often from callers to the Silver Line helpline is the “b” word – “burden”. One wrote anonymously to me that since she lost her husband of 54 years, she sometimes goes “for three days at a time without talking to anyone. I am an optimist by nature and sometimes I need that to get through another pointless day when I feel as if I am a waste of space.” No wonder loneliness causes serious damage to mental and physical health. I do not believe that there is a magic bullet to combat loneliness. But having seen how technology was cutting off older people, I learned to my surprise during lockdown that it could also offer a solution. When we were unable to meet face to face, it brought my family and friends into my home. We couldn’t travel, or hug, but still every day we could laugh, chat and send each other pictures. Work continued – I attended weekly meetings via FaceTime and Skype. If only Boris Johnson had realised, as I did, that he could use Zoom to hold parties. It’s convenient, easy, and I still do it. Even though I live deep in a forest, I still feel connected with the outside world, and the skills I learned during lockdown continue to prove their value to me day by day. The key is getting started. The University of the Third Age, U3A, conducted tutorials during lockdown to encourage members to use the internet, to upskill them and to have fun. In one session, 80 ukulele-playing U3A members joined in a virtual jam session. When Covid first drove me out of London into the wild beauty of the New Forest, I had only a very fragile three kilometres of copper wire linking my laptop with the outside world, so Zoom and Teams conferences and streaming video were impossible. I became only too aware how crucial high-quality broadband is. Even when, after six months, this did reach our village, I still had to learn how to actually use Zoom and Skype, but once you invent memorable passwords (and learn how to reinvent them when, as inevitably happens, they become unmemorable) they become your best friends. The good news I have discovered from the last 18 months of Zooming is that you only have to look respectable down to the waist, so you can spend the day in comfy slippers. And shopping online turns every day into Christmas as parcels arrive you have no memory of ordering but turn out to be exactly what you wanted, at least some of the time. And if you occasionally forget to unmute yourself, doesn’t everyone? It’s up to us oldies to take the first step. If any of us feel excluded or confused by technology, we must swallow our pride and ask for help. We need to encourage our friends, families, charities and volunteers to guide and mentor us into the brave new world. I suspect it will be far easier than we fear: if we can type, we can use a computer. And it’s worth it. A review of the literature on the impact of the internet on older people found lots of evidence for “the positive effect of computer use on the psychological functioning and wellbeing of the older adults”, and that internet use “has also been associated with decreased loneliness and depression, better social connectedness, self-esteem and cognitive functioning, improved self-efficacy, self-control, self-determination, social interaction, education and skills development”. Yes, there are new dangers, but any adventure has its risks. I would remind any reluctant fellow oldies that the invention of the car meant learning to drive, memorising the Highway Code, and fastening our seatbelts in order to stay safe. The same applies to navigating the internet: it’s a challenge at first, but it’s worth it. Like the car, the internet enables us to explore the world, to join our friends and loved ones, to celebrate together. And if at first the computer defeats us, it’s a wonderful excuse to ring up our grandchildren and ask them for help.

3/10/2022,"For a couple of years after those golden arches first appeared in Moscow on 31 January 1990, McDonald’s was a really big deal in Russia. It was more than a food experience. It was an exotic destination of devout pilgrimage. In 1992, I was living in St Petersburg for the summer to study Russian. I had travelled to Moscow on the overnight train with a group of Russian friends. The first thing I wanted to do – being in Moscow for the first time in my life – was to see Red Square as the sun came up. My friends had other ideas about the most important port of call. We had to go straight to McDonald’s and get a Beeg Mak or – just as exciting – a gamburger. (Actual Russian word.) There was no point in standing in their way. The Kremlin would have to wait. This week, McDonald’s announced that it would be suspending its operations in Russia. This affects 847 branches and 62,000 employees, who will continue to be paid. The company’s president and CEO Chris Kempczinski said: “Our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine.” The response echoes the actions of dozens of brands from Chanel and Burberry to Apple and Starbucks. Once upon a time three decades ago, the arrival of McDonald’s in Moscow represented the end of the cold war and the triumph of the joys of capitalism. On that first day in 1990, that first branch on Pushkinskaya Square expected to serve around 1,000 customers. But even before opening time, a line of 5,000 Russians was snaking round the block. As Russian customers explained to the western media covering the event, the queue was not a big deal. Queueing was something they were very used to. Customers marvelled at the size of the milkshakes. Some kept Big Mac boxes and other packaging to re-use at home because it was such a precious novelty. Others shook their heads at the outrageous prices. At 3 roubles and 75 kopecks, a Big Mac was the equivalent of half a day’s wages, costing the equivalent of $6.25 at the time – the most expensive McDonald’s in the world. It is hard to overstate the frenzy around consumer experiences in the very early post-Soviet days. By the time that Mikhail Gorbachev left office in 1991, western brands such as Dunkin’ Donuts, Baskin-Robbins and Nesquik were becoming household names and were a source of curiosity, excitement and, sometimes, suspicion. (Gorbachev was later criticised for his appearance in a 1998 advert for Pizza Hut that was only shown in the United States.) This was at a time when western visitors would still be stopped in the street and asked if they wanted to trade their Levi’s. For a brief period in the early 90s, you would perhaps be the only foreigner Russians had ever met in person. When I went to live in Russia the year after my first visit, return trips home would be dominated by long shopping lists of things Russians wanted: washing powder, tights, makeup, always jeans. These things were starting to become available but they weren’t always good quality or easy to get hold of. As a foreigner, I was also regarded as a handy source of information about new brands being advertised on television. The nine-year-old sister of one of my friends would quiz me on this relentlessly. Was Bounty really the taste of paradise? What did that mean? Had I tried Uncle Ben’s rice? How was it different from other rice? Who was Uncle Ben? Was it true that he had been to Russia? It’s almost impossible, 30 years on, to imagine a world with next to no branding and devoid of consumerism. But in the late Soviet period people were used to state restaurants – which often had no food and no visitors – bearing the name “Restaurant” and shops identifying themselves by a giant logo denoting “Bread” or “Fish”. (And often selling items completely other than bread or fish, if indeed they had any items at all.) In this climate, McDonald’s went early and went fast for maximum impact. The company had been in talks with Soviet officials about opening a branch since the mid-70s, so keen was it to get a foothold. But the innocence of the early 90s couldn’t last: Russians soon became demanding and discerning customers. Over the past two decades McDonald’s has had to compete with a growing array of homegrown Russian fast-food brands such as Kroshka Kartoshka (Little Potato), a baked potato emporium with more than 300 branches; Teremok, which also has 300 outlets and specialises in blini, borscht and pelmeni (dumplings); and Shokoladnitsa (Chocolate Girl), a coffee chain with more than 240 branches in the Moscow area alone. This level of competition has influenced the Russia-specific McDonald’s menu, which includes “country-style” potatoes (thick-cut wedges made with Russian potatoes), chicken wings, a non-alcoholic tarragon and mint mojito and the glamorous McShrimp – a Russian McDonald’s exclusive. My own memory of that first Moscow outing makes me smile at the naivety of it all. On that momentous visit, I paid (obviously). My Russian friends ate their way through the menu in reverential, delighted silence, pausing only to sigh with contentment, picturing their bright consumerist future. Then one of them looked up and asked eagerly, “Can we get more ‘s soboy’?” What does that mean, ‘s soboy’?” I asked? It literally means “with oneself”. A long explanation ensued and I finally understood to my horrified astonishment what they meant – “to take away”. They wanted to buy as many items as possible to take home so that everyone they knew could try these delicacies. I tried to explain that this was not the point of McDonald’s. But my protests were in vain. And so, we travelled back 400 miles on an overnight train journey to St Petersburg, transporting the ultimate status symbol: a paper bag of cold gamburgery, soggy and festering in their luxe branded wrappers.",News/Business,Putin’s war has closed every McDonald’s in Russia.

3/10/2022,"Dirty Russian money has polluted British democracy. The Conservatives have taken donations from Vladimir Putin’s chums without asking enough questions about where the cash is coming from. It is time to clean up Londongrad and also to wave goodbye to a burgeoning list of sanctioned oligarchs that now includes the owner of Chelsea, Roman Abramovich. That’s all completely true but it also doesn’t tell the whole story, which is that Russian money is just a part of an annual flow of foreign finance that enables us as a country to run permanent and massive trade deficits, where imports of goods and services are higher than exports. Put simply, we have been happy to take oligarch money so that we can live beyond our means. It is not just them, it is us. There was a time – many decades ago – when trade deficits were a big deal. Politicians used to fret about them. They were front-page news. Famously, a bad set of trade figures was supposed to have cost Labour the 1970 general election (although they probably didn’t). But since the early 1980s, Britain’s trade deficit has got bigger and we have worried about it less. Instead, we worry about why so many of our leading football clubs have foreign owners, or why so many of the utility companies are no longer in UK hands. A little known – but invaluable – government publication called the pink book helps explain why the two things are linked. The pink book provides an in-depth account of Britain’s balance of payments, which divides things up into a current account – which includes imports and exports of goods such as cars and computers, and trade in services such as banking or management consultancy – and a financial account that simply measures flows of money itself in and out of the country. The point about the balance of payments is that it has to balance. Countries such as the UK that run permanent trade deficits have to sell assets to foreign buyers to raise the cash to balance the books. Over time, Britain has run a cumulative trade deficit in goods and services of £1.3tn. But in the pink book that outflow has been matched by financial surpluses – cash – of the same amount. Money we got selling British assets to foreign buyers. The need to import foreign money became more pressing from the 1980s onwards. Britain has not run a surplus on manufactured goods since 1982 but for a time those deficits were more than matched by a surplus on services. But over time the deficit in goods grew bigger, reaching £20bn by 1990, £40bn by 2000 and £98bn by 2010. In 2019, the last year before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, it had climbed to almost £140bn. Increasingly large amounts of foreign capital were needed to offset these deficits. In some cases, this took the form of direct investment in new British factories, such as the car plants set up by Nissan, Toyota and Honda. In some cases, it took the form of international investors owning a bigger share of the companies quoted on the London stock exchange, which has risen from under 4% at the start of the 1980s to 56% currently. But oligarch money was also part of this process. Russians who had got rich from the privatisation of state-owned assets during the 1990s found a home for their money in the London property market. Financially, this was a smart move for them, as the limited number of mansions in Belgravia and Mayfair means prices are only ever going to move in one direction: up. Our economy needed the cash, so we were happy to take it. Russian money – like Middle Eastern oil money – has also found its way into the Premier League. For those football fans wondering why their club used to be owned by local businessmen in the 1970s but is now in the hands of foreign owners, the pink book has the answer. Mark Carney, when he was governor of the Bank of England, said the UK relied on the kindness of strangers to finance its trade deficit and he was quite right. What he might have added was that some of these strangers were pretty dodgy characters. The structure of our economy is simple. For decades Britons have consumed more than they have produced. And over the past 40 years the economy’s centre of gravity has shifted from manufacturing to financial and business services, centred on the City. London’s role as one of the world’s financial hubs has made it easy to attract foreign capital. So while making life as awkward as possible for Putin’s cronies might be a moral necessity given what is happening in Ukraine, two issues need to be addressed. The first is whether the UK should hand back any sequestered assets to any Russian people from whom they were stolen. The second is that even if London ceases to be the destination of choice for mafia bosses and drug dealers, a means will have to be found to balance the books. Logically, this can only be done in a number of ways. The UK can strengthen its manufacturing sector so that goods exports go up. It can do even better in those parts of the service sector where it already performs well, such as management consultancy and architecture.

3/10/2022,"The cost of watching Netflix hits from Bridgerton to The Crown is to increase, as the streaming platform raises its prices for subscribers in the UK and Ireland for the second time in less than 18 months. The move, the latest sign of the financial toll the growing competition is taking on the world’s most popular service, follows a round of price rises for UK subscribers in December 2020 and those in Ireland in March last year. Netflix, which has about 14 million UK subscribers and 600,000 in Ireland, according to Ampere Analysis, is to raise the price of its most popular package, which offers simultaneous viewing on two screens, HD and the ability to download shows and films to two devices, to £10.99 a month. It is also raising the price of its basic package for the first time in a decade. The entry-level plan, which allows viewers to watch only one screen at a time and download to one device, will rise by £1 a month to £6.99. The cost of Netflix’s premium plan, which allows Netflix to be watched on up to four different screens at a time and downloads to up to four devices, will increase by £2 a month to £15.99. In Ireland the basic plan will rise by €1 to €8.99, the standard package will increase from €12.99 to €14.99 and the premium tier will rise from €17.99 to €20.99. The price rises, which were expected after a hefty increase for its US subscribers in January, will come into effect immediately for new subscribers. Existing subscribers will get 30 days notice by email, depending on their billing cycle. Netflix said the increases were the inevitable cost associated with maintaining a continual pipeline of new content for viewers amid rising competition from rivals including Amazon’s Prime Video, Disney+ and HBO Max. “We have always been focused on providing our members both quality and clear value for their membership,” said a Netflix spokesperson. “Our updated prices reflect the investment we have made in our service and catalogue and will allow us to continue making the series, documentaries and films our members love as well as investing in talent and the creative industry. We offer a range of plans so members can choose a price that works best for them.” The UK is Netflix’s biggest production base for TV shows and films outside the US with a $1bn annual content spend. Before the two rounds of price rises Netflix’s most popular tier cost £8.99 and its premium plan cost £11.99. Its rival Disney+, which launched in the UK in early 2020, raised its prices from £5.99 to £7.99 last year. The decision was taken after it doubled its content by adding its Star service to Disney+, offering programmes designed to appeal to a wider non-Disney audience, such as Lost, Desperate Housewives, 24 and The X-Files.",News/Media,Netflix raises prices again for subscribers in UK and Ireland,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/10/netflix-prices-subscribers-uk-ireland
3/10/2022,"The Arsenal forward Vivianne Miedema says “action and not thoughts are needed” to help the victims of the war in Ukraine as she fronts an emergency response by Common Goal. Miedema and Paulo Dybala of Juventus are both representing the philanthropic organisation’s new initiative aimed at providing “immediate relief, and long-term sustainable support” for the millions of people affected by Russia’s invasion of its neighbour. Common Goal has more than 200 members – professional players and coaches – including the Liverpool manager, Jürgen Klopp, and the former Spain international Juan Mata. Its aim is to “unlock 1% of the entire football industry’s revenues” for charitable causes and “social change”. “I’ve been moved in recent days by the gestures from across our game in solidarity with Ukraine and calling for peace,” Miedama said. “My thoughts go out to all those affected by this senseless invasion. However, I know action and not thoughts are needed, which is why the Common Goal Team Up for Ukraine Emergency Response is so important at this time.” Extremely sad and angry about what is happening in Ukraine right now 💔No child should be part of #war.

3/10/2022,"For its latest show, the Almeida, in Islington, London, has looked back to theatre’s amateur origins for a template – specifically to the pageants by trade guilds that grew into the medieval mystery plays. Out of it has come a cycle of nine community pieces that will sing the song of local key workers in trios over three nights, with the whole lot repeated on Saturday. Day one gave us the teacher, the funeral director and the social care worker. A real-life teacher and school students bulk out the cast for the deftly choreographed opener, written by Sonali Bhattacharyya. It bounces between class and staffroom to show the impossible strain on schools, struggling to keep their students’ futures on track. “I’d have to tidy my room,” protests one boy, as Miss tries to persuade him to switch his camera on for a virtual lesson. A familiar story is freshly shocking when seen as a single piece of exuberant choric witness, with staff and kids singing for the same side. We’re slid into an altogether chillier ambience by a little gem of a black comedy written by Josh Elliott. A yuppie chats away in a barber’s chair while the jovial barber instructs his gangly assistant on how to administer a perfect shave. Except this is not a barber’s but a funeral parlour that is sprucing a young Covid victim up for a “meeting” with his grief-stricken father. Cleverly and tenderly it shows us the sort of care we will all one day need, even if we’d prefer not to think about it. As the corpse is wheeled offstage he is passed by a parade of elders in their glad rags who present the care workers’ case, written by Francesca Beard. Fragments of song and shards of anecdotes are tossed between 16 players, the oldest 96 years old, before they settle to a cautionary tale about who in our cut-throat society would be invited aboard Noah’s ark. The lucky few realise too late that the virus has set sail with them and there is nobody aboard who cares. This is thoughtfully enabled campfire theatre, a precious, collaborative improvisation to keep the darkness at bay and remind us who we are. Tears, I shed a few. The Key Workers Cycle is at the Almeida theatre, London, until 12 March.",Arts/Stage,The Key Workers Cycle review – a tender collaboration to keep the darkness at bay,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/10/the-key-workers-cycle-review-almeida-theatre-london
3/10/2022,"Over the last fortnight, Russians have risked fines, prison terms of up to 15 years, physical abuse and more to express the belief that their country’s invasion of Ukraine is not in their name. At time of writing, 13,789 protesters have been detained since 24 February. An observer scrolling Twitter or watching the detainee count ratchet up might think that the anti-war movement could threaten Vladimir Putin’s aggression in Ukraine. But the reality on the ground looks different: the anti-war movement is small, weak and faces serious obstacles. While the number of detentions is striking, it should not be confused with high turnout, because the detention rate is likely much higher than in normal conditions. Photos suggest that in many cities, the number of people at demonstrations is a few dozen or few hundred at most, with turnouts in Moscow and St Petersburg probably in the thousands. When it comes to protest, size matters. A larger protest is generally safer to attend, as the individual risk of repression usually drops as the turnout climbs. But size is also essential to achieve visibility, which communicates a message to the public. Protests could play an important role in communicating opposition and even information about the war to the Russian public. But given the extraordinary increase in media censorship, the sudden eradication of independent media, the throttling of key social networking sites, and extensive use of propaganda, these protests are more visible to audiences in the west than to the Russian public at large. The protests are also far too small to disrupt the status quo – another key measure of a protest’s effectiveness. An oft-cited statistic from Erica Chenoweth and Maria J Stephan suggests that non-violent movements are most likely to be successful when 3.5% of the population joins the protests. For Russia, that number is around 5 million people. Even if turnout in Moscow reaches the hundreds of thousands, there is little reason to believe that Putin, an isolated autocrat whose legacy now hangs on this war, will submit to their demands. Why aren’t these protests larger? Although many Russians are against the war, others are barely aware of it. Most Russians receive their news from state media, which is under strict instruction to refer to Russia’s actions in Ukraine as a “special military operation”; using the terms war, attack or invasion is now a crime. Though it is difficult to estimate what share of Russians believe the state line, misinformation and propaganda are incredibly widespread. The political opposition has been decimated in the last few years and is unable to coordinate an anti-war effort. Following the January 2021 protests in support of Alexey Navalny, his organisations were declared extremist and functionally eliminated. Other opposition political parties with national reach, such as Yabloko, are exceedingly unlikely to chance severe penalties for organising illegal protests, or expose their followers to repression. For individual activists, the landscape is also bleak. Many oppositionists are in self-imposed exile, and lack both the social media reach and the moral authority to call for protest. Those in Russia are rapidly repressed, such as human rights activist Marina Litvinovich, who was arrested on the day of the invasion, a few hours after she posted about protesting. The repressive landscape is changing rapidly, with new consequences for speaking out introduced seemingly on a daily basis, and many potential protesters have already begun leaving the country. As a result, there is no “anti-war movement” as such in Russia. The protests happening across the country have no coordinating body. Many have been planned through personal networks and social media posts. In some cases, opponents of the war have simply travelled to their nearest city centre in the hope of finding like-minded citizens. Many protests are single-person pickets. Although the Russian anti-war movement is not currently looking likely to change the course of the war, that does not mean it will have no effect. Repression often leads to innovation in protest and new leaders and organisers may emerge. For instance, soldiers’ mothers, a group with a long history of political activism in Russia, may organise against the mistreatment of troops. As the consequences of sanctions are felt across society, more Russians may oppose the war. Demonstrations against specific economic grievances such as wage arrears, inflation and declining pensions have been common under Putin. Yet Russians also exhibit a tendency to put their heads down when the economy sours, as they did during the economic downturn that followed the 2014 seizure of Crimea. Even if anti-war protests remain small, they prove to the world that Putin does not represent the will of all Russians.
