4/21/2022,"The images and video began circulating on social media almost immediately. When reports first emerged last week of an explosion on the Moskva, Russia's flagship in the Black Sea, posts purporting to be of the carnage and aftermath soon followed. The ship was both a symbol of Russia’s strength as well as a key cog in its military operations. Its sinking and the unverified circumstances around the explosion — Ukraine said it hit the ship with missiles, Russia said ammunition damaged the ship and it sank in a stormy sea — quickly led to an appetite for anything that might show what really happened. Most of the claims were quickly debunked by professional news organizations and amateur analysts, often referred to as the open-source intelligence community (OSINT for short). In some, the ship didn’t match the Moskva’s profile. Others were quickly found to be old videos. But a couple of pictures that emerged in recent days are different. Images and a short video appeared to show thick black smoke billowing from a warship bearing a striking resemblance to the Moskva. The photos were new. The ship was clearly a Slava-class cruiser, of which the Moskva was one of three. By using archive photos, the NBC News Social Newsgathering team matched the shape and infrastructure of the ship — including its dome-shaped fire-control radar, helicopter hangar, helipad and distinctive dark gray paint. Some lingering doubts remain. NBC News could not determine who originally took the video or images, or why they are only being shared now. The Pentagon has also said the images cannot be verified. But experts who spoke with NBC News said they believed that the photos, assuming they have not been doctored, showed the Moskva. The photos showed no signs of alteration. James Stavridis, a retired U.S. Navy admiral, said there was a high chance that they showed the Russian vessel. “In today’s world, with the ability to produce deep fakes of just about anything, I wouldn’t bet my life on an assessment,” he said. “I would say this is in fact the Moskva. It certainly appears to be a Slava-class cruiser. They are utterly distinctive with the missile tubes up forward. No other Slavas or similar ships have been sunk in distress that I know of or can find. Occam’s Razor tells me this is very probably the Slava class cruiser Moskva.” Bradley Martin, a senior policy researcher with the Rand Corp. and a former surface warfare captain in the U.S. Navy, said all available evidence points to the Moskva as the ship in the photo. “There are no other ships of this kind that have been damaged, and the damage is consistent with the reports,” he said in an email. Capt. Patrick Kulakowski, a military professor at the Russia Maritime Studies Institute at the U.S. Naval War College, offered a similar assessment. “I don’t know if anything is doctored, but that is a Slava class,” he said. “They only have three of them, and we know that [the other two] are alive and well.” The NBC News Social Newsgathering team also noted that one of the images circulating online showed the ship noticeably leaning portside and that a rescue tugboat could be faintly seen behind the Moskva spraying two streams of water into the air. A low-quality, three-second video also showed a similar scene of the warship on fire, as a tugboat approached the vessel. The recording ended abruptly when a man yells in Russian: “What the f--- are you doing?”",World/NBC News,Images appear to show carnage of sinking warship Moskva,https://news.yahoo.com/first-images-appear-show-russian-145215054.html

4/21/2022,"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen led a walkout of a G-20 economic meeting. Yellen, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, and other global economic leaders left when Russian officials spoke. The coordinated action underlines Russia's increasing isolation as it continues its war in Ukraine. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Fed Chair Jerome Powell joined top economic leaders from around the world in walking out of a G-20 meeting on Wednesday after Russian officials began speaking, underlining the increasing isolation the Kremlin faces as Russia continues its war in Ukraine, The Washington Post reports. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, Moscow's top economic official, was expected to attend the conference remotely, The Post reports. The US sanctioned Siluanov earlier this month. Ukrainian officials addressed the gathering before the Russians started speaking. The coordinated action was in the works before the meeting began, Reuters previously reported. An unnamed US official told the outlet that Yellen planned to avoid most sessions attended by Russian officials. An unnamed British official also said that British finance minister Rishi Sunak would also not attend some sessions. The G-20 was founded in 1999 as a way for top finance officials and central bank leaders from the world's largest economies to meet to coordinate policy. The group later expanded to include heads of state. The smaller G-7 started in the 1970s amid global energy concerns and a recession. It grew to be known as the G-8 when Russia later joined in 1998, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, but its membership was suspended in 2014 following its annexation of Crimea and the exclusive club again became known as the G-7. President Joe Biden and other Western leaders have called for Russia to be kicked out of the G-20 following its unprovoked war in Ukraine. The US and many of the G-20 nations have also responded by enacting severe sanctions on Russia. Biden has made clear that the US hopes to devastate the Russian economy. A Treasury Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
