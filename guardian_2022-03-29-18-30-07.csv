3/29/2022,"You can at least credit the Coalition with not being subtle. This was always going to be a budget to get re-elected rather than one that bothered with anything so tawdry as economic growth or ongoing structural issues in the economy. Pass the sugar and keep heaping it out until the election – and we’ll deal with the consequences later. This would all be fine and reasonable if the budget papers themselves did not reveal that the government fully expects that the economy, after this injection of economic glucose, will return to the meagre growth levels of the pre-pandemic period and that real wages will remain below what they were at the 2019 election until 2025. First let’s look at the reason the government is boasting about a better-than-expected deficit and also why it is being so free with one-off spending. Since the dark days of the pandemic and the 2020-21 budget, the government has found itself with about $270bn extra revenue from 2020-21 to 2024-25 than was initially expected. Rather astonishingly, the Treasury now expects $133.5bn more tax revenue over the five years from this financial year out to 2025-26 than it did just three months ago in December’s mid-year economic and fiscal outlook: And so, rather than a $106.6bn deficit this financial year – as was expected last year – the government now expects the deficit to be a “mere” $79.8bn. This equates to about 3.4% of GDP, a figure well down on the 6.5% of GDP deficit in 2020-21 but still the fourth biggest non-pandemic deficit on record – and bigger than all but one year of the global financial crisis. The reason it is not worse is purely that extra revenue, because if there is one thing we can be grateful for, given the coming election, it is that there was no way this was going to be an austerity budget. Over the next four years, government spending will fall from 27.2% of GDP in the next financial year to 26.3% in 2025-26. While that might sound like a big cut, recall that it would still be 0.4% of GDP (or about $10bn by 2025) more than Labor’s Wayne Swan ever outlaid in his time as treasurer – including the year of his biggest deficit in 2009-10: This is not to criticise the government – worries about budget deficits and debt truly get far too much attention, especially when, as we have seen, debt itself has very little to do with inflation and interest rates. And yet despite the surge of extra revenue and spending, there is little to look forward to, once you actually look past the next year and the federal election. The economy is expected to grow slightly above average next year but then from 2023-24 onwards we are back to 2.5% growth. That is essentially where we were for the years after the GFC leading up to the pandemic – years that were not by anyone’s measure strong. But when we look at the level of public demand dropping off in 2023-24, is it any real surprise? The government might not be practising austerity now but it still believes the private sector should deliver growth. And unfortunately it appears unable to deliver more than a middling amount: But the real lack of ongoing economic health is most evident in wages. Last year inflation grew by 3.8%, compared with just 1.7% for wages. This real wage decline has continued this year, with inflation growing 1.25 percentage points faster than wages. The government expects with some (as usual optimistic) assumptions that real wages will grow in 2022-23 and beyond. But so massive has been the hit to real wages in these two years that it is not until 2025 that the government expects that value of real wages to return to above what they were at the 2019 election – and that is assuming inflation falls quicker than many economists believe it will: And what about those wages forecasts? Well, as we know, this government has not had a great record of forecasting wages. Sally McManus and Anthony Albanese have been declaring that since the 2012-13 Myefo the government has made 55 wage predictions, 52 of which have been wrong. At least the last few have been not over-optimistic and should come to pass – but I fear we are again returning to the realms of the predictive sins of previous budgets: As I have been noting regularly since 2016, the relationship between wages growth and unemployment has shifted significantly. In the past the government has always desired to see wages growth increasing sharply, despite little changes in the unemployment rate. Once again we see the same. While not as egregious as previously, such as in the 2019-20 budget when it was predicted wages growth would jump from 2.5% to 3.5% in four years despite no fall in unemployment, there is still expected to be a strong increase in wages growth above what we have observed since 2016: This would definitely be welcome, but fool me 52 times … The lack of real wages growth is the reason the government has had to force itself to dole out the tax cuts. As I noted last week, had the government merely kept in place the low to middle income tax offset there would actually have been no tax cut, just a continuation of one already in place – but which is forever a “one-off” temporary measure. Now the government has added another one-off temporary measure – an extra $420 flat rate to the LMITO. This of course has not stopped the government from boasting that you will get up to $1,500 in tax relief (the previous maximum of $1,080 plus the new $420). Crucially, this is just for this year. What it means is this year someone on the median income of about $60,000 will receive a 0.7% tax cut. But should the LIMTO not be extended next year, that person will receive a 2.5% tax increase next year: It becomes in effect a tax cut that will forever be delivered anew, and not actually made permanent – unlike the stage three cuts due to come into effect in 2024-25 which will give someone on $200,0000 a 4.5% tax cut. And this is the real heart of why this budget is just a sugar hit with no sense of ongoing growth. The government predicts households will continue to spend in big numbers – with household spending growing by 5.75% in 2023-24. That would be the biggest annual increase in household consumption since 1974-75, and yet it would come at a time where real wages are lower than in the past and the offsets are projected to be removed. So how will we keep spending? By reducing our savings. The budget predicts that the savings rate will fall from its current level of above 10% to below 5%. The government hopes you have saved up and are ready to spend over the next few years, because it knows your actual ability to spend will remain less than it was in the past for at least three or four years to come.",News/Australia news,Federal budget 2022: six graphs that reveal the sugar-hit election strategy  | Greg Jericho,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/grogonomics/2022/mar/29/australia-federal-budget-2022-six-graphs-you-need-to-see-greg-jericho
3/29/2022,"Australia’s near-term economic fortunes hinge largely on household incomes rising at a faster pace than inflation but not so fast that they prompt an overly rapid series of interest rate increases by the central bank, according to the 2022-23 federal budget. The delicate balance is at the heart of a budget – and election campaign – strategy that relies on an assumption additional handouts in the form of fuel excise relief and an expanded tax offset for mostly middle-income taxpayers don’t fan inflation further. Even while the Morrison government can justly point to Australia outperforming many of our developed peers, the country’s economic dynamism is predicted to slow rapidly, with GDP growth in 2022 of 4.75% halving and then some to 2% next year. The main bragging point of a jobless rate dropping to 3.75% by September – the lowest since 1974 – could be a sore spot if wages end up lagging inflation by 1.5 percentage points during 2021-22, as the budget predicts. Much faster growth, though, will place greater onus on the Reserve Bank to lift the cash rate quicker lest inflationary expectations become “unanchored”, as the budget papers state. The budget, though, does carry some upside risks, such as an outlook based on commodity prices falling back to more normal levels by September. Treasury has made conservative predictions before, and they may prove so again given iron ore prices remain about triple previous forecasts, while distortions to global markets caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – that propelled coal to record highs – don’t look like subsiding soon. Despite these caveats, the budget is confident about Australia’s resilience and that the country will continue to fare better than most others, including keeping inflation in check. Even the ongoing floods in Queensland and NSW will barely dent growth. “The Australian economy has proved remarkably resilient to the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, consistently outperforming expectations and exceeding pre-pandemic levels of activity by more than the major advanced economies,” the budget papers state. Shoring up households will be the extra $420 added to this year’s low and middle income tax offset, lifting it to $1,500 for this fiscal year. The government had dangled culling the temporary outlay as a sign of its fiscal rectitude but that turned out to be a $4.1bn red herring of extra spending, not a saving of about $8bn. Other headline measures to ease the cost of living pressures include $1.5bn to provide a one-off, tax-exempt payment of $250 to six million eligible pensioners, welfare recipients, and others. Likewise, a six-month halving of the 44.2 cents a litre fuel excise will cost $3bn over the forward estimates, but at least this measure will trim inflation by 0.25 percentage points this year. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Despite that additional spending – and other programs – the budget expects inflation to “peak well below that in most other advanced economies”. It doesn’t say what that peak is, but by June, consumer price will be at 4.25% before subsiding to 3% by June 2023 and 2.75% by a year later. By contrast, the wage price index will lag with a 2.75% reading for this fiscal year – implying a real reduction of 1.5 percentage point – before exceeding CPI in the following year with a 3.25% rise, and then quickening to 3.5% for the following two years and exceeding inflation. Economists, though, are already predicting consumer prices will be rising at a 5% clip by mid-year, and that the RBA will soon start to respond by jacking up the cash rate from its record low of 0.1% that it has sat at for 15 months. As ANZ recently noted, “the last time the RBA increased the cash rate was 2010, so many borrowers have no experience of rising mortgage rates”. Just how much rates will rise is hard to predict but the CBA – Australia’s largest mortgage issuer – predicts the RBA will keep lifting them until they reach 1.25% by the first quarter of next year. “However, if fiscal policy ends up more stimulatory than we anticipate and the government injects a material amount of policy support to deal with ‘cost-of-living pressures’ we may need to upwardly revise our forecast profile for the cash rate in 2023,” Gareth Aird, the CBA’s head of Australian economics said before the budget. RateCity.com did some number crunching based on the CBA’s prediction that the RBA’s cash rate will rise from the record low 0.1% to 1.25% by next February. Analysts at https://t.co/NoPj8xWJYB have kindly crunched some numbers about what a lift in the official RBA cash rate to 1.25% by next February would do to repayments on average loan sizes (assuming the banks pass on the increase). Worth contrasting with #Budget2022 handouts. pic.twitter.com/SnvSv30iBy They found the average new home loan customer in Australia would see their monthly repayments rise by an estimated $381 by February next year. In NSW, repayments would rise by an estimated $495 a month by February, assuming their loan size is $804,675. (That’s the average recorded by the ABS for January.) The calculation also assumes the mortgage holder is on the average RBA new customer variable interest rate of 2.52% and has a 30-year owner-occupier principal and interest home loan. The budget papers don’t predict where interest rates will go, only that they assume they “move broadly in line with market expectations”. As of Monday, though, investors were predicting the RBA’s rate could reach as high as 3% by August 2023. “Our analysis indicates that a cash rate of 2.50% is deeply contractionary and would result in mortgage payments as a share of household disposable income rising to a record high,” the CBA said, prior to the budget, using data going back to 1999. The Morrison government, of course, is banking on one aspect of those rate rise forecasts being right: that they don’t start until June, or after the election.",News/Australia news,"Australia’s budget is banking on wages outpacing inflation and interest rates, but not by too much",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/australia-federal-budget-2022-economy-cost-of-living-petrol-fuel-excise-australia
3/29/2022,"Twenty fixed penalty notices will be issued for breaches of Covid rules following allegations of lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street, Scotland Yard has said. The Metropolitan police said the fines were the first to be issued and that those who received the fines would not be named publicly, according to the professional practice guidance for fixed penalty notices. The Guardian reported on Monday night that 20 fines were expected for the most straightforward cases, with Boris Johnson unlikely to be among them as he has denied breaking the law. In a statement on Tuesday, the force said there was a “significant amount of investigative material that remains to be assessed” and that further fines would be issued if the evidence threshold was met. Police are investigating 12 separate events in 2020 and 2021, six of which Johnson is said to have attended. The force said it had obtained more than 300 photographs and 500 pages of documents, stemming from a Whitehall inquiry by the senior civil servant Sue Gray. The Downing Street gatherings included a summer drinks party where attenders were invited to “bring your own booze”, leaving dos for civil servants and an alleged gathering in Johnson’s flat. No 10 has promised to reveal if the prime minister receives an FPN but has so far declined to say whether he has been interviewed by police. The Met said it would not confirm the number of referrals from each individual event, saying that may inadvertently lead to identification of the individuals. Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said Johnson should resign if he were fined and so should his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who has also been issued with a police questionnaire about lockdown gatherings. Asked if it was the right moment to trigger a Conservative leadership contest, Rayner said: “I think it’s important the support that we’ve given to the Ukrainian people, and we’ve been very clear in supporting the government in that and I think that’s a very serious situation and that it’s right that we’ve been united on that. “But that doesn’t negate the prime minister from lying to the British public and if he thinks it does then he’s sadly mistaken.” The Liberal Democrats said the breaches within Downing Street were enough to compel Johnson to resign even if he was not personally fined. The Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, said: “If Boris Johnson thinks he can get away with partygate by paying expensive lawyers and throwing junior staff to the wolves, he is wrong. We all know who is responsible. The prime minister must resign, or Conservative MPs must sack him.” Johnson is likely to find himself under pressure to explain comments to parliament and the media when news of the breaches first broke in the Mirror last year. At prime minister’s questions in December, he said “all guidance was followed completely in No 10”. After a leaked video to ITV showed staff joking about having cheese and wine, he apologised for the “impression it gives” but said: “I have been repeatedly assured since these allegations emerged, that there was no party and that no Covid rules were broken.” During the course of the two-month investigation, the Met sent questionnaires to more than 100 members of staff and aides, including Johnson and his wife, Carrie; the head of the civil service, Simon Case; and the prime minister’s former principal private secretary Martin Reynolds. Images that have been examined by police include photos taken at parties and those taken from security cameras showing when people entered and exited buildings. The education minister Will Quince said gatherings that took place across Downing Street and Whitehall during Covid restrictions “shouldn’t have happened” but declined to say Johnson should resign if he broke the law. “I entirely understand why you asked that question. I understand the huge public interest,” he told Sky on Tuesday. “I completely understand the considerable upset caused – the events that took place shouldn’t have happened. “But I hope you’ll understand that both as an education minister, but more importantly, as there’s ongoing live Metropolitan police investigation, it’s just not appropriate that I comment.”",News/UK news,Met says 20 fixed penalty notices to be issued over Downing Street parties,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/29/met-says-20-fixed-penalty-notices-to-be-issued-over-downing-street-parties
3/29/2022,"Commonwealth spending on flood recovery will top $6bn over the next four years, as budget papers reveal the federal government will again dip into its Emergency Response Fund and spend the maximum annual allocation of $150m in the upcoming financial year. The Morrison government’s decision to spend the entire Emergency Response Fund annual allocation in the 2022-23 financial year comes 11 days after it backflipped on its long-held resistance to accessing the $4bn pool of funding when it announced it would withdraw $150m for the current financial year. While the first withdrawal from the fund was to be split evenly between the New South Wales and Queensland governments to pay for recovery efforts, budget papers state that $150m from the fund to be spent in 2022-23 will be provided to “fast track recovery and post-disaster resilience”. The government will engage the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), at a cost of $10.4m over two years, to identify the most promising projects for flood mitigation in the NSW northern rivers region. Tuesday’s federal budget included a comprehensive flood package, which outlined a raft of new measures including providing two additional $1,000 Disaster Recovery Payments to residents in catastrophically impacted areas who have already claimed their initial payments. The government believes these two additional payments will cost $245m in coming months, and take its total spending on disaster payments as a result of the floods to $450m by July. The government will also spend $10m over four years on a program called Resilient Kids, designed to deliver mental health care and trauma education to primary and secondary students in the NSW northern rivers affected by recent floods. Childcare providers in flood affected communities will receive $22.1m to help them continue operations, while the commonwealth will provide $5m in “targeted support” to non-government schools in NSW and Queensland affected by the floods. Small businesses affected by the floods will also be able to access free financial counselling, at a cost of $800,000, while the government will give $1.7m to Emergency Management Australia to integrate with the National Resource Sharing Centre “to better share resources and capability information across states and territories and the Commonwealth during large-scale disasters”. While the government’s plans for spending on floods are less clear after the upcoming financial year, it has budgeted to spend a further $3bn in disaster payments and allowances related to this year’s NSW and Queensland floods by June 2026. One reason for this large anticipated spend is because the commonwealth pays up to 75% of the cost of public assets, such as rebuilding roads. In announcing the flood package, the emergency management minister, Bridget McKenzie, said “we are listening to communities and providing funding for support where it is needed most”. “These budget initiatives will play a critical role in supporting disaster-impacted local communities and businesses to recover as quickly as possible and be better prepared for future events,” McKenzie said. The Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, in his budget delivery speech said the flood package “will deliver hope, work and the prospect of returning to a better life”. “Nothing I say can overcome the personal pain and loss of so many Australians. We will stand with these communities and help them rebuild,” Frydenberg said. A large share of the commonwealth’s expected $6bn total spend on floods by June 2026 include reimbursing the NSW and Queensland state governments for joint-funding efforts previously announced. The NSW and federal governments had previously announced jointly funded measures including a $100m package for small and medium businesses in the LGAs of Lismore, Ballina, Byron, Kyogle, the Richmond Valley, Clarence Valley and Tweed. They have also announced $35m in rural landholder grants, $150m for the primary industry sector to protect supply chains, $142m for property assessments and demolitions, $300m to pay for cleaning up debris, and $285.2m for temporary housing packages including motor homes and housing pods. The Queensland and federal governments have so far jointly funded $558.5m in measures, including $75,000 grants for primary producers, $50,000 grants for small businesses and non-profits, and $20,000 for sporting and community clubs.",News/Australia news,Budget reveals flood recovery spend to top $6bn in four years after NSW and Queensland disasters,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/australia-federal-budget-2022-flood-recovery-spend-6bn-four-years-nsw-queensland-floods-disasters-lismore-northern-rivers-south-east-qld-emergency-response
3/29/2022,"A new wave of Covid-19 is likely to hit Australia this winter, the government assumes in the budget, causing high rates of absenteeism and pressure on supply chains. It forecasts the economic impact of outbreaks will continue to diminish but raises the possibility of a more bleak outlook if a more virulent variant emerges. The budget allocates $4.2bn in 2022-23 for the response to the pandemic, including $1bn for the further rollout of vaccines, $2.6bn to replenish the stockpile of personal protective equipment and millions more rapid antigen tests for use in residential aged care and high-risk disability care settings. “Beyond winter, it is assumed that Australia will continue to experience intermittent, localised waves of Omicron, or other new Covid-19 variants,” the budget papers say. “However, it is assumed that high vaccination rates and improved medical treatments, together with continued community adaptation to Covid-19, will see the economic impact of future outbreaks continue to moderate.” The budget assumes that public health measures including physical distancing and density restrictions will be relaxed but may be “reimposed in a targeted way” in response to outbreaks. “These public health measures are not expected to materially affect the economic forecasts,” Treasury said. But it also considers two alternative Covid scenarios: one negative and one more positive. In the negative scenario, Australia experiences “a more challenging-than-expected health environment” due to the arrival of a more virulent variant in the middle of 2022, coinciding with the flu season. As a result, workforce absenteeism would return to levels similar to those experienced in January, while reimposed density limits and reduced social mixing would result in weaker consumption. This would result in GDP being 0.5% lower, unemployment being 0.25% higher than forecast, and household savings increasing. But Treasury says the impact would be short lived and the economy would rebound quickly, as it has after previous outbreaks, to return to the forecast levels in the first quarter of 2023. The more positive scenario of an improved health situation would deliver a boost to confidence and greater household spending, leading to an improved economy. Josh Frydenberg used his budget speech to reassert the Coalition’s commitment to Medicare, in an attempt to head off another “Mediscare” campaign by Labor in the imminent federal election campaign. “Medicare is guaranteed,” the treasurer said. The nation’s health budget will top $132bn in 2022-23, up from $62bn a decade ago, driven by rising healthcare costs, the expansion of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, the response to Covid-19 and the addition of $2.3bn over four years for mental health announced in last year’s budget. Medicare will cost $31.4bn in 2022-23, an increase of $7.3bn compared with the previous year, reflecting the increased use of doctors and telehealth during the pandemic. The government noted that telehealth had been the most significant reform to Medicare since its creation and was “the key landmark reform” within the government’s primary healthcare 10-year plan. Since March 2020 more than 100m telehealth services have been delivered to 17 million people.

As part of the government’s package to reduce the cost of living the government will also reduce the PBS safety net thresholds so that about 2.4 million people will qualify more quickly for free or discounted prescription medicines. For general patients the threshold is reduced from $1,542.10 to $1,457.10 and for concession card holders from $326.40 to $244.80.

3/29/2022,"Icall Victoria Derbyshire’s team to say I’m at Broadcasting House in central London. Before the sentence is out, she is standing in front of me. The BBC journalist has always been one step ahead of the game. The expression “Don’t mourn, organise!” could have been invented for her. Every time the journalist has had a crisis – and there have been plenty – she has done something about it. Whether it was surviving her father’s domestic violence, getting cancer in her 40s, or finding out from the newspapers that her TV show was to be axed, she has always been quick to act when faced with adversity. When Russia invaded Ukraine, she acted again. A couple of days earlier, Jonathan Aspinwall, BBC news’s podcast supremo, had asked if she fancied co-hosting a podcast on Ukraine with Newsnight’s Gabriel Gatehouse. On 24 February, she woke up at 4am, an hour after Vladimir Putin announced the launch of a “special military operation”. “I WhatsApped Jonathan and said: ‘We need to do the first podcast today.’” Ukrainecast has become a must-listen for those keen to contextualise the latest horrors of the war. The daily podcast takes a deep dive into a topical theme, calling on the BBC’s bank of experts and talking to those struggling to survive in Ukraine or trying to escape. It does what 53-year-old Derbyshire has done so well throughout her career – establish relationships with people and return to them time and again, so we have an investment in their lives. Here, this makes the terrible numbers game of war intimate and personal. I tell her how much I like Ukrainecast. “Why?” she asks. It’s typical Derbyshire. Most people would settle for the compliment and move on, but she puts me to the test. She wants to know if I really like it and why – partly to learn (she is incredibly inquisitive) and partly because she can’t stop herself asking questions. Derbyshire, who joined the BBC 28 years ago after graduating from Liverpool University with a degree in English and Preston Polytechnic (now the University of Central Lancashire) with a postgraduate diploma in journalism, is an exceptionally good interviewer. With vulnerable people, she is empathic without being saccharine. With politicians, she is tough without being strident. Derbyshire gets the coffees in at a cafe next to the BBC. When she returns, she checks the latest headlines on her phone. As well as the podcast, she co-presents the BBC’s lunchtime news. She has also just learned a new skill of which she is particularly proud. For the past four months, she has been making short films on TikTok, highlighting the stories of the day. “They’ve had over 50m views,” she says, proudly. She loves TikTok, because it’s targeted at young people who will quickly tell you when you are getting it wrong. “I’ve learned such a lot. I get amazing feedback. I put up a story about police officers not being vetted properly and someone asked what vetted means. Journalists throw these terms in and, if we don’t explain them, it excludes people.” She is a dab hand at marketing herself. TikTok has provided her with a new audience, just as I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! did when she appeared on the 2020 series. “Young kids stop me on the train. They don’t know me from doing the news or doing my programme. But they know me from TikTok and I’m a Celeb.” Derbyshire grew up in Rochdale, Lancashire, the oldest of three children. Her mother, Pauline, was – and remains – her inspiration. “My mum was a brilliant primary school teacher. She taught all three of us.” Did you have to call her Mrs Derbyshire? “Course. What else would you call her?” Mum? “No, she had to be completely impartial, though when we used to go up and have our books marked she would put her hand up my skirt and rub the back of my leg as a secret sign that actually I was her daughter and she was my mum.” She laughs. “In a comforting way, not an inappropriate way!” As for her father, the family lived in fear of him and his violent outbursts. On one occasion, he poured a cup of boiling soup over Derbyshire. “When I was a young teenager, I ran to the police station to get help for my mum when my father was beating her up. They took two hours to get there.” When the police arrived, her father invited them in for a cup of tea and they left happy. “I wonder if that was a point in my head when I thought: ‘OK, don’t rely on other people; if you need something doing, do it yourself.’” Her father, who ran a building company, went bankrupt. Bills went unpaid and the phone and electricity were cut off. Did she ever think her father would kill her mother? “Yes,” she says, baldly. She tells her two teenage boys that, if they are faced with a bully, they should fight back with humour. Is that what she did? “God no, there was no humour there. The older I got, the more confident I became with language. He would get words wrong and I wouldn’t dare laugh, but I would say: ‘Don’t you mean such-and-such a word?’ and that would really piss him off.” You knew it would? “Yes. It was my only way of trying to get one over him. I couldn’t physically match him.” In 2020, Derbyshire made a Panorama programme about domestic violence and spoke about her experience. When Derbyshire was 16, her mother took Derbyshire and her siblings and walked away. She never saw her father again. In 2020, he died of a stroke. The family didn’t attend his funeral. Was she glad when he died? “I was completely emotionless, because I don’t want to spend any of my energy thinking about him. Life is short. I think this feeling’s really intensified since cancer. I love my family, I love my friends, we have the best time – and I’m not wasting time on people that …” She trails off. She has two glitzy rings on her wedding finger. Wow, that’s a lot of diamonds, I say. She grins. “Loads of diamonds, man! Aren’t they gorgeous? These are the engagement and wedding rings my stepdad bought for my mum. How fab is that?” She adored her stepfather, Des, who was married to her mother for 20 years before dying at 56. “Des was a proper dad to us. I never regarded my biological father as a proper father. When Mark and I got married, Mum gave them to us. So my stepdad is with me all the time.” In 2018, Derbyshire married her long-term partner, Mark Sandell, the father of her sons, who runs a radio and podcast production company. After she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015, she told him that, if they got through it, she would like to get married. She never expected to make it. But after six rounds of chemotherapy and 30 sessions of radiotherapy, she was told in 2017 that there was no evidence of active cancer. There is an 11% chance of the cancer recurring. She went into practical mode after her diagnosis. She made plans in case she didn’t survive, telling Mark that he would have to sell the house, because he wouldn’t be able to afford the mortgage on a single salary. As she has done so often, she turned her experience into journalism. She made a series of powerful video diaries, documenting the gruelling treatment, the loss of her hair, her changing moods and how she was coping. Derbyshire was determined to make people more aware of breast cancer. So, two years after her mastectomy, she stripped off in front of a live audience for ITV’s The Real Full Monty. Then, last year, she launched the podcast And Then Came Breast Cancer. If ever there were a cancer programme that could be uplifting, this is it. Her latest guest was the Labour MP Dawn Butler, who spoke to Derbyshire for the podcast and BBC Breakfast about Butler’s recent breast cancer diagnosis, which she revealed yesterday, and the lower uptake of screening tests among women of colour. Derbyshire says she is unwilling to waste her energy on negativity and anger, particularly since her diagnosis. This was put to the test in January 2020 when she read in the Times that her BBC Two programme was going to be axed, as part of a wider set of cuts. Called Victoria Derbyshire, it ran every weekday for two hours. It did something no other morning magazine show was doing, covering heavy-duty subjects (such as the contaminated blood inquiry) and regularly breaking news stories (exclusives included the story of a woman who proved her father was a rapist using her own DNA as evidence; a harrowing 45-minute interview with four footballers who had been sexually abused by the football coach Barry Bennell; and 800 women suing over vaginal mesh implants). The management team claimed the show was too costly and that it hadn’t grown its audience. As usual, Derbyshire tackled it head on. She called out her bosses, stating that the show had met the targets it had been set: to get millions of digital views and reach people who don’t think the BBC is for them. How did she react when she read that the show was being pulled? Her first mission, she says, was to find out if it was true. “I texted my immediate boss just before I went on air. No reply. I texted his boss. No reply. And then, after the programme, I received a really shit, cold message, which told me nothing, so I went to find them. They were in a meeting, so I basically doorstepped them.” The people in the meeting were Gavin Allen, who was head of news programmes, and Fran Unsworth, the director of news and current affairs – both of whom have since left the BBC. “They said: ‘Oh, this was meant to come out next week,’ and I said: ‘What was meant to come out next week?’ I was so fucking steely it was untrue. I was determined not to cry. Fran Unsworth said: ‘W-w-w-w-we-we weren’t meant to announce this till ...’ She was shaking. And I said: ‘What is it that you weren’t going to announce till next week?’ because I wanted to make her say it. “And she said: ‘We are – we are – we are – we’ve taken the decision to close the programme.’ I was like: ‘You’re fucking kidding me?’ She said she was sorry it leaked out. I said: ‘What about being sorry about closing the programme and the impact on the team’s jobs? It’s a disgrace.’” The meeting went on for almost an hour, Derbyshire says. “In the end, Gavin Allen said: ‘We’d be really grateful if you could keep this to yourself till next Wednesday.’ I just laughed and said: ‘You’re fucking joking, aren’t you?’” Her voice rises in pitch. “And then I just left.” You must have been angry then, I say. “You’re desperate for me to say I’m angry. I wasn’t angry. I was gutted, I was devastated, but I immediately went into practical mode, fighting mode. What can we do? How can we change this? We had some amazing people on our team. Young, diverse people, who left the BBC because they had no job.” When I approach Allen for a response, he says: “It was an appalling way to have learned the news, which I said, apologising on the BBC’s behalf, to the entire Derbyshire team.” But, he adds: “It wasn’t about ‘keeping the news to herself until the following week’; it was about giving the wider team the remaining courtesy to explain the decision and discuss it with them face to face [first].” Unsworth did not respond to a request for comment. A campaign began to save the show. Derbyshire even ended up reporting on the decision, live-tweeting from the BBC staff presentation about the cuts. “Head of Internal Comms jst said to us all, ‘enjoy and relax’,” she told her followers on Twitter. But the campaign ended with a whimper when it was overtaken by the pandemic. I ask how she has managed to rebuild her trust with the BBC. “I haven’t got a trust issue with the BBC,” she says. “It’s not the BBC, is it? It’s individuals. The management have all changed now. It really depends who’s in charge. I’ve had some amazing bosses and I’ve had some non-human bosses.” Like who? “I’m never going to tell you that in a million years.” She says she loves the two jobs she is doing and is as hungry to tell stories as she has ever been. I ask if she feels there is an existential threat to the BBC, with the government treating it as a political football. “I’m going to choose my words carefully,” she says. The idea of Derbyshire being discreet is funny, as much of her appeal lies in the fact that she isn’t. “I was grateful when the culture secretary stood up in the House of Commons and appreciated all the journalists that are out in Ukraine right now bringing the truth to audiences across the world.” Anyway, she says, the BBC’s coverage of the war has been brilliant and it has proved once again why the country needs a public service broadcaster. “Millions of viewers and listeners are turning to the BBC right now because they trust it, because it’s accurate, because they like the correspondents who are out there, because they’re human beings. This is what we do and we shouldn’t forget that.” Isn’t it about time she looked for her next big job? I remind her that there is a vacancy at Newsnight, now that Emily Maitlis is leaving to launch a podcast and host a radio show with Jon Sopel for Global. Would she fancy that gig? “Errrrr, I think everyone will go for that. Look, I’ve got two jobs at the moment,” she protests. Has the BBC advertised the job yet? “I have no idea. That is a very good question.” As we wind up, a producer friend runs into the cafe with the news that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been released after being imprisoned for six years in Iran. “Oh. My. Fucking. God,” Derbyshire says. “Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.” She takes a deep breath. “I messaged them all last night to say I’ve got my fingers crossed for you. Oh my God, that’s amazing. Can I just check that?” She picks up her phone. “Oh my God, she’s on her way home to the UK.” Now I see first-hand how much journalism means to her. She is almost hyperventilating with joy. “Oh. My. God. I feel like I want to cry.” She is welling up. “Wow!” She tells me that, when Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband, Richard, was on hunger strike recently, she spent 90 minutes with him, just chatting to him and his mum. “Wow! He’s amazing. But she’s amazing, too. Jeeeeeesus. Wow! See! I’m just so happy. Some positivity in the gloom. Wow! Right, I’ve got to go to work and do this. I’m going to do a TikTok straight away saying: ‘Oh my God, you will not believe what’s happened.’ Then I’ve got to do the 1pm news. And all the headlines have changed, which is good.

3/29/2022,"When Encanto was announced the winner of the Oscar for best animated film on Sunday night, Martín Anzellini – the Colombian architect who helped develop the film’s representation of his home country – had little idea. Instead, he was watching Encanto at home with his twin toddler daughters, who had yet to see it. “Once we finished watching the film, I checked my phone and saw my WhatsApp was going wow!” Anzellini said. “It was so exciting, I almost cried. And I hugged my daughters, as my work on the film was for them.” Though Anzellini may have been slow on the uptake, much of his country was united in celebration of the film’s success for breaking Colombia’s usual association with drugs and violence. “For Colombians it’s important to see ourselves represented in a positive light, given that we’re so used to being about cocaine and war,” said Anzellini, who teaches at the Javeriana University in Bogotá. “The most important thing with a film like this is that we can see ourselves differently.” Though the whimsical blockbuster was made by American directors and producers, the story it tells of the magical Madrigal family is steeped in Colombian folklore. The film-makers worked with a number of Colombian consultants on the film across various disciplines, from architects and anthropologists to animators. The film also alludes to the country’s history of violence and forced displacement, and while themes of intergenerational trauma may not seem like a recipe for box-office success, they reverberated intensely in Colombia, which has been racked by decades of civil war between the state, leftist rebel armies, rightwing paramilitaries, and drug traffickers. Over 260,000 people were killed in the conflict that formally ended with a fragile 2016 peace deal, while millions were forced to abandon their homes. Children were often at risk of recruitment into violent groups or growing up as orphans. “Unfortunately, conflict is a recurring theme in Colombia, but if we don’t acknowledge those wounds, then we’ll keep on repeating them,” said Alejandra Espinoza, a writer and researcher who consulted with the filmmakers on the film’s representation of Colombia’s history. “The film takes place in a small town because violence in Colombia was historically in small towns, before people were displaced to the big cities.” The film also leans heavily on the imagery of Nobel Prize-winning Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez, popularly known as Gabo. “Gabo once told me that ‘all of my work comes from the popular culture of Colombia’s Caribbean coast’,” said Jaime Abello Banfi, who heads the Gabo Foundation in Cartagena. “And while Encanto isn’t an adaptation, it’s clear that [songwriter] Lin-Manuel Miranda and his team were very keen to base it on Colombian magical realism.” “Magical realism has become a whole theme that marks our country,” he said. Colombian singer Sebastián Yatra performed a song from the film during Sunday’s ceremony, in a suit embroidered with a flutter of yellow butterflies, much like those that follow one of the characters in Márquez’s masterpiece One Hundred Years of Solitude. “As a Colombian in a globalized world, watching the Oscars, it was always something far away,” said Hernando Bahamon, a Colombian animator who consulted on the film. “It was something to see everyone mentioning Colombia on Sunday night.” In a country where the often faltering national football team is the usually the only institution that unites the divided population, the film’s win brought out praise from across society and the political spectrum. “Encanto, inspired by the cultural richness of our country, fills us with pride,” tweeted rightwing president Iván Duque on Sunday night, while Gustavo Petro, the leftwing frontrunner in upcoming elections, was similarly effusive. “I love that Encanto won an Oscar,” Petro, a former guerrilla fighter turned firebrand politician, tweeted. “Now the magic begins.”",News/World news,Not just ‘cocaine and war’: Colombian pride at Oscar-winning Encanto’s positive portrayal,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/colombia-encanto-oscars-animated-film
3/29/2022,"When Senator Joe Manchin announced in December that he would not support the Build Back Better Act, House progressives immediately got to work. As the Congressional Progressive Caucus continued to lobby for passing a social spending package, its members also started crafting a list of potential executive orders that Biden could sign to advance Democrats’ policy agenda. That list was released in mid-March after months of deliberations, and it outlines a specific strategy for Biden to combat the climate crisis and lower costs for American families with the flick of his pen. The suggestions from the CPC demonstrate the increasing pressure that Biden faces from progressive Democrats to take more decisive action before the midterm elections in November, where many in his party fear they could get badly beaten. Progressives warn that, if Biden does not start signing more executive orders, Democrats’ failure to follow through on many of their campaign promises will result in severely depressed voter turnout among their supporters in November, probably allowing Republicans to regain control of the House and the Senate. If such a thing were to happen, it would represent a perhaps crippling blow to Biden’s first term and cement an unlikely recovery for a Republican party still beholden to its Trumpist base and where Donald Trump himself is considering a 2024 White House campaign. The CPC’s list of possible orders addresses everything from the climate crisis to immigration reform and healthcare costs, covering a broad array of issues that affect a large swath of the Democratic coalition. The suggestions include expanding Affordable Care Act insurance coverage for 5.1 million families and lowering the costs of essential drugs like insulin. To help families’ budgets, the CPC is also calling for canceling federal student loan debt and expanding eligibility for overtime pay. On the issue of the climate crisis, the list includes an order to declare a national climate emergency and reinstate a ban on US crude oil exports. “We have made important and significant progress as Democrats in the first year of the Biden presidency,” the CPC chair, Pramila Jayapal, said. “But our work is far from done. We have an ambitious agenda, and we want to make sure we continue building on this progress.” The CPC is not alone in turning its attention to the power of the executive pen, as other progressive elements of the Democratic party urge decisive action from Biden. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus have held meetings recently to discuss executive orders Biden could sign to advance voting rights and criminal justice reform. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus also expects to soon release its own suggestions for executive orders aimed at reforming the US immigration system, and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus is similarly working on a letter to the White House about advancing its policy priorities. Progressive groups have been vocal advocates for Biden expanding his use of executive orders. Dozens of grassroots organizations consulted with the CPC as it crafted its list, and those groups have underscored the urgency of Biden signing the suggested orders, particularly as Democrats look ahead to the midterms. “I think young people came out in record numbers in 2020 because they felt that Democrats promised an alternative to what we’ve lived through our entire lives. We’re burdened by a planet in a state of emergency; we are burdened by crushing student loan debt,” said John Paul Mejia, chief spokesperson for the climate group Sunrise Movement, which worked with the CPC. Mejia argued that the executive orders represent Democrats’ best opportunity to motivate young voters enough to show up in November. “If young people want to be mobilized and energized and instilled with any form of inspiration to go out to the polls, I think President Biden’s going to really have to take executive action and deliver as much as he can as fast as he can,” Mejia said. The White House seems to be listening to progressives’ warnings. The Intercept reported on Thursday that the Biden administration is drafting an executive order to bolster manufacturing of clean energy technologies, a suggestion that was included in the CPC’s list. Despite the recent focus on executive action, progressives are careful to emphasize that they are not giving up on legislative efforts to enact Biden’s agenda. Carol Joyner, director of the labor project for working families at Family Values @ Work, said the CPC list was “very strong” but not a substitute for passing some version of the Build Back Better Act. After all, some crucial portions of the original $1.7tn spending package – including the expanded child tax credit and a national paid leave program – almost certainly cannot be enacted via executive action. “This is a fair start, and it reflects the limitations of what you can do and accomplish under executive order. However, we do know that the care infrastructure needs to be established and expanded in this country in order to support working people,” Joyner said. “That type of legislation is what’s going to have a more profound impact on everyone.” Senate Democrats continue to hold hearings on specific portions of Biden’s Build Back Better agenda, with the hope of crafting a new version of the bill that can attract Manchin’s support. In the past week alone, Senate committees have held hearings on lowering childcare costs, increasing homecare services to seniors and investing in clean energy. Manchin has also restarted negotiations with fellow Democrats with the climate portions of the Build Back Better Act, according to the Washington Post. “I feel cautiously optimistic,” Mejia said of the possibility of getting a spending package passed. “It would be stupid for Democrats not to pass climate provisions of Build Back Better at a time when they not only face the urgent timeline of a climate emergency, but also when young people are losing hope in the party.” But progressives have been burned by Manchin before, which is why they say Biden needs to pursue a two-prong strategy of signing executive orders while simultaneously trying to advance legislation. “I’m proud of us for pivoting but also being able to keep both tracks moving around a legislative solution and executive action solution,” said Natalia Salgado, director of federal affairs for the Working Families party. “The progressive movement in general is made up of a lot of organizers. And if you’re an organizer, one of the main lessons you learn at the beginning of your career is that there’s a couple ways to skin a cat.” One of the downsides of relying on executive orders is that they can be easily reversed whenever Republicans regain control of the White House. In the 14 months since he took office, Biden has already signed 85 executive orders. Many of them reversed Donald Trump’s policies on immigration, the climate crisis and the coronavirus pandemic. A future Republican president could do the same. But progressives remain convinced that executive orders are one of Biden’s best options to deliver immediate relief to the young Americans, women and people of color who helped get him elected. “I don’t think we should be concerned about what happens down the road. Right now, President Biden has the pen,” Joyner said. “And if he can pass executive orders that support working people and help create jobs and help to rebuild our economy and make it stronger and more equitable, then he should do it.”",News/US news,Progressives push Biden to act with Democrats’ midterm hopes in balance,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/29/democrats-progressives-biden-execuitve-orders-midterms
3/29/2022,"America’s relationship with guns will probably never be peaceful, but as a rash of new pro-gun laws spread across the country some fear it could soon be legal in as many as 25 US states to carry a concealed gun without a permit. To gun control advocates and law enforcement it’s a dangerous new development in America’s enduring, historic and highly politicized infatuation with personal firearms. To gun ownership supporters, it’s a rational response to threats to the second amendment that force law-abiding citizens to undergo police fingerprinting and background checks. Over the past month, Georgia, Ohio and Indiana have moved to abolish requirements for a background check and license to carry a handgun in public. Last year, six states – Arkansas, Iowa, Montana, Tennessee, Texas and Utah – enacted permit-less carry measures, according to the Pew Research Center. Many others are expected to follow as gun rights groups – often politically conservative – push similar plans. Called “constitutional carry” or “permitless carry” by gun rights supporters, permit repeals are a totem in red states offering Republican candidates facing primary season and November elections an opportunity to burnish far-right credentials. But the bills have been criticized by police and gun control advocates, who argue that removing permits poses a safety risk to citizens and law enforcement officers. “There’s a reason law enforcement officers overwhelmingly oppose permitless carry: it makes their jobs harder and puts their lives – and the lives of the people they’re sworn to protect – on the line,” said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action. “When states dismantle permitting systems and gut gun safety laws, gun violence goes up. Gun lobby-backed politicians are shamefully putting primary politics over public safety, and the consequences will be even more devastation for their constituents and the law enforcement officers they pretend they support.” But the momentum toward permitless is unmistakable, as new laws give millions of Americans increasingly unfettered access to firearms even as gun violence rises across the country. Texas went permitless in June when governor Greg Abbott, National Rifle Association boss Wayne LaPierre, and others gathered at the Alamo for a bill signing. “Government is coming to take your guns,” Abbott warned. “Texas will not let that happen.” The measures have received a complicated response. If they are, as some have suggested, a political counter response to progressive-left calls to defund the police, they may inadvertently achieve that. In Alabama, where legislation dropping legal penalties for carrying concealed firearms without a permit passed in the lower house on a 65-37 vote, the Alabama Sheriff’s Association and others complained that removing the permit requirement would also deprive police departments of revenue from permit purchases, typically about $75. Indiana’s measure will allow anyone 18 or older to carry a handgun in public, unless they have a felony conviction, are facing a restraining order from a court or have a dangerous mental illness. Indiana’s state police superintendent, Doug Carter, said that approval of the measure, which will take effect 1 July, “does not support law enforcement, period”. But the Republican governor, Eric Holcomb, said the permit repeal bill “entrusts Hoosiers who can lawfully carry a handgun to responsibly do so within our state”. In Georgia, the Republican governor, Brian Kemp, also facing election this year, has argued that residents should have their rights protected – and be able to protect themselves and their families amid a spike in violent crime. Others in the party have cited civil unrest seen in a few 2020 protests over racial injustice in Atlanta. “This bill gets the government out of our way and allows us to do what we need to do in these precarious times,” said state politician Mandi Ballinger, the Republican sponsor of the Georgia bill. David Yamane, author of Concealed Carry Revolution: Liberalizing the Right to Bear Arms in America, said the recent sweep of state-level gun liberalization follows a long trend. “From the early 1800s to the 1980s, the concealed carry of firearms was restricted because people thought nothing good comes of people carrying guns hidden on their person,” he said. After that time, states started to loosen their laws, first passing laws saying license issuing authority “may issue” licenses, which gives the authority discretion, then moving to “shall issue”, meaning the state does not have discretion and anyone who meets statutory requirements will be issued a permit, then to “permitless carry.” The shift toward unlimited or “permitless carry” started in Vermont and followed a track through Alaska and Arizona. “It’s really picked up steam in the last decade with the progression of the idea to make it easier for people to carry concealed firearms without restrictions,” said Yamane. But Yamane cautions that “permitless carry” does not mean there’s no background check – only if you have a legal right to bear a firearm can you carry concealed in public. “It’s not throwing out all restrictions. You still can’t carry in federal buildings or on school property, and you still need to pass a criminal background check,” he said. To Josh Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition To Stop Gun Violence, the legislation necessarily means that the more guns in public, the more dangerous it is for people. “The data shows that the relaxation of permitless carry laws has led to more gun violence and there’s no evidence of any protective factor. And remember every data point we look at is someone deceased,” he said. According to the CDC, more Americans died of gun-related injuries in 2020 than in any other year on record – 45,222. That figure includes a record number of gun murders, as well as a near-record number of gun suicides, which make up 54% of the total. Despite the increase in fatalities, the rate of gun deaths – a statistic that accounts for the nation’s growing population – remains below the levels of previous years. The figures do not necessarily do justice to the politics of the issue, in part because the effect of loosened gun laws are not immediately apparent. But the momentum is clear: in New York “may-issue” laws are being challenged in supreme court, while state-level legislatures are pulsing with multiple challenges to guns restrictions, from Stand Your Ground – the right to self-defense – to permitless carry and red flag laws. And the political context, says Horwitz, is unmistakable. “These laws are a signal from Republican legislatures to say, ‘I’m Trumpian, I’m as far-right as I can go.’ There was a time when many people in the Republican party were supportive of gun rights but they wanted them regulated. That’s gone out the window.”",News/US news,‘Politics over safety’: the pro-gun laws giving Americans easier access to firearms,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/29/us-constitutional-permitless-carry-gun-laws
3/29/2022,"Australians will be showered with $8.6bn in one-off cash payments and temporary cuts to petrol and income taxes designed to lower the cost of living. In Tuesday’s budget the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, revealed the low and middle income tax offset would be boosted this year by $420 to a maximum tax refund of $1,500 for individuals. Frydenberg confirmed that petrol excise would be halved for six months and welfare recipients and seniors would receive one-off payments of $250, which would be delivered in April. The measures are designed to offset rising costs of living, with inflation running at 3.5% in the December quarter and petrol prices rising to as much as $2.20 a litre due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ahead of the budget, Labor signalled it intended to support cost-of-living measures but criticised the timing of the giveaways before the May election, which economists have warned will add to inflationary pressure and increase the likelihood of interest rate rises. At a cost of $4.1bn, the budget boosts the low and middle income tax offset, adding up to $420 to current recipients’ tax deduction for 2021-22. The measure benefits 10 million people earning up to $126,000, all of who get the $420 boost except those earning less than $25,000 who don’t require the full offset to reduce their tax liability to zero. Some 4.8 million people earning between $48,000 and $90,000 will receive the maximum tax refund of $1,500. The tax refund tapers down to $420 for those earning up to $126,000. From midnight on Tuesday the petrol excise will halve from 44.2 cents a litre of petrol or diesel to 22.1 cents, at a net cost of $3bn to the budget. In his speech, Frydenberg said the measure would “flow through to the bowser over the next two weeks” and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission “will monitor retailers to make sure these savings are passed on in full”. The petrol excise cut would save a family with two cars who fill up once a week “around $30 a week” or $700 across six months, he said. The fuel tax relief expires automatically after six months, on 28 September. At a cost of $1.5bn the government will provide one-off $250 economic support payments to six million people including pensioners, disability support recipients, parenting payment recipients, carers, jobseekers, veterans, eligible self-funded retirees and concession card holders including seniors card holders. In his speech, Frydenberg said the Coalition would repair the budget by “ending economy-wide emergency support” while Labor’s policies would “result in higher taxes and higher interest rates”. But Frydenberg said the Morrison government was prepared to tackle “​​higher fuel, food and shipping costs” with a “temporary, targeted and responsible cost of living package”. In a budget with many front-loaded and temporary payments, paid parental leave will receive a permanent boost. Parents will be able to claim a total of 20 weeks leave, to be shared between them as they see fit, instead of 18 weeks for the primary carer and two for the other parent. Single parents will be eligible for the full 20 weeks for the first time. The measure will cost $346m over five years, including to raise the household income threshold to $350,000 per year. “Families, not government, are best placed to decide what works for them,” Frydenberg said. “We will expand eligibility and provide working families with full flexibility and greater choice.” Earlier on Tuesday the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said “there’s a need for cost-of-living relief” – but on a “permanent basis”. Albanese told ABC Radio National that Labor had been “constructive” in opposition and “never let the perfect be the enemy of the good” – signalling it was likely to support all cost-of-living measures in the budget. “So if there are measures which give people money, for example, one-off payments, now, we’re unlikely to say, ‘No, don’t give people a one-off payment’. “But I’ll tell you what. We’ll point out that it’s probably timed for the election. What we need is a plan for the economy, not a plan to get the Coalition a fourth term in office.” The low and middle income tax offset has been criticised as a form of middle class welfare which benefits people earning in excess of the median employee income in Australia of $62,400. The $420 LMITO boost means a worker earning the median income will receive a 0.7% tax cut this year, but if the offset is not extended beyond 2021-22, will receive a 2.5% tax increase next year. In March the Deloitte Access budget monitor noted the LMITO flowed “disproportionally to higher-income households” because it flowed to “low- to middle-income taxpayers”, when in fact almost half of adult Australians don’t pay income tax. “Australia’s economy is well past the point at which additional stimulus is needed,” it said, warning that further income tax cuts could prompt the Reserve Bank of Australia to lift rates sooner. Deloitte also argued against petrol excise cuts, which it said was “not good policy” because excise “only accounts for one-fifth of the price at the pump”. “That’s just not a big enough lever: you can’t fix the impact of a war in Europe by using a band-aid on a tax in Australia.” The budget estimates that inflation will ease from 4.25% in 2021-22 to 3% in 2022-23, which Frydenberg told reporters factored in a 0.25% cut in inflation from the petrol excise measure.",News/Australia news,Petrol and tax cuts: budget showers voters with $8.6bn in one-off payments and sweeteners ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/australia-federal-budget-2022-cost-of-living-petrol-fuel-excise-income-tax-parental-leave-one-off-payments-temporary-cuts
3/29/2022,"Who hasn’t occasionally wished Hamlet was a bit shorter? As we take our seats for this interval-free, 65-minute version for young audiences, eight-year-old Hilda is amazed it can be three times as long. This is the first Shakespeare play we’ve seen together, though she knows A Midsummer Night’s Dream from CBeebies and recently read the book To Wee or Not to Wee, which has supplied some key details. “Hamlet’s a student,” she says. “His dad’s murdered, there’s going to be a war and there’s a ghost. Then some more stuff happens.” Jude Christian’s adaptation, directed by Tinuke Craig, turns out to be the stuff that dreams are made on. It’s funny, shocking, suspenseful and moving, with convincing central relationships – not always the case with Hamlet. Frankie Bradshaw’s stylish design has a chessboard stage, a geometric grid of lights above and a green-and-gold colour scheme that weirdly matches the school uniforms in the stalls. Most importantly the young audience is drawn right inside the story. This isn’t just through the actors’ opening crowd work or the way the kids create sound effects and chant “mur-der-er!” before the play-within-the-play. It’s because, from the opening funeral scene, the emotional bonds are so keenly felt. At the cortege for Old Hamlet, the wreath spells out “King” but Kiren Kebaili-Dwyer, as Hamlet, clutches another that says “Dad”. His disorientation amid mourning is sustained throughout. Hamlet’s horror at his mother’s remarriage is heightened by making him not just an onlooker at Claudius’s proposal, flinching as they kiss, but also a guest at the wedding party, even forced to lead the conga. There is a canny economy in characterisation during that party: Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are comical MCs and it’s not just Vedi Roy’s killer moves on the dance floor that mark his Claudius out as dangerous. “Think of me as of a father,” he tells Hamlet, a heavy emphasis on “me” highlighting vanity and power. Later, Hilda finds it hilarious that this super-villain is himself cast as the baddy in The Murder of Gonzago. Understanding the strength of sibling relationships within a young audience, Christian focuses on Ophelia (Jessica Alade) and Laertes (Chanel Waddock) who become sisters in this version. They conspiratorially mock Polonius (David Ahmad in recognisable “embarrassing dad” mode), anticipating his advice before he gives it. Hilda wonders which sibling is older. I’ve never considered this but it’s a sign that she is putting herself in their shoes and also comparing this sisterly relationship to her own. Young or old, audiences need to believe in Hamlet and Ophelia’s romance. The lines from his love letters are set to music here: Ophelia sings his words, just as she later speaks some of his soliloquies. It makes this a shared tragedy, echoed in the eventual appearance of the ghost (a bewitching bit of puppetry requiring four performers) and a simple yet striking veil motif that unites each character upon death. The adaptation calls on children’s particular sense of moral indignation, especially in friendship betrayals and inconsistent behaviour from grownups. Hilda fumes at the disparity between Claudius and Gertrude: “How come he wears the cape and fancy stuff and she only has a crown?” A subtle parallel develops between the young audience’s innocence and Ophelia’s purity. Shakespeare is customarily diluted for children so I wonder if they’ll obscure some of the killings. Far from it: Hilda is shocked when Polonius dies and asks if Hamlet will go to jail. Plots become so familiar to us but there is a gasp from the row in front as a boy asks in disbelief – spoiler alert – “Are they all dead?!” And Laertes’s despair seems overwhelming when Hilda says sadly: “Her father’s died and her sister’s drowned.” When the hour is up, the play feels new to both of us.

3/29/2022,"Small businesses that spend on new technologies and training courses to upskill staff will be able to claim 120% of the costs as deductions, as part of budget measures that will cost the government $1.6bn in tax revenue. For the estimated 3.6m businesses with an annual turnover of less than $50m, eligible costs incurred from Tuesday evening can be deducted from their taxable revenue at an amount greater than what was actually spent. The budget also includes several other initiatives for small businesses, including $4.6m over two years for free Beyond Blue mental health support for entrepreneurs. The Fair Work Commission will also be given $5.6m over four years to establish a dedicated unit for dealing with unfair dismissals and industrial protection disputes for small businesses. The Technology Investment Boost allows businesses to claim the bonus 20% deduction for the cost of expenses and depreciating assets, such as portable payment devices, cybersecurity systems and subscriptions to cloud-based services. An annual cap of $100,000 will apply to eligible technology expenditure, with the initiative set to last until 30 June 2023. In his budget speech, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said he hoped the technology scheme would encourage small businesses “that are embracing the digital revolution” by rewarding those that invest in new technologies. “From tonight, every hundred dollars these small businesses spend on digital technologies like cloud computing, e-invoicing, cybersecurity and web design will see them get a $120 tax deduction,” Frydenberg said. The Skills and Training Boost will also cover spending incurred by eligible businesses from Tuesday, and will last until 30 June 2024. There is no limit on how much spending on training courses can be deducted by a small business at the bonus rate of 120%, but certain rules apply, such as that the course must be run by an external education provider, which needs to be registered in Australia. In-house and on-the-job training is not eligible, nor is money spent training people who are not employees of the business. The courses can be provided in person (only in Australia) or online. Frydenberg said the skills initiative was designed to help small businesses “become more productive and competitive”. “No one knows better than a small business owner what skills they need in their employees,” he said. The Technology Investment Boost is budgeted to cost $1bn in forgone tax revenue over the life of the scheme, while the Skills and Training Boost will similarly reduce tax revenue by $550m. Frydenberg claimed his government had helped small businesses more than any other, with the lowest tax rates in 50 years. “Small and family businesses are at the heart of our economy and local communities,” he said. “Lower taxes for small business is part of our plan for a stronger future.”",News/Australia news,Small businesses offered bonus tax deductions on technology and training in federal budget,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/australia-federal-budget-2022-small-business-technology-training-boost
3/29/2022,"Australia’s electronic spy agency will double in size and ramp up its ability to launch its own offensive cyber operations as part of a $10bn national security budget pledge curiously dubbed Redspice. But the funding is spread over 10 years and only $4.2bn will be spent in the first four-year budget cycle. Given the government is partly offsetting the package with savings from other parts of the defence portfolio, the cyber pledge is worth only $588.7m in new money in the first four years. The money would allow the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) to “keep pace with the rapid growth of cyber capabilities of potential adversaries”, the government said. In a separate move, the government has budgeted an extra $1.2bn between now and the late 2030s towards a national space mission for Earth observation, “which will see Australia design, build, and operate four new satellites”. While the cyber package reflects advice from security agencies about the increasing threats of attacks on critical infrastructure, it also fits the Coalition’s political desire to make national security a key issue in the looming election. In a move that will do nothing to diminish criticism of prime minister Scott Morrison as being unduly focused on marketing, the government has created a buzzword for the initiative, Redspice – “Resilience, Effects, Defence, Space, Intelligence, Cyber and Enablers”. Under the package, the ASD is expected to add 1,900 jobs over the decade, including data analysts, computer programmers and software engineers. The government said it would bolster Australia’s commitment to its Five-Eyes and Aukus partners “while supporting a secure Indo-Pacific region”. While ASD on the whole will double in size, it is expected to triple its offensive cyber capabilities. The agency will also bolster its efforts to fend off cyber-attacks on Australia’s critical infrastructure, “being able to counter attack and protect our most critical systems”, according to Tuesday’s budget papers. It will aim to “anticipate and deter a crisis and deliver asymmetric capabilities”. Budget papers revealed the cost of Redspice would be partially offset by savings in the Defence Integrated Investment Program, but those specific cuts were not immediately clear. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told parliament it was “the biggest ever investment in Australia’s cyber preparedness” and the lesson of history was that “weakness invites aggression”. He said the world faced “uncertain times” – a message the government is increasingly amplifying as it warns voters against risking a change of government in May. “Tonight, as we gather, war rages in Europe,” Frydenberg said. He used his budget speech to launch a political attack on Labor, saying “those opposite allowed defence spending to fall to its lowest level since 1938”. The Gillard Labor government did outline defence cuts in the 2012 budget while under political pressure to deliver a promised surplus, but then used its 2013 defence white paper to reinstate a commitment to spend at least 2% of GDP on defence each year. In the lead-up to this year’s election, Labor leader Anthony Albanese has offered bipartisan support to the 2% minimum and has said big national security, defence and strategic issues are above politics. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Coalition has previously faced accusations of talking tough on cybersecurity but failing to deliver. The Australian National Audit Office found last year that just a quarter of Australian government entities were compliant with the mandatory strategies to protect themselves against cyber threats. After the establishment last week of a space command within the Royal Australian Air Force, the government is also pledging more funding to develop Australia’s space industry, to be led by the Australian Space Agency. The minister for science and technology, Melissa Price, said the government wanted “more expertise and more jobs right here in Australia in this critical industry”. “Developing and launching these first four Australian satellites will create the foundation of industry knowhow for more complex space missions next decade,” Price said. The budget does not update the projected cost of Australia’s planned new nuclear-propelled submarines, which are subject to a joint study with the US and the UK. Aukus is mentioned as a “fiscal risk” in the budget papers, because the costs of the acquisition are yet to be assessed. Nor does the budget outline the projected cost of cancelling the contract with French firm Naval Group. But the government wants to secure additional land in Adelaide to build a construction yard for nuclear-powered submarines adjacent to the existing Osborne North shipyard. It also reiterated that its plan to build a new submarine base on the east coast of Australia would be part of an estimated $10bn long-term investment in future submarine infrastructure. Earlier this month the government announced plans to recruit an extra 18,500 defence personnel by 2040 at a total cost of $38bn. The budget also confirms the $156.5m cost of Australia’s support to Ukraine following its invasion by Russia in February, including $91m in “lethal and non-lethal military assistance”. Against the backdrop of heightened concern in Canberra about a planned defence agreement between China and Solomon Islands, the government said it was delivering a record $1.85bn in Official Development Assistance (ODA) to the Pacific this year. Solomon Islands will gain $161.1m in ODA in 2022-23, up from $156.4m this year. The government also continues to pledge “temporary and targeted” additional funding to help the Pacific respond to Covid. The government said it would spend $65m building and maintaining a new complex for the Australian high commission in Honiara in Solomon Islands. The government is ending the freeze on indexation of Australia’s overall ODA levels, meaning it will increase from $4bn in 2021-22 to $4.089bn in 2022-23. In a sign of concerns about the personal safety of MPs and senators, the budget also includes $30m over four years to increase security at Parliament House in Canberra. That includes improving CCTV, upgrading screening equipment and expanding the security operations room.",News/Australia news,Redspice: budget ushers in Australia’s ‘biggest ever’ cybersecurity spend,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/redspice-budget-ushers-in-australias-biggest-ever-cybersecurity-spend
3/29/2022,"On the climate crisis and the natural environment, the story of the 2022-23 budget is one of what isn’t there as much as what is. Armed with scientific warnings about the need for all countries to rapidly scale up action to keep alive the chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the Morrison government plans to cut climate spending if returned to power at the election. The 2022-23 budget papers show it is expected to fall from $2bn next financial year to $1.9bn, $1.5bn and $1.3bn in the three years that follow. The fall represents a 35% annual cut over four years. The figures are spelled out in a section of the papers added under the former prime minister Tony Abbott, who wanted people to be able to see how much total climate spending – which he opposed – was contributing to government debt. The diminishing sum is for spending across clean energy agencies expected to do the heavy lifting under the Coalition’s much-vaunted “technology, not taxes” approach to emissions reduction and other climate programs. It includes funding to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena), the “direct action” emissions reduction fund, programs to develop a “clean” hydrogen industry and resilience programs to protect the Great Barrier Reef, which is currently suffering through its fourth mass bleaching event in six years. The cut may in part be due to a recent decision by Angus Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, to allow businesses to break contracts to sell carbon credits to the government under the emissions reduction fund so they can instead sell them on the more lucrative private, voluntary market. The budget papers say this will contribute to a $2bn improvement in the budget bottom line over the next four years. That additional cash has not been redirected into other climate programs. The government says it is spending $22bn on low-emissions technology, but that commitment is over a period beyond the life of most governments – about a decade. Most, but not all, of that funding has been promised to top up funding for the CEFC and Arena, which were created a decade ago under a deal between Labor, the Greens and independents. The Coalition initially tried to abolish them. More recently it has embraced them and tried to broaden their role to also fund gas power, “clean” hydrogen made with gas and carbon capture and storage, but been blocked in parliament. Taylor says the budget includes $1.3bn of spending on energy and emissions reduction, not all of it to be spent over the next four years. It focuses on hydrogen and includes projects that will add to the greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. There is $300m to support new liquefied natural gas and “clean” hydrogen production in Darwin, another $247m to help companies investing in low-emissions technologies including hydrogen and $50.3m for gas infrastructure. The latter was announced by Taylor earlier this month as part of the Coalition’s promised “gas-fired recovery”. Oddly, given the government’s zeal for gas as an energy source, it did not rate a mention in Josh Frydenberg’s budget speech. He did mention another commitment that was consistent with the budget’s focus on regional Australia: $148.6m for community solar and wind microgrids in areas too remote to have access to the power grid. On the natural environment, there was little beyond what had already been flagged. It included $1bn for the reef spread over nine years, mostly to help clean up agricultural run-off affecting water quality, and $804m for Antarctic research and strategic capability over a decade. They read like big sums, and the Antarctic funding has been applauded, but the reef money in particular is diluted by the extended timeframe – it is really just a continuation of existing funding and, experts say, a fraction of what is required. As the government acknowledges, the climate crisis remains the biggest threat facing the 2,300km reef system. The government also announced $636.4m over six years to boost the number of indigenous rangers working on land and sea management by up to 1,089, though most of the funding was not due until after 2025. Sussan Ley, the environment minister, pledged $60m for plastic recycling, a $100m extension of an existing community-focused environment restoration fund and $128.5m as part of its promise to change how the environmental impact of development proposals are assessed. The latter, also announced earlier this month, includes a commitment to set up “bioregional plans” so projects in nominated areas do not need individual federal assessments. Little detail has been released. It is possible it could help address a major flaw with the current system – its failure to factor in the cumulative impact of different projects that destroy habitat and affect threatened species and ecosystems. But conservation groups are concerned it could further water down Australia’s environment protection laws, which everyone agrees are failing. A once-a-decade government review by the former competition watchdog Graeme Samuel last year found Australia was on a “trajectory of environmental decline”. The bottom line is there is nothing in this budget on the scale needed to start to address that.

3/29/2022,"The opening flourishes of Josh Frydenberg’s budget night speech certainly convey the gravity of our times. “Tonight, as we gather, war rages in Europe,” the treasurer told parliament. “The global pandemic is not over. Devastating floods have battered our communities.” “We live in uncertain times.” Indeed, we do. But if we move from Frydenberg’s rhetoric to content, we discover this budget isn’t a serious plan for the future crafted by serious people in serious times. This is a plan for the next few months. This is a budget with one central objective: the re-election of the Morrison government in May. With wages stagnant and consumer prices on the march, the Coalition’s primary pre-election gift to voters is cash for Australia’s low-and-middle income earners. As well as cash, the government will cut the fuel excise in half in the hope a price cut at the bowser isn’t swallowed immediately by another adverse shift in the global oil price or an interest rate rise between now and September, when the excise is supposed to revert to its full rate. This “temporary” assistance assumes there is some future benign political universe where either the current government, or a newly elected Labor one, can give Australians relief at the petrol pump, then take it away without incurring massive political pain – which has to be the working definition of the triumph of hope over experience. Let’s believe the fuel excise reversion when we see it. And the cost of “please like me”? More than $8bn over the next two years. The treasurer and the finance minister will say the following in their defence: most of the pre-election cash splash in this budget washes through. The spending isn’t baked in and much of the revenue uplift from Australia’s burgeoning post-pandemic economic recovery has been banked rather than spent. Both of these observations are true. Also true: had the Coalition done nothing in this budget to ease escalating cost-of-living pressures, they would have been belted politically. The government insists its cash splash won’t feed inflationary pressures, which is obviously a significant risk to manage. But a pre-election handout north of $8bn is still a hefty price tag, however you look, however you measure. Speaking of hefty price tags, this budget also finally squares the accounts between Scott Morrison, a prime minister who last year needed to land a commitment to net zero emissions by 2050, and Barnaby Joyce, a Nationals leader who wasn’t inclined to sign up unless the terms were favourable. For graciously declining to humiliate Morrison at the Glasgow climate summit last year, Joyce has been rewarded with “transformational investments” (read many, many billions) for dams, roads and regional communications infrastructure. “Thank you, Barnaby” includes about $3bn for inland rail, as well as $7.1bn over 11 years to “turbocharge the economies of four regional hubs across Australia”. It’s probably a coincidence (yes, that is irony) that these hubs are located in the Northern Territory (two marginal seats there), north and central Queensland (Labor has its eye particularly on the electorate of Flynn), the Hunter in New South Wales (where the Nationals would very much like to snatch a seat from Labor) and the Pilbara in Western Australia. This regional spend is north of $20bn over the medium term. I think the technical term for that is happy days on the Wombat Trail. Given that this budget is very obviously political, and in Coalition terms, measurably transactional, Frydenberg and Morrison will insist they are about more than surviving an election contest. I feel certain Exhibit A for future focus will be the national security spend – the magnificently named Redspice, which is (to quote the treasurer) “a $9.9bn investment in Australia’s offensive and defensive cyber capabilities” and “the biggest ever investment in Australia’s cyber-preparedness”. The government says this initiative is all about meeting the challenges associated with the darkening geostrategic environment – which is very obviously a serious problem. But take a moment to read the fine print. You’ll discover the investment to deal with this serious problem is loaded largely outside the forward estimates. The budget papers also make clear the expenditure will be “partly offset from the Defence Integrated Investment Program”. In net terms, the outlay on Redspice over the next four years is actually $588.7m, not $9.9bn. Do remember that over the coming weeks, when Peter Dutton breaks out his loudhailer and throws down tests of patriotism out on the hustings. Speaking of loudhailers, the 2022 election contest is now in sight. It could be days away. It could be a couple of weeks away. But it is close enough now to be real. If we cast our minds back to 2007, when Labor was attempting to plot a pathway to government against an ageing Coalition government in whatever-it- takes mode, Kevin Rudd’s cut-through political riposte was “this reckless spending must stop”. Back then, Rudd savaged John Howard’s “irresponsible spending spree” as a “desperate attempt” to buy a fifth term in government. Back then, the Reserve Bank was warning about government spending fuelling inflationary pressures and interest rate rises. Audacious and supremely self-confident, Rudd backed himself to weaponise fiscal profligacy against Howard – to make the trinkets and tricks a symbol of a prime minister who cared more about the present than the future. That effort succeeded. But Anthony Albanese, ahead in the polls, and in small target mode, seems unlikely to adopt the Rudd playbook. Given that Australians are struggling with rising prices – this is probably safe politics. Safe, yes, but not entirely risk free. Given that there is palpable disenchantment out in voter land, and given that the prime minister is working around the clock to convince people to stick with the devil they know in uncertain times, safe politics does raise one question. Will Albanese present as sufficiently different from Morrison to be trusted by voters to chart a new course for Australia?",News/Australia news,At this gravest of times the Coalition has served up an election budget designed simply to keep itself in power | Katharine Murphy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/australia-federal-budget-2022-election-scott-morrison-josh-frydenberg
3/29/2022,"Josh Frydenberg is pegging his government’s re-election chances on a budget cash splash fuelled by a “remarkable” economic rebound, with $8.6bn promised for Australian households, and billions of dollars of new spending for the regions, defence and infrastructure. As the government prepares to kickstart its campaign for a May election within days, Tuesday’s budget includes an extra tax cut for 10 million low and middle income workers worth up to $420, and a $250 one-off cash payment for pensioners and concession card holders aimed at softening the blow of rising inflation. These measures will cost a combined $5.6bn. In addition, the government will also halve the fuel excise for six months – which is now set at 44 cents a litre – saving about $15 on the average price of a tank of petrol, at a cost to the budget of about $3bn. And after the Nationals played hard-ball in last year’s net zero negotiations with the Liberals, the budget has also allocated $7.1bn for a regional development package focused on four regional hubs that cover a swathe of key electorates targeted by the Coalition, along with billions of dollars for the inland rail project and regional roads, telecommunications, health and development. Budget commitments for the regions outlined in the budget total more than $21bn over the medium term. The regional hubs package will see $2.6bn spent on infrastructure in the Northern Territory, $1.7bn in central and northern Queensland, $1.5bn in the Pilbara and $750m in the Hunter region. Frydenberg said the regions were a “priority” for the government, acknowledging that there was “a lot in this budget for the regions”. “It’s part of a deal with the Australian people to deliver more jobs and more growth to the regions,” he said. Riding a wave of increased revenue driven by a tight jobs market, soaring commodity prices and lower-than- expected payments, the government has revised down forecast deficits by $103.6bn over the five years to 2025-26 compared with the midyear budget update. The budget documents show the underlying cash balance has improved $38.1bn in 2022-23, and by $114.6bn over the four years to 2025-26. But while the government has banked most of this to improve the budget bottom line, the total cost of policy decisions is $17.2bn next year and $30.4bn over the four years to 2025-26. Gross debt will move above a trillion dollars in 2023-24, growing to $1.17tn by 2025-26, which is the equivalent of 44.7% of GDP. The finance minister, Simon Birmingham, said the government’s budget management had allowed for the delivery of a dividend back to taxpayers. “But it seeks to apply those dividends in a careful, cautious, responsible way to set Australia up for the future.” The deficit for 2021-22 is expected to be $79.8bn, with total deficits across the four-year forward estimates totalling $224.7bn. At the same time, economic growth forecasts have been upgraded on the back of momentum in the jobs market and buoyant consumer spending, with GDP now forecast to grow by 4.25% in 2021-22, 3.5% in 2022-23 and 2.5% in 2023-24. Since the height of the pandemic, 701,000 Australians have come off unemployment benefits, with an extra 1.2 million people back into work, driving the country’s welfare bill down $11bn over four years. Australia’s unemployment rate will drop to 3.75% in the September quarter this year, its lowest figure in 50 years and three percentage points lower than the 7% doomsday scenario predicted in last year’s budget. As a result of the booming jobs market, the budget says wage growth is on track to accelerate at its fastest pace in almost a decade, with the wage price index to jump from 2.75% this year to 3.25% next year. “Broader and more representative wage measures are picking up more quickly as workers take advantage of the tight labour market, with average earnings per hour expected to increase by 5 per cent through the year to the June quarter of 2022,” budget papers say. Frydenberg said the economic rebound outlined in the budget was “remarkable”, placing Australia ahead of all other major advanced economies. But arguing risks to the economic outlook remain – including the Covid pandemic and the unfolding crisis in Ukraine – the treasurer said “this is not the time to change course” to a Labor government. “This is a time to stick to our plan,” he said. Inflation, which is on track to be 4.25% in the current financial year, is forecast to quickly moderate to 3% next year, followed by 2.75% the following year, providing only a small lift in real wages from 2022-23. The budget papers show that wages grew at less than half the rate of inflation in 2020-21, with prices rising 3.8% and wages falling behind, growing a mere 1.7%. Labor has already cast doubt on the government’s wage growth predictions, pointing to the 52 of 55 forecasts of wage growth that have not eventuated under the Coalition’s watch. And, despite the government forecasting wages growth to accelerate at their fastest rate in a decade, real wages are not likely to recover to 2019 levels until 2025. Frydenberg defended the wage growth forecasts, saying the broader national accounts measure of average earnings, which captured total remuneration including bonuses, overtime and allowances, showed stronger wage rises. Under the cost of living package, the low and middle income tax offset will be increased by $420, meaning all workers earning up to $126,000 a year will receive an extra boost when they lodge their tax return for this year. This will increase the maximum amount to $1,500 for a single income household and $3,000 for a two-income household, with the boost costing the budget an extra $4.1bn. The $250 tax-free cost of living payment will go to 6 million eligible Australian pensioners, welfare recipients, veterans and concession card holders “within weeks”. Frydenberg said the cost of living package was designed to provide temporary and practical help for household budgets to deal with the rising cost of living. “Events abroad are pushing up the cost of living at home,” he said in his budget speech. “Higher fuel, food and shipping costs are increasing inflation and stretching household budgets. “This budget’s new cost of living package is responsible and targeted, delivering cheaper fuel, cheaper medicines and putting more money in the pockets of millions of Australians.” The budget also includes a small business package that will give a tax incentive for investment in skills, training and digital technology, with a tax deduction of $120 for every $100 spent in these areas up to $100,000 a year. A skills package includes $2.8bn for apprentices and $2.2bn for innovation at universities, while an extra $1bn will be spent on the government’s modern manufacturing strategy. The budget papers also lay out the cost of the government’s flood relief and recovery effort for the New South Wales and Queensland floods, which is expected to be more than $6bn, with $3.6bn already spent. An extra $4.7bn is being spent on health services, while an extra $1.3bn will be put towards the delivery of the national plan to end violence against women and children. On defence, the government has massively ramped up spending over the next decade, including a $9.9bn commitment towards cyber – known as Redspice – with about $600m of this allocated over the forward estimates.",News/Australia news,Federal budget 2022: Josh Frydenberg promises cash splash for households with billions on offer,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/australia-federal-budget-2022-election-josh-frydenberg-promises-cash-splash-for-households-with-billions-on-offer
3/29/2022,"Britons are drinking cocktails in record numbers at home and in bars according to drinks group AG Barr, as consumers opt for a pornstar martini or mojito in a trend accelerated during the pandemic. The Scottish company, which makes Irn-Bru, Rubicon and cocktail brand Funkin, said 7.4 million people drink cocktails when they go to a bar, club or restaurant, a 13% increase compared with pre-pandemic levels. About 43% of those cocktail drinkers indulge at least once a week. AG Barr, which reported that its overall business has bounced back above pre-pandemic levels in the year to 30 January, first noticed the cocktail boom last spring as Covid restrictions that kept the hospitality industry shut were lifted. Sales of its mixers jumped more than 60% in the 10 weeks after restrictions were lifted, compared with pre-pandemic. “The cocktail category has performed extremely well, benefiting from increased numbers of consumers returning to venues and increasing levels of participation in the category,” the company said. “Cocktails outperformed other categories.” The company said that the popularity of cocktails has endured, accounting for 9.9% of total venue drink sales between April and 23 October last year, compared with 6% in the same period pre-pandemic. “While the emergence of the Omicron variant towards the end of 2021 led to both the reintroduction of some social restrictions and increased consumer caution over the festive period, the cocktail category remains a significant growth opportunity for the hospitality sector in general,” the company said. The surge in the popularity of drinking cocktails while locked down at home has continued despite the reopening of pubs, bars and clubs. The company said the sale of cocktails for home consumption had risen 44% year-on-year to be worth £92m, of a total ready-to-drink market of £509m. Bestsellers include pornstar martini, mojito, sex on the beach, Long Island iced tea and daiquiri. In February, AG Barr revealed it is increasing its prices after its packaging, ingredients and energy-linked commodity costs jumped, as it raised its sales and profit estimates. On Tuesday, the company reported a 62% increase in pretax profits to £42.2m for the year to 30 January. Revenues rose 18% to £268.8m with the financial performance leading the company to reintroduce its dividend during the year. “Our business and brands have once again proven their resilience in uncertain and often challenging circumstances,” said the AG Barr chief executive, Roger White. “We enter the new financial year with good momentum and exciting brand and sales plans. Trading in the early weeks of the new financial year has been well ahead of the prior year and in line with our expectations.” The drink made global headlines last November when the US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted an Instagram video praising Irn-Bru, after being handed a can by the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, on her arrival in Glasgow for the Cop26 conference.
