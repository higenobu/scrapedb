By the time you read this, we hope to be digging it in on the plot. A wise woman once told me you need cow muck for growing vegetables, but horses are best for blooms. I don’t know what she based this on, but she was reliable on everything else. Maybe it was lockdown that did it. Maybe it was a change in mood or the absence of other gardeners, but there has been a shift on Plot 29 from growing mainly food to tending mainly flowers. This call for colour will continue this year – at least until we know more about the ‘new’ soil and how it responds; what grows well in it. There will, though, be beans and peas as Howard has sorted a new supply of hazel sticks and I’ve succumbed to a Franchi Seeds of Italy (seedsofitaly.com) sale in support of Ukraine. So we’ll have leaves: black kale, swiss chard, lettuces, radicchio and numerous herbs. Plus, our saved amaranth seed and orache; the shoots of flowering fennel. We will grow nasturtiums, of course, and more calendula. I also have two new nesting boxes anxious for a home before it’s too late. I have missed Mary and her sunflowers, her giant wall of runner beans. We’ve stacked some of her sacks and structures on the bank behind the plot. I am pining to bring it back down. There will be working parties and summer barbecues. Fallen trees to trim, new paths and friendships to make. Soon I’ll be sowing and weeding with Howard and Rose. A family of fellow growers.

4/17/2022,"Rupenera Grillo Sicilia Apassimento, Sicily, Italy 2020 (£13.99, virginwines.co.uk) The wine business has spent much of the past couple of decades playing down the role of the winemaker. The idea is that the vigneron is effectively not much more than a chaperone, keeping a watchful eye on the grapes as they make their inevitable passage from juice to wine, but stepping in only when strictly necessary. Much as I applaud the way winemaking has become much more focused on vineyards, and winemakers have grown much less willing to use technical solutions and additives to cover up poor quality grapes, the reality is that winemaking remains a fearsomely complex business filled, like cooking, with thousands of moment-to-moment decisions and variables: from when and how to prune the vines right up to how to stabilise and clarify the wine before bottling. Some interventions are more influential than others, however. Winemaker Mimmo di Gregorio’s decision to leave his grillo grapes to become slightly raisined on the vine before picking, for example, clearly lends his dry white an alluring extra layer of flavour and mouthfilling texture. Marqués de Cáceres Excellens Verdejo, Rueda, Spain 2020 (£11.99, finewinesdirectuk.com) A lot of the grillo planted in Sicily was once used to make the island’s great fortified wine, marsala. It’s only relatively recently that Sicilian winemakers have really begun to explore its potential for fragrant, juicy whites from a variety that is very good at keeping freshening acidity in the heat and sun. Something similar has happened in the Rueda region of Castilla y Leon, in northwestern Spain. Up until the 1970s, Rueda growers were also largely occupied with making sherry-esque fortified wines. It took the rediscovery of an obscure grape variety and the appliance of a particularly precise form of modern winemaking to transform the region into a producer of extravagantly aromatic dry white wines. That technique was based largely on keeping the grapes cool: harvesting at night and fermenting at very low temperatures in spotlessly clean stainless steel tanks, and it’s applied in textbook fashion by Rioja producer Marqúes de Cáceres in their pristine lime-and-tropical fruited, subtly fennel-bitter Excellens. Bosman Adama Fairtrade White, Wellington, South Africa 2020 (£10, The Co-op) Some of the most engaging verdejo comes from winemakers who have looked to move away from the squeaky clean stainless-steel method. Some go in for extended contact between the juice and the lees (the dead yeast cells at the end of fermentation). Others might ferment or age some of the wine in oak barrels or use wild naturally occurring yeasts rather than adding cultivated yeasts. The results – in wines by the likes of Belondrade y Lurton and Barco del Corneta – can be thrilling, with extra density, complexity, creaminess, but retaining verdejo’s natural pungency and ebullience. The decisive effects of winemaking decisions are also very much in evidence in the best white wines of South Africa. Bosman Family Vineyards make some delightful bright, brisk, tangy dry whites from chenin blanc in the low-temperature, stainless steel mode (Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Chenin Blanc; £7.50). But they blend the chenin with grenache blanc and age some of it in new French oak barrels, for the multi-layered, peach and nougat richness of Adama.

4/17/2022,"Three out of four teachers in the UK say class sizes are getting bigger, having a negative impact on pupil progress, levels of attainment and behaviour during lessons, according to a survey. As schools struggle to help pupils catch up amid continuing disruption resulting from the pandemic, more than nine out of 10 (95%) teachers warned that bigger classes were damaging their ability to meet the needs of all pupils. According to a poll of more than 3,000 teachers by the NASUWT teachers’ union, 91% were of the view that class sizes were adversely affecting their pupils’ progress and attainment, while 90% felt they were having a detrimental effect on pupil behaviour. The union, which will debate the issue at its annual conference in Birmingham on Sunday, says class sizes are increasing because of shortages of teachers and increasing numbers of pupils on school rolls. Many teachers are also worried that cramped conditions are fuelling the spread of Covid. Nearly eight out 10 teachers (78%) who took part in the poll said bigger class sizes mean there are not enough learning resources to go round, and of the 75% who reported increased class sizes, more than a third (37%) said numbers had grown “significantly”. NASUWT members will vote on a motion calling for governments and administrations across the UK to introduce maximum class sizes at all key stages of education. Currently, there is no statutory limit on the size of any class above key stage one for pupils aged 5–7 in England and Wales, where classes are limited to 30 or below. One teacher who contributed to the survey said staff shortages in their primary school meant they had been asked to combine their class of 22 with a colleague’s class of 24 when they were absent from work. “The classroom is too small to accommodate 46 pupils at tables. Some have to sit and work on the floor. It is impossible to meet the needs of all pupils, especially [those with] additional learning needs, in this situation without support from a classroom assistant. I and the pupils find the situation stressful,” they said. Another early years teacher said: “I have so many children that most days it’s difficult to fit them all on the carpet. At whole-class learning times, it feels impossible to meet the learning needs of all these children.” According to government data, numbers attending primary and nursery schools peaked in 2019 and since then figures have started to drop. Numbers are however still increasing in secondary schools, where the population is not expected to peak until 2024. Of those who took part in the NASUWT survey, two-thirds (67%) blamed an increase in the number of pupils on roll for growing class sizes, two in five (40%) said it was due to cuts to staff numbers, while the same proportion cited budget cuts or financial pressures. Dr Patrick Roach, NASUWT general secretary, said: “Increases in class size numbers are having a detrimental impact on both the learning experiences of pupils and the health and safety of teachers and students. “This situation once again exposes the failure of government oversight over the last decade in relation to pupil place planning or in guaranteeing the additional investment needed to increase teacher numbers. Children and their teachers deserve better.” A Department for Education spokesperson said 1m additional school places had been created over the past 11 years, the largest increase in school capacity for two generations. “At primary, average class sizes decreased in 2020/21 compared with 2019/20 – the majority of primary schools have 27 pupils or less per class. At secondary school, class sizes remain low, with an average of 22 pupils per class in 2020/21, despite an increase of almost 800,000 pupils in the system since 2010.”",News/Education,"Bigger classes harming pupils’ progress, say 9 in 10 UK teachers",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/17/bigger-classes-harming-pupils-progress-say-9-in-10-uk-teachers
4/17/2022,"We now all know that whatever shade we are, and regardless of whether the sun is beating down or hiding behind ominous clouds, wearing SPF isn’t debatable (factor 30 at least). Right? SPF is the pinnacle of skincare. And, what’s the point of a great makeup look if your skin health is neglected? Using an appropriate broad-spectrum SPF will protect you from harmful UVA and UVB rays that cause burning, wrinkles and cancer. I’m not lecturing. I’m just giving you the facts. Sun damage and hyperpigmentation are a nightmare to reverse, I promise. The most common misconception is that these formulas are greasy, heavy and leave a white cast over the skin. But SPFs have come a long way. They are less visible than ever – unnoticeable if you opt for a bare face and they sit well under makeup, too. Choosing the right product for your skin type is essential. If you have dry skin, pick a sunscreen with hydrating emollients in its formula, like hyaluronic acid or ceramides. Those with oily skin should look for a mineral-based lightweight gel that is non-comedogenic. Just adding this to your skincare regime could save your life (dramatic, I know), but if not, you’ll spend a ton of money on anti-whatever products trying to repair the damage. 1.

4/17/2022,"If, as your editorial suggests, we feel “we are governed by ministers who regard the rules as being for other people” (“Chancellor has damaged faith in democracy”, Comment), it is because they operate with the complacent condescension of Roman patricians, a group that governed by birthright and among whom Boris Johnson behaves like Caesar. It helps to explain what Andrew Rawnsley calls “The stench of entitlement now oozing from Rishi Sunak’s home as well as Mr Johnson’s” (Comment). Rawnsley wonders whether Sunak was “naive, idiotic, complacent, cavalier or arrogant” over his wife’s tax affairs, but once we recognise that Tory ministers think of themselves not as a class but a political caste all becomes clear. Only those who believe that governing is their inherited prerogative could display the indifference, deceit and hypocrisy shown by cabinet ministers over the last two years, to which Mr Sunak has added his sense of outraged privilege. They see no wrong in ringfencing wealth in the midst of massive economic inequality. They are indifferent to criticism unless it might register in a ballot box uncomfortably close to home. They recognise no allegiance to the public they belittle, until it gathers periodically as an electorate.Paul McGilchristColchester, Essex Your view that people in Rishi Sunak’s seat (Richmond, Yorkshire) may forgive his latest errors is interesting but decidedly partial (“Sunak’s stunts and mistakes expose lack of political savvy”, News). Many of his constituents have long noted that our local MP rarely misses an opportunity for self-publicity or situations that lend themselves to his seemingly insatiable need to hone the Rishi brand. Our local weekly paper invariably contains two to three “news” items with photos of the MP. These are reinforced with his occasional personally financed glossy pamphlet. This latter publication has a rare and idiosyncratic style (no doubt confected by his private publicist) of using 30-40 self references to “Rishi” over a couple of sides. Local people are not daft; they recognise spin masquerading as “news”. The burgers of Northallerton may well wish to stay calm but many of us in the wider constituency are tiring of our MP’s incessant thirst for publicity. Indeed, many of us believe he’d do well to adopt the Kingsley Amis posture of believing less equals more.Gus PenningtonStokesley, North Yorkshire Your claim (“Three-quarters of Britons back expansion of wind power”, News) has raised howls of protest in North Devon, where many hills are blighted by the noise and flicker of these giant protrusions. The countryside should not be industrialised in this hideous way. If, instead, every new-build, supermarket, car park, barn, shed and factory were to be compulsorily fitted with solar panels – silent, unobtrusive and comparatively cheap – it would be far better, alongside expanding offshore wind power that, as an island, we have in abundance. We must get to net zero fast, but not by destroying our land and skies.Amanda CraigLifton, Devon You report (“Ministers admit ignoring repeated warnings in the years before Grenfell”, News) that Eric Pickles, Gavin Barwell and Stephen Williams, then government ministers, failed to consider the recommendations of the inquest into the Lakanal House fire. I was the solicitor for the families of the three women and three children who died in that fire. Will the Grenfell Tower inquiry consider stating that an obligation should be placed on government to at least make a reasoned response to recommendations made by coroners on safety to prevent future deaths?Louise ChristianLondon N16 Reading Sonia Sodha on working hours and the value of leisure time (“Covid has shown flexible working is a benefit only for the privileged few”, Comment) had me thinking of anthropologist Marshall Sahlins’s essay, The Original Affluent Society, published more than 50 years ago, in which he demonstrated that for most of history our hunter-gatherer ancestors devoted three hours a day to fulfilling their basic needs, leaving the rest of the time free for social and cultural activities. Other studies indicate that medieval peasants probably enjoyed more leisure time than those of us living in modern industrial societies.Will Douglas-MannPetrockstowe, Devon Given the resurgence of interest in Operation Mincemeat, now both a film and comedy musical (“War legend takes on a new identity for our times”, Focus), it feels important to be precise about the nature of the enterprise and its cultural representation. One of the most remarkable theatre works I have experienced was the 2009 production Mincemeat, by Cardboard Citizens’ Adrian Jackson and Farhana Sheikh. It focused notably on the homeless man – Glyndwr Michael – whose corpse made the venture possible. Despite his pivotal role, he was described by Ewen Montagu, who cooked up the plan, as “a bit of a ne’er-do-well”. History might be written by the victors but it’s important not to forget those whose bodies – literally – made that possible. Fully acknowledging those who came before us would surely make our “finest hour” something to revisit.Gareth Evans, Whitechapel GalleryLondon E8 On behalf of what I suspect are a number of your readers who profess a faith, I welcome Catherine Bennett’s justified criticisms of recent contributions to Thought for the Day Radio 4’s Today programme (“I pray in vain for wisdom amid the platitudes of Thought for the Day”, Comment). A number have been frankly embarrassing and serve only to discredit a faith-based view of the world. Assuming that it has to continue to be broadcast, it is time that it was opened up to contributions from those who espouse a non-religious approach.

4/17/2022,"Last week brought confirmation that Boris Johnson broke laws intended to protect the public during a national emergency. The prime minister and the chancellor are among the group of people who have been fined by the Metropolitan police for attending illegal gatherings in Downing Street, on this occasion to celebrate his birthday. Johnson is expected to receive more fines in the coming weeks. It should be untenable for him to remain in office. First, there is the substance of his misdemeanours. Members of the public made huge sacrifices in order to comply with Covid restrictions during the national lockdowns. People were not able to see their sick relatives, to say goodbye in person one last time or to hold normal-size funerals. Yet the prime minister and his colleagues thought it acceptable to attend numerous parties on the government estate. It makes a mockery of those sacrifices, leaving people feeling not just angry but guilty that they, too, did not break the law in order to be with the dying rather than to attend a birthday party. Then there is the way that the prime minister has handled these revelations in recent months. On numerous occasions, he assured parliament no rules or laws had been broken. The only person to resign in this scandal was his former spokesperson after a video of her joking about a party was leaked; it is not even clear whether she attended any herself. Meanwhile, Johnson has simply brushed off his wrongdoing, with Downing Street sources insulting the intelligence of the public by comparing the fixed-penalty notice to speeding fines. It is unprecedented for a prime minister to be fined by the police for such serious breaches of the law. Every week he remains in office is another week that undermines the public’s trust not just in the government, but in the whole political class. In our parliamentary democracy, Johnson’s immediate fate lies in the hands of MPs in the Conservative party, not in the hands of voters. Only these politicians have the power to eject him from Downing Street through a vote of no confidence, yet it looks highly unlikely they will act. And so Johnson is left free to undermine the office of prime minister long after he should have resigned and to introduce policies designed to dominate newspaper headlines regardless of their consequences. The latest is the memorandum of understanding with Rwanda. This will pave the way for the government to forcibly deport to Rwanda people fleeing conflict and torture who seek refuge in the UK, in exchange for a significant financial contribution to the Rwandan government. The archbishop of Canterbury is right to condemn this in the strongest of terms. One of the richest countries in the world is bribing one of the poorest countries in the world – with its own poor track record of human rights abuses – to outsource our ethical and legal obligations to refugees. Britain gets many fewer applications for asylum than France and Germany, and last year granted protection to 13,000 refugees, the equivalent of just 20 per parliamentary constituency. As a country, we should be doing more, not less, to provide a safe sanctuary to people who have experienced dreadful conflict and human rights abuses in countries such as Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Ukraine. But under the government’s plans, it would aim to deport at great expense to those who arrive in the UK via irregular routes – like many asylum seekers do – to Rwanda, where they would be obliged to apply for asylum. The government argues this would minimise loss of life in the Channel by discouraging people from making the crossing to the UK. Yet the Australian policy of processing asylum seekers offshore on the Pacific island of Nauru did not reduce levels of people smuggling. In fact, when Israel struck a deal to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda between 2014 and 2017, many left Rwanda almost immediately and turned to people smugglers to try and get back to Europe. The lack of any evidence to support the government’s contention this will reduce Channel crossings has resulted in the civil service refusing to sign the policy off on value for money grounds. This has meant that the home secretary, Priti Patel, had to issue a ministerial direction in order to override them, only the second used by a home secretary in 30 years. It also remains to be seen whether this is a policy that would survive challenge in the courts under international law. Either way, this forced deportation scheme marks a new low for British refugee policy, already marred by the inhumane policies in the nationality and borders bill, the government’s failure to offer refuge to all Afghans who worked with British forces before their withdrawal, and the hopeless delays in processing visas for Ukrainian refugees. It would establish a principle that wealthy countries can shrug off obligations to refugees, undermining the very basis of international law and the 1951 Refugee convention. Unless Conservative MPs use their power to sack Johnson, this is what the country is consigned to until the next general election: a prime minister who has flouted the law and misled parliament trying to distract from his own lack of probity by pushing out ever-worse policies that will temporarily grab headlines, regardless of the human cost. They should ask themselves whether they are prepared to be complicit in the long-term damage Johnson is wreaking to their party, to the political system and to the country.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on Boris Johnson’s untenable leadership | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/17/observer-view-on-boris-johnson-untenable-leadership
4/17/2022,"The question I’ve had some short relationships, been on many dates, and had one long-term relationship (a while ago now) where I was dumped on the day before we planned to get married. I put a lot of effort into online dating, but the final straw was sending quality personal messages to 47 different women over six months and receiving nil positive replies. I’m in my late 50s, slim, fit, tall, of average and conventional appearance, articulate, humorous and intelligent. From hard work and living modestly, I have been able to retire and now volunteer for a charity – the task is mainly helping the sick and disabled. I also co-run a local social group for get-togethers and outings to help not only me, but others, to meet people. I discount those who are too old, those who I wouldn’t go on a see-saw with, and women who say, “Done that and got the T-shirt” about relationships – and there’s rarely anyone left. I’ve recently dated someone who talked long-term only to end it abruptly without giving a reason. This has been devastating. We only ever hugged, but this reminded me what is absent from my cold life. I have thoroughly disproved the saying “There’s someone for everyone.” There obviously isn’t. Should I resign myself to being alone for the rest of my days? Or should I keep trying and hoping to meet someone special, knowing that repeatedly failing is damaging to my self-esteem and my mental health? Philippa’s answer I probably get more emails on this topic than any other. Like you they are well-meaning and proactive about meeting people. And, like you, they’ve had bad luck. I’ve been saying: make yourself vulnerable; dare to share your feelings first; be who you really are rather than who you think you ought to be; and if someone doesn’t like you, that’s about them, don’t take it too personally. But your email has alerted me to something I may have been missing. And that is, lack of success can cause bitterness and resentment to build up. You’ve noticed it in some of the women in your social group – the ones who say, “Done that and got the T-shirt” – which got me wondering whether you are wearing one of those metaphorical T-shirts, too. Could a resigned pessimism, with a side order of bitterness, be leaking out of you? When we’ve been hurt, we build up defences; but if we do that, no one can get in. The “see-saw” comment is problematic. It sounds like you are referring to weight. This attitude may make you appear as though you are searching for a commodity to use rather than a person to relate to. People will pick up on that. Who wants to be chosen just because they’re slim? Don’t think of online dating like shopping: the perfect person is not out there. Settle for someone in the ballpark instead and when you each allow the other’s influence and dare to be flexible you just might become each other’s number one. Don’t think of yourself as just the chooser either; allow yourself to be found, too. I expect you are a nice person. And I believe most other people in your situation are also lovely, but it’s understandable that you may be wary after having been left at the altar, ghosted and rejected – but too much wariness is no help when you’re looking for intimacy. If the women who replied sounded negative, maybe, like you, they have been worn down by using dating apps. Perhaps that’s something you could ask the next time you use one of these apps. The counting of the messages made me laugh, but remember this is dating, not writing an academic paper – you have nothing to prove. There’s a hint of something else that might be putting people off – and that is how certain you seem about some things. Try to keep more of an open mind, embrace more of “don’t know” and less of being sure of what people are like and whether you’d get on with them. Put judgment to one side (people can smell “judgy” from a mile off). The way you judge your appearance and character also gives me a hint that this is how you might be judging potential dates, too. No more putting people in boxes and, anyway, your type might not be your type. Your “too old” also rang alarm bells for me. If you are only going for people younger than you, it could explain the lack of replies to your messages. You don’t have to write off ever meeting anyone and you can still get on with the rest of your life and aim to relish it as much as possible, with or without a long-term relationship. You don’t know whether you will find a partner or not and you’ll need to get comfortable with that uncertainty. Put in less effort, go on dates and outings to have fun, and don’t treat dating like an interview or a task. Be open, be you and prioritise enjoying yourself. You really don’t know what may develop.

Now she tells her story of fleeing the violence and travelling across Europe with two children and a cat in tow. ‘We cheered for every car that escaped the city’ Groups of people who wanted to leave Kherson appeared on Telegram. People shared information and exchanged ideas. The first message in our group from anyone who had escaped came from a girl called Alinka. Her boyfriend took her out along a country road. It gave us a ray of hope. I joined a few more groups and began to watch them carefully. People wrote how many checkpoints were on the way, when they left, how they arrived, what to say at the checkpoint and how to protect the car. In order for the Russians to let you through, you need to tie white ribbons to the front mirrors, and write “children” on the windscreen if there are kids in the car. We cheered for every car that left and waited with bated breath for confirmation they had reached Mykolaiv, Odesa or the Moldovan border. The situation changed every hour, so everyone took risks. I wrote in the chat that me and my two children had to leave. Then a woman called Ina wrote to me. All her relatives were against leaving but her dad agreed to drive us to Mykolaiv. We planned to leave the next morning. ‘If the cat stays, then I stay too’ It’s Sunday 20 March. I didn’t sleep until 2am and the alarm was set for 7am. I wake up at 5am and can’t get back to sleep. Ina’s dad is to drive us to Mykolaiv, from where we will travel on to Odesa. I offered to leave our cat with my mother. My daughter burst into tears and shut herself in her room. She said she wouldn’t go anywhere without the cat. “If she stays, then I’ll stay too,” she told me. “You said we’re leaving because it’s dangerous here, so it’s dangerous for her too. I won’t leave her.” I called Ina, who told me to bring the cat as she was bringing her daughter’s cat as well. So, we got into her dad’s car with the cat. Seven people and two cats travelling through a war zone in a Daewoo Lanos. There were four Orc [Russian tank] checkpoints, then Ukrainian checkpoints and traffic jams. We finally arrived at 2.30pm. The Russian checkpoints were hard psychologically, but they didn’t really check our bags. We saw bombed-out houses, scorch marks from shells in the fields, and the remains of other cars on the way. A car with the letter Z on its side drove past. Russian soldiers were digging with shovels. “Are they digging graves for themselves?” Ina’s dad joked. In Mykolaiv, we got in the car of another driver who took us to Odesa. There, we joined the queue for the station and as soon as the passage was opened, the line turned into a shapeless crowd as we hurried towards the train heading for Przemyśl, Poland. ‘Volunteers gave us food – and there were dumplings’ We woke up safe for the first night in almost a month, dreaming of dumplings. A vet vaccinated and chipped our cat. Volunteers said we should go to the west of Poland to Wrocław or Poznań, since eastern Poland is so overcrowded. Food was given out along the way (and there were dumplings). We boarded the train, but I forgot that Poland is a big country and by 9pm the children needed sleep. Poznan was at least two hours away, so I decided to get off at the next big city, Wrocław. Volunteers met us off the train and took us to eat. My son ate two servings as a woman told us to wait before someone took us back to his home. We drove 40 minutes towards a small town called Sobótka and found ourselves in a large two-storey house, with tea and sandwiches waiting for us on the table, and soft pillows and blankets in the bedroom. The family had three children. Their huge dog, Charna, rightly considered himself the main spirit of the house. I thought I would fall asleep straight away but I didn’t. I woke up twice because I thought I could hear sirens and bombs. ‘My biggest fear right now is my kids being unhappy’ Wrocław is an amazing city and there are lots of Ukrainians there. The kids read the graffiti on the wall and rejoiced at the dedications to Ukraine. After we left, they confessed that they added their own message: “Ukraine will win”, as well as the names of their pets. I’m wondering what to do next. The children are fine here but I need a job, and without knowing the language, it is not an option. I’m trying to find out more about English-speaking countries. I seriously think about applying for a British visa. I will probably be able to find a job there and I can speak the language. In the meantime, my Polish host helped me get an overnight bus to Hamburg, where we were put up by a single mother of four children. My daughter slept for the whole of the next day, but the cat acts as if nothing happened. My biggest fear right now is making my kids unhappy and I don’t actually know what is best for them. I feel really lost but not lonely because I see how many people are trying to help. Everywhere in Europe, Ukrainian flags greet us. We are happy to see any sign of our country, and to meet any Ukrainian. On our way to Hamburg we had a bus full of Ukrainians. I was happy to hear noisy Ukrainian toddlers throughout the night and even more noisy Ukrainian grandmothers trying to calm them down. The next day, I heard that my friend in Mykolaiv was killed by bombs. She is a poetess; we have known each other for 15 years. I still can’t say “was” or “knew”. Not long ago, we drank tea with croissants and discussed family history. I hoped this wasn’t true, but then I understand that this is a war and death is very close. We need to be ready for this. I wasn’t ready. ‘Life is getting better and better’ Good news. A friend of a friend of a friend from London has said he will be our host and can provide two spare rooms for us to live in. I struggled to fill out the visa form. I kept thinking of Bucha, Mariupol, Kharkiv and Kherson and my head became filled with many questions. Why is this war happening? When will it stop? How many victims are there today? Why are children dying? It became impossible to concentrate. Obtaining a British visa is a long process, so we decided to go to Sweden. I read many books by Astrid Lindgren to my children and wanted to immerse the children in this joyous atmosphere. I didn’t want to be far from Germany to ensure I can get to London quickly, once the visa is arranged. My children are still scared of aeroplanes because of the Russian warplanes but, thankfully, there is the Eurostar. We settled in a picturesque village near Stockholm, next to a very beautiful lake, and finally felt safe. We visited Stockholm, which has free public transport for Ukrainians. Our host introduced me to another woman from Ukraine, who had left Kharkiv with her two children, and we went to Junibacken, a park dedicated to Lindgren and other Swedish writers, together. Life is getting better. We are no longer as numb as when we left Ukraine. On 8 April, we received visa confirmation, so we can go to the UK. It happened quicker than expected, but it will make sense to travel after Easter to avoid traffic and crowds. The people we are living with said we can stay as long as we need. At least we can now plan for our future – but it doesn’t stop me from feeling hesitant about it.",News/World news,‘I feel really lost but not lonely’: a Kherson mother’s diary of flight from a war zone,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/17/ukraine-kherson-mothers-diary-of-flight-from-a-war-zone
4/17/2022,"The UK medicines watchdog has been urged to strengthen its conflict of interest policy after it emerged that six of its board members are receiving payments from the pharmaceutical industry. Board members involved in overseeing the regulator’s “strategic direction” also have financial interests in companies including US and Saudi drug giants and firms with ambitions to break into the UK’s healthcare market. Some offer consultancy services while others help run or own shares in drug and medical device firms, according to official transparency records. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing, but the findings have led to concerns about perceived conflicts of interest among senior figures at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), an executive agency of the Department of Health and Social Care responsible for regulating drugs and medical devices and ensuring they are safe. The MHRA said that “in order to be an effective regulator” it needed to “bring together the right expertise from across industry, academia, the public and beyond”, adding that board meetings are held in public and non-executive board members – to whom the potential conflicts relate – are not involved in “any work or decisions relating to the regulation of any products”. But critics raised concerns about the potential for bias – or the perception of it – and called for stricter rules on conflicts of interest for those working in pharmaceutical regulation. The board is responsible for helping set strategic priorities and advising on the delivery of policies, potentially giving members access to information that could be useful in their positions at outside organisations. David Rowland, director of the Centre for Health and the Public Interest thinktank, said regulators needed to be “whiter than white” in order to maintain “the absolute trust of the public” – particularly when they are responsible for “licensing new and potentially innovative products and devices”. “We’ve seen during the pandemic a lot of people questioning the reliability and safety of vaccines and other treatments,” he said. “Once people start thinking there are potential financial gains to be made it’s very difficult to get that trust back.” Of 16 board members, six have declared financial interests in drug or medical device companies, or firms working on their behalf, according to Observer analysis of official transparency records published in February. All but one of the six joined the board in September and each of the appointments was signed off by the Department of Health. Dr Junaid Bajwa, chief medical scientist at Microsoft, is also a non-executive director of Ondine Biomedical, a Canadian life sciences company, and Nahdi Medical, a Saudi pharmaceutical firm, according to the logs. He also owns shares in the pharmaceutical company Merck Sharp and Dohme and is a paid adviser to the Swiss firm Novartis. Dr Paul Goldsmith is a shareholder and director of Closed Loop Medicine, which is developing hypertension and insomnia products, according to its website. He owns shares in Summit Inc, a drug discovery and development company, and Ieso, which intends to seek approval for its autonomous digital tools – AI therapy – in future. Raj Long offers paid “access advisory” services to Huya Bio, a Chinese company that aims to enable “faster, more cost-effective and lower-risk drug development in the global markets”, and is a shareholder in Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis, while Amanda Calvert, who has been a non-executive director of the MHRA’s board since 2019, is the director of Quince Consultancy, whose clients include drug companies. Haider Husain, appointed to the MHRA board as a “non-voting associate non-executive director”, is chief operating officer of Healthinnova, which provides consultancy services on “how to derive the most value from digital health investments”. Meanwhile, Prof Graham Cooke, deputy chair of the MHRA’s board, is a paid adviser to two medical device companies, and an unpaid adviser to a third – DnaNudge, which offers DNA-tailored diet products as well as being a provider of rapid Covid-19 tests. The MHRA has a strict conflict of interest policy for staff and is currently reviewing its rules for advisers on its expert committees, such as the Commission on Human Medicines and the advisory boards for herbal and homeopathic medicines, to ensure “experts providing us with advice are independent and impartial”. But it said last week that it had no plans to review the policies for non-executive board members, who currently are permitted to have industry links provided they are declared. Other regulators, such as the Gambling Commission, bar board members from accepting payments from, or owning shares in, companies in the gambling industry. And last week, a non-executive director of the Civil Aviation Authority’s board, whose appointment was signed off by the Department for Transport, resigned due to a potential conflict of interest because he owns shares in British Airways’ parent company. Harry Cayton, former chief executive of the Professional Standards Authority, said it was valuable to have industry figures as board members and that there was “bound to [be] a level of crossover”. “The point is not, ‘Are you on the board of the MHRA?’ but are you making decisions that relate to your interests?” he said. But Prof John Abraham, an expert in medical regulation and former policy adviser, called for those involved in health regulation to be required to relinquish “all direct and personal financial conflicts of interest” in order to uphold public trust. “The response by regulators over many years is that they couldn’t get the expertise that they need to advise. That’s just not very plausible because there are so many scientists and experts out there,” he said. In 2020, the Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review, led by life peer Julia Cumberlege, raised concerns about conflicts of interest in medical regulation and called for an “overhaul of the culture” of the MHRA. “Steps should be taken to ensure that the patient perspective and the public interest always takes precedence over the interests of industry,” the review said. The MHRA said non-executive board members were appointed to provide “constructive challenge and advice on the strategic direction of the MHRA” through an “open and transparent process” operated by the Department of Health. “Conflicts of interest are considered on a case-by-case basis on appointment and at the start of every board meeting,” it added.",News/Society,Medical regulator faces questions over board members’ links to drug firms,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/17/medical-regulator-faces-questions-over-board-members-links-to-drug-firms
4/17/2022,"Senior government frontbencher Marise Payne has distanced herself from the controversial Liberal candidate for the Sydney seat of Warringah, saying it is a matter for the party organisation whether Katherine Deves is disendorsed. The foreign minister was pointed in her remarks on the range of captain’s picks overseen by Scott Morrison in lieu of normal preselection processes in New South Wales, telling the ABC’s Insiders program: “Some of them are fabulous candidates.” Morrison has faced a mutiny from Liberal moderates, with intensifying calls for Deves to be dumped in the race against independent MP Zali Steggall because of comments about transgender people. A string of news stories over the past week have revealed inflammatory comments on various social media platforms including one where Deves equated anti-trans activism to standing up against the Holocaust during a YouTube panel. Payne said she did not share Deves’ views, and she noted the candidate had “apologised” and “withdrawn those views”. “As the prime minister said yesterday, in public life, we do have to be very careful about the way we express our opinions. Most importantly, we have to exercise sensitivity and respect,” Payne said. “And in this case, in the case of the massively complex and extremely challenging issues that accompany any individual’s decisions about transition and transgender issues, overwhelmingly that has to be the approach that we take – one of sensitivity and one of respect. And that is my view.” Payne stopped short of calling for Deves to be disendorsed, declining multiple opportunities to request that action, but said it was up to the party. “It’s a matter for the organisation in NSW. I need to get on with my job. That’s what I’m doing. And I don’t agree with the remarks that she made. I’ve made that explicitly clear.” Payne’s comments were notably less supportive of Deves than the minister for superannuation and financial services, Jane Hume, who said she “is going to be an excellent candidate for Warringah”. Deves co-founded the Save Women’s Sport organisation, which campaigns to restrict trans women from playing in female sporting competitions. Hume told Sky News on Sunday that Deves had “very strongly held opinions on an issue that’s important to lots of Australians and that’s fairness and equality in women’s sports” although “the language she used was inappropriate”. “The comments that she made on social media have gone, they have been withdrawn, she agrees that they were wrong, but her commitment to the cause remains and I think that that is admirable,” Hume said. However, Australia’s Sex Discrimination Act already says it is legal “to discriminate on the ground of sex, gender identity or intersex status by excluding persons from participation in any competitive sporting activity in which the strength, stamina or physique of competitors is relevant”. The NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, has called for Deves to be disendorsed. “This is not the 1950s. This is not an intolerant society. These kinds of horrendous views are not OK, and I’m sure the voters of Warringah agree,” Kean said on Saturday. The issue risks alienating voters in socially progressive Liberal-held seats such as Wentworth, Mackellar and North Sydney, although some observers have said Deves’ nomination may be a political tactic to appeal to socially conservative voters in outer suburban seats. Sophie Scamps, the independent candidate for Mackellar, said the incumbent Liberal MP Jason Falinski needed to clarify whether he agreed with Deves’ views, characterising it as a “huge test of integrity”. Falinski tweeted two weeks ago: “Congratulations Katherine Deves. An excellent selection for Warringah.” In an interview on Sunday, Scamps said Falinksi should follow the lead of Kean. She pointed to the existing exemptions in the Sex Discrimination Act. “My view is that Catherine Deves – I think she’s scapegoating an already very vulnerable group of people for her own political ambitions. The reason I say that is that not one person in this electorate has ever raised it as an issue of concern for them to me or to anyone in my team,” Scamps said. “He [Falinski] launched her campaign. He’s supporting her. Does he support her views?” Comment was sought from Falinski. Morrison defended Deves on Saturday, telling reporters: “I’m not joining that pile on.” Morrison pointed to comments made by Tony Abbott, the former prime minister and member for Warringah, who praised Deves as “tough” and “brave” and said he “can’t understand the pile on from people who claim to be supporters of women’s rights”. The ongoing saga overshadowed Morrison’s announcement on Sunday that the social services minister, Anne Ruston, would become health and aged care minister if the Coalition is re-elected on 21 May. “Anne’s experience as a senior minister managing a complex portfolio touching millions of lives makes her the right pick to help guide Australia’s health system out of the pandemic,” Morrison said.",News/Australia news,"NSW Liberals should decide whether Katherine Deves is disendorsed, Marise Payne says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/17/nsw-liberals-should-decide-whether-katherine-deves-is-disendorsed-marise-payne-says
