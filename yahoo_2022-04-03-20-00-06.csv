Former President Donald Trump referred to White House press secretary Jen Psaki as ""the woman with the really beautiful red hair"" at his rally in Michigan on Saturday. While complimenting her hair, Trump criticized Psaki for once joking about the nation's Space Force, a branch of the US military forces set up by Trump. ""The woman with the really beautiful red hair, she laughed. And she was hit so hard by the military because they knew I was right. The military understood I was right."" —Acyn (@Acyn) April 3, 2022 The former president also addressed a report by Axios that Psaki plans to leave the White House this spring and is in talks to join MSNBC. ""You know she's going to MSDNC,"" Trump said, using his derogatory nickname for the cable news network. ""They need a redhead. They don't have a redhead over there, so they need a redhead."" Psaki joining MSNBC would not be unusual, as most White House press secretaries over the last two decades moved on to a cable news job after leaving the White House, according to Axios. When asked about the resignation rumors in a news briefing on Friday, Psaki said she had ""nothing to confirm"" about her future plans. Trump has a long record of commenting on women's appearances, often publicly assessing the attractiveness of female celebrities and politicians.

4/3/2022,"Several Russian billionaires have reportedly become tearful as the impact of sanctions hits home. A personal assistant to multiple oligarchs told The Mirror it was hard to have ""any sympathy."" Russia's wealthiest businessmen, and their families, have been targeted by Western sanctions. A personal assistant to several sanctioned Russian oligarchs said they have witnessed the men break down in tears due to their assets being frozen. The Mirror first reported the news. Vladimir Putin's unprovoked war in Ukraine has led Western countries to take action against Russia, including targeting his allies, who are some of Russia's wealthiest businessmen. ""I have had to endure hearing them in tears because they can't get on board a private jet or book a holiday or even get an Uber anymore,"" the personal assistant, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, told The Mirror. Per the outlet, the assistant works for the oligarchs who live in Surrey's St George's Estate, in the UK. This is a gated enclave where a third of the residents are Russian, according to The Mirror. It's also considered to be one of the most exclusive private residential addresses outside of London, according to property finder Garrington South. The Mirror report added that some of the oligarchs had to ask staff to pay for their cabs because the Uber executive accounts linked to their cards had been closed. The assistant told The Mirror: ""It's hard to have any sympathy. It doesn't matter to them if people are dying in Ukraine."" She added that an oligarch's wife collapsed in tears after bespoke electrical fittings ordered for her $13 million (£10 million) mansion were blocked. Sanctions have also targeted oligarchs' families, such as in the case of Gennady Timchenko whose wife and daughters have been impacted by the restrictions. Speaking about oligarch families in general, the assistant said: ""They care only about themselves and how the sanctions are starting to affect their champagne lifestyle,"" the assistant told The Mirror. They concluded: ""But that's all changing now and it's good to see them having to adjust to their new place in the world.""
