3/10/2022,"Good morning. The US has moved to drastically step up its support for Ukraine, with House lawmakers passing a $13bn aid bill as the country’s president condemned a Russian attack on a children’s hospital as proof that a “genocide” is being carried out. Volodymyr Zelenskiy shared footage of a destroyed hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol, saying on Telegram: “The aerial bombing of a children’s hospital is the ultimate evidence that genocide of Ukrainians is happening.” The White House condemned the attack as “barbaric”. The US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, indicated the $13.6bn US aid package was likely to be just the first part of raft of aid measures to be provided to Ukraine, saying that “all of us will have to do more” to help the country. Meanwhile, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, has warned that Russia may be preparing to use chemical or biological weapons. Fighting stopped a humanitarian convoy from from reaching Mariupol, along one of seven corridors to besieged cities set up by Ukraine. Russian troops are reported to have seized parts of Mariupol. How will the $13.6bn be spent? It will be split between military and humanitarian aid: $6.5bn to send troops and weapons to eastern Europe; $6.8bn for refugees and economic aid for allies. When will the bill pass? Senate approval is expected within days. At least one of Donald Trump’s lawyers knew that interrupting the certification of Joe Biden’s election win as part of a plot to return the former president to office would be unlawful, an email exchange has shown. John Eastman, Trump’s former lawyer who helped organise the scheme from the “war room” at the Willard hotel in Washington, admitted in an email to Greg Jacob, counsel for the then vice-president, Mike Pence, that it would be a violation of the Electoral Count Act. However, Eastman encouraged Pence to go ahead with it anyway, saying it was only a “minor violation” of the statute that governed the certification procedure. Who else knew? The email exchange raises the prospect that others in the Willard, including Trump’s former attorney Rudy Giuliani and former strategist Steve Bannon, were also aware of the scheme’s unlawfulness. How significant are the emails? The exchange weakens arguments by Eastman and the rest of the team that they believed there was no wrongdoing in Pence delaying the certification beyond 6 January. Fossil fuel companies are investing in campaigns to appear as defenders of Indigenous interests amid protests against a controversial gas pipeline on First Nation land, an investigation by Eco-Bot.Net and the Guardian has revealed. Ads conveying Indigenous support for the Coastal GasLink pipeline appeared on the Facebook and Instagram feeds of people in British Columbia as Wet’suwet’en Nation members were being evicted from their territory near the pipeline. The ads spiked last November during land defense protests. The investigation found that the fossil fuel groups spent some C$122,000 (US$95,249) on more than 400 targeted Facebook and Instagram ads over the past two years relating to projects around the country. The overwhelming majority were linked to the Coastal GasLink pipeline, a 670km pipeline through unceded Wet’suwet’en territory that has faced opposition from some Indigenous and environmental groups. What is ‘Indigenous-washing’? The term is used to refer to high-polluting companies misleading the public about their relationship to Indigenous peoples and their land. Did the ads just target British Columbia? Initially, before moving to parts of the country with strong solidarity protests, such as Ontario. Guatemala has increased punishment for abortions, with women who terminate pregnancies facing up to 10 years in prison, up from three. It also explicitly banned same-sex marriage, though it was already in effect illegal. Thousands of demonstrators have gathered in Brazil’s capital to protest against the “ecocide” being waged under the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro. The protest in Brasília was held in opposition to five environment-related bills being considered by Brazil’s congress. A critically endangered species of bat not seen in 40 years has been found in Rwanda. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) listed the Hill’s horseshoe bat as critically endangered in 2021. Russia has detained 13,789 protesters opposing the country’s invasion of Ukraine since 24 February. While this number may seem large, it should not be read as an indication of vast anti-war movement, as the detention rate is “likely much higher than in normal conditions”, writes Sasha de Vogel. Although many are against the war, some are “barely aware of it” due to draconian media censorship which has made it a crime to use the terms war, attack or invasion. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, there has been a flurry of international coverage focusing on foreign couples using paid Ukrainian surrogate mothers. The articles often make little reference to the surrogates’ wellbeing, and sometimes the couples appear “indifferent to the plight of the women left behind”, writes Sirin Kale in this exploration of the treatment of Ukrainian surrogates during the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe.

3/10/2022,"On 2 March, as the number of Ukrainian refugees fleeing Russia’s brutal invasion reached 1 million, the United Nations security council called an emergency session of the general assembly. There, 193 nations reviewed a resolution on Russia’s “aggression against Ukraine” and voted overwhelmingly to approve it: 141 votes in favor, 35 abstentions and just five votes against. Even some of Russia’s closest allies on the continent – Serbia, for example, or Hungary – voted to condemn the invasion. “The message of the general assembly is loud and clear,” said the UN secretary-general, António Guterres. What exactly is that message? In recent days, many commentators have pointed to a global map of the UN resolution to demonstrate the unity of the west and the world in taking on the Putin government. But to make sense of the geopolitical consequences of the Russian invasion, we must look beyond the diplomatic theater of the general assembly to examine how these nations are actually engaged with the war in this phase of rapid escalation. And to do that, we should start with a very different map of the world – a map of global participation in the sanctions set against Russia by the United States and its allies. The contrast between these maps could not be more striking. The US, the UK, Canada, South Korea, Switzerland, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Singapore, the EU: beyond this fortified coalition, very few nations have chosen to take part in the economic warfare set against the Putin government. On the contrary, many of the world’s largest nations – including China, India, Brazil, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, and even Nato ally Turkey – have refused to join in. “We will not blindly follow the steps taken by another country,” said Indonesia’s foreign ministry representative at a recent press conference. Latin America has been equally steadfast in its commitment to neutrality. “We do not consider that [this war] concerns us,” said the Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. “We are not going to take any sort of economic reprisal because we want to have good relations with all governments.” Argentina may have voted to condemn Russia’s actions at the UN, but its foreign minister, Santiago Cafiero, was adamant about his country’s non-participation in the new sanctions push: “Argentina does not consider that they are a mechanism to generate peace and harmony, or generate a frank dialogue table that serves to save lives.” The Latin American position has been echoed in Africa. “For five centuries, we have been pawns in the hands of the warring European states, bent on looting Africa of its human and natural sources,” says Pierre Sané, president of the Imagine Africa Institute and former secretary-general of Amnesty International. Sané tells me that the embassy in Ukraine has been recruiting “volunteer” mercenaries from countries like Senegal and Ivory Coast to fight in the war. “Should this war in Ukraine escalate, we say and we say it loud: do not bring it to our shores.” Amid the Russian army’s brutal advance into Ukraine, a slew of letters, articles and Twitter commentary has addressed the “western left” for its apparent unwillingness to take on the Putin government. The invasion of Ukraine has been described as a “test” to root out the “pseudo-leftists” who fail to respond with force and conviction to support the west in its effort to isolate, undermine and eventually topple Putin in defense of the Ukrainian cause. But the map of sanctions suggests that the true rift is not between left and right, nor even between east and west. On the contrary, the map reveals a rift between north and south, between the nations that we call developed and those we call developing. And by revealing this tectonic shift, the map can tell us something important about geopolitics in the coming age of multipolarity. The rapid rise of China and the US reaction it has provoked have prompted many commentators to predict a coming cold war. Few expected Vladimir Putin to kick it off so suddenly. “Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has ended Americans’ 30-year holiday from history,” writes the former CIA director Robert Gates for the Washington Post. The immediate eviction of Russian representatives and Russian culture from the institutions of the west suggest the long slumber of the cold war may indeed be over: “Putin’s war has provided the cold shower needed to awaken democratic governments to the reality of a new world.” The good news for Gates is that the Biden administration has already found its cold war footing. Its flagship Summit for Democracy strives to unite “the nations of the free world” – a remarkable homage to the era of anti-Soviet mobilization – while isolating autocracies like Russia and China. That is, with the usual exceptions: Saudi Arabia’s oil, for example, grants the nation a free pass to the “free world”, as made evident by the recent delegation dispatched by the Biden administration to secure the kingdom’s support to keep the oil flowing through the war effort in Ukraine. In the age of unipolarity – in the long 30-year holiday that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union – the nations of the world were given a rather simple choice: side with the United States, or stand alone. Some nations sought to band together in collective acts of resistance to this hegemonic power. But the consequences were all but inevitable: invasions, coups and extensive sanctions to isolate their economies from the world at large. As new powers generate new poles, however, the options available to US neighbor nations are no longer restricted to compliance and resistance. A third option emerges: neutrality. “Neutrality does not mean indifference,” says Pierre Sané. “Neutrality means continuously calling for the respect of international laws; neutrality means that our hearts still go to the victims of military invasions and arbitrary sanctions never imposed on Nato countries.” Back in the first cold war, neutrality had a name: non-alignment. As the United States clashed with China and the Soviet Union in the skies above Korea, Jawaharlal Nehru and Josip Broz Tito refused to take a side. “The people of Yugoslavia cannot accept the postulate that humanity today has only one choice – a choice between a domination of one or the other bloc,” Yugoslavia’s minister of foreign affairs, Edvard Kardelj, told the UN in 1950. “We believe that there exists another road.” The Non-Aligned Movement was born five years later, uniting more than 100 nations around the world around principles of non-interference and peaceful coexistence. Today, nations around the world are called again to take sides – between Russia and the west, and very soon between the west and China. But as the map of sanctions attests, the cross-pressure between these great powers may once again spark a movement for non-alignment, demanding a more universal application of international law against demands for unilateral exception. There will no doubt be consequences for this neutral position. Non-aligned nations in the first cold war were frequently victim to aggression, invasion and economic embargo. The same risks to neutrality are visible today. Lithuania recently canceled a shipment of Covid vaccines to Bangladesh for its refusal to condemn Russia at the United Nations. The US, for its part, has already passed the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Caatsa), giving license to punish countries with sanctions for trading with the other side. But as great powers prepare for a new century of war, the call for non-alignment will only grow louder. Our task is to understand that call now as Tito and Nehru understood it then: not as “neutralism” or “passivity, as is sometimes alleged”. As they wrote in a joint declaration in 1954: “It represents the positive, active and constructive policy that, as its goal, has collective peace as the foundation of collective security.” David Adler is a political economist and general coordinator of the Progressive International",Opinion/Opinion,The West v Russia: why the global south isn’t taking sides | David Adler,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/10/russia-ukraine-west-global-south-sanctions-war
3/10/2022,"Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said there had been no progress to achieving a ceasefire in talks in Turkey with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in the first high-level meeting between the two countries since the Moscow-ordered invasion of its neighbour two weeks ago. Talks got under way near Antalya amid an outpouring of international outrage over Russia’s attack on a children’s hospital in the besieged city of Mariupol. The bombing of the 600-bed children’s and maternity hospital that injured pregnant women was evidence of “genocide” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said. The White House called the attack barbaric. As western leaders condemned the bombing, Ukraine’s foreign minister and officials were pictured sitting opposite the Russian delegation as the brief talks that Kuleba described as both “easy and difficult” got under way. In comments after the talks broke up, Lavrov said the hospital had been under the control of “Ukrainian radicals” and denied that any patients were present. He said the west had caused the conflict by forcing Ukraine to choose between Russia and the west. Kuleba called for Russia to allow the evacuation of civilians from Mariupol. He said Ukraine was ready for diplomacy but also able to defend itself as it appeared that Russia would fight on and was seeking a surrender from Kyiv. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, who brokered the meeting, said before it began that the aim was to pave the way for talks between Russian president Vladimir Putin and Zelenskiy, facilitated by Turkey’s leader, Recep Tayip Erdoğan. Turkey, which is a Nato member and which has not imposed sanctions on Russia but has condemned the attack and allowed Turkish-built drones to be bought by Ukraine, is trying to position itself as a neutral broker in the conflict. The Kremlin has said it would stop the war if Ukraine ceased military action, enshrined in its constitution that it had no plans to join Nato, gave up annexed Crimea and recognised the separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states. EU leaders, meanwhile, prepared to meet at Versailles to discuss Ukraine’s application to join their ranks. Ahead of the Versailles summit, convened by France’s President Emmanuel Macron, Kuleba stepped up the pressure on the EU to grant Ukraine a fast-track route to membership. Recounting a phone call he had with his French counterpart, Jean-Yves Le Drian, Kuleba tweeted that he had “underscored the historic importance of granting EU membership to Ukraine which now fights for itself and entire Europe”. While Ukraine’s membership bid, swiftly followed by applications from Georgia and Moldova, has been warmly welcomed by central and eastern European countries, older members are wary of moving too quickly, with a country at war that has long struggled with deep-rooted corruption. “This will not happen in the short term, because this is a whole process taking many years,” the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said. France’s Europe minister, Clément Beaune, agreed, saying: “It will take time.” Acknowledging the divisions, a senior EU official said: “Part of the room wants to move swiftly, another part of the room of leaders wants to have some better distance and see, and have a proper discussion at a later stage whether Ukraine should join the union.” Despite pressure from central and eastern European governments, the draft summit communique does not mention the EU’s membership application clause, treaty article 49. Instead, EU leaders will invite the European Commission to submit an opinion on Ukraine’s application – the normal bureaucratic procedure – “pending this and without delay, we will further strengthen our bonds and deepen our partnership”, states a draft summit statement seen by the Guardian, with the recent addition: “Ukraine belongs to our European family.” Separately, the UK announced on Thursday that it was adding seven Russian businessmen to its sanctions list, including the metals billionaire and Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, described by the Foreign Office as “one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin”. The British government is also imposing asset freezes on Putin ally Igor Sechin, the owner of Russian state oil company Rosneft, and Oleg Deripaska, an aluminium magnate believed by the Foreign Office to be worth £2bn. Britain and the US are warning that Russia could be setting the stage to use a chemical weapon in Ukraine after Kremlin officials alleged without firm evidence that the US had been supporting a bioweapons programme in the country. The White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday that Russia had been making “false claims about alleged US biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development in Ukraine”, adding that the allegations had been echoed in Beijing. “Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,” she tweeted. Meanwhile UK intelligence highlighted the strength of the Ukrainian resistance. In an update on Thursday, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said the large Russian column north-west of Kyiv had made “little progress in over a week” and suffers continued losses at the hands of Ukraine forces. The MoD added that there had been a noticeable drop in Russian air activity in recent days, probably due to the “unexpected effectiveness” of Ukraine’s forces. It also said Russia has deployed conscript troops despite assurances from Putin not to do so. As the Russian president seeks to regain momentum, local authorities described the damage to the Mariupol hospital as “colossal” and said women in labour were among the wounded. A local official said the attack injured at least 17 staff, though no deaths were immediately reported. Zelenskiy said the “direct strike by Russian troops” had left children under the wreckage. The deputy mayor, Sergei Orlov, said Mariupol was being shelled continuously and 1,170 residents had died, 47 of whom were buried in a mass grave on Wednesday. “It’s medieval,” he said. “It’s pure genocide. The attack isn’t simply treacherous. It’s a war crime. They are attacking us with aviation, shells, multiple rocket launchers.” The Guardian was unable to verify the Ukrainian officials’ accounts, but video published by the Associated Press showed multiple injured people at the site of the hospital attack. The Red Cross has described conditions in the port city as “apocalyptic”, while the deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said the situation was “catastrophic”. Zelenskiy compared the devastation and suffering there to that caused by the Nazis. Journalists have described corpses in the streets and hungry residents breaking into shops in search of food and being forced to melt snow for drinking water while thousands shelter in basements.",News/World news,Ukraine says talks in Turkey with Russia fail to make progress towards ceasefire,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/ukraine-talks-turkey-russia-fail-progress-ceasefire
3/10/2022,"Last December, as Russian forces encircled Ukraine, the Biden administration and its allies delivered a stark warning to Vladimir Putin: “Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited under international law.” In January, as Russian troops massed even in even greater numbers, Secretary of State Antony Blinken added that “the inviolability of frontiers” was among the “guiding principles for international behavior.” Last month, after Russia’s parliament recognized the independence of two self-declared republics Moscow had cleaved from eastern Ukraine, Blinken called this infringement upon “Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity” a “gross violation of international law.” All this is indisputably true. Remaking borders by force violates a core principle of international law. Which is why the Biden administration must do more than resist Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. It must stop violating that principle itself. In 2019, the Trump administration made the United States the only foreign country to recognize Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 War. Tel Aviv University Law Professor Eliav Lieblich noted that the decision – which contradicted a unanimous United Nations Security Council resolution supported by the US itself – constituted a “significant departure from the bedrock legal prohibition of unilateral annexation.” Yale Law School’s Oona Hathaway called the move “outrageous and potentially destabilizing to the postwar international order.” The Russian government called it an “indication of the contempt that Washington shows for the norms of international law.” After Trump’s move, Illinois Senator Richard Durbin asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to explain the legal difference between Israel’s annexation of the Golan and Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, which had led the US to impose sanctions. Pompeo replied that “there’s international law doctrine on this very point. We don’t have time to begin to go through it today. But [I’m] happy to have a team go over and walk you through that.” When journalists followed up, the State Department cited no international law doctrine at all. To the contrary, a department spokeswoman declared, nonsensically, that “The US policy continues to be that no country can change the borders of another by force.” Then, in 2020, the Trump administration followed up by making the United States the only foreign country to recognize Morocco’s annexation of Western Sahara, a territory Morocco invaded in 1975 after the territory’s Spanish colonial rulers withdrew. Former Secretary of State James Baker III called the decision an “astounding retreat from the principles of international law.” Once again, the United States contradicted Security Council resolutions it had supported itself. Once again, Russia blasted the US for transgressing a “universally recognized international legal” principle. Since taking office, the Biden administration has reversed neither of these Trump decisions. To the contrary, the US continues to provide Israel almost $4 billion in military aid per year absent any human rights conditions even as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International allege that it is practicing apartheid. The Biden administration has also boosted arms sales to Morocco even though the US-based democracy watchdog Freedom House reports that people in Western Sahara enjoy fewer freedoms than people in China or Iran. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine gives the Biden administration a chance to reconsider this dangerous path. It can harness the current global revulsion against Putin’s aggression to rebuild the principle that no country should redraw another’s borders by force. But only if it reverses Trump’s decisions and proves that the US is willing to live by the standards it demands of Moscow. Politically, that won’t be easy since Israel, which enjoys strong support in Washington, benefitted from both of Trump’s decisions—his decision on the Golan Heights and his decision on Western Sahara, which helped convince Morocco to normalize diplomatic relations with the Jewish state. But international norms only remain strong if countries abide by them when they’re inconvenient. And if the US chooses continued hypocrisy, it will make Ukraine, Taiwan and every other weaker nation bordered by a rapacious neighbor more vulnerable. After Secretary of State Pompeo defended Trump’s recognition of Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights, Senator Durbin warned that, “I don’t think the administration is thinking clearly about how this ends well.” He was right. The continued erosion of the norm against international aggression will not end well. Russia’s attack on Ukraine is just the latest sign. The Biden administration can stem that erosion now. But in addition to the military battle it is assisting in Ukraine, it must wage a political battle at home.

3/10/2022,"Higher levels of exposure to toxic PFAS “forever chemicals” may increase the likelihood of Covid-19 infection, more serious symptoms and death, a group of recent studies have found. Public health advocates and researchers have feared since the coronavirus pandemic’s onset that PFAS, which are known to be immunotoxic, could hinder the body’s ability to fight Covid-19, and the four studies represent the first bit of research supporting the theory. However, the authors caution that more research is needed. “There’s clear science and evidence that immunological response and PFAS are connected and associated – that’s why the Covid aspect is so important to pursue,” said Christel Nielsen, one of the study’s co-authors. PFAS, or per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 9,000 compounds most often used to make products water-, stain- and heat-resistant, and are called “forever chemicals” because they don’t naturally break down. They’re so effective that they’re used in thousands of applications across dozens of industries, but they’re also linked to cancer, decreased immunity, liver disease, kidney problems, birth defects and more. PFAS are estimated to be in about 97% of Americans’ blood, and have been detected in all corners of the globe, including the Arctic. Some compounds can remain in the body for years or decades, depending on the quantity and chemical structure. Pre-pandemic studies have strongly suggested that the chemicals reduce vaccine efficacy in children, and several studies of how high PFAS levels impact the Covid vaccines are under way. The chemicals are probably immunotoxic because they interfere with the body’s ability to create cells that turn into plasma. Plasma generates the antibodies that fight infection, and PFAS compounds appear to impact “key molecules” in that process, said Phillipe Grandjean, an environmental health professor at Harvard. A study he co-authored found one widely-used compound, PFBA, seemed to be particularly problematic. PFAS that are commonly used to repel water and grease in food packaging, or used as stain and waterproofing agents in clothing, shoes and carpeting can turn into PFBA when they break down. The study’s authors checked plasma samples from 323 Danish residents who had Covid and looked for five PFAS compounds known to be immunotoxic. The study found detectable PFBA in plasma showed “a clear association with a more severe” symptoms and death. “If you had PFBA in your blood, then you were more likely to go to the hospital, and to stay longer, to get into intensive care and to die from the infection,” said Grandjean. More than 20 of those people who had PFBA in their blood had died. “The likelihood of this happening accidentally is extremely small,” Grandjean said. Industry has said “short-chain” compounds like PFBA are safe because they don’t stay in the blood for as long as many other PFAS, but the study casts doubt on that claim. While many PFAS accumulate in the blood, PFBA accumulates in the lungs, and appears to exacerbate symptoms because of that trait. It did so even when it was found at lower levels than other compounds. “The unique retention of PFBA in lung tissue may offer a clue to” why PFBA seems to cause more serious disease, the study stated. PFAS exposure has also been linked to obesity and diabetes, the authors noted, which can intensify Covid symptoms. The chemicals have endocrine-disrupting properties that seem to mimic, block, or otherwise interfere with hormones that affect immunity. Two studies looked at whether exposure to high levels of PFAS increased the risk of infection. Researchers in Sweden checked infection rates from the pandemic’s first year in Ronneby, a town of about 30,000 where one-third of the population was for decades exposed to highly contaminated drinking water, and the entire population has elevated blood levels. The infection rate was about 19% higher than in a nearby town with water that didn’t have elevated PFAS levels. The study also found that people with lower PFAS blood levels were more likely to be infected, though contamination is so great in Ronneby that lower levels there are still higher than the general population. The authors characterized their analysis as a “fast and easy” way to look for a public health correlation and determine whether more investigation is needed: “This is something that clearly warrants further research,” said Nielsen, a study co-author, who added that they are undertaking a second more in-depth study and looking into the chemicals’ impact on vaccine efficacy. Chinese researchers with similar aim checked urine and blood samples from 160 residents in the Shanxi and Shandong provinces, two regions heavily polluted by PFAS. The study compared samples from 80 people who had either tested positive for Covid and 80 who had never been infected, and found “significantly higher risks of [Covid] infection in the subjects with increased urinary PFOS, PFOA,” two of the most toxic and widely used compounds. An ecological study in Italy looked into morbidity rates among those exposed to high levels of the chemicals for 65 years in the Veneto region. An examination of a population of 200,000 found those exposed to high levels of PFAS had a 27% higher Covid mortality rate. The population was exposed to a mix of at least 12 compounds, which included PFBA. The data “might plausibly suggest a general immunosuppressive effect of PFAS, it might be a quite specific effect of PFBA concentrating in the lungs and exacerbating Covid respiratory toxicity, or PFAS might lead to other conditions that predispose people with coronavirus infection to more severe disease”, the study’s authors wrote. Co-author Annibale Bieggeri called the issue “an injustice”, adding that PFAS can also increase the likelihood of a variant because the virus will stay in bodies for longer. He said the studies findings should prompt public health officials to make special considerations for areas highly affected by PFAS. Researchers say there’s little that someone who has been exposed to high levels of the chemicals, or has high levels in their blood, can do beyond the usual precautions. “The most important recommendation that we can give is to get vaccinated, pure and simple, for everyone, and perhaps particularly in a highly exposed area,” said Swedish study co-author Anna Joud.",News/Environment,"Higher levels of PFAS exposure may increase chance of Covid, studies say",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/pfas-covid-infection-forever-chemicals-studies
3/10/2022,"On 24 October 2019, Maura Healey, the attorney general of Massachusetts, sued ExxonMobil for “deceptive advertising” and for “misleading Massachusetts investors about the risks to Exxon’s business posed by fossil fuel-driven climate change”. It was the culmination of an investigation Healey had launched in 2016 looking into how Exxon allegedly misled the public about climate, decades after its own scientists had briefed the company on the realities of the issue. This week, the Massachusetts supreme court is hearing arguments related to that case – but not about Exxon’s actions decades earlier. Instead, the oil company wants the courts to decide whether Healey violated its first amendment rights by bringing the suit in the first place. With all of its other legal options exhausted, Exxon’s efforts to stop this case hinge on the one last complaint: invoking Massachusetts’ anti-Slapp statute. Slapp stands for Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation, and statutes against such legal claims originated out of efforts to protect the press and civil society groups from corporations that wanted to silence critics. In recent years, however, it’s become increasingly common for corporations to invoke anti-Slapp laws instead to protect their first amendment rights. The anti-Slapp argument has become a go-to strategy in US climate litigation. In some two dozen climate liability cases, in which counties, cities and states are asking oil companies to pay their share of climate adaptation costs, the oil company defendants have argued that their public statements about climate change were not “deceptive” so much as persuasive. They describe their ads, op-eds and public appearances discouraging climate action as “petitioning” statements, turning them into political speech that is protected by the first amendment. Never before published internal documents from Mobil Oil reveal that company executives created the framework of corporate free speech back in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The argument arose out of a situation not unlike the one playing out today, with war driving up prices at the pump and oil companies wanting desperately to change the public’s perception of their industry. The longtime Mobil VP of public affairs, Herbert Schmertz, and then CEO, Rawleigh Warner, came up with an idea to help them wrestle back control of the narrative and win over the public: using Mobil’s PR and advertising budget, they would create “idea advertising”, also known as “issue” or “advocacy” advertising, to push the company’s take on key issues of the day and to create the sense of Mobil as a citizen, with a distinct personality. In a 1971 strategy document explaining the reasons for this approach, Schmertz wrote: “We expect consumers increasingly to factor their notions of a company’s social responsiveness into their decisions about buying its products and stock.” In an interview about the strategy a few years later Schmertz explained, “Legislation does not develop in a vacuum. It grows out of public attitudes and mirrors public beliefs. When it comes to matters of energy, the oil industry tends to be viewed as the villain.” By 1970, Mobil began running weekly advertorials in the New York Times presenting the company’s point of view and, as Schmertz put it, “trying to explain the energy industry to the American people”. But the ads weren’t just policy stances – Mobil also used the space to develop what Schmertz called its “corporate persona”, where the company openly supported everything from public transit to the arts and educational programs. At the same time, Mobil began funding programming on PBS, starting with the extremely popular Masterpiece Theater. Within just a couple of years, the company was running polls that showed consumers were starting to think of Mobil as the “thinking man’s oil company”. The company had less success, however, in convincing network TV stations. CBS and ABC refused to run visual versions of Mobil’s advertorials, saying they preferred to let their journalists cover issues of importance to the public. That response prompted Schmertz and Warner to go on a years-long campaign pushing the idea of corporate free speech and the need to protect it. In letters to TV executives and to newspaper editors, and speeches to various pro-business clubs, all obtained by the Guardian, the two oil executives make the argument repeatedly that protecting corporate free speech is tantamount to protecting democracy. Warner blamed environmentalists for the industry’s woes, and their need to speak out, in speeches to the Economic Clubs of Chicago and Detroit too. “We contend that the inherent limitations of broadcast news, especially time constraints, lack of expertise in energy, and programming formats, act against accurate and in-depth coverage of energy, and other complex, major issues,” Schmertz wrote to the CBS president, Arthur Taylor, in 1974. “The obligations of network news to the public go beyond fairness and objectivity. They should promote a free flow of information and opinion on major issues to the public.” The same year, in a talk at the annual convention of the Edison Electric Institute, which would go on to be a major purveyor of climate denial in the 1980s, Warner warned: “We are in no sense eager to stifle those who oppose us. On the contrary. We just want to be heard, too.” Robert Kerr, media law professor at the University of Oklahoma’s Gaylord College of Journalism and Mass Communication, has researched corporate free speech and Mobil’s role in crafting the idea for decades. “This whole argument that the corporate voice was being silenced is just the opposite of the truth,” he said. Kerr adds that by virtue of having more time, people and funding than any individual and most groups, corporations “could always get their views out better than the average person by manyfold”. Nonetheless, Schmertz and Warner sensed a threat in the 1970s. While Mobil never filed a case of its own to defend its “free speech” rights, it did begin filing amicus briefs in other corporate speech cases, and encouraging other pro-business advocates, like the US Chamber of Commerce, to do the same. The company also continued to regularly make the case in the court of public opinion via its weekly advertorials in the New York Times and its executives’ regular appearances on radio and TV. The work Mobil did to rile the business community up about corporate free speech in the 1970s culminated in the first big supreme court case on the matter, the precursor to Citizens United, First National Bank v Bellotti. The case became a precursor to the controversial Citizens United ruling in 2010, which opened the floodgates on corporate spending. In 1978, the court ruled that corporations could spend whatever money they wanted to in an effort to influence politics, overruling a Massachusetts statute that said otherwise. In the ruling, Justice Lewis A Powell said, “If the restricted view of corporate speech taken by the Massachusetts court were accepted, government would have the power to deprive society of the views of corporations.” Citizens United blurred the line between commercial speech – a marketing message from a company to the public – and political speech, which up until Citizens United was connected only to funding or speech backing a particular candidate or policy. Oil companies have been trying to obliterate that line for years, and their arguments in the current batch of climate cases are the latest effort. In Massachusetts this week, attorney Justin Anderson, a partner with Paul, Weiss, ExxonMobil’s law firm, argued that the state attorney general’s fraud complaint against Exxon was not valid because the company’s public statements on climate policy should be considered as political opinion, not misleading advertising – even when Exxon falsely claimed that climate change isn’t real. When asked why they would opt to file an anti-Slapp complaint rather than make a direct first amendment argument in court, Anderson made it clear that the point is to avoid discovery – the period of time in a civil case when corporations are asked to hand over files and make their executives available for depositions. “The anti-Slapp statute provides a mechanism to have a case that is brought against someone for petitioning activity dismissed at the outset before burdensome discovery is imposed on the party,” he argued. Legal observers believe that the oil companies’ response to the climate cases tees up the likelihood of the next big supreme court case on corporate first amendment rights. “They will try to defend their misinformation efforts as political speech covered by the first amendment and not subject to false advertising laws,” says Robert Brulle, an environmental sociologist who has co-authored briefs in some of these cases. Kerr agrees, although he notes that to side with the oil companies’ arguments in these cases, the supreme court would have to turn its back on about a century’s worth of legal precedent. “It’s really deeply established even by some of the members of the current supreme court, that the first amendment will never protect expression that is fraud,” he said. “The worry now is that with this court there seems to be a majority that wants to say yes to almost any question the corporate interests raise. And I hope I’m wrong about that. I hope this is a line they won’t cross.”",News/Environment,How oil companies rebranded deceptive climate ads as ‘free speech’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/oil-companies-corporate-free-speech-laws-climate-litigation

3/10/2022,"By Tuesday afternoon, Lyft driver Elida Zabaleta had earned $100 in the five hours she spent ferrying passengers across the city of San Jose. With gas prices in California surging, she’d have to use more than half of that to cover fuel for the day, leaving her with just $45. The rising cost of gas has made a difficult job all the more difficult, Zabaleta said, forcing her to spend more time behind the wheel to earn enough to afford living in one of the country’s most expensive cities. US gas prices have reached record highs in recent weeks, surging in part by the fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine after already having been high for months. California drivers are paying the most of any in the country, at an average of $5.57 a gallon, according to AAA. Rising prices are hitting gig workers particularly hard as fuel makes up a large part of their daily costs. Uber and Lyft drivers already struggling after the pandemic hit both wages and working conditions say paying more at the pump means they have to spend more time driving in order to achieve the same level of pay. Some are spending more than 60 hours a week working, and some say driving is simply no longer profitable. Zabaleta, who has driven for Lyft for two years, paid $5.20 a gallon to fill up this week. Meanwhile, factoring in the cost of gas, her income came out to about $9 an hour, far below San Jose’s $16.20 minimum wage. Zabaleta routinely spends as many as 50 hours a week behind the wheel, giving herself just one day off, and is working more to cover the increasing costs. Even before gas prices started rising, pay was becoming increasingly unpredictable driving for Lyft, she said. She previously drove five days a week, but with fewer passengers during the pandemic and fewer bonuses from Lyft, Zabaleta had to add an extra work day to her week in order to maintain the same level of income, she said. Companies such as Lyft aren’t doing enough to help drivers, she said. “This job should be something the worker should enjoy doing – this is a job that’s high risk and we’re putting our lives on the line everyday,” she said. Other drivers said that without increased wages or other support from rideshare companies to help alleviate the burden of fuel costs, driving will no longer be worthwhile. Rondu Gantt started working as a rideshare driver in the San Francisco Bay area in 2018 to supplement his income, but began driving full-time after his teaching job left him burnt out. Since then wages have only dropped, he said, and without the bonuses the companies offer, the job wouldn’t be profitable at all. “We’re at the point where we need the companies to pay bonuses every week just to make the job sustainable,” he said. The normal pay rate is too low, he said, so in addition to driving during the day, he routinely returns to the road at night when surge pricing is in effect. The expensive price of gas has made the job more challenging, Gantt said. “My costs are higher, my pay is the same, so I’m losing money. That’s a mathematical reality,” he said. Benjamin Valdez, who drives part-time for Uber and Lyft in Los Angeles and works as an organizer with Rideshare Drivers United, said he hasn’t driven for two weeks because of the high gas prices. When fuel costs go up, drivers stay out on the road for longer in order to try to make a profit, he said, which means there is more competition for rides. The loss in income is difficult for his family, Valdez said, but with gas prices as high as they are and more drivers out on the road, he’d be losing money driving. “I only drive when it’s profitable, which is few and far between right now,” he said. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has said he will propose a tax rebate to help the state’s drivers grapple with the increasing costs at the pump. Drivers are also hoping to see companies such as Lyft and Uber take steps to help support them amid the high prices, which experts say will likely continue for months. Organizers with Rideshare Drivers United are petitioning the rideshare companies to raise compensation and “set the rates fairly and equitably because of our increased costs”, said Daniel Russell, a part-time Uber driver and organizer with RDU. When asked if Lyft would offer additional support to drivers as fuel costs increase, Lyft spokesperson CJ Macklin said it had taken concrete steps to help, including a fuel cash-back program run in partnership with GetUpside. Macklin also said that US drivers are now seeing greater average hourly pay than they were a year ago, even with high fuel prices, as more riders return to the platform. Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Vitalii Konstantinov, who drives for Uber in San Diego and works with Rideshare Drivers United, said rising costs have forced him to dip into his family’s budget, and cancel a trip to Disneyland he had planned for his young children. He’s actively looking for other jobs. “It’s not worth driving for Uber anymore,” he said. Gantt said he’s also considering leaving the industry. “It is unsustainable for me to feel comfortable in this industry right now. I feel the vulnerability. I see how reliant I am on them to give me a bonus, I see how low the rate is,” he said. “I can’t work 16 hours every day. I’m gonna burn out. It’s physically demanding to be tired, drinking coffee, under-rested, and driving morning and night.”",News/US news,‘It’s not worth it’: rising gas prices force drivers to work for less than minimum wage,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/10/gig-workers-gas-prices-california-uber-lyft

Often considered the European Hawaii, with a strong volcanic presence, from black sand to geysers, the Azores are also known for their incredible hydrangeas, which frame houses and line roads and pathways all over the islands, and start flowering in spring. One of the central, smaller islands, Faial, boasts the largest collection of hydrangeas in varying shades of blue, so much so that it has the nickname Blue Island.Nadia, Aberdeen Norwich is a hidden gem in itself, but if you do venture east be sure to visit Eaton Park, covering 80 acres and designed by Captain Sandys-Winsch. Opened in May 1928 by the Prince of Wales, it is a perfectly wonderful place to enjoy the beauty of nature, especially in spring under a canopy of pink and white confetti from the most beautiful cherry trees in our county. There is so much else on offer too – domed bandstand, boating lake, lily pond, pitch and putt, miniature railway and formal gardens.Suze, Norwich The garden of Villa Bardini, in Florence, is not on most tourists’ must-see lists; and yet the blooming of its wisteria signals the beginning of spring for most Florentines. The long pergola on which the flowers rest leans into one of the most beautiful views of the city, framing it with Florence’s own colour, purple. I always find the scene to perfectly encapsulate the gracious beauty of the city, whose very name means “blooming”. You could write an entire history of the city through its flowers and gardens: the wisteria in Villa Bardini; the roses in the nearby Giardino delle Rose; and the wild, purple fleur-de-lys springing from the sides of the cobbled streets.Bianca Belli, London At whatever time of year you visit Bodnant Garden in north Wales’s Conwy Valley, there’s something colourful to see. But my favourites are flowering now: the large magnolia trees are truly magnificent, as are the hellebores. There are fields of daffodils alongside more formal landscaped terraced gardens and woodland glades. The gardens are famous for their rhododendron bushes and, in late spring, laburnum.Graham Dean, Heysham, Lancs Footsteps tread the winding path, adorned either side by an abundance of wildflowers. A wind whips through the alpine meadows, but the warmth holds in the Valencian hills. Rabaniza blanca (wall rocket) spreads like wildfire, under the blossoms of the late almond tree. A faint nutty aroma infiltrates the air, masking eager senses from a sombre seed. Two eagles circle above, glimmers of gold tainting their feathered coats in an aerial rendition through the southern skies. The bountiful Relleu valley thrives in this temperate climate, bearing hope and beauty with spring awakening – I say “muchas gracias for this rare fiesta”.Jenna Rainey, Bath Take a trip to Thriplow (silent “h”), eight miles south of Cambridge, and you will be greeted by hundreds of daffodils at every turn, arrays of yellow to brighten even the greyest spring day. Following a successful fundraiser for church roof repairs in 1969, the village holds an annual Daffodil Weekend, incorporating a country fair and raising money for local charities. This year it takes place on 19-20 March (£10 adult, £5 child, online tickets only). There is even a variety of daffodil named after the village – the Thriplow Gold.Sharon Pinner, Haslingfield, Cambridgeshire A strolling local, seeing me admiring the flowers in the Jardin des Tuileries last spring, advised me to take a short day trip to Giverny – the home and gardens of Claude Monet, which inspired his impressionist paintings. The scene was like Monet’s own canvas – climbing rose bushes, pink cherry trees, weeping willows and flowerbeds of dahlias, irises and wisteria.

3/10/2022,"The UK is to ease its rigid entry requirements for Ukrainian refugees, meaning those with passports can apply for entry online and only have to give biometric details when they are in the UK, Priti Patel has said. The home secretary’s announcement, responding to an urgent Commons question from her Labour shadow, Yvette Cooper, follows days of increasing criticism about the bureaucratic delays facing Ukrainians with family ties to the UK. Many have gone to Calais, to find out they could not apply for visas there, and were sent to other cities. A number of UK consular offices had very limited numbers of appointments. From Tuesday, Patel told the Commons, such appointments would no longer be needed for Ukrainian nationals with passports. They could apply remotely and would be told when they could travel. “In short, Ukrainians with passports will be able to get permission to come here fully online from wherever they are, and will be able to give their biometrics once in Britain,” she said. “This will mean that visa application centres across Europe can focus their efforts on helping Ukrainians without passports.” This will only be the case for people with passports, not ID cards, she said. Cooper welcomed the change, but castigated Patel for the system thus far, calling the treatment “a total, total disgrace, bringing shame onto our country”. “I have to say to the home secretary – why does it always take being hauled into the House of Commons to make basic changes to help vulnerable people who are fleeing from Ukraine?” Cooper said. Cooper queried why the changes were only being made now “when she has had intelligence for weeks, if not months, that she needed to prepare for a Russian invasion of Ukraine”, saying Patel should accept an offer of help from the armed forces. “It is deeply wrong to leave people in this terrible state,” Cooper said. “Our country is better than this. If she can’t get this sorted out, frankly she should hand the job over to somebody else who can.” In her statement, Patel defended the decision to make checks on Ukrainian nationals before they came, saying she had sought advice from the security services before making the change. Replying to Cooper, Patel insisted the government was taking a “pragmatic and agile approach” to visas. It was important for arrivals in the country to have proper documentation, she added, citing the Windrush scandal as an example of the problems that can otherwise occur. Patel has also come under increasing pressure over recent days from fellow Conservative MPs to speed up the visa process. Responding to her statement, a series of Tory backbenchers praised the change of stance but called for more to be done. One, Steve Baker, queried why a visa centre in Warsaw was closed from 5pm at weekdays, and all weekend, while former minister Robert Buckland asked her to better coordinate UK officials in the response, calling it “a crisis that will not wait”. While EU nations are allowing Ukrainian nationals to stay long-term without visas, the only routes to the UK are existing ones, either for people with family ties, or if they are sponsored by an individual or organisation.",News/Politics,"UK to ease entry requirements for Ukrainian refugees, says Priti Patel",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/10/uk-to-ease-entry-requirements-for-ukrainian-refugees-says-priti-patel
3/10/2022,"TikTok has blocked all non-Russian content in Russia but is allowing historical content uploaded by domestic accounts to stay online, including videos by state-backed media services. The Chinese-owned video sharing app said on Sunday it had banned livestreaming and uploading of new content in Russia after the Kremlin criminalised the spreading of what it deems to be fake news about its invasion of Ukraine. TikTok’s measures have extended to blocking all non-Russian content, meaning the only content Russian users can see is old videos uploaded by Russia-based accounts. Russian access to internet content from inside and outside Russia has been severely reduced by the Ukraine invasion. Facebook and Twitter have had their services blocked by the Russian communications regulator after the platforms pulled content from state-media backed news providers across Europe. Twitter has launched a privacy-protected version of its site to bypass surveillance and censorship. Tracking.exposed, an EU-based non-profit organisation that studies the profiling and tracking of internet users, described TikTok’s move as establishing a “splinternet” within a global social media platform. It said: “This is the first time that a global social media platform splits the content availability at such scale.” According to tracking.exposed, which used Russian IP addresses to attempt to access non-Russian TikTok content, the accounts of the World Health Organization and the popular TikToker Charli D’Amelio – who has 137.6 million followers – are among those inaccessible in Russia. On Sunday, TikTok said it did not want to put its Russian employees or users at risk of severe criminal penalties, as it described the service as a source of “relief and human connection during a time of war”. TikTok is the 10th most popular app in Russia. The app is now applying labels to some state-controlled media accounts, including in Russia, with content on accounts for state-owned news providers such as Tass now carrying the label “Russia state-controlled media”.",News/Technology,TikTok users in Russia can see only old Russian-made content,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/10/tiktok-users-in-russia-can-see-only-old-russian-made-content
3/10/2022,"Tui, Europe’s largest holiday company, has cancelled a deal allowing the Russian oligarch Alexei Mordashov to use its name after the billionaire was hit by EU sanctions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Tui Russia was established in 2009 as a joint venture with Mordashov’s Severgroup to expand the business in Russia and Ukraine. Mordashov had invested in Tui and joined its supervisory board but he was forced to resign last week after the sanctions were revealed. Tui had sold its stake in the joint venture at the end of March 2021 to KN-Holdings LLC, a company then wholly owned and controlled by Mordashov’s sons, Kirill and Nikita. However, Mordashov recently took back control of the company. The brand licence agreement allowed Tui Russia to continue using the name in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. It is thought that the Russian business is planning to announce a new brand name as soon as Thursday. Fritz Joussen, the chief executive of Tui Group, said: “Tui condemns Russia’s attack and war against Ukraine. Our position is clear. The Tui brand must no longer be used by Tui Russia for its business and the company’s presence.” Tui’s links with Mordashov have come under close scrutiny since the invasion of Ukraine, and Italian authorities last week reportedly seized a 65m yacht said to belong to him. Mordashov controls about a third of Tui’s shares via different investment vehicles. Mordashov’s shares in Tui have been frozen, meaning he cannot sell them to realise any profits. He also resigned from Tui’s board as soon as the sanctions were announced. Mordashov, one of Russia’s richest men, owns Severgroup, which includes the vast Severstal steel producer and a Tui stake. The EU’s announcement of sanctions on Mordashov said he was, through Severgroup’s banking, media and industrial interests, “responsible for supporting actions and policies that undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine”. In a statement on Monday, Mordashov said he had “absolutely nothing to do with the emergence of the current geopolitical tension” and did not understand why the EU had imposed sanctions on him.
