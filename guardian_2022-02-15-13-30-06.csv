2/15/2022,"The Morrison government is gearing up for a national security election, daring Labor to vote for a bill that would allow it to deport permanent visa holders for low-level offending and amping up its rhetoric on “appeasement” of China. In caucus Labor reserved its position on the strengthening character test bill – which it previously helped defeat in the Senate – ahead of a lower house vote on Wednesday, which Scott Morrison claimed would prove whether Labor was “on the side of criminals”.  Anthony Albanese told caucus that “every government scare campaign has blown up in their face”. Earlier, Morrison told 2GB Radio the government’s efforts to deport criminals were “being frustrated by soft decisions in the courts” as judges “haven’t given a higher sentence because they’ve, they fear that they’ll lose their visa”. The prime minister was referring to the orthodox sentencing principle that judges may take into account penalties other than the one handed down by the court, such as visa cancellation and deportation. Morrison said if people have committed crimes “they have breached every single obligation they have to the country that gave them a visa” and should not be able to use “loopholes” to stay. The bill lowers the bar for automatic failure of the character test, making it more likely people convicted of low-grade offences will have their visas cancelled although the minister already has the power to do so. On 10 February Labor’s immigration spokesperson, Kristina Keneally, wrote to her counterpart, Alex Hawke, noting Labor had supported mandatory cancellation of visas for those actually sentenced to 12 months or more for serious crimes and arguing the existing powers are fit-for-purpose. Guardian Australia understands Keneally reiterated Labor’s concerns: that low-level offending should not be a trigger for deportation, retrospective application should be removed, and a ministerial direction should be issued to soften the impact on New Zealand citizens. The government does not intend to negotiate on these points, meaning Labor’s final position will be decided by the party’s leadership group with Keneally and the assistant immigration shadow minister, Andrew Giles. Earlier, Morrison pointed to Russia’s military buildup on the border with Ukraine and declared it was “not a time for weakness”. “I don’t flinch on these things,” he told radio 2SM. “In the mettle department, there’s plenty there.” The head of Asio, Mike Burgess, issued an implicit rebuke of the government on Monday night when he declared that his intelligence agency was “not here to be politicised” and he would have conversations with ministers, parliamentarians or staff if he felt intelligence had been misused. The comments came days after the defence minister, Peter Dutton, said he based Thursday’s inflammatory allegation that the Chinese government had picked Albanese “as their candidate” on “open source and other intelligence” he saw. Burgess told the Senate committee he “deliberately chose not to identify the election, jurisdiction, party, the individuals that were targets, or the country attempting to conduct the interference”. That, the Asio chief said, was because attempts at foreign interference were “not confined to one side of politics” and were being seen “at all levels of government, in all states and territories”. A Labor senator, Kimberley Kitching, under the protection of parliamentary privilege, named Chinese-Australian property developer Chau Chak Wing, who has previously been a major donor to both major parties. “I am reliably informed that the puppeteer mentioned in your case study in your annual threat assessment speech given last week is Chau Chak Wing,” Kitching told Burgess at the Senate hearing, asking him to confirm it. Burgess replied that he would not comment on “speculation” about identities “and it’s unfair you ask me that question in public”. Labor’s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, declined to say whether it was appropriate for Kitching to name the alleged puppeteer – but he accused Dutton of “unhinged and ridiculous commentary” that did “the bidding of people who want to do us ill”. Labor’s deputy leader, Richard Marles, also bristled at the government’s line of attack, after the Liberal senator James Paterson criticised him over a speech in Beijing in 2019 saying it would be “a profound mistake” to “define China as an enemy”. Marles said on Tuesday while the government was “big on rhetoric” and “likes to beat its chest”, it had failed to “build our hard power” to deal with “the most complex set of strategic circumstances facing our nation since the end of the second world war”. The former prime minister Kevin Rudd said on Tuesday, the government was telling “rancid lies” about Labor’s approach to China and he could not “sit back, be silent and allow lies and this hypocrisy to remain uncontested”. Rudd said the federal election campaign should be “conducted on the basis of the facts” rather than “the fiction and hypocrisy we’ve been served up by Field Marshal Dutton”. The former Labor prime minister said Liberal party figures had previously made supportive comments about an extradition treaty with China, questioned Labor’s ban on Huawei’s involvement in the National Broadband Network, and criticised a speech Rudd as prime minister had made in Beijing raising human rights concerns. Rudd said on the Coalition’s watch, the Northern Territory government granted a 99-year lease of the Port of Darwin to a Chinese company in what he labelled an “abrogation of the national interest”. “I don’t intend to stand idly by while Peter Dutton smears the party of which I’ve been parliamentary leader, prime minister, and could form the next government of Australia as being somehow soft on China,” Rudd said. Comment has been sought from Dutton and Kitching and the home affairs minister, Karen Andrews. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, brushed off Morrison’s complaint that Beijing had been “chillingly silent” on the Russian troop buildup near Ukraine’s border. At a daily press conference in Beijing on Monday, Wang said the Australian government should “abandon the cold war mentality and ideological bias and stop making belligerent rhetoric that will escalate the tensions”.",News/Australia news,Coalition tries to set up showdown with Labor on deporting criminals,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/15/coalition-tries-to-set-up-showdown-with-labor-on-deporting-criminals
2/15/2022,"Intelligence that linked the Manchester Arena bomber to another suspected terrorist was uncovered by detectives three years before the 2017 bombing but was never passed on for further investigation, an inquiry has heard. Detectives found the name, photo and phone number of Salman Abedi during an investigation into Abdalraouf Abdallah in 2014.  They found Abedi had exchanged about 1,300 text messages with Abdallah in November 2014. In one message, Abedi wrote: “By Allah … every day, on every kneeling I ask my Lord for martyrdom.” Abedi also described non-Muslims as “dogs” and “kuffars” – a derogatory Arabic term for unbelievers – and shared an image of the currency used by Islamic State in Syria, “not under control of the west”. Abedi was named only as “Salman” in Abdallah’s phone. On Monday, Frank Morris, a former senior investigating officer at North West Counter Terrorism Policing (NWCTP) who found the text messages, told the inquiry into the bombing that the intelligence should have been passed on for “development” but was not. The text messages were only traced back to Abedi after he killed 22 people and injured hundreds more when he detonated a suicide vest at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017. The inquiry has previously heard intelligence was received by MI5 about Abedi in the months before the bombing but was assessed at the time to relate to possibly non-terrorist criminality. In retrospect this intelligence was highly relevant to the planned attack, the inquiry has been told. Morris said there was nothing extraordinary in Abedi’s text exchanges with Abdallah, who was convicted and jailed for terrorism offences in 2016 after being at the centre of a network that helped British Muslim men travel to Syria or Libya to fight. Morris said, however, that more should have been done to establish Abedi’s identity. He told the inquiry: “It went to the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service], they did not ask. Nobody ever asked who this Salman was. So with hindsight, of course it should have been put in, but at the time I did not think it should have been.” The inquiry was told “modest policing efforts” would have identified who “Salman” was and officers could have referred him to the Prevent programme for deradicalisation or for further investigation. Morris said four or five people, including detectives, intelligence analysts and himself, were aware of the information but did not flag it up for further inquiries. The “Salman” exchanges were among 14,500 contacts on the phone and Morris said that at that time in 2014 he was personally running 10 to 14 operations and the counter-terror unit up to 110 separate investigations. He said: “At that time this was commonplace and I know I keep saying it, this was not unusual. That’s the issue with intelligence – it’s very subjective.” Sir John Saunders, the chair of the inquiry, said that had police linked the phone number of Salman with his identity, this information could have “informed future decisions”.",News/UK news,"Police had intel on Manchester Arena bomber years before attack, inquiry told",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/14/police-intel-manchester-arena-bomber-years-before-attack-inquiry-told-salman-abedi-text-messages
