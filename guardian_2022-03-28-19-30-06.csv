3/28/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s full-blown invasion of Ukraine aimed at toppling the Kyiv government – based on the preposterous claim that it’s run by “neo-Nazis” – has produced Europe’s worst war in a generation, and it has taken a terrible toll on civilians. The Russian armed forces have hit hospitals, apartment buildings, a shopping center and a theater that was serving as a shelter. The immense suffering has been made worse by sieges, above all the one around Mariupol, large parts of which have also been reduced to rubble. The war has also forced millions from their homes. The UN high commissioner for refugees reports that more than 3.7 million Ukrainians have fled their homeland and that another 6.7 million have been internally displaced. The two figures together – children account for nearly half the total – comprise 20% of Ukraine’s population. The shock and outrage at these and other dreadful consequences of Putin’s invasion are understandable, indeed appropriate. Animus toward Putin and the desire to make him pay a steep price, without delay, are running deep in the west, so much so that some believe that war cannot end so long as he remains in power. Some American foreign policy specialists welcomed the prospects of regime change in Russia, while others opined that it should be the objective of US policy – or said so only to backpedal once critics weighed in. Not one for subtlety, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina declared that the war in Ukraine won’t end until someone in Russia decides to “take this guy out” and followed up by saying that the only solution was for Russians to “rise up” and, referring to the 2011 uprisings in the Arab world, create a “Russian spring”. Carl Bildt, a former prime minister and foreign minister of Sweden, averred that peace in Europe requires regime change in Russia. Although the Biden administration has disavowed regime change, its direct appeals to the Russian people are an obvious attempt to turn them against their government. President Biden’s off-script remark, during a visit to Poland following the 24 March Nato summit, that Putin “cannot remain in power” gave rise to speculation about his Russia policy and left his team scrambling to explain that toppling Putin was in fact not one of its goals. Protests in Russia against Putin’s war, criticisms of it by prominent Russian tycoons and celebrities, and growing evidence that western economic sanctions are making Russians’ quotidian life much harder – because of shortages of basic necessities and rising prices – may strengthen the belief that this is the moment to bring Putin, and perhaps even his authoritarian political system, down. Let’s assume for a moment that Putin does fall. What happens next? One possibility: a new authoritarian leader replaces him, winds down the war in Ukraine in order to save Russia’s economy from disaster, and eventually seeks to repair the rupture with the west. Yet any successor to Putin who emerges from Russia’s current political order is more likely to share his animus toward Nato, and the west more generally, as well as his proprietorial attitude toward Ukraine. He –it’s certain to be a man – may continue the war, using different tactics, for fear that a defeat could imperil his position even before he has time to solidify it. A second outcome might be that Russians, weary of the war and enraged by the economic pain created by western sanctions, rise up and overthrow their government, eventually clearing a path to democracy. But a rebellion could fail, so those who hope for this result must ask themselves if it’s responsible to encourage a mass revolt when they are in no position to protect protestors from the massive repressive machinery at Putin’s disposal. There’s a third plausible scenario. Unrest in Russia segues into prolonged chaos, even a civil war pitting those who have a huge stake in the survival of the existing political order against their opponents who want to consign it to history’s rubbish heap. That could produce political turmoil, bloodletting, and a disarray in the world’s only other nuclear superpower – one that extends from Europe to the Pacific Ocean, has an area nearly twice that of the United States and land borders with 14 countries. Theories of nuclear stability have always assumed that the countries that deter one another remain stable. We have no conceptual framework for understanding, let alone experience coping with, anarchy in a nuclear-armed country. Can proponents of regime change in Russia be certain that the denouement will be the one they have in mind and are confident about? The dismal record of the United States and its allies in predicting the results of the regime changes they precipitated – in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya – are grounds for caution, not least because the consequences of getting this particular attempt wrong might prove disastrous.

3/28/2022,"In the example clues below, I explain the two parts of each one: there is a definition of the answer and there is some wordplay – a recipe for assembling its letters. In a genuine puzzle environment, of course, you also have the crossing letters, which hugely alleviate your solving load. Hence “crossword”. Also, the setters’ names tend to link to profiles of the individuals behind the pseudonyms. A crossword setter sometimes wants you to take the letter at the end of one of the clue’s words to make up part of the answer. Slightly more often, you are looking for the letter at the beginning of a word. And slightly less often – as you have probably guessed – you want the letter in the middle. Here’s Pan: 31a Celebrity holding middle of musical instrument (5) So we take a word for celebrity (STAR), and make it “hold” the middle of the word “musical” (I), which gives us our instrument: SITAR. It takes a moment to realise that “musical” belongs to the wordplay and not to the definition, and that kind of ambiguity is why we do these things. It’s not always “middle of”. Here’s Paul: 24a Name a character in the centre of big Gulf state (5) This is a synonym for “name” (as a verb: DUB); the clue’s “a” becomes the answer’s A … and then “character in the centre of big” gives us an I: the Gulf state we’re looking for is DUBAI. When Paul says “character in the centre of”, he is simultaneously being utterly explicit about making us look for a central letter and appearing to describe something else entirely. A word that solvers rapidly get used to interpreting as “take the middle letter” is one that directs you to the core – or perhaps the essence – of a word. An example from a setter who is a heart surgeon when he is not creating puzzles, Philistine: 21a Sad lover’s essentially missing you (7) So we make an anagram (“sad”) of the word LOVERS, add the middle of “missing” and we get SOLVERS (that’s “you”). Setters are prone to talking directly to us, and to referring to themselves. What if the word we’re pinching letters from has an even number of letters, and no single “character” in the middle? That’s what’s going on in this one from Anto: 5d Girl from the middle of Panama becoming saint (5) The middles of “Panama”, “becoming” and “saint” give us NA, OM and I, so our girl is NAOMI. Can this trick be played with more than two letters? It can. Again, here’s Pan: 21a Essentially miserable time? (3) The essence of “miserable” is ERA, our time. And if you think this kind of thing is going on, but the middle of some word isn’t offering much that’s interesting, perhaps we’re looking for the middle of a sequence of words. So it is with Otterden … 6d Refuse to acknowledge central role in public utility (3) … where we take the middle of “public utility” for the socially snubbing act, the CUT. Seasoned solvers: do you have any favourite examples or other ways of doing this? Beginners: any questions? In the meantime, here’s Philistine again with a devilish clue that reverses the principle we’ve been talking about. 1d Clue for hotel in remote location?

3/28/2022,"Good morning. Ukraine is willing to discuss “neutral status” at face-to-face talks with Russia in Turkey, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. “Our goal is obvious – peace and the restoration of normal life in our native state as soon as possible,” the Ukrainian president said in a late-night video message that also set out his negotiating red lines. “Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt. Effective security guarantees for our state are mandatory.” He used a video interview with independent Russian media outlets to signal his willingness to discuss the idea of Ukraine adopting a “neutral status”, and also make compromises about the status of the eastern Donbas region, in order to secure a peace agreement with Russia. Several rounds of talks have already failed to end the war sparked by the Russian invasion, which is now in its second month. What else did he say? Zelenskiy said he was not willing to discuss demilitarisation, and said Ukrainians would need to vote in a referendum to approve their country adopting a neutral status. What about international diplomacy? The French president has cautioned against verbal escalations after the US is forced to deny it is seeking regime change. What else is happening? Here’s everything we know on day 33 of the Russian invasion. Coda has been named this year’s best picture at an Oscars ceremony that featured an unexpected confrontation between Will Smith and Chris Rock. The Apple TV+ drama, bought from 2021’s Sundance film festival for a record-breaking $25m, became the first movie from a streamer to win the award. It’s a remake of the French film La Famille Bélier, focusing on the only hearing member of a deaf family. Will Smith had the night’s most viral moment with Chris Rock after the comedian made a joke about his wife Jada Pinkett Smith’s shaved head, saying he was looking forward to GI Jane 2. Pinkett Smith, who revealed last year that she had alopecia, was unamused and an angered Smith then came on to the stage and slapped Rock before the sound muted. Footage later showed that Rock said: “Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me” before Smith shouted: “Get my wife’s name out of your fucking mouth.” How did Hollywood react to the incident? Reactions to the most talked-about moment of the Oscars ranged from delight to concern. What else happened? The eventful 94th Academy Awards ceremony delivered drama in spades. Here are some of the standout moments. It was also an historic night for women. Who else won? Here’s a full list of all the Oscar winners. Behind closed doors in a nondescript conference room at the foot of Capitol Hill, the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack next week expects to hear testimony about the connections between the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys militia groups and the Capitol attack, writes Hugo Lowell. The panel expects to hear how the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys coordinated their plans and movements in the days before the insurrection to the same level of detail secured by the justice department and referenced in recent prosecutions for seditious conspiracy. And the select committee hopes to also hear in the 5 April deposition – arranged by a senior counsel for the panel – private conversations between the leaders of the two militia groups and whether they might have communicated with any Trump advisers. The expected testimony and materials represent another significant breakthrough for the investigation and could play a major role in establishing for the select committee whether Donald Trump oversaw a criminal conspiracy as part of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Will the Capitol attack panel question Ginni Thomas? Republicans have refused to reveal whether the panel intends to question Ginni Thomas – wife of the US supreme court justice Clarence Thomas – over reports of her urging the White House to overturn Trump’s election defeat. Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, the husband and wife musicians who were core members of Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club, have survived a serious car crash after a collision with a drunk driver. Frantz posted an image of their wrecked Ford SUV on Facebook and described their injuries. The US was about to set the Taliban on the path to diplomatic recognition before the plan was derailed by the Afghan rulers’ sudden U-turn on a promise to allow girls’ education. A joint event had been planned before the Doha forum that would have set the process in motion to grant the group diplomatic recognition. The former bishop of the Roman Catholic diocese of Albany, New York, has acknowledged covering up allegations of sexual abuse against children by priests in part to avoid scandal and protect the reputation of the diocese. Howard Hubbard made the admission during a deposition taken last year. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has sought to reassure Israel and its Gulf allies that Iran will never acquire atomic weapons, before the possible renewal of the nuclear deal with Tehran. “When it comes to the most important element, we see eye to eye,” Blinken said. Shanghai will launch a phased lockdown to curb an Omicron-fuelled Covid-19 outbreak that has hit China with its highest caseloads since the early days of the pandemic, the city government said. China’s biggest city, with a population of 25 million people, will lock down its eastern half from Monday until Friday, officials have said, followed by a similar lockdown of its western side from 1 April. Meanwhile, Covid has helped China tighten its hold on Hong Kong. Here’s how. Like most Americans, Evan followed the widespread media coverage of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor’s deaths in 2020. And like many Black Americans, he experienced traumatic-stress symptoms. Debilitating panic attacks incapacitated him multiple times a day and insomnia drained his meager remaining energy.

Nicknamed the “Einstein of energy efficiency”, Amory Lovins, sees Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine as an outrage but possibly also a step towards solving the climate crisis and a way to save trillions of dollars. “He has managed to bring about all the outcomes that he most feared, but he may inadvertently have put the energy transition and climate solutions into a higher gear. Whether or not we end up in a recession because of the disruption, [Putin’s war] may prove to be a great thing for climate economics.” If you’ve been watching any of the big American TV series recently, you may have noticed some new members in the cast, writes Nell Frizzell.

3/28/2022,"Sacred Native American sites such as the Grand Canyon and Bears Ears may seem a long way from the devastation unfolding in Ukraine. But as the US mulls a ban on Russian uranium, part of economic levers to stop Putin’s war, Indigenous communities living near US mines could pay the price. John Barrasso, a senator from Wyoming, recently introduced a bill that calls for a ban on all forms of uranium imported from Russia. Uranium fuels America’s nuclear power plants, and about 20% of that comes from Russia, while close to another 30% is imported from the Russian allies of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Such a ban would shift American uranium production into overdrive. In an editorial in the Casper Star Tribune, Barrasso pointed out that the US has “vast uranium resources”, including in Wyoming, but 90% of the uranium used in nuclear power plants is imported. “Rather than letting our uranium sit in the ground, we ought to use it,” he wrote. A longtime advocate of the uranium industry, Barrasso also wrote that continuing to buy Russian uranium was funding “Putin’s killing machine”. Mining companies now stand at the ready, with the possibility to ramp up production at sites near the Grand Canyon, Bears Ears national monument in Utah and at multiple locations in Barrasso’s home state of Wyoming. Many of the operations pose environmental and spiritual threats to Indigenous communities who live near the mines and have fought their existence for decades. Amber Reimondo, the energy director of the not-for-profit Grand Canyon Trust, says the Senate’s proposal risks “perpetuating environmental injustices on our own soil”. “If this ban is aimed at saving lives, the answer can’t just be to ramp up US uranium production,” Reimondo says. “The answer has to involve truly respecting and listening to communities on the front lines of uranium production, especially Indigenous communities … Otherwise, this is not about protecting human life. It is about protecting profits.” When the cold war began in the late 1940s, the federal government started a uranium boom in the US by offering generous incentives to private mining companies and guaranteeing a purchase price for ore. By the mid-1950s, more than 750 mines were in operation, mostly in and around Native American reservations in the south-west where there were rich uranium deposits. Until 1971, the US government was the primary purchaser of uranium as it built up its military arsenal. Many Native Americans worked in the mines, which were poorly regulated and offered few safety protections for employees or the environment. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, cheap uranium flooded the global market, which effectively shut down the more expensive US uranium mining operations. But with imported uranium prices on the rise after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – up from $17 a pound in 2017 to nearly $60 a pound in the last few days – domestic mining companies see a unique opportunity. Denver-based Energy Fuels Resources, the second largest uranium producer in the United States, told investors in mid-March that the war in Ukraine could improve the company’s bottom line. “With the recent events in Ukraine, security of supply in US of uranium is crucial,” said Mark Chalmers, the company’s president and CEO, in a webcast. He added that for the first time in years the suddenly favorable business environment has made it possible to pursue uranium sales contracts with “pricing and terms that return acceptable project margins”. According to Energy Fuels spokesperson Curtis Moore, the company has a total of six uranium mining facilities in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming that are fully permitted and licensed, and could go into production pending a viable sales arrangement with a nuclear utility. Pinyon Plain mine (formerly called Canyon Mine) has been waiting for such a moment for 35 years. Although the company has built most of the mine’s infrastructure and obtained all the permits, not a pound of ore has ever been extracted because uranium prices have remained too low. The mine occupies 17 acres on Kaibab national forest, nine miles from the South Rim of Grand Canyon and three miles from Red Butte. The rust-colored landmark rising from the Coconino Plateau is the spiritual center for the Havasupai people who have lived in the Grand Canyon for more than 800 years. The 754-member tribe has been fighting the mine since it was first permitted in 1986. In addition to fears about environmental and health hazards, there are also significant spiritual harms caused by the mine that tribal members say are devastating but have been dismissed by federal courts, the mining company and government regulatory agencies. “We have a belief system that they don’t understand,” says Havasupai elder Carletta Tilousi who has been involved in fighting the mine for decades and also serves on Joe Biden’s White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council. “In our stories, that area where the mine is located is mother Earth’s lungs. So when they dug the mine shaft, they punctured her lungs.” In 2016, Energy Fuels completed digging a 1,400ft deep mine shaft. The operation inadvertently pierced an aquifer that has continuously flooded the mine shaft ever since. Some 40m gallons of water with high levels of uranium and arsenic have been managed on the site, where a lined pond holds the water before it is sprayed into the air to evaporate. Environmentalists and the Havasupai argue that the toxic water could eventually make its way into a deep aquifer that supplies the tribe’s drinking water and feeds springs in Grand Canyon national park. If the mine begins extracting uranium ore, the possibility for contamination will become exponentially greater. When asked about the controversy over Pinyon Plain mine and its potential impact on Indigenous communities, Moore attributed the negative claims to environmental groups. “There are some activists who like to spread a lot of misinformation about groundwater pollution or air pollution,” he said. “But it’s just not true.” Reimondo points out that even if Energy Fuels is currently not in violation of regulations from the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, the water coming out of the mine shaft still contains levels of uranium and arsenic that is some 30 times the amount considered safe by the EPA for drinking water. And there is always the possibility that the pond holding all that water could spring a leak. “The risk of an accident is theoretical with regulators until it actually happens,” says Reimondo. The ore extracted from Pinyon Plain mine would be trucked to Energy Fuels’ White Mesa Mill, a processing facility in southeastern Utah adjacent to the Ute Mountain Ute community and near Bears Ears National Monument. As the only operational uranium mill in the United States, White Mesa’s processing business is likely to significantly increase with more domestic uranium production. The 40-year old mill also produces uranium by extracting it from industrial wastes, and stores leftover radioactive material on site. Like the Havasupai, the Ute Mountain Ute are worried their drinking water could be contaminated by the mill. And they are afraid to gather traditional plants in the area or even let their children play outside when the air smells bad. In August 2021, the tribe passed a resolution declaring that White Mesa Mill should be closed in order to protect the health of the community. But that request has not been acted upon by Utah government officials. “How can we make sure tribal members can get clean drinking water when radioactive waste is just a few miles away?” asks Manuel Heart, the Ute Mountain Ute tribal chairman. Industry representatives counter that fears about uranium mining operations are misguided and based on bad practices from the cold war era rather than the modern technologies used today. “All the mines that would respond to this current demand have gone through the gauntlet of permitting with very high US standards,” says Scott Melbye, president of the trade group Uranium Producers of America. “The United States can do it a lot better, safer and cleaner than developed countries who don’t care about the environment or aboriginal communities. We are the world leaders for 21st century mining practices in terms of health and safety.” However, Reimondo of Grand Canyon Trust points out that health and safety regulations only focus on monitoring during a short time period, while exposed uranium can pose an environmental hazard for hundreds or thousands of years. The Pinyon Plain mine is anticipated to have an operational life of four to seven years followed by a post-closure monitoring program lasting seven years. “The threat of a uranium mine doesn’t end when it closes,” she says. “In fact, that might be the start of the real threat because nobody is there anymore.” Hundreds of abandoned uranium mines remain on the Navajo reservation from operations spanning the 1950s to the 1980s when the US military built up its cold war arsenal. Cancer caused by contaminated ground water is common on the reservation and an ongoing recent study by the University of New Mexico found that many Navajo women and their babies have high levels of radioactive metal in their systems. Uncertainty remains as to whether the uranium ban will come to fruition. According to Senator Barrasso’s spokesperson, the bill has not yet been scheduled for a committee hearing but “he will look for every opportunity to pass it into law”. And although Biden banned imports of Russian oil, gas and coal, he has not announced any policies regarding Russian uranium. Regardless, the Havasupai, who call themselves “the guardians of the Grand Canyon,” are ready to fight. “You may have taken the ground from underneath us but we are still here,” says Tilousi. “We are a small tribe with a very big voice.”",News/US news,‘Ready to fight’: how a Russian uranium ban would threaten Native American tribes,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/28/native-americans-ban-russian-uranium
3/28/2022,"The glass door is propped open. It has a branch painted on it, also a barrel and grapes. It is midday, so the glass-fronted counter is full, its metal trays of vegetables with spoons poised like runners on a starting line. There is chicory, well-cooked romanesco cauliflower, cubes of sweet-and-sour aubergine, grilled red peppers, courgettes with breadcrumbs, artichoke frittata, cheese and various salami. To the right of the cash desk is the mirrored credenza da vino, or wine cupboard, its four taps ready to fill glass flasks of various sizes: litre, half, quarter. A group of regulars sit on the tables nearest the counter, chatting about Gualtieri, the mayor of Rome. The atmosphere, while different in many ways, reminds me deeply of my Granny’s pub. The place is called Fraschetta da Sandro; the eponymous Sandro is gentle and he asks what we want, then tells us to sit down at one of the tables and he will bring it over.In Lazio, the origins of the word fraschetta are related to the ancient hamlet of Frascata (now Frascati), so called because local woodcutters built huts from frasche (branches). Subsequently, local winemakers adopted a medieval custom common all over Italy of hanging a frasca, a branch, often of laurel, over the door to tell people they could buy or drink wine inside. These branched marked places became known as fraschette. There was no food, except maybe bread and boiled eggs, so people brought their own. In the cluster of towns known as Castelli Romani – Frascati, Marino, Ariccia – stalls serving thick slices of porchetta are inextricably linked with fraschette, some of which remain unchanged. Others evolved, and the new generation of fraschette in cities took their own shape, food becoming common – cheese, salumi, vegetables cooked and pickled, and bread, obviously, although wine remains the reason. A quarter of white wine arrives at the table, as well as a plate of mixed vegetables, some bread, fingers of cheese fanned out like the sun, and a frittata. This week’s recipe is inspired by that. Also by a bunch, rather than a branch, of spring onions, the green bits for frittata, the bulbs for a pan with water, sugar and vinegar, where they are simmered until they are soft and surrounded in agrodolce (sweet-and-sour syrup). Serve the frittata and sticky onions with bread, cheese and a litre, half, quarter or sospiro (a “sigh”, or a 20ml flask) of wine. Prep 5 minCook 30 minServes 4 2 bunches spring onions (ie, about 12)Olive oil2 tbsp brown sugar2 tbsp red-wine vinegarButter8 eggs2 tbsp grated parmesanSalt and black pepper100g soft goat’s cheese (optional) Cut the bulbs from the green tops of the spring onions. Carefully trim the rooty base of the bulbs, making sure there is still enough intact that they stay whole. If they are large, cut in half through the root; if smaller, leave whole. To make the sweet-and-sour onions, warm a little oil in a small pan, add all but two of the onion bulbs and stir for a few minutes. Sprinkle over the sugar, then add the vinegar and four tablespoons of water, and bring to a lively simmer. Reduce to a light simmer and cook, stirring often, for 20 minutes. By the end of cooking, the bulbs should be soft and surrounded by sweet and sour syrup. To make the frittata, warm a couple of tablespoons of olive oil and a little butter in a nonstick pan over a medium-low heat. Finely dice the two remaining spring onion bulbs, add these to the pan with the onion greens, cook gently until soft and wilted, then tip on to a plate. In a bowl, whisk the eggs with the parmesan, salt and pepper, add the softened onion bulbs (not the greens) and whisk again. Heat a little butter in a nonstick pan, add the egg mixture, then arrange the wilted onion greens and blobs of goat’s cheese (if using) on the surface. Cook over a gentle heat for 10 minutes. I invert the frittata on to a plate, then slip it. back into the pan to finish the other side, which is slightly messy, but I prefer the finish. Alternatively, do so under the grill.

3/28/2022,"Just like in many horror films that have come before, a trip to the countryside goes terribly awry in Sebastian Godwin’s feature debut. Taken to an imposing mansion on isolated land, Holly (Aisling Loftus) is nervous about meeting the mother and the children of her new husband Richard (Tom Goodman-Hill). To make matters worse, on their arrival Richard’s estranged ex-wife is nowhere to be found on the sprawling property. Meanwhile, the children begin to behave strangely: locked doors and the eerie rustling of trees hint at a frightening secret to which only the children have the key. There is nothing wrong with reviving well-worn genre tropes, and Homebound’s setting does vaguely recall the pleasures of spooky British TV classics such as The Owl Service. Still, as the plot is fairly simple, the lack of visual style and attention, and consequent failure to craft a suspenseful atmosphere, is especially glaring. The soundscape is also a disappointment, oscillating between repetitive noise-making and screeching string music. The effort to evoke psychological unease entails simply having the children doing weird things, like burying a doll in the depth of the woods, and shooting them with such pedestrian nondescriptness that the characters might as well be drinking a glass of water. Unsupported by the script, Goodman-Hill delivers the occasional flash of a good performance, as the film gradually evolves into a portrait of family trauma. Nevertheless, this is not enough to save Homebound: running a little bit over an hour, it feels like an underdeveloped short that has overstayed its welcome.

3/28/2022,"In 2019, Imogen was working as a freelance musician and studying sound art when she stumbled on a new hobby. “I was inspired to try out bellringing after speaking to a friend,” she says. “I didn’t have any expectations, but I was really interested in the bells and wanted to see what it was like.” In September, she went to a church in Hackney, London, to join a local bellringing group. She followed the spiral staircase to the bell tower, where people were gathered in different patterns. There, she spotted Aine, who had been taking part for several years. “It’s mostly older people, so you notice when someone younger comes in,” says Aine. “Because it can get quite crowded in the tower, you end up perched on the edges. When Imogen arrived, I accidentally dropped my water on her, which was embarrassing. Luckily, it broke the ice.” Over the next few weeks, they began meeting up regularly at bellringing sessions, or going for drinks with the rest of the group. “We got on well, but I’d seen a lot of people come and go, so I wasn’t sure if I wanted to invest in the friendship,” says Aine. One Sunday morning, in early 2020, Imogen offered to walk Aine home after bellringing. “Imogen should have been going in the opposite direction, but it was clear we wanted to spend more time talking.” They soon became good friends and went for coffee together every weekend. When Covid hit, Imogen moved out of the shared warehouse where she was living in north London and went to stay with her parents in Suffolk. During lockdown, the friendship continued to blossom. “We spoke every day. I showed her around the countryside, where I grew up, via video calls,” says Imogen. “We’d watch movies together on Zoom and had this amazing, long-distance friendship.” In June, Imogen returned to London and they arranged to meet up. “By this time, I think I knew I had stronger feelings, but it hadn’t really crystallised in my mind,” says Aine. “I’d been out as gay for a long time, but I thought Imogen was straight and it was just a friendship.” They met up and shared a pizza before taking a walk by the canal. “For me, it felt like there was this shift and we were taking this very natural, organic step from friends to something more,” says Imogen. “I was falling for a woman and it made me fully realise my sexuality, something I’d known deep down for a while.” Although she had begun to feel a spark, she wasn’t certain Aine felt the same way. “I was so nervous,” she says. Eventually, she confessed her feelings. “After that, we started dating and spending more time together,” says Aine. “Because of the Covid restrictions, we’d go for outdoor picnics. She was always bringing me plastic containers full of dal she’d made.” They both had a few health problems that summer and made several trips to A&E together. “We got through it, and stayed happy, even though it was early in our relationship,” says Aine. “On one occasion, I’d had an accident and hurt my head – but I remember laughing so much with Imogen, even when I was getting my head glued together.” That autumn, Imogen came out to her family, who were very supportive. Navigating their relationship over the next few months of lockdowns was another challenge, but they were determined to make things work. “We formed bubbles and saw each other when we could,” says Aine. “Imogen was able to be with my family at Christmas, too.” In October 2021, the couple moved in together in west London. Aine is a PhD student, while Imogen studies law and works part-time in sales. “Someone from the bellringing community actually helped to find us our flat,” says Imogen. “It’s been a really important part of our lives and it was what brought us together.” Aine says her partner’s empathy makes her stand out. “Imogen is so emotionally in tune. She’s also this incredibly vibrant soul who is creative and really fun.” Imogen loves Aine’s resilience. “She’s super-focused at work and she’s able to handle everything life throws at her. She’s so joyful – and she brings out the joy in me.” Want to share your story?

3/28/2022,"Twenty-five years after The Full Monty became a worldwide box office hit, the team behind the film has begun work on a TV sequel for Disney+. The movie – which followed a group of unemployed former steelworkers in Sheffield attempting to make a living from a Chippendales-style striptease act – is being turned into an eight-part drama series. It will reunite the original cast, including Robert Carlyle, and is being created by the movie’s Oscar-winning screenwriter, Simon Beaufoy, and its producer, Uberto Pasolini. It will be directed by Andrew Chaplin (whose credits include BBC Two’s Alma’s Not Normal) and Catherine Morshead (No Offence, Ashes to Ashes). The plot will catch up with the characters as they navigate healthcare, education and employment today. Disney+ said the series “will explore the brighter, sillier and more humane way forward where communal effort can still triumph over adversity”. Beaufoy said: “We’re chuffed to bits to get all the Monty men back together again – now with a chaotic entourage of children, grandchildren, pets and assorted hangers-on – to see what life in Sheffield is like 25 years on.” Lee Mason, the director of scripted content at Disney, added: “Twenty-five years ago, Simon introduced us to a group of funny, fearless and resilient unemployed working-class men from Sheffield and the world fell in love with them. “We’re delighted to reunite the original cast … and we can’t wait to introduce a host of exciting new faces and characters.” The original movie took £154m ($258m) at the box office and was the 10th biggest film that year. It was nominated for four Oscars, winning for best original musical or comedy score, and won the Bafta for best film. It became such a sensation that Prince Charles did an imitation of a scene where the characters perform a dance routine while queueing for benefits. The success was particularly impressive given that the film was produced on a budget of only £2m. “We were all staying in a budget hotel in Brook Hill, Sheffield, hitting the bar after shooting, getting about four hours sleep a night. All six of us had one trailer to change in,” said Hugo Speer in 2019. “We’d be hopping up and down on one leg trying to put a pair of socks on, crashing into each other. The makeup team did all our intimate waxing and shaving. The camaraderie on screen was genuine.” Beaufort has previously revisited the Full Monty, having turned it into a play which ran at the Noël Coward theatre before touring. Other adaptations include a Broadway musical that also ran in the West End, a novelisation by Wendy Holden and a franchise of ITV celebrity specials, which featured stars including Ashley Banjo and Alexander Armstrong recreating routines to raise money for charity. The drama begins shooting in Sheffield and Manchester today.",Arts/Television & radio,Hot stuff: The Full Monty to return as TV series after 25 years,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/the-full-monty-to-return-as-tv-series-after-25-years
3/28/2022,"In their introduction to the new book Queer Spaces, An Atlas of LGBTIQ+ Places, author Olivia Laing describes queer space: “It’s not just a physical building to hook up or hang out. Instead it’s an alternate universe, a secret network that runs right around the world.” The idea of a world where you’re allowed to write the rules and experiment is one that many creatives relate to. In his art book The Council House, photographer Jack Young celebrates the estates that sprung up in London in the idealist post-war era. His contemporary photographs showcase the remarkable architecture of these homes, reminding you of the good intentions behind social planning. Finally, if you want to find an alternate way to see the universe, sign the petition to get the vulva spaceship into development. A German feminist group is determined to replace the aerodynamically inferior phallic rocket with this new design. Because even in space, equality matters. Definitely a space where no man has gone before. For more news on architecture, sustainable living, art, fashion and new ideas, sign up for our monthly newsletter here Artist Steven Campbell always loved clothes. During his studies at Glasgow School of Art in the late 70s, he’d buy a suit each week from Oxfam, wear it to paint, to the pub, to lectures, then throw it away and buy a new one the following Monday. He was fascinated by performance artists such as Gilbert & George and Bruce McLean. Even when painting became his passion – winning him a Fulbright scholarship to New York’s Pratt Institute in 1982 – his vivid works teemed with clothes and sartorial persona. Over the years, his inspirations included film noir, Bram Stoker’s Dracula, PG Wodehouse, Pinocchio and film director David Lynch. His own appearance remained eye-catching, as his Glasgow art tutor Sandy Moffat once wrote of Campbell, he was “a flamboyant figure, often outlandishly attired, [who] looked as if he had arrived from the Paris or Vienna of the late 19th century”. Campbell was a celebrated painter in 80s New York, where he lived with his wife, Carol – who worked for sculptor Isamu Noguchi – then part of the Scottish art renaissance (known as the New Glasgow Boys, which he hated) when he returned to his homeland. He died far too young, aged 54 of a ruptured appendix in 2007. New exhibition Dressing Above Your Station looks at the importance of fashion and textiles in Campbell’s work, including his own wardrobe replete with his Comme des Garçons collection, accepted as payment for one of his paintings during his New York days. This virtual exhibition is curated by fashion designer and co-founder of label Atelier EB Beca Lipscombe and art historian Mairi MacKenzie, two Scottish creatives who relate to Campbell’s desire to make a statement. “The exhibition looks at the role of clothing in Steven and his wife Carol’s life and aspirations,” says Lipscombe. “The importance of leaving and returning home to their sartorial biographies, and what it feels to stick out like a sore thumb in Scotland.” It’s also a good chance to remember the work of a great painter. Dressing Above Your Station, is a virtual exhibition which can also be seen as projections in the windows of Tramway Museum and shop windows in Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, 31 March-26 June Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Richard Branson blasting into space may have been a giant step for white, middle-aged billionaires, but did little to make anyone feel good about equality. As only 12% of space travellers have been female and woman has yet to walk on the moon, last year’s space explorers felt depressingly par for the course. But a German feminist group has a plan to change this. Wer braucht Feminismus? (translation: “who needs feminism?”) was started as an art-based feminism project in 2012 by artist Jasmin Mittag, but has developed into a networking and grass-roots campaigning organisation in Germany. This year, WBF has teamed up with aeronautics expert Dr Lucia Hartmann to form WBF Aeronautics – a space start-up. Hartmann’s main area of research is spacecraft efficiency and she’s created a vulva-shaped craft which is more aerodynamic than the typical phallic rocket. Hartmann says that the ship’s V-shape makes it surprisingly aerodynamic and also contributes to better fuel efficiency. “There’s less drag than on a conventional spacecraft.” She’s clear about her feminist message, too. In the promotional video for the vulva project, she wonders: “If space is for everyone, is a phallic-shaped rocket really the best way of getting there?” WBF Aeronautics has launched a petition on change.org to get the European Space Agency to consider the vulva spaceship for development. “With our mission, we prove that gender equality even has a place in space. We are not only inspiring space travel, but also rewriting the gender narrative,” says Mittag. “In space travel, all the problems that we have on earth are amplified. It’s time for equal opportunities in the entire universe.” This month, Harewood House in Leeds opens its doors to artists seeking to answer the question Why Craft Matters. This is the theme of the second Harewood Biennial and, until August, the public can view these creatives’ attempts to address climate change or equality through craft. The Harewood Trust is trying to answer its own question about what makes a stately home relevant in the 21st century and the interesting range of artists involved in the biennial reflects how they’re trying to widen the house’s appeal. Designer Mac Collins has designed a domino set, games table and stools, inspired by the Caribbean community’s domino-playing culture for Harewood’s Cinnamon Drawing Room. Collins describes their presence in a room full of Chippendale furniture and lined with portraits of the Lascelles family, as a combined act of material and socio-cultural representation. Textiles artist Celia Pym has set up a “mending desk” and asked Harewood’s staff to bring a garment for her to repair, in exchange for a story of how these individuals care, repair and look after the estate. Architectural reclamation company Retrouvius. replaces the eight leaves of the table in the State Dining Room with reclaimed materials that mirror the original Robert Adam ceiling (which was taken to the Sir John Soane’s Museum). Smile Plastics, a Welsh company that recycles household plastic waste into building materials, as worked on a project to create a series of self-assembly, modular seating, which snakes its way around the north lawn of Harewood. Hugo Macdonald, curator, says: “Radical Acts [Why Craft Matters] brings together an exciting group of creative activists, joined by their commitment to craft as a force for positive impact. The biennial is not so much an exhibition as a call to arms. These are stories and initiatives to inspire us all so that, as individuals, we can make conscious choices that have positive impacts. It is a radical act to take responsibility for our lifestyles and our livelihoods, and to discover that our future is in our hands.” Harewood Biennial 2022 is at Harewood House, Leeds until 29 August Jack Young fell in love with London’s council housing during his lunch break. He’d explore Chamberlin, Powell and Bon’s Golden Lane Estate and the Barbican, architectural delights situated near the office where he worked as a product designer. Before long he found himself setting out at weekends to photograph developments and blocks around the capital. An instagram account was born. He’s devoted to the post-war era, when rebuilding society felt possible and civic planners had big dreams and architects, such as Kate Macintosh and Erno Goldfinger, had a vision of providing quality houses for all. It’s the estates from this era that fill the pages of his new book, The Council House. Though many of these buildings are now in disrepair, their inhabitants and architects more jaded about utopian ideals, Young’s images capture the best of these estates. In his introduction, he recalls how he was sometimes invited in by residents who watched bemused as he took his photos or that they would laugh at him as he obsessed over a concrete staircase. “But their pride in these estates was joyfully clear,” he writes. “It is my hope that in showcasing and championing the beauty and intelligence in these buildings, I can help to restore some of the rightful pride that was once felt in them.” The Council House by Jack Young (Hoxton Mini Press, £18.95) is out now Sign up to the Design Review Monthly newsletter Simon Linke has a new exhibition opening in London gallery Darren Flook this week. If you’re a fan of the conceptual artist, you know that his new show will be very like his others. Since the 1980s, when Linke first found fame as an artist and as an inspiration to the YBAs, he has only painted adverts from American art magazine Artforum. Few artists have been so faithful to an inspiration: for 35 years now, his canvases, thick with oil paint, have been ads for gallery and museum shows taken from Artforum. Though in the new show – his first for 10 years – he’s added unexpected texture to the graphic designs. On YouTube you can still find an excellent segment on Linke from revered 90s British culture TV programme The Late Show. In his interview with critic Matthew Collings Linke first gives monosyllabic answers, then interviews Collings, before finally admitting that in his work “I’ve found something that helps me negotiate the anxiety about what we can do and how we stay relevant”. And, although, looking at his work, there are good points to be made about art, repetition, commerce, history, and the influence of Freud and Warhol, this hard-won quote is still relevant all these years later. As gallerist Darren Flook, says: “Art and commerce are now so profoundly linked, auction prices are in newspapers and pop stars show off the art they’ve bought on their instagram feeds. It’s incredible to me that in the 80s a British painter really beautifully and quietly pointed it all out. It was so conceptually tight and visually pleasurable – and now – 35 years later, he’s still making them. Like art and money or power, the dance is the same.” Simon Linke is at Darren Flook, London, until 15 May “The idea that queerness requires an ecosystem to flourish helps clarify the fundamental importance of queer space,” writes Olivia Laing in the foreword to the new book Queer Spaces, An Atlas of LGBTIQ+ Places and Stories. “It’s not just a physical building to hook up or hang out. Instead it’s an alternate universe, a secret network that runs right around the world.” It’s a great introduction to this new book by designer Adam Nathaniel Furman and architectural historian Joshua Mardell which shares the stories and philosophy of the different, ingenious places which have served as havens for LGBTIQ+ people throughout time. Though some of these essays celebrate well established institutions which identify as queer (such as bookshops and community centres), there’s also a looking-glass world here, full of Havanan ice-cream shops, Sheffield terrace houses and Spanish train journeys, inventive and secret places created by the queer community. Designer Adam Nathaniel Furman says he hopes the book will become the resource he felt he missed as a student. “During a lonely and homophobic architectural education, there were no resources where I could find accessible histories and case-studies that showed how I was not alone, how what I was doing had a deep and rich history, full of proud individuals and incredible groups, spaces and communities creating radical spaces and ways of living.” With Queer Spaces, he’s achieved that.

3/28/2022,"HSBC has reportedly removed references to a “war” in Ukraine from research reports, amid calls for the British bank to close its operations in Russia. Russia’s government refers only to a “special military operation” in Ukraine, and Vladimir Putin’s regime has criminalised reporting on its invasion that contains any information from non-official sources, with prison sentences of up to 15 years. The bank’s committees that review all research sent to clients have amended multiple reports to soften the language used on the subject, including changing the word “war” to “conflict”, according to the Financial Times, which cited two people with direct knowledge of the matter. HSBC is under pressure to follow the lead of some of its largest international rivals and close its Russian operations, which employ about 200 people serving multinational clients based outside the country. Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank have announced plans to wind down their Russian businesses. Several of the largest Russian banks have been placed under sanctions by the US, EU and UK, making it difficult for foreign banks to carry out transactions in Russia. HSBC has declined some new Russian clients and refused to extend credit to existing customers, according to Reuters, after saying on 14 March that it was “not accepting any new business in Russia”. However, it has not announced plans to withdraw or wind down its operations. MPs from the Conservative party, Labour and the Liberal Democrats have said HSBC should leave Russia. The Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge earlier this month said banks should “do the right thing” and sever ties with Russia. Kevin Hollinrake, a Conservative MP, said HSBC’s continued presence in Russia “cannot be justified” and added there were “clear commercial and moral reasons” to shut down the operation. Hollinrake said on Monday he would be closing his HSBC account. “Have they seen the horrific, appalling footage the rest of us are watching on our TV screens every night? Ukrainians are sacrificing everything to keep what we and the directors of HSBC take for granted: freedom,” Hollinrake said. “We all have a responsibility to support them whatever the personal or business cost. I will be closing my HSBC account today and hope many others do the same.” The move to edit analyst reports had prompted strong complaints from some staff, the Financial Times reported. A person briefed on the situation said the research team had issued some reports making explicit reference to the war but acknowledged that there were often sensitivities around research reports. The content of analyst reports, which are provided as a service to clients, is not usually controlled at a group level. HSBC declined to comment. It has previously said: “Our thoughts are with all those impacted by the continuing conflict in Ukraine.” The statement also said the bank “will continue to operate in line with local regulatory requirements”.",News/Business,HSBC cuts references to Ukraine ‘war’ from its analyst reports,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/28/hsbc-ukraine-war-reports-bank-russia
