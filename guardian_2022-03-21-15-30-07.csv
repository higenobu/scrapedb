3/21/2022,"We live, thanks to the coronavirus, in the age of the Zoom interview. But not this time. Ken Croke does not want to be on camera so the words “Ken’s iPhone XR” appear on a black background instead. Nor does he disclose where he lives or where he is speaking from today. Croke has good reason to be discreet. The 56-year-old is online to talk about his new book, Riding with Evil, which chronicles how he became the first federal agent to go undercover and infiltrate the Pagan Motorcycle Club, a white supremacist gang. The memoir describes how Croke created a fake identity, won the bikers’ confidence, secretly recorded their meetings, witnessed their violent crimes and even spent several days in jail on a gun arrest. Over two years his cover was never blown, though some members were suspicious of his true motivations. The daring operation paid off with more than 20 Pagans arrested on charges including racketeering, murder conspiracy, extortion, drug trafficking, assault and weapons violations, leading to combined prison sentences of more than a hundred years. But some have since been released and the gang is far from finished. “They put two contracts out on me shortly after the case and they were investigated,” says Croke, a retired assistant director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). “I’m under the umbrella of ATF: they are constantly monitoring and checking and enquiring and following through on any threats or information related to threats. “Some years ago people who did these types of investigations would go into hiding – literally they would move away – but in this day and age you can’t hide. Would they want to do harm to me? They could. I’m very self aware of my environment. I always keep an eye out, but I’m not living my life looking over my shoulder.” Croke began his career in 1990 in Los Angeles, where he infiltrated street gangs and busted drug and gun rings. Over 25 years, he took part in more than a thousand undercover operations including gang, drug and firearms trafficking cases. Married with three young daughters, he was a supervisor who seemed to be cruising to a quiet suburban retirement. But when a tip about criminal motorcycle gangs came in to the Boston ATF field office in 2008, the experienced Croke was brought in to check out sources and information. Then came a chance encounter with an associate of the Pagans. “One thing led to another,” as he puts it, and he was on the case. The Pagans are one of America’s most notorious motorcycle gangs along with the Hells Angels, Mongols and Outlaws. Dave Wedge, a journalist who co-authored the book, adds in the same Zoom call: “A lot of these other biker clubs have mainstream members who may have jobs and they’re good members of society. “That doesn’t really seem to be the case with the Pagans. They’re mostly all outlaws and pretty much everyone that I researched for this book all had felony records. They are definitely a very violent organised crime syndicate.” Croke gradually earned the trust of the Pagans and became a fully patched member of their chapter in Long Island, New York. He earned the nickname “Slam” after he forcefully subdued a man during a brawl bar. Rarely seeing his family, he had to adapt to a volatile, unpredictable lifestyle where he might be ordered to commit violence or even kill at any moment. He writes: “Every day living with those guys was a mindfuck, especially when I was a prospect [a prospective member]. Every day I woke up, I wondered what sort of shit was going to happen. Would I have to jump into a barroom brawl? Would I be faced with a pile of coke and a choice? What sort of dumb shit would they ask me to do? I always had to expect the unexpected and could never let my guard down. It was a stressful way to live and my brain was working overtime.” Croke adds via Zoom: “There’s no planning this out, there’s no script, there is no ‘Oh, today I’m going to do this.’ I can honestly tell you that never did a day go according to plan. The days that nothing happened were just as unsettling because you never knew. You just go there one day and it’s like, ‘OK, this is what’s going to happen, this is what we’re going to do,’ and the next thing you know, you’re off on this completely different tangent doing something totally different.” On one occasion Croke received a call from a gang member who was unexpectedly and ominously close by and wanted to meet. He scrambled to dress appropriately, drive to a restaurant and play it cool. When Croke went to the toilets, the man followed him to reveal that he had brought a bomb. Croke managed to turn it in to law enforcement while convincing the gang that it had been used to blow up a boat. Another night, at a Pagan dive bar, Croke saw members of the gang attack a man who had shown “disrespect”. He writes: “As Hogman pounded him, I pretended to join in. I threw glancing blows off the side of his head and shoulder, but really I was punching the cement. My hand got bloodied up pretty good.” When Hogman lifted his huge leg to stomp on the man’s head, which could have broken his neck, Croke swung his own leg in the way. Croke points out: “There’s certain things that I can’t do. There’s certain things that I can’t be a part of. There’s certain things that I will have to stop. There was a night we went to kill somebody; we were going to stab this person and throw them off a roof. That can’t happen and so how am I going to get out of that? “There’s a time when we drove to a house to kill or seriously injure this man. It’s like, ‘OK, I cannot participate in this and I can’t allow it to happen. So what am I going to do to stop it?’ There’s a skill that goes to it, a coordination, but there’s also dumb luck. When we got to that house, if this person was there, we were going to have to come out of role and stop it, which would have ended the investigation.” Croke soon realised that white supremacy was a big part of Pagan culture. “They weren’t burning crosses, but the racism many spewed was persistent, blatant, and strong,” he writes. At first it was uncomfortable to be around, though over time he learned to detach and ignore it. But are there moral dilemmas around how far to go to preserve the cover story? He says now: “The loyalty within the organisation is a big part of it. You have to be a peer, you have to appear to be loyal because the brotherhood within this organisation is more important than your family or anything else. It’s the highest part of how they view things and so you have to play that part and you can’t violate that. “You have to go along with these things knowing that at any moment it could be too far and there are limits. There’s legally things that I could not do and I would have to stop it. There’s also morally things: they’re a white supremacist group and I was not going to participate in a lot of their white supremacy activities.” But spending so much time with the Pagans, did he glimpse humanity beneath the hatred and come to understand why they had fallen into the moral abyss? Did he even come to like some of them in spite of himself? “Some were entertaining to be around; they weren’t evil all the time. They view everyone who’s not one of them as a subculture and so everywhere they go, that’s their thought: you’re not one of us, you’re less than. They call them ‘civilians’ and that kind of thing. “But there were some others that I despised much more, the ones who were most violent, the ones that were just sick in what they did and the lack of regard for people. I know friends of mine who have done this and some have been conflicted for different reasons but I was not one of them.” Once the case wrapped, Croke was required by ATF to see a psychiatrist to make sure had not gone to the “dark side” or become sympathetic to the Pagans’ causes or actions. But the operation had also taken a toll on his family life. He returned home to a big hug from his wife, Ang (also an ATF agent), and daughters. But then he saw how their lives had moved on and Ang was now “like a single mother”. They decided to start their relationship over and begin “dating” again. Croke is now a security consultant for a global corporation. Wedge, 51, whose previous books include Hunting Whitey and The Last Days of John Lennon, reflects from Boston: “The work Ken did reverberates today. There’s a lot of cases that continue to come out in New York, Massachusetts and other jurisdictions where some of the people that were involved in the case Ken did may have had links. “The value of what Ken did defies explanation but the true value is the knowledge going forward for all these other law enforcement agents that are going to be investigating these types of cases. They have a resident expert now that knows this gang better than anyone.” Riding with Evil is out now",Arts/Books,‘They put two contracts out on me’: going undercover with the Pagan Motorcycle Club,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/21/riding-with-evil-ken-croke-pagan-motorcycle-club
3/21/2022,"Part of a ceremonial approach to the great circle of Stonehenge and a spot nearby where ancient hunter-gatherers shared feasts with the first British farmers have been saved from the threat of modern agriculture. The areas are to be restored as chalk grassland, which will benefit flora and fauna, including wild flowers, butterflies and hares, with the aim that they will eventually be opened to the public. One of the areas includes a stretch of the Avenue, a route that runs 1.5 miles from the banks of the River Avon to the main Stonehenge circle. If and when the new section is opened after restoration work, it will give modern visitors a better feel of what the approach to the circle must have been like for pilgrims thousands of years ago. The second acquisition is land that includes a Neolithic feasting pit at Coneybury, almost a mile south-east of the circle and close to another henge, built about 2,700BC, a little before Stonehenge. Bones of cattle raised by the early farmers and deer caught by hunter-gatherers were found in the pit, suggesting it was a place where the two groups gathered and shared food. The acquisition of the two sites by the National Trust, a total of about 170 hectares (420 acres), means that six monuments, including the stretch of the Avenue, the Coneybury pit and henge, have been removed from Historic England’s at-risk register. The conservation charity already looks after the final stretch of the Avenue just before it reaches the circle, but the acquisition means it will care for the whole of the route north of the A303. Nick Snashall, the trust’s archaeologist for the Stonehenge and Avebury world heritage site, said the areas would be returned to chalk grassland and, in the future, there could be further digs there and, hopefully, public access. She said both sites had in recent years been used for arable farming, with wheat the main crop, and had been damaged by ploughing. “Arable farming can be hugely damaging to archaeology, year after year erasing more and more of the story of the people who built and used the monuments in this landscape,” she said. “It’s fantastic news that we’ve been able to take the single most important step in protecting these sites in decades, by bringing this additional land into our care. By returning them to species-rich chalk grassland we’re both making a home for nature, and ensuring the stories this landscape holds will be here for everyone to discover and enjoy long into the future.” More than 80% of the UK’s chalk grassland has been lost since the second world war, with about half of the remaining grassland in Wiltshire. The National Trust cares for more than 800 hectares of the landscape surrounding the Stonehenge monument and, over the past 20 years, has carried out one of the largest grassland reversion programmes in Europe. It is now home to brown hares, skylarks and Adonis blue butterflies, as well as wildflowers such as sainfoin, cowslip and prickly poppy. Rebecca Burton, the regional director at the National Trust, said: “We have been working for years to revert more of the Stonehenge world heritage site to chalk grassland which, as well as protecting the archaeology, will allow nature to thrive. It will mean people will be able to experience a landscape that would have been more familiar to the builders of Stonehenge.” Duncan Wilson, the chief executive of Historic England, said: “Some of these sites close to Stonehenge were vulnerable to continued arable cultivation, including part of the Avenue. We are delighted that the National Trust has been able to secure the conservation ownership and control of this land, leading to the removal of six key monuments from our heritage at-risk register and the protection of other important archaeological remains. “This will also help facilitate wider access to the landscape, a further step towards one day in the future the exciting prospect for people to once again walk the ceremonial route along the Avenue.”",News/UK news,Part of the way to Stonehenge to be restored to how ancient pilgrims saw it,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/21/part-of-the-way-to-stonehenge-to-be-restored-to-how-ancient-pilgrims-saw-it
3/21/2022,"With one sizable difference, they could be scenes of everyday recreation in the sunshine state of Florida: a tourist playing with a football, another eagerly chasing a remote control boat round a lake. But the remarkable images posted to social media over the past week feature alligators, not humans – seeming to confirm a Tennessee university study that said crocodilians like to have fun too. A picture posted to the Alligators of Florida Facebook page by Sandra Raymon Harrison showed an alligator in south the Big Cypress preserve with a football in its jaws. How the reptile came across the ball, and whether it had any playmates, was not specified. Commentators worried that the alligator had the ball stuck in its mouth were assured by experts who pointed out the massive force of the creature’s bite could pop the ball in a heartbeat. The second playful gator was captured in a short video clip posted to the website of Jacksonville’s ActionNewsJax TV, swimming in hot pursuit of a remote-controlled boat. The images were shot by a producer from the station who filmed a neighbor launching the vessel and noticed the alligator swimming along in pursuit. The animated alligator changes speed and direction several times as the boat zips before it. Both episodes appear to bear out the research of University of Tennessee Knoxville animal behavior expert Vladimir Dinets, whose 2015 study, Play Behaviour in Crocodilians, noted such behavior was not uncommon. “Social play by crocodilians is almost never reported but this doesn’t mean that it is particularly rare,” Dinets wrote, after spending more than 3,000 hours observing crocodilians in the wild and captivity. He witnessed alligators at play with river otters in Big Cypress and detailed the story of a crocodile in Costa Rica that bonded with its rescuer. “Play behavior included swimming together, rushing at [him] with an open mouth in mock charges, sneaking on him from behind as if to startle him, and accepting being caressed, hugged, rotated in the water and kissed on the snout,” he wrote. According to a Science Daily report accompanying the study, the results “show[ed] a softer side of the intimidating creatures – one that includes romping around with river otters and people”. A third recent episode of Florida alligators potentially at play, however, had to be discounted. A video posted to Facebook of an apparently friendly 20ft alligator named Grandpappy leading a 6ft reptile across a Lakeland golf course ended with the smaller of the two being eaten.",News/US news,Alligators just want to have fun: Florida images may show predators at play,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/21/alligators-florida-predators-play
3/21/2022,"Our police services across the UK are under intense scrutiny. The onus is on us to nurture trust and legitimacy by demonstrating no tolerance for misogyny, racism and discrimination within policing and across society. Equally, ensuring an effective and professional policing response for victims and communities is a prerequisite for public confidence. Two recent reports from Sir Michael Barber and Sir Tom Winsor both called for structural, cultural and operational reform of policing in England and Wales, as referred to in last week’s Guardian editorial. But when discussing policing reform in Britain, it is important to consider the experiences of Police Scotland. Nine years ago, 10 policing organisations in Scotland merged into a single national police service of about 23,000 people, the second largest in the UK, serving a third of Britain’s land mass and communities in villages, towns, islands and cities. Establishing a reformed service has been enormously challenging and we did not get everything right. However, much progress has been made. Under our structure, we have strengthened operational competence and provided direct access to all policing capabilities for every citizen. More than 520 murders and homicides have been committed in Scotland since 2013. Only two are currently unsolved. Our safety and security operation for last November’s Cop26 resulted in no significant violence, disorder or injury and relatively few arrests. The climate change summit, along with our approach to policing during the pandemic, demonstrated our core duty and responsibility to enable the public to make their voices heard – and independent reviewing has largely concluded Police Scotland did so in line with our commitment to put human rights at the heart of all we do. Last month, I announced Police Scotland will become the first service in the world to train and equip all operational officers with Naloxone, a life-saving overdose first aid nasal-spray, on a national basis, reflecting our broad mission to improve the safety and wellbeing of communities as enshrined in the law establishing Police Scotland. Tests remain: operational failings, or when we don’t live up to our values, are rightly subject to critical review and require persistent leadership, focus and action. We must face up to the cultural challenges of UK policing as a whole, of other sectors and organisations, and of wider society. That’s been underlined by reports including Dame Elish Angiolini’s review of police complaints and individual cases such as Rhona Malone’s employment tribunal, describing unacceptable behaviours. There is a moral imperative and operational necessity for policing to lead change to improve the experiences of all our communities, including our own officers and staff. Words and good intent are not enough. There must be action; practical, firm, progressive, visible action. Structural simplicity and stability can help drive progress: our response to serious offending has been transformed under reform but we continue to listen so we can do better, our resolve to tackle violence against women and girls being a clear example. Last year, I was grateful to meet survivors to hear directly about their experiences of the criminal justice system. The voices and perspectives of survivors and groups such as Rape Crisis Scotland are vital and help us to improve our response to rape and sexual offending. Every year since reform we have returned more than £200m to the public purse while providing better, more efficient policing. This remains an achievement and a challenge – especially given that serving increasingly complex community needs requires significant investment. Digitally enabled offending such as online child sexual abuse and fraud continue to grow at a very high rate, underlining that online policing is frontline policing. We must build the workforce and tools to keep people safe in public, private and virtual spaces. It is wrong to view community policing and specialist capability as competing imperatives – they complement each other and both are essential to build public confidence. Confidence to come forward. Confidence you will be treated fairly, with compassion and respect. Confidence our response will be professional and thorough. Reform has enabled clearer communication, leadership and accountability – key when driving change. Last October, our That Guy public awareness campaign asked men to challenge their own and each other’s behaviours and attitudes towards women. This was an important message for Scottish society, including for us in policing – as individuals and as a service. A verification scheme, established to reassure women approached by lone officers, also reflected the onus on policing to accept responsibility for addressing public concerns. Policing in Scotland is realistic about the challenges ahead but confident in the progress made and optimistic we can build on it. I am encouraged by the consistently strong levels of public confidence reported in our own research, and by the recent Scottish government household survey which found 87% of respondents trusted the police. The key assessment I apply is whether our communities and people are safer and better served now than they would have been had reform not taken place - not only for the threats of today but those of tomorrow. The answer is yes. As we continue our own development, our offer is to share the insight and value that Scotland’s hard-earned lessons can provide to improve policing for communities across the UK.

3/21/2022,"Bewley’s Cafe on Grafton Street has been a Dublin institution ever since it opened almost 100 years ago. Such is the public’s affection for the grand three-story period cafe that each threatened closure is met with an outpouring of nostalgic horror. But now the building is facing an existential threat of a different kind over a plan to sell the six large stained glass windows in the main coffee hall in a dispute over rent. Long considered the jewel in the coffee hall’s crown, they were designed in 1927 by Harry Clarke, who is regarded as one of Ireland’s leading symbolist artists and the country’s finest ever stained glass window artist. The six windows illustrate the four orders of architecture showing Doric, Corinthian, Ionic and Composite columns adorned and topped by vases of flowers with two other decorative glassworks added to a second wall in a commission by the original Bewley-family owner. The question as to whether they are windows or decorative panels, which can be removed altogether, is now at the centre of a high court battle – with the commercial tenants arguing that they are movable artworks, not windows. RGRE, owned by Irish developer Johnny Ronan, and the building owners have rejected the argument and are in court seeking a declaration to give legal effect to their argument that the windows are an integral part of the structure that cannot be removed or sold separately. The dispute appears to be one of the strangest to have emerged in the wake of the pandemic, which crushed many in the hospitality sector. But it has its roots in a longer-term issue in Ireland over “upward” rent reviews built into contracts between commercial tenants and landlords. As a tenant, Bewley’s was required to pay €1.4m (£1.18m) a year, the result of a series of upward rent reviews, and last year asked for this to be reduced to €300,000 or 10% of sales if higher. Bewley’s also proposed selling the windows, valued at €1m, to a parent company to cover some of the rent going forward, arguing the windows were not windows, but decorative panels and therefore “movable chattels”. To protect the heritage, Bewley’s proposed that the parent company would then donate the windows to the state, enraging the owner further. RGRE has rejected their arguments. In court papers, Rory Williams, the chief executive of RGRE, said the company would “not dream” of removing the windows and insisted they were part of the structure of the premises. Bewley’s, he said, “cannot try to sell us what we already own”. His company claimed that the “seemingly altruistic gesture” to sell and then donate the windows to the state would essentially leave the taxpayer out of pocket as donations of heritage items attract a tax credit of 80%. RGRE is now seeking a court declaration that the Harry Clarke windows were part of the structure and cannot be removed, sold or donated to the state. Over several days, witnesses were cross examined on hinges, brass hopper mechanisms, sashes and the question of whether Harry Clarke would have overseen the joinery work relating to the structures or not. Expert witnesses were questioned about the weathering of the windows, about the smoke and odours, smells and air from a food area and the genesis of the stained glass artwork. Was it the case that clear glass was originally swapped for the Harry Clarke panels or were there originally two lawyers of windows? At one stage, the barrister quipped that the case reminded him of a Christmas cracker joke: when is a window not a window? When it’s ajar. “In this case, it’s ‘when is a window not a window? When it’s an objet d’art’,” he said. Mr Justice McDonald told the court he had not been in Bewley’s for 40 years but two weeks ago paid visit to help him make his assessment. After closing submissions were made in the case on Wednesday, McDonald has reserved his judgement while he ponders whether Harry Clarke’s stained glass windows are windows or not.",News/World news,When is a window not a window?

3/21/2022,"More than 80% of GPs believe that patients are being put at risk when they come into their surgery for an appointment, a new survey shows. A poll of 1,395 GPs found only 13% said their practice was safe for patients all the time. Meanwhile, 85% expressed concerns about patient safety, with 2% saying patients were “rarely” safe, 22% saying they were safe “some of the time” and 61% saying they were safe “most of the time”. Asked if they thought the risk to patient safety was increasing in their surgery, 70% said it was. Family doctors identified lack of time with patients, workforce shortages, relentless workloads and heavy administrative burdens as the main reasons people receiving care could be exposed to risk. The survey, which was self-selecting, also found that: 91% said more GPs would help improve the state of general practices. 84% have had anxiety, stress or depression over the past year linked to their job. 31% know a colleague who was physically abused by a patient in the last year. 24% know of a member of general practice staff who has taken their own life due to work pressures. “The evidence shows that, after you’ve already made 25 to 35 decisions about patients’ health on a particular day, that as a GP the risk of making a bad decision goes up,” said Dr Kieran Sharrock, a GP in Lincolnshire and the deputy chair of the British Medical Association’s GP committee. “That could be prescribing an ineffective medicine for a patient, or making a referral to hospital for them when it’s not needed or, worse than that, not making a referral when it is needed. For example, we miss a red flag sign of cancer because we are overloaded already with decisions.” Sharrock is one of the leading lights in a new campaign, called “Rebuild General Practice”, which is calling for urgent action to improve GP services. Patients are waiting longer than before to get an appointment as surgeries struggle with a shortage of both GPs and other staff such as receptionists, practice nurses, pharmacists and mental health support workers. Asked why they thought patients’ safety was at risk, 86% of the GPs surveyed in England, Scotland and Wales mentioned not having enough time to fulfil patients’ needs. Others cited the widespread shortage of GPs (77%), having too many patients to look after (66%), and too few staff (63%). Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, who is backing the campaign, said: “The workforce crisis is the biggest issue facing the NHS. We can forget fixing the backlog unless we urgently come up with a plan to train enough doctors for the future and, crucially, retain the ones we’ve got.” In 2015 Hunt pledged to increase the number of GPs in England by 5,000 by 2020. He acknowledged that he missed that target because more retired early than joined. Boris Johnson promised in the 2019 general election to boost the GP workforce by 6,000 by 2024-25. However, Sajid Javid, the health secretary, has admitted that that pledge will not be delivered either. A continuing high rate of early retirement means that the number of full-time GPs is still falling. Over half either agreed (29%) or strongly agreed (24%) that working as a GP is incompatible with a healthy family life, while just 24% would recommend general practice as a career. “We are at a turning point for general practice. Workload has gone inexorably up and workforce has gone downwards, and if that continues, general practice will fail. It will be unsafe for patients and therefore the NHS will also fail because general practice is the bedrock of the NHS,” added Sharrock. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “There has been an increase of more than 1,600 GPs over the past two years. “Through the GP access plan, we have made £520m available to improve access and expand general practice capacity during the pandemic. This is in addition to £1.5bn announced in 2020 to create an additional 50m general practice appointments by 2024 by increasing and diversifying the workforce.”",News/Society,"Over 80% of UK GPs think patients are at risk in their surgery, survey finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/21/80-per-cent-gps-patients-at-risk-surgery-survey

Monday’s hearing will be devoted to opening statements from Jackson and from the committee’s 22 senators, who are evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. Two days of questioning of the candidate will follow, with outside witnesses called on Thursday. A full vote of the Senate is expected to determine Jackson’s fate before a recess on 8 April. The White House will be hoping for a smooth and dignified confirmation process under the capable oversight of Dick Durbin, the Democratic senator from Illinois, who chairs the select committee. But Democratic managers cannot be complacent about the chances of Jackson getting through. Critical to her chances of success will be whether any moderate Republicans can be lured to back her at a time when opposition senators supporting supreme court nominees has become increasingly rare. When Jackson was confirmed by the Senate for a seat in the US court of appeals for the DC circuit in June, three Republicans came on board: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. This time, though, Graham has indicated that he might be less amenable, suggesting Jackson mixes in radical leftwing circles. Should the Democrats fail to attract bipartisan support, then all eyes will turn to the most conservative Democratic senators – in particular Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who has already scuppered much of Biden’s policy ambitions. With a 50-50 split in the Senate, and Vice-President Kamala Harris holding the tie-breaking vote, the Democrats cannot afford even a single defection if the vote goes on party lines. From the moment that Breyer announced his retirement in January, issues of race have been at the front and centre of the search for his successor. In nominating Jackson, Biden honoured the pledge he made during the 2020 presidential election campaign to pick a Black woman for the court. Biden’s vow “to make sure we get everyone represented”, made in the course of a televised debate with Donald Trump, was seen as pivotal in gaining him the support of Black voters. That in turn helped Biden secure his own nomination as Democratic presidential candidate and with it the presidency. Leading Republicans have attempted to use Biden’s selection of a Black woman as a stick with which to beat him. They have decried the decision as an “affirmative-action hire” and a product of “wokeness” – overlooking the fact that Ronald Reagan followed through on his 1980 promise to put a woman on the top court. Born in Washington, Jackson was brought up largely in Florida and legally trained at Harvard law school. She is unusual among candidates for the supreme court to have had experience as a public defender representing criminal defendants. She has sat on the federal bench since 2013, rising to the US appeals court for the DC circuit last year. That court has been labelled the “second highest court in the land” because so many supreme court justices have been plucked from there.",News/US news,Ketanji Brown Jackson hearings begin – could Republicans sink her chances?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/21/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-confirmation-hearings
3/21/2022,"Viewers are living in a golden age of TV, spoilt by more must-watch shows, films and live sport than at any time in broadcasting history, but the cost of getting it all has risen to £2,500 a year, leaving some entertainment fans wondering if they can afford the streaming revolution. The global streaming phenomenon has resulted in the launch of an unprecedented amount of services, mostly paid-for – from Netflix and Amazon to Disney+ and tiers of ITV’s latest effort, ITVX – that compete alongside pay-TV providers such as Sky and BT and the licence fee-funded BBC for a share of household budgets that are being pushed to breaking point. With inflation running at a 30-year high, and already soaring energy prices being pushed higher by the war in Ukraine, the rising cost of everything from food to petrol is forcing households to tighten their belts. The TV and video services that saved the UK from lockdown boredom – Britons spent 40% of their waking hours stuck at home watching TV – are no longer being viewed as the sacrosanct household essentials they were at the height of Covidpandemic, which fuelled a record rise in global subscribers. “The public perception has been that these services are cheap,” says Tom Harrington, head of television at Enders Analysis. “And they certainly were. But the cost is now quickly transitioning from what is for many an automatic and then forgotten regular discretionary spend, to a noticeable chunk leaving their account.” Viewers who can’t bear to miss out on the best TV on offer – from Premier League and Champions League football to dramas such as The Crown and Peaky Blinders, and blockbuster franchises such as Star Wars and Marvel – will have to find about £200 a month on average. Enders Analysis estimates that consumers have the opportunity to access 130,000 hours of content from streamers and video-on-demand offerings, compared with a comparatively measly 30,000 hours as recently as 2016. As the market has boomed, the cost, which includes the average monthly price of a broadband and phone package, has increased by almost a quarter in the last three years, from £2,040 in 2019. Ampere Analysis, which compiled the figures, says that the increase is mostly to do with the proliferation of new services as the streaming wars hit their peak. However, UK households are now also facing inflation-busting increases in their home broadband, phone and pay-TV packages of up to 10%. And the financial war of attrition initiated by Netflix offering a low-cost, binge-watching model to build global scale – then aped by all rivals – has become a hunt for sustainable profitability, with consumers paying the price. Last week, Netflix raised its prices in the UK and Ireland for the second time in two years, making for a 22% increase in the price of its most popular plan, which is now £10.99 a month, over that period. And last year Disney+ upped its cost by a third after adding more content for subscribers. Netflix says that price rises are the cost of funding its swelling content budget, which has risen from $7bn to $18bn annually in the last four years, as it fights to maintain its position as the world’s favourite streaming service. “The streaming market has been supported by debt-funded, loss-leading, loss-making models,” says Harrington. “Netflix entered the market and set a budget price and everyone has had to come in under that to compete. You had all these profitable content companies, pay-TV and linear-TV broadcasters who had to move into streaming, and it is not as profitable. Now they have to start looking at value, and customers are going to be continually asked to pay more until these things make real money.” The drive for revenue, and the squeeze on customers, was highlighted last week when Netflix began its long-expected crackdown on a huge subscriber perk: password sharing. Until now, Netflix has let password sharing run rampant as breakneck growth outweighed the need to crackdown on families and friends being able to watch Netflix for a few pounds. In a blogpost on Wednesday, Chengyi Long, director of product innovation at Netflix, said the practice was “impacting our ability to invest in great new TV and films for our members”. The company announced a trial in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru charging between £1 and £2.50 to allow subscribers to add people from outside their household to their account. The crackdown could add millions to Netflix’s bottom line. The research firm Magid has estimated that about a third of Netflix users share their password with someone else. Netflix’s decision also means, however, that many of those “borrowing” passwords will now have to decide if they want to add another cost to their monthly outgoings. “The pandemic was good if you were a subscription service,” says Richard Broughton, an analyst at Ampere. “People were stuck at home and even those with their finances under pressure found home entertainment a must-have. But now there is a cost-of-living crunch on the horizon. With so many pay-TV and streaming products, I think we will see consumers seriously assessing their monthly outgoings. It will be about winning that battle to be seen as essential entertainment.”",Arts/Television & radio,"Golden age of streaming could cost viewers up to £2,500 a year",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/21/golden-age-of-streaming-could-cost-viewers-up-to-2500-a-year
3/21/2022,"It is a “moral imperative and operational necessity” for police forces across the UK to demonstrate “no tolerance for misogyny, racism and discrimination” within their ranks and across wider society, the head of Police Scotland has said, adding that the voices of survivors of sexual violence are “vital” in making improvements. Writing exclusively for the Guardian, the chief constable of the force, Iain Livingstone, says: “Words and good intent are not enough. There must be action – practical, firm, progressive, visible action.” He adds that the “hard-earned lessons” from reforming Police Scotland – the second largest force in the UK – can provide insights for colleagues and communities elsewhere. Almost a decade after Scotland merged 10 policing organisations into a single national service, Livingstone acknowledges that the transition has been “enormously challenging” and “we did not get everything right”, but points to the force’s record on solving murder cases, the policing of the Cop26 climate summit and drug overdose prevention as evidence of how the restructuring has improved policing. Last week, two separate reviews led by Sir Michael Barber and Sir Tom Winsor argued that the 43 forces of England and Wales must operate as a unified network if they are to become fitter for purpose. They also recommended changes to training and skills. Policing culture remains under close scrutiny following the murder of Sarah Everard in March last year and evidence of institutional misogyny and racism at the Met that ultimately led to the resignation last month of the force’s commissioner, Cressida Dick. Livingstone refers to the “Don’t Be That Guy” public awareness campaign, launched last October, which called on men to interrogate their own and their peers’ behaviour towards women. “This was an important message for Scottish society, including for us in policing – as individuals and as a service.” Immediately after details emerged of Everard’s abduction by a serving police officer, Livingstone introduced a verification scheme to reassure women approached by a lone police officer – a measure, he writes, that reflected “the onus on policing to accept responsibility for addressing public concerns”. These moves were welcomed by campaigners, especially in the wake of other responses that appeared to emphasise the need for female victims to take responsibility for protecting themselves. “Operational failings, or when we don’t live up to our values, are rightly subject to critical review,” writes Livingstone. He ordered an independent review last October after an industrial tribunal found evidence of a “sexist culture” in Scotland’s armed police. Another independent public inquiry is currently under way into the death of Sheku Bayoh, who died in 2015 in police custody after he was restrained by officers in Kirkcaldy, Fife. “As we continue our own development,” he concludes, “our offer is to share the insight and value that Scotland’s hard-earned lessons can provide to improve policing for communities across the UK.”",News/UK news,"UK police must do more on misogyny and racism, says head of Scottish force",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/21/uk-police-must-do-more-on-misogyny-and-racism-says-head-of-scottish-force
3/21/2022,"A married couple have been left “broken” and in “shock” after being barred by the Home Office from being together for the birth of their first baby, due in the next few days. Farzana Miah, 23, who lives in Southall, is an Italian citizen who has been granted leave under the EU settlement scheme (EUSS) by the Home Office. She met Mohammed Mushraf, 27, after he came to the UK to study. The couple got married in west London in May 2021 and their child is due on 28 March. Mushraf applied for leave to remain as the partner of someone with EUSS. At the time of the application, the couple were in a relationship, but had had to repeatedly postpone their wedding plans due to the coronavirus pandemic. Officials confirmed that they also had to wait for the Home Office to confirm that their relationship was genuine before the marriage could go ahead. Mushraf received a certificate of application, which entitled him to work, study and rent a property while his application was being considered, on 3 July. It also stated that those in possession of this certificate could “travel in and out of the country without having to prove your status as your information will be checked automatically”. On that basis, the couple decided to travel to India last November to visit Mushraf’s family before the baby was born. But when Mushraf tried to board a plane back to the UK with his wife, he was told by immigration officials that he was being barred entry because he did not have the relevant documentation, such as a residence card. Officials said the certificate of application was not sufficient. Miah had to return to the UK alone. On 10 February, the Home Office refused his application, saying he had failed to provide sufficient evidence that he was a “durable partner” of his wife at the time of the application. Usually this evidence consists of both of the couple’s names on utility bills or rental agreements. However, because the couple are practising Muslims, they had not cohabited in advance of their marriage. Their lawyer, Naga Kandiah of MTC Solicitors, has lodged an urgent appeal that he hopes can be heard before the baby is born. “We are in a state of shock,” said Miah. “Had it not been for what was stated on the Home Office certificate of application about having the right to travel, we never would have travelled to India. I have begged the Home Office to let my husband be with me for the birth of my baby, but I don’t think we can melt their heart. Speaking from India, Mushraf said: “I feel broken. We have tried our best to be together, but I don’t know what else we can do. I want to be in the delivery room with my wife to support her but I’m helpless because of the Home Office.” Kandiah said: “This is a prime example of someone who was misled by the wording of their certificate. It has resulted in the separation of this family at, arguably, one of the most critical times in their lives, the birth of their first child.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “In line with the withdrawal agreement, someone applying to stay in the UK as a durable partner of an EU citizen will generally need to prove, with evidence, the relationship was durable by 31 December 2020 and is ongoing. Where an application is denied, the applicant has 14 days from date of decision to submit an appeal, or 28 if outside the UK.”",News/Politics,Home Office stops married couple being together for birth of first child,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/21/home-office-stops-married-couple-being-together-for-birth-of-first-child
3/21/2022,"Punchdrunk, the company that has for 20 years enthralled theatregoers by exploding traditional dramatic form and setting performers and audiences loose into the same vast, detailed, labyrinthine spaces, is taking on what might be the biggest, most fundamental story of them all – and one, alas, with terrible resonance in this particular moment. It is the siege of Troy: the subject of Homer’s Iliad, the focus of many Greek tragedies and, in many ways, the literary war that has, over millennia, served as a proxy for thinking about other, more recent conflicts. The Burnt City will be the company’s first show on a large scale in the UK since 2013, when it turned an old sorting office near Paddington station in London into a flyblown old Hollywood for The Drowned Man, a version of Büchner’s Woyzeck. The company has, after two decades of finding different spaces in which to make work, acquired a permanent building of its own in Woolwich. “After being nomadic for all this time, we just missed London,” says Felix Barrett, Punchdrunk’s artistic director. The cavernous space, once part of the Royal Arsenal, is at 100,000 sq ft big enough for even this company’s wild ambition. Not that Punchdrunk hasn’t been busy. Its trademark shows – in which the audience, wearing masks, are at liberty to follow their own instincts through the performance space, picking up fragments of wordless narrative as they go – have become sensations elsewhere. At the moment the company has two productions of Sleep No More, a version of Macbeth, running concurrently in New York and Shanghai. Barrett has dipped into TV with The Third Day, an experimental drama starring Jude Law and Naomie Harris, and there have been partnerships with big brands. The commercially produced Sleep No More in New York has been both hugely popular (it has been running for a decade, give or take the pandemic) and, to some, a disappointment, with its add-on champagne tickets, bars and pricey restaurants. In the wake of #MeToo, there were also disturbing allegations by performers and ex-performers of episodes of sexual harassment by audience members. I’m assured that the company has instituted a raft of improved safety measures, including the audience being instructed to stay at a respectful distance from artists, an intimacy director to help them manage one-on-one performance moments, and alert buttons in some of the rooms. The last Punchdrunk show I saw was It Felt Like a Kiss in Manchester in 2009, as part of the city’s international festival, and it ended with me being terrified into a panicked sprint by a barely glimpsed performer apparently wielding a chainsaw. Afterwards, I found it hard to shake the feeling that the audience had been treated rather cheaply, even though I’d been excited by their early work, such as Faust in 2006 and The Masque of the Red Death a year later. Curiosity about Punchdrunk’s immersive approach to Greek tragedy is enough to tempt me back. Certainly, the immense space is shaping up to be thrilling, as becomes clear when its designers – longtime Punchdrunk collaborators Livi Vaughan and Bea Minns – show me around the set-in-progress. The huge warehouse is divided into two zones: Greece and Troy. To enter this world, the audience passes through a kind of liminal zone: a make-believe museum that, when the creators describe it to me, reminds me a bit of the 2019 Troy exhibition at the British Museum. It will contain objects resembling, for instance, Attic black-figure vases. “If people look carefully, they will see scenes represented on them that happen in the show later on,” says Vaughan – such as the killing of Agamemnon’s daughter, Iphigenia, sacrificed to ensure a fair wind for the Greek troops to Troy. As visitors pass through the exhibit, something will happen – a ritual of a sort – and the audience will be whirled into a different world. Turn one way and you’ll be in Mycenae, the city of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra. The feel for this city is, as Vaughan says, “stark and epic and big”, with a classicising style that’s overlaid (because Punchdrunk never does things straightforwardly) with the aesthetic of Fritz Lang’s Metropolis – hints of 1920s art deco in a slightly sci-fi mode. Everywhere is brimming with details that might wash over you or might not, depending on what you pick up along the way, or what you know already. For example, there’s a metallic panel that depicts, if you have the eyes to see it, an eagle killing a pregnant hare, which is a portent described in the opening chorus of Agamemnon. Then Vaughan and Minns walk me through to Troy, where the feeling is instantly different. This part of the show, says Minns, is “much more bustling. There’s an atmosphere of decadence, of parties, of Weimar.” The level of detail is again almost bewildering. Later, Barrett tells me about the Japanese lanterns, for instance, that they’ve had made up – a nod to Yoshiwara, the nightclub in Lang’s Metropolis – with Linear B script written on them, but in the calligraphic style used for kanji. Finding someone who could render a text into the writing system of Mycenaean Crete was a task for their classical adviser, Emma Cole – who got the director of the scholarly institution the British School at Athens on the job. Vaughan and Minns take me up into a building and walk me through a series of rooms which, after a bit of prompting, I identify as spaces meant for, or perhaps recently vacated by, denizens of the Underworld’s prison of Tartarus: mythical characters such as Salmoneus, a king who insisted on being worshipped like a god and who imitated Zeus’s thunderbolts; or Ascalaphus, the guardian of Hades’ orchard, turned into a screech owl by the goddess Demeter after he revealed that Persephone, her daughter, had eaten a single pomegranate seed in the Underworld and was thus doomed to spend part of every year in that shadowy realm. No, neither of these characters are in Aeschylus’s Agamemnon or Euripides’ Hecuba, which are the core texts used by Barrett and choreographer and associate director Maxine Doyle; the layering-in of the realm of Hades is yet another palimpsest in what promises to be a dense and rich story. The show has been a long time in the making, Barrett tells me. It was back in 2010 that he and Doyle first thought about doing a version of the Trojan war story. But “we lost the building”, he says, “and we ended up doing The Drowned Man instead”. Doyle takes me back to basics to describe their approach to their chosen plays. “We take all of the characters of those texts, and the plot lines and the narrative beats. And we play with all of those to create something that’s almost like a set of film-script treatments for each character scene, and each character has about 11 or 12 scenes. Then we layer those stories on top of each other. We adhere very closely to the text, but we use it as a stimulus or a starting point to create an abstract language of dance and movement, and prop and gesture and action, and we take away the spoken word. And we focus much more on the sort of emotional and subtexts of pieces.” In so doing, they also draw on lots of other texts and research, which is also where Cole – a specialist in the reception of classical drama at Bristol University – comes in. “Just this morning, one of the dancers, who’s playing Apollo, asked me if I could give them any texts that feature Apollo and Artemis together,” Cole tells me, “because they wanted to look at the language that those two characters might have. Not just verbal, but how they engage with one another.” She gave them references from The Iliad and The Odyssey, and also told them about a tragedy about Niobe (“Lost, very sadly!”), whose children are killed by the arrow-wielding divine siblings. All along, says Barrett, Punchdrunk’s project has been about trying to hoick theatre out of the age-old formula in which “you go through the motions, you get the tickets, you sit down and wait for the curtain to come up, you’re physically inactive and only a small sliver of your brain is being used”. Their approach, “has been about trying to do the opposite of that, so it’s adrenaline-fuelled, the audience’s synapses are firing, they’re sensorily aware and actually having to make decisions about who they follow, or where they go, or what to avoid”. When The Burnt City opens, there will be a whole new generation of British theatregoers who haven’t seen the company’s large-scale work before; and a whole swathe of older audience members, starved of experiences by the various Covid confinements, who will doubtless be keen to give them another go. It will be intriguing to see whether the company can produce the frisson of freshness and excitement it did at the beginning of the century: whether the work still produces that feeling that Barrett lives for, that “the audience owns their show, and they’re alive in it”. The Burnt City is at 1 Cartridge Place, London, from 22 March to 28 August.",Arts/Stage,‘Adrenaline-fuelled’: Punchdrunk return with the horrifically timely siege of Troy,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/21/adrenaline-fuelled-punchdrunk-horrifically-timely-siege-troy
3/21/2022,"It was tempting, sitting there in your shorts and thongs over the weekend, to think all was well with the world, and with football. Footy loves a ‘great story’ and the opening round was replete with them. We watched a young man who’s endured two bouts of chemotherapy kick a goal at the MCG. We welcomed back another who has had to retrain his neural pathways, and who recently admitted “I was a shell of the person I was”. We drank in the joy and lunacy of Joe Daniher. In Jason Horne-Francis and Nick Daicos, we saw the future. After two years of cardboard cut-outs and fake crowd noise, we were gifted heaving crowds and high scores. But we also saw the industry at its worst. On Thursday, Fox Sports’ Tom Morris was sacked for what he conceded were “disgusting and disgraceful” comments about a work colleague, after recording emerged of him using homophobic and sexist language in reference to her. In the time it took to walk the dog, he went from the high moral ground to a figure of national opprobrium. It was not a good day to be a bloke with a press pass. It was not a good day to be a woman in the media, or a woman who loves sport. There was schadenfreude. There were straw men galore. And there were no winners. Apparently it was incumbent on everyone who had written an article – or even published a tweet condemning Beveridge – to go 10 times as hard at Morris. Apparently, you had to pick a side. One football reporter issued a statement from the Notes section of his iPhone, hoping that Morris wouldn’t be ‘permanently cancelled’. There was a common lament, echoed in Nicole Hayes’s piece today: ‘where are the men’s voices here?’, ‘why, after reacting as though the Beveridge press conference was the worst atrocity ever committed, have you all suddenly gone silent?’ and ‘why, just like in Canberra, is it women doing all the heavy lifting?’ I am hardly in a position to preach from the puritanical pulpit on this. Few are. But as a bloke, it was an opportune time to shut up, to listen, and to learn something. Most of us could safely say we would never denigrate a work colleague like that. But the tone, if not the content, was familiar to any man who has ever gathered in a group and run with the pack. It was a tone that scores of women referenced in post after post, in article after article. It is a tone that emerges when the veneer of professionalism is removed. Many said they do not feel safe or fully supported working in this industry. They are women who find it difficult to trust the men they work alongside, who constantly have to prove they belong and who are regularly belittled online. Kelli Underwood, a colleague of Morris, said she felt “sick in the stomach”. For men following this story, there was utter astonishment, followed by a certain shame. For women, it came as no surprise at all. There was just a simmering fury. Compared to the dark old days, the industry really has come a long way on this issue. But it was miles behind to begin with. Even now, you really don’t have to look hard. It was comprehensively laid out in Michael Warner’s The Boys’ Club, a book which was dismissed by the men running the game, and pretty much ignored by most mainstream media outlets. It is still there in the TV coverage, which rewards and promotes several men whose mere presence still sits uneasily, particularly for women. It is there whenever Daisy Pearce does special comments – both in the online detritus and the way her fellow callers talk over her. It is there in the ubiquitous betting ads – which pretty much fund Fox Sports – and where the men are blithering imbeciles and the women are eye-rollers and style-crampers. But this is not really a footy issue. It is an issue in every workplace in Australia. It is an issue in our national parliament. Indeed, Morris’s employers handled this more decisively, and more convincingly, than many of our leaders in Canberra. His apology was a decent one, free of weasel words. It was a lesson to many other prominent football and political figures who have transgressed, and whose apologies often boil down to “if anyone was offended … ”. On the ABC over the weekend, Underwood expressed surprise at how swiftly this was dealt with. She half expected Morris to be given a few weeks off, and quickly and quietly welcomed back into the club. For years in football, it was hard to know where the line was when it came to be being sacked. Well, the line is clear now. Maybe things will change this time. They sure as hell need to.",Sport/Sport,"The Tom Morris story made men feel utter astonishment, followed by a certain shame",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/21/the-tom-morris-story-made-men-feel-utter-astonishment-followed-by-a-certain-shame

3/21/2022,"India’s romantic hill station Darjeeling has evoked images of beautiful tea-growing gardens but also, for those who follow its politics, of industrial strikes and violent insurgencies. No more, says the leader of a new political party that swept to power in recent municipal polls, vowing to end years of agitation that have blighted the region’s main sources of income: tea and tourism. Ajoy Edwards, whose four-month-old Hamro party won 18 out of 32 seats in the local elections, is the charismatic former leader of the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) who went into exile from the region for long periods due to his times as an armed activist, and now says he wants to make progress on historical issues but ultimately get back to business. “We cannot keep doing what we have done for the past 35 years,” Edwards said. “Especially with strikes, as when we have long ones nothing really happens in the rest of Bengal yet our own people are driven into poverty.” The scenic town at the foot of the eastern Himalayas is famous not just for the “champagne of teas” but as a hotbed of tension between ethnic Bengalis and Gorkhas – Indians of Nepali origin. Gorkha separatist groups want a wholly autonomous region, free from the West Bengal state government in Kolkata, and this is often manifested in strikes by agricultural workers. Naturally this affects tea production, which in turn ravages the local economy. “Every time there is a revolution, things don’t go forward. We’re stuck. I mean the infrastructure is essentially still what the Britishers left us with,” Edwards said. “We are still drinking water from 100-year-old reservoirs and living in crumbling houses from that age. There’s a systemwide failure. We’ve just been putting screens on old windows for too long, without ever repairing the glass.” Edwards formed the Hamro party (Our party, in Nepali) last November after becoming estranged from his GNLF colleagues, preferring an onus on social work and a more centrist approach to the relative tub-thumping nationalism of the past. He narrowly missed out on winning the seat he stood for but he remains party chairman and is an adviser to the new municipal chair, and carries great influence. His former comrades have been somewhat scathing of his new persona but he appears unruffled. “A separate state for our people is something we can never lose sight of,” he said. “That’s part of my vision and part of my party’s vision. Having a homeland for the Gorkha people is an emotional demand that will always stay with me – just nothing violent.” In recent years tea production in Darjeeling has been plagued by industrial action. Strikes and protests that lasted almost a year in 2017 cost the Indian tea industry an estimated 2.5bn rupees (£25m). While Darjeeling accounts for about 7% of India’s total tea output, its luxury price tag at five to six times that of ordinary strands means it accounts for a disproportionately large share of income. The largest importer is Russia, followed by Iran. Edwards, whose family owns the picturesque Glenary’s bakery, which offers tea and cakes with breathtaking views from Darjeeling’s main drag, sees a chance to improve the wider economy by ending the region’s political turbulence and strikes. “Tea production has become so overtly politicised, workers’ wages are dismal. They have remained frozen in time. To earn decent living wages has become a thing of the past,” he said. “My own restaurant charges around 200 rupees for a pot of Darjeeling tea and it’s absurd that a daily tea worker can earn only around 180 rupees a day, picking the leaves for that pot. And all this means it is our women who end up doing the bulk of the tea garden work, as they can’t do alternative – and better-paying – labourer jobs so easily.” He is also acutely aware of the negative effects on tourism. He said there was a regular intake of visitors, “but it’s never been done at a proper, professional level. We need to market not just the town but the hamlets around it.” It remains to be seen whether he can deliver. Of his former comrades, he acknowledged rivalry remained. “We’ve been in a cycle of enmity both internally and with outsiders. We’re looking at ending that with proper diplomacy,” he said.",News/World news,Darjeeling unlimited: new party vows to end region’s strife,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/darjeeling-unlimited-new-party-vows-to-end-regions-strife
3/21/2022,"The corporate watchdog has warned Instagram and other social media influencers that they need a licence to give financial advice and face up to five years in jail if they break the law. In a new information sheet aimed at so-called “finfluencers”, issued on Monday, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) took aim at social media stock-tippers who promise big returns or promise the investments they recommend are as good as putting money in the bank. The regulator also warned influencers who earn money through affiliate links that send readers to online brokers that they may be providing a financial service, which also requires a licence. Financial influencers wield significant power among younger people looking to invest, with an Asic survey last year finding a third of Australians between 18 and 21 followed one on social media and that a further 64% reported changing their behaviour due to finfluencer posts. Influencers range from flashy Instagram star and Asic target Tyson Scholz, who depicts his life of luxury under the handle @asxwolf_ts, posting pictures of sports cars and a yacht he describes as his “mobile trading office”, through to earnest podcasters who provide advice on how to navigate the complex world of investing. This article includes content provided by Instagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. Asic is suing Scholz in the federal court, accusing him of operating a financial services business without a licence. The regulator said it suspects Scholz is doing so “by delivering training courses and seminars about trading in securities on the ASX”, as well as by offering stock tips and access to a Discord chat server named Black Wolf Pit. The Guardian understands Scholz is contesting Asic’s allegations and Scholz’s lawyers, Sydney firm Horton Rhodes, were contacted for comment. The case returns to court next month. “It is crucial that influencers who discuss financial products and services online comply with the financial services laws,” Asic commissioner, Cathie Armour, said. “If they don’t, they risk substantial penalties and put investors at risk.” Aleks Nikolic, a 27-year-old who hates the word “influencer” but posts financial investment content on Instagram, TikTok and Twitter under the moniker @brokegirlwealth, said Asic’s move brought welcome clarity. “I think it’s some of their clearest and best comms they’ve ever put out, potentially ever,” she said. She said financial influencers were often not lawyers and more akin to consumers than the institutions such as banks and brokers that traditionally give advice. “I think they’ve really taken on a lot of comment, that certainly I’ve made in the past, that it was confusing and the target market was sophisticated companies with legal teams that could craft policies,” she said. “Obviously everyone will now madly scramble to become compliant, but that was the point.” Nikolic, who does not have an Australian financial services licence, said she would take time to review her content to see if it needed to be changed. She said she would also need to decide whether to remove affiliate links on her site sending readers to an online broker. “I’m just glad they have been as prescriptive as they have been because they’ve put down some really clear guidelines for financial content producers,” she said. “I think we’ve already seen action by Asic against promoters that have pretty blatant consumer harm. We’ve seen crypto schemes, pump and dump schemes, people who have been building portfolios for people without having an Australian financial services licence.”",News/Australia news,"Unlicensed Instagram and TikTok influencers offering financial advice could face jail time, Asic warns",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/21/unlicensed-instagram-and-tiktok-influencers-offering-financial-advice-could-face-jail-time-asic-warns
3/21/2022,"The code of conduct adopted by digital platforms, including Facebook and Google, is “too narrow” to prevent all the harms of misinformation and disinformation, Australia’s media regulator has warned. The requirement that harm from social media posts must be both “serious” and “imminent” before tech companies take action has allowed longer term “chronic harms” including vaccine misinformation and the erosion of democracy, according to the Australian Communication and Media Authority. The Morrison government released Acma’s June 2021 report on the misinformation and disinformation code on Monday, promising to help boost the regulator’s power to demand information from digital platforms and give it reserve powers to create new rules for the industry. Labor accused the government of promising the new powers in the “dying days of the 46th parliament”. The code was drawn up by the Digital Industry Group Inc after the digital platforms inquiry in 2019. It is a form of self-regulation adopted in February 2021 by Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, TikTok, Redbubble, Apple and Adobe. Acma found that 82% of Australians report having seen Covid-19 misinformation over the past 18 months, warning that “falsehoods and conspiracies” online had undermined Australia’s public health response. Some 22% reported seeing “a lot” of misinformation online, with younger Australians most at risk. Misinformation was most common on larger digital platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, but “smaller private messaging apps and alternative social media services are also increasingly used to spread misinformation or conspiracies due to their less restrictive content moderation policies”, it said. Acma said misinformation “typically spreads via highly emotive and engaging posts within small online conspiracy groups” which were then “amplified” by local figures. The celebrity chef Pete Evans and the prominent anti-vaccine campaigner Taylor Winterstein topped the list of “influencers sharing misinformation narratives”, according to research commissioned from We Are Social. They have denied sharing misinformation but Evans has been removed from Facebook and Instagram. The United Australia Party MP Craig Kelly who was removed from Facebook for promoting unproven Covid treatments also featured on the list. Kelly denies sharing misinformation and has accused the social media platforms of interfering with his duties as an MP because he was unable to communicate with constituents through the platform. Acma said it was appropriate for digital platforms to apply a threshold that misinformation must be reasonably likely to cause “serious” harm before they censor posts. But the requirement that misinformation must also be “imminent” allows a narrow interpretation that “would likely exclude a range of chronic harms that can result from the cumulative effect of misinformation over time, such as reductions in community cohesion and a lessening of trust in public institutions”. It cited the 2021 Capitol riot in the US as “an example of the impact of longer-term chronic harms arising from the widespread belief in misinformation, and how this can spill over to the real-world as incitement to commit violent acts”. Digi dead-batted Acma’s call to remove the requirement that harm be “imminent” from the code, promising only to consider the recommendation when it reviews the code this year. “It is important to note that the code’s current approach does not preclude action on what might be described as chronic harms, and we’ve certainly seen signatories report action on these in their transparency reports,” a Digi spokesperson said. Acma asked for “formal information-gathering powers … to oversee digital platforms, including the ability to request Australia-specific data on the effectiveness of measures to address disinformation and misinformation” and “reserve powers” to introduce binding rules and codes of conduct. The communications minister, Paul Fletcher, agreed to those requests, arguing the latter would encourage the platforms to be “more ambitious” when revising the voluntary code. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Acma’s report highlights that disinformation and misinformation are significant and ongoing issues,” Fletcher said. “Digital platforms must take responsibility for what is on their sites and take action when harmful or misleading content appears.” Labor’s shadow communications minister, Michelle Rowland, and assistant minister, Tim Watts, said the government had failed to empower Acma “to act on misinformation and disinformation, despite evidence of it circulating online during the Black Summer bushfires, the Covid-19 pandemic and around elections”. Digi agreed “in principle” to the recommendations including the introduction of “reserve powers”. The industry body called for Acma’s role to include an “appeals mechanism in the event of disagreements in the final outcomes of complaints raised through Digi’s complaints portal”. Acma also called for private messaging services to be included within the scope of the code because they are “known vectors of disinformation and misinformation”.",News/Media,"Digital code of conduct fails to stop all harms of misinformation, Acma warns",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/21/digital-code-of-conduct-fails-to-stop-all-harms-of-misinformation-acma-warns
3/21/2022,"A motley train of shaggy-haired musicians is gliding into the future on a hastily sketched highway, brandishing bongos, vegetables and flaming guitars. The poster for a 1971 gig by German-English-Swiss trio Brainticket, on display at Berlin’s small Bröhan Museum until 24 April, visually sums up the essence of a German musical movement so forward-looking at its height, its country of origin is only now starting to recognise its legacy. The Krautrock Posters exhibition is a belated homage to the experimental soundscapes crafted in the late 1960s and early 1970s by bands like Neu!, Can, Guru Guru, Amon Düül II and Kraftwerk, who were channelling their classical training into rock music and novel electronic gadgets. The 40 posters on display span the scene’s roots in the counterculture moment of 1968, where some bands were mere support acts for earnest political debates; to the more playful reflections on national cultural identity of the late 70s and early 80s. In a poster for a 1975 Kraftwerk concert, the road to the future is a German autobahn populated by Volkswagen Beetles. “Krautrock was an emancipatory moment for German musicians,” said curator Gerd Siekmann, who attended his first gig by the band Birth Control as a 13-year-old in 1972. “For the first time they were liberating themselves from the monotony of traditional schlager music, while also breaking free of merely imitating the sounds of American jazz or English beat bands.” If Krautrock was a revolution, however, it also passed much of Germany by at the time, and was quickly semi-forgotten. The Bröhan show is the first exhibition in the country dedicated specifically to a German underground music scene that was first recognised as a coherent movement by the British music press. “Krautrock” is not a term that can be found on any of the posters in the show, which instead advertise “underground sounds”, “transcendental music” or “creative rock”. A slang word used by British and American soldiers for German troops during the second world war, the term originally had belittling undertones. But it gained an appreciative meaning after finding earnest champions in radio DJ John Peel and enthusiastic followers in musicians including David Bowie and Brian Eno. Most of the vintage krautrock posters Siekmann sells via his online shop these days, he said, are bought by fans outside Germany. The first definitive history of the movement, Krautrocksampler, was written by British writer Julian Cope in 1995. Part of the reason, Siekmann suggested, may be that the German pioneers did not care too much that at the time they were making musical history. Many of the bands he contacted to build his collection had simply not kept any merchandise from the period. “They were simply too focused on looking to the future rather than thinking about the present,” he said.",Arts/Art and design,Berlin Krautrock exhibition celebrates groundbreaking genre,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/21/berlin-krautrock-exhibition-celebrates-groundbreaking-genre
3/21/2022,"Lifted out of a plastic tub, the wasp factory is spread out, floor by dismantled floor, over the dining room table. The all-pervading smell of damp cardboard has evaporated, replaced by a mustiness, and what look like dried mushrooms sprout from the top of each egg tray layer. I expect all of the wasps to be gone.They are not. About a month ago, I stood on top of a ladder under the eaves in front of our sparrow nest box. A queen wasp had moved in the previous summer after the birds failed, and such was her demand for space that an extension spilled out of the nest hole, the entire face encrusted with papier-mache cells. I brushed them off, lifted the lid, then reached up and clawed out each tier of cells in turn, feeling each one pop free as it broke from its anchoring pedicels, the columns by which each layer hung from the one above. I dropped those honeycomb-like, near-weightless slabs from a great height, and collected them up. How does chew, spit and paste create such precision? The queen must work like a potter, for the tubular walls of her hexagonal cells show alternating shades of light brown, as if she had built them up one coil, one mouthful of rasped fence post, at a time. A potter with an inbuilt ruler, for the difference in diameter between each hexagon on the first tier is never as much as half a millimetre. And counting along and up, I estimate that about 700 workers made it from egg to adult from this one level. Other levels show mixed results. One has dozens of cells containing a tiny bead, each one the head of a larval grub, still attached to a shrivelled blackish body. Most trays have failures of metamorphosis. Some cells are capped with a white mesh, like funnel web spider webbing. Grubs spun these protective covers before pupating, only to be entombed. Strangest of all are a few burst membranes with just a head poking out, antennae poised. The birth of winged adults, readying for the maiden flight that never happened.
