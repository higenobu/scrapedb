1/28/2022,"A new species of insect has been found in the Ugandan rainforest that belongs to a group of insects so rare that its closest known relative was last seen more than 50 years ago. The species of leafhopper, named Phlogis kibalensis, was discovered by a British scientist doing field work in a national park in western Uganda.  The species has a metallic sheen and pitted body surface. It resembles other leafhoppers, particularly in its male reproductive organs, which are partly shaped like a leaf. Before this discovery, the last recorded sighting of a leafhopper from the Phlogis genus was in Central African Republic in 1969. Leafhoppers are closely related to cicadas but are smaller. They feed mainly on plant sap and are preyed on by invertebrates including spiders, beetles and parasitic wasps, as well as birds. “It’s the first time I’ve ever discovered a newly described species. Personally, it’s one of those things you aspire to do as an entomologist and I’ve managed to do it now,” said Dr Alvin Helden of Anglia Ruskin University, who found the species and has published the findings in the journal Zootaxa. “Phlogis kibalensis is a member of the leafhoppers. Most people are familiar with cicadas, and leafhoppers are related to cicadas. I usually describe them as much, much smaller. They all have the same overall structure; their head end is held slightly higher than their back end and they are quite colourful. “Leafhoppers of this genus, and the wider tribe, are very unusual in appearance, and are rarely found. In fact, they are so incredibly rare that their biology remains almost completely unknown. We know almost nothing about Phlogis kibalensis, the new species I found, including what plants it feeds on or its role in the local ecosystem.” Since 2015, Helden has been leading student field trips to the Kibale national park, close to Uganda’s border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. As part of this, Helden has been documenting the insects found in the park, making field guides which include photos of Kibale’s butterflies, hawkmoths and tortoise beetles. “I wanted to produce my own identification guide for the butterflies for my students, so they can see them on their phones or tablets. I thought it would also be useful for other international groups and Ugandan students,” said Helden. “There are so many species in the rainforest of the Kibale national park and you can get a list of species, but there aren’t enough pictures. The guides are helpful for people who want to put a name to things.”",News/Environment,British scientist finds new species of rare leafhopper in Uganda,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/27/british-scientist-finds-new-species-of-rare-leafhopper-in-uganda
1/28/2022,"Many more Covid restrictions are being lifted on Friday in Wales, allowing nightclubs to reopen and some rules on social distancing to be scrapped. But people will still be obliged to wear masks in most indoor places and on public transport while Covid passes will be needed for larger indoor events and gatherings.  The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said Wales was moving fully into alert level zero because the country had passed the peak of the Omicron wave. He said: “There are encouraging signs that cases of coronavirus may be starting to stabilise. But we all need to continue taking steps to stay safe – unfortunately the pandemic is not over yet. “We are moving to alert level zero and we will retain some important protections, such as face coverings in most indoor public places. Under the new regime:  Nightclubs can reopen.  The general requirement of 2m social distancing in all premises open to the public and workplaces will be removed.  The rule of six will no longer apply to gatherings in regulated premises, such as hospitality, cinemas and theatres.  Licensed premises will no longer need to only provide table service and collect contact details. The Covid pass will continue to be required to enter larger indoor events, nightclubs, cinemas, theatres and concert halls.  Working from home will “remain important” but it will no longer be a legal requirement.  Businesses, employers and other organisations must continue to undertake a specific coronavirus risk assessment and take reasonable measures to minimise the spread of coronavirus, which may include 2m social distancing or controlled entry.  Face-covering rules, which apply on public transport and in most public indoor places will remain in force, with the exception of hospitality settings such as restaurants, pubs, cafes and nightclubs.  Everyone must also continue to self-isolate if they test positive for coronavirus but the Welsh government has reduced the self-isolation period from seven to five full days. The Tories said it was positive there will be more freedoms, calling the restrictions that have been in place since Boxing Day “cruel and clinically unnecessary”. The shadow health minister Russell George said: “However, this does not mean the pain ends for all those who lost out due to the recent overzealous restrictions. Welsh hospitality traded a third down compared to England since Boxing Day. “The Labour administration in Cardiff Bay must tell the public when there will be no more alert levels in Wales as with normality in touching distance, we need dates on when we can learn to live with the virus with no further threats of lockdowns to deal with hypothetical variants. “This means removing harmful business restrictions, making face masks a matter of choice and self-responsibility, and scrapping coercive, ineffective, and pointless vaccine passports that still have no proof that they work. “While we are moving closer to freedom, we cannot forget that while restrictions such as vaccine passports remain in Wales, we are being limited by a Labour government in a way that stifles economic growth and creates social resentment.”",News/UK news,Wales set to lift most Covid restrictions after passing Omicron peak,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/27/wales-set-to-lift-most-covid-restrictions-after-passing-omicron-peak
1/28/2022,"The US coast guard said it would call off the search for survivors at sunset on Thursday if no new discoveries were made following a boat capsizing off the Florida coast at the weekend with 40 people on board. Four more bodies had been discovered, bringing the total to five, Capt Jo-Ann Burdian, commander of the coast guard’s Miami sector, said in a press conference on Thursday.  “We have found four deceased bodies in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to five deceased bodies that we have recovered. These victims have been in the water since Saturday,” she said. “I have made the very difficult decision, balancing everything that we know about unseen weather conditions, the number of people in the water, how confident we are in our search area… that at sunset this evening, we will suspend actively searching.” Burdian said the coast guard would no longer be dedicating assets specifically to the search although it would retain its on-water presence. Anthony Salisbury, of the Department of Homeland Security, spoke of the US authorities’ belief that a human smuggling operation had been underway and said: “As of right now, this is still an ongoing investigation… The goal of this investigation is to identify, arrest and prosecute any criminal or criminal organization that facilitated or profited from this doomed venture.” He added that the coast guard “hasn’t done any assessment” of the nationalities of the victims, and declined to disclose the nationality of the lone survivor so far. That lone survivor, found clinging to the hull of the overturned boat, said the boat capsized late Saturday. He said 40 people had set out for Florida from Bimini, an island in the Bahamas, the archipelago nation located around 300 miles east from the US coast. The survivor was taken to a hospital and was treated for dehydration and sun exposure symptoms. The victims were understood from the survivor’s account not to have had the benefit of life jackets. Burdian said the survivor had told rescuers that the boat sailed into a storm after leaving the Bahamas. “HSI [Homeland Security Investigations] is conducting a criminal investigation so our interest is obviously what he has to say about what happened to him. [We’re] viewing him as a victim right now,” Salisbury said in reference to the survivor. According to the United Nations’ International Organization for Migration, 1,194 migrants tried to reach Miami, Florida last October from Haiti, and were repatriated to Haiti. Haiti’s president Jovenel Moïse was assassinated last summer, sparking chaos in the country. The majority of asylum seekers who attempt to reach Florida via sea hail from Haiti and Cuba.",News/US news,Four more bodies found off Florida coast from capsized boat ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/27/florida-coast-capsized-boat
1/28/2022,"A revitalised Vivianne Miedema and Beth Mead breathed life back into Arsenal’s title challenge in a tough defeat of Brighton. Despite having earned just one win in their previous seven games, the Gunners are still top of the WSL and were able to extend their lead to four points here, albeit having played a game more than second-place Chelsea.  Their situation looked to be worsening when Emma Koivisto gave Brighton the lead in the first half but an energetic restart saw Mead provide an assist for Miedema from a free-kick on the left before scoring from a slightly more central set piece herself. Arsenal arrested a three-game losing streak on Sunday, with Tobin Heath’s stoppage-time equaliser ensuring Jonas Eidevall’s side took one point away from Manchester City’s Academy Stadium. It was an important strike that capped off a gutsy performance – something that has been lacking recently – and was the Gunners’ first goal since an own goal in their 4-1 defeat to Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on 15 December. Heath was rewarded for her heroics with a second WSL start in an Arsenal shirt, having made two substitute appearances since her return from a calf injury. Also included in the starting lineup, much to the relief of Arsenal fans, was the centre-back Leah Williamson, who went to ground in the first half against Man City before being substituted at half-time as the Gunners manage her return from a hamstring problem. Full debuts were also handed to the new defensive signings Rafaelle Souza and Laura Wienroither, with the former partnering Williamson after impressing when coming on in her place on the weekend, and the latter at left-back in place of the suspended Katie McCabe, who picked up her fifth yellow card of the season at Manchester City. Hope Powell’s Brighton were in the middle of a goal drought far worse than Arsenal’s before kick-off. The Seagulls had gone five league games without a goal: their last scorer was Maisie Symonds in the 1-0 defeat of Leicester on 14 November. In the 15th minute though Brighton’s fortunes looked brighter, with Koivisto leaping highest between Wienroither and Miedema. With her back to goal, Koivisto sent a looping header beyond the goalkeeper Manuela Zinsberger to give her side the lead. After a bright start to the season Brighton had not won in seven WSL games but were ahead against the league leaders, having also secured a 0-0 draw against Chelsea at Kingsmeadow on Sunday. “I expect Brighton to work very, very hard,” said Eidevall before kick-off. “They are organised, they try to hit you on the counterattack, they are strong on set pieces and a good crossing team. It’s about controlling their threats. They get good numbers into the box when they cross the ball and it’s about limiting those moments and defending them when they happen.” Having predicted the threat Arsenal had failed to deal with it and, despite their dominance in possession, were undone by another smart set piece that would energise their opponents. But whatever was said between the home side at half-time worked. The Arsenal players emerged from the dressing room with the bit between their teeth and kept Brighton pinned in their own half. In the 55th minute they equalised in style. After being clattered just outside the area by Maya Le Tissier, Mead stepped up and swung a free-kick towards the back post. Williamson missed but it was turned in by the alert Miedema behind her. Five minutes later the Gunners doubled their tally and the source was familiar. Mead and Miedema stood over the ball for a free-kick outside the box but it was the former who stepped forward, beautifully curving her strike round the wall and into the far corner beyond Megan Walsh in the Brighton goal. Miedema and Mead, so potent in Arsenal’s early charge to the top of the table, looked transformed. Playing more centrally and not dipping deep as much, Miedema went from one touch in the box in the first half to being much more of a presence.
