1/24/2022,"The UK’s biggest private pension fund will move £5bn of its investment in equities to an index avoiding the worst polluters, in a move that will immediately reduce the carbon emissions associated with the shareholdings by 30%. The Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), which manages the pensions of British academics, will introduce a climate “tilt” to the money, shifting it to companies that are making efforts to cut emissions.  USS owns assets worth £82bn on behalf of 470,000 members from 330 of the UK’s higher education institutions, of which 40% is held in equities. It is facing pressure from members to decarbonise, as well as a separate dispute over proposals to cut pension benefits that could lead to strike action. The £5bn stake will move to Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), which will invest it according to a climate transition index developed by Solactive, a German company. The passively held investments have previously been managed by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, to reflect indices by MSCI. The move will also cut management costs. As well as the initial 30% fall in emissions associated with the investment, Solactive will ensure that portfolio carbon emissions fall by 7% every year thereafter. Crucially, this calculation will take into account emissions associated with companies’ products, such as oil or gas sold by fossil fuel producers. “We think this is a significant first step,” said Simon Pilcher, the chief executive of USS Investment Management, which manages the pension scheme’s money. “We are committed to the ultimate decarbonisation of the total assets. “Our conviction though is that for that total decarbonisation to happen, it is the underlying companies and the way in which the world operates that have to change. So we are not going to exclude our way to net zero. We have to help the businesses in which we invest.” Although the move affects just part of the scheme’s shareholdings, a spokesperson said more of the portfolio was expected to be moved to climate-aware indices in future. The Church of England’s pensions managers last week showed how a similar approach could work in practice, announcing they would sell some shares in 28 fossil fuel producers that had not shown clear evidence of plans to reduce emissions. USS has faced persistent criticism from some of its members for holding large stakes in major carbon emitters, including oil companies such as Shell and other companies that are dependent on burning fossil fuels, such as Heathrow airport. The campaign group Divest USS argues that the scheme has not done enough to vote in favour of climate-focused shareholder resolutions. Paul Kinnersley, an emeritus professor at Cardiff University and a coordinator of the group, highlighted the fact that USS members included large numbers of climate scientists and other academics who would probably favour rapid divestment. “Any shift by USS to decarbonise or clean up their investments is obviously a step in the right direction,” he said, “but they’ve been slow about changing and they’ve been slow about sharing detail on the target of net zero by 2050. We’re welcoming it, but there’s a long way for them to go.” The move could be seen as a blow to BlackRock as it pushes climate-friendly policies, although Pilcher said BlackRock would continue to manage some USS assets. Neither will it make much of a dent in BlackRock’s total assets under management, which rose above $10tn (£7.4tn) at the end of 2021 – the first time any investor has reached that size. In relation to the dispute over pension contributions, the University and College Union said on Friday that it would set dates for members to strike in the coming days unless USS and employers back down on proposals to cut guaranteed benefits and increase member contributions. The union argues it would be unaffordable for members.",News/Business,UK’s biggest private pension fund to shift £5bn away from polluters,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/23/uks-biggest-private-pension-fund-to-shift-5bn-away-from-polluters
1/24/2022,"UK taxpayers could have to pay as much as £1bn in compensation to former Post Office workers wrongly convicted of theft due to the defective Horizon IT system. The system, which was installed by the Post Office and supplied by Fujitsu, falsely suggested there were cash shortfalls, leading to 736 unsafe convictions for theft, fraud and false accounting in what is one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British legal history.  The Post Office has said it cannot afford to foot the huge cleanup bill for the scandal and last month the government, the service’s only shareholder, confirmed the taxpayer would step in. This weekend new details of the potential magnitude of the compensation programme emerged. The Post Office Scandal blog by the journalist Nick Wallis, who has written a book on the fiasco, reported that the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has now made three grants available to the Post Office that total just over £1bn. The most recent grant, made last month, was for £686m, and came on top of previous awards of £94m and £233m. In his post, first reported by the Sunday Times, Wallis said the figures involved meant the Post office Horizon IT disaster was now a “fully fledged £1bn scandal”. Between 2000 and 2014, the Post Office prosecuted 736 post office operators based on information from a recently installed computer system called Horizon. Some of the workers were jailed following convictions for false accounting and theft, and many were financially ruined. However, it was the software, which contained bugs, errors and defects, that had caused the problems, according to the high court judgment that quashed many of the convictions. So far, the Post Office has offered compensation to 777 of the 2,500 subpostmasters who have applied. Those who had convictions overturned have been offered interim payments of £100,000 while their claims are assessed. A spokesperson for BEIS said the subsidy figures were a “top estimate of what could be needed. It has not been spent and will only be given to the Post Office in arrears if and when required.”",News/Business,UK taxpayers to pay former Post Office workers up to £1bn compensation,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/23/taxpayer-to-pay-former-post-office-workers-up-to-1bn-compensation
1/24/2022,"For a while, it felt as if Liverpool were about to let another Premier League title slip from their grasp at Selhurst Park. Jürgen Klopp’s exhausted side looked as if they were playing on fumes. Nine of them had played a gruelling League Cup semi-final against Arsenal on Thursday night. Two nights’ sleep, some ice packs, some light training, and then back on the bus. Crystal Palace were 2-1 down but well on top. Chances came and went.  But Liverpool held on. They even managed to burgle a third goal, a richly undeserved penalty converted by Fabinho to give them a little breathing space. Now they can rest up a little, recharge their batteries, welcome back Mo Salah and Sadio Mané from international duty. It is a full 18 days until their next league fixture. This was their one last push, and it means we still, just about, have a title race. Liverpool were scrappy but decisive when it mattered. Virgil van Dijk and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain got the two crucial first-half goals. Jordan Henderson was magnificent in midfield. Curtis Jones never stopped. Trent Alexander-Arnold was beginning to puff even before the end of the first half, but in the dying minutes somehow still managed to produce the pass of the match, a devastating 60-yard diagonal ball from which Diogo Jota won the late penalty. As for Palace, it was a familiar story: a nice performance, hampered by their irritating habit of finding themselves 2-0 down after half an hour. Again they were forced to chase the game after those two early goals. Many of their problems appear to be structural: an absence of clear authority at the back (the superb Joachim Andersen aside) and that well-known weakness at set pieces. Palace are not a big team, and so when that slight physical disadvantage is compounded by individual errors and positional indiscipline, they possess not so much a defence as a welcome mat. Take Liverpool’s first goal for starters: seven minutes in, van Dijk was able to run from the D to the near post unimpeded to launch a thunderous header that Vicente Guaita could do nothing about. You could point the finger at Odsonne Édouard, supposedly marking the near post but oblivious to Van Dijk’s movement, or perhaps someone further back in the chain. But it is becoming too frequent a problem to be accidental. The second goal was different. In the buildup Édouard and Michael Olise had temporarily switched wings, and so as Andy Robertson advanced from halfway to the edge of the Palace penalty area, no one really seemed sure who was supposed to be stopping him. The left-back Tyrick Mitchell drifted too far into the centre, Oxlade-Chamberlain was unmarked at the back post and even had time to take a touch before slamming the ball low past Guaita. Again: multiple errors, one entirely foreseeable result. Then again Patrick Vieira has always believed that the best defence is having the ball. And it was no surprise that the more they saw of it, the more secure they looked. Their second-half resurgence had its origins towards the end of the first, as Liverpool began to tire and Palace began to puncture a few holes in their back line. Olise had a shot saved from a tight angle, Jean-Philippe Mateta breaking the offside trap, Alisson just managing to get fingers to his shot. Within a minute of the restart Conor Gallagher – quiet in the first half – had headed wide from four yards. Finally, on 55 minutes, an opening. Joël Matip headed poorly out of defence, Jeffrey Schlupp carved open a ragged Liverpool with one pass and Édouard was able to tap into an empty net after Mateta’s unselfish lay-off. It was Nick Hornby who once theorised that crowds were at their loudest when their team was losing but playing well. And as Selhurst Park belatedly found its voice, having spent much of the first half grumbling about the referee, so it proved here. Vieira decided to go for the throat. Eberechi Eze came on, followed later by Jordan Ayew and Christian Benteke as Palace essentially went to an attacking 4-2-4. Meanwhile Liverpool were desperately trying to take some oxygen out of the game. Klopp had introduced Takumi Minamino on the hour, but in reality there was little else he could do. Henderson does not get tired, of course, and Jota was still gamely running the channels. But too many Liverpool players didn’t really want the ball, could no longer sprint after it, were starting to play for time. With eight minutes remaining Olise got a run on Robertson from Anderson’s long ball and tried to lob the ball over Alisson, who chased furiously after it. This was it: the title race right there. Alisson desperately pawed the ball clear, earning himself a bang on the goalpost as he did so, and that close shave finally seemed to convince Liverpool to knuckle down. With four minutes left Alexander-Arnold looked up and pinged the ball 65 yards on to Jota’s toes. The flagging Jota couldn’t quite bring the ball under control. But as Guaita closed in, he had an even better idea. It was a terrible decision by referee Kevin Friend, who even with the benefit of his own eyes, the VAR and several replays failed to spot that Jota had veered to the right in order to engineer a collision with Guaita, who could do little about it. Still, Liverpool were content to take whatever they could get. And for all Palace’s chagrin at the end, this was a game lost at its start, not at its beginning. Before Liverpool’s second goal, possession was 30-70 in Liverpool’s favour. After, it was 51-49. If only, Vieira will reflect, they had started playing a little earlier.",Sport/Football,Disputed Fabinho penalty seals win as Liverpool quash Crystal Palace revival,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/23/crystal-palace-liverpool-premier-league-match-report
1/24/2022,"A 67-year-old British woman who planned to return to Britain with her 80-year-old French husband after 30 years in France has told how Home Office delays have left them waiting almost a year for the Brexit paperwork they need to set foot in the country. Artists Carmel and her husband Louis sold their house last year and packed up all their belongings last summer having read that it would take 15 days to get a family permit.  The pensioners applied for the paperwork on 22 April last year and but have been been in limbo for 10 months camping out with their children and unable to get on with their lives despite their advancing years. “We packed everything up. We sold the house. And it’s just non communication from the Home Office. “My husband went through a phase of being very depressed about the whole thing. He said, ‘what are the home office waiting for, for me to die sort of thing?’” said Carmel, who asked that her and her husband’s real names were not used. “I think we’ve got to the point of disbelief. We are in this situation but how are we in this situation?” said Carmel who said she has had a very happy 30 years in France with her husband but just wants to return home. “We feel like we are a victim of Brexit and there is nothing we can do about it. We are just waiting. We can’t get on with our lives,” she says. Carmel is one of thousands of British citizens living in Europe furious that their rights have been compromised because of Brexit despite government promises to the contrary. Her case comes to light as the campaign group British in Europe has written to four secretaries of state including Liz Truss and Priti Patel begging them to deliver Conservative party promises that British citizens in the EU would not suffer an erosion of rights because of Brexit. It has urged the four cabinet members which also include work and pensions secretary Thérèse Coffey and education secretary Nadhim Zahawi not to forget the 1.2 million British citizens in Europe and warning them of four potential risks they face because of Brexit. Theese include ongoing issues for British citizens trying to return home and a call for them to extend a 29 March deadline for applications for those non-UK spouses to apply for settled status. It also wants them to answer a request to issue a “clear statement that those family members who are entitled to enter the UK on a visitor permit will be able to do so in order to move physically to the UK” to make the application to remain under the EU settlement scheme. It is thought there are thousands of British nationals waiting for permits to make the move home permanent but the Home Office has declined freedom of information requests and parliamentary questions from the former Brexit select committee chair Hilary Benn, Labour MP for data. British in Europe is closing after six years at the Brexit frontline because it has been unable to secure funds. In its valedictory letter it tells the cabinet members that support for Britons is needed more than ever. It has urged Truss and her colleagues to scrap the decision to cancel dedicated funding in embassies and consular posts to support British citizens in the EU and the European Economic Area arguing that they need dedicated officers in post until at least the end of 2022. It has also urged them to implement the seven-year grace period on home fees and student finance for children of British people living in Europe and to ensure potential changes to the personal independence payments do not impact recipients in the EU. Their letter was sent ahead of a meeting on Monday of UK and EU officials sitting on a Brexit specialised committee on citizens rights.

1/24/2022,"If Brighton could just play all their games from the 80th minute, then Manchester City might have more serious competition for the Premier League title. Danny Welbeck’s latest deserved equaliser earned Graham Potter’s team their 12th draw of the season as Leicester City again fell away in the latter stages. With Potter watching on remotely from his Covid-enforced isolation, Brighton could once again be proud of their strong finish as they extended their unbeaten run to six games since Christmas. Going behind to the prolific Patson Daka, Brighton came back to score for the eighth time in the last 10 minutes of matches, a statistic to which only the Premier League leaders can hold a candle.  If this was not quite the nightmare Leicester suffered on Wednesday, when Tottenham came from 2-1 behind in the 95th minute to win 3-2, then it was another instance of how stretched they are. Leicester still had nine players missing but had looked more defensively secure for the returns of James Justin, for his first game in 347 days after his serious knee injury, and Daniel Amartey, back from the Africa Cup of Nations. To be fair — and forgive us if you have heard this one before — Brighton’s finishing potency did not match their fine approach play for the first 80 minutes. This was their fourth draw in six matches, albeit including a pair of 1-1s with Chelsea, but while the visiting side displayed some admirable dexterity in their passing through the thirds they had so little to show for it until they went behind. They only had Neil Maupay’s mishit attempted scissor-kick and Alexis Mac Allister’s shot, clearing the crossbar by some distance, in a quiet first half. All hot air and no end product, as one regular sage summarised. Most of Leicester’s best moments flowed through James Maddison again. Their No10, tripped by his opposite number, curled the ensuing free-kick into the side-netting; 10 minutes before half-time, he dispossessed Mac Allister and when the recalled Harvey Barnes slipped the ball wide, Ademola Lookman should have scored but Robert Sánchez was allowed to save his shot. The volume on the PA system seemed to be pumped up as the players came out for the second half and within 28 seconds of the Posthorn Gallop inspiring the home team, Leicester had the lead. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall won a header to set Maddison running at the Brighton defence and, after he slipped the ball into the feet of Lookman, the attacking midfielder kept running to take a return. Maddison’s mishit shot deflected off Dan Burn for Barnes and although Sánchez saved the winger’s scuffed effort, the ball fell neatly for Daka to shoot in from the left edge of the six-yard box. It was the Zambian’s eighth goal involvement in his past eight Premier League games. Mac Allister again skied a shot high over the bar as Brighton rallied. Billy Reid, Potter’s assistant taking charge for the day, attempted to get their side playing higher up the field by switching to three at the back, introducing Tariq Lamptey at right wing-back, and Welbeck alongside Maupay up front, with Leandro Trossard just behind. Rodgers responded promptly by introducing Marc Albrighton to play right wing-back, with Justin moving inside as a third centre-back. Instead of protecting the lead, this served to invite Brighton on and Lamptey made a big difference, with his pace and invention. From his cross 17 minutes from time, Welbeck’s deft header required an excellent save down at his near post from Kasper Schmeichel. So it was no surprise when Welbeck did head home, at the far post from Maupay’s right-wing centre, eight minutes from time and Leicester, lilting, looked there for the taking. Youri Tielemans headed off the line from Burn’s towering header and Trossard ran through on to substitute Solly March’s superb pass only for Schmeichel to again save brilliantly, this time low to his right.",Sport/Football,Danny Welbeck earns point for draw specialists Brighton at Leicester,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/23/leicester-brighton-premier-league-match-report
1/24/2022,"Marc Skinner would not be drawn on whether Manchester United were now challenging for the title after a 3-0 defeat of Tottenham put them second in the Women’s Super League, albeit having played two games more than third-placed Chelsea.  “Title contenders? Only if we keep winning games,” he said. “We’ve got Bridgewater next, nothing else. If we take our eyes off them it can hurt us.” It has taken time for the United players to find their flow under Skinner. Despite his WSL pedigree, having arguably overperformed with a threadbare squad at Birmingham City before moving to Orlando Pride, there was frustration among fans early into his tenure. With his style of play and, seemingly, an inability to get the best out of United’s previous highest achievers, he had doubters aplenty. However, if Skinner’s two-and-a-half years in the US showed anything it was that patience would likely pay off. At the close of the manager’s first campaign in the States, Orlando Pride had slumped to their lowest ever points tally and sat rock bottom of the NWSL table. By the time he departed for Manchester, the Pride had picked up 15 points from their opening seven games of the season, a club record. Having been unable to string together back-to-back victories since the team’s opening two games of the season, taking in all competitions, United are now six games without a defeat. It’s a feat they have not achieved since a run of six wins completed their 2018-19 season in the women’s Championship, in what was the team’s first season after it was relaunched by the club. Skinner’s insistence on sticking to a regular XI despite results is paying dividends now, and the synergy to their play continued to impress at a bitterly cold Leigh Sports Village against Tottenham. In the reverse fixture, forward Alessia Russo’s first-half goal was cancelled out by a 95th-minute equaliser from Ria Percival. In Manchester there was no such profligacy up front or complacency at the back from United. Despite United’s dominance, Tottenham had gone closest just prior to the first goal, when forward Rachel Williams sent the ball across the face of goal but Jess Naz could not quite connect. This time, though, they were two goals clear by the halfway mark, with Vilde Bøe Risa prodding in at the back post from a Katie Zelem corner and then Hayley Ladd sending a thumping header past Spurs keeper Tinja-Riikka Korpela. The third made light work of the Tottenham defence, with Spurs also unbeaten in their five games prior to this fixture. United forward Martha Thomas dinked the ball over Molly Bartrip, Ashleigh Neville missed her attempt to clear, and Leah Galton poked it over the line at the far post. Perhaps more impressive than United’s six wins is the six clean sheets, with 13 goals conceded in the eight league games prior to this run. With centre-back stalwart Millie Turner out for an indefinite period after the club announced that “recent medical investigations revealed an issue with the artery in her neck”, there was a risk that the newfound solidity would be disrupted. Instead, Aoife Mannion marshalled the back line and stand-in Maria Thorisdottir played excellently in her absence. “It’s what we built when we were successful at Birmingham, teams are built on clean sheets,” said Skinner. “The thing with Birmingham was it was about the block and resilience, with this team it’s more. I like our energy in keeping clean sheets in that we’re not having to defend for our lives. For us, it’s about being in that game at zero so we can grow.”",Sport/Football,Leah Galton seals emphatic WSL win for Manchester United against Spurs,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/23/manchester-united-tottenham-wsl-match-report
1/24/2022,"Bernie Sanders on Sunday sought to turn fire aimed by Democrats at two of their own, Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, onto Republican senators he said were “pushing an anti-democratic agenda”.  “Republicans are laughing all the way to election day,” the Vermont senator told CNN’s State of the Union. “They have not had to cast one bloody vote which shows us where they’re at.” But the Vermont progressive also confirmed that he will campaign against Manchin and Sinema, both Democrats, should they face viable primary challengers. Manchin, from West Virginia, and Sinema, from Arizona, have blocked Democratic priorities including the Build Back Better spending plan and, this week, voting rights reform. Their refusal to contemplate reform to the filibuster, the rule which requires 60-vote majorities for most legislation, meant two voting rights bills in answer to Republican attacks on voting in states were always doomed to fail. On Saturday, Sinema was formally censured by her state party. Sanders said he supported that move. He also confirmed his threat to campaign against Sinema and Manchin in 2024. “If there was strong candidates prepared to stand up for working families who understand that the Democratic party has got to be the party of working people, taking on big money interests, if both candidates were there in Arizona and West Virginia, yes, I would be happy to support them.” But, Sanders insisted, “it’s not only those two. It is 50 Republicans who have been adamant about not only pushing an anti-democratic agenda but also opposing our efforts to try to lower the cost of prescription drugs, trying to expand Medicare … to improve the disaster situation in home healthcare, in childcare, to address the existential threat of climate change. “You’ve got 50 Republicans who don’t want to do anything except criticise the president and then you have, sadly enough, two Democrats who choose to work with Republicans rather than the president, and it will sabotage the president’s effort to address the needs of working families in this country.” Speaking to NBC’s Meet the Press, Sanders insisted the Biden administration made “a great start”, in part with a Covid relief bill passed with just 50 votes and the casting vote of Vice-President Kamala Harris, but was now bogged down thanks in large part to Manchin and Sinema. “The president and the Democratic Congress,” Sanders said, “… looked at the economic crisis that was caused by Covid. We passed the American Rescue Plan … and we also passed along the way the strongest infrastructure bill that has been passed since Dwight D Eisenhower … We were off to a great start. “And then I will tell you exactly what happened. Fifty members of the Republican party decided that they were going to be obstructionist … and then you had two United States senators joining them, Mr Manchin and Senator Sinema. “For five months now there have been negotiations behind closed doors trying to get these two Democratic senators on board. That strategy, in my view, has failed. It has failed dismally. We saw it last week in terms of the Voting Rights Act. We now need a new direction.” Asked if he was frustrated, Sanders told CNN he was. But, he insisted, “we need to start voting. We need to bring important pieces of legislation that impact the lives of working families right onto the floor of the Senate. And Republicans want to vote against lowering the cost of climate change, home healthcare, whatever it may be. And if the Democrats want to join them, let the American people see what’s happening. “Then we can pick up the pieces and pass legislation.” Some Democrats advocate splitting Joe Biden’s Build Back Better plan into separate bills, in order to pass what they can. Sanders conceded that most such legislation will not pass, given Republican obstruction and the machinations of Manchin and Sinema. Bringing bills to the floor, he conceded, would really be about electoral politics ahead of midterms this year in which Republicans expect to take back the House and possibly the Senate, and the presidential contest in two years’ time. “Once we know where people are at,” he said, “then we can say, ‘All right, look, we have 50 votes here, we have just one vote here, 49 votes here. “But what has bothered me very much is Republicans are laughing all the way to election day. They have not had to cast one bloody vote, or two, which shows us where they’re at.

1/24/2022,"Icicles were glued on to vintage streetlamps as Glasgow was transformed into a wintry Gotham City over the weekend, as Batgirl became the latest blockbuster to take advantage of Scotland’s versatile urban locations and glorious scenery. Last summer the city was draped in US flags and bunting to simulate a New York parade for the latest Indiana Jones movie, while the stars of the Amazon Prime series Good Omens 2 have been spotted recently in Edinburgh.  For Screw, the flagship new-year drama by STV Studios for Channel 4, the inside of Glasgow’s Kelvin Hall – now host to a £11.9m television studio jointly funded by the Scottish government and Glasgow city council – was transformed into a prison wing. “Scotland is now at a critical mass of screen production, both for television and cinema,” says the Scottish government’s culture minister, Angus Robertson, who declares he is the first in his role to be able to say to a younger generation interested in screen careers “that they will be able to work throughout their lives in film and TV production in Scotland”. Industry figures acknowledge a significant change from the previous decade, when there was deep frustration at a lack of funding and infrastructure, institutional neglect and a talent drain when compared with competitors in Ireland, Northern Ireland and Wales. The funding body Screen Scotland, formed in 2018 and helmed by the much-admired Isabel Davis, is credited with leading the change. As a result, Scotland is now far better placed to participate in the global post-pandemic content boom. But how does this frenetic activity affect homegrown Scottish film, and the development of talent and skills over the coming generation? “My optimistic take is that this influx of bigger international productions will have a positive effect”, says Ben Sharrock, the writer and director of the award-winning Limbo, a comedy-drama about a group of asylum seekers waiting out their claims on a remote Scottish island, and one of the most successful independent Scottish films of recent years. “It could lead to more skills training and more studio space, and will allow the Scottish industry to grow in a sustainable way. But it is important that smaller independent productions don’t end up being bottom-feeders.” It’s a concern shared by the film-maker Hope Dickson Leach, whose stage-and-screen hybrid of Jekyll and Hyde will be livestreamed from Leith theatre in Edinburgh next month. She says the local industry is “at a crunch point”. “There’s masses going on, which is great, but these massive productions which are staying in the country longer do cause a resource issue for crew, cast and even equipment for smaller budget and independent films,” she says. Dickson Leach, a founder of the campaigning organisation Raising Films, which support parents and carers in the sector, says any expansion in Scotland must go hand in hand with moves to address inclusion. “[The trade union] Bectu is working on job sharing, and there are discussions about shorter working hours, but it’s a long haul.” “This is the busiest I’ve know it in 30 years in the industry,” says Dave Arrowsmith, a production designer who was part of the team that secured the Cumbernauld unit that became the studio for the series Outlander in 2013, and recently built the set for Screw. “But the flipside is we still need more studio space.” Scotland has four studios, as well as the Kelvin Hall development, but Arrowsmith says this is simply not enough to cope with demand. “The boom is great, but Scotland is missing out of so much more additional work. Big productions come and do their Scottish bit in Glasgow city centre or landscape locations, then go back to England to complete the studio filming. We need public and private investment in a big 10- or 12-stage studio space.” The veteran producer Chris Young, who achieved huge success with the Inbetweeners before relocating his company to Skye, where he now champions emerging talent and Gaelic-language work, says there remains “a lack of ambition for promoting our own talent and stories in Scotland”. “It’s no easier to get new talent and writers off the ground,” he says. “If you look at Scottish prose and poetry, there’s an incredible amount of new work, so why is the equivalent not happening with film?” For Ben Sharrock, there’s also the hope that visible film-making will spur young Scots to tell their own stories. He says: “For me growing up, I didn’t know anyone that had a job making films. So if people on the streets of Glasgow or Edinburgh are seeing these films being made, maybe it will make them think ‘I could do something like that’. “But grassroots education is important, so kids aren’t growing up thinking film has to be a massive CGI-fest. They need to understand there are other stories and different forms, and there has to be support for the independent cinemas that show those to a younger audience.”",News/UK news,Glasgow becomes Gotham for Batgirl as Scottish film industry booms,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/23/glasgow-becomes-gotham-for-batgirl-as-scottish-film-industry-booms
