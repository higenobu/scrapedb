3/29/2022,"Budget headlines are like book covers. At best, you’ll get an initial indication of what you’re in for – horror or humour. But you really won’t know what all the fuss is about till you get stuck in to the gory details. This year, budget is coming early. As with every year, we can expect some government preening about budgetary positions: we are the only ones who could have managed such wonderful numbers in such challenging times. Then there will be a rebuttal. Whether it’s commentators or the opposition, someone will raise the spectre of debt and deficit. How can you trust a government that has plunged the economy into debt? Surely this is a sign of economic mismanagement. Both lines are old furphies. Budget headline figures are no more a measure of politicians’ economic savvy than the value of someone’s car is a measure of their ability to drive it. Why? The majority of government revenue and spending is automatic. On the revenue side, look no further than taxes. The majority of federal government revenue (around 65% in 2021-22) comes from personal income and company taxes. When wages rise (albeit not fast enough to meet inflation), the government gets more money. This year the government will get windfall tax revenues from mining profits; war against the Ukraine has seen commodity prices boom. Most of the biggest expenses are also automatic. Aside from transfers to the states, the largest line-items for government are pensions (over $50bn) and Medicare payments ($29bn). Once someone is eligible, payment is guaranteed at a preset amount. Taxes and welfare payments operate as automatic stabilisers. Taxes cool the economy when it’s running too hot, and welfare payments serve as fuel when the economy is struggling. All of this happens without politicians saying boo. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t care about the budget. Governments are some of the biggest entities in this country. The commonwealth government employs nearly a quarter of a million people – more than the large supermarket chains. Nearly one in every three dollars is spent by government. So, while most of government spending (and earning) is automatic, its choices matter. Small changes for government can mean big shifts for businesses and individuals. Think about the impact of changes to funding for various university degrees, or how many people installed solar during the rebate program. It’s not likely we will see a jobkeeper or NDIS-scale program on the papers this budget night. However, it is unmistakably an election year. While the economy is growing, it’s still getting back on its feet. Cost-of-living pressures are real and growing. Maybe money can’t buy love, but spending can buy votes – or so politicians hope. Put these things together and it’s a safe bet that the chequebook will be out. Speculation to date is focused on booze and bowsers. If the whispers are right, cheques will be made out to motorists (cutting or freezing the fuel excise) and beer drinkers (cutting the draught beer excise). We will also get an important sense of just how big the pre-election promises are likely to be. Each budget contains a line for “contingency reserves”. One part of contingency reserves is “decisions taken but not yet announced”. This is code for new spending that the government has decided on but does not yet want to disclose. The number is reliably largest in the period before an election. Like an advent calendar, we can expect to be drip-fed goodies once an election is announced. If you really want to test a government on their economic chops, don’t focus on debt and deficit numbers. Instead, look at what extras they spend on, how and over which period. At the very least, economic managers should follow good policy process. That means properly evaluating an initiative before it is introduced, and re-evaluating its effectiveness after a set period of time. Alas, politicians of both stripes have a bad habit of not following the government’s own guidelines – especially when it comes to elections. Good economic managers will invest in initiatives which support productivity, participation and/or population. They are mindful of externalities (like environmental impacts) and unintended consequences (such as implications for equity) of their ideas. A good economic manager does not kick the can too far down the road. New spending commitments should be funded, rather than leaving a budget hangover for future governments (or generations) to worry about. Initiatives should have a use-by date, or be set to a fixed cap. We want to avoid dripping taps – particularly until the effectiveness of a policy is proven. And then there’s great. Great economic managers are leaders. They are the ones who can look past self-interest and the next date in the political timetable. They focus on tackling an ever-growing list of wicked problems. Decarbonisation, demographic shifts, technology changes, equity and equality to name a few. That’s what I’ll be hoping for on budget night. Jessica Mizrahi is an economic consultant and commentator.

3/29/2022,"A former Australian soldier has objected to answering questions about how many SAS missions he went on under the command of Ben Roberts-Smith in Afghanistan in 2012, his lawyer telling the federal court his expected evidence could incriminate him in an alleged murder. The soldier, anonymised before the court as Person 66, briefly began giving evidence late on Monday, subpoenaed to give evidence by the newspapers defending a defamation action brought by his former comrade and Victoria Cross recipient Roberts-Smith. Three newspapers alleged in their defence that the soldier was ordered by Roberts-Smith to execute an unarmed prisoner in the village of Syahchow, in Uruzgan province, in October 2012. Roberts-Smith alleges their media reports portrayed him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. Much of Tuesday is expected to be given over to legal argument about whether Person 66 will be compelled to answer questions about the SAS mission. The newspapers allege in their defence that on the Syahchow mission Person 66 was “blooded” on the orders of Roberts-Smith, after they removed two unarmed prisoners from a compound where the men had been detained and took them to a nearby field. Roberts-Smith allegedly ordered Person 66 to shoot one of the men. He allegedly complied with the order. Roberts-Smith has denied the Syahchow allegation. Asked directly during his evidence last year if he had ordered Person 66 to execute a prisoner, Roberts-Smith said: “I did not.” In the witness box late on Monday, Person 66 told the court he was temporarily attached to the SAS patrol commanded by Roberts-Smith in 2012. But he refused to answer questions about missions conducted under Roberts-Smith’s command, telling the court he objected on the grounds of self-incrimination. Person 66’s barrister, Jack Tracey, directed Justice Anthony Besanko to an outline of evidence served by the newspapers that detailed the evidence they expected Person 66 to give. “If that evidence were given as … set out in that outline, then it would have the tendency to incriminate the witness,” Tracey told the court. “The offence … would be an offence of murder.”. Nick Owens SC, acting for the newspapers, also told the court he didn’t dispute Person 66’s lawyers claims that “if evidence is given in accordance with the outline, that that would be evidence which would tend to expose the witness to criminal liability for the crime of murder”. Besanko said there were reasonable grounds for the objection, and told the witness that the court could grant a certificate under section 128 of the Evidence Act preventing his evidence being used against him in Australian courts. Person 66 said he was still not willing to give the evidence, requiring the court to consider whether it should require him to do so. Owens told the court it was alleged Person 66 only went on one mission with Roberts-Smith as his patrol commander. The court earlier heard evidence from the assistant defence minister, Andrew Hastie, who was a captain in the SAS in 2012 and also on the mission to Syahchow. Under cross-examination on Monday, Hastie was asked what he believed had happened at Syahchow. “It’s my view that Person 66 was blooded,” he said. The practice of “blooding” allegedly involves a new soldier being initiated into the regiment by being ordered to register their first “kill” on operation – allegedly often of an unarmed prisoner. Hastie said that while he did not witness any prisoners being killed, he was disquieted by what had happened at Syahchow, based on a “mosaic” of observations on the ground and information from other soldiers. Before deploying in command of an SAS troop the next year, Hastie told the court briefed his subordinates on the need to obey the laws of war. “I believed something unlawful had happened at Syahchow in the weeks after, which is why I reinforced with my own troop standards [of adherence to rules of engagement],” he said on Monday. Hastie said in evidence on Friday he remembered Roberts-Smith’s patrol using an interpreter to “tactically question” a number of Afghans up against a wall. He told the court that after moving to a different part of the compound, he heard the words “shots fired” and “two Ekia” – enemy killed in action – over the troops’ radio, but that he didn’t hear any shots. He said he later saw Person 66 in the compound at Syahchow “standing slightly off from the rest of the patrol looking nervous”. He testified he also saw Roberts-Smith again on the mission. “Mr Roberts-Smith walked past me … and he looked me in the eye and said ‘Just a couple more dead cunts’,” Hastie said. Under forensic cross-examination, Hastie denied having “made up” his evidence, or that his memories of the mission were false. Hastie also denied he had been critical of Roberts-Smith to raise his own profile as a parliamentarian or that he had briefed journalists in the hope of receiving positive political coverage. Tuesday’s hearing is likely to be largely dedicated to legal argument over Person 66’s objection to answering questions and whether he will be compelled to answer those questions.",News/Australia news,Ben Roberts-Smith defamation trial: former soldier objects to answering questions about SAS missions ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/ben-roberts-smith-defamation-trial-former-soldier-objects-to-answering-questions-about-sas-missions
3/29/2022,"This brash new show (Sky Atlantic) sets out its stall right away, announcing that it will be “a dramatisation of certain facts and events”, while making it clear that it is allowing plenty of wiggle room for interpretation. Those certain facts and events involve the rise and rise, in the 1980s, of the LA Lakers and its star players, who came to define not just basketball but an entire cultural epoch. It is big and showy, though its garish style is not yet matched by the substance it needs to balance out its exhibitionistic streak. Even the most sport-averse viewers should be familiar with the superstar appeal of Earvin “Magic” Johnson, played here with ample charm by newcomer Quincy Isaiah. The first two episodes detail the NBA’s first ever taste of Johnson, and the purchase, in 1979, of the Lakers by the late Jerry Buss, who would go on to turn their fortunes around. Anyone expecting actual basketball may be left disappointed, as it’s very much a behind-the-scenes approach, detailing the gutsy financials and macho wheeling and dealing far more than the sport. It’s a workplace drama, though you might expect a bit more oomph from a workplace such as the LA Lakers. The pace is a mystery. It opens with what is, presumably, Johnson’s HIV diagnosis in 1991, but has not returned to that point yet. Many of its scenes are loose. Winning Time is executive produced by Don’t Look Up and The Big Short director Adam McKay, who also directs the pilot episode. His visual tics are all over this, from the breaking of the fourth wall to the quickfire breakdowns of financial deals, to the crash zooms and collage-like use of archive footage. A metaphor about swans swimming is intercut with rapid footage of their webbed feet paddling. The rivalry between Johnson and Larry Bird is depicted with various adverbs flashing up on the screen, which give way to the words “black” and “white”, repeated again and again. It is not subtle. I know plenty of people who love McKay’s style, though I find it self-conscious and often intrusive. The breaking of the fourth wall is so ubiquitous now that its use here inspired a recent Gawker article begging film-makers to stop it. The overtly stylised approach lends this a grandiose feel that should suit the subject matter. All of the big themes are here: life, death, love, sport, fame, and particularly money. It’s weird, then, that it feels sluggish. “Goddamn. Basketball. I mean, look at it,” says John C Reilly, having a ball as Buss, and I wondered whether looking at basketball might have helped usher it along. Still, there is plenty to recommend. It is clearly ambitious, and if it is taking its time over the mechanics of the early stuff, then I can only imagine that there is more in the way of excitement in store for the team, when and if the team begins to move into focus. The performances are excellent, particularly Isaiah as 19-year-old Johnson, all height and charisma and potential, and Reilly, whose enthusiasm for the new world he finds himself in is infectious. If Johnson is the man with the golden touch, then Buss is the man with the golden tongue, and watching him talk his way into and out of tricky situations is deeply enjoyable. Gaby Hoffmann, too, stands out as Claire Rothman, the general manager of the team’s Forum home, and a lone powerful voice in the boys’ club. In one early scene, Buss lounges on a circular waterbed, with a half-naked woman, the pair of them rustling in satin sheets. “If there’s two things in this world that makes me believe in God, it’s sex and basketball,” he says. Winning Time is a bit Boogie Nights, a bit Mad Men, filled with sexist, racist men. That’s of its time, and I don’t doubt that the reality was worse, but this doesn’t go much deeper than that. The few female characters drift in and out as ciphers of decency, rolling their eyes at the scallywags that are their bosses and boyfriends and fathers and ex-husbands. It is a touch superficial, then, but it is a lot of fun. The whole thing is given a VHS/old film veneer, and all that chest hair and bushy moustaches look the part. For a drama about greatness, though, it just doesn’t quite scale the heights.
