3/16/2022,"The punishing economic sanctions imposed by the West on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine has roiled global energy markets, with a U.S. ban on Russian oil imports further pushing up gas prices for Americans. Now, GOP leaders are blaming surging fuel costs in part on a decision by President Biden early in his administration to block the Keystone XL Pipeline. Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw, who has urged the Biden administration to ramp up domestic oil production, said in a tweet the day before Russia's February 24 attack that the Keystone project would have produced 830,000 barrels of crude per day. ""Stop importing from Russia, start producing more,"" he tweeted in early March. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem went a step further than Crenshaw, writing in a February 24 op-ed for Fox News that in halting the Keystone XL pipeline Mr. Biden was ""signaling to the world that American energy independence is no longer a priority."" ""Keystone would have helped ease those fears while giving America the flexibility to counter Russian aggression by expanding energy exports to Europe,"" she wrote. With Americans facing the worst inflation in 40 years, would expanding Keystone offer much relief at the pump? Root of the problem It's important to understand what's contributing to the high prices of oil in the first place. Gregory Nemet, professor of public affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Wisconsin Energy Institute, pointed out that the cost of oil has steadily increased since last fall, when it was around $70 a barrel, to more than $130 last week before settling back at around $100 a barrel on Tuesday. That initial jump in the cost of crude was driven by the ongoing economic recovery, which boosted demand by consumers and businesses that had been dampened by the COVID-19 pandemic. ""A lot more transportation and people flying around, people driving, more demand for oil,"" he said. ""And supply doesn't always quickly respond to that kind of shock in demand."" The war in Ukraine also plays a role, although it was not the instigator of the increase. ""Whenever there is political instability in places that produce a lot of oil, markets react,"" Nemet said. ""And it's not necessarily that they're saying, 'Oh there's not enough oil.' It's, 'Oh, there's a lot more risk now than there was before.'"" The U.S. imported an average of 209,000 barrels of crude oil per day from Russia in 2021, according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, as well as 500,000 barrels per day of other petroleum products. This amount makes up 3% of U.S. crude oil imports and about 1% of the crude oil processed in U.S. refineries. Keystone XL, an expansion of an existing North American pipeline, would have carried 830,000 barrels of crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska daily at its peak. At the time Mr. Biden halted its construction, the $8 billion expansion was only about 8% complete, according to Reuters. Yet many experts agree that moving ahead with the pipeline wouldn't have prevented U.S. gas prices from climbing to a record high. Expanding the Keystone would have increased global oil production by less than 1%, an amount, they explained, is ""almost negligible."" ""I can see why people make that connection,"" Nemet said.""But in terms of gasoline prices and global oil prices, it's just something it's better to just ignore because it would have no impact."" More production, but higher costs for Americans Even if the pipeline was already built, it wouldn't help with the price at the pump, Nemet added, noting that the U.S. has already doubled its oil production over the last 15 years. ""And yet, we still have $100 per barrel oil."" With inflation soaring, gas prices have been increasing for months — hitting an average of $4.33 a gallon on March 11, according to AAA. ""The key lesson there is the U.S. is not the whole story here. It's a global market,"" Nemet said. ""And so we've got 8 billion people that are consuming oil and many countries that are producing it, and it all goes into one market."" David Kieve, president of advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund Action, also told CBS News that building out the Keystone pipeline would not have softened the impact the Ukraine crisis is having on fuel prices. ""The Keystone pipeline, under the best of circumstances if you were a proponent of seeing it completed, wouldn't be completed yet,"" he said. ""It wouldn't be online and wouldn't be pumping oil until the year 2023. ... So the idea that somehow the president's position on the pipeline that would still not be pumping oil emboldened Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine is so far-fetched as to be incredible."" Even if the Biden administration were to immediately offer new oil leases to drillers, it wouldn't help with the costs Americans are bearing today. It would take six to 10 years for oil from a new lease to hit the global market, Kieve said. Less oil, clean energy fans say By contrast, Mr. Biden's decision with the International Energy Agency to release 30 million barrels of oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve puts downward pressure on gas prices in the short-term, Kieve said. The agency will release a total of 60 million barrels of crude to help ease some of the supply disruptions caused by the war Ukraine. ""You won't see a lot of environmental organizations jumping up and down and saying, 'Hey, this is the best thing ever,'"" Kieve said. ""But there is a recognition that those types of actions may have some impact on the prices that Americans are paying at the pump."" In the long run, the best way to protect Americans from spiking oil prices is to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy, Nemet and Kieve said. Unlike oil, renewable energy relies far less on fixed and limited natural resources. Energy from solar panels, wind turbines and other low-carbon technologies also tends to get cheaper the more widely it is used, they said. ""Instead of having international competition for a scarce resource where everybody wants the oil and there's a fixed amount of it, it's different,"" Nemet said. ""It's that as we produce more and more of these clean energy technologies...they get more affordable for everyone."" ""We're all mindful of the pain that Americans are feeling at the pump right now, but the best way to eliminate pain at the pump in the long run is to get rid of the pump altogether,"" Kieve said. ""Clean energy that we harvest here at home and work to figure out a better way to store is going to power us here at home.""",Business/CBS MoneyWatch•18 hours ago,Could the Keystone XL pipeline help lower U.S. gas prices?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-keystone-xl-pipeline-help-191233512.html
3/16/2022,"By Marc Jones LONDON (Reuters) - The economic cost of Russia's assault on Ukraine was further exposed on Wednesday as the sanctions-hit country teetered on the brink of its first default on international debt since the Bolshevik revolution. Moscow is due to pay $117 million in interest on two dollar-denominated sovereign bonds it sold in 2013. But the limits it now faces in making payments, and talk from the Kremlin that it might pay in roubles - triggering a default anyway - has left even veteran investors guessing at what might happen. One described it as the most closely watched government debt payment since Greece's default at the height of the euro zone crisis. Others said a grace period that allows Russia another 30 days to make the payment could drag the saga out. ""The thing about defaults is that they are never clear-cut and this is no exception,"" said Pictet emerging market portfolio manager Guido Chamorro. ""There is a grace period, so we are not really going to know whether this is a default or not until April 15,"" he said referring to the situation if no coupon payment is made. ""Anything could happen in the grace period."" By midday in London, creditors were still waiting to see if the funds would arrive. One bondholder, on condition of anonymity, said there had been no confirmation of a payment as yet and it was still not clear whether it would come. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov meanwhile said Moscow had made the payment which had reached the correspondent American bank, and it was now down to Washington to clarify whether settlement is possible. A default by the Russian government was unthinkable until what Russian President Vladimir Putin calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine began in late February. It had nearly $650 billion of gold and foreign currency reserves, investment-grade credit ratings with S&P Global, Moody's and Fitch, and was raking in hundreds of millions of dollars a day selling its oil and gas at soaring prices. Then the tanks rolled and the United States, Europe and their Western allies fired back with unprecedented sanctions that froze two-thirds of Russia's reserves which it turned out were held overseas. ""I think the market now expects Russia not to make the (bond) payments,"" said the head of emerging market debt at Aegon Asset Management, Jeff Grills, adding that the conflict was one of the few emerging market events capable of really unsettling global markets. That is because Russia's role as one of the world's top commodity producers has sent prices and global inflation skywards. At the same time it has left Russia a virtual pariah state, crippled by sanctions and watching hundreds of the world's largest firms quit the country after deciding their presence there is no longer feasible. Graphic: Russia international debt default looming: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zgvomznxovd/Pasted%20image%201646220845544.png DEFAULT SCENARIOS As for Russia's battered government bonds, most are now changing hands at just 10%-20% of their face value. The two payments on Wednesday are the first of several, with another $615 million due over the rest of March, and the first ""principal"" - final full payment of a bond - on April 4 worth $2 billion alone. Experienced investors see three potential scenarios for how Wednesday's crucial deadline plays out. The first is that Moscow pays in full and in dollars, meaning default worries go away for the time being. Big Russian energy providers Gazprom and Rosneft have both made payments on international bonds over the last 10 days so there is still a sliver of hope it could be done if Moscow feels it is in its interests. The second possibility is that Moscow doesn't pay, starting the 30-day grace period countdown clock until default. A third option where Russia pays but in roubles is also possible, although the legal terms of the bonds would mean that is still tantamount to a default. The 30-day grace rule would still apply. ""Maybe we will know today (if they pay) but maybe we won't,"" said Pictet's Chamorro. His firm doesn't hold the bonds, but does hold other Russian debt - and when a country defaults on one of its bonds it tends to mean all its bonds ""cross default"". ""In situations like these it's safest to expect the unexpected. You can't really rule anything out"".

3/16/2022,"Metals prices aren’t just breaking records … they’re disrupting entire exchanges. On Wednesday, three-month contract prices for nickel more than doubled in a matter of hours to over $100,000 per ton, causing the London Metal Exchange (LME) to suspend trading over what it called an “unprecedented” event. Base metals across the board have continued to rise. Copper prices hit an all-time high last week, and Zinc has consistently broken records this month. Aluminum prices on the LME have increased by another 5% on Wednesday alone, on fears of a Russian supply disruption. And gold has hit record highs of its own on the invasion of Ukraine’, not to mention high inflation. Some analysts even expect gold prices to triple over the next five years. Russia’s war on Ukraine is roiling the metals markets beyond recognition … That’s because Russia is a powerhouse supplier of so many of them, and now the rest of the world fears major supply chain disruptions. That could be the perfect setup for North American explorers … And one junior miner is looking to capitalize on the supply squeeze and rising prices for a number of those metals that have been disrupting exchanges right now. Starr Peak Mining Ltd. (TSX:STE.V; OTCQX:STRPF), which has made a number of extremely well-timed acquisitions over the past few years, set out to find gold but ended up discovering an entire basket of some of these same base metals that are shocking the commodities exchanges into suspensions. Overnight, Starr Peak has gone from being an exciting gold and base metal exploration play to being something even bigger: A potentially critical element in the future of North America’s supply chain security. A Maiden Drill That Plays To Surging Metals Markets? After scooping up prime gold acreage next to a discovery by Amex Exploration that at one point rewarded early investors with up to 7,000% returns, Starr Peak was hoping only to replicate Amex’s success, which may be exactly why an Amex executive jumped on with Starr Peak as an advisor. They were hoping for it, too. But then Starr Peak surprised many of us with much more than a gold discovery. On its maiden drill program at its NewMétal property in Quebec’s Abitibi Greenstone Belt, Starr Peak reported back with indications of a VMS (volcanogenic massive sulphide) discovery containing multiple base metals, including zinc, copper, silver, and gold. A VMS deposit can help turn a junior gold miner into a company worth multiple times its market valuation because they’re rare finds that are found in clusters of deposits, and they boast longer-term production potential. Now, with base metals prices soaring on a war-time footing and supply chain security becoming an issue of desperation, a VMS discovery would not just be timely–it would be critical. In the second round of results on January 11th, Starr Peak reported its best VMS intercepts yet, of 8.98% zinc equivalent over 9.85 meters and 1.28% copper over 7.20 meters. Upper Zone (above 400 meters, vertically): STE-21-73: 5.90 m of 6.04% Zinc Equivalent Deep Zone (below 400 meters, vertically): STE-21-82-W1: 9.85 m of 8.98% Zinc Equivalent, including 0.82% of copper Deep Zone (below 400 meters, vertically): STE-21-81: 7.20 m of 5.14% Zinc Equivalent, including 1.28% of copper Drilling is ongoing, and Starr Peak secured a third rig in February for NewMétal, focusing on the priority VTEM anomalies on a projected extension of the Perron Eastern Gold Zone trend. An Almost 100% Hit Rate So Far Starr Peak (TSX:STE.V; OTCQX:STRPF) had almost a 100% hit rate on its reported drill hole targets, and each drill has led to further expansion of the drill program that started in May 2021. We think this year could be even bigger, targeting the 4-kilometer prolific Normetmar-Normetal lithological contact on Starr Peak’s property and with NewMétal also set to be drill-tested. And all of this is in one of Canada’s most prolific gold and polymetallic venues–the Abitibi Greenstone Belt. They’re also well-funded to keep drilling, with seven private placement deals raising approximately $15 million since 2020. With supply chain disruptions now likely assured, even for minerals that Russia isn’t a major supplier, it’s the perfect time to be announcing solid results in a play that indicates a basketful of ultra-high-demand metals. If Starr Peak can prove up a commercial VMS deposit, we think it could become the junior mining discovery of the decade, right at a time when the market is in “panic mode in terms of supply”, as T-Commodity’s Gianclaudio Torlizzi tells Mining.com. As giant automakers look to establish battery supply chains amid a brutal Russian war in Ukraine that has major sanctions backlash, Starr Peak could be one of our best picks for playing the base metals supply squeeze. Other companies looking to capitalize on the commodity boom: Newmont (NYSE:NEM, TSX:NGT) is a mining company with a global footprint. It has operations in the United States, Australia, Peru and Ghana. They are one of the world's largest gold producers and they have been operating for over 100 years. Newmont has its headquarters in Greenwood Village, Colorado (a suburb of Denver) where it was founded in 1921 by William Boyce Thompson. Following its acquisition of Goldcorp, Newmont became the single biggest gold company in the world, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t still have some room to run. As far as management goes Newmont doesn't have any weak spots. Its board includes veteran mining executives like Bob McAdam of Barrick Gold Corp., Tom Albanese of Rio Tinto plc (NYSE:RIO), Joe Jimenez of Dow Chemical Company (DOW) and John Wiebe of Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC). Like other miners, Newmont Corporation has had a great year. Since January, the company has seen its share price rise by 21%, and there are a growing number of catalysts that could push it even higher in the short-to-medium term. Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD, TSX:ABX) is a Canada-based mining, exploration and production company. It has operations in North America and South America with mines in North America (Nevada), Chile and Argentina. Barrick also operates an open-pit mine at Pascua Lama on the border of Chile and Argentina. The Company's growth strategy includes expanding its Carlin Trend gold deposit in Nevada through selective acquisitions of key properties to provide meaningful leverage to rising gold prices as well as increased exploration for new deposits. Year to date, Barrick Gold has already seen its share price increase by 27%, and it’s showing no signs of slowing. As geopolitical fissures continue to grow, and the Federal Reserve rushes to curb runaway inflation, solid gold miners like Barrick have drawn a lot of attention for investors, especially considering the healthy 0.96% dividend per share that comes with the purchase.Yamana Gold (NYSE:AUY, TSX:YRI) is another one of the world’s top gold and precious metals miners. The company has been producing gold for over 50 years and operates two mines: the Canadian Malartic mine in Canada and the Minera Florida mine in Chile. It also owns three other properties: Agua Rica, Tapada do Norte, and Caiena. One of Yamana's most notable mines is the Chapada mine in Brazil which has been operational since 2011. In 2021, Yamana signed a deal with industry giants Glencore and Goldcorp to develop and operate another Argentinian project, the Agua Rica. Initial analysis suggests the potential for a mine life in excess of 25 years at average annual production of approximately 236,000 tonnes (520 million pounds) of copper-equivalent metal, including the contributions of gold, molybdenum, and silver, for the first 10 years of operation. In February alone, shares of Yamana Gold jumped by 20% on its solid financials and growing geopolitical and economic instability. And now, as investors pile into safe haven resources, miners with strong financials and ambitious plans to expand, like Yamana Gold, have some major upside potential in the coming months. Kirkland Lake Gold (NYSE:KL, TSX:KL) is yet another Canadian gold miner. Kirkland has been in operation for over half a century. They are one of the world's largest producers of gold, with their mines located throughout Canada. The company focuses on using sustainable practices to ensure they are leaving behind an environment that can be enjoyed by generations to come. While it doesn’t hold the same clout as Barrick or Newmont, Kirkland is no stranger to striking headline-grabbing deals in the industry. In fact, just recently, Kirkland and Newmont signed a $75 million exploration deal that could wind up being a game-changer for the industry. The two companies have agreed to split the cost 50/50 over five years with each company investing $15 million every year into joint projects between both companies for exploration purposes only. Kirkland has bucked the trend in gold miner returns this year, with its share price falling by 26% since January. That doesn’t mean it is still not a force to be reckoned with, however. Supply chain issues have proven to be a major thorn in Kirkland’s side, but that won’t last forever. Kirkland may still have a little bit further to fall, but it’s definitely worth keeping an eye on, because once it hits a bottom, it could see a strong run. Lithium Americas Corp. (NYSE:LAC, TSX:LAC) is one of North America’s most important and successful pure-play lithium companies. With two world-class lithium projects in Argentina and Nevada, Lithium Americas is well-positioned to ride the wave of growing lithium demand in the years to come. It’s already raised nearly a billion dollars in equity and debt, showing that investors have a ton of interest in the company’s ambitious plans, and it will likely continue its promising growth and expansion for years to come. It’s not ignoring the growing demand from investors for responsible and sustainable mining, either. In fact, one of its primary goals is to create a positive impact on society and the environment through its projects. This includes cleaner mining tech, strong workplace safety practices, a range of opportunities for employees, and strong relationships with local governments to ensure that not only are its employees being taken care of, but locals as well. While Lithium Americas has seen some volatility in recent months, the miner is up 60% since this time last year. And it’s easy to see why. If lithium truly is the new oil, Lithium Americas may well be one of the supermajors of the industry. Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) is a Chilean company that produces more than 55 minerals, including lithium, iodine, potassium nitrate and copper. The company's headquarters are located on Avenida Kennedy, Santiago which was once an industrial area of the city with as many of 300 factories built there during its heyday between 1880 to 1930s. Sociedad Química y Minera sees the lithium industry growing at around 20 percent per year in the long term, supported by rising EV sales and emission reduction goals from China to the United States. And as one of the largest lithium miners in the Western hemisphere, SQM is well positioned to take advantage of the boom. Year-to-date, Sociedad Quimica y Minera has fared a bit better than one of its biggest competitors, Lithium Americas. Since January, SQM has seen its share price rise by 38%, and if it continues to post solid financials, it could climb even higher. Analysts are already raising their estimates for SQM, and this year’s just getting started. By. Tom Kool **IMPORTANT! BY READING OUR CONTENT YOU EXPLICITLY AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING.

3/16/2022,"The markets were already on shaky ground at the onset of 2022, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has ramped upped the volume significantly. Apart from specific segments that could benefit from the ongoing invasion -- defense and energy stocks with little exposure to Russia readily come to mind -- most segments are in risk-off mode, while the market is spooked by soaring commodity prices, with the added danger of US inflation hitting its highest level in 40 years not making the macro conditions any easier to forecast. So, everyone is psychologically prepared for another leg down. That said, if technical indicators are anything to go by, Oppenheimer’s Head of Technical Analysis Ari Wald thinks a relief rally could be in the cards. “The NASDAQ-100 is trading 11% below its 200-day average. Over the last 30 years, the index only traded with a significantly lower deviation in 2000 and 2008,” Wald explained. “However, in both cases, a countertrend rally developed from similar conditions as now. The point is that, even if we assume the worst, we think tactical conditions are currently more favorable than not.” Against this backdrop, the analysts at Oppenheimer have pinpointed two stocks which they see as yielding at least 40% returns over the coming months. We ran the tickers through the TipRanks database to get a fuller picture of their prospects. Turns out both are rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus with solid gains projected too. Here are the details. Viridian Therapeutics (VRDN) Let’s start off with Viridian Therapeutics, a biotech company focused on the development of treatments for patients suffering from serious yet underserved diseases. Presently, the company’s pipeline is mostly based on treatments for TED (thyroid eye disease) patients, all in various stages of development. The most advanced candidate is VRDN-001, a monoclonal antibody that has a sub-nanomolar affinity for the IGF-1R signaling pathway and inhibits it. The treatment is currently undergoing a Phase 1/2 clinical trial with topline proof of concept data slated for a readout in Q2. Should the trial yield positive results, the company plans to move quickly to investigate lower dosages and longer treatment intervals in new TED cohorts, with the goal of distinguishing vs. Horizon Therapeutics’ Tepezza, the sole product approved for TED. Further behind in development is VRDN-002, a next-generation IGF-1R antibody intended as a low-volume, subcutaneous (SC) injection, also for the treatment of TED. Late in January, the FDA gave its nod of approval for the investigational new drug (IND) for the candidate and Viridian has begun to enroll for the Phase 1 SAD (single ascending dose) trial. A data readout is anticipated midway through the year. Given that in only its second-year on the market Tepezza generated US sales of $1.7 billion, Oppenheimer’s Leland Gershell thinks signs are encouraging for Viridian’s offering. “Like Tepezza, VRDN's VRDN-001 is an intravenous IGF-1R antibody, and initial clinical data in TED are expected in 2Q22. With HZNP projecting $3B+ peak US sales for Tepezza, we see ample revenue potential for '001, and its higher potency may enable differentiation,” the analyst said. “We expect that progress in the development of VRDN's TED candidates will support outperformance.” Accordingly, Gershell rates VRDN stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) while his $170 price target provides room for 88% growth in the year ahead. (To watch Gershell’s track record, click here) Gershell’s colleagues unequivocally agree. Based on Buys only - 4, in total - the stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target stands at $32.50, and should it be met, investors will be pocketing gains of ~61%. (See Viridian stock forecast on TipRanks) Sierra Oncology (SRRA) The next stock we’ll look at also operates in the pharma industry. As Sierra Oncology’s name implies, the company is focused on finding therapies for cancer, of the rare kind. Sierra has several candidates in its pipeline, mostly in the early stages of development, but its leading candidate momelotinib (MMB) completed a Phase 3 study (MOMENTUM) last December. The drug has been indicated to treat myelofibrosis (MF) patients who had prior treatment with an approved JAK inhibitor. The company announced topline results at the end of January, which were excellent with the trial achieving the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints. Sierra plans on submitting with the FDA an NDA (new drug application) in the second quarter, when it will also ask for a priority review. Following the release of the positive top-line results, the company boosted its financial position in 1Q via a public offering and debt financing, building on the $104.7 million of cash and cash equivalents it held as of the end of 2021. Oppenheimer’s Jay Olson believes an approval is “likely to happen in 1H23,” and thinks the cash boosting move “should provide additional flexibility” to execute the launch of momelotinib next year. Additionally, the company intends to kick off a Phase 2 study of SRA515 - a selective BRD4 BET inhibitor - in combination with MMB in 1H22, also for the treatment of MF. The analyst has high hopes for the drug. He writes, “We consider MMB's safety profile and ability to address underserved MF patients attractive, supported by a recent publication (in the Journal of Hematology & Oncology). As the MF treatment landscape continues to evolve into combination therapy, momelotinib also bodes well as a potential backbone JAKi agent in combination regimens in the front-line setting… We believe that momelotinib is well positioned to secure 2L treatment, given its unique chemical structure, prior Ph3 clinical trials, and the published literature.” Based on all of the above, Olson gives SRRA an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, while his $45 price target suggests shares will climb 42% higher over the coming year. (To watch Olson’s track record, click here) Overall, there are only 3 analyst reviews on record for this name, but they are all positive, providing the stock with a Strong Buy consensus rating. SRRA has an average price target of $48.67, implying ~54% upside from the $31.54 trading price.
