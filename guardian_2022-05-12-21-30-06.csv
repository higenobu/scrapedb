5/12/2022,"Art by celebrities is often risible. But there is nothing unintentionally funny about the technically excellent paintings of Jim Moir, AKA Vic Reeves. Nor is he playing it for laughs. There are no jokes here, just precise, intense portrayals of birds. Moir, a keen birdwatcher, has clearly spent a lot of time looking at nature, even longer finessing his style. His studies of wrens, finches, water birds, a red kite, a nightingale and more are finely observed, lovingly detailed works of ornithology. The studied objectivity of these avian portraits – nicely capturing the crinkly skin and claws of feet that grasp branches, the softness and structure of feathers and bright hues against the sky – brings back to life the Victorian tradition of meticulous animal art. Yet as you settle into this quiet art, sucked into the mentality of Moir’s hobby as a birder, surrealism starts to sneak in after all. Blue Tit & Vim – imagine the title being read by Reeves – depicts a little bird perched on top of an empty bleach container. It suddenly tears us from pure nature into an unsightly glimpse of everyday pollution. Yet it’s funny, and it’s pop art, as if the great American bird artist John James Audubon was cross-bred with early Warhol. It’s also a neat embodiment of the classic definition of a surrealist image as “the chance encounter of a sewing machine and an umbrella on an operating table”. Birds are the favourite creatures of surrealism. From Edgar Allan Poe’s poem The Raven, to Max Ernst’s identification with the bird-headed shaman Loplop and his painting Two Children Are Threatened by a Nightingale, to Alfred Hitchcock’s surrealistic horror The Birds, these chirpy denizens of the skies have haunted modern art’s dreams. And the more time you spend in Moir’s show, the more uncanny his birds become. The eyes fix on you. Four portraits of owls glare right back from large flat faces, their glassy, reflective depths brilliantly caught in very convincing watercolour work. You can see the world mirrored in them. What are the owls thinking? An oil painting of a snowy owl is even more intense, its stare taken one step from reality into a dream world of hot colours where it floats mystically. After being freaked out by the owls, you see eyes everywhere. The exhibition, it becomes evident, is not so much about us looking at birds, as birds looking at us. Behind the veil of his humour, it turns out Moir is not only a romantic but a radical. Intimations of avian consciousness chirrup from his pictures. Downstairs, in a cluttered office where some of his works are more atmospherically displayed (they really would be great in the gothic setting of the Natural History Museum, rather than a white walled gallery) is his painting of a rhino whose horn has changed into an arm that gives humanity the finger. Moir’s oil paintings are (so far) less authoritative than his watercolours. They’re a bit brash. But this is the exhibition of an artist who is still developing: it’s a brave, modest demonstration of his ongoing self-education. This is why drawing and painting are so beautiful. Whoever you are and whatever your age, you can develop the skills and sensibility to paint from life. Moir, at 63, sets an example. Beyond the skill, it is the love of nature that glows. You end up feeling stared at by birds who can see all our destructiveness. Reproached for that Vim can. See Them Richards?

5/12/2022,"Rutger Hauer, in his sixth and last film for Verhoeven, plays the leader of a band of mercenaries who kidnap and deflower the fiancee of a duplicitous nobleman, in this Dutch-American mini epic set in Italy during the middle ages. Brace yourself for non-PC sex and violence, Carry on up the Codpiece humour, and buboes a-go-go. Soldier of Orange may be the best film from Verhoeven’s early Dutch period, but The Fourth Man is the most fun. Jeroen Krabbé plays a gay alcoholic writer who has visions of castration, oozing eyeballs and crucifixion as he embarks on an affair with a female hairdresser who may have murdered her first three husbands. Glorious tosh, deliberately stuffed with over-the-top symbolism to wind up the critics who had panned the director’s previous film. Carice van Houten, later to achieve TV superstardom as Game of Thrones’ Melisandre, plays a Jewish chanteuse enlisted by the Dutch resistance to seduce a Nazi officer, a mission requiring her to dye her pubic hair and expose her breasts, frequently. In typical Verhoeven fashion, behind the outrageousness lurks a sly and sometimes discomfiting subversion of second world war cliches. Isabelle Huppert is sensational as a Parisian businesswoman who doesn’t behave the way you might expect after being raped on the floor of her dining room by a masked intruder. But, then, Verhoeven’s rape-revenge-comedy-thriller, neither particularly comic nor especially thrilling, consistently defies expectations in its nuanced exploration of trauma, blurred lines and the limits of control. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a construction worker whose fake memory implant from a virtual holiday agency results in scrambled brain cells, everyone trying to kill him, and a mission to Mars. Verhoeven rewrites the rules of sci-fi action with an orgy of exploding heads, multi-breasted mutants, Arnie extracting a golfball-sized tracker from his nostril, and cunning mindgames courtesy of the Philip K Dick source material. Verhoeven’s adaptation of Judith C Brown’s nonfiction book Immodest Acts: The Life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy reels audiences in with the promise of nunsploitation and a Virgin Mary dildo before broadsiding them with conflicts of faith, religious power politics and women’s place in society. Also, buboes and altar snakes. Never a dull moment. Verhoeven’s tits and bums variation on All About Eve, once dismissed as a turkey, has acquired a deservedly loyal following for its hilarious swimming pool sex, herky-jerky dance choreography, chimpanzee in the dressing room, and nervously brilliant dialogue. “I like tits,” declares a topless Las Vegas showgirl, to which our ambitious lapdancing heroine ripostes: “I like having nice tits.” A masterpiece of its type. The erotic thriller subgenre hits peak preposterousness with Michael Douglas as a San Francisco cop in sexual thrall to his chief murder suspect, Sharon Stone, playing a bestselling novelist with PhDs in literature, psychology andknickerless exhibitionism. Verhoeven turns the Hitchcockian thriller on its head, while Stone transforms the screenplay’s sleazy macho posturing into a transgressive display of fem-dom firepower. Peter Weller plays Murphy, a murdered Detroit police officer who is resurrected as “part man, part machine, all cop”. Verhoeven made his Hollywood debut with this sci-fi fable garnished with religious allegory, splattery violence and satirical digs at American culture. The idea of a privatised police force using unstable AI to prop up corporate interests now seems horribly prescient. “I’ll buy that for a dollar!” Fascist teens battle extraterrestrial arachnids in this viciously satirical adaptation of Robert A Heinlein’s sci-fi yarn set in a totalitarian all-American future. High-school graduates undergo gruelling military training before half of them get dismembered by giant bugs. Gruesome, subversive fun that alternates genocidal propaganda (“Would you like to know more?”) with purposefully anachronistic second world war-style combat. A work of genius.",Arts/Film,Paul Verhoeven’s 10 best films – ranked!,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/12/paul-verhoevens-10-best-films-ranked
5/12/2022,"Dina Asher-Smith has urged UK Athletics to keep a London base for the good of the sport amid reports that it is in preliminary talks over a £10-15m deal to quit the Olympic Stadium. Such a move would allow West Ham to transform their stadium into a full-time football ground but would raise serious questions about the 2012 Olympic legacy and the ability of UKA to stage major athletics meetings in the capital. And when Asher-Smith was asked whether Birmingham – which will host the Commonwealth Games this summer – could be the new home of British athletics, the 200m world champion made an impassioned plea to UKA not to forget London. “We’ve got a really nice new stadium in Birmingham, which I’ll be fortunate enough to try out next week,” she said. “I’m very excited for that and very excited about the Commonwealth Games. But I always think that London is the centre of sport in the UK.” “It would be amazing to have a base and really use the London Stadium, particularly as it is the Olympic Stadium and it is where the Anniversary Games has been,” she added. “All the other major sports have their base in London.” In 2013 a 50-year deal was signed for athletics to take place in a one-month slot every year amid West Ham’s lease of the stadium. However it costs £3m to convert to stage athletics and UKA, which is facing a financial squeeze, could decide to accept between £10-15m to give up its lease. Asher-Smith, who takes on the Olympic 400m champion, Shaunae Miller-Uibo, in a stacked Diamond League field in Dohaon Friday, also insisted she was fit and cautiously optimistic about a fast time before her first big race of the season. “I’m hoping to go out there and perform really well,” she added. “I think that’s the wisest thing to do early in the season. Last year the season-opener was Gateshead in the pouring rain. If you have expectations of times sometimes early on, you are not always fulfilled for reasons that are outside of your control.”",Sport/Sport,Asher-Smith urges UKA to stick with London amid Olympic Stadium exit reports,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/12/asher-smith-urges-uka-to-stick-with-london-amid-olympic-stadium-exit-reports
5/12/2022,"By the end of the night at the Stadio Olimpico, we had seen it all: six goals, two penalties, a red card given and another that probably should. A cup final edition of the Derby d’Italia, played out over 120 messy but captivating minutes and followed up with immediate breaking news. Giorgio Chiellini, Juventus’s captain, announced he was leaving the club. Ivan Perisic, the match-winner for Internazionale, suggested he could soon be moving on too. The stakes had been clear before kick-off. For Juventus this was a last chance to salvage a disappointing season. The rehiring of Massimiliano Allegri as manager last summer was supposed to represent a return to the club’s core ethos, the famous Giampiero Boniperti line that “winning isn’t important, it’s the only thing that counts”. Instead they were in danger of finishing without any trophies for the first time in 11 years. Inter have had a more positive campaign, but still the sense of progress under Simone Inzaghi felt precarious. They had beaten Juventus to win the Supercoppa in January but let leadership of Serie A slip through their fingers, provoking unfavourable comparison with the side that ground their way ruthlessly to the Scudetto under Antonio Conte last season. Inzaghi stood accused of allowing his team to slide back into their previous identity as “Pazza Inter” – Crazy Inter – a reference to a line in the club’s anthem. Conte had made it his mission to end those days, saying his team would be “regular and strong”. Whether the comparison is even fair is open for debate. Conte had Romelu Lukaku and Achraf Hakimi as pillars of his Inter side, both of whom followed him out the exit door. It is also true that Inter can still win this season’s title, sitting two points behind Milan with two games to play. Before Inzaghi, furthermore, this team went a decade without playing a Champions League knockout game, and 11 years without a Coppa Italia final. Still, the possibility of finishing this season with only the Supercoppa could not have appealed to him. Inter’s best football this season has been a class apart from most of Serie A and certainly easier on the eye than anything Juventus have produced lately. For a moment on Wednesday night, it looked as though Inter might win at a canter. Nicolò Barella opened the scoring in the seventh minute, scything in from the left and bending a shot around Mattia Perin from the edge of the box. Inter were dominant, first to claim the ball and eager to keep it moving once they had it. Juventus, as too often, were plodding. But the game turned on an injury and a goalkeeping calamity. Danilo, who started on the right of defence for Juventus, strained a muscle and was replaced in the 41st minute by a forward, Álvaro Morata. The Spaniard had a hand in his team’s equaliser just after half-time, jabbing his boot at a shot from Alex Sandro as it went past him on the edge of the six-yard box. It was not clear how much contact Morata made, if any, but his gesture was enough to deceive Samir Handanovic. The Inter keeper was in the right position to make a straightforward save at his near post but allowed the ball to deflect in off his thigh. Within two minutes, Juventus took the lead, Dusan Vlahovic forcing the ball in after Handanovic blocked his initial attempt at the end of a counter. Inter’s players had been caught too high up the pitch at a corner. With another referee they might have imploded. Marcelo Brozovic picked the ball up and booted it away in response to being booked for a foul on Paulo Dybala. The referee, Paolo Valeri, chose to be lenient. Then, in the 78th minute, he awarded Inter a contentious penalty. Leonardo Bonucci certainly made contact with Lautaro Martínez as the striker sought to tame a knockdown inside the box, placing a hand on his shoulder and pressuring him from behind. Matthijs de Ligt was also close by, and it was hard to see whether he clipped Lautaro’s standing leg. What did seem clear, on the slow-motion replays, was that Lautaro had hooked his other leg through Bonucci’s as he fell, making it look as though he had been impeded in a more dramatic way. The VAR booth did not see a clear-and-obvious error. Hakan Calhanoglu equalised with a brilliant penalty, aimed so far into the top right corner that it brushed the post on its way in. Juventus’s sense of injustice threatened to boil over. Allegri was shown a yellow card for excessive protests – and would later see red – but his substitutions had played a part in ceding the initiative at 2-1, Bonucci and Manuel Locatelli replacing Denis Zakaria and Federico Bernardeschi as his team retreated into a 5-4-1. Once they had surrendered their lead Juventus struggled to adapt to a different type of game. Inter won another penalty at the start of extra-time, when De Ligt brought down Stefan De Vrij. Calhanoglu had been withdrawn in the meantime, but Perisic converted with similar aplomb. The Croatian completed the scoring three minutes later, showing the range of his talent with a beautiful strike off his other boot. He has been Inter’s standout performer through the last part of this season, and supporters were encouraged before kick-off to hear the chief executive, Beppe Marotta, say that the club were ready to sign him to a new deal beyond the one that expires next month. Perisic gave a very different answer within seconds of the final whistle. “This is not how you talk to important players,” he said when asked about the negotiations on the domestic TV broadcast for Canale 5. “You don’t leave it to the last moment.” He ended the interview abruptly, leaving that answer hanging in the air. It did not seem to put a dampener on his night, as he went to join teammates celebrating under the Curva, but the loss of a player who has contributed four goals and four assists in the past five weeks alone will not be easy to swallow. Still, it is always easier to find the bright side with a winners’ medal around your neck. A few minutes later, it was Chiellini’s turn to face the cameras. “I’m not used to this,” he confessed, when his interviewer asked how it felt to finish the season empty-handed. The defender has won 20 trophies in his 17 years with the Bianconeri, though he and his teammates from the 2005-06 team docked a Scudetto as a result of the Calciopoli scandal would put the count at 21. Chiellini confirmed that this would be his last season playing at Juventus, but said he is still undecided on whether to retire or seek one last adventure on the pitch. “It’s my choice 100%,” he said. “Now the baton passes to others. I stayed on the pitch and battled for as long as I could, but I don’t like the idea of not being able to play matches to a high level.” A cup final against Juventus’s great rivals was a worthy stage on which to bid farewell. But doing it while Inter’s players danced and took turns to lead supporters’ chants through a megaphone was probably not how he imagined the scene.",Sport/Football,Change in the air as Inter leave Juve empty-handed in spiky cup final | Nicky Bandini,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/12/change-in-the-air-as-inter-leave-juve-empty-handed-in-spiky-coppa-italia-final
5/12/2022,"The chair of the UK Covid-19 public inquiry has urged the prime minister to significantly widen its scope to better examine the pandemic’s unequal impact on ethnic minority people, children and the UK’s mental health. Heather Hallett asked Boris Johnson to beef up the inquiry after receiving more than 20,000 responses to a public consultation on the government’s draft terms of reference, which many civic groups complained were too narrow. If the PM ratifies the redrawn terms, it would considerably extend a statutory inquiry that some experts predict is on course to be the largest in modern British history. The government’s draft terms already included 26 topics, including preparedness, lockdowns, testing, borders, infection control in hospitals and care homes, PPE, vaccines, furlough and sick pay. The inquiry has appointed 12 QCs to lead a mammoth effort that involves combing through what could be several million documents. Lady Hallett acted after campaigners complained the inquiry was set to be “bizarrely silent” on the impact on people’s mental health, and former children’s commissioners said that the draft terms’ single-line reference to “restrictions on attendance at places of education” would “brush the burden shouldered by children under the carpet”. Black, Asian and minority ethnic leaders had argued that the planned inquiry failed sufficiently to account for inequalities “as a result of systematic racism throughout the pandemic”. Downing Street’s draft terms said it would “consider any disparities evident in the impact of the pandemic and the state’s response, including those relating to protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 and equality categories under the Northern Ireland Act 1998”. But campaigners wanted specific reference to minority groups and assessment of the impact on human rights. Last week, the leaders of the Race Equality Foundation and the Caribbean & African Health Network, among other ethnic minority groups, called for the inquiry to consider “the experience of racism that increased the risks faced by black, Asian and minority ethnic communities during the pandemic as a specific programme of work”. Bangladeshi men were more than three times as likely to die with Covid than white British men, while Pakistani women were more than twice as vulnerable as their white British counterparts, ONS data showed. Hallett said she wanted consideration of the unequal impact of the pandemic to run through all sections of the inquiry, with possible focuses on ethnicity, religion, disability, elderly people, children in care and people living in poverty. Other topics the chair wants to see added are: the role of primary care, including the NHS 111 hotline, which many people used for advice on how to respond to Covid; the impact on places of worship; support for victims of domestic abuse; and access to bereavement support. Studies of people bereaved during Covid found that difficulties accessing bereavement support from GPs and bereavement services were common. After months of criticism that the government was too slow to initiate the inquiry, Johnson promised to start this spring, which is still technically possible. Once he agrees the terms, the inquiry will be formally established and can start gathering evidence and witness statements, even if the first cross-examinations will not happen before 2023. Hallett has already told government departments to protect evidence from destruction. Hallett is a former appeal court judge who was recently coroner for the inquests of the 56 people who died in the 7 July 2005 London bombings.",News/UK news,Chair of UK Covid inquiry urges Johnson to broaden its scope,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/12/chair-of-uk-covid-inquiry-urges-johnson-to-broaden-its-scope
5/12/2022,"The chairman of NatWest bank has argued that changes to the benefits system would be the most effective way for the government to help the poorest families struggling to cope with the cost of living crisis, instead of cutting taxes that also give the wealthy a financial boost. Sir Howard Davies, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, said soaring energy bills and rampant inflation are disproportionately affecting the poorest fifth of households and they should be the focus of financial support measures. “The squeeze on living standards as a result of higher energy prices and higher food prices is really extraordinary,” he said. “If you look at what people would need to do on their discretionary spending in order to offset those increases it’s massive. The bottom 20% of the population, they would have to reduce their discretionary spending by 20% to stay even financially.” Davies said it is difficult to compare the scale of the cost of living crisis in a historical context because Covid lockdowns put the brakes on a lot of household spending, which meant£280bn more in savings were built up compared with pre-pandemic and that was providing a “cushion of liquidity”. He said those with savings are able to carry on their lifestyles – pointing to the boom in the holiday market – and that an across-the-board tax cut would be a “blunt and very costly” and would also benefit those that don’t need it. “I think what [the government] need to do is to look at the incidence of the problem and where the worst elements of the squeeze are taking place,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “The problem lies at the bottom end of the income distribution where those people don’t have savings for the most part and therefore they have no cushion to dip into. I would be focusing on the bottom 20% and seeing what can be done to help them through the benefit system… Tax cuts are difficult to target in quite the same way.” While the bosses of Tesco and John Lewis have called for a windfall tax on the soaring profits at big energy companies, and Boris Johnson refused to rule it out on Thursday, Davies wascautious. “If you can very clearly define what you mean by a windfall, so that people will see this as a genuine one-off that isn’t part of a longer-term tax burden on that set of companies then the arguments for it start to stack up,” he said. “Some of the past experiences of windfalls have simply raised the cost of capital for companies because people have said simply well we can’t be sure we won’t have our profits taxed away in the future. If you can genuinely isolate the circumstances and why these profits are made in this particular time then you have got a decent argument. I don’t know how to make that argument at this point.” Davies, who advocated for a rise in interest rates last summer, said it was “unfortunate” the Bank of England did not move earlier to try to put the brakes on inflation, which is forecast to hit a 40-year high by the end of the year. “The record of history shows that if you don’t get ahead of the game then you have to do more later,” he said, adding that he believed that interest rates will have to rise further. “To some extent their anti-inflation work will be done for them. The higher energy prices in the end will squeeze other spending.”",News/Business,NatWest chair says best way to help poorest is through benefits,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/12/natwest-chair-help-poorest-benefits-tax-howard-davies
5/12/2022,"Tether, the largest “stablecoin” and a foundational part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, is at risk of a bank run after breaking its peg to the dollar amid the sector’s worst crash in years. The cryptocurrency traded at less than $0.98 (82p) for the first time in two years on Thursday morning, prompting its chief technology officer, Paolo Ardoino, to tweet reassurances to investors that it was still capable of honouring withdrawals at par. Like all stablecoins, tether is intended to only ever trade at a fixed value relative to a conventional currency: one tether token is always supposed to be $1. However, on Monday another prominent stablecoin, terra, broke its peg to the dollar and has slumped since, now trading at barely half its supposed stable value. That event appears to have precipitated a wider crash, with even the blue-chip cryptocurrencies plummeting over the past week. Bitcoin and ethereum are both down 30% in the past seven days, with smaller cryptocurrencies such as ripple, solana and dogecoin falling more than 40%. Binance, one of the largest US cryptocurrency exchanges, suspended deposits and withdrawals on Thursday from 11.30am for what it said was scheduled maintenance. The cryptocurrency jitters come amid a wider downturn in the US economy, with tech stocks sliding and US inflation at 8.3%. However, unlike previous downturns, where crypto has largely tracked wider weaknesses and recoveries, the near-total collapse of terra – valued at $30bn last week and now trading at less than $300m – has sparked real panic that the sector may face existential problems. A stablecoin, like the name suggests, is a type of cryptocurrency that is supposed to have a stable value, such as US$1 per token. How they achieve that varies: the largest, such as tether and USD Coin, are effectively banks. They hold large reserves in cash, liquid assets, and other investments, and simply use those reserves to maintain a stable price. Others, known as ""algorithmic stablecoins"", attempt to do the same thing but without any reserves. They have been criticised as effectively being backed by Ponzi schemes, since they require continuous inflows of cash to ensure they don't collapse. Stablecoins are an important part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. They provide a safer place for investors to store capital without going through the hassle of cashing out entirely, and allow assets to be denominated in conventional currency, rather than other extremely volatile tokens. There are particular concerns about tether because of its foundational role in the financial engineering of much of the sector and the fact it holds reserves in other cryptocurrencies, leading to fears of contagion if it collapses. Unlike terra – which maintains its value via a complex algorithm linked to the value of another cryptocurrency that has since collapsed – tether pledges that all its tokens “are backed 100%” by its reserves, which were $80bn in its last report in December and also include loans, precious metals, and investments in other crypto sector companies. Tether also pledges to exchange its tokens for US dollars directly, but only to any customer large enough to do so, with a minimum of $100,000 at a time while paying a 0.1% fee. In theory, tether should never trade below $1 as a result: any time it does, there is guaranteed profit from commercial arbitrageurs willing to buy the token at a discount and return it to tether for the full value. However, since terra’s collapse there has been such a rush of selling across the entire sector that the market value of tether fell as low as 95¢ before recovering. Public records show at least one large redemption removed almost $350m from the reserves. As redemptions increase, the company could be forced to call in its loans to other crypto companies, in turn causing them to suffer financially. And if it collapses entirely, large chunks of the industry simply stop working, as they rely on the tether token to keep prices stable relative to the US dollar. Another big player in the sector that is suffering is the crypto exchange Coinbase, with its stock trading down 60% over the last five days. It has been hit with the general slump in the tech sector, blowback from the crypto collapse and problems of its own. In its earnings report, the company reported a loss of $1.98 a share, compared with an expected profit of 17¢, and said its monthly transacting users had fallen 2.2m over the last quarter, and expected them to fall further. And the company also sparked panic among its users with a legally mandated disclosure that, if it goes bankrupt, customer deposits are not protected in the same way bank deposits are. “We should have updated our retail terms sooner, and we didn’t communicate proactively when this risk disclosure was added,” Coinbase’s chief executive, Brian Armstrong, tweeted. “My deepest apologies.”",News/Technology,Turmoil in crypto market as ‘stablecoin’ tether breaks dollar peg,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/12/stablecoin-tether-breaks-dollar-peg-cryptocurrencies
5/12/2022,"Andie MacDowell has said she had a panic attack prompted by the realisation she was the only woman on the set of a film she made in 2016. Speaking to Marie Claire, MacDowell said she “dropped to [her] knees” after the incident, which came in the aftermath of the election of Donald Trump to the US presidency. “I was really disturbed that nobody seemed to care about the vagina[-grabbing] comment,” she said. “I had gotten really sad. I went to do a job, a day’s work, and I had my very first panic attack. I was getting ready to shoot something, and I turn around and it’s, like, a roomful of men. Like, a sea of men. It flashed on something that was personal for me. And I dropped to my knees.” MacDowell said she retired to a fake bathroom on set to try to compose herself, looking at herself in the mirror and saying: “‘Get your shit together.’ It just freaked me out, not seeing any other women. It’s not that I have anything against men. I don’t! I just don’t like big groups of them. Since then, I’ve become very conscious of looking around and finding the women on set. For comfort.” MacDowell did not name the production she was working on when she had the panic attack. She shot three films that were released in 2017: Only the Brave, a Josh Brolin/Miles Teller elite firefighters film; Love After Love, about two grieving siblings; and Netflix yuletide comedy Christmas Inheritance. All three had primarily male crews. Speaking during the promotion of Love After Love, MacDowell talked about being surprised by the sight of herself, shooting her first nude scene, at the age of 59, in particular “how sad I looked. The only reason I could do that is because I know that sadness. That to me made me feel more vulnerable than being naked. It had no effect on me, being naked, which is fascinating.” Speaking to Marie Claire, MacDowell said she felt the advent of the #MeToo movement in 2017 had meant “you do see the difference on set. There are a lot more women.”",Arts/Film,‘A sea of men’: Andie MacDowell recalls having panic attack on all-male film set,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/12/a-sea-of-men-andie-macdowell-recalls-having-panic-attack-on-all-male-film-set
