3/31/2022,"The prime minister’s office has been ordered to search through Scott Morrison’s mobile phone for text messages with prominent QAnon conspiracy proponent Tim Stewart after a two-year freedom of information battle against Guardian Australia. In August 2019, Guardian Australia broke the news that Stewart – whose QAnon Twitter account, BurnedSpy34, was permanently suspended for “engaging in coordinated harmful activity” – was a family friend of Morrison, and his wife was on the prime minister’s staff. Stewart had claimed in messages on Signal to fellow QAnon supporters that he was passing on letters and information to the prime minister, Crikey and the ABC later reported. The Four Corners program raised questions as to why Morrison had used the term “ritual sexual abuse” in his apology to survivors of institutional child sexual abuse, revealing messages reportedly sent by Stewart referring to his attempts to get the words “ritual abuse” into the apology. The term had been prominent in QAnon circles. A spokesperson for the prime minister had previously said the term “ritual” is “one that the prime minister heard directly from the abuse survivors and the National Apology to Victims and Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse Reference Group he met with in the lead-up to the apology and refers not just to the ritualised way or patterns in which so many crimes were committed but also to the frequency and repetition of them.” In 2019, Stewart denied to Guardian Australia that he had sought to influence the prime minister on policy, and said that he had not communicated with him about the QAnon conspiracy. At the time the Four Corners program aired, Morrison said the program was “pretty ordinary” and he did not support the QAnon conspiracy theory. “I just think it’s sort of a bit ordinary to drag other people into, I mean, I’m the prime minister, hold me to account for my views,” he said at the time. “For people who have known me or have been friends with me over the period of time, they’re entitled to their privacy regardless of if people don’t agree with their views.” To verify some of the claims made, in October 2019 Guardian Australia filed a freedom of information request for documents held by the prime minister’s office, including text messages, related to Stewart. This was later narrowed down to just the text and WhatsApp messages between Stewart and Morrison between September and October 2019, when the story was first reported. In March 2020, the prime minister’s office refused the request, stating: “The prime minister is the head of the national government and your request presents a significant challenge to the day-to-day execution of his duties … the time that could be spent potentially processing your request would be a substantial and unreasonable diversion with the performance of the minister’s functions.” Two years after Guardian Australia appealed the decision to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, the acting commissioner, Elizabeth Hampton, has ruled the prime minister’s office must process the request on the basis that “a practical refusal reason does not exist”. The PMO sought to argue to the commissioner that it would take 50 hours to process the request, and erroneously claimed what was being sought was two years’ worth of text messages that could only be reviewed by a small number of staffers in the PM’s office, including his chief of staff. Guardian Australia had argued in submissions that ruling against the appeal would have set a precedent that would be used by ministers and prime ministers in the future that all text messages and other mobile communications were out of bounds of freedom of information requests due to the time it would take to search their devices. Hampton said while it was relevant to consider the prime minister has a busy schedule, she said she was not satisfied the estimated processing time was reasonable, given the PMO had mistakenly argued it was two years’ worth of text messages, and the prime minister’s office had not responded to a request for an itemised breakdown of the processing time. The overturning of the decision means the PMO must now process the request and search through the prime minister’s phone for the relevant messages, unless the ruling is appealed to the administrative appeals tribunal. The prime minister’s office has until 29 April to provide a decision on the request, regardless of the upcoming election and the government entering caretaker mode. Guardian Australia has asked PMO if an appeal will be sought. Freedom of information expert Peter Timmins said the upcoming election didn’t mean the prime minister’s office could stop processing the request, but said under FoI law, if there was a change in government, it’s unlikely the new government would have the records. “The caretaker period doesn’t stop the clock ticking. But if for example, we have a different prime minister there by the time this issue is moved ahead, it’s very unlikely that records of [that kind] will be passed to the new prime minister, which would mean that you’ve run into a dead end.” It comes as the Morrison government appointed a separate freedom of information commissioner, Leo Hardiman, and will hire nine additional staff to deal with the backlog in FoI reviews. In the last financial year, the OAIC received over 1,200 review requests, up 15% on the previous year, and 140% compared with 2015-16. As of the end of June 2021, there were 667 reviews that had been open for more than a year.",News/Australia news,"Scott Morrison must reveal any text messages from QAnon friend, information watchdog orders",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/31/scott-morrison-australian-pm-prime-minister-must-reveal-any-text-messages-from-qanon-friend-tim-stewart-burnedspy34-information-watchdog-orders
3/31/2022,"What would a progressive foreign policy for Australia look like today? Sadly, there is no identifiable progressive vision. Labor governments since the 1980s have usually promoted a combination of multilateralism and economic globalisation. Neither is viable now. Today, increasingly belligerent great powers undermine established international institutions. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means that rapprochement is unlikely soon. Globalisation is fracturing, hastened by the west’s sanctions on Russia. Closer to home, Australia’s relationship with its biggest trading partner, China, has never been worse, while the pandemic has exposed the dangers of long supply chains – a result of yesteryear’s economic liberalisation. In this fragmented and dangerous world, Labor has little different to offer. This is partly because Albanese and his senior colleagues are pursuing a “small target” campaign and offer few new ideas on most things. It also reflects Labor’s fear of appearing weak on national security – an anxiety on which the government is seeking to play with its crude attacks on China – even though the parties’ positions are nearly identical. Nonetheless, new progressive foreign policy ideas are absent globally. Labor is not alone. What would that mean in practice? For example, the recent leaked draft security agreement between Solomon Islands and China has put a spotlight on Australia’s relationship with Pacific island countries. If implemented, the agreement could potentially allow China to base ships in Solomon Islands, 2,000km from Australia. While its status is uncertain, Australia should work hard to prevent this agreement or similar from being signed with any Pacific country. It would profoundly transform and destabilise Pacific’s security order hence intensifying the pressure on Australia’s defence planning enormously. Nonetheless, Solomon Islands is a sovereign state and Australian policymakers would do well to ask themselves why its government would entertain this deal in the first place. Many Australian commentators have blamed Chinese “chequebook diplomacy”, casting Solomon Islands as the gullible party. Solomon Islanders, however, are not “dupes”. Pacific governments do not necessarily see the world like Australia. While Australia views China as a global bully, Pacific governments perceive Chinese engagement as giving them more leverage vis-a-vis Australia; the region’s hegemon. As the Pacific’s biggest aid donor, Australia has often taken a heavy-handed approach, trying to dictate to Pacific islanders how to run their governments and public institutions. Much of its aid also ended up in the pockets of Australian companies and consultants. Many in the region resent this. Chinese presence constrains Australian paternalism. It has also led Australia to pledge more money for infrastructure, which the Pacific sorely needs. Additionally, while Australia sees China as its biggest security threat, the Pacific associates that level of danger with climate change, not China. Australia’s dismal approach to climate change mitigation, and disapproval of Pacific climate activism, rankles. Granted, China is not itself a climate change paragon, but Australia’s claim to regional leadership has been harmed. A progressive-realist approach would recognise that China is in the region to stay, because Pacific governments want it there. Hence, leading in the Pacific does not mean kicking China out, as efforts to achieve this would probably backfire. Australia must take Pacific countries’ preferences and needs seriously. It needs to accommodate, even engage, China in areas that benefit the Pacific, and only compete where Australian security is clearly jeopardised, as with the aforementioned draft agreement. Australia could also empower Pacific sovereignty by supporting governments and civil society’s capacity to analyse debt sustainability and increase the transparency of Chinese-financed projects. Australia also should support Pacific countries’ capacity to shape regional policy agendas. To continue to use the Pacific Islands Forum to drive through Australia’s security and trade goals only heightens regional resentments. Short-termism should be replaced with a long-term commitment to partnership. In a new article in the Australian Journal of International Affairs, co-authored with four other colleagues, we argue that the key to this is a “progressive realism”. Our starting point is a pragmatic, “realist”, assessment of the main dynamics that shape modern international relations. Governments can only provide security, basic needs, and sustainable development by facing unflinchingly the realities of world politics. This means paying attention to changing distributions of power among states, but also to the contours of global value chains and the impacts of human-induced climate change, for example. This is followed by a progressive second step. Rather than accepting the world as it is, a progressive foreign policy should seek to redistribute existing power configurations. In recent years, progressive movements have focused more on issues of identity and inclusion and not enough on redistribution. This is a mistake. If progressive politics stands for anything, it is a more egalitarian distribution of wealth and life-chances. Placing a redistributive logic at the heart of order-building activities recognises that any global order premised on unequal, unjust distributions of wealth, power and status will be neither stable nor sustainable. Practice and ethics must, therefore, go together. Without first assessing do-ability, realising progressive goals is impossible. Combined, these two building blocks provide the foundations for a “progressive realism”; the basis for a left-of-centre foreign policy agenda. A second plank of a progressive realist foreign policy in the Pacific would involve a shift in Australia’s climate change stance. If Australia took climate action seriously, this alone would strengthen its leadership claims. This could be bolstered by allocating substantial financial resources to supporting climate adaptation, which should become the focus of Australia’s Pacific financing facility. This redistributive approach recognises the immediacy of the timelines that Pacific countries face in ensuring their own resilience, even survival, in a climate transformed future. Progressive realism provides the means for a long-term vision focused on maximising Australian influence over a range of strategic issues. We do not claim to have all the answers, but Australia must have an urgent debate over its foreign policy agenda. The left must play its part.

3/31/2022,"With a snarl, with a roar, with a facial morph into horrible sub-Voldemort nasal loss and then back to being handsome, the Marvel superhero-vampire Morbius is with us. And sadly his superpower is being bafflingly dull. His story unfolds with all the dramatic shape of a screensaver and then ends – to be followed by two plonkingly anti-climactic post-credit stings whose sheepish purpose is to lay out more coming attractions from the very corporate Sony’s Spider-Man Universe (SSU). in case we justifiably felt that all this was a bit of a letdown. Jared Leto plays the nobly dedicated Dr Michael Morbius, who affects a Charles Manson-style long hair-plus-beard combo to go with his gaunt unhealthy manner and Richard III caliper-canes. The poor man suffers from a blood disorder and has dedicated his life to a cure – so much so that he gets the Nobel prize for medicine in an early scene, but he’s such a badass that he turns it down at the ceremony. Or something; we never quite find out what he does or says to the poor old King of Sweden. But the point is supposedly that Dr Morbius had formed a lifelong friendship in a children’s hospital with the kid in the next bed with the same condition - and he grows up to be a needy, greedy individual called Milo (Matt Smith), quite without Dr Morbius’s ethical superiority. When Morbius desperately ingests vampire-bat blood in a last-ditch attempt at a cure, his resulting transformation into a super-strong vampire monster with extraordinary abs disturbs him so much he refuses to keep using it. Instead, he manufactures artificial blood from a secret lab once used by criminals for counterfeiting $100 bills. Because … obviously it’s very much the same sort of technology. But Milo – Hyde to his Jekyll – eagerly glugs the vampire-bat blood down and embraces his evil destiny, becoming Morbius’s enemy. Meanwhile, Morbius’s colleague Dr Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) has a shy tendresse for him, and Jared Harris has to play the two men’s sorrowing mentor Dr Emil Nikols. It really is an amazingly pointless and dumb film: the good/bad setup between Morbius and Milo is muddled and cancelled by the not-especially-compelling moral struggle within Morbius himself. Both Leto and Smith have to keep doing the evil demonic face-change growling thing, and it is intensely silly. Let’s hope the extended Spider-Man universe extends far enough to include something more interesting than this.  Morbius is released on 31 March in the UK and Australia, and on 1 April in the US.",Arts/Film,Morbius review – ludicrously pointless Jekyll and Hyde vampire-monster yarn,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/31/morbius-review-ludicrously-pointless-jekyll-and-hyde-vampire-monster-yarn
