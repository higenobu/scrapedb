2/18/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The Texas wildcatters that ushered in America’s shale revolution are resisting the temptation to pump more oil as the market rallies, signaling higher gasoline prices for consumers already battered by the worst inflation in a generation.

Influential players like Pioneer Natural Resources Co., Devon Energy Corp. and Harold Hamm’s Continental Resources Inc. just pledged to limit 2022 production increases to no more than 5%, a fraction of the 20% or higher annual growth rates meted out in the pre-pandemic era. The timing couldn’t be worse for consumers. Outside of OPEC, which has rejected U.S. President Joe Biden’s pleas to accelerate production increases, domestic shale fields are the only other source of crude that can quickly respond to supply shortfalls. Together with fast-rising global consumption, American drillers’ conservatism is likely to keep oil prices elevated for some time to come. “Whether it’s $150 oil, $200 oil, or $100 oil, we’re not going to change our growth plans,’’ Pioneer Chief Executive Officer Scott Sheffield said during a Bloomberg Television interview. “If the president wants us to grow, I just don’t think the industry can grow anyway.’’ To be sure, U.S. oil output will rise substantially this year and is forecast to return to pre-pandemic levels by 2023. But it probably won’t be enough to knock oil prices off their upward trajectory any time soon. Publicly-listed independent explorers like Pioneer and Devon account for more than half of the roughly 10.5 million barrels that America produces daily from fields in the contiguous 48 states, according to IHS Markit Ltd. The rest comes from closely held outfits, family-run enterprises and the international supermajors, all of which are aggressively boosting output. Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., for example, are targeting 25% and 10% shale growth, respectively, this year. At the same time, closely-held entities bankrolled by private-equity firms and family funds now control the majority of the country’s active drilling rigs. Going into this week’s quarterly earnings season, investors were apprehensive that the independents would evince signs of weakening discipline. After all, the benchmark North American oil price has surged 22% this year, at one point approaching $96 a barrel. That’s more than double the price needed to earn a healthy profit in places like the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. Retail gasoline at U.S. filling stations, meanwhile, is already higher than it’s been since 2014, an ominous sign in a market that closely tracks fluctuations in crude markets. “Whether it’s $150 oil, $200 oil, or $100 oil, we’re not going to change our growth plans.” — Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield But the message from shale country is loud and clear: the independents won’t repeat the mistakes of the past by flooding the world with cheap oil. Record cash flows will go right back to investors through dividends and buybacks, CEOs are saying. That means U.S. drillers are leaving a lot of crude in the ground. If they chose the other path — pouring windfall profits into new drilling — they easily could inflate domestic production by 2 million barrels a day, according to IHS Markit. Current forecasts are for the U.S. to add less than half that to global supplies this year. “We've had enough head fakes that we’re going to be very thoughtful in ramping activity up,"" Rick Muncrief, CEO of Devon Energy Corp., said during a phone interview. ""Let’s face it: we all are recovering in one way or another from this pandemic. We’re just slowly getting healthier and healthier over time, but you don’t get there overnight.” Such comments are a world away from the free-wheeling “drill, baby, drill’’ heyday earlier this century when shale upended global oil markets with year after year of record-high production. Seasoned CEOs like Muncrief, Sheffield and Hamm have seen too many bust cycles to get carried away again. The unprecedented oil-price crash of 2020 exposed an industry that burned through more than $200 billion over the previous decade to make America the world’s biggest crude producer, leaving little left for shareholders. Even after the rally in oil stocks over the past year, U.S. energy companies are just 3.6% of the S&P 500 Index, down from more than 12% a decade ago. “The growth experiment failed,” said Jeff Wyll, a senior analyst at fund manager Neuberger Berman Group LLC, which has about $400 billion of assets under management. “We are in a new paradigm.”The U.S. will add between 750,000 and 1 million barrels of daily output this year, according to recent estimates from the Energy Information Administration, Rystad Energy AS, ESAI Energy LLC and Lium LLC. But that’s less than a third of the International Energy Agency’s forecast for global demand growth, meaning it won’t be enough to tame the oil rally. “Whether it’s $150 oil, $200 oil, or $100 oil, we’re not going to change our growth plans.” — Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield It’s down to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the only two OPEC countries with significant spare capacity, to fill any supply gaps, according to Pioneer’s Sheffield. Crucially, independent U.S. drillers are still extremely wary of elbowing in on too much of the market share controlled by OPEC and its allies, which waged two price wars with shale in the space of less than 10 years. “U.S. shale has lost twice already in a head-to-head battle with OPEC,’’ said Devin McDermott, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. Independent producers are “focused on cleaning up balance sheets, lowering break even prices and returning cash back to investors -- not looking for growth.’’ Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Tourists Returning to Thailand Find Closed Bars, Empty Streets Peter Thiel Is Taking His Talents to Mar-a-Lago How Instagram’s ‘Billionaire Gucci Master’ Sank Nigeria’s Super Cop ‘Zero-Click’ Hacks Are Growing in Popularity.

2/18/2022,"Wall Street suggests tuning out of Roku (ROKU) after the streaming giant turned in a severe profit warning for 2022 as it invests back into its business. Shares of the company crashed 25% to $107 in pre-market trading Friday as the Street smashed down the reset button on Roku's valuation. ""We don't expect investors to hang on for the ride though. With a big cut to our EBITDA we take a much less optimistic view of Active Account value, so we slash our EV/Active Account-based valuation. We remain Equal Weight given the extent of the pull-back, but see Roku as dead money until proof points arise,"" Wells Fargo media analyst Steve Cahall said in a note. Roku saw slowing growth in the fourth quarter in areas such as active accounts and average revenue per user as people re-engaged with the real world again during the pandemic. The company's adjusted operating margins also dropped 750 basis points from a year ago amid supply chain disruptions weighing on the margins of Roku hardware. Here's how Roku performed in the fourth quarter versus Wall Street estimates: Net Sales: $865.3 million vs. $894 million Diluted EPS: $0.18 vs. $0.05 But Roku's outlook left much to be desired as the company goes into one of those Amazon-like investment cycles. For the full year, Roku sees adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) that is about in line with 2020 levels of $150 million. The Street was looking for roughly $535 million in adjusted operating profits. ""As we got through some of the worst uncertainty around the pandemic, we decided that we would continue or we kind of go back to our historical aggressive investment levels. And so, you're seeing strong investment in the back half of 2021 and into 2022,"" Roku CFO Steve Louden said on an earnings call. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

2/18/2022,"Will we ever return to a five-day in-office work week? Charlie Munger doesn’t think so. Even as COVD-19 restrictions ease across the U.S. and employers call on workers to resume in-person workdays, the famed investor said Wednesday during The Daily Journal’s annual shareholders meeting that he does not expect white-collar employees will ever return to in-person work full-time again. “It’s amazing the percentage of people in computer science that don’t want to be in the office for a normal life,” Munger said. “They want to do a lot of it from locations that are more convenient for them — I think that’s going to remain forever.” His view comes amid a broad push by leaders in corporate America to get staff back to the physical workplace as states increasingly drop mask mandates and lift pandemic-related restrictions. Most recently, Microsoft told U.S. employees to begin returning to their offices starting Feb. 28 in an attempt to resume normal operations as virus case numbers recede. Corporate employers have played back-and-forth for months on office policies amid changing guidelines from local government leaders and the ebbs and flows in coronavirus case counts across the country, with the Delta and Omicron variants disrupting plans for broader returns this past year. As the latest Omicron-driven wave appears to abate, on Wall Street, office attendance at financial giants including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have risen in recent weeks, while American Express said earlier this month it would ask New York employees to work from their offices at least once a week starting in March, embracing a hybrid model. But many employees who have become accustomed to working remotely over the past two years have resisted calls for full-time onsite returns, especially as some companies continue to embrace at-home work and experiment with hybrid schedules. A recent survey conducted by the Advanced Workplace Associates, global management consulting firm, of nearly 10,000 people working in the finance, technology and energy sectors around the world found that only 3% of white-collar employees are willing to return to full-time office hours. In the U.S., 84% of survey participants said they want to work from home two or more days a week. “Employers have to realize that the genie is out of the bottle,” AWA managing director Andrew Mawson said in a statement. “Workers have seen that flexibility can work and bosses who are not sensitive to their employees’ needs will suffer accordingly.” At The Daily Journal meeting, Munger also suggested that a full recovery in business travel was unlikely. “I don’t think the average corporation is going to fly its directors around so they can sit at the same table for every meeting of the year,” Munger said. “The Berkshire Hathaway directors have met face-to-face twice a year and done everything else on the telephone or with consent minutes, and it’s worked fine,” he added. “I don’t think we needed all these goddamn meetings and airplane flights.” While Munger argued that completing business activities remotely has made certain components of work “simpler, cheaper, and more efficient,” he argued, on the other hand, that federal stimulus for workers sidelined during the pandemic has been too liberal. “What makes capitalism work is the fact that if you’re an able-bodied young person, if you refuse to work, you suffer a fair amount of agony, and because of that agony, the whole economic system works,” he said, adding effective, prospering economies have traditionally imposed hardship on young people who don’t want to work. “You take away that hardship and say ‘you can stay home and get more than if you come in to work,’ that’s quite disruptive to an economic system like ours,” Munger added. “The next time we do this, I don’t think we ought to be so liberal.” — Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
