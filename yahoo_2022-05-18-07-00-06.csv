5/18/2022,"Surveillance footage from China showed an 8-year-old boy violently stomping on the head of a 2-year-old girl to steal the snacks she was carrying.

On May 5, the boy, named Zhuang, entered the toddler’s home in Haikou where she was playing alone, according to a Weibo post from Owl Video. He allegedly demanded that the toddler hand over her snacks, but when she refused, he began to beat her.

In the surveillance footage, the boy is seen kicking the 2-year-old to the ground before violently stomping on her head. He attempts to stomp on the toddler again as she tries to stand up, but he runs away after the girl’s grandfather yells out.

The toddler suffered head trauma and four loose teeth which required two months of treatment.

Zhuang’s parents initially denied their son’s involvement in the attack until they saw the surveillance footage. When the toddler’s parents confronted the boy, he responded, “I beat whenever I want.”

In an open letter at the end of the Weibo video, the 2-year-old’s mother stated that their family has never had issues with Zhuang’s family. They reportedly refused to apologize or express any remorse. Zhuang’s parents also allegedly said they cannot afford compensation and begged the toddler’s family not to report the attack to the police.

The toddler’s parents reported the attack to the police after Zhuang’s parents continued not to apologize. The case is now under investigation.

Weibo users criticized Chinese juvenile crime laws, with some suggesting that the boy may have antisocial personality disorder.

“I feel like it was an attempted murder. If someone hadn't shouted when he kicked her like this, he would have kicked her to death. After all, 2-year-olds are still very fragile,” one user wrote.

“Beating a 2-year-old child like this for bad reasons? This kind of person feels that sooner or later he will commit a crime, and it is recommended that he be locked up in a children's correctional center, and he will be released after he has been educated,” another user commented.

5/18/2022,"PHOENIX (AP) — The Arizona Senate on Monday opened an ethics investigation into a firebrand Republican member who tweeted inflammatory comments about last weekend's racist attack at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket that left 10 people dead. The referral of Sen. Wendy Rogers of Flagstaff to the Ethics Committee was in lieu of the immediate expulsion that Democratic lawmakers were planning, GOP Majority Leader Rick Gray said. Due process considerations require no less than an ethics investigation, he said. But Democrats were furious, noting that Rogers was just censured in March for a repeated series of tweets and statements that embraced white nationalism and called for violence. Despite a bipartisan 24-3 vote on the Republican plan to open an ethics committee review that could lead to an expulsion, censure or reprimand, Democrats failed to get any Republicans to back their motion to expel Rogers. On Saturday, as news of the mass shooting by a white suspect who had posted a racist screed on the internet and driven about 200 miles (322 kilometers) to a primarily Black neighborhood in Buffalo, Rogers tweeted “Fed boy summer has started in Buffalo.” Many in both parties took that tweet to mean that Rogers was blaming the attack on the federal government, especially in light of Rogers' history of embracing conspiracy theories and posting of racist tropes. Republican leaders of the Senate tried to get in front of the controversy Monday morning, putting out a statement condemning the violence and “all hate speech that has served as an inspiration for these kinds of heinous crimes.” Without naming Rogers, the statement said “words have consequences, and while we believe in our first amendment rights of free speech, we denounce any and all extremist rhetoric that has fueled these horrendous acts.” Only three members voted not to open the ethics probe, including Rogers and Republican Sen. Warren Petersen, who said he hadn't even heard of the controversy when he walked onto the Senate floor. Republican Sen. Kelly Townsend, who is challenging Rogers in the GOP primary after redistricting put both in the same district, also opposed the ethics probe. Townsend said Rogers' comments were an embarrassment to the state and the Republican Party and added to the pain of the families of those killed in Buffalo. “But she has a right to make them,” Townsend said. “I have to defend a person's right to say ugly things. That's why the First Amendment exists. It doesn't exist for the kind words — it exists for the ugly words.” Rogers issued a statement after the vote slamming Democrats for what she said was an effort to divide Republicans, and said her now-deleted tweet was misinterpreted. “Sadly, my comment was taken completely out of context and became a false narrative that’s now the focal point of a firestorm created by certain race-obsessed members of the media,” Rogers statement said. The hours-long debate in the Senate over what to do about Rogers devolved into a fracas, with Republicans accusing Democrats of trying to make political hay and Democrats accusing GOP members of a pattern of dodging uncomfortable discussions about race relations by shutting down any debate on the issue. Republican Sen. Sonny Borrelli called it an example of cancel culture from Democrats who dislike Rogers and her brand of politics. Others agreed that Rogers' words were being used against her. “This is not an expellable offense,” Republican Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita said. “The Ds are politicizing it.” She called it a dangerous precedent to consider expelling or even censuring a member for their tweets or comments. GOP Sen. J.D. Mesnard, who was House speaker when a member was expelled in 2018 after a series of sexual misconduct allegations, said hearings and an ethics committee process were imperative. “This is the equivalent of a legislative execution,"" Mesnard said of the motion to expel Rogers. ""That’s why due process and an ethics process and investigation is so critical.” Democrats pointed to Rogers' previous problems, which started the month she was sworn into office in 2021 when a staffer accused her of bullying and other unprofessional conduct, and the March 2022 censure, which also was approved by a 24-3 vote with three members not present. Townsend was absent, but said she would have voted yes. “How many times do you allow your children to get out of hand before you provide the opportunity for discipline,” Democratic Sen. Theresa Hatathlie said. “Discipline is a teaching moment. That is something we have already had.” Democratic Sen. Martin Quezada said much the same, and accused GOP members of “kicking the can down the road,” by not taking immediate action. He said Rogers' tweets needed no investigation, and those and her history were all that was in play. “Now there’s a track record, now there’s a pattern of behavior,” Quezada said. “We haven’t heard any effort to defend those actions. And my assumption is because there is no defense to those actions."" Rogers made no comment on the floor of the Senate where the other members spent hours discussing her.",Politics/Associated Press,Arizona state senator slammed for Buffalo shooting comments,https://news.yahoo.com/arizona-state-senator-slammed-buffalo-003620444.html
5/18/2022,"Apparently, we’ve all been using sticky notes completely wrong, according to one TikToker at least. How to avoid panic buying in an ultra-competitive housing market There’s nothing more disappointing than whipping out a Post-it note for an important reminder, only for it to unstick from the surface and get lost. Apparently, however, this isn’t a matter of product malfunction so much as it is one of user error. TikToker Ali Abdaal recently learned the correct way to use a Post-it note and shared how in a quick video. Watch this Brooklyn bedroom go from drab to fabulous in one day: “I was today years old when I realized I’ve been using Post-its all wrong,” Abdaal wrote in the caption. “You’re probably using Post-it notes wrong,” he explained in the video. Here’s how you use them properly. Normally we rip off Post-it notes like this. But the problem is that it naturally wants to unstick itself.” Instead, he suggested, placing the Post-it note pad sideways and pulling the note off that way. “Then it sticks properly,” he said. Because the note isn’t bent upward, it’s less likely to peel off and unstick. The useful tip racked up over 300,000 views on TikTok. “Are we just doing everything wrong?” someone joked. “Might not be the biggest thing but I just learned something new,” another wrote. “I’ve been doing this forever. I didn’t know others were doing it wrong,” a person commented. “True. I found out this myself accidentally,” a user replied. “Who knew Post-it notes needed directions on the package?” a TikToker responded.

5/18/2022,"Even before the SWAT team rolled into Lake Arrowhead last weekend, people around Clinton County had been talking about James Larson Jr. “What I heard — and I reported this to a Clinton County Sheriff’s detective on May 2 — is that a guy had just been released from prison in Oklahoma, had family here, was hanging around causing trouble, and he had a long, violent rap sheet that included assault on an officer,” said Steve Berg, a board member of the private community located 35 miles northeast of downtown Kansas City. “All I heard was he was bad news,” said a neighbor of Larson’s father, who asked not to be identified for privacy reasons. “I didn’t ask any questions. He was staying across the street with his father, and ever since the son got here a lot more cars had been driving by.” On Saturday, traffic on that remote gravel road was even heavier. It included an armored personnel carrier, multiple squad cars, a police dog, and tactical officers from several local law enforcement agencies, all engaged in a five-hour standoff with Larson, who authorities say assaulted, tortured and held captive a woman in his father’s house. Larson was taken into custody, and the woman, whom authorities have not publicly identified, has been at an area hospital since Saturday, authorities say. Monday night, the Clinton County Prosecutor’s Office announced charges against Larson: first-degree domestic assault, felony kidnapping, felony armed criminal action and felony possession of a firearm. Earlier Monday, his father, James Larson Sr., drove up to the gated entrance to Lake Arrowhead to meet with reporters and give his side of the story. His version went like this: Larson was released from prison in March. He stayed in Oklahoma for a month, then returned to Clinton County a week and a half ago. Larson owned a camper on some property at Lake Arrowhead, but the first day he was back, somebody set it on fire. (His father implied the fire was intentionally set, but did not say by who, or why.) So he moved in with his father. “I thought he was a changed man,” his father said. “It was good for about a week.” Around 3 p.m. on Friday, May 13, his father went to see family in St. Joseph. Before he left, he met a woman his son had brought over to the house. When he returned, around 8 p.m., “my son was not my son — he was not who I thought he was,” he said. Larson had destroyed the house while he was away. “I don’t know if he was blacked out, or drunk, I don’t know what kind of chemicals he was taking or injecting. I just know it was not him. And it just got sideways after that.” He said he saw his son pull the woman’s hair, but, he did not believe she had ever been locked in a room or sexually assaulted. “I didn’t see what happened, all I know is he probably hurt her real bad,” he said. The charging documents released Monday night generally support that account but round out the narrative with grim details. Larson and the woman, 31, met on Facebook Dating four days prior to the standoff. Everything was fine for a few days until Thursday, when “it was like a flip of the switch” and he began beating her, she would later tell police. Larson “punched her with closed fists, kicked her with steel-toe boots, and hit her in the head with what she described as an ice pick,” according to the probable cause statement. Her jeans were “wet with urine” because Larson wouldn’t allow her to use the restroom. He wouldn’t let her eat, either, she said, and he gave her a drink Friday morning that “tasted like medicine.” As of Sunday, she was still “having trouble breathing, hurts all over, and cannot walk,” according to court records. She had no broken bones. Larson denied most of the woman’s allegations to police, according to Monday night’s filing. He said he “never laid a hand on her or kicked her in any way” and had never touched any guns in his father’s residence. He said the woman already had a lump on her neck when he met her, the result of being “pistol whipped” by someone she’d been staying with previously. Larson’s cousin, Donny Larson, was also present at the home. At one point, Larson passed out, his father said. The two other men then tried to help the woman leave. “We told her to go up this road and take left and two rights and don’t look back,” Larson Sr. said. “But she kept not wanting to leave.” Instead, he said, his nephew left “because he got scared of what my son might do.” When Larson woke up, sometime in the night, he found a hidden shotgun in the home. “He cocked it, went into the kitchen and said he was going to shoot her, then going to shoot himself,” Larson Sr. said. “I pleaded for him to stop for 15 or 20 minutes. I begged him.” Larson eventually handed over the gun, which his father hid in the garage, and locked the door behind him. He stayed in the garage for several hours. From his phone, connected to a camera inside his house, he watched as his son went on a rampage, “smashing holes in the wall, smacking things around, screaming.” Once, when things died down, he went back inside to try to find keys to help the woman escape. He said he found her in the fetal position, sweating on the bedroom floor. But he couldn’t find his keys. Why didn’t he simply call the police? “I was in fear of his life, her life,” he said. “I thought SWAT was gonna come in here and take him out. I did what I thought would be best for his safety and his life, her life, and my own. I don’t know. It probably would have been a better decision.” Sometime in the morning — he didn’t sleep — Larson Sr. heard someone outside speak his name. It sounded like it was coming out of a microphone. It was the police. They were asking him to come out of the house. “Of course, that’s my son’s name, too,” he said. Larson Sr. exited the garage with his hands up and was taken into custody but not arrested. The woman had finally escaped the house and asked a neighbor to call the police. The neighbor that did not want to be identified said the woman “had scratches and blood on her hands” and what appeared to be a stab wound on her leg. The SWAT team arrived and, after five hours, entered the house, finding Larson hiding in a wall. He was cuffed and booked into the Clinton County jail, where he remains. The events of this past weekend are not the only time in the past year that law enforcement has been called to the Lake Arrowhead home of James Larson Sr. He summoned Clinton County Sheriff’s deputies there in December, saying a burglary was in progress. Officers walked into a perplexing scene. According to court records, he was holding a rifle, which he handed over to a deputy. He said he believed he had trapped the burglar by locking the man in his bedroom. He had also fired approximately nine shots into the room, through the closed door. The deputies found no sign of forced entry or anyone in the house, besides his 10-year-old grandson, who was soon placed in the custody of the state. Larson Sr. was charged with unlawful use of a weapon and endangering the welfare of a child. “I lost my grandkids due to, I was exercising my Second Amendment rights protecting my property,” he said. The probable cause statement notes that he has a long criminal history dating back to 1982. It includes convictions for third degree assault, misdemeanor for making a false police report and misdemeanor unlawful use of a weapon. His son, 39, has been serving time in the Oklahoma Department of Corrections for most of the past eight years, convicted of assault and battery on a law enforcement officer and escaping from detention, among other crimes, records show. He was also picked up at a BP station in Holt, a few miles south of Lake Arrowhead, almost immediately upon returning to Clinton County earlier this month. A clerk working the register on Monday was surprised to learn that one of the men arrested at the gas station a couple Fridays back had been involved in the SWAT standoff over the weekend. “It was just a suspicious situation,” he told The Star. “There were these two guys sitting in their car out front there for a good half-hour, right before closing time. The driver was wearing one of those gaiters around his neck, and he kept pulling it up over his mouth and looking in here. And the other guy was wearing a long black leather trench coat. It was warm out. Why’s a guy wearing a leather trench coat? It was getting to be the time when I needed to count the drawer. So I called the county.” When the sheriff’s deputies arrived and started asking questions of the men outside, they learned that the one in the long black trench coat — Larson — had a warrant out for his arrest in Clinton County. They also found a gram of cocaine and a gram of meth in the car. Larson and his friend were hauled off to jail. But Larson wasn’t there long. Clinton County Sheriff Larry Fish told Fox4 on Monday that, prior to this weekend’s events, “We kind of expected something would happen because the subject … is a violent career criminal.” But despite that, and despite the outstanding warrant in Clinton County, an apparent violation of his probation in Oklahoma, and his lengthy history as a violent criminal, Larson was released on his own recognizance — no bail necessary — three days later. The Clinton County Sheriff’s Office did not return a call Monday evening seeking an explanation for why Larson wasn’t kept in jail. Monday afternoon, his father led reporters past the Lake Arrowhead gate and down a winding path to his home. Two friendly dogs roamed around an overgrown yard filled with junk: a pile of plywood, a broken vacuum cleaner, part of an old Taco Bell sign. “That one’s Jr.’s,” his father said, pointing at one of the dogs. “He needs to go to the vet. I guess I’m gonna have to take him.”",U.S./Kansas City Star,"‘My son was not my son’: Grisly details emerge in Clinton County, MO, torture case",https://news.yahoo.com/son-not-son-grisly-details-152305398.html
