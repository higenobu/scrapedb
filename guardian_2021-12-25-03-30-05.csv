12/25/2021,"The rising wave of the Omicron variant has helped drive Covid rates to record highs in England, with one in 35 now infected across the country and one in 20 infected in London, official figures show. Based on random swab tests taken in the community, the Office for National Statistics estimates that nearly 3% or 1,544,600 people in England had Covid between 13 and 19 December, with infection rates higher than last week in all regions except the south-west.  Rates of Covid were highest in London where one in 20 were infected in the week studied, and lowest in the north-east where the rate was stood at 1 in 55 people, according to the ONS infection survey released on Friday, While London remains the centre of the omicron wave, the ONS said swab results compatible with omicron infections rose in all regions of England, and in all nations of the UK, compared with last week’s survey. Esther Sutherland, a senior statistician on the Covid-19 infection survey, said the rise in infections was seen across almost all age groups, with the figures suggesting that the rapid spread of omicron was “a significant factor in recent trends.” Further data from the ONS showed that people from Pakistani, Caribbean and African backgrounds were least likely to have taken up the offer of a Covid booster or third dose of the vaccine, which provides substantial extra protection against the omicron variant. Uptake of boosters and third doses among those aged 50 and over was 42.2% for Pakistani, 44.4% for black Caribbean, and 45.4% for black African groups, the ONS said. Figures up to 12 December suggest that more than a quarter of people of black Caribbean ethnicity have yet to receive a first dose of Covid vaccine, making them the least vaccinated ethnic group in the UK. “This is deeply worrying because in many ways I fear a repetition of what happened in the first wave, where … we saw this rather alarming and disturbing disparity in illness and deaths among ethnic minorities from Covid,” Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chair at the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4’s World at One. “What we know now of course is that the patients, people who are becoming seriously ill, who are being hospitalised, are those who have not been vaccinated and those who have not had their boosters,” he added. The report came as new documents from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) noted that infection rates and hospitalisations were “rising fast” in London, and that “as infections move into older age groups, a large wave of hospital admissions should be expected.” According to the minutes of a Sage meeting held on Thursday, scientists are unclear whether an apparent fall in the growth rate in omicron infections is a genuine slowing down in the spread of the virus. A real slowdown could be driven by changes in people’s mixing patterns and behaviour – such as being more risk averse in the run up to Christmas – or a fall in the number of susceptible people to infect in particular groups. But other factors may feed in, the scientists stress, such as people not testing in case they have to isolate, and longer testing turnaround times.",News/World news,One in 35 had Covid in England last week as Omicron drives record infections,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/24/one-in-35-people-have-covid-in-uk-as-omicron-drives-record-infections
12/25/2021,"LadBaby have scored their fourth consecutive Christmas No 1, making them the first artist to ever achieve that feat – while an expletive-strewn protest against Boris Johnson has reached the festive top five. LadBaby’s four Christmas No 1s puts them level with the Beatles, who topped the Christmas chart in 1963, 64, 65 and 67.  But where the Beatles’ songs – I Want to Hold Your Hand, I Feel Fine, Day Tripper and Hello, Goodbye – covered everything from LSD dilettantes to the joys of young love, LadBaby’s have all been focused on the gastronomic brilliance of sausage rolls. The duo – YouTuber Mark Hoyle and his wife Roxanne – have created the series of comedy cover versions to raise money for the Trussell Trust, a food bank charity. In 2018 they covered Starship’s We Built This City (its foundations recast from rock’n’roll to sausage rolls), and followed it with Joan Jett’s I Love Rock’n’Roll twisted into I Love Sausage Rolls. For 2020, they reheated the formula with Don’t Stop Me Eatin’, their riff on Journey’s perennial soft rock anthem Don’t Stop Believin’. This year, the couple looked to have stiff competition from Ed Sheeran and Elton John, who seemed to regard the Christmas No 1 with the kind of determined festive focus shared by high-street retailers, the hospitality industry and children – they called their song Merry Christmas, and decked it with sleigh bells and lyrics about mistletoe, snow and fires aglow. It too was a charity release, to benefit the artists’ foundations. But the pair gave LadBaby a boost by letting them do a cover of Merry Christmas and appearing on the recording, titled Sausage Rolls for Everyone. Their own version is at No 2 this week, having spent two weeks at No 1, though they are still each credited alongside LadBaby with a Christmas No 1 win. It marks Sheeran’s fourth No 1 of the year, and Elton John’s third. LadBaby thanked everyone who had streamed and downloaded Sausage Rolls for Everyone, saying: “Thank you for helping us raise the profile, raise money and awareness for the Trussell Trust, the food banks in the UK and helping support the 14 million people in this country that are living below the poverty line. We couldn’t have done it without you.” At No 3 in the chart is Wham’s Last Christmas, which is yet to achieve a Christmas No 1 spot, though did finally reach the top just after Christmas last year – its first such placing since its release in 1984. At No 4 is another classic, Mariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas Is You, which also reached No 1 for the first time last year. At No 5, the festive mood darkens considerably for the protest song Boris Johnson is Still a Fucking Cunt, by punk band the Kunts. Lifting the tune from Gary Glitter’s Rock and Roll Part II, it’s a 64-second follow-up to their 2020 song Boris Johnson is a Fucking Cunt, which also reached No 5. The similarly sweary and un-festive ABCDEFU, by 17-year-old TikTok star Gayle, is at No 6. New Christmas recordings elsewhere in this year’s chart include George Ezra’s Come on Home for Christmas at No 10 (a cover of Please Come Home for Christmas by Charles Brown), and Olivia Dean’s cover of Nat King Cole’s The Christmas Song at No 27. There are 29 Christmas songs in the chart in total, including favourites such as the Pogues’ Fairytale of New York (No 7), Shakin’ Stevens’ Merry Christmas Everyone (8), Brenda Lee’s Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree (9), Chris Rea’s Driving Home for Christmas (12), Wizzard’s I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday (17), Leona Lewis’s One More Sleep (21) and Slade’s Merry Xmas Everybody (24). Adele has the No 1 album at Christmas, with 30 spending its fifth week at the top. It is now the joint longest-running No 1 album of the year, with Olivia Rodrigo’s Sour.",Arts/Music,LadBaby equal Beatles record with fourth Christmas No 1,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/24/ladbaby-equal-beatles-record-with-fourth-christmas-no-1
12/25/2021,"On the eve of their tribe’s settlement with the crown, Gabrielle Huria and Te Maire Tau walked out on to the cracked, dry earth of Tūtaepatu lagoon’s bed. The lagoon’s edges, once thick with flax, had been choked by imported weed, spiralling blackberry and English willow. The streams that fed it had been giving up their waters to irrigate the surrounding dairy farms and having them returned in a swill of effluent. Finally, they had run dry. On the far shoreline was the place where the tribe used to give up their dead to the mud, lowering them into its dark, hidden reaches along the waterline. Now the mud had baked to concrete, cracked and cratered like a desert. On its surface, thousands of tuna, the native eels so valued by the tribe, lay dead or dying in the sun, their smell mingling with that of the drying silt. Above them, birds were circling – so large that Tau thought for a moment he was seeing eagles. But they were only hawks, fat from so much carrion.  “We wondered if it was a tohu” – an omen or sign, Huria says, looking out at the lagoon more than 20 years later. “But Te Maire said it just signified a change – things were different.” The lagoon would be returned to them that year in the tribe’s 1998 treaty settlement, and in the decades since, volunteers have gradually transformed it: pulling out the introduced weeds and vines, replanting with harakeke flax and fern, nursing back plant species to help filter the waterways that feed it. Huria and Tau are two prominent leaders within Ngāi Tahu, New Zealand’s largest southern tribe, and they now have their sights on a larger battle: authority over the South Island’s water. The tribe is taking New Zealand’s government to court, for what they allege have been repeated failures over successive governments to protect the country’s waterways. They argue that the crown must recognise their rangatiratanga – governing authority and self-determination – over waterways stretching across most of the South Island. The legal case is unprecedented and dances across political, cultural and economic battles playing out across the country: New Zealand’s economic reliance on dairy, and a colonial legacy placing farming at the heart of its culture, is increasingly pitted against its clean green image, climate commitments and growing movements for Māori sovereignty over their natural resources. Those currents compete in the argument over South Island rivers, which flow through some of the country’s most fragile natural landscapes and its most prosperous farming country. Te Maire Tau moves along the banks of the Ashley/Rakahuri River at a steady lope then pauses to hold up a hand. “This is good wind for eeling,” he says. The cold easterly sweeping down off the alps will dry a hanging eel fillet quickly. To his right the water flows, sluggish brown, its bottom thick with mud, algae carpeting the shingle. A blue heron moves slowly through the sludge then its beak spears down, the silver slip of a minnow catching the light. “You know what I feel sorry for? These poor birds, eating out of this bloody filth,” Tau says. “Well,” says Huria, following him in a green raincoat. “We eat out of it.” Many of the waters that flow through Ngāi Tahu lands have been contaminated. The fish and eels that the tribe has hunted for generations are threatened. The puha watercress they pull from the creekbeds reeks of effluent. The rivers bloom green and black with toxic algae, so poisonous that a clump the size of a coin can kill a dog in 30 minutes. Their state reflects a much wider, long-brewing crisis with New Zealand’s fresh waterways. About 60% are unswimmable, 74% of freshwater fish are threatened or at risk of extinction and 95% of rivers flowing through pastoral land are contaminated. University of Otago research this year found 800,000 New Zealanders were drinking water with unsafe levels of nitrate contamination. In 2016, more than 5,000 people fell ill after a town’s waterways were contaminated with E coli. In 2017, then prime ministerial candidate Jacinda Ardern made cleaning up the country’s waterways a campaign promise. “Clean water is the birthright of all of us. I want future generations to be able to swim in the local river, just like I did,” she said. Since then, however, progress has been slow or nonexistent. The government introduced stricter regulations last year, but they are expected to take five years to improve water quality. The degradation of those waterways represents far more than the loss of a food source or recreational playground, Tau says. Rivers are woven deep into the fabric of Māori identity. A pepeha, the traditional form for greeting, begins by stating those foundational connections: this is my name, my tribe, my river, my mountain. “Fundamentally to us, there is no other identity. This is who we are,” Tau says. “All our old people, they weep about it,” says Huria, chief executive of Te Kura Taka Pini, the tribe’s freshwater group. “When they get together and talk, they start weeping about what the river was to them and what it is now. “Spiritual identity is tied up in it, their sense of place and our sense of place. For me what breaks my heart is our kids won’t be able to do any of it [fishing, swimming or gathering traditional foods] because it’s too dirty. As a parent your whole purpose is to pass on to your children the messages of your generation, and what do we pass on to them? Something broken and dying.” The takiwā (tribal territory) of Ngāi Tahu covers almost all of the South Island. Lying at its centre are the Canterbury plains, New Zealand’s largest area of flat land, formed over thousands of years as gravel and sediment washed down from the mountains of the Southern Alps. The debris formed a land of porous layers – soil, shingle, gravel, silt. An often-hidden network of water seeps endlessly through it via braided rivers and ribboning creeks, flood plains, wetlands, subterranean aquifers. For Ngāi Tahu, the plains were a jewel – a rich and abundant food basket, filled with eels, fish, bird life, cress and root vegetables. Today the plains are still a provider of food and prosperity: they form the heart of New Zealand’s lucrative multibillion-dollar dairy industry, which accounts for 3% of the country’s GDP and 20% of total exports. Over the past 30 years, Canterbury dairy cattle have increased 973% – from 113,000 to sit at 1.2-1.3 million in the last five years. Among them are Ngāi Tahu’s own cattle – the tribe’s business arm has a substantial farming investment. To transform the dry, wind-whipped plains into the lush grass expanses dairy cattle need to graze, farmers began pumping up vast quantities of water and pouring it out over the land, along with nitrogen-rich fertiliser. The region has become the most irrigated in the country. “The problem is not so much the irrigation, it’s what it allows,” says Dr Mike Joy, a freshwater ecologist at Victoria University. “It allows the intensification. It goes from a few scraggly sheep to thousands – actually 1.3 million – cows.” Courtesy of those cows, many of Canterbury’s fields are doused in nitrates twice, Joy says – fertiliser to grow the grass and then again with their effluent. In high concentrations, nitrogen becomes toxic: linked to cancer and blue baby syndrome in humans, and causing the algal blooms that suffocate life in the rivers. Most proposed solutions, Joy says, are nowhere near radical enough – focusing on mitigation strategies when New Zealand needs to radically diminish the pollutants it puts into waterways. “If you have a pot of milk on the stove and it’s boiling over, the solution that seems to be the popular one is to get a tea towel – and then maybe buy some more tea towels,” Joy says. “The only way you fix this is to turn the gas off. You can’t fix something while you’re still polluting it.” Ngāi Tahu’s court case, they say, is a step towards a more radical approach. “For too long, governments have talked about addressing these issues but have made piecemeal progress,” Ngāi Tahu chair Lisa Tumahai said as the court case was filed. “That is not enough. Now is the time to act.” The argument is part of a wider raft of cases over water from iwi (tribes), and their claim follows a precedent-setting 2017 case, in which the Whanganui River was granted legal personhood. Rangatiratanga, the tribe says, is not the same as ownership – it indicates governing authority and rights but also responsibility for protection. The office of David Parker, the environment minister and attorney general, did not return a request for comment – the government does not typically comment on ongoing litigation. But any possible shift in the balance of control of the water that feeds the country’s biggest export can cause ripples of discomfort or outrage. As the government floated a set of reforms towards co-governance with iwi over water, opposition leader Judith Collins claimed the tribes would “own” the water – and took to social media to stir controversy. “What is your view – should your local council have to pay iwi for drinking water? Who owns water?” she asked supporters online. “No one should have to pay iwi anything, for anything,” came one reply. “They are tearing our country apart,” said another, while others decried it as “separatism” and “racism”. Collins subsequently accepted she had mischaracterised the tribe’s proposal, and that Ngāi Tahu has not proposed ownership of water. But her rhetoric set a tone that would continue over the coming months, and in 2021 “separatism” became an increasingly prominent thread in the centre-right of New Zealand politics. Chris Allen, spokesperson on water quality for the lobby group Federated Farmers, says with hindsight there’s “a lot” of dairy conversions that wouldn’t have been carried out. “But there’s a free market and some decided to perhaps learn the hard way. We didn’t have rules or limits … We now do.”Farming alone was not responsible for water degradation in New Zealand, Allen said, adding some of the country’s most polluted rivers ran through cities. He said farmers were aware of the problems and focused on solutions. Some Canterbury farmers would have to dramatically reduce their nitrogen loss – some by up to 30% – or face penalties.“We’re on a journey. And that journey has been going on for Canterbury for well over 10 years.“We’ve got to get the balance right,” he says. “That’s really hard. If it was easy, it would have been done a long time ago.” For Māori, Tau argues, the degradation of the waterways and the loss of healthy rivers and streams is another form of confiscation, layered atop the historic expropriation of land and waterways. “The one traumatic event that featured in the lives of the grandparents and parents was dislocation from the land,” he says. As the rivers die, he sees the resulting alienation from the natural landscape and waters as a similar process, repeating. “The same has happened with culture and identity in the landscape: you become more and more dislocated.”",News/World news,"Trauma, dislocation, pollution: why Māori leaders want control of the South Island’s water",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/25/trauma-dislocation-pollution-why-maori-leaders-want-control-of-the-south-islands-water
12/25/2021,"The home secretary, Priti Patel, has repeatedly promised to curb the number of people arriving on UK shores in small boats by making this route “unviable” but more than 27,000 refugees have crossed the Channel this way, up from 8,500 in 2020. The Home Office is now planning to introduce a tagging scheme for asylum seekers after a reportedly “exasperated” Boris Johnson ordered a review. It is the latest proposal in a string of ideas aimed at clamping down on small boat arrivals, none of which have been successful at curbing numbers so far.  In autumn it emerged that Patel was preparing to push small boats carrying migrants back to France, despite warnings from government lawyers that such manoeuvres might be unlawful. The Home Office confirmed that Border Force staff were being trained to employ “turn-around” tactics at sea under plans developed for two years. Patel was also seeking to introduce legal protections for Border Force staff sending boats back in the event of a refugee drowning as a result. The French government rejected the turn-around plan on the grounds it could endanger lives. Another much-mooted idea was to send asylum seekers to another country, such as Gibraltar or islands in the South Atlantic, while their claims are processed. It triggered cross-party anger. Plans for a “potential offshoring of asylum processing centres for those using clandestine entry routes to the UK” were quickly likened to Australia’s problematic offshoring of asylum seekers to places such as Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Since the start of 2020, the UK government has been seeking to crack down on Channel crossings by prosecuting people who steer small boats carrying asylum seekers. But the policy, under which the government brought 67 successful prosecutions related to the piloting of small boats under smuggling laws, was challenged last week, resulting in a defeat for the government. The court of appeal ruled that convictions of four asylum seekers for driving small boats across the Channel “must be quashed in due course”, citing systemic failings. The judges said convictions of this kind were subject to the prosecution being able to prove that the person accused of steering the boat “knew or had reasonable cause to believe that his act was assisting entry or attempted entry into the United Kingdom without leave”. Under the Home Office’s “new plan for immigration”, Patel is expected to announce early in the new year that small boat arrivals will be electronically tagged. Ministers hope tagging working-age people would make it harder for them to work illegally while their asylum claims are processed, and make it easier to remove those whose application for asylum has failed. The plan has been described as “desperate and draconian” by the chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants. Patel has also tried to solve the issue financially: so far, she has agreed two multimillion-pound deals with the French authorities – one for more than £28m in November 2020 and one for at least £54m in July – to increase surveillance of the 93 miles of French coastline from which attempts to reach the UK have been launched. Repeated requests from the UK government for joint Channel patrols with the help of Border Force and French navy personnel have been rejected by France. Campaigners for refugees have claimed that opening safe and legal application routes for asylum seekers hoping to come to the UK – an option that does not exist for almost all people seeking refuge in Britain – would deter many from attempting to make the dangerous crossing in small boats. The Home Office still requires people to physically reach the UK before an asylum application can be lodged.",News/UK news,Tagging migrants likely to be another failed plan to stop Channel crossings,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/24/tagging-migrants-likely-to-be-another-failed-plan-to-stop-channel-crossings
