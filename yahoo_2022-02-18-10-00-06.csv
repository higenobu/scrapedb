2/18/2022,"Five officials at a private Christian academy in Texas are facing felony charges over accusations they failed to notify authorities after a ninth-grader reported being sexually assaulted by an older student during a hazing incident on “freshman initiation day.” The three administrators and two athletic coaches at Midland Christian School are identified in an arrest warrant affidavit obtained by The Daily Beast as Superintendent Jared Owen Lee, secondary school Principal Dana Elizabeth Ellis, athletic director Gregory Neal McClendon, assistant secondary school principal Matthew David Counts, and baseball coach Barry Lee Russell. “We are motivated in all facets by our faith in Jesus Christ, attempting to serve as a reflection of God’s unconditional love for all people,” Midland Christian’s website proclaims. “We seek to honor the Lord in all that we do by operating Midland Christian School in a manner consistent with Biblical principles. It is important to us that every word and deed engaged in by Midland Christian School, its employees, representatives, volunteers, and students be consistent with and in furtherance of Midland Christian School’s religious purposes: both publicly and privately.” But the five school officials apparently did not live up to those tenets following the alleged January attack, which was first exposed by the Midland Reporter-Telegram. On Jan. 28, a detective with the Midland Police Department was notified about a “possible sexual assault of a child” that had occurred eight days earlier after baseball practice at Midland Christian. ‘Go Back to China!’: Christian School Teacher Fired Over Nasty Anti-Asian Rant In an interview with authorities, the unnamed victim said he had just stepped into the locker room to get changed when the lights were turned off. Someone said it was “freshman initiation day,” and a 10th-grader began hitting the ninth-grader. The ninth-grader’s hands were pinned down, and he was flipped over onto his back, the affidavit states. He was then sexually assaulted with a baseball bat as other students looked on and cheered, it says. The next day, the freshman student told school officials what had happened. And then, nothing. “The two of them see each other every day as they are on the same baseball team,” the affidavit goes on. On Feb. 11, police investigators showed up at Midland Christian and spoke with Ellis, the principal of the secondary school. She told cops that she was aware of the incident and that it had been documented. However, Ellis said Lee, the school superintendent, was the only one with access to the files. When Ellis told Lee about the horrific incident, Lee ordered McClendon and Counts to “conduct an ‘investigation’ into the incident instead of notifying law enforcement or another state agency,” the affidavit explains. But when Lee contacted police on Feb. 14, he refused to answer any questions or provide the documentation to which Ellis had referred, demanding that cops get a search warrant. The warrant was granted and executed the same day. During the search, investigators were given access to “notes” written by McClendon and Counts that documented the incident, according to the affidavit. In emails between all five that were reviewed by police, “it was made very clear that a sexual assault had occurred, and the school had a duty to report,” the affidavit continues, noting that “there were multiple emails exchanged,” and that “several of the administrators refused to report the incident.” The five were arrested Wednesday and released on $5,000 bond. It is still unclear whether they have retained lawyers to speak on their behalf. On Thursday, police arrested a student involved in the alleged attack, authorities announced. No further details have been released, and the student, who is a juvenile, has not been identified. “Our school officials have, and will continue to, cooperate with law enforcement and their investigation,” the president of Midland Christian’s board of trustees told the Reporter-Telegram in a statement. “Currently, we have qualified acting administrators to supervise the campus, oversee student activities, support faculty, and maintain the day-to-day operation of the school. The physical, spiritual, and emotional safety of our students is the most important responsibility we bear as educators and one we take seriously. We appreciate the support and prayers of our Midland Christian parents, faculty, staff, and students as we continue leading, building, and equipping for Christ.” The allegations in the Midland Christian case are disturbingly similar to those laid out in a 2020 civil suit filed by a student at a public school in the Midland suburb of Greenville. Administrators there stand accused of covering up repeated sexual assaults of a student athlete by his teammates, according to court filings reviewed by The Daily Beast, which say the school not only tried to sweep the alleged assaults under the rug, but that it retaliated by “discontinuing a longstanding business relationship” with the victim’s father. The lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial in September. Read more at The Daily Beast. Got a tip?

2/18/2022,"Nearly half of bald and golden eagles in the US have chronic lead poisoning, a new study found. Eagles scavenge the remains of hunted animals, which carry lead fragments from bullets. Lead poisoning threatens to slow their population growth. It's a common pattern during hunting season in the winter: Hunters shoot elk or deer, then eagles scavenge the waste. That scavenged meal may have deadly consequences for eagles, according to a study published Thursday in the journal Science. The researchers detected high rates of lead poisoning among the two most common types of eagles in the US, bald eagles and golden eagles, from 2010 to 2018. Their findings suggest that eagles are ingesting lead fragments from bullets in animal carcasses left behind by hunters. ""Every single time a lead bullet hits a deer, it fragments into many, many pieces,"" Todd Katzner, a research wildlife biologist at the US Geological Survey and co-author of the study, told Insider. ""It only takes a tiny fragment, something the size of the head of a pin, to kill an eagle."" The researchers examined the blood, bone, liver, and feathers of more than 1,200 eagles across 38 US states. Of that sample, 47% of bald eagles and 46% of golden eagles had signs of chronic lead poisoning. Birds with chronic or repeated exposure to lead can develop lesions, weakness while flying, or convulsions and paralysis. What's more, lead poisoning threatens to stymie the growth of eagle species. The researchers estimated that lead poisoning slowed the annual population growth of bald eagles by 4% and golden eagles by 1%. ""Over a 20-year period, you're talking about thousands and thousands and thousands of [eagles] that are being removed from the population,"" Katzner said. Neither golden eagles nor bald eagles are endangered species. The US bald eagle population has more than quadrupled since 2009, from around 72,000 to 317,000 birds. But the US golden eagle population is still relatively small — around 30,000 birds — and at risk of declining. ""The role of that lead is probably greater for these golden eagle populations, just because these populations are so much smaller and they're in a more precarious situation,"" Katzner said. Scientists have known about lead exposure in eagles for several decades. ""Every so often, eagles end up in a rehabilitation facility. They're sick and they get X-rayed and you can see fragments of lead in their digestive tract,"" Katzner said. But until Thursday's study, researchers hadn't been able to quantify how dangerous or widespread lead exposure was among US eagles. ""We got samples from Alaska down to Florida, from Maine to California, so we really had this wide sample size that is reflective of this nationwide pattern that we're seeing in these birds,"" Vince Slabe, a research wildlife biologist at the nonprofit Conservation Science Global and a co-author of the study, told Insider. Adult eagles had higher rates of chronic lead poisoning than younger eagles, Slabe said, since they had more opportunities to be exposed over their lifetimes. But several eagles also suffered from acute poisoning — meaning they may have had a brief exposure to high levels of lead. The researchers didn't track whether these birds survived, but some eagles with acute lead poisoning suffer quick deaths, sometimes before developing symptoms. Acute poisoning was more common in winter, when eagle species had less access to their standard food sources, such as fish, rabbits, and squirrels. ""In the winter season, these animals become less abundant for both [eagle] species and their feeding habits change,"" Slabe said, adding, ""They start scavenging a lot more."" Up to 33% of bald eagles and up to 35% of golden eagles in the study showed signs of acute lead poisoning. The researchers also ruled out the possibility that eagles had been exposed by getting shot themselves. ""A small number of the eagles in this study were shot, but in the cases where that shooting occurred, we never took samples from any tissue that could have been exposed,"" Katzner said. Slabe said he expects lots of hunters to ""willingly switch from lead to non-lead"" bullets ""once they find out they're potentially poisoning animals."" The California Department of Fish and Wildlife already requires hunters to use non-lead ammunition, such as copper bullets. The New York Department of Environmental Conservation and Alaska Department of Health and Social Services advise hunters to do the same.

2/18/2022,"By Dmitry Antonov and Pavel Polityuk MOSCOW/KYIV (Reuters) - Shelling in Ukraine on Thursday renewed Western fears of an imminent Russian invasion as U.S. President Joe Biden said Moscow is preparing a pretext to justify a possible attack and the Kremlin expelled an American diplomat. Early morning exchanges of fire between Kyiv's forces and pro-Russian separatists - who have been at war for years and where a ceasefire is periodically violated - caused alarm as Western countries have said an incursion could come at any time. One of the deepest crises in post-Cold War relations is playing out in Europe as Russia wants security guarantees, including Kyiv never joining NATO, and the U.S. and allies offer arms control and confidence-building measures. While Russia accuses the West of hysteria, saying some its troops have returned to bases and that it has no plans to invade, many Western countries are adamant that the military build-up is continuing ahead of a possible assault. ""We have reason to believe they are engaged in a false flag operation to have an excuse to go in,"" Biden told reporters at the White House. ""Every indication we have is they're prepared to go into Ukraine and attack Ukraine."" He ordered Secretary of State Antony Blinken to change his travel plans at the last minute to speak at a United Nations Security Council meeting, where he outlined possible Russian scenarios. ""It could be a fabricated so-called terrorist bombing inside Russia, the invented discovery of a mass grave, a staged drone strike against civilians, or a fake - even a real - attack using chemical weapons,"" Blinken said. ""Russia may describe this event as ethnic cleansing, or a genocide."" Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Vershinin said Blinken's comments were regrettable and dangerous. In a new blow to relations between the two world powers, Russia expelled U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission Bart Gorman. The move was announced on Thursday but a senior State Department official said he left last week. Moscow cited the U.S. expulsion of a senior official in Washington, who it said was forced to leave before a replacement could be found as part of a U.S. ""visa war"". Washington said it would respond to the ""unprovoked"" move. Russian diplomats who have stayed longer than three years must leave the United States, while Moscow is giving U.S. diplomats less time, a State Department spokesperson said. TRADING ACCUSATIONS In Ukraine, Russian-backed rebels and Kyiv's forces traded accusations that each had fired across the ceasefire line in eastern Ukraine, where Moscow accuses Kyiv of ""exterminating"" civilians. Ukrainian government forces denied accusations of having targeted separatist positions in the breakaway region of Donbass, which borders Russia. Details could not be established independently, but reports from both sides suggested an incident more serious than the routine ceasefire violations that are often reported in the area. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was ""seriously concerned"" about the reports. Russia has long said Kyiv wants an excuse to seize rebel territory by force, which Ukraine denies. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the pro-Russian forces had shelled a kindergarten, in what he called a ""big provocation"". Video footage released by Ukrainian police showed a hole through a brick wall in a room scattered with debris and children's toys. ""Some provocations were planned for today, we expected them and thought that a war had begun,"" Dmytro, a resident of the village of Stanytsia Luhanska, told Reuters. The separatists, for their part, accused government forces of opening fire on their territory four times in the past 24 hours. Neither account could be verified. A Reuters photographer in the town of Kadiivka, in Ukraine's rebel-held Luhansk region, heard the sound of some artillery fire from the direction of the line of contact, but was not able to determine details. SUMMIT OF KEY LEADERS? Estimates also vary as to how many Russia soldiers have massed near Ukraine. Nearby NATO member Estonia cited around 170,000 troops on Wednesday. White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said on Thursday that Russia had added 7,000 troops to its presence at the Ukrainian border over the past 24 hours. ""We see them fly in more combat and support aircraft. We see them sharpen their readiness in the Black Sea,"" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said at NATO headquarters in Brussels. ""We even see them stocking up their blood supplies."" Russia's defence ministry released video it said showed more units leaving the area near the border. Maxar Technologies, a private U.S. company that has been tracking the build-up, said satellite images showed that, while Russia has pulled back some military equipment from near Ukraine, other hardware has arrived. As diplomatic efforts continue, Russia says its security demands are still being ignored. ""In the absence of the readiness of the American side to agree on firm, legally binding guarantees of our security from the United States and its allies, Russia will be forced to respond, including through the implementation of military-technical measures,"" it said in a letter to the U.S. ambassador. Blinken said Washington was evaluating the document and that he had earlier sent a letter to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov proposing a meeting between the pair in Europe as well as of the NATO Russia Council and the OSCE permanent Council. ""These meetings can pave the way for a summit of key leaders,"" he said.

2/18/2022,"By Robin Emmott BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Estonia's prime minister said on Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin is enjoying the international attention generated by Russia's massive military drills on Ukraine's borders and is looking for a successful war to lift support at home. Speaking to Reuters, Kaja Kallas also said the situation was extremely grave and that Moscow must not be given any kind of concessions as long as it maintained more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine. It would be a negotiation at gunpoint, she said. ""I think he is clearly enjoying himself, being at the centre of attention in the West, because there were years when he was maybe somewhat overlooked,"" Kallas said before a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels to discuss the crisis. ""But now, with the different Western leaders visiting him, everybody constantly speculating what he's thinking or what he might do ... this is making him definitely very important,"" she said of the man who has dominated Russia since 2000. Putin's separate meetings with the French and German leaders at a glistening table six meters (20 ft) long have been broadcast around the world. On Wednesday, Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro flew to Moscow for talks with Putin, and he has had several telephone calls with U.S. President Joe Biden. The Kremlin has denied any plan to invade Ukraine and says troop movements within its own borders and demands for security guarantees from the United States and NATO are legitimate responses to Western aggression. Kallas mused that the Russian troop build-up could be, in part, designed as a distraction from domestic pressures. Putin has come under scrutiny at home over Moscow's handling of the pandemic with more than 700,000 COVID-19 deaths in Russia, according to Reuters calculations based on state statistics, and only half the population vaccinated. ""When the popularity goes down, then you need a successful war to boost the support. So that is also something that Russia or Russian administration has used before,"" Kallas said. ""So I think these things are definitely related."" Moscow has sought guarantees that Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, never be allowed to join NATO, a demand which has been rejected by the alliance as running counter to a country's freedom of choice, although it has said membership is a distant prospect. Kallas said Putin was trying to reassert Russia as a global power, noting that he saw the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991 as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the last century. ""The only one who can de-escalate is Russia. Russia has created this situation and can also take a step back,"" she said. ""I'm very cautious of any kind of negotiations, of offering Russia something because we shouldn't forget the big picture, which is that the gun is pointed at Ukraine really and you can't have negotiations at gunpoint,"" she said.
