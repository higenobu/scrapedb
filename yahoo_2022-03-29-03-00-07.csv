3/29/2022,"A husband sprinted after his wife as she plunged to her death off a Utah cliff, police said. Candice Thompson, a 26-year-old from Richfield, Utah, fell between 75 and 100 feet on Sunday, March 27, off a cliff locals call the “Bulls Head,” Sevier County Sheriff’s Office said. “At the time her husband was with her and called 911 while running to try to get to her,” deputies said on Facebook. First responders rushed to help Thompson. They transported her to an ambulance that was waiting, and she was taken to a hospital for emergency care. A helicopter was also on scene, but Thompson’s vitals weren’t stable enough to be flown, according to the sheriff’s office. “Despite the efforts of the first responders and hospital they were not able to overcome the significant injuries sustained in the fall and impact,” deputies said. No foul play is suspected, but the sheriff’s office is investigating the incident. Deputies believe the fall was an accident.

3/29/2022,"A former US ambassador to Russia has said recent comments by a senior Moscow politician about launching nuclear war are ""nothing new"" and signalled the Kremlin is no closer to launching a strike than before its invasion of Ukraine. Dmitry Medvedev, the ex-Russian prime minister and president who is now deputy chairman of the country's security council, warned this weekend that Russia could turn to its nuclear arsenal against a country which used conventional weapons. Medvedev told the Guardian that Russia's nuclear doctrine would not require an enemy state to fire first and listed four scenarios in which Russia would launch their nuclear arsenal: If Russia was struck by a nuclear missile. If any other nuclear weapons were used against Russia or its allies. An attack on ""critical infrastructure"" which paralyses its nuclear deterrents. If an act of aggression is committed against Russia and its allies that jeopardises the existence of the country itself. Medvedev's words were the latest nuclear warnings coming out of Moscow after Vladimir Putin placed Russia's nuclear forces on ""high alert"" following the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. On Tuesday, Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, refused to rule out the use of nuclear weapons if they were faced with an ""existential threat"". And, on Thursday, Russia upped the rhetoric again, with Dmitry Polyanskiy, the Russian deputy ambassador to the UN, warning Moscow reserved the right to deploy nuclear weapons if ""provoked"". However, the former US ambassador, Michael McFaul, said that the threats of nuclear weapons are ""nothing new"", and stated that ""none"" of the four conditions outlined by Medvedev were remotely likely. McFaul tweeted: ""None of these conditions are present or even being threatened. None will occur. NATO will never attack Russia preemptively, let alone jeopardize the existence of Russia. Never. ""Note, he did not say 'If NATO supplies fighter jets to Ukraine.' ""Note, he did not say 'if Russia begins to lose on the battlefield in Ukraine' ""In fact, compared to Russian doctrine before the invasion of Ukraine, I see nothing new at all in what Medvedev said regarding the conditions under which Russia would use nuclear weapons. What am I missing? Watch: Ukraine warns of Mariupol's desperate plight ahead of peace talks  ""And as for actions, I have seen no evidence that Russian nuclear forces are on a higher alert now than before invading Ukraine. Correct me if I am wrong."" McFaul, who sat across from Putin regularly in negotiations, has previously said it would be a mistake to dismiss the president's comments on nuclear arms. In February, shortly after the invasion was launched, he described Putin as ""increasingly unhinged"", adding: ""The people who know Putin the best — people I know in Russia — are worried about his recent nuclear statement. The people who know him the least are saying it's cheap talk."" Ukraine and Russia are set to engage in the first face-to-face peace talks in more than two weeks on Tuesday, with the state of Putin’s mind - and whether he is willing to agree on any compromise - still open to question. Officials in Kyiv have recently suggested Moscow could be more willing to compromise having seen stiff Ukrainian resistance and heavy Russian losses. But a senior U.S. State Department official said Putin did not give that impression. ""Everything I have seen is he is not willing to compromise at this point,"" the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity after Ukraine's president sketched out a potential way to end the crisis over the weekend. The Kremlin, for its part, has said it was alarmed by U.S. President Joe Biden's comment during a speech on Saturday that Putin must not remain in power. But the fact they are taking place in person at all - for the first time since an acrimonious meeting between foreign ministers on March 10 - was a sign of shifts behind the scenes as Russia's invasion has become bogged down. Russia is now in the second month of its invasion of Ukraine, having failed to gain a single significant city. On the ground, there has been no sign of respite for civilians in besieged cities, especially the devastated port of Mariupol, whose mayor said 160,000 people were still trapped inside and Russia was blocking attempts to evacuate them. But the mayor of Irpin, near Kyiv, said Ukrainian forces had seized back full control of the town. Ukrainian authorities have claimed between 10-15,000 Russian troops have been killed in Ukraine - which if true would be the highest toll since the Second World War. While the number has not been independently verified, a Nato source put the numbers of Russian soldiers killed at between 7,000 and 15,000 to take Ukraine and insisted the Russian offensive is going to plan.On Tuesday Putin's spokesman denied the Kremlin ever thought it would need “a couple of days”.",News/Yahoo News UK,Russia outlines four reasons it would use nuclear weapons,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-outlines-4-reasons-it-would-use-nuclear-weapons-160825581.html
3/29/2022,"ALMATY (Reuters) - A Kazakh radio station fired one of its presenters on Monday after she said ""we will call in Uncle Vova if you talk too much"" in a heated Facebook debate, a reference to Russian President Vladimir Putin and the idea that Russia could invade. Kazakhstan, a former Soviet republic, shares the world's second-longest land border with Russia and has close economic and political ties with Moscow, being a member of Russian-led trade and military blocs. It has a large ethnic Russian population and the war in Ukraine has sparked heated online debates between supporters of both sides. After a public outcry, the Europa Plus Kazakhstan radio station distanced itself from host Lyubov Panova's Facebook comments and then, on Monday, said that her contract had been terminated. Panova did not immediately reply to a request for comment. ""Vova"" is an affectionate diminutive of ""Vladimir"" and Panova made the comment in response to another Facebook user's criticism of support for Russia and Putin. Deputy Prosecutor General Bulat Dembayev issued a statement warning social media users against making comments that call for Kazakhs to join the Russia-Ukraine conflict or incite ethnic hatred. ""Moreover, some social network users, including Kazakh citizens ... publish separatist slogans that refer to the territorial integrity of our country,"" he said, warning that such actions constitute a crime. Kazakhstan has avoided criticising Russia's invasion of Ukraine, although President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said this month that all countries must strictly adhere to the norms and principles of the UN Charter. And the deputy foreign minister told a German newspaper that companies leaving Russia due to the war in Ukraine were welcome to move production to Kazakhstan, saying Kazakhstan would not want to be on the wrong side of a new ""iron curtain"". Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbour. Kyiv and the West consider this a pretext for an unprovoked invasion.

3/29/2022,"SpaceX will stop producing new Crew Dragon craft after it finishes manufacturing its fourth and final capsule, according to Reuters. After confirming the news, Elon Musk’s private space firm told the outlet it would continue to produce components for the spacecraft and that it would retain its capacity to manufacture additional Crew Dragon capsules should something come up. Given the reusable nature of the Crew Dragon, it was always assumed SpaceX would produce a limited number of the spacecraft, but before today it wasn’t known just how many capsules the company planned to make before moving on to other projects. Since its first crewed flight in 2020, Crew Dragon has flown five crews to space, including the first-ever all-civilian one at the end of last year. As part of its ongoing Commercial Crew program, NASA had planned to use the Space X capsule to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station across six separate missions, but recently said it would use the craft for as many as three more flights due to delays associated with Boeing’s Starliner craft. The end of Crew Dragon manufacturing comes as SpaceX looks to get its next-generation Starship reusable heavy rocket certified and operational. The spacecraft is a key piece in all of SpaceX’s plans involving the Moon and Mars. After a handful of delays, Elon Musk recently said the company hoped to conduct Starship’s first orbital test in May.",Business/Engadget,SpaceX is ending Crew Dragon production,https://news.yahoo.com/spacex-ends-crew-dragon-production-171430309.html
