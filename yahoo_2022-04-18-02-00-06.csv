4/18/2022,"Millions who left the labor force last year don't plan to return to work, shops, or eating out. Women, those without a college degree, and people in low-paying sectors are least likely to return. A worker shortage will likely put more pressure on wages and prices even as the Fed increases rates. Millions of Americans who left the workforce last year plan to stay away indefinitely, signaling a trend of ""long social distancing,"" which is likely to affect White House and Federal Reserve policy. The number of those who have dropped out of the workforce and shunned in-person work, shopping, or eating out is estimated to be around three million. Their stance is partly due to persistent fears around the pandemic, according to research by Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University, José María Barrero of Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México, and Steven J. Davis of the University of Chicago. The dropouts were most likely to be women, those lacking a college degree, and people working in low-paid sectors, the researchers said. A quarter of those unwilling to return to pre-pandemic activities cited pandemic fears as a primary or secondary factor. The study, which surveyed the opinions of 5,000 people over 12 months, consistently found at least 10% of respondents had no intention of returning to the labor force, particularly if required to do so in-person, or other pre-pandemic activities. ""Our evidence is the labor force isn't going to magically bounce back,"" Bloom told The Wall Street Journal. He added: ""We still don't see any change in these 'long social distancing' numbers, which suggests this drop in labor-force participation may be quite enduring."" The suggestion that millions are opting out of the in-person economy as COVID-19 restrictions subside could put more pressure on the labor market and accelerate US plans to quell demand. Inflation reached a four-decade high 8.5% in March. Even if some inflationary pressures ease, workers might ask for a raise to cope with rising costs, potentially invoking a wage-price spiral that could make high price rises endemic. The Federal Reserve Monetary Committee has signaled six rate hikes this year in addition to the two already delivered, driven by fears of an overheating economy. An additional 431,000 jobs being added last month gave cause for optimism that hiring was picking up pace, after US unemployment peaked above 23 million during the pandemic. It was most recently close to pre-pandemic levels below 6 million. But these findings suggest the labor market will remain tight, putting upward pressure on wages and prices even as interest rates rise. The team behind the study estimates the US workforce is still ""missing"" about 3.5 million workers – that is, the number of people that would have made up the labor force if the economy had continued to expand at its pre-pandemic pace. Joe Biden's COVID-19 Preparedness Plan, released last month, said the US president was working with lawmakers to provide paid leave to those who had to take time off after contracting the virus. The aim is to provide economic security to workers currently in the labor force.

4/18/2022,"Nasa must be stopped from revealing Earth’s location to dangerous aliens, an Oxford scientist has warned. The US space agency has proposed broadcasting a message, dubbed the “Beacon in the Galaxy”, intended to greet extraterrestrial intelligences. It is an updated form of the Arecibo message, broadcast in 1974 for the same purpose. Improvements in digital technology mean that more information can now be broadcast. The proposed new message includes basic mathematical and physical concepts to establish a universal means of communication, followed by information on the biochemical composition of life on Earth. It also includes the solar system’s location relative to major clusters of stars, along with digitised depictions of the solar system itself, Earth’s surface, and male and female humans. The message concludes with an invitation for intelligences to respond. But Anders Sandberg, a senior research fellow at Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute (FHI), warned that sharing such information with intelligent life presents a risk that must be considered. Dr Sandberg told The Telegraph that, although the chance of the message reaching an alien civilisation was low, “it has such a high impact that you actually need to take it rather seriously.” He said that the “giggle factor” surrounding the search for extraterrestrial intelligence meant that “many people just refuse to take anything related to it seriously. Which is a shame, because this is important stuff.” Overall, said Dr Sandberg, both the risk and the potential benefit were small. Given the difficulty of traversing vast spans of interstellar space, a message received even by a very advanced civilisation might amount to little beyond, as Dr Sandberg put it, “a postcard saying, ‘Wish you were here,’”. The Arecibo message is one of several broadcasts, including some advertisements, already sent by humans into space. “The poor aliens might already be getting various messages sent for all sorts of reasons,” said Dr Sandberg. A better approach than individual groups firing off ad-hoc missives, Dr Sandberg suggested, would be humanity coordinating as a species. “We’re not great at coordinating, but I think it is a nice exercise,” he said. Toby Ord, Dr Sandberg’s colleague at the FHI, made similar arguments in The Precipice, a book published in 2020 in which he analysed existential risks facing humanity. Dr Ord suggested that it might be wise to have “public discussion” before sending messages to aliens, pointing out that “even passive SETI (listening for their messages) could hold dangers, as the message could be designed to entrap us. “These dangers are small, but poorly understood and not yet well managed.” Overall, wrote Dr Ord, “the main relevant question is the ratio of peaceful to hostile civilisations. We have very little evidence about whether this is high or low, and there is no scientific consensus. Given the downside could be much bigger than the upside, this doesn’t sound to me like a good situation in which to take active steps toward contact.” The Nasa scientists proposed that the message be broadcast from FAST (China’s Five-hundred-metre Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope) and the SETI Institute’s Allen Telescope Array in northern California. No date has been offered for the broadcast. Scientists including Stephen Hawking have, in the past, warned that these messages could be risky. In a documentary released in 2010, Professor Hawking pointed out that, on Earth, interactions between civilisations on different levels of technological advancement tend not to work out very well for the lesser-advanced group. “We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn’t want to meet,” Professor Hawking said, citing the arrival of Europeans in the Americas.",Science/The Telegraph,"Stop revealing Earth’s location to dangerous aliens, Nasa warned",https://news.yahoo.com/stop-revealing-earth-location-dangerous-140354546.html
4/18/2022,"When a Florida woman noticed fraudulent activity on her bank account, she began investigating on her own, and was able to track him to a gas station. Then she called the police. The woman first noticed the charges on Wednesday coming from a Wawa gas station, Stuart police said in a Facebook post. She was able to find out that a man driving a white work truck had made the charges, police said. They didn’t say how she got this information. The woman thought that perhaps the man was a creature of habit and would return to the scene of the crime. So she went to the gas station on Thursday and waited. A white work truck pulled up and began pumping gas, police said. She saw the man toss credit cards in the trash at the same time, she was receiving fraudulent alerts from her bank. Read: Hot and muggy Saturday, with increasing chances of rain on Easter That was when she called 911. A Stuart police sergeant came to the gas station and talked to the man, who is from Fort Lauderdale. Detectives later found multiple steel tanks in the back of the truck and other tanks hidden in the bed of the truck, the report said. They also found 28 fraudulent credit and debit cards in the truck.
