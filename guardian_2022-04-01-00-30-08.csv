4/1/2022,"When Russia played Saudi Arabia in the opening match of the last World Cup, Gianni Infantino wasn’t the only dignitary in the crowd. As Russia opened the scoring, the cameras cut to the corporate seats, where the Fifa president could be seen sharing a funny joke with the matchday buddies sitting either side of him, Vladimir Putin and Sheikh Mohammed bin Salman. Of course, this was back in the days before the Saudi crown prince was discovered to have ordered his hit squad to play fast and loose with a bonesaw, or the Russian president had declared outright war on Ukraine. On that particular summer’s evening in Moscow, they were just a pair of common-or-garden tyrants kicking back and enjoying the craic, brought together by their good pal Gianni. But despite subsequently accepting a medal of friendship from Putin, Infantino has now been forced to concede that, despite his high hopes, staging the World Cup in Russia had not invoked the warm fuzziness he’d hoped in the Russian president. Speaking at the 72nd Fifa congress, staged in Qatar before Friday’s Human Rights World Cup draw, Infantino insisted that while Russia 2018 had been “a great success”, sadly “it did not solve the problems of the world”. Not only that, “it did not create a lasting peace”, he parped. “Therefore my plea, to all of those who have some power in this world, to all of those who are in important political positions in the world – please, please stop conflicts and wars. Please, for our children, for our future.” But while football may have come up short when it came to stopping conflict, Infantino remains confident it can still play an important role. Asked about the legacy of Russia 2018, he sidestepped the question with a rambling answer that invoked the legacy of two fabled leaders. “If you look at the last century, who are the people who made the most impact?” he enquired rhetorically. “Mandela and Gandhi. They had many reasons to be violent. They went another route. I think football can be like that … create understanding.” This year, football will be attempting to create understanding in Qatar, where human rights abuses remain rife and more than 6,500 migrant workers are reported to have died since the country started whipping itself into shape for the big kickabout. On that theme, Norwegian FA president Lise Klaveness delivered a stinging address. “Football can inspire dreams and break down barriers but as leaders we must do it right, to the highest standards,” she said. “In 2010, World Cups were awarded by Fifa in unacceptable ways with unacceptable consequences. Human rights, equality, democracy: the core interests of football were not in the starting XI until many years later. Fifa has addressed these issues but there’s still a long way to go. The migrant workers injured, the families of those that died in the buildup to the World Cup must be cared for.” Having been more or less told to sit down and shut up by a more Fifa-approved Honduran delegate, Klaveness was later criticised by Hassan al-Thawadi, Qatar 2022 secretary general, who described her views as “outdated”.

4/1/2022,"The Biden administration is commemorating International Transgender Day of Visibility with new policy actions to support trans communities facing a wave of discriminative legislation at the state level. The newly announced measures will include policies aimed at improving mental health among trans children, helping trans people gain easier access to government services, and providing additional gender identification options at the airport. “Transgender people are some of the bravest Americans I know, and our Nation and the world are stronger, more vibrant, and more prosperous because of them. To transgender Americans of all ages, I want you to know that you are so brave. You belong. I have your back,” wrote Biden in his proclamation of the day on Wednesday. Specifically, the Biden administration will announce that starting 11 April, travelers will be able to select “X” when identifying their gender on their passport, providing more options besides “female” and “male.” Biden is also expected to partner with airlines, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to add the gender marker “X” into their systems, reports CNN. Several government agencies, such as the Social Security Administration (SSA) and Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), will make it easier for recipients to change their gender information. Starting later this year, the SSA will no longer require proof of identity or a doctor’s note to update gender information, with other federal agencies allowing people to self-identify their gender identity. New materials on the challenges trans children may face in school will be released by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and the Department of Education. This year’s celebration of trans visibility comes after a recent onslaught of anti-trans legislation passed or proposed in recent months. The Iowa governor, Kim Reynolds, signed a bill earlier this month that barred trans girls and women from participating in high school and college athletics, despite arguments that the bill was discriminatory and targeted a non-existent problem. Texas governor Greg Abbott instructed the state’s child protection services to investigate any parents providing their children with gender-affirming care, calling it “child abuse”. “Transgender Americans continue to face discrimination, harassment, and barriers to opportunity,” wrote Biden. “In the past year, hundreds of anti-transgender bills in States were proposed across America, most of them targeting transgender kids. The onslaught has continued this year. These bills are wrong.” Additionally, “Jeopardy!” champion Amy Schneider, the first openly trans winner on the game show, will meet with second gentleman Doug Emhoff on Thursday. Schneider had the second longest winning streak in “Jeopardy!” history. Emhoff, along with Assistant Secretary for Health Rachel Levine, one of the few openly transgender government officials, will also meet with trans kids and their parents at the White House. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona will travel to Florida to discuss the state’s newly passed “Don’t Say Gay” bill with LGBTQ+ students. The legislation bars discussion of LGBTQ+ topics in kindergarten through third grade classrooms.",News/Society,Biden announces new measures to support transgender people amid wave of discrimination,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/31/biden-measures-to-support-transgender-people
4/1/2022,"“There’s a lot you can say about the modern Republican party – it’s paranoid, authoritarian, obsessed with conspiracy theories and culture wars,” said Seth Meyers on Wednesday’s Late Night. “But in addition to that, it’s also full of weird people constantly saying weird shit.” Meyers pointed to the most recent example: Madison Cawthorn, the 26-year-old congressman from North Carolina, “who said something so bizarre the other day that even a Republican senator from his own state said Cawthorn clearly has been an embarrassment at times”. In an interview with a podcast, Warrior Poet Society, posted online last week, Cawthorn, a controversialist and Trump supporter, talked about the “sexual perversion in Washington” and said his colleagues he had respected hosted orgies full of cocaine. “Come on, man, you really expect us to believe that Congress could plan and execute an orgy?” Meyers mused. “At best I could see them announcing an exploratory committee that would begin to investigate the feasibility of an orgy at a later date.” “I gotta say, if they were having orgies and doing cocaine, I would actually find that impressive,” he added. “I mean, they’re all 70 or 80 years old.” Cawthorn “seems to be accusing his own GOP colleagues of being sex-crazed drug addicts”, Meyers explained, “which is why, understandably, those same colleagues are pissed at him now”. The House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, called Cawthorn in for a one-on-one meeting, after which he told reporters Cawthorn’s comments were “unacceptable”. “This is truly an amazing turn in the evolution of the Republican party,” Meyers noted. “They whipped up their base into believing crazy shit. That base then elected a bunch of crazy people who believe that crazy shit, and now those crazy people are accusing their fellow Republicans of engaging in wild drug-fueled sex parties.” Five weeks into its “unlawful and brutal invasion of Ukraine”, Russian forces “still cannot overcome Ukraine’s fierce resistance”, said Stephen Colbert on Wednesday’s Late Show. “Also, Russia’s basic incompetence. Their ground forces are, and I don’t want to get too technical here, a bucket of hot doo-doo.” Russian troops, low on supplies, have even taken to camouflaging their tanks with swaths of carpeting. “Now, I’m no military expert, but I believe if you want to camouflage a tank, maybe disguise it as something that moves,” quipped. Colbert also checked in on a noted Putin supporter: Donald Trump, who did an interview on Tuesday with the Just the News television show on the Real America’s Voice network. “The rightwing news outlets that our former president has been reduced to appearing on sound like they were named with magnetic poetry,” Colbert observed, mimicking a Trump staffer: “OK, sir, your next interview is going to be with Eagle Freedom Truth Gun Muscle Gazette. Quality people over there.” During the “interview”, the former president called on Putin to release dirt on Hunter Biden, harkening back to the debunked conspiracy theory which led to his first impeachment as president in 2019. “Damn, he’s asking for Russian help through the TV again?” Colbert wondered. “Does this man have no shame? And I withdraw the question. “As usual his timing is impeccable,” he added. “He reminded the world that Putin is his buddy at the exact moment that everyone realizes his buddy is actual Hitler. This is worse than last year, when Jell-O re-signed Bill Cosby to announce their new flavor, ‘Out on a Technicality Orange.’” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel started the night off with what remains the top story in Hollywood: the Oscars slap. “It is turning out to be this generation’s version of the moon landing,” he said. “Was it a crime? Was it staged? Was it the end of comedy? Was it cake? We don’t know.” On Tuesday, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, which hosts the Oscars, announced an official inquiry into the incident. “You have to remember, it takes these people four hours to hand out eight awards,” said Kimmel, who hosted the ceremony in 2018. “So they’re in no rush. They do one thing a year, and that’s it.” “Now the question is, what are they going to do? Are they going to suspend Will Smith’s membership? Maybe even take his Oscar away? I don’t think they should do either of those things,” Kimmel continued. “If the Academy wants to punish Will Smith, you know what they should do? They should make him host the red carpet interviews for E! next year. “We’re all feeling the repercussions of this slap,” he added. “My jaw hurts just from telling so many jokes about it.”",Arts/Culture,Seth Meyers: ‘You really expect us to believe Congress could plan an orgy?’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/31/seth-meyers-republican-party-late-night-tv
4/1/2022,"The families of 21 seriously ill Ukrainian children, who were airlifted to the UK amid much government fanfare, fear they may never see them again due to delays in visa processing. The children flown to the UK have cancer and some are receiving end-of-life care. For others the prognosis is more encouraging. Of the 21 families brought here 18 are one mother and one child. Many of the families arebeing accommodated in hotels, which are difficult places to live in when parents are spending long periods by their children’s hospital bedsides. The charity Refugee Action, which is supporting some of the children and their families, has condemned their treatment by the UK government. Charity workers say these families should be granted automatic refugee resettlement which provides permanent accommodation along with support and leave to remain in the UK. The families do not have automatic family reunion rights, even though they have left parts of their immediate families behind in Ukraine, including siblings of the sick children. They will be expected to fill out two application forms in order to secure the right to stay in the UK for three years and bring over other family members. The children are being cared for in six NHS hospitals in England which specialise in paediatric cancers after being airlifted here on 13 March in a joint operation between the prime minister’s office, Department of Health and Social Care and the Home Office. The UK government had responded to a call for assistance from the Polish government to help look after some of the sick children who were being cared for by Polish health professionals. The UK partnered with St Jude’s children’s Research Hospital, a non-profit American organisation which specialises in paediatric diseases, to bring the children over. At the time the scheme was announced the prime minister said: “The sickening suffering of innocent civilians in Ukraine is truly horrific. This vital lifesaving medical care is another important step in our support for the people of Ukraine and their resistance against Putin’s illegal invasion.” Lou Calvey, the head of services and safeguarding at Refugee Action, said: “These families were confronting their worst fears even before the Ukrainian conflict began. It is shameful that the government has spent time issuing press releases trumpeting the arrival of these children instead of finding ways to support them to be together in their darkest hours. “While we welcome the government providing medical support to these families, we remain shocked as to why some of them have remained separated due to visa restrictions. The cruelty of this ‘computer says no’ approach has never been more clear. “We are calling on the government to do the decent thing by automatically giving these families the same three-years leave as those arriving via the Homes for Ukraine scheme and to bring over their close family members as a matter of absolute urgency. “These children and families are the most vulnerable. Some families are juggling care of their sick child with care for other children who are here with them. Other parents are desperate to bring over siblings and other family members left behind in Ukraine. “All the children are exceptionally unwell and their families are traumatised. We have seriously let these families down.” Following the announcement of the airlift the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said: “I am proud that the UK is offering lifesaving medical care to these Ukrainian children, who have been forced out of their home country by the Russian invasion while undergoing medical treatment. I know that the incredible staff in the NHS will ensure they get the best possible care.” The Home Office has been approached for comment.",News/World news,Ukrainian children with cancer airlifted to UK remain split from families ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/ukrainian-children-with-cancer-airlifted-to-uk-remain-split-from-families
4/1/2022,"With Covid infection levels at a record high in parts of the UK, the virus is rife once more, with experts noting one factor is the rise of a variant of Omicron known as BA.2. But what does this mean for reinfections? Yes. According to the latest weekly Influenza and Covid-19 surveillance report from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), since the beginning of the pandemic to 20 March this year 804,463 possible reinfection episodes have been identified in England – defined as two positive tests more than 90 days apart – with 50,866 of those identified in figures for the most recent week. The agency adds that, so far, 8,717 third episodes and 74 fourth episodes have been identified since the start of the pandemic. However, as not everyone with Covid takes a test, the figures are likely to be an undercount. The UKHSA data also shows that while reinfections did occur at low levels earlier in the pandemic, the rate of reinfection shot up towards the end of 2021, before falling and, more recently, rising once more. While a Covid infection will offer some protection against catching the virus again, this protection wanes over time. Data also suggests reinfection is higher in unvaccinated people, while the severity of the previous infection, and the level of immune response, may also play a role in the risk of reinfection. In addition, the more people who have had Covid, the greater the pool of individuals that could potentially be reinfected, and with infection levels high – and restrictions now eased – the chance of a susceptible person being exposed to Covid is raised. What’s more, the body’s immunity – whether from past infection or vaccination – may hold up better against some variants than others. These factors became particularly evident when Omicron reached in the UK towards the end of 2021, with the variant both highly transmissible and able to dodge the body’s immune responses to other variants or vaccination to a significant degree. “Reinfections are currently rapid and frequent, far more than previous waves,” said Prof Danny Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College London. “Partly [because of], the simple trilogy of transmissible variant, immune waning, [and] fewer precautions.” BA.2 is a variant of Omicron, with UKHSA data suggesting it is even more transmissible than the original Omicron variant, BA.1 – although the risk of hospitalisation appears to be no greater. BA.2 is currently the most common Covid variant across the UK. Altmann said BA.2 does not seem to show differences compared with BA.1 in its ability to evade the body’s immune responses. The point is highlighted by research from the US, with the authors noting the rise of BA.2 following the surge of BA.1 “is probably related to increased transmissibility rather than to enhanced immunologic escape”. While UKHSA data, as well as preliminary research from Denmark, suggests infection with BA.2 shortly after an infection with BA.1 is possible, it seems it is – at least for now – very rare, with the Danish research finding such reinfections were mostly in young, unvaccinated individuals. But both BA.1 and BA.2 are relatively new – and it takes time for reinfections to occur. “We are at the start of the 90-day period for possible reinfection with BA.2 following a BA.1 infection and there is a need for ongoing surveillance but there are no early indications of a specific reinfection issue with this scenario,” notes the latest UKHSA technical briefing on Covid variants. However Altmann, drawing on his own research, sounded a note of caution. “The surprising aspect is that, even say compared to expectations from common colds, Omicron seems so poorly immunogenic that it doesn’t even stimulate good immunity to itself – something that should be noted by all those thinking they may as well go out and get infected as a ‘natural booster’,” he said.",News/World news,Why are so many people in England getting reinfected with Covid?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/why-are-so-many-people-in-england-getting-reinfected-with-covid-omicron
4/1/2022,"Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney has addressed the vexing question of how the US copes with its ageing population, suggesting that retirement benefits may have to be cut for younger Americans. In comments to the Senate budget committee on Wednesday, the Republican senator from Utah said that the spiraling costs of retirement programs had to be tackled to bring national debt under control. Romney raised the politically controversial idea of cutting benefits, but only for younger generations before they reach retirement age. “For younger people coming along, we got to be able to find a way to balance these programs or we’re gonna find ourselves in a heap of trouble,” he said. He added that he was not in favour of raising taxes as a way of balancing the books, but was open to adjusting “long-term benefits not for current retirees”. Romney’s remarks, first reported by Business Insider, open a can of worms often avoided by members of Congress given its intense political sensitivities. The programs in question include two of the most popular benefits in the country – social security and Medicare, which make up more than 40% of government spending. The backdrop to the issue is America’s ageing population. By 2034 projections suggest there will be 77 million Americans aged 65 and older – more than the projected 76.5 million under 18s. That means that for the first time in US history older people will outnumber children. That same year, 2034, the trust fund for social security is expected to run out, leaving the US government struggling to make full benefit payments. That looming deadline is a reflection of the intense and rising pressure on social security and Medicare given long-term funding shortfalls. Conservatives have consistently tried to chip away at the programs. Most recently, House Republicans proposed raising the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 69 and social security from 67 to 69. But in his Build Back Better plan, Joe Biden sought to protect and even extend the programs, adding hearing coverage to Medicare. The bill passed the House but was stalled in the US Senate.",News/US news,Romney suggests cutting retirement benefits for younger Americans,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/31/mitt-romney-cut-back-retirement-benefits-younger-americans
4/1/2022,"Barcelona want to capitalise on the uncertainty at Chelsea by signing César Azpilicueta, Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rüdiger this summer. The La Liga club are rebuilding their squad amid a financially turbulent period and are aiming to strengthen their defence by signing the players who made up Thomas Tuchel’s back three when Chelsea beat Manchester City in last season’s Champions League final. Christensen is expected to move to the Camp Nou when his contract expires at the end of the season and it has now emerged that Barça, who remain interested in Azpilicueta despite a 12-month extension to his deal being triggered this week, have opened talks with Rüdiger’s representatives about signing the defender on a free. Their moves come at a time when Chelsea are unable to offer players new contracts while they wait for Roman Abramovich to sell the club. Chelsea were granted a licence to continue after sanctions were imposed on Abramovich and will be able to hand out new deals only after the club are sold, with a takeover not expected until at least the end of April. Chelsea have some leverage with Azpilicueta, whose clause was agreed before the sanctions came into effect, but Barça are still in for the Spain international. They have offered the Chelsea captain a two-year contract with the option for an extra year and could pay a small fee for the 32-year-old, who is interested in returning to Spain after 10 years in England. Christensen’s situation is thought to be more straightforward, with the Denmark international almost certain to leave after talks over a new deal broke down. However Rüdiger’s situation is less clear. He has made no decision over his future and could stay if Chelsea’s ownership issues are resolved soon. Rüdiger, who wants about £200,000 a week and a large signing-on fee, has been free to talk to foreign clubs since January and there has been no shortage of interest. Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus have been linked and eyebrows were raised when pictures emerged of Rüdiger’s brother and agent, Sahr Senesie, entering a hotel in Barcelona with Barça’s director of football, Mateu Alemany, and technical director, Jordi Cruyff. The situation will be of concern to Tuchel, who is likely to need at least one new centre-back.

4/1/2022,"Owen Farrell has suffered a setback on his continued comeback from ankle surgery after he was ruled out of Saracens’ trip to Sale on Friday with a head injury. Manu Tuilagi is, however, in line for a return having been named on the bench for the Sharks. Farrell made his first appearance since November last Saturday, having twice undergone ankle surgery, scoring 12 points in Saracens’ narrow victory over Bristol at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium. He was replaced after 70 minutes for a head injury assessment and while the Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall said shortly after full time that Farrell had passed, he has not been deemed ready to face Sale. It is another blow for the England captain, who has managed just six appearances for club and country this season. After the Bristol victory, McCall admitted that Farrell would improve the more he could string a series of matches together but his latest setback is typical of his stop-start season so far. Indeed, there were signs of rust in Farrell’s performance last weekend and his tackling technique was again put under the microscope after he was penalised for a high tackle on Piers O’Conor. Tuilagi, who like Farrell missed the entire Six Nations, is set to feature for the first time since 12 February. Tuilagi was due to start England’s third match against Wales but sustained another hamstring injury in training. It was the same hamstring he injured on England duty in November, leading to questions as to whether he had been rushed back into the international fold too soon. Both players were sorely missed during England’s disappointing Six Nations campaign and would be shoo-ins for the summer tour of Australia, provided they can demonstrate their form and fitness between now and the end of the season. Saracens, meanwhile, can take another step closer towards securing a home playoff with victory at the AJ Bell stadium while Sale can move into the top four with a win. “We didn’t quite click last week but the group hasn’t been together for a while so we learnt a lot and all of our focus is on finishing this block on a high,” said the Saracens centre Nick Tompkins. “Sale have a wealth of talent and they will be very physical but we feel like we are building some good momentum and want to continue that.”",Sport/Sport,Owen Farrell sits out Sale trip after setback in recovery from ankle surgery,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/31/rugby-union-owen-farrell-sits-it-out-after-setback-in-recovery-from-ankle-surgery
4/1/2022,"Vladimir Putin has indicated that Russia could rip up contracts to supply gas to Europe unless “unfriendly” states drop their refusal to start paying for gas in roubles from Friday. “To buy Russian gas, they need to open rouble accounts in Russian banks,” Putin said in a televised appearance. “It is from those accounts that gas will be paid for, starting 1 April. If such payments aren’t made, we will consider this a failure by the client to comply with its obligations.” According to an order signed by Putin, gas buyers should open accounts with the state-controlled Gazprombank to facilitate currency exchange on purchases. The G7 group of advance economies – the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada – has so far refused to countenance meeting his demand for rouble payments. However, one gas analyst said the use of Gazprombank as an intermediary may allow western economies to drop their opposition. He said market prices for gas, which have risen slightly today, did not indicate fears of an imminent big supply disruption. The impasse has already led to Germany and Austria making preparations for potential gas rationing, activating an emergency plan designed to help it cope with any disruption in supplies from Russia. There are fears Putin could extend the rouble payment plan to include exports of oil, grain, fertilisers, coal, metals and other key commodities. The value of the rouble collapsed in the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine, before making a partial recovery. With the currency still trading at low levels, Russian exports bring in less money to subsidise state services and fund the war than previously expected. The gas payment plan could help prop up the rouble, shoring up a Russian economy that has been hit by western sanctions.",News/World news,Putin signs order demanding gas payments in roubles from Friday,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/putin-indicates-he-may-turn-off-gas-supplies-to-europe-overnight-russia-roubles
4/1/2022,"Dispute over the legacy of staging the men’s World Cup in Qatar broke out on the floor of the Fifa Congress on Thursday, with the president of the Norwegian Football Federation calling for stronger action, only for the head of Qatar’s Supreme Committee to insist she “educate” herself over the issues. In a tightly managed set-piece event in Doha before Friday’s World Cup draw, Lise Klaveness’s address upset the consensus when she said Fifa must act as a “role model” and called on the organisation to do more to support the families of migrant workers who had been killed and those injured working on the World Cup project. “Our game can inspire dreams and break down barriers but as leaders we must do it right and to the highest standards,” said Klaveness, a former Norway international. “We cannot ignore the calls for change and how Fifa runs the game has so much to say for how the game is perceived. Fifa must act as a role model. “In 2010 World Cups were awarded by Fifa in unacceptable ways with unacceptable consequences. Human rights, equality and democracy – the core interests of football – were not in the starting XI. These basic rights were pressured on to the field as substitutes, mainly by outside voices. Fifa has addressed these issues but there is still a long way to go.” Klaveness went on to call for specific reforms. “Migrant workers injured or families of those who died in the buildup to the World Cup must be cared for,” she said. “Fifa, all of us, must take all measures to implement change. It is vital that the current leadership continue wholeheartedly in this way. There is no room for employers that do not secure the safety of workers, no room for hosts who cannot host the women’s game, who cannot legally guarantee the safety and respect of LGBTQ+ people coming to this theatre of dreams. I fear our stadiums will be empty in the future if we overlook the urgency of the moment.” The Norwegian FA president’s speech was followed by an unexpected address from the general secretary of the Honduran FA, José Ernesto Mejía, who said it was not “the right forum or the right moment” to make such remarks. The secretary general of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC), Hassan al-Thawadi, then gave a passionate address defending the steps Qatar has taken since winning the right to host the World Cup. He said the country had undertaken “12 years of continuous work … dedicated to ensuring this tournament leaves truly transformational social, human, economic and environmental legacies to be remembered. We are acutely aware of the spotlight that comes with hosting the greatest show on earth and we have embraced it.” Thawadi said that the most important legacy of the World Cup would be to correct prejudices that saw the Arab world as a place of conflict. He said he also wanted to reassure those concerned over a social legacy, citing the positive reports made by international trade unions over the development of workers’ rights. “Our adversaries have become allies,” he said “[and] even our harshest critics such as Amnesty recognise our commitment.” He also criticised Klaveness for not speaking to the SC individually about Norwegian concerns. “On [the issue of a] social legacy, I would like to assure the Norwegian FA” he said. “[But] I’d like to express a disappointment. Madame president visited our country and did not request a meeting. She did not attempt a dialogue before addressing Congress today. We have always been open for dialogue, we always welcomed constructive criticism. We have always had the doors open for anybody who wants to understand the issues, who wants to educate themselves before passing any judgment.” The Guardian understands that Klaveness has addressed Thawadi personally over the social legacy in Qatar as part of a Uefa working group which has visited the country. There was also controversy over a moment later in the Congress when Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, presented a video documenting the progress made on workers and human rights in Qatar since it won the World Cup. The video said that the SC was instrumental in ending the kafala system in the country and featured the general secretary of the Building and Woodworkers’ International, Ambet Yuson, praising improvements in worker safety. “The health and safety standards in the stadium construction sites are at the same level as the health and safety standards in Europe,” Yuson said. The video also showed Piara Powar, chief executive of the Fare network which campaigns for equality in football, talking about dialogue over the safety of LGBTQ+ supporters in Qatar, where homosexuality remains illegal. Although Powar is quoted as being positive about the process, the Guardian understands that he also expressed concerns over a continued lack of guarantees over supporter safety, remarks not in the video. On Thursday 16 organisations focused on LGBTIQ+ rights called for the SC to act on supporter safety, saying that action has been slow and that “reassurances about the safety of LGBTIQ+ people and the mechanisms in place to ensure safety have not been adequate”. The organisations said they had submitted eight requests for action to Fifa and the SC, but had yet to receive any response from the latter. Infantino announced he was to run for a second four-year term as president.",Sport/Football,Qatar World Cup chief bites back after criticism from Norwegian FA,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/31/qatar-world-cup-chief-norwegian-fa-lise-klaveness
