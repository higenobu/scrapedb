1/18/2022,"Ithink we are probably supposed to express bafflement that there is still an audience for shows such as Keeping Up With the Aristocrats (ITV), in which we are promised, explicitly and without irony, “exclusive access” to “Britain’s most prominent dynasties”. To bewail the fact that the thought of seeing how the 0.1% live who were in the right place at the right time when William the Conqueror came to town still has us in its thrall. And to ponder whether the continuing reduction of the nation – its democracy, economy, cultural life, morality – to rubble at the hands of the elite (aristocracy-allied even when they’re not actually aristos) will ever curb the appetite for watching them in their natural, heavily pargeted habitats. But television viewing is a complex business. You can keep up with the aristocrats for an hour in much the same way as you watch Bridgerton or Downton Abbey. Pure escapism – what would it be like to have won life’s lottery and spend your days wandering round a Georgian mansion being a second cousin of Prince Charles (like Lord Ivar Mountbatten) or the 400-year-old, 126-room sprawl of Carlton Towers like Lord Gerald Fitzalan-Howard (brother of the Duke of Norfolk and related to most of the people you read about in Philippa Gregory novels). “I’m always full of ideas,” he says. “Some good. Some just completely rubbish.”  And just who would not want to be Princess Olga Romanoff? Yes, one of the Romanovs, whose great uncle was the Tsar, murdered in 1918 by the Bolsheviks. The surviving family was scooped up by King George and put into Provender House in Kent, a 13th-century mansion Olga grew up in and still lives in. She is single, has a gay best friend to keep her company, and the Royal Windsor Horse Show to keep her entertained. She occasionally contemplates getting a boyfriend but says “I like the SAS type. A trained killer with a good body. But generally they turn out to be complete shits.” This, children, is what’s known as being in the very prime of life. Or you could be swanning round a 17th-century pile with 500 acres and a vineyard, like Alexandra Sitwell and her husband Rick. Though he is the kind of man who reckons the greatest crime in life is “to be boring” and wears loud shirts and coloured glasses in an apparent attempt to prove himself otherwise, so I think we can infer Alexandra does have her own problems. I’d recommend a lot of long walks alone around that 500 acres if I were you, pet, and a deal of steady, secret drinking from the vineyard. Or go and have a word with Princess Olga. She’ll see you right. We are sliding, already, into the second type of viewing – the hatewatch. There’s simply nothing like watching a bunch of people braying about their suffering (“If we sell a Titian, we’ll only have 72 Titians left! What am I supposed to look at? The Vermeers?”) to feel the cleansing fire of a hatred that harms no one. The third kind is liberation viewing. To watch Lord Mountbatten and his husband James stress about finding enough tablecloth underlays to equip the one-night-only, £165-a-head pop-up restaurant they have hired Jean-Christophe Novelli to preside over is to know 27 types of catharsis at once, followed by a deep, deep peace. “I could not,” you think serenely, gazing into the middle distance from the sofa, “care less. Let the whole thing fail. Let them eat Greggs. It would matter – unlike almost everything else in this burning hellscape of a world – not one jot.” In these absurd offerings, however, there is always at least one protrusion that snags your attention and leaves you wanting more. In this case, it is Dave, butler to Alexandra and Rick. Dave’s father, he tells us, was a pig farmer. His job, according to him, is the same thing. “You feed ’em when they’re hungry and clean up their mess.” I will take a 90-minute special on Dave and his dad as soon as you’re ready, ITV.",Arts/Television & radio,Keeping Up With the Aristocrats review – as ludicrous as a real-life Downton Abbey,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/17/keeping-up-with-the-aristocrats-review-as-ludicrous-as-a-real-life-downton-abbey
1/18/2022,"Oregon’s public pension fund, which manages tens of billions of dollars in retirement savings, appears to have privately given its blessing to a 2019 deal by an investment fund to acquire NSO Group, the controversial spyware company. A source with close knowledge of the matter and emails seen by the Guardian suggest that a senior official at the pension fund signalled his strong support for the takeover of NSO as early as 2018, months before the deal was announced.  Last month, Oregon officials said they were “deeply disturbed” by reports that NSO Group “enabled widespread human rights violations”. However, it now appears that the Oregon pension fund, one of the most prominent in the US, gave its tacit approval over an investment in NSO several years ago – at a time when security researchers were already publicly raising alarms about the company. NSO, which is based in Israel, was recently blacklisted by the Biden administration and accused of acting against the national security interests of the US. The US commerce department said in November 2021 it was adding NSO to the so-called Entity List based on evidence that the company had developed and supplied spyware to foreign governments that used the tools to “maliciously target government officials, journalists, businesspeople, activists, academics and embassy workers”. A spokesperson for Tobias Read, the Democratic Oregon state treasurer who has oversight of the pension fund, issued a statement in December supporting the administration’s decision. The statement was significant because Oregon invested $233m in a private equity firm, Novalpina Capital, in 2017. Novalpina’s fund then acquired a controlling stake in NSO in 2019, making the Oregon fund the largest indirect investor in the spyware company. A spokesperson for Read, who has oversight of public investments but does not personally manage relationships with private equity managers, said in the December statement that the treasurer supported the sanctioning of technology companies that “facilitate human rights violations and the oppression of journalists by selling technology to authoritarian regimes.” The spokesperson said that Oregon was a limited partner in private equity fund investments and did not participate in the “selection or operation of private equity portfolio companies” held by it private equity investors. “We’ve been deeply disturbed by reports about developments concerning NSO Group,” the statement said. An investigation by the Guardian suggests that a senior official at the Oregon pension fund was briefed on Novalpina’s desire to buy NSO – and appears to have indicated to partners there that he supported the deal – as early as 2018. Records suggest that Michael Langdon, director of private markets at the Oregon State Treasury’s investment division, met the three founding partners at Novalpina in London on 15 June 2018. According to a source familiar with the matter, Langdon voiced his support for Novalpina to pursue the acquisition. A 24 June 2018 email that was sent by a person involved in the talks described Novalpina as discussing the opportunity “in detail” with the private equity firm’s three largest investors, who had voiced “strong support” for the transaction. At the time, Langdon is said to have already been familiar with NSO and what insiders sometimes called the “noise” – or bad publicity – around the company because the Oregon pension fund was also an investor in Francisco Partners, a California-based firm whose fund previously owned a majority stake in NSO. “He was very supportive throughout,” said one investor who asked not to be named, describing Langdon’s approach to the Novalpina fund’s takeover of NSO. A spokesperson for the Oregon treasury declined to answer the Guardian’s questions. In an emailed statement, the spokesperson said: “Our role as a limited partner means we can’t comment on specifics related to our active investments, and as we have said before, we do not participate in the selection, operation, or control of portfolio companies.” Concerns about the possible abuse of NSO’s hacking software by its government clients date back to 2016. By 2018, researchers at Citizen Lab had issued reports that said there appeared to be a “lack of due diligence by NSO Group concerning the sale of their spyware, and widespread misuse of the spyware by several government clients”. Researchers had delved into allegations that journalists and human rights activists in Mexico and the UAE had their phones hacked by governments using Pegasus. Then, in October 2018, new allegations emerged that a Saudi dissident who was based in Canada, a close associate of the murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi, had been targeted and infected with NSO spyware by a client of the company. NSO denied the claim. The controversy did not affect the takeover of the Israeli firm by Novalpina’s fund. Months later, after the acquisition of a majority stake in NSO became public, an announcement of the deal appears to have been sent to Langdon by Stephen Peel, co-founder of Novalpina. The senior Oregon official responded on 21 March 2019: “This is great. Thanks. Let’s keep in touch on this.” As allegations of misuse of NSO’s technology by the company’s government clients multiplied, a spokesperson for the Oregon pension fund responded to inquiries from the Guardian by saying it was against the fund’s policy to comment on specific portfolio investments given its role as a limited partner. It did issue a statement after the Biden administration announced that it was adding NSO to a US blacklist. A spokesperson for Tobias Read said in December that the Oregon treasury had been working with the fund’s new manager, which replaced Novalpina in 2021, to obtain a “full accounting” of the prior fund manager’s investment activities over the past several years, and had reached out to Oregon’s attorney general on “various legal options”. The spokesperson did not elaborate on what was meant by “various legal options”. Novalpina’s three co-founding partners, Stefan Kowski, Stephen Peel and Bastian Lueken, did not respond to requests for comment from the Guardian.",News/World news,"Oregon public pension fund gave blessing to NSO Group deal, sources suggest ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/17/oregon-public-pension-fund-gave-blessing-to-nso-group-deal-sources-suggest
