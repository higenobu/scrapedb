1/10/2022,"Siraj Raval told CNBC that his Tesla Model 3 mines bitcoin and ethereum for around 20 hours a day. He called his car a ""computer with wheels"" and said he made between $400 and $800 a month. But an EV dealer told CNBC that mining crypto with a Tesla battery wasn't worth it. The owner of a 2018 Tesla Model 3 told CNBC that he makes up to $800 a month by using his car to mine cryptocurrency. Siraj Raval, who described his car as a ""computer with wheels"", said that he'd plugged an inverter into a power socket in his car and used it to power a computer he ran bitcoin-mining software on. He said that he makes between $400 and $800 a month, depending on the value of bitcoin and ethereum. Even though it could void his Tesla's vehicle warranty, which covers the battery for up to eight years, he believes it's worth it. ""It's so simple to hack into this computer car,"" he said. He said he'd also used the car's battery to run interconnected graphics processing units, which mine cryptocurrencies. Raval said he spends roughly 20 hours a day mining with his Tesla battery. He said that he spends between $30 and $60 a month charging his car's battery. But Wisconsin electric-vehicle dealer Chris Allessi told CNBC that using a Tesla to mine cryptocurrencies wasn't worth it. Because he bought his Tesla before 2017, Allessi got access to the company's free lifetime Supercharging program, meaning he doesn't have to pay to load up his battery. He said that he used this free power to mine cryptocurrencies but that he gave up because it wasn't profitable enough. ""Did it work? Yes. Did it mine anything worthwhile to be able to be profitable in any way, shape, or form? No,"" Allessi told CNBC, speaking about his experience mining monero. And despite bitcoin's soaring value, Allessi estimated that the growing difficulty of mining means if he mined it now he'd get around $1 or $2 worth of the cryptocurrency in 60 hours. ""Why would you want to put that kind of wear and tear on a $40,000 to $100,000 car?"" he added. ""The difficulty is so high ... I could make more money working at McDonald's,"" he said. Tesla hacker and cryptocurrency miner Thomas Sohmers told CNBC he doubted Raval's claim, saying he didn't think it would be possible to make so much profit by mining using his car. But Raval said that he didn't plan on stopping mining cryptocurrency using his Tesla. He said that in the future he wanted to make his car a fully-autonomous robotaxi that mines whenever it's not on the road.

1/10/2022,"Trump heaped praise on Revolver News, which has pushed pro-Trump conspiracy theories. Revolver, run by former aide Darren Beattie, suggested the FBI is to blame for the Capitol riot. Trump has promoted narratives seeking to divert blame from him and his supporters. Former President Donald Trump praised a right-wing website that helped promote the baseless conspiracy theory that the FBI instigated the violence in the Capitol riot. In a statement Sunday, Trump praised Revolver News, which has for months been pushing the conspiracy theory. It is run by Darren Beattie, who worked as a speechwriter in his administration. ""Congratulations to Darren Beattie and Revolver News who have exposed so much of the Fake News' false narrative about January 6th. Because of Darren's work, and others, Americans aren't buying into the Unselect Committee's attempts to smear 75 million (plus!) Americans. The newly minted term 'Fedsurrection,' was even trending!"" wrote Trump. ‚ÄîLiz Harrington üçä (@realLizUSA) January 9, 2022 Revolver News, a fringe aggregation website with some right-wing commentary, has been cited frequently by top-rated Fox News host Tucker Carlson in his promotion of the FBI-plot conspiracy theory, which holds that federal agents sparked the attack on the Capitol to discredit Trump supporters. Beattie is a frequent guest on Carlson's show. In a fact check of his theory, the Associated Press noted that it rests on the claim that many of those who took part in the violence at the Capitol have not been indicted. This, Beattie groundlessly claims, shows that they are probably FBI agents. Carlson propelled the claims to a wide audience in a recent three-part documentary which attempts to whitewash the role of Trump supporters in the violence. It prompted the resignations of two staffers at Fox. According to a report in Axios, Trump was planning to further trumpet the FBI theory in a speech on the anniversary of the riot, which he instead canceled. Beattie worked as a speechwriter for the Trump administration, before being fired in 2018 over attending a conference at a group, the Mencken Club, that was also attended by a white supremacist. In the closing days of the Trump administration, Beattie was appointed to the Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad, which oversees sites including Holocaust memorials. The appointment was widely criticized. Insider has contacted the board to confirm whether Beattie is still serving.

1/10/2022,"By Jan Wolfe (Reuters) - Donald Trump's lawyers on Monday will try to persuade a federal judge to throw out a series of lawsuits by Democratic lawmakers and two police officers alleging that the former president incited the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. The three lawsuits, by Democratic U.S. representatives including Eric Swalwell and Jerry Nadler, as well as two Capitol Police officers who battled rioters claim that Trump is liable for injuries to police and lawmakers. The Democratic lawmakers have invoked an 1871 law passed to fight the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan that prohibits political intimidation. The lawsuits charge that the worst attack on the U.S. Capitol since the War of 1812 was a direct consequence of Trump's actions, including a fiery speech he gave shortly before thousands of his supporters stormed the building in an effort to overturn President Joe Biden's election. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington is scheduled to hear oral arguments in the three cases at 1 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). He is unlikely to issue a ruling on Monday, but the hearing may shed light on whether Trump and allies can be held liable in civil court for the deadly Capitol siege. Trump was already impeached by the House of Representatives and acquitted by the Senate on charge of inciting the riot, which is also under investigation by a House select committee. Swalwell's lawsuit includes similar claims against Trump allies who also spoke at the Jan. 6 rally, including campaign lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Trump‚Äôs eldest son Donald Trump Jr., and Republican congressman Mo Brooks. Brooks has sought to dismiss Swalwell's claims, arguing his remarks at the Jan. 6 rally were within the scope of his duties as a House member. A law called the Westfall Act protects federal employees from being sued for actions taken as part of their jobs. Trump and his co-defendants have argued that their remarks preceding the Jan. 6 attack were political speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. ""Plaintiffs are all members of Congress; each has engaged in controversial speech,"" Trump's lawyer Jesse Binnall wrote in a court filing. ""Yet they have chosen to foreswear their oaths to support and defend the Constitution by attempting to undermine the First Amendment by bringing this lawsuit, based on their longstanding and public grudges against President Trump."" The two Capitol Police officers who sued Trump are James Blassingame and Sidney Hemby.
