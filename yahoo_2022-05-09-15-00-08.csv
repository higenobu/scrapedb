5/9/2022,"By Elaine Lies TOKYO (Reuters) - An Elon Musk tweet saying Japan would ""eventually cease to exist"" without a higher birthrate set off a flood of sarcasm and anger on Monday - though much of the angst was aimed at a Japanese government many said did little to address the issue. Musk, the head of electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc, at the weekend tweeted, ""At risk of stating the obvious, unless something changes to cause the birth rate to exceed the death rate, Japan will eventually cease to exist. This would be a great loss for the world."" The comment hit a nerve among Japan watchers and in Japan, whose population peaked in 2008 and has declined since due to its low birthrate to about 125 million as of last year despite government warnings and sporadic attempts to grapple with the issue. But Japan remains the world's third-largest economy, host to global heavyweights ranging from car manufacturers to games developers, and is a key link in global semiconductor supply chains. ""What is even the point of tweeting this?"" wrote Tobias Harris, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. ""The anxieties surrounding Japan's demographic future is not that 'Japan will eventually cease to exist' but rather the profound social dislocations that are occurring as a result of the decline to a lower population level."" Others noted sluggish birthrates plague many nations besides Japan, including Germany - where Tesla has just opened a new factory - and that Japan was simply being hit first. But many Japanese commentators said the situation was not surprising and slammed their government for not doing enough to fight it, such as by providing more daycare centres and making it easier for women to return to work after having children. ""They keep saying the birthrate's falling, but given that the government isn't taking thorough steps to deal with it, what can we say? Everything they say and do is contradictory,"" wrote Twitter user SROFF. ""In this environment, who's going to say 'Okay, let's have a child'? I despair for Japan.""

5/9/2022,"A Michigan man who left his car at a dealership for an oil change and tire rotation is being sued after his vehicle was involved in the death of one of the dealership's employees. Sergio Enrique Diaz-Navarro took his red 2019 Wrangler to a Chrysler Jeep Dodge dealership on March 13, 2020, and 19-year-old lube technician Daniel Thompson worked on the car. After the service was complete, the vehicle ""lurched forward"" as the young employee attempted to operate it, crushing 42-year-old mechanic Jeffrey Hawkins against a cabinet, court records show. MISSING COLORADO MOM SUZANNE MORPHEW'S DAUGHTERS STANDING BY THEIR FATHER AFTER DISMISSAL OF MURDER CHARGES Thompson had lowered the Jeep from the vehicle lift, and then tried to start the car and let it idle to ensure there were no oil leaks around the filter, according to court records. ""Thompson reached into the vehicle and pressed brake with his right foot, keeping his other foot on the floor,"" the plaintiff summary reads. ""He pressed the start button. When the vehicle did not start, he took his foot off the brake and depressed the clutch pedal. He again hit the start button. This time the Jeep started. He removed his foot from the clutch, still standing outside the vehicle. The vehicle lurched forward."" Hawkins was taken to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries, according to The Kansas City Star. Diaz-Navarro and Thompson were both sued in a Michigan circuit court in March 2021. MINNESOTA POLICE BODY CAM SHOWS DAUNTE WRIGHT'S MOM IN TENSE EXCHANGE WITH COPS: ‘I WILL SUE YOU’ Attorney David Femminineo, who is representing Hawkins' estate, told FOX 2 that Thompson did not know how to drive the vehicle's manual transmission and did not have a license. The attorney also said the dealership cannot be sued because of a legal standard preventing an employee from suing their boss for negligence, which, in this case, would be the hiring of someone who should not have been driving. Because the incident happened at work and involved two employees, the boss cannot be sued, FOX 2 notes. Diaz-Navarro's attorney told FOX 2 he plans to fight the case in a trial later this month. ""When you hand your car over to anybody including the valet or the person at the service desk at your local dealership, you better be able to trust that person,"" the attorney said. LILY PETERS MURDER: UNSEALED COMPLAINT REVEALS NEW DETAILS IN WISCONSIN GIRL'S DEATH Femminineo told McClatchy News that the car owner is responsible for Hawkins' death in the same way that someone who lent another person their vehicle would be liable for any injuries caused by the driver. He said a person who lends their car is liable for negligent acts because they gave the other person permission to use their vehicle. According to a summary filed in court on March 1, the court has ordered the Rochester Hills Chrysler Jeep Dodge dealership, where the incident occurred, to indemnify Diaz-Navarro if he is found liable of negligence. ""So in reality, the owner is going to be held responsible, but the dealership’s insurance company is paying,"" Femminineo told McClatchy News.

5/9/2022,"SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria will not support European Union's new set of sanctions against Russia if the Balkan country does not get a derogation from the proposed ban on buying Russian oil, Deputy Prime Minister Assen Vassilev said late on Sunday. European Union governments moved closer on Sunday to agreeing to tough sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, but scheduled more talks for Monday to work out how to ensure countries most dependent on Russian energy can cope. ""The talks will continue tomorrow, on Tuesday too, a meeting of the leaders may be needed to conclude them. Our position is very clear. If there be a derogation for some of the countries, we want to get a derogation too,"" Vassilev told national BNT television. ""If not, we will not support the sanctions. But I do not expect to get to that, based on the talks at the moment,"" he said. Landlocked Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, which all depend heavily on Russian crude delivered via Soviet-era pipelines face a challenge to secure alternative sources and have asked for a derogation from the ban. Bulgaria has also requested a derogation. The European Commission proposed changes on Friday to its initial planned embargo on Russian oil to give the three countries more time to shift their energy supplies, while Bulgaria was not offered concessions, EU sources said. Vassilev said Bulgaria also needs to get a derogation, as its only refinery at the Black Sea port of Burgas needed time to upgrade its de-sulphurization facilities necessary to switch to processing only non-Russian crude. Neftochim Burgas refinery, owned by Russia's LUKOIL, is the dominant fuel provider in the Balkan country, the poorest in the 27-member bloc. At present, half of the oil it processes comes from Russia. Lack of an exemption would either pose serious environmental risks to the region of Burgas or force the oil refinery to decrease processing, which would create a deficit and further increase fuel prices, he said.

5/9/2022,"With price levels continuing to spike, the Fed is no longer using the word ‘transitory’ to describe inflation. U.S. consumer prices jumped 8.5% in March from a year ago, marking the fastest increase since December 1981. That could give the Fed more reason to continue raising interest rates — something that’s already casting a giant shadow over the stock market. It’s a vicious cycle criticized by many investing veterans. And Rich Dad, Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki is one of the latest experts to sound the alarm. “When inflation goes up, we’re going to wipe out 50% of the U.S. population,” he told Stansberry Research earlier this month. Let’s take a closer look at what Kiyosaki means by that. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. Kiyosaki isn’t exactly pleased with the current state of the U.S. economy. “America has stopped producing products, we produce bubbles,” he says, adding that we now have bubbles in the real estate market, the stock market and the bond market. The author also criticizes President Joe Biden’s decision to halt the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which he believes is a major reason energy prices are so high. It also spells trouble for those who want to enjoy their golden years. When the bubbles burst, Kiyosaki says, the stock market will crash. So those relying on their 401(k) plans “are toast.” “We don’t have a retirement, our pensions are bust.” Given his grim outlook, it’s no big surprise that Kiyosaki is a fan of safe haven assets like gold and silver. Precious metals can’t be printed out of thin air like fiat money, and they’ve been helping investors preserve their purchasing power for centuries. The price of gold is up about 8% year to date. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has given investors a new reason to check out the yellow metal. While Kiyosaki owns gold — he first purchased the yellow metal in 1972 — he prefers silver in today’s economic environment. In a tweet last month, Kiyosaki revealed that he had purchased 2,500 American Silver Eagle bullion coins and offered his bullish reasons for doing so. “Gold already moved up. Bitcoin still too high,” the tweet says. “Silver 50% below all time high. Silver an industrial metal as well as $.” Bubbles tend to pop — eventually. When they do, many people see their wealth take a significant hit. But large declines also create opportunities for those who are willing to buy the dip. “The good thing about a bubble is when they burst, everything goes on sale,” Kiyosaki says. During the financial crisis of 2008, the author started “buying real estate at bargain prices.” Based on how much real estate has gone up since then, it’s fair to say that was a sharp move.

5/9/2022,"(Reuters) -Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday he was speechless after Russian shelling destroyed a museum dedicated to the 18th century philosopher and poet Hryhoriy Skovoroda. The overnight attack in the village of Skovorodynivka in eastern Ukraine hit the roof of the museum, setting the building ablaze and injuring a 35-year-old custodian. The most valuable items had earlier been moved for safety, said Kharkiv regional governor Oleh Sinegubov. ""Every day of this war the Russian army does something that leaves me speechless. But then the next day it does something else that makes you feel the same way again,"" Zelenskiy said in a late night video address. ""Targeted strikes against museums - not even terrorists would think of this. But this is the kind of army we are fighting against,"" he said. Skovoroda, of Ukraine Cossack origin, spent the last years of his life in the village of Ivanovka, which was later renamed in his honour - Skovorodynivka. ""This year marks the 300th anniversary of the great philosopher's birth,"" Sinegubov said in a post on social media. ""The occupiers can destroy the museum where Hryhoriy Skovoroda worked for the last years of his life and where he was buried. But they will not destroy our memory and our values.""

5/9/2022,"The Chinese ambassador to the US has called on Chinese-Americans to help to improve US-China relations, which he said were ""going through serious difficulties"". Speaking at a reception hosted by the Committee of 100, a group of elite Chinese-Americans in business, government, academia and the arts, Qin Gang also pledged support to combat anti-Asian hate. The comments by Qin came as the US is celebrating Asian-American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month in May, and as hate crimes targeting Asian-American communities have surged sharply, partly driven by anti-China political rhetoric and misinformation about the Covid-19 pandemic.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. According to a recent poll by the non-profit Leading Asian Americans to Unite for Change and The Asian American Foundation, at least 21 per cent of US adults now say Asian-Americans are at least partly responsible for Covid-19, up from 11 per cent in 2021. Meanwhile 33 per cent believed that ""Asian-Americans are more loyal to their country of origin than to the United States"" - up from 20 per cent last year. Qin admitted that bilateral relations between China and the US faced serious difficulties, but said Chinese-Americans could play a role because ""the China-US relationship concerns not only the future of the world, but also the welfare of Chinese-Americans"", according to a transcript published by the Chinese embassy on Saturday. ""China is regarded as the most serious competitor and even 'national security threat No 1' of the US. With various kinds of misunderstandings, misperceptions and misjudgments going on, the risks of confrontation and conflict are on the rise,"" he said.

""I hope that you can help build China-US friendship, advance exchanges and cooperation, bridge differences and ease confrontation. Ultimately, Chinese-Americans can only prosper when the China-US relationship enjoys sound and stable development."" Qin's audience included Gary Locke, a former US ambassador to China and chairman of the Committee of 100, and Huang Zhengyu, a prominent businessman and former White House Fellow. Qin said that amid the rise of pandemic-fuelled racism, Asian-American communities should be united, to ""get more engaged in politics, get more integrated into American society, and better protect your legitimate rights and interests"", adding that the Chinese embassy would also work with Chinese-American communities to stop anti-Asian hate. Americans of Asian origin, who make up 7 per cent of the US population, are one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the US but are increasingly targeted by anti-Asian hate crimes, which were up by 339 per cent in 2021 compared with the year before, according to a study by the California State University Santa Barbara's Centre for the Study of Hate and Extremism in February. Fears peaked in March last year after eight people, six of them Asian women, were killed in a mass shooting in a spa in the Atlanta area. In March, hundreds of people lined up for pepper spray in Manhattan's Chinatown following the death of Michelle Alyssa Go, a 40-year-old Asian-American woman who was pushed into the path of an oncoming subway train.

5/9/2022,"WASHINGTON — The war in Ukraine has led some military experts to rethink the conventional wisdom on nuclear weapons, a reconsideration rooted in an acknowledgment that as frightening as the prospect of nuclear war is, a policy predicated on these fears has given the Kremlin too much license in Ukraine. “I think we have exaggerated the threat of the Kremlin using nuclear weapons and have made some policy decisions based on that exaggerated fear,” retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, chair of strategic studies at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told Yahoo News. Mainstream thinking about nuclear war has been guided by two related realities: that atomic weapons are immensely destructive and that if used once, they will be used repeatedly in a series of back-and-forth strikes that will only compound the devastation until there is nothing much left to devastate. Those were the lessons of Proud Prophet, an intensive 1983 simulation conducted by the U.S. government at the National Defense University in which dozens of security agencies and military commands took part. Proud Prophet began with what was expected to be a limited nuclear strike by the Soviet Union, only to quickly slip from the grasp of the combatants. “The result was a catastrophe that made all the wars of the past five hundred years pale in comparison,” Yale historian Paul Bracken wrote. “A half-billion human beings were killed in the initial exchanges and at least that many more would have died from radiation and starvation.” Given the diligence with which the simulation was conducted, Proud Prophet offered chilling evidence that however a nuclear war began, it could end only in annihilation. Fears of such an outcome receded after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, especially as nonstate actors like al-Qaida preoccupied the U.S. national security establishment. Still, it was only a matter of time before new geopolitical tensions gave rise to fresh nuclear anxieties. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February did just that. “The risk is higher now than it has been in decades,” Geoff Wilson, a policy analyst at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, told Yahoo News. Russia has openly courted the possibility, with Russian television last Sunday showing what a nuclear strike might do to the United Kingdom, one of many NATO allies now helping Ukraine. The following Wednesday, Russia conducted tests with nuclear-capable Iskander missile systems in Kaliningrad, a Russian territory within striking distance of European capitals and military installations. There followed assurances from the Russian foreign ministry that Russia was not contemplating nuclear war. After weeks of bluster, the assurance was difficult to parse. “We’re dealing with a nuclear-armed state,” Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall told the Washington Post late last month. “You cannot ignore that as you make decisions about how to respond.” However, some military analysts believe that harping on Russia’s nuclear capability is a mistake, one that emphasizes history over present-day reality. They argue that even if Russian President Vladimir Putin were to order a nuclear strike, it would be with smaller, tactical nuclear weapons, not the much bigger strategic devices that could obliterate cities like London or New York. And they argue that even if Putin did use nuclear weapons, the West could answer with conventional airstrikes as devastating as a nuclear attack but without the prospect of that counterstrike escalating into the kind of tit for tat envisioned by Proud Prophet. “We have been so worried about nuclear weapons and World War III that we have allowed ourselves to be fully deterred,” retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, the former NATO supreme allied commander, said to Radio Free Europe in early April. The tragic irony of the current moment is that Russia has leveled Ukrainian cities and killed thousands of Ukrainian citizens without having to resort to nuclear weapons. Although the West has been consistently supplying Ukraine with matériel, fears of provoking Russia into a nuclear attack have kept the United States and European allies from direct involvement in the conflict. In response to the same dynamic that frustrated Breedlove, retired U.S. Army Col. Sam Gardiner, who was a war games expert at the Naval War College and is a leading authority on military simulation, compiled a PowerPoint presentation last month in which he argued that if Russia did go nuclear, it would be with a smaller, 1-kiloton tactical device as opposed to the 15-kiloton device the United States dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 (a kiloton is equivalent to 1,000 tons of TNT). Russia has recalibrated its own thinking on nuclear deterrence since the collapse of the Soviet Union, as it has watched NATO creep ever closer to its borders. After NATO intervened to stop the war in Kosovo in 1999, the Kremlin held an exercise called Zapad (“West”) that simulated another NATO attack, this one on Russia. A poorly trained Russian military failed to stop a NATO attack, leading to a nuclear strike against Europe. This strike would be with smaller, tactical weapons in order to avoid the kind of annihilation Proud Prophet envisioned. Subsequent war games helped the Kremlin hone a strategy known as “escalate to de-escalate,” in which nuclear weapons frighten the enemy into submission without leading to mutually assured destruction. Effectively, ""escalate to de-escalate"" lowered the threshold for when nuclear weapons would be used but also called for less powerful nuclear weapons. The new approach informed Russia’s increasingly aggressive approach to former Soviet republics under Putin, including during his first incursion into Ukraine eight years ago. “Russia’s policy probably limited the West’s options for responding to the 2008 war in Georgia,” deterrence expert Nikolai Sokov wrote for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 2014. “And it is probably in the back of Western leaders’ minds today, dictating restraint as they formulate their responses to events in Ukraine.” For some in the U.S. military, the current invasion of Ukraine demands a fresh outlook, one that does not shy away from recognizing that Putin could use nuclear weapons. Some also wonder if other adversaries see Western deference to Russia's nuclear might as a good reason to start making nuclear threats of their own. At a congressional hearing on Thursday, Adm. Charles Richard, who heads U.S. Strategic Command, warned that China is “watching the war in Ukraine closely and will likely use nuclear coercion to their advantage in the future. Their intent is to achieve the military capability to reunify Taiwan by 2027, if not sooner.” Gardiner believes the Kremlin’s ""escalate to de-escalate"" policy commits Russia to using only tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, where the battle has taken on shades of the Zapad exercise. Gardiner does not believe Russia would use strategic nuclear weapons, even if the military situation continued to deteriorate. “You can only go so big, otherwise you will have crossed the line.” Putin is likely aware that using a nuclear weapon of any size in an offensive war would further alienate Russia from the West. “One nuclear weapon is still a nuclear weapon,” said Wilson, the nonproliferation expert. “That’s a taboo.” It may also be pointless. Ukrainian forces are too dispersed for such a strike to swing the war decisively in Russia’s favor. “Russian tactical nuclear weapons would have little or no impact on the operational battle,” Gardiner argues in his presentation, which he has shared with top military officials in Europe and the United States (including Breedlove, the former NATO commander). And even though Russia’s offensive has proved ineffective so far, its indiscriminate shelling and bombing have leveled Ukrainian cities like Mariupol and Kharkiv. “Damages from the Russian use of tactical nuclear weapons are no more horrific than the current damages being experienced in Ukraine from conventional weapons,” Gardiner wrote. Nor does Gardiner believe that a nuclear attack by Russia would require a nuclear response by the West. “Even if the Russians were to do something stupid, there is no need for us to follow that. We could destroy the majority of Russian forces in Ukraine with a five-day air campaign,"" he told Yahoo News. Another presentation he produced and shared with current Air Force officials shows that such a retaliatory assault would cripple the Russian military in the European sector while leading to the loss of only 10 U.S. aircraft. “Most war games have shown that once you start any nuclear exchange, things escalate very quickly,” said military historian Phillips O’Brien of St. Andrews University in the United Kingdom, who favorably shared Gardiner’s presentation on Twitter. He said he was intrigued by the presentation because “it opened up the possibility of responding to a Russian tactical nuclear usage through a very strong/devastating conventional response as opposed to possibly nuclear escalation.” For some experts in nuclear proliferation, entertaining nuclear exchanges is fundamentally dangerous. “If Putin uses [a tactical nuclear weapon],” Northeastern University political scientist Mai’a Cross told Yahoo News in an email, “he is demonstrating to the West that he will not back down until he achieves his goals. His willingness to break the taboo would likely alarm Western powers and put them on heightened alert as well, which only increases the chances of accidentally setting off a larger war.” Such a scenario would be an echo of Proud Prophet, in which a series of aggressions and counter-aggressions, maneuvers and misunderstandings, deepened the crisis. “These are world-ending arsenals we are talking about,” Wilson said. “Everyone should be afraid of them.”",World/Yahoo News,How serious is Russia about nuclear war?,https://news.yahoo.com/how-serious-is-russia-about-nuclear-war-090015298.html

5/9/2022,"Despite the Federal Reserve's increasingly hawkish stance, inflation continues to be a problem. In March, U.S. consumer prices rose 8.5% from a year ago, marking the biggest jump since 1981. Inflation erodes purchasing power. According to Shark Tank star and investment mogul Kevin O’Leary, that means keeping large sums of money in a low-interest savings account is a big mistake. “Right now in a bank account, you’re getting very little [interest],” he says in a recent interview with CNBC. “And inflation is over 6%. So you’re actually losing money every 12 months.” O’Leary suggests having three months of salary on hand in case of emergency. But after you've built that cushion, O’Leary recommends investing in index funds, which offer an easy and diversified way to get exposure to the stock market. Here’s a look at three index funds. Each of them focuses on different chunks of the market — own all three and you’re well diversified. Sign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms. The S&P 500 Index is widely regarded as the benchmark index for the U.S. stock market. Several funds track the S&P 500 in order to provide investors with convenient exposure to U.S. equities. But if a fund wants to use the S&P 500 name, it has to pay a licensing fee that essentially gets passed on to investors. The Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index Fund closely mirrors the performance of the S&P 500. But it’s not an “official” S&P 500 copycat, so it doesn’t have to pay the licensing fee. In turn, FNILX boasts an expense ratio of 0%. Every dollar you put into FNILX gets put to work. Small-cap stocks don’t get as much attention as their large-cap counterparts. But investors shouldn't ignore them. The largest companies we see today were once small. Companies with plenty of room to grow have tremendous upside. For a low-cost way to invest in this growth-oriented group, investors can check out Vanguard Small-Cap ETF. It tracks the CRSP U.S. Small Cap Index, which measures companies in the bottom 2%-15% of the investable universe. VB is diversified, holding around 1,550 stocks. It also has a low expense ratio of just 0.05%. One thing to keep in mind: Because small-cap stocks are relatively young, they tend to be more volatile than more established large-cap names. To truly diversify your portfolio — especially in this age of globalization — having some exposure outside of the U.S. is essential. Thankfully, it’s easy these days to invest overseas.

5/9/2022,"By Andrew Hay TAOS, N.M. (Reuters) -Firefighters in New Mexico begged holdout residents of a mountain village to evacuate on Sunday, before the United States' largest active wildfire races up a valley that is their only way out. Many have ignored requests to leave as they stayed on to defend centuries-old homes and ranches in Chacon, the village about 45 miles (72 km) northeast of Santa Fe, with a population of around 200. As the fire rapidly burned through forest 8 miles (13 km) away, firefighters and police warned people they would not be able to see or breathe once the blaze was upon them. ""It's coming, and it's coming fast,"" Dave Bales, the incident commander, told a briefing, adding that a lot of residents remained in Chacon and another threatened village, Guadalupita. About 12,000 households in northern New Mexico have been told to flee the second-largest wildfire in state history, which began in part after a burn prescribed by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) raged out of control on April 6. ""With winds like this, this fire can burn another 50,000 acres,"" William Sandoval, one of those who left Chacon, said from an evacuation center in the nearby town of Peñasco. The fire is advancing through forest packed with fuel after a century of USFS policy to douse blazes within hours and court-ordered bans on logging since the mid-1990s, said forest biologist Joshua Sloan at New Mexico Highlands University. Climate change has reduced snowpacks, leaving the area parched by its worst drought in at least five centuries, research on tree rings in the nearby Jemez Mountains shows. The so-called Hermits Peak Calf Canyon fire has consumed 176,273 acres (71,335 hectares), an area nearing the size of all five boroughs of New York City, and is 21 percent contained.

5/9/2022,"Brandon Newman, 24, shares his weight loss and body transformation journey with Men's Health.
 Ever since I was a kid, I've had an obsession with fitness: it has always been the light that has kept me on the straight and narrow. I've had many dark moments in my life, from being depressed and addicted to various substances, to nearly taking my own life in 2020. I was also diagnosed with IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) after I left the British Army, which resulted in medications that affected my bone health, and anti-inflammatory steroids with horrendous side effects including severe acne. At the time everything seemed pointless. This went on for many years until finally I found a medication that keeps it under control and gave me my life back. I think experiencing these hardships has ultimately given me the greatest perspective on how short life is, and over the last two years in particular, I've been making some big changes in my personal fitness. I've always been a ""follow the science"" kind of guy and looked at what is working for those who lead the industry. So for many years I had a push-pull-legs workout split and used to smash six days a week in the gym, however I ultimately found that was too much from both a mental and physical recovery standpoint. I started doing full-body workouts instead and ended up loving it, since I hate dedicated leg days. Video: The perfect core workout for ripped abs I've tried lots of different diets throughout the years—paleo, low carb, intermittent fasting—but again, what I've realized works for me is the IFFYM (""if it fits your macros"") approach. I also use a spreadsheet that calculates weekly weight gain/loss and calories that I enter each day. The best diet is one that you can put up with and enjoy for the rest of your life. I've never worked with a trainer, everything I've learned is self-taught from calorie counting to exercise routines. There is so much free information out there that essentially means you don't ever need a trainer. I got fit simply the way every other person gets fit; consistency and just making good behaviour choices that reward you in the long term. A good workout program with progressive overload, and tracking my calories and macros. The most difficult part of this journey for me was right at the beginning, when I decided I didn't want to look like that anymore, and I realized I had to start being responsible for the choices I made every day. That's hard because you know how easy it is to go home, relax, and choose the short term buzz over your long term wellbeing. So those initially weeks where you have to start saying no to the things that were your feelgood habits is the hardest. The brain becomes a rebellious child. But if someone asked me was it worth it, I can say without a doubt, yes! When you start doing right by yourself for long enough, you having a buzz that just can't be recreated with drugs or short term eating. I now feel the enjoyment of food to its fullest because it's balanced. I lost a total of 32 pounds, dropping from 195 to 162. For me, the biggest difference I noticed in my transformation was in my face: I keep being told how different I look now. Although, of course, noticing a bicep vein is a nice touch as well. Aside from the physical results, I also have more confidence, feel like I'm better at my job, and overall have a stronger sense of discipline and self-worth. I'm nowhere near finished, either. I'm currently in a cut phase while getting ready for a trip to Ibiza, as I'd like to be leaner for that. Then, when I've proven to myself that I can do it and I'm feeling confident enough, I'd really like to start a YouTube channel and some fitness-related social media, so I can help other people do the same. My advice for anyone who is starting out where I was, is to try to put yourself in the best position to make the changes you want. If you hang around pubs and nightclubs every Friday and Saturday but want to be something else, you need to start by putting yourself in the right environment. Everything becomes easier when you don't have to constantly say no to things. You start when you decide you want something different for your life. Do what you need to do for yourself first. You can't help or love others until you love or help yourself.

5/9/2022,"(Reuters) -U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns said on Saturday that China is closely monitoring Russia's conflict in Ukraine and that it is affecting Chinese leaders' calculations over Taiwan, the self-ruled island claimed by Beijing. Burns, speaking at a Financial Times event in Washington, said the Chinese government had been struck by Ukraine's fierce resistance to Russia's invasion and by the economic costs Russia is bearing. ""I think the Chinese leadership is looking very carefully at all this – at the costs and consequences of any effort to use force to gain control over Taiwan,"" Burns said. He cautioned, however, that it would not shift Chinese leader Xi Jinping's long-term goals over Taiwan. ""I don't for a minute think that this has eroded Xi's determination over time to gain control over Taiwan,"" said Burns. ""But I think it's something that's affecting their calculation about how and when they go about doing that."" China has refused to condemn Russia's war in Ukraine and has criticized Western sanctions on Moscow. Beijing and Moscow declared a ""no-limits"" strategic partnership several weeks before the Feb. 24 invasion, and have been forging closer energy and security ties in recent years to push back on the United States and the West. But Burns said the United States believed China was unsettled by the reputational damage of being associated with the ""brutishness"" of Russian President Vladimir Putin's military action. ""I think what the bitter experience, in many ways, of Putin's Russia in Ukraine over the last 10 or 11 weeks has done is demonstrate that that friendship actually does have some limits,"" Burns said.

5/9/2022,"Just a few days shy of what would be Madeleine McCann’s 19th birthday, a break in the case points to everyone’s worst fears: that the young Briton was abducted, sold and killed by a pedophile sex ring that worked in and around the Portuguese resort town where she disappeared 15 years ago. Thousands of tips and hundreds of sightings over the years led to dead ends until Christian Brückner was officially named a suspect on April 22 of this year. The 45-year-old German, who is in jail for raping a 72-year-old American in the village where McCann disappeared, denies taking any part in the crime. But in January 2022, a German documentary team found proof that Brückner did odd jobs at the Ocean Club in Praia da Luz in the spring of 2007 and would have been very familiar with the layout of the multi-building resort, including exits and less traveled lanes. That documentary led Hans Christian-Wolters, a German prosecutor focusing on Brückner’s alleged involvement, to dig into case further. Last week, he first told a Portuguese television channel and then confirmed to The Daily Beast that they have proof that he was at the center of the disappearance. Madeleine McCann Kidnapping Suspect Christian Brueckner Hoarded Little Girl Swimsuits and Kiddie Porn Wolters believes that Brückner was commissioned to kidnap McCann for a pedophile sex ring that then killed her—likely because of the media attention to her case, which would have made it impossible to sell her on or use her in illegal under-age pornography. Brückner wrote a series of bizarre letters to the German journalists who asked him if he was involved. He wrote back and explained how it wasn’t him. In one excerpt of a letter, he wrote a confusing missive that at once denied and toyed with his involvement. “Where possible, only drive during the day so my battered ‘hippy bus’ didn’t attract attention, only driving on roads I needed to and, most importantly, never provoking the police,” he wrote by way of explanation that he was staying out of sight because of his alleged drug dealing, for which he was later convicted. “So, that means not committing any crimes, certainly not abducting anyone. Having said that, this was just as absurd to me at the time as starting a nuclear war or slaughtering a chicken.” German police investigating Brückner found a cache of little girl swimsuits and volumes of kiddie porn in the camper van he was living in when he worked as a handyman. They also dug up a yard in Hanover, Germany. They did not find human remains, but they did unearth a child’s toy sand bucket in a cemented-off cellar on the premises. It is unclear if that evidence is part of the case being built against the convicted rapist. Police Find Child’s Toy Bucket in Secret Sealed Cellar Being Searched for Madeleine McCann Wolter says the new proof they have is not forensic, but local media in Portugal say it may be threads of the girl’s pink pajamas that she was wearing when she was snatched from her bed back in May 2007. A lawyer for Brückner called the accusation “bullshit” to The Daily Mail, and said he was actually having sex with a woman he later took to the airport the evening McCann went missing. McCann disappeared on the evening of May 3, 2007, from a bedroom in her family’s resort hotel room as her parents ate tapas with friends a few hundred yards away. McCann, then nearly 4, was taken while her infant twin-siblings slept nearby. Gerry and Kate McCann had taken turns with friends to check on the sleeping kids at regular intervals while they enjoyed an evening out when they discovered the elder of the McCann children was gone, along with a blanket. Portuguese police first focused on McCann’s parents—both doctors—who they suggested gave their daughter a sleeping drug that accidentally killed her. After wasting months on the theory, they finally cleared the couple, but by then the trail to the real criminal or criminals had gone cold. Brückner has not been charged in connection to McCann’s disappearance and presumed murder, but police are now searching for the woman he says he was with that night who can either corroborate his alibi or shed light into what really happened to the British toddler all those years ago.

5/9/2022,"Lifetime / Via giphy.com ""'Suspicious vehicle, driving very slow around the neighborhood, making notes at certain houses.' It didn't take long before she stopped being the HOA busybody. I saw her pulled over one day, so I knew the message got through."" —u/delorean623 —u/memon17 ""I was laid up in the house all day, and I get a knock at the door. It's the neighbor woman. Apparently, there's a rule that you cannot store a trailer in the driveway for more than three days, and this was day four. I needed to remove it by the end of the day or face a $500 fine. She handed me a paper listing the rule, and I considered just paying the fine, but instead, I angrily drove an hour each way to return my dad's trailer. What struck me as odd was there was a list of things you couldn't store in your driveway: personal watercraft, boats, trailers, etc. The odd part was that motorcycle was listed on there. I don't ride one myself, but I thought it was a totally reasonable thing to keep in a driveway. ""A year or so later, the HOA lady had started dating an older gentleman, and he had moved in with her. Turns out he rode a Harley, which was always parked in her driveway. She was home, so I walked over there and politely informed her about the violation. The next day, the motorcycle was parked on her new back porch, the one she bragged about to everyone who would listen so she could tell them how much it cost. I laughed to myself, but then I remembered the part about it needing to be behind a fence. Another knock at the door, and within a few days, a fence company was building a six foot privacy fence, which completely hid her fancy new deck."" —u/swyts ""This evening, I get a knock on the door. I look outside and see a woman walking away with two little dogs. One of the dogs stops and proceeds to shit on my cousin's lawn. ""I wait until the dog is done and open the door. By this time, the woman is beginning to walk away, but she sees me and turns around. She introduces herself as a board member of the HOA. Without taking a breath, she launches into a lecture about the trailer parked out front, how she's 'lucky to have walked by and caught this egregious violation of the HOA rules,' and how the trailer is an 'eyesore on the neighborhood.' She says she won't report me to the board and suggest a fine if I remove it immediately. ""I calmly inform her about the patio construction and how the crew needs to store their tools and materials at night, but she's absolutely foaming at the mouth about how 'tacky' it is to have a trailer in front of the house. I calmly inform her that I am not the homeowner, nor the owner of the trailer, and there isn't much I can do about it (especially at 6:30 p.m. on a Friday night). Nevertheless, she's adamant that I do SOMETHING. ""By this point, I'm fed up with this woman, who obviously has nothing better to do with her evening than bother her neighbors with bullshit. I look at her and casually ask, 'Just out of curiosity, what's the fine for not picking up after your dog if it shits in someone's lawn?' I tell ya, the look on her face at that point was classic. She stuttered for a minute before telling me she would 'have to look into that…' I told her I'd be grateful if she did because my cousin has been suspecting a neighbor of letting their dog poop in his lawn, so he set up a video camera in the window to catch the culprit. Upon hearing that, she got a little flustered and told me to tell the patio crew to hurry up, then she walked away with a huff. ""A small victory to be sure, but quite satisfying nevertheless."" —u/coulterpatton ""Apparently it was not all good as we received another letter stating the complaints had continued. I should note, we had just moved in not that long ago, and hadn't landscaped the back yet, so were letting our dogs pee on the front at night, which lead to the inevitable patches of bright green grass that grow stupid fast. It was in perfectly good shape outside some green spots in an otherwise average looking yard, and I do my best to keep things mowed and looking decent. ""Turns out our grumpy neighbor had taken real offense to this and started complaining to the HOA. While the HOA agreed this was not her business and definitely not theirs, I decided she was right and we should stop letting our dogs out in the front to pee. Now, I put them on the leash and let them do their business in her yard. And I'm clearly not the only one as her entire yard is now COVERED in pee spots. I'm pretty sure she's complained about everyone with a dog, and now the entire neighborhood takes their dogs to her yard. ""The best part: She actually does a shit job taking care of her lawn — weeds and crab grass everywhere. So today, I got to report her to the HOA for her yard looking like total shit. If it were any other house (there are much worse), I wouldn't care at all, but this lady wanted lawns without spots, so I'm just doing my part to enforce her rules."" —u/strongabbreviations5 ""After weeks of arguing, I had to literally pick up my 3,000-pound redwood gazebo and move it three more feet from the wall. ""Next, I get letters complaining about the vegetation in my front yard. I decided that I'm going to remove my tree and replace it. I also want to remove five plants. One of them is clearly dead by now. Their paperwork specifically says that I have to submit ONE item per design change request. So I submitted seven different requests. One for each plant. One for tree removal. One for tree installation. ""Now they're sending me generic copy-paste replies saying I can change the yard. None of them specify what design change was approved. I just keep replying to all of them asking for clarification. The last one I got said 'it' was for the tree removal and planting of a new tree...but it didn't include the original letter or even a reference number. So I just replied back that I would like the specific letter included in the email so I can have an approval paper trail. ""They burned me bad with the gazebo incident. I won't get burned again, and I'm having a grand time wasting as much of their time as possible. I smile every time I reply to an email asking for specific information."" —u/useless_skin ""Joan sent them a very threatening letter about their 'unlawful renter' and how fines would accrue if the 'unlawful renter' didn't vacate immediately. It was accompanied with a copy of that part of the bylaws and pictures of Liz's elderly mother taken through windows of their house. Creep alert! They wrote back that there was no renter and explained the situation. ""Joan did not believe that 'story' and had the HOA lawyer start sending them certified letters about their continued violations with ever increasing fines. After many increasingly aggressive back and forths, it all culminated in an association meeting where Liz, Dave, and Liz's mother came in with ID and birth certificates, and basically made Joan look like a pimple on the backside of humanity. They won, but Joan was furious, and swore she'd get them for something.  ""Cut to the following fall. Liz and Dave needed to repaint the house after making some siding repairs. They carefully checked the bylaws for approved paint colors and picked out a fairly bland shade of something between brown and tan. They gave the painters the color info listed in the bylaws, and painting happened. ""Less than a week after their house was painted, they got another certified letter from the HOA lawyer stating their house was the wrong color. It turned out the approved color and the swatches on file with the board no longer matched because the manufacturer had changed the colors in their line slightly due to some kind of formula change. Joan was out for blood after the 'unlawful renter' and forced them to have to repaint. ""Liz and Dave were taking no chances on the second try. They got the swatch set from the HOA. For some reason, it made no distinction between approved accent colors (most houses in the neighborhood had brightly colored doors) or house colors. They decided that if they had to paint their house a second time, Joan, the dog that caught the car, could live next to the most garish option they had. It was pumpkin orange. The painters asked multiple times if they were sure. They were very sure. You couldn't see the orange from inside, but you sure could from next door! ""Joan made many attempts to object to this, but it was within the letter of the HOA rules, and the house stayed orange until long after I moved away."" —u/sunnykl ""On Friday, I get a letter from the HOA stating that I am in violation of the restriction and could be fined. Okay, fair enough, they are correct on this one. I then noticed that the date of observation was on Wednesday. I called and said that couldn't be true because I took it down on Monday. Instead of admitting her mistake, she lied and said that she had seen it up on Wednesday. Now I was mad. ""I printed off a schedule of every sporting event the Bulldogs had in every sport, even club sports and then proceeded to fly the flag every single day there was any kind of game, match, regatta, etc., which was almost every single day. ""I then started getting letters stating I was in violation again. I would call on each one and explain that the water polo team had a match, or the rowing team had a regatta on those days. After about a month or two of this back and forth, they finally gave up."" —u/viking042900 ""By the time my mother received the letter, the mess had been put away, but they decided to get her on a few other complaints such as the bikes against the side of the house and the 'patchy' gravel. She had two weeks to have everything up to standards. ""Petty and easily frustrated, my mother knew immediately who called since the couple had come over and told her flat out with their renovations they were selling that house for 'way more than any other house in this neighborhood' and would appreciate if she respected that by keeping her property on par. ""For the next two weeks, every box from that garage was in our driveway. The couch and the living room TV came next. This was early summer, so it was perfect weather to sit in your yard in your short shorts and sports bra. My mom made sure to wave and smile every time they brought someone over for a showing."" —u/jumboface ""The theme he chose was Christmas in Paradise; he sold it to the association by saying it would be bright colors to off-set the dreary winter we were having. They enthusiastically approved it; they had no idea. ""He found some plastic palm trees, borrowed nine of a friend's pink flamingos, and built a sled for Santa. The flamingos had reindeer antlers, and the one in front had a red nose stuck on. The reins for his flamingos were lights not bells. He also had lights on the house, fake palms, and a sign that said Christmas in Paradise. The HOA couldn't do anything."" —u/naranghim ""The street parking rule is just the beginning of a long list of restrictions including one warranting a hefty fine for 'leaving the garage door open when not in use.' ""This came as a huge surprise since several of my neighbors have parked their cars on the street without problems since I've lived here, so I assumed it was okay. I can only imagine that they've singled me out because my car is 30 years old; however, in my defense, it's very presentable and by no means junky. ""Being singled out made me incredibly frustrated to the point where I started doing legal research. It turns out my HOA has every right to tow my project car since it's parked on a private street in the neighborhood. The good news for me is that the street just outside of the neighborhood is public, and it's 100% legal to park on it for any amount of time. ""Unfortunately for the HOA, the closest section of public street to my rental house is right in front of their nice gated entrance. Ironically, my old BMW has now become part of their image, and there's nothing they can do about it until I move out in a few months."" —u/wrassehole ""When they passed this rule, I was livid. I realized that they never mentioned which holidays we could decorate for, so the first thing I did was go out and buy red, white, and blue lights. I decorated for the 4th of July, and you better believe I left those annoying lights up until July 19. ""Problem is there really aren't major holidays from July on until October. BUT the HOA did not say it had to be a major holiday. After July 19, I decorated for International Beer Day, which was on August 4, with the same red, white, and blue lights up for the 4th of July, but I removed the sign that said 'Happy Independence Day' and replaced it with a sign I made myself that read 'Happy International Beer Day.' ""On August 19, I changed the sign to Happy National Aviation Day. I kept the same lights up though. Next was Labor Day. Yep. Just changed the sign again. On September 19, I started celebrating Rosh Hashanah. Because again, they never indicated which holidays we could decorate for. ""I kept this up over the holidays where I started with Veteran's Day after Halloween, and then went to Thanksgiving and Hanukkah. ""The board met and tried to pass a rule saying which holidays we could decorate for, BUT they couldn't get the vote when they tried to just include New Years, Valentine's Day, 4th of July, Halloween, and Christmas. They didn't include any Jewish Holidays or any other non-Christian holidays like Ramadan, and a lot of people voiced their displeasure with that. ""So they are going to meet again, and I think they are just going to change the rule to make decorations come down for the holidays in a reasonable time and not put restrictions on when we can start."" —u/jaxmagicman ""I call in and ask why I got the notice. The full description says, 'Bins in driveway with lids off.' I asked if this happened to be a Tuesday, and sure enough, it was. Wednesday is pickup, and I was doing my weekly cleaning. I was fucking using them, I calmly explained through gritted teeth. ""'Oh okay, I’ll remove the notice.' Great, but how do I prevent this from happening again? 'Oh, uh....I guess notify us.'  ""'Alright', I said, 'I’ll notify you every time I’m using my trash cans.'  ""'Oh that won’t be necessary....' Clearly, it is. ""That was five Tuesdays ago.

They were furious with him, and he laughed his ass off."" —u/procrastinator3000v2 ""Here's where the malicious compliance comes in. In our neighborhood, the roads are public, not private. We did a bit of research and found out that in our area, on public roads, a vehicle can be parked for one WEEK before it needs to move. So, we do the reasonable thing and park our huge RV in front of the house of the head of our HOA. For a week. And then we move it a few dozen feet, and leave it another week. And then go on our trip. ""We never heard about it from the HOA, presumably because they realized they have no control on public streets.

5/9/2022,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Berlin criminal investigators and prosecutors were on Saturday studying a device found and destroyed at a residential building housing Russian news agency staff in the city's Steglitz district, Berlin authorities said. The device was found on Friday and investigators were looking into how dangerous it had been and who it was aimed at, a Berlin police spokesman said in response to an enquiry in the morning. A statement issued jointly by the police and the city state's prosecutor in the afternoon said the possible motivation behind placing the device was now subject of investigation by the department of state security at Berlin's state criminal police office and the prosecutor's office. It identified the building as being in Lepsius street in the south-western district of Berlin. Russia's embassy in Berlin said a bottle had been thrown through a window of the apartment block on Friday evening, and that an improvised bomb had been found in the subsequent search, which it said German sappers had identified and deactivated. The Russian state-run RIA news agency said it had journalists living in the block. Russia's foreign ministry demanded on Saturday that authorities in Germany and other European Union and NATO states take steps to protect Russian journalists and their families abroad. ""We see this as a direct consequence of the harassment of Russia media and their employees unleashed in the West,"" its statement said. ""The politicised decision to disconnect Russian media from the airwaves in the European Union was the precursor to their physical intimidation, right up to their elimination."" Video footage broadcast by RIA on Friday evening showed a cordoned-off street and a person in a protective suit, which the agency said was one of the sappers working to defuse the bomb. Various Russian broadcasters have been banned in Western countries after being accused of spreading propaganda in connection with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" to disarm the country and protect it from fascists. Ukraine and the West say the fascist allegation is baseless and that the war is an unprovoked act of aggression. State-controlled Russian outlets RT and Sputnik were banned throughout the European Union on March 2. ""Systematic information manipulation and disinformation by the Kremlin is applied as an operational tool in its assault on Ukraine,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said at the time.

5/9/2022,"A New Jersey couple was kicked off a JetBlue flight and escorted out of the airport last Sunday, per reports. A viral video shows the couple using a homophobic slur and ranting at flight attendants and passengers. In the footage, the couple claims they are being kicked off for supporting former President Donald Trump. A New Jersey couple was kicked off a JetBlue flight last Sunday after hurling a homophobic slur at passengers and ranting about everything from China to Elon Musk, according to reports. The woman, identified by the Daily Beast as former Broadway dancer Madeleine Kelly, was escorted off the flight with her husband — known only as ""Gene."" The couple, who described themselves in the video as Trump supporters, was then removed from West Palm Beach airport by law enforcement officers on Sunday afternoon, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, per the Daily Beast. Video footage of the incident, shared on TikTok and Reddit, shows Kelly gesticulating as she confronts a JetBlue flight attendant. It is unclear what started the heated discussion, but Kelly can be heard ranting to a flight attendant about free speech at the start of the clip. ""You guys see what's happening in America,"" Kelly says in the video. ""He didn't like what he said, and now we're getting kicked off a plane."" She continues, ""You guys, we're going to turn in China. It's coming. Sheep, sheep, sheep, baaah."" Kelly then moves on to the issue of mask-wearing and praising Elon Musk, the video shows. ""Oh, I love Elon Musk. He is the best,"" Kelly says of the Tesla billionaire who recently bought Twitter. ""Elon! He is the fucking king!"" she adds She then threatens to sue a passenger and the airline before mentioning that she used to dance on Broadway. According to a review in The New York Times, Kelly was the director-choreographer of the 2007 musical ""The Glorious Ones."" Kelly's husband can then be heard using the homophobic F-slur, which he repeats several times in the video. In the video, Kelly, who says it's her and Gene's anniversary, can be seen buckling her husband's seatbelt after a flight attendant tries to remove them from the flight. Kelly repeatedly asks why they are being kicked off the plane. ""We've got to get off the plane because we're Trump supporters,"" she says. ""Seriously, I really think that's what it is."" Towards the end of the clip, she tells a passenger, who appears to be recording the incident, to put it on YouTube. No charges were filed against the couple, the Daily Beast said, citing local officials. JetBlue did not respond to Insider's request for comment on Friday morning.

5/9/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia's most senior lawmaker on Saturday accused Washington of coordinating military operations in Ukraine, which he said amounted to direct U.S. involvement in military action against Russia. ""Washington is essentially coordinating and developing military operations, thereby directly participating in military actions against our country,"" Vyacheslav Volodin wrote on his Telegram channel. Washington and European members of the transatlantic NATO alliance have supplied Kyiv with heavy weapons to help it resist a Russian offensive that has resulted in the occupation of parts of eastern and southern Ukraine but failed to take Kyiv. However, the United States and its NATO allies have repeatedly said they will not take part in fighting themselves, in order to avoid becoming parties to the conflict. U.S. officials have said the United States has provided intelligence to Ukraine to help counter the Russian assault, but have denied that this intelligence includes precise targeting data. Volodin, speaker of the lower house of parliament, the Duma, is a prominent advocate of what Moscow calls its ""special operation"" in Ukraine to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out what it calls fascist elements holding sway over the government and military. Ukraine and the West say the fascist allegation is baseless, and that Russia has carried out an unprovoked act of aggression. The conflict has killed thousands in Ukraine, and more than five million people have fled the country. Volodin said foreign advisers had been working in Ukraine since what he called the ""coup d'etat"", in an apparent reference to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's democratic election in 2019.

5/9/2022,"“Why is it acceptable in your state to force girls who are victims of incest to carry those children to term?” CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves, whose state has a trigger law set to ban abortion immediately if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. That law, also called a “snapback law,” does not include an exception allowing victims of incest to access abortion care. The only exceptions in the law are for cases of rape and when the life of the mother is in danger. When asked on Sunday whether Mississippi would enforce the snapback law if Roe is overturned — which looks increasingly likely thanks to a leaked draft opinion — Reeves told Tapper he would. “Yes, Mississippi does have a trigger law in place,” Reeves said. “It was passed in 2007, and that trigger law will go into effect” if Roe is overturned. Pro-choice governor Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan, on the other hand, has gone to court in an attempt to prevent the state’s trigger law from going into effect if the Supreme Court nullifies Roe.

Now He Labels Peaceful Pro-Choice Protesters 'Mob Violence' Inside the Fight to Make Abortions-by-Mail Possible -- No Matter Which State You Live In Louisiana Moves to Charge Women Who Get Abortions With Murder When Tapper asked Reeves to “explain why” there are no exceptions in Mississippi’s trigger law, the Republican governor glibly replied, “Well, that’s gonna be the law because in 2007 the Mississippi legislature passed it.” Reeves defended not having an exception for incest written into the 2007 legislation. “When you look at the number of [abortions] that actually involve incest, it’s less than 1 percent,” he said. But Tapper pressed Reeves further on the lack of exceptions in the state’s law. “Let me ask you, what about a fetus that has serious or fatal abnormalities that will not allow that fetus to live outside the womb? Is the state of Mississippi going to force those girls and women who have this tragedy inside them to carry the child to term? Are you going to force them to do that?” Reeves continued to duck the pointed questions, again falling back on the argument that only a “very small” percent of abortions would be affected by the lack of exceptions, as if that somehow erases the problem created by the law or minimizes the potential trauma women would experience. Reeves also touted his state’s pregnancy resource centers as equipped to help expectant mothers. But as sociologist Katrina Kimport, who has studied these centers in depth, told The New York Times, they are “inadequate” because “the scale of need far exceeds what the centers were able to provide.” “We’re talking about prenatal vitamins, and they don’t have stable housing,” said Kimport, an associate professor with Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health at the University of California, San Francisco. Tapper also pointed out to Reeves that his state has a very poor history of caring for parents and their children. “Mississippi, as you know, has the highest rate of infant mortality in the United States,” he said. “You have the highest rate of child poverty in the United States. Your state has no guaranteed maternity leave that’s paid. The legislature in Mississippi just rejected extending postpartum Medicaid coverage. Your foster care system is also the subject of a long-running federal lawsuit over its failure to protect children from abuse.” Tapper continued, “You say you want to do more to support mothers and children. But you have been in state government since 2004. You were the state treasurer. Then you were the lieutenant governor. Now you’re the governor, Based on the track record of the state of Mississippi, why should any of these girls or moms believe you?” Reeves admitted his state has “a long history of poor health outcomes” but danced around the question, making vague promises that he is “focusing every day on fixing the challenges that are before us” and talking condescendingly about “educational opportunities” and “jobs” (as if education and jobs will fix entrenched child poverty, as if child care in America is not prohibitively expensive for many working moms). Later, Tapper asked Reeves if his state would “target IUDs or Plan B,” which are forms of contraceptives. Again, Reeves dodged the question while refusing to close the door on a possible contraception ban. “That is not what we’re focused on at this time,” he said. “We’re focused on… what the court allows for. The bill that is before the court is a 15-week ban. We believe that the overturning of Roe is the correct decision by the court.” Reeves’ interview was followed by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. The Democrat, responding to what Reeves said, called him “quite paternalistic towards women.” “He indicated during your conversation that all we need is more education for women,” Gillibrand said. “I was pretty offended by his remarks. He doesn’t look at women as full citizens. He’s taken away their right to make these fundamental decisions about when they’re having children, under what circumstances they’re having children, how many children they’re having, at what point in their life they’re having children.” She continued, “It’s outrageous that this governor and governors and legislatures across America are going to take this draft opinion, when it is final, and deny women these fundamental life-and-death decisions about their future and about their families.” Best of Rolling Stone The Useful Idiots New Guide to the Most Stoned Moments of the 2020 Presidential Campaign Anatomy of a Fake News Scandal The Radical Crusade of Mike Pence Click here to read the full article.

5/9/2022,"By Jonathan Landay FASTIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - A salvo of missiles brought the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine to Fastiv, a quiet town abounding with flowering cherry trees and set in sweeping farmland hundreds of kilometres from the front lines. The strike on April 28, which injured two people, hit an electrical substation that feeds power to a confluence of railway lines that forms a key hub of networks linking central Europe, Russia, and Asia. The damage quickly was repaired, said Ukrainian officials, and a Reuters visit last week revealed no lingering impact. Trains plied between Kyiv and the southern port of Odesa, disgorging passengers into the station at Fastiv, a town of 45,000 people 75 km (45 miles) south of the capital. Officials said the attack was part of an escalating Russian assault on infrastructure, aimed in part at paralyzing rail deliveries of Western-supplied arms and also reinforcements sustaining Ukrainian forces fighting in the east and south. So far, Moscow's effort has failed, making state-owned Ukrainian Railways a leading symbol of the country's resilience. ""The longest delay we’ve had has been less than an hour,"" said Oleksandr Kamyshin, 37, a former investment banker who keeps the trains running as the CEO of the railways, Ukraine's largest employer. “They haven’t hit a single military train."" The Russian defense ministry has said Ukrainian facilities powering the railways have been targeted by missile strikes because trains are used to deliver foreign arms to Ukrainian forces. The rail system is being hit not just because it is critical to military supplies, Ukrainian officials said. Moscow's ""goal is to destroy critical infrastructure as much as possible for military, economic and social reasons,"" Deputy Infrastructure Minister Yuri Vaskov said in an interview. With Russian warships blockading Black Sea ports, downed bridges and checkpoints obstructing roadways, and a fuel crunch snarling trucking, Ukraine’s 22,000 km (14,000 miles) of track are the main lifeline of the struggling economy and a passage to the outside world. Trains have evacuated millions of civilians fleeing to safer parts of the country or abroad. They have begun running small grain shipments to neighboring counties to circumvent Russia's maritime blockade. Ukraine was the world’s fourth largest grain exporter in the 2020/21 season and exports disrupted by the war have interrupted global food chains and helped fuel worldwide inflation. Internally, trains are distributing humanitarian aid and other cargoes. They enabled the restart of the AcelorMittal steel plant, in Kryvyi Rih, by bringing workers in and product out, said Kamyshin. They carry civilian casualties in hospital cars staffed by Doctors Without Borders. Since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, he said, trains have distributed more than 140,000 tonnes of food and will have carried some 1 million kilos of mail for the state postal service by mid-May. Russian attacks on some of the 1,000 stations have killed scores of civilians, including dozens killed in an attack in April in the station in the eastern city of Kramatorsk. That has not deterred passengers. Daily ridership has reached as many as 200,000 passengers, Kamyshin said in an interview on Saturday as he rode a train across a bridge that had been repaired after being badly damaged during Russia's failed advance on Kyiv from the suburb of Irpin. Nor have the railway’s 230,000 personnel stayed home even though 122 have been killed and 155 others wounded on the job and in their houses, said Kamyshin. Moscow denies striking civilian targets in what it calls a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and rid it of what it calls anti-Russian nationalism fomented by the West. Ukraine and the West say Russia launched an unprovoked war of aggression. Reuters was not able to independently verify the assertions of Kamyshin and other Ukrainian officials about their successes keeping the railways going in wartime. UKRAINE'S 'LIFELIFE' Helena Muskrivska, 56, the Irpin station master, said she worked for the first four days of the Russian assault, helping evacuate some 1,000 people and relaying local developments by landline to Kyiv. She took documents and equipment home when it became too dangerous. “I was here when the Russians came into the station. I didn’t want to see them face to face,” said Muskrivska. A group of current and former U.S. and European railway executives formed the International Support Ukraine Rail Task Force in March to raise money for protective gear, first aid kits and financial aid for railway staff. “There's a lot of fundraising efforts everywhere for Ukraine, but none of it goes to the railroad,” said Jolene Molitoris, a former U.S. Federal Railroad Administration chief who chairs the group. “It is the lifeline of the country.” The group also aims to fund purchases of heavy machinery, rails and other equipment sought by the railways. Kamyshin said he is racing against the Russian attacks, deploying teams of workers and dispatchers around the clock to fix tracks and reroute trains. “It’s all about hours, not about days.” He and top aides constantly move, taking trains to inspect damage and repairs around Ukraine, he said, adding: ""Once they break it, we fix it"". Kamyshin said his top priority is redirecting grain exports from Ukraine’s southern ports to Poland, Romania, and the Baltic states to help revive the economy. He said Russia would remain a threat even after what he called its inevitable defeat. “This crazy neighbor will stay with us,” he said. “No one knows when they will come again.” (Additional reporting by Pavel Polityuk; Editing by Frances Kerry)",World/Reuters,Russian attacks on rail system fail to paralyze 'lifeline of Ukraine',https://news.yahoo.com/russian-attacks-rail-system-fail-184943836.html
