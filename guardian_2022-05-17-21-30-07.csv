5/17/2022,"For all that Henry Arundell’s first call-up to the England squad commands attention, for all that Eddie Jones has seen fit to cast his eye over another tranche of youngsters just a year before the World Cup campaign begins, the most significant inclusion for Sunday’s get-together is Manu Tuilagi. Twas ever thus and it is no coincidence that the night before naming his squad, Jones chose to spend it in Manchester visiting Tuilagi, not the returning Owen Farrell nor any members of his leadership group. The excitement around Arundell is understandable even beyond the fact that eye-catching young players will always generate hype. At first glance he looks barely out of short trousers – as someone with better insight than most recently explained, he is all bottom half at the moment – but his try-scoring exploits in recent weeks have been explosive and Jones has been clear that he wants to inject pace in his side between now and France 2023. Equally, the selections of Will Joseph, Jack Willis and Jack van Poortvliet, who is among the 10 uncapped faces, add a layer of intrigue; so too does the list of names of players missing, including Henry Slade, George Ford and Joe Marler, though it has been made clear that they have been rested as opposed to dropped. But it is important to remember that while the three-day camp marks the start of England’s preparations for the three-Test tour of Australia this summer and there will be some training on the paddock, it will be largely limited to admin and MOT fitness checks. They call it “alignment”; perhaps it will give Jones the chance to formulate plans for the uncapped Barbarians match on 19 June, but in truth his plans for the summer will become much clearer in the coming weeks. Tuilagi’s presence, however, cannot be ignored. It can never be ignored because it has not happened nearly regularly enough during Jones’s tenure, with the 30-year-old most recently missing the Six Nations. Barring the 2019 World Cup campaign, in which England’s backroom staff worked wonders to keep him fit and firing in the warmups and through the tournament, Tuilagi has made only 13 appearances under the Australian. Just two of those came before 2019 and in that time Jones used to make a habit of dismissing questions about him, seemingly attempting to ensure his spectre did not loom large over the squad. With Jones departing after next year’s World Cup, however, there is no need for such pretence, rather an acceptance that there is no substitute for someone of Tuilagi’s unique ability. It is thought that Northampton’s Tommy Freeman is seen as a potential centre, Paolo Odogwu was also earmarked for that role during his brief involvement, but since Ben Te’o was jettisoned in the summer of 2019 Tuilagi’s absence has always meant for a makeshift backline. There is little doubting, however, that the dream midfield Jones so desires is to combine Marcus Smith and Owen Farrell in the 10-12 axis and having Tuilagi rampaging outside them. “I caught up with Manu last night in Manchester. He was looking very fit and enthusiastic,” said Jones, optimistically. “He really wants to make an imprint on this Australian tour.” Jones wants a tenacious scrum-half too, so it is a shame that Raffi Quirke will miss the Australia tour through injury, but the door is open for Van Poortvliet to establish himself. Elsewhere, there is no shifting Freddie Steward from the full-back jersey, regardless of the excitement surrounding Arundell. Indeed, Arundell may be more likely to feature on the wing where Jones has also turned to Anthony Watson who is a bit closer to a comeback following a long-term injury than Jonny May. That those two – plus Jack Nowell – were among Jones’s go-to wingers when he first took over says a lot about his views on the emerging talent in the Premiership but he has always wanted one winger with express pace and it seems Max Malins, who it should be said has a hamstring injury, is now on the outside looking in as a result. Joe Cokanasiga’s place in the squad is significant because he tends to be included whenever he is fit, which hasn’t happened very often over the last couple of years. But for all the talk of Jones and his coaches seeking unpredictability in attack – finding a ruthless finishing streak and a fluidity that renders numbers on jerseys largely redundant – it is a simple approach that will make England prosper and Tuilagi is at the heart of it. How Farrell beds back into the squad will be fascinating and Jones has deferred his decision over the captaincy, but make no mistake, England need Tuilagi in their midfield regardless of who plays either side of him. “It’s all about finding out what’s right for [Manu]. He’s slowly learning what he needs to do – the Sale staff have been fantastic and the [England] staff will work with them together to make sure we put him in the best position so he can play as many games as possible.” In the pack, Jones still needs to settle on a second-row partner for Maro Itoje – Jonny Hill’s injury-enforced absence does not help in that regard – and a No8, where neither Alex Dombrandt nor Sam Simmonds, another who is currently sidelined, have yet truly seized their opportunity. Alfie Barbeary would be a popular choice and though he is part of the training squad, maybe he will come to regret moving away from hooker. First things first, however, Jones needs to get the disappointment of the Six Nations out of his and the squad’s system and, true to form, what better way to do that than a camp, however brief, working with fresh, enthusiastic faces. Whether it greatly impacts on his thinking for the Australia tour is unclear but it at least marks the start of the next chapter and Jones will be grateful for that. “Playstation rugby,” was the eloquent and equally apt phrase used in the French media to describe Leinster’s performance against Toulouse and it must be said it was an emphatic statement of intent from the four-times winners. Plenty has been said about how Ireland’s domestic setup is tailored for Leinster’s success on the continent, about how they started with 13 Test players in their side and the impact that Stuart Lancaster continues to make in Dublin. Above all, however, perhaps what set them apart against Toulouse was their hunger. There is little doubt that they are desperate to clinch the trophy again after four lean years, including a final defeat by Saracens. Toulouse were not at their best, having played 100 minutes the week before, but you cannot but wonder whether the fact that they ended their wait for title number five last season played some small part. It seems the theory that you need the heartache to drive that hunger rings true. Starting pistol fires on rugby’s defining decade but can it make it pay, asks Robert Kitson.

5/17/2022,"If you are facing a trial that could end up with you spending several years in prison, it is great to have a lawyer who is politically “on side”, has a wry sense of humour and a clear disdain for much of the legal and political establishment. So I was fortunate that the first time I was a defendant in a political trial, my solicitor – in his first high-profile political case – was William Nash. The 1974-75 case – involving 14 pacifists and anti-militarists facing conspiracy charges relating to the distribution of information to British soldiers telling them how they could leave the Army – ended up, thanks to the commitment of Bill and others, with defendants, solicitors and barristers working collectively as a team; and with political as well as legal considerations to the fore. Over the following years, Bill went on to do similar, and frequently similarly successful, sterling work for many of my friends and comrades.",News/Law,Letter: William Nash obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/may/17/letter-william-nash-obituary
5/17/2022,"As soon as the sun shows its nose in Britain, we want to be outside with a drink. Socks shrink, shoulders relax, park tennis courts teem with hopefuls counting down the days to Wimbledon, and we start pouring. You might presume this means alcohol. One recent baking hot week, in late March, Waitrose says it saw a 600% increase in searches for “summer cordial recipes”, compared with February. It also says that when Wimbledon was cancelled in 2020 (quashing Robinsons’ hopes of being the tournament’s official soft drink for the 85th summer in a row), households stockpiled all manner of squash for their homeschooled kids, as well as what the sector calls “premium dilutes” – cordials – for homeworking parents. Since the soft drinks industry levy in 2018, AKA the sugar tax, drinks manufacturers have been reducing the sugar content in these offerings, but that doesn’t mean we’re drinking any less of them. Supermarkets can barely keep up with demand. Waitrose is banking on the same almost 10% bump in sales for 2022 as it saw in 2021. “In all warm countries, this is what you need,” says Honey and Co’s Itamar Srulovich. “Something really cold and something really sweet.” Until recently, “premium dilutes” has basically meant cordial brands such as Belvoir Farm and Bottlegreen, and French sirops (Monin or Teisseire), which one Mumsnet user recently described as, “a bit like squash but much nicer”. How dilutes are sweetened is crucial to understanding their differences. In France, for something to be sold as a “sirop de fruit”, it has to contain at least 10% fruit juice (7% if it’s citrus) and at least 50% sweetener (sugar, dextrose, honey, fructose). Cordials, meanwhile, are often similarly sweetened, just less concentrated. Both syrups and cordials are meant to be diluted (which at its most basic means with water, still or sparkling) but where the ratio for cordial is generally 1:4 or 1:5, with syrups, it’s 1:7. Quite what a dilute can be though, in terms of flavour, has constellated of late into a frankly exhilarating array of possibilities. First up, cordials have been upgraded in both gustatory and climate-conscious ways. Ex-financial auditor Natasha Steele launched Urban Cordial in 2016 to fight food waste. She uses surplus fruit and veg (saving 120 tonnes to date) and the whole production process is zero-waste because the pulp leftover from making the juices goes to farms as animal feed. “It’s really good quality. It’s good for you. And it’s doing something good,” says Steele. “I think people want that.” Urban Cordial has had five Great Taste awards for unexpected flavour combinations. These include raspberry and rosemary; strawberry and sage; and apple, lemon and fennel. Of the last, one commenter said: “Not too sweet. A Goldilocks product. Just right.” West Country brand The Bristol Syrup Co numbers its flavours, which range from classic simple sugar syrups (for making highballs and whiskey sours) to pineapple and coconut syrups.Though these are destined primarily for the bar trade, when Covid got us all mixing cocktails at home, people started buying Bristol syrups for DIY drinking too. Steele says she has a recipe list on her website, but mostly only mixes her cordials with water. “I tend not to recommend anything too elaborate because you don’t want to move away from the flavour of the cordial.” Price and context are crucial here. Steele says that because her products are labelled as cordials, she can’t set the price too high (£6 per 500ml) because people just wouldn’t pay a high price for a cordial, whereas they will for a shrub (a vinegar-based, fruit-flavour syrup, often with added aromatics). And the Bristol Syrup Company’s business development manager, Greg Williams, says the same: the syrups are always mixed with something (you wouldn’t drink them neat). Mixologists will use them in cocktails. But much like French mint or grenadine sirop, they are good just with water too. Its passionfruit (number 5) is the bestseller, and the Disco grenadine (a newcomer, at number 19) is getting a lot of love for its 1970s flamboyance. “People have come up to me and said: ‘Look, we don’t really care what it tastes like, but it’s called Disco, so we’re going to buy it.’” A survey in December 2021 found that one in three British drinkers regularly orders low or no alcohol drinks, up from one in four in 2020. This trend has seen the low and no alcohol sector grow by 40% in the UK between 2019 and 2021. “Posh squash”, as a category, might not be quite what drinks purveyors are going for with their 0% spirits and soft shrub mixers, but to understand what you’re pouring, it’s not far off. Six years ago, after designing drinks for the Dishoom group of restaurants, UK mixologist Carl Anthony Brown tackled non-alcoholic spirits. Drinking, for him, has always been about flavour, and he found the options for anyone wanting to have a good time and not get drunk decidedly underwhelming. “Your choices were: water; tonic water – because that’s adult water, purely because of the bitterness of it; some kind of soft drink, cola or whatever; or a mocktail. And that word just makes me angry.” So he locked himself in a dark room with a notebook and all the alcoholic spirits he could think of, and got very drunk, noting how each felt, tasted and otherwise affected him – whether his cheeks were flushed or his mouth dry. He wanted to come up with a drink that would elicit a similarly multilayered experience for the drinker. As he puts it: “One of the best drinks in the world is Morrisons’ own brand peach cordial topped up with soda, but you can’t really do that in a bar. People would be like: ‘Sorry, you’re just using Morrisons’ own brand cordial and mixing it.’ They would not be happy.” To achieve the complexity of a proper cocktail, he worked backwards. Instead of attempting a soft version of any individual spirit, he started with the basic categories of drinks they are mixed into. He came up with three: citrussy (the Cosmopolitan, the G&T, the vodka lime and soda); bitter (aperitivos, digestives, Italian bitters); and smokey (anything with whisky, mezcal or aged rum). His versions take as their base, respectively, fresh citrus (mandarin, lemon, grapefruit, orange), hibiscus (with rhubarb and other floral notes), and lapsang souchong. And you mix them as you would a cocktail, with sodas, tonic water and the like. Just as cordials started out as Renaissance medicinal liquors, held to be guardians of health, so many of these new drinks are, in fact, old ideas. Shrubs are a case in point, stemming mostly from the Mesopotamian/Persian sharbat tradition. Henry Chevallier Guild and his brother Barry were the eighth generation of their Suffolk family to own and run Aspall cyder and vinegar makers, before they sold up in 2018. Nonsuch shrubs were born of this tradition. Where a cordial or squash has added sugar and water, these shrubs are made from vinegar and fruit alone. Flavours include blood orange and bitter lemon; wild hedgerow and rose; and bittersweet apple and cardamom. “What I love about them is that they are not trying to be something else,” says Chevallier Guild. “The vinegar adds the balance while the botanicals carry flavour and offer a savoury element.” You end up with, he says, something genuinely interesting. You can also get a Cornish shrub, now bottled in small batches by Sevenstones. Its recipe is based on one found in Elizabeth Moxon’s English Housewifery from 1741, and contains an ingredients list as evocative as the origin story of the Cornish shrub itself: sugar cane, rock samphire, honey, orange blossom, orange peel, orange juice, lemon peel, lemon juice, cinnamon, cassia, cardamom, cloves, bay, cordiander, rosehips, allspice and fennel. It is said that barrels of rum would be sunk in the sea to avoid customs, and when the salt water spoiled the contents, a shrub (made using 500 oranges per barrel!) would be added to make it drinkable. From Robinsons’ octogenarian affair with British tennis to smugglers spiking rum with sea salt and citrus, the beauty of these drinks isn’t just their sweetness, it’s their romance.

5/17/2022,"Before diving in at a dinner party, my friend Lizzie always makes a point of asking the host to describe each dish they’ve made. It’s a way of acknowledging their efforts – but, according to food psychology, she could also be helping herself and her fellow diners eat better by making them more mindful of their meal. Charles Spence is a professor of experimental psychology at Oxford University, who researches the factors that influence what we choose to eat and what we think about the experience. His research highlights the extent to which those choices are shaped by the ways in which we engage with our food; in short, what our meals look and smell like, whether we eat them with forks or fingers – even the music we’re listening to while eating or food shopping can all play a role in how healthily we eat. The following techniques will help you “trick” your brain into making better decisions for your body. Many of us now know that serving meals on a smaller plate can control how much we eat, because our brains believe there to be more food there than there actually is. This has a profound effect on satiety (how full you feel), yet the brain can also be fooled by the tools we use: heavier cutlery enhances our appreciation of it, as does eating with our hands, which engages our senses and makes us more mindful. “With a fork, you don’t have to think about it,” says Spence. He cites the example of chef Andoni Aduriz of the world-famous Mugaritz restaurant in Errenteria, northern Spain, who has taken cutlery away for all courses in order to make people “think more about how they interact with their food”. “Anything you can do to pay more attention and eat more slowly, to be more mindful in the moment, will likely enhance the sensations associated with eating and mean that you are satisfied with less,” says Spence. Not only will this affect satiety, it could also help you make healthier choices – and enjoy those choices more. “If it’s true that 75%-95% of what we taste, we really smell, then the aroma is really important. Yet many of our food behaviours are not optimised for that. If you’re drinking coffee from a takeaway cup with a lid, you’re missing a key part of the experience,” he says – one which would be enhanced by smelling the aroma wafting out of a beautiful mug while cupping your hands around it. Enjoy your first coffee like that, and perhaps you won’t feel so tempted by a second. This example also highlights the role touch can play in satiety and satisfaction. Spence believes one of the reasons behind the rising popularity of bowl food in recent years is that you can pick it up and bring it closer to you: “Feeling its weight and warmth, breathing in the scent – it helps to maximise the multisensory experience.” As Roman gourmand Apicius famously noted – and food psychologists have since proven – we eat first with our eyes, and that dictates much of our experience. Indeed, by shaping our expectations, the appearance of foods has even been shown to influence what we taste when we eat them; so a big, beautiful salad boasting a variety of leaves and colours and textures won’t just look better than a handful of spinach; it will taste better, too. We should also remember that we eat with our eyes when it comes to premade food, Spence says – particularly when it’s something asymmetrical (or without a uniform appearance). For all the heated discussion about which way round to eat a chocolate digestive – to flip or not to flip – it seems eating it chocolate side up maximises our sensory experience, because it is the energy-dense, chocolatey top our brains find so appealing. There’s a reason the first bite of a chocolate bar tastes better than subsequent bites; the first bite is novel, then our tastebuds become habituated. “Even when the flavour of each bite or slurp is slightly different, if it looks the same our brain tends to assume that the taste also remains the same,” Spence says. The flipside of that is that we can use this reaction to our advantage and reduce the quantity of unhealthy food we consume by packing as much of it as possible into that first mouthful. This is harder to do at home but it is coming into play in the design of readymade foods. “Some companies are now designing foods with asymmetric ingredients,” says Spence: for example, at Unilever Research, readymade lasagnes are made with salt sprinkled on alternate layers. “A lot of the literature in sensory marketing shows that you can change people’s food choices with music,” says Spence. For example, people will drink about 30% more if the music is fast and loud. There is emerging evidence to suggest loud noises trigger less healthy food behaviours – “which might be because there’s so much noise, you can’t really taste what you’re eating”. Genre matters too: listening to jazz and classical music increases people’s preferences for healthy savoury foods more than American rock, for example, which leads us more towards burger and chips; something to bear in mind if you’re listening to music while shopping. Spence is increasingly interested in whether the sounds of nature can influence our decision to make healthier food choices; ina study by Portuguese researchers, a supermarket played the sound of the sea near the fish counter and fish sales rose dramatically. “We know being exposed to nature is good for mental wellbeing, and I can’t help but wonder if playing these soundscapes harnesses that.” It is true that we tend to eat more in the company of others – “but one doesn’t want to recommend eating alone,” says Spence – at least, not habitually. There are ways to enhance the sensory experience of a communal meal and encourage diners to focus on the food as well as the conversation. One is to get people involved in the process: serving up in dishes so they can help themselves or encouraging them to customise their plate with, say, herbs or seasonings. “It elicits the so-called Ikea effect. They feel ownership for what they’re eating.” Multiple courses, rather than one big spread, also creates “hooks for memory” – and, helpfully, slows people down. Finally, Spence agrees with my friend Lizzie. “It strikes me how often you go to people’s houses, and they’ve made food, and we don’t discuss it; and how nice it would be if they were to describe, say, the carrots as zingy.” When it comes to eating more mindfully, there’s a lot to be said for simply talking about the food more.",Lifestyle/Life and style,How to trick your brain into better eating habits,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/17/how-to-trick-your-brain-into-better-eating-habits
5/17/2022,"Amnesty International has called on the US government to fully restore tribal jurisdiction over crimes on Native lands in the face of staggeringly high rates of sexual violence against Native women, according to a report released on Tuesday. Nearly one in three American Indian and Alaska Native women have been raped – more than twice the average for white women and probably an undercount given gaps in data collection, according to the report. These high numbers, the authors explained, result from the US government stripping tribal nations of their authority, followed by a “complex jurisdictional maze” that, depending on whether the survivor and perpetrator are Native and the location and severity of the crime, could place responsibility in the hands of tribal, state or federal authorities. “You have then people who survive an assault, they have police show up who are then arguing on their doorstep who has to take this, who doesn’t want it, who’s responsibility it is, whose [it] isn’t,” said Tarah Demant, the report lead. The 98-page report came 15 years after Amnesty International published a study on the crisis of sexual violence against Native women. Demant said it was rare for the organization to revisit an issue in this way. But after seeing no significant decrease in these crimes despite a series of related federal policies viewed as huge steps toward rectifying the situation, she said it was clear they needed to reinvestigate. There was the 2010 Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA), which allows tribal courts to sentence people to up to three years’ imprisonment. There was also the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which was recently reauthorized and is expected to make it possible for some nations to prosecute non-Native perpetrators of sexual violence. Although TLOA had some positive effects on women’s safety, it still only allows for limited sentencing and the requirements to implement it are “onerous”, according to the report. As of October 2021, only 16 tribes had implemented it. At the same time, many tribes don’t have the needed funding to be able to move forward with prosecutions under VAWA, according to the report. “All these half measures are Band-Aids on a tumor,” said Demant. “The tumor here is that the United States has stripped tribal governments of their sovereignty and their authority and their ability to protect their populations and prevent this type of violence.” Growing up on the White Earth reservation and in neighboring towns in Minnesota, Lisa Brunner remembers her mother’s husband, who was not a member of the tribe, beating and sexually assaulting her mother. When they called the police, he would sometimes be put in jail for the night and they occasionally would be brought to a shelter. But soon, the pattern would simply start all over again. So, she said, when she was raped at 15 and then again at 16, she didn’t bother calling the police. “I knew that law enforcement wouldn’t do anything, because I watched how they did nothing to the beatings that this man – coward, I should say – did to my mother,” said Brunner, who is now 49, and has spent decades working in the domestic violence and sexual assault field. Years later, she had her own daughter and said she had to help her navigate a similar situation when, at 17 years old, she was raped by a white man about five blocks from their home on the reservation. This time, Brunner said she reported it to a sexual assault investigator for the tribe. But in the 10 years since, she said she hasn’t heard anything from law enforcement officials. In the report, Amnesty International urged Congress to take broader steps to address the sexual assault epidemic, including overriding the supreme court’s 1978 Oliphant v Suquamish decision, which established that Native courts do not have criminal jurisdiction over non-tribal citizens. Amnesty also pushed for amending the Indian Civil Rights Act to give Native nations broader sentencing power. The authors also detailed how the high number of sexual assaults has been exacerbated by the US government under-resourcing tribal police, healthcare and other support services. While the national average is one law enforcement officer for every 286 people, on Native lands the average is one officer for 524 people, according to the report. At the same time, “of the 650 census-designated Native American lands analyzed in 2014, only 30.7% of the land was within an hour’s drive of a facility offering sexual assault examination services,” the authors wrote. Demant said the federal government “has obligations because of their actions and attempted elimination of Indigenous people … through that trust responsibility”. Tami Truett Jerue, executive director of the Alaska Native Women’s Resource Center, who helped with the report, said having sovereignty over these issues is a “good final step”. But, she said, “there’s a lot of things that have to happen in the meantime.” In Alaska, which has some of the highest rates of sexual assault against Indigenous women in the country, Jerue, a tribal member of Anvik village, said nations would need to have control over such things as rape kits and be able to readily provide counseling, including more traditional methods with elders. Rachel Carr-Shunk, executive director of Uniting Three Fires Against Violence in Michigan, a tribal domestic violence and sexual assault coalition, who also helped with the report, said it was important that the response to local problems were local, tribal solutions. Handing off cases to the FBI and the US attorney’s office, who, she said, may be several hours away and offer little communication and accountability, can be extremely detrimental. She gave the example of a woman who had been sexually assaulted on Native trust land in Michigan several years ago, and whose case was taken up by the FBI. But after about 18 months of delays, Carr-Shunk said the woman eventually couldn’t bring herself to continue with the process and so the charges were dismissed. Carr-Shunk, an enrolled member of the Sault Ste Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, asked: “How is that justice for that survivor?” Ultimately, Demant said, sexual violence against Indigenous women is a human rights crisis, one that the entire US government needs to come together to address. She said: “The US government is obligated by its international human rights law obligations, and frankly its own treaties here in the United States with tribes, to do more to actually solve this problem.”",News/World news,"‘Jurisdictional maze’ hinders investigation of sexual violence against Native women, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/17/sexual-violence-against-native-indigenous-women
5/17/2022,"Carl Theodor Dreyer’s macabre gothic romance from 1932 is now rereleased for its 90th anniversary. It’s an eerie, semi-silent classic which really does have the uncanny quality of a bad dream, in which event follows event with an unhurried somnambulist confidence. All early cinema, or maybe all cinema of any period, has that unspoken I-see-dead-people fascination: the spectacle of dead or forgotten actors revivified and brought back to undead life – and this is very appropriate for Vampyr. It’s a film which took as its starting point the stories of Sheridan Le Fanu, so predating Bram Stoker’s Dracula. It has a female vampire, and is thus very different from the male-centred satanic predator who was to become such a colossal horror-franchise player throughout the 20th century. This vampire, or vampyr, doesn’t yet have the elongated bicuspid-fangs, but the movie established some of the staples of vampire genre: the stake through the heart and the all-important dusty and mysterious central European tome, in German, which can reveal how to combat the vampires. The deeply strange story is about a traveller called Allan Gray, played with saucer-eyed intensity by the French socialite Baron Nicolas de Gunzburg, who co-produced the movie with Dreyer and appeared under the stage name “Julian West”. He is a devotee of necromantic learning and a visionary who, on taking a room at an inn in a French village called Courtempierre, finds himself visited (perhaps in a dream or hallucination) by a troubled elderly man whose daughter is being attacked by a female vampire and the vampire’s henchman, the village doctor. The young woman who has been bitten is called Léone, and now lies in a strange fever, having not yet entirely succumbed to the evil vampiric virus: she is played by Sybille Schmitz, whose own unhappy life and death inspired Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s 1982 film Veronika Voss. Dreyer’s closeups allow Léone’s disturbing face to fill the screen, gurning with an ambiguous ecstasy; it is like the clinical photograph of a psychiatric patient, or the subject of some Freudian case-history of hysteria as pure emotion, pure fear floods through her. And Gray witnesses phantoms: ethereal soldiers who are both remnants of the first world war and premonitions of the next. Vampyr’s most creepily inspired scene is Gray’s out-of-body experience in which he sees himself as one of the undead, lying glassy-eyed in a coffin which is actually fitted with a little window allowing him to see out – a truly hair-raising idea – and we get the corpse’s point-of-view of what he can see as the coffin is being carried to its resting place. Vampyr asks: what is it like to be dead? And answers: indistinguishable from being alive. This film is a unique experience.

5/17/2022,"Wayne Rooney asked Jamie Vardy if his wife could cut back on her media activities during the Euro 2016 football tournament because it was causing “distractions” for the England team, the high court has heard. Rooney told the “Wagatha Christie” libel trial that the then-England manager Roy Hodgson and assistant manager Gary Neville were both concerned that Rebekah Vardy’s decision to write a column for the Sun during the contest was disrupting the squad. Rooney said it was “awkward” that he had to have the chat with his fellow England striker, but the team’s management wanted to find a solution: “They asked me as captain to see if I could speak to Mr Vardy on issues regarding his wife. We all knew that it was an awkward subject so I needed to speak to Mr Vardy and ask him to speak to his wife – and ask him to ask his wife to calm down.” England’s record goalscorer was part of a squad that was unexpectedly knocked out of the tournament by Iceland. While preparing for one match, Rooney took time to speak to his fellow striker: “I remember the conversation I had with Jamie. It was a bit awkward for me to have to speak with a teammate regarding his wife. I sat down with Jamie Vardy and he had a coffee. It was such an awkward moment.” Leicester City’s Jamie Vardy, who has been training and playing for his Premier League club during the rest of the trial, turned up at the high court in central London for the first time. His wife, Rebekah, is suing fellow footballer’s wife Coleen Rooney for libel, after Coleen alleged Rebekah was passing stories from a private Instagram account to the Sun. The Vardys sat on the frontbench a metre apart from the Rooneys. The two women occasionally glanced sideways at each other, while their two husbands largely avoided eye contact. Rooney, now the manager of Derby County, told the court that England’s players attempted to relax in between Euro 2016 matches by playing pool and other games. During this time, Jamie Vardy would regularly be in the room talking to his wife: “Mrs Vardy was almost there with the team, she was on FaceTime a lot.” In a written witness statement, Rooney said Jamie Vardy agreed to speak to his wife about the way her media activity was causing a distraction during the tournament. Rooney said he was surprised to later learn that details of their private conversation were reported in the Sun. Rebekah Vardy had previously told the court that her husband denied ever having a conversation with Rooney about her media career causing distractions for the England team at Euro 2016. Rooney told the court the conversation definitely happened: “I 100% spoke to Mr Vardy about the situation. If he wants to relay that back to his wife, that is entirely his business.” Rooney said he would never have spoken to a journalist from the tabloid, as he was from Liverpool, where there is a longstanding boycott of the newspaper: “I never speak to a Sun journalist on a personal level.” He also expressed astonishment at the week-long libel trial, and said he did not read newspapers, and had been totally unaware that his wife was attempting to conduct a sting operation to catch the leaker from her private Instagram account. “Me sitting in this courtroom is the first time I’m hearing almost everything on this case,” he said. “This week is really the first time I’ve had any understanding of what happened.” Rooney said the lengthy legal proceedings brought by Vardy had changed his wife: “For me and my wife, we don’t want to be in this court in this situation. I’ve watched my wife over the last two and two-a-half-years really struggle with what’s going on. Become a different mother, a different wife. Hopefully, whatever the judgment is on this case, myself, my wife and our children can go on and live our lives.” Vardy is bringing the libel claim, arguing that while she did not leak stories to the Sun, it is possible that her former agent and close friend Caroline Watt may have done. Earlier in the day the court heard from the Rooneys’ agent Paul Stretford. In a witness statement he stated that the “rumours” in late 2019 were that Vardy had made a deal with her agent to take the blame. He said the speculation was that Vardy “would look after Caroline Watt behind the scenes in return for Caroline Watt publicly taking the blame for having leaked Coleen’s Instagram stories and posts to the Sun”. Vardy’s lawyers deny this version of events.

5/17/2022,"Women are almost twice as likely as men to become trapped in a motor vehicle after a crash and they also sustain different patterns of injury, data suggests. The research – the first large UK study to compare sex differences in injury patterns and the likelihood of becoming trapped after a collision – could help vehicle manufacturers improve car design and safety features to reduce rates of injury in both sexes. It also strengthens calls for the inclusion of more biologically accurate crash test dummies in simulations of vehicle collisions, to investigate their impact on women. Prof Tim Nutbeam, an emergency medicine consultant at University Hospitals Plymouth, and colleagues were motivated to carry out the study after reading Caroline Criado Perez’s bestselling book Invisible Women, which highlighted how women were more likely to be seriously injured in car crashes, because crash test dummies were modelled on the “average male”. To investigate, they looked at data from 70,027 patients admitted to major trauma centres and units in the UK between January 2012 and December 2019. They found that although men were more likely to be involved in serious crashes and admitted to hospital, 16% of women became trapped in the wreckage, versus only 9% of men. Women also sustained more hip and spinal injuries, whereas men suffered more head, face, chest and limb injuries. The research was published in BMJ Open. “I think the important bit is that it shows that women and men have different experiences of entrapment – that a trapped woman is not the same as a trapped man,” said Dr Lauren Weekes, a consultant anaesthetist at University Hospitals Plymouth, who was also involved in the study. “Understanding sex differences in injury patterns may help paramedics predict who is more likely to have certain injuries, which could have implications for how you help them out, and where you end up taking them. It may also help vehicle manufacturers direct safety systems to protect men and women equally.” One possibility is that the nature of women’s injuries makes it harder for them to escape the wreckage. “For example, women have a much higher rate of pelvic injury, and it’s harder to get yourself out of a car yourself if you’ve broken your pelvis,” Weekes said. Differences in the way men and women drive could also be a factor, with men involved in more frontal collisions, and more likely to be in the driver’s seat, compared with women, and therefore more likely to be injured by hitting the steering wheel or air bag. Also, if women are driving, they tend to have their seat positioned closer to the steering wheel, which could contribute to them becoming trapped. However, differences in body shape are also likely to come into play, and these are not accurately modelled in simulations of vehicle crashes. Weekes said: “We know that women’s pelvises, even correcting for height and weight, are much wider than men’s, so the crash test dummies used to simulate accidents are more like a 12-year-old prepubescent girl than an adult female. If you think about where a woman’s pelvis is likely to be in relation to the door, it is going to be closer. “Crash tests are standardised, and therefore the data from those should be able to protect men and women equally. But if manufacturers are not using biologically accurate dummies, how do they know that this is the case?” Criado Perez said she hoped the study would also put pressure on regulators to take the issue seriously: “The EU is currently in the process of introducing new legislation, which for the first time will say that female car occupants must be as protected as male occupants – but the UK is currently not intending to adopt this,” she said. “I really hope that this kind of research will focus the minds of those in government who have the power to ensure that women are no longer disproportionately and needlessly injured and killed in the event of a car crash.”",News/World news,"Women almost twice as likely to be trapped in crashed vehicle, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/17/women-almost-twice-likely-trapped-crashed-vehicle-study
5/17/2022,"Liz Truss has claimed the east-west relationship between Great Britain and Northern Ireland has been “undermined” by the Northern Ireland protocol, as she confirmed plans to table legislation that would scrap parts of the agreement. The foreign secretary, who is also responsible for Brexit, set out plans for the move in a statement in the House of Commons – though the bill is not expected to be published for some weeks. Truss said the government’s first priority was to uphold the Good Friday agreement, which she said was “under strain”. “The Northern Ireland protocol does not have the support necessary in one part of the community in Northern Ireland,” she said, referring to the Democratic Unionist party’s opposition. Citing issues such as the need for veterinary checks, and EU rules that prevented the Treasury from cutting taxes, she said: “These practical problems have contributed to the sense that the east-west relationship has been undermined,” adding: “We need to restore the balance in the agreement.” As expected, she proposed legislation that would create a “green channel” for goods going to Northern Ireland from Great Britain that will not go on to the Republic of Ireland, with mandatory checks halted for these exports. Goods moving onwards to the Republic would still face checks, via a “red channel”. It would involve a trusted trader scheme using “real-time commercial data”. Businesses would choose between UK and EU standards, in a “dual regulatory regime”. Earlier the prime minister’s official spokesperson said the legislation was aimed at resolving “serious and grave” problems with the protocol – not scrapping it altogether – and stressed negotiations with the EU would continue. He added there would be “robust penalties” for businesses failing to comply with the rules. Government sources are adamant the legislation would not breach international law, though have declined to discuss the details of legal advice provided to ministers by the attorney general, Suella Braverman.",News/Politics,"UK to table bill to scrap Northern Ireland Brexit protocol, Liz Truss says",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/17/northern-ireland-brexit-protocol-liz-truss-bill-scrap
5/17/2022,"Emo never dies: the fourth wave of the angsty rock subgenre began a decade ago and you could argue that now, with all the fretful pop-punk in the charts, we’re on to a fifth. So My Chemical Romance could not have timed their comeback better, making a new generation of fans as their original teenage audience ages into stadium rock. The band split after 12 years in March 2013, but remained beloved by the MySpace generation; tickets to a one-off reunion show in December 2019 sold out in minutes. Now, after several pandemic-related delays, MCR’s world tour gets under way in St Austell, Cornwall. The band have nearly a year on the road ahead of them, playing to stadiums of tens of thousands, so these two relatively intimate dates at the 6,500-capacity Eden Project allow them to ease into it. Fans are rapturous at the mere fact of a reunion, and any initial trepidation over how MCR might sound in 2022 seems to come from the stage: the band are somewhat stiff through the sombre opener The Foundations of Decay, which was released only days before the show. That choice seems too preemptive, given their well-loved back catalogue – a warning against expecting exactly the same band you loved back in 2004. But then they launch into Helena – emo’s ceremonial standard, and a defining video of millennials’ MTV – and the years melt away, with frontman Gerard Way’s swooping, heartfelt chorus echoed by the crowd. Though endearingly awkward with the audience, fretting about his overgrown fringe and asking the spotlight to be turned off him (“It makes me self-conscious”), Way is in command of the mic: spidery-fingered and snake-hipped, his emo scream is at full throttle. The setlist is split between their Queen-esque melodrama and fun thrash-y punk, with rowdy singalongs to Teenagers and Na Na Na, and ventures into camp on Mama and Vampire Money. Against a backdrop of an apocalyptic cityscape (and the Eden Project’s red-lit biomes), MCR fully commit to the world-building and sardonic humour that has seen their music age much better than many of their contemporaries. Predictably, the greatest enthusiasm from the crowd was reserved for songs from Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge and their beloved 2006 concept album The Black Parade, with Way seeming struck by the reverent response to Famous Last Words. MCR might now be elder statesmen of emo, but the inclusion of later material, plus the hint of a new project titled Swarm on the merchandise table, reiterate that this is not a legacy act cashing in on nostalgia, but a much-loved band re-entering the fray. Even Way seems surprised by the youthfulness of the crowd – this will have been the first gig for many pandemic-age teenagers. As the uplifting final call-and-response to I’m Not Okay (I Promise) affirms in the encore, The Black Parade marches on with new recruits.  At Stadium MK, Milton Keynes, 19, 21 and 22 May.

5/17/2022,"Welcome to Pushing Buttons, the Guardian’s gaming newsletter. If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email. Welcome back to Pushing Buttons! Yet again, some absolutely massive news in the gaming world happened just after the last issue hit your inboxes: EA Sports, which has been making Fifa-branded football games for nigh on three decades, has followed our columnist Dominik Diamond’s example and broken up with Fifa. Future football games from the developer, which has built a huge part of its fortune on Fifa’s $20bn in sales, will be called EA Sports FC, starting next year. Immediately I thought: ooh, this is going to be juicy. Has Fifa been spooked by the continuing governmental backlash against EA’s lootbox-fuelled Ultimate Team mode, which could ungenerously but not inaccurately be described as gambling-adjacent? Has there been drama brewing somewhere at the EA Sports studio in Vancouver, or Romania? There’s got to be a story here. Perhaps predictably, as this involves two of the richest and least popular corporate entities in their respective fields, the story that has emerged is actually about money. The New York Times reported last year that Fifa wanted to charge EA one billion dollars over four years for use of its name when the current licensing deal came to an end, and there were arguments over what that license would actually entail, in terms of exclusivity. Fifa wanted to cash in on other video game partnerships, too. The statement from Fifa president Gianni Infantino is hilarious. He seems to believe that in one year’s time, other developers will be able to create football video games that are just as good as the ones that EA has poured actual decades of technical expertise and research into. “I can assure you that the only authentic, real game that has the FIFA name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans. The FIFA name is the only global, original title. FIFA 23, FIFA 24, FIFA 25 and FIFA 26, and so on – the constant is the FIFA name and it will remain forever and remain THE BEST.” How long’s it going to take for someone else to scan hundreds of player models, Gianni? How about recreating all the stadiums, all the strips, all the other detailed hallmarks that make EA’s Fifa so authentic? Fifa’s millions of players love to argue about the tiny changes to the rhythm of play that come with every year’s iteration but ultimately, this is an extraordinary football simulation built on a peerless technical foundation and a huge amount of effort. You can’t just farm out the licence to someone else and expect them to come up with anything like EA Sports’ Fifa, especially not in two years or less. Going by Fifa’s extended statement on its plans for video games going forward – unsurprisingly, you can see the dollar signs spinning in their eyes – we can now anticipate a bunch of different smartphone games bearing the Fifa name, all from different developers, all cashing in maximally on all of Fifa’s various events and tournaments. Fifa is also “engaging” with “publishers, studios and investors” on a bigger football simulation, which will need to be out in 2024. As mentioned: good luck to them on that front. This is such a perfect example of corporations’ lack of understanding of video games, what it takes to make them, any why people even play them. With the notable exception of Microsoft, which has nonetheless thrown billions into a money pit in the course of establishing the Xbox as a credible name in video games, no huge external company has ever succeeded when it storms into the games world with drastically unrealistic expectations and no respect for how game studios work. Amazon has failed. Google has failed. It would be rather gratifying to see Fifa fail at this too, frankly. As for EA: we’re looking at a football metaverse from now on, really, with the football simulation sitting alongside clips from matches and social spaces and, god help us, probably NFTs. I’m sure they’ll do a very good job of it, and that it will be frighteningly efficient at extracting money from the people who interact with it. I’m not a Fifa player and my interest in football is limited exclusively to supporting Germany in every World Cup (sue me, I’m Scottish and we never get to take part), so this is something I can watch with detached interest. Diehard Fifa fans, however, who see the game as a fixture of their gaming and social lives, might be feeling more trepidation as we find out what the future of sports games looks like. I’ve turned to one of our critics, Sarah Maria Griffin, for this week’s game recommendation, partly because I was irresistibly intrigued by the name: Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion. “This anthropomorphic vegetable romp lives somewhere between the flash web cartoons of the early ‘00s and the 2D Zeldas,” she says, “though mercifully the tone is more reserved than the slapstick ‘lol random’ tone of the era it references. As the story unfolds it gains surprising depth, and there are two absolutely gasp-inducing horror moments. The apparent goal of the game is to pay off a debt to the mayor, but the Turnip Boy’s personal goal is the collection and destruction of pieces of important paper – love letters, deeds, evidence – all revealing details of a world far bigger it seems. Turnip Boy is full of surrealism and surprising heart: don’t be fooled by the silly title, there’s more here than meets the eye.” Available on: Xbox (it’s just hit Game Pass), PC, Nintendo Switch, Android phonesApproximate playtime: 4 hours Sony has spilled the beans on what’s included with its new PlayStation Plus subscriptions. Short version: lots of PS4 games, a few PS5 games, some older Ubisoft games, and PS3/PS2 games for people who pay a bit extra. In contrast to Microsoft Game Pass, which fills out the service with a whole bunch of interesting indie stuff, Sony seems to be relying on its own, very extensive catalogue to tempt subscribers. Horrible news from the States as a mass shooting in Buffalo, New York was detailed on gamer chat platform Discord and live-streamed on Twitch. Both companies removed the material almost immediately after it was discovered, but not before it proliferated across the worst parts of the Internet. In 2022, it is impossible to be ignorant that radicalisation of young, white men does happen on these platforms, as it does through social media. Certain sections of the right-wing media are once again using this as an excuse to blame video games for violence, an accusation so malevolent and disingenuous in the face of those same outlets’ opposition to gun control that I’m not going to dignify it with a response. Activision Blizzard spectacularly misread the room with a self-congratulatory blog post about a special tool that one of its studios came up with to improve diversity in game characters, illustrated with an image that assigned numerical values to eg “sexual orientation” and “ethnicity”. This is the most game-developer “solution” to gaming’s representation problem that it’s possible to imagine. I feel quite sorry for the people involved in the tool, who clearly had good intentions, as Activision Blizzard was forced to clarify after its own developers (and plenty of commentators) started piling on. Don't worry, everyone, Activision has come up with a Heptagon of Diversity to fix representation in gaming https://t.co/MF9Ywy2ZEK The Video Game History Foundation tracked down the person responsible for one of the first human female characters to star in a video game, 1982’s Wabbit. Her name is Van Mai, and they had been searching for her for years. The whole story is well worth a read (or a watch). Trek to Yomi review – a tropey but reverent tribute to Japanese cinema Fifa believes it can make great sims without EA – but it should heed the fate of Championship Manager The beautiful game got ugly: why I broke up with Fifa Today’s question comes from reader Benjamin, who is finding Elden Ring too stressful to play with a baby sleeping on him: What would you suggest might be a good peaceful game for a very sleep-deprived dad? Hang in there, Benjamin, I remember these days well. For many, many months when my kids were newborns, I stayed up all night with them playing video games while they intermittently slept and fed. I was so sleep deprived that I could remember almost nothing from night to night (I still barely remember these games now), so anything that was remotely difficult to follow was out of the question. Stardew Valley was my absolute go-to, a calm and repetitive farming game that recently sold its 20 millionth copy. (I played it for over 60 hours in the middle of the night and remember none of it.) Final Fantasy XV involved a surprising amount of just driving around, and the story was so ludicrous that it didn’t matter that I couldn’t follow it properly. Mini Metro just launched on Nintendo Switch and has you arranging transit systems in an unexpectedly zen fashion. Animal Crossing, of course, because it’s both quite mindless and very kind. Persona 5 just felt like an endless fever dream at the time but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Oh, and this game is in no way relaxing, but I played a lot of doomed space adventure Faster than Light on my iPad.

5/17/2022,"Fighting broke out in Tripoli after one of the two rival Libyan prime ministers entered the capital to claim the role only to flee hours later when he realised he had misjudged the scale of military opposition. Fathi Bashagha said he had retreated to prevent further bloodshed. It was clear he found that the levels of militia support he had been promised were not forthcoming. He had entered the city in secret overnight with the support of one powerful armed group, the eighth brigade, but it found itself isolated and no other support arrived from outside the city. In statements before his retreat, Bashagha’s camp made it clear they had planned to take control of the government, and claimed he had received a warm reception in the capital. The bulk of the clashes occurred at dawn. There has been stalemate in Libya with rival groups claiming to run the country. Parliamentary and presidential elections planned for last December had to be shelved as the eligibility of various candidates was disputed, and there was no consensus that the result would be honoured. Bashagha’s retreat not only damages him personally, and his efforts internationally to portray himself as a unifying figure, but is a boost for the caretaker prime minister based in Tripoli, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah. Bashagha, who comes from the north-western city of Misrata and is a former interior minister, surprisingly allied himself with Marshall Khalifa Haftar, the military strongman in the east, just before the planned December elections. He was appointed prime minister by the Libyan parliament in the east, the House of Representatives, in the spring. Dbeibah was made interim prime minister last year by an ad hoc UN body, but he was supposed only to remain in power until the elections. After they were postponed he refused to stand aside, and has continued to use Libyan oil revenues to shore up his popular support. The UK diplomatic mission in Tripoli was one of many embassies to urge calm. It said: “Events in Tripoli demonstrate urgent need for a durable political solution that cannot and must not be achieved by force. We urge all sides to de-escalate tension and engage in meaningful dialogue towards stability and successful elections.” The abortive attempt on Tripoli will add to calls for the international community to take a stronger grip on Libya’s reconciliation process. Germany has hosted two summits in a bid to persuade both sides to accept presidential and parliamentary elections, but last autumn’s change in government in Germany and the overriding focus on Ukraine has allowed Libya to slip down the diplomatic agenda. It is possible that the fighting will galvanise European leaders to refocus on the country. Most current diplomatic efforts have come from Stephanie Williams – who is acting as the special envoy of the UN secretary general, António Guterres, rather than as a UN security council-appointed envoy. She has been working to persuade both sides to agree to a draft constitution before elections. The absence of an agreed permanent constitution setting out the relationship between parliament and president was one of the reasons cited for delaying the election. The US embassy in Washington highlighted the need for progress on the constitution saying: “Political leaders must realise that seizing or retaining power through violence will only harm the people of Libya.”",News/World news,Clashes in Tripoli as would-be prime minister attempts to claim power,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/17/clashes-in-tripoli-as-would-be-prime-minister-attempts-to-claim-power
5/17/2022,"Text messages claiming the independent candidate challenging the traditionally safe Nationals seat of Nicholls, Rob Priestly, has been endorsed by “Dan Andrews’ Labor party” are being sent to voters in the electorate and appear to be authorised by the Coalition junior partner. Anna Kemp was among a number of constituents in the rural Victorian seat who received a text Monday evening which read: “You have been selected to participate in a survey by CMS Research about Rob Priestly’s endorsement by Daniel Andrews’ Labor Party.” The state premier has been controversial in some rural Victorian seats due to ongoing lockdowns. The text message provided a link to the website for CMS (Constituent Management Services), which the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) shows is an entity associated with the National Party of Australia – NSW. The website says it is authorised by “J. Lundy, Level 2, 107 Pitt St, Sydney, 2000.” Joe Lundy is the the state director of the NSW Nationals and the address given is the state headquarters. However, the link provided in the text message has subsequently been disabled. Guardian Australia contacted the NSW Nationals for confirmation their director Joe Lundy authorised the website. A spokesperson for Priestly said their office had lodged a complaint with the AEC over the text message, which was framed as a survey question but which they argued carried a political message without the required authorisation. Warringah MP Zali Steggall has introduced a “Stop the Lies” bill intending to change the status quo that “currently under Australian law it is perfectly legal to lie in a political ad”. Priestly told Guardian Australia said: “There’s absolutely no link between me and the Labor party.” Priestly, a local businessman, is increasingly seen as a threat to the Coalition in the seat, which has a margin of 20% but is hotly contested in a three-way contest between Nationals candidate Sam Birrell, Liberals candidate Steve Brooks and Priestly. Sitting Nationals MP Damien Drum announced his retirement late last year. Priestly says the National Party leader, Peter Walsh, approached him to stand as the National party candidate for the seat, so the Nationals knew he was not linked to Labor. The Nationals have denied Priestly was asked to stand as the candidate. Priestly says that while he turned down the offer because he didn’t want to run for the National party, “it then did start me thinking about whether or not I wanted to run at all”. This latest attempt to associate an independent candidate with a major party comes after earlier this month the AEC was called in to investigate fake election signs suggesting independent candidates are Greens members. Priestly calls it a “really poor” campaigning technique that the Nationals have employed “to win at any costs”. Asked if his vote was already decided, Dustin Kemp said “particularly now” after his wife received the text message. “It’s a horrible way to run a political party if you have to go to the man and not the ball. It’s pretty horrible,” he said. Kemp said that as a farmer the most important issue to him this election was policy around agriculture. “But more and more, doing the right thing and having confidence in politics [is important]. ” Birrell was contacted for comment.",News/Australia news,Texts sent out falsely claiming independent challenger in Nationals seat has Labor backing,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/17/texts-sent-out-claiming-independent-challenger-in-nationals-seat-has-labor-backing
