12/13/2021,"Jo Dyer, the arts administrator and prominent advocate of Christian Porter’s accuser, will run for the marginal South Australian seat of Boothby as an independent. Dyer is the endorsed candidate of Voices for Boothby, a grassroots group seeking to replicate the playbook that has helped elect independents including Helen Haines and Zali Steggall.  Boothby is held by the retiring Liberal MP Nicolle Flint on a margin of 1.4%, making it the third most marginal seat in the country. In 2016 the Nick Xenophon Team attracted 20% of the vote in Boothby, suggesting there is potential for a non-major party challenger in the outer metropolitan seat stretching from Glenelg to the Adelaide Hills. The seat is being contested by the chief executive of St Vincent de Paul Society SA, Louise Miller Frost, for Labor, and the health consultant Rachel Swift, for the Liberal party. Dyer is one of a new wave of liberal progressive independents campaigning in traditionally blue-ribbon seats, including Zoe Daniel in Goldstein and Allegra Spender in Wentworth, who tend to emphasise the fight against climate change, support for a strong federal integrity commission and gender equality as their key demands. Dyer is a former chief executive of the Sydney writers’ festival and the outgoing director of Adelaide writers’ week who shot to national prominence after Porter revealed in March that he was the cabinet minister who was the subject of an ABC story revealing that a dossier had been circulated to a number of politicians. It detailed claims by a woman that he had raped her when they were debating teammates in January 1988, when she was 16 and he was 17. Porter strenuously denied the allegation and that he had any sexual contact with the alleged victim, who took her life in mid-2020 after withdrawing from the New South Wales police investigation. Dyer became the public spokesperson for a group of the deceased woman’s friends lobbying for an inquiry into the allegation and Porter’s fitness to be a minister. When Porter sued the ABC for defamation for reporting on the dossier, Dyer obtained court orders against his barrister Sue Chrysanthou, forcing her off the case on the basis Chrysanthou had received confidential information potentially relevant to the case when she met Dyer in November 2020, before she had been briefed by Porter, to discuss a separate matter. In May Porter agreed to discontinue the case against the ABC in return for an editor’s note being added to the story stating the public broadcaster “regretted” that some readers had “misinterpreted” the article “as an accusation of guilt against Mr Porter”. After leaving the attorney general’s portfolio to pursue the case, Porter revealed in a declaration of interests in September he had part-funded it with money from undisclosed sources from what he described as a blind trust. The minister denied breaching disclosure rules and was later cleared by the privileges committee but quit the cabinet in September because the issue had become a “distraction” for the government.

The appeal is to be heard in April. In May Dyer told the federal court she wanted the allegation against Porter made public in an attempt to stop him ever becoming prime minister. Dyer became friends with the woman during their time as high school debaters in the 1980s. Dyer has argued that women have been let down by political leaders, citing Chanel Contos’s “devastating spreadsheet of teenage girls allegedly assaulted by their ostensible friends from the country’s most ‘elite’ schools”, and Scott Morrison’s claim he supported women’s rise but not “on the basis of others doing worse”.",News/Australia news,"Jo Dyer, advocate of Christian Porter’s accuser, to stand as independent in Boothby",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/13/jo-dyer-advocate-of-christian-porters-accuser-to-stand-as-independent-in-boothby
12/13/2021,"Experts have warned that the next variant of Covid-19 to sweep the world could emerge on Australia’s doorstep, due to incredibly low rates of vaccination rates in Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea is Australia’s closest neighbour, and at its nearest point is just 4km from Australian territory in the Torres Strait. At various points in the pandemic there have been fears that travellers from PNG could bring the virus to Australia.  “I’m worried that PNG is the next place where a new variant emerges,” said Adrian Prouse, head of international humanitarian programs at the Australian Red Cross. “In PNG less than 5% [of the adult population is vaccinated], in Indonesia, just under one-third. Two countries right on our doorstep with significant challenges in getting vaccines into arms.” Stefanie Vaccher, an epidemiologist with the Burnet Institute who has been based in PNG since last year, echoed this concern. “In populations that have low rates of vaccination coverage, there are more opportunities for the virus to spread and mutate. In PNG, where less than 4% of the population are vaccinated, there are a lot of opportunities for the virus to mutate and spread.” Vaccher said the Australian government and people should care about the spread of Covid-19 in PNG not just for what it might mean for Australia. “I don’t think it should matter which country a variant emerges in for the world to care. Countries have a responsibility to think globally and the pandemic has revealed how interconnected we are … It’s important not just because it’s a potential risk for their populations, who might lose hard-fought grounds, or people have struggled through lockdowns. These are people suffering in any country and their lives are equally as important as anyone else.” Papua New Guinea has been dealing with a devastating outbreak of Covid-19 throughout 2021. The official death toll from the virus is 573, with about 35,000 cases, but the true scale of the outbreak is hard to define due to low testing rates and stigma about having the disease. Reports suggest people ask doctors not to put Covid-19 as the cause of death on death certificates of their loved ones. Vaccher said a study conducted in PNG around March 2021 – before the big wave of the virus – showing that 24% of healthcare workers at Port Moresby general hospital already had antibodies to Covid-19 pointed to how widespread and undetected Covid transmission had been. Covid has also crippled Papua New Guinea’s already stretched and under-resourced health system. “Right now PNG is dealing with a surge in Delta,” Prouse said. “When you overlay a surge of Delta with a really fragile healthcare system, high rates of illness, poor rates of access to sanitation, clean water, you see a rise in hospitalisation and death. “We’ve seen the major hospitals in PNG scale down their medical services. The worrying thing, from a much longer-term perspective, we’re starting to see a rise in issues around malaria, TB, other illnesses, poor maternal health and infant health.” “Another devastating fact is that maternal mortality has doubled in the last year,” Vaccher said. “Covid would play into that a bit – Covid does affect pregnant women. But it is also due to the fact that hospitals have shut down, doctors and nurses are off work with Covid, people are too afraid to come to the hospital for appointments.” Prouse said that while vaccine supply to PNG had been adequate, and he praised the Australian government for doing “a really good job on getting vaccines to our Pacific neighbours”, the issues in PNG were about “getting arms to vaccines”, with problems around cold storage, health messaging and especially vaccine hesitancy. Both experts said Australia’s messaging around AstraZeneca early in the year did not help people in PNG to have confidence in the vaccine’s safety. The Australian government donated tens of thousands of doses of AstraZeneca to PNG, at the same time as it was recommending Australians under 60 not get that vaccine due to the very small risk of blood clots. “There are serious issues with vaccine hesitancy in PNG – people just not willing to get vaccinated for multitudes of reasons: concerns around the vaccine, concerns around sorcery, concerns around being stigmatised,” Prouse said. “These are issues that are really putting Australia at risk of the next variant being on our doorstep. “This is not a hand-out-a-pamphlet-and-walk-away situation. You’ve got to win hearts and minds over, you have to convince people [the vaccine] is not something to be feared and it’s actually going to save their life,” he said. “I think the best thing is the Australian government funding the local organisations who have the reach into communities and trust of communities to go in.”",News/World news,Experts warn Papua New Guinea is potential breeding ground for new Covid variants,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/experts-warn-papua-new-guinea-is-potential-breeding-ground-for-new-covid-variants
