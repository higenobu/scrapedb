4/8/2022,"In November and December 1781, 132 enslaved Africans held captive on the British ship Zong were thrown overboard into the Caribbean sea and murdered. This brutal event and the subsequent London court cases which energised the abolitionist movement are chronicled in The Meaning of Zong, Giles Terera’s debut play. Originally due to be staged in 2020 and adapted for radio last year, it now receives a richly theatrical first production. Framed by a contemporary setting, the play is resolutely aware of its place in the present moment and how its resonances may differ after the events of the intervening two years. It refrains from didacticism and easy metaphors. Although the playwright not only shares directing duties with Tom Morris but also stars as abolitionist Olaudah Equiano, it is very much an ensemble piece. Roles and scenery swiftly segue from one scene to the next: talking bookshelves become a crackling fireplace and revolutionary printing presses; slaves become judges. Performed to music composed and spectacularly played live by Sidiki Dembele, Terera’s nimble script moves to its own rhythm. An extended and exquisitely lyrical second-act monologue might, in a less assured production, feel like it belongs to a different play. Here it feels wholly apposite, performed to devastating effect by Kiera Lester. There is however a little dissonance between the inventive theatricality of the staging and the sheer brutality of the events at its centre. Despite the fact that little of this violence is depicted on stage, it remains insidiously present. In Jean Chan’s set, the vestiges of empire are everywhere: the rafters that hold up courts of law also form the hulls of the slave trade. While the legacies of this trade continue to reverberate, so do the victories of those who campaigned against it. And here, in its final minutes, The Power of Zong feels its most triumphant. Devastating and urgent, history unfurls and keeps on moving. It is a profoundly moving moment.

4/8/2022,"Everton have announced that Danish manager Brian Sørensen will take charge of the team ahead of the 2022-23 season and has signed a two-year contract with the club. The 41-year-old joins the Blues from Fortuna Hjørring, the team he rejoined at the start of the 2021-22 season having previously reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League in 2016-17 and won two Elitedivisionen titles with the club. Sørensen began his managerial career with IK Skovbakken and spent time as manager of FC Nordsjaelland, winning the Danish Cup with both sides and promotion to the Elitedivisionen with the latter. Everton currently sit 10th in the WSL table on 18 points with their league status safe as they are 13 points clear of bottom-placed Birmingham , who have four matches to play. The team will continue to be led by former assistants Chris Roberts and Claire Ditchburn in the interim, following the sacking of Willie Kirk in October after a slow start to the campaign. Sørensen said: “I’m extremely excited to join Everton. It is one of the historic clubs in women’s football and our backgrounds fit nicely, with common values, work ethic and ambitions. Having studied the squad in depth during this process, I feel there is massive potential, with players capable of making an impact on the biggest stages.” Everton Women’s managing director, Alan McTavish, who led on the recruitment process alongside director of football, Kevin Thelwell, said: “We are delighted to welcome Brian to the club. Throughout the process to appoint a new manager there has been considerable interest in the role and after a great deal of consideration, we are confident we have found the best person to lead the team into next season and beyond. “Brian was the outstanding candidate from a very strong field, and he is a proven winner. His vision for the team, along with his ambition and drive to move Everton Women forward, impressed us throughout the interview process.” ",Sport/Football,Everton Women confirm Brian Sørensen will take over next season ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/08/everton-women-confirm-brian-srensen-will-take-over-next-season
4/8/2022,"Stories of desperation are emerging in Shanghai as the city enters its third day of strict lockdown, with increasingly widespread reports of residents being unable to access food, medicine and other essentials. The city’s Covid lockdown was extended indefinitely earlier this week after staggered restrictions failed to contain infections. City officials had promised the staggered lockdown would end on 5 April, leaving many residents of the Chinese megacity unprepared to be indefinitely housebound. Despite the severe measures, Shanghai’s cases continue to rise as mandatory testing continues. The city reported 20,398 new infections on Friday, 824 of which were symptomatic. Frustrated cries of help are circulating on Weibo, China’s microblogging platform, where residents complain about a lack of food and haphazard lockdown measures. “No matter where you live, whether you have money or not, you have to worry about what else you can eat and how you can buy things,” one comment read on Thursday. “Do you want to starve the people of Baoshan to death?” a resident from the suburban district wrote, complaining about a lack of food. There were also signs that medical volunteers who have been brought into the city to help with the pandemic effort are themselves struggling to access food. “Are the supplies just for Shanghai locals? … As an outsider, I can be a volunteer, but why are the goods and supplies not assigned to us?” a female medical volunteer cries in a video on Douyin, China’s TikTok-like platform. One video posted to social media, but not verified, shows a man screaming on the phone to the authorities, saying he is starving to death. Drones flew across the sky of the city earlier this week, video on China’s social media showed, warning people protesting on their balconies to stay indoors. As seen on Weibo: Shanghai residents go to their balconies to sing & protest lack of supplies. A drone appears: “Please comply w covid restrictions. Control your soul’s desire for freedom. Do not open the window or sing.” https://t.co/0ZTc8fznaV pic.twitter.com/pAnEGOlBIh The growing cries for help are also prompting concern elsewhere in the country. “Every day when I wake up and check Weibo, it is either a post crying out for help or an abusive post about not being able to grab food. No one would have thought that in 2022 there will be a large-scale food shortage in Shanghai,” a Weibo user from Ningbo, south of the city in Zhejiang province, wrote on Thursday. Rights observers have also expressed increasing concern. ​“The use of the word ‘lockdown’ can be quite imprecise when used in China compared with the rest of the world,” said Maya Wang, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, adding that it did not fully capture the severity of the situation. Residents of means have turned to groups to bulk-buy supplies, but access to these avenues is outside the reach of the most vulnerable. “If you are poor or have disabilities or you are old, often you can be shut out of these resources or don’t know about these resources. The consequences can be quite dire,” Wang said, commenting on reports that some elderly people have died during the lockdown after not being able to access vital medication. The strict lockdown on the cosmopolitan city of 26 million is shaping up to be the largest challenge to China’s strict “dynamic zero” Covid policy. Analysts say any easing of restrictions will be unlikely ahead of a meeting of the 20th national party congress in November, where China’s leader, Xi Jinping, is expected to seek another five-year-term.",News/World news,Desperation amid food shortages in Shanghai as Covid lockdown bites,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/desperation-amid-food-shortages-in-shanghai-as-covid-lockdown-bites
4/8/2022,"Moon Witch, Spider King by Marlon James (Hamish Hamilton, £20)The second part of the Dark Star trilogy is the story of the Moon Witch, from her long-ago beginnings as a no-name girl, hated by brothers who blame her for their mother’s death, and made to live in a termite hill. She escapes from them as she later escapes the roles men try to assign her: whore, slave, wife, victim. She names herself Sogolon, discovers a powerful force and inadvertently attracts the attention of Aesi, who is clearly much more than just an adviser to the king. By the time she meets Tracker, the “Red Wolf” of the previous book, and becomes part of the quest to find a mysterious lost boy, she has outlived everyone who ever knew her. If Black Leopard, Red Wolf was an exploration of masculinity, this companion volume examines the more restricted lives of women in the same violent, male-dominated world. Booker winner James’s African-inspired imaginary kingdoms mark the series out from the usual run of epic fantasies, but his uniquely supple, powerful style is even more distinctive. Braking Day by Adam Oyebanji (Jo Fletcher, £20)This debut novel is set on a generation starship as the end of its long voyage comes into view. Soon the ship will start to brake, and even if the destination world is not as habitable as hoped, the passengers will be stuck on it. Not all the space-born descendants of the First Crew who initiated the project are happy about the prospect of leaving their home for unknown hardships. Without a ship to command with military discipline, would the elite officer class retain their power? Ravi MacLeod, a trainee engineer, is already divided between loyalty to his working-class criminal family and his ambition to become an officer. When he finds evidence of attempted sabotage, he faces even more difficult choices. But there’s a greater danger outside, lurking in the darkness of space … This richly imagined, intricately plotted adventure is crammed with ideas, and has many surprises in store. Amongst Our Weapons by Ben Aaronovitch (Orion, £18.99)In the latest Rivers of London book, DC Peter Grant is anticipating becoming the father of twins, as his beloved Beverley turns the back garden into an enormous birthing pool – but meanwhile he must solve a mysterious, possibly magical, murder in the London Silver Vaults. Aaronovitch has no peers when it comes to successfully combining the appeal of a down-to-earth police procedural with all-out fantasy: here are real places, real history and real problems complicated by the existence of magic, ancient spirits, fairies, ghosts and talking foxes, all dwelling alongside ordinary, clueless humans. His plotting is still satisfyingly inventive and the continuing characters maintain their charm in the ninth novel of a series that began in 2011. Stringers by Chris Panatier (Angry Robot £9.99)Ben has struggled all his life with the puzzle of why his brain is stuffed with details about subjects he’s never studied; chiefly oddities of natural history, with an emphasis on weird insect sex. He’s also haunted by something about a Chime and the Note of Jecca, so when he finds someone online who claims he can explain it all, he agrees to a meeting. Ben’s best (and only) friend Patton insists on going along for protection, and the two of them wind up as prisoners on an alien spaceship. Their abductor, Aptet, is a big fan of Michael Jackson and American reality TV but makes his living trapping and selling “stringers” – rare souls like Ben, born with memories belonging to other lives. A race called the Scythin have been searching for the lost Chime and hope to find its location by dredging Ben’s mind. If they get what they want, the whole galaxy will be destroyed. Delightfully smart, funny, fast-moving entertainment that really did make me laugh out loud. The Cuckoo Cage edited by Ra Page (Comma Press, £12.99)The notion behind this original anthology is to draw a line from the popular American superhero (who, says the editor, “props up a reactionary, pro-capitalist view of the world”) back to British folk “proto-heroes”, who were the figureheads of popular protest movements to protect pre-industrial, pre-capitalist ways of life. A dozen authors have each created a modern social justice warrior modelled on one from the past (General Ludd, Captain Swing), with an added superpower. Each story is followed by a brief history lesson. The result is a mixed bag. I especially liked Lisa Luxx’s Lexi, “swinging like some shape-shifting Tarzan on the vines of eye-contact”, and Bidisha’s subtle story exploring class loyalty and the trouble with thinking of society as divided into us v them.",Arts/Books,The best recent science fiction and fantasy – reviews roundup,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/08/the-best-recent-science-fiction-and-fantasy-reviews-roundup
4/8/2022,"Originally published under the title For Love of Imabelle, this 1957 novel from Chester Himes opens with Jackson, a gullible undertaker’s assistant, sinking his life savings into a transparently dodgy scam that claims to convert $10 bills into hundreds. After he is left broke, he decides to “borrow” some money from his boss in an attempt to claw back his losses at the craps table, and loses that too. Samuel L Jackson delivers a rip-roaring narration of Himes’s grimly comic, fast-paced and intermittently blood-spattered novel set in Harlem, described as “a city of black people who are convulsed in a desperate living, like the voracious churning of millions of hungry cannibal fish. Blind mouths eating their own guts. Stick in a hand and draw back a nub.” The actor breathes vivid life into the book’s lineup of crooks, con artists, pimps and ne’er-do-wells. There’s Goldy, the protagonist’s twin, who masquerades as the saintly Sister Gabriel and lives off the charitable donations dispensed by church-goers, while his girlfriend, Imabelle, may or may not be up to no good. Meanwhile, the nicknames of no-nonsense detectives “Coffin” Ed Johnson and “Grave Digger” Jones give a sense of their style of law enforcement. This is the duo’s first appearance in what became the Harlem Detective series (other books include The Real Cool Killers, Cotton Comes to Harlem and Blind Man With a Pistol).

4/8/2022,"At Goila Butter Chicken in London, lunch is served with a lavish, side portion of hyperbole. According to chef Saransh Goila, this is not merely butter chicken, but, “quite simply the best butter chicken in the world”. I scrutinised the website for a touch of tongue in cheek, but instead also discovered that Mumbai-based Goila has “single-handedly turned butter chicken into a religion in India”. Similar to Noel Gallagher believing 1997-era Oasis was “bigger than God”, Goila’s butter chicken is now an omnipresent deity. This is massive, if true.What is definitely true is that Goila is a name on the Mumbai food scene, hosting shows on Indian cookery channel Food Food and appearing on Australian MasterChef. In 2014 he entered the Limca Book of Records for “longest road journey by a chef”, a title unrivalled by Gordon, Fred and Gino’s madlad antics across Mexico. Goila is a smooth operator: his butter chicken is available via meal kit, recently appeared on BBC1’s Saturday Kitchen and there are Goila Butter Chicken cafes across Mumbai, Pune and Bengaluru. This is his first opening in London: a strip of 12 seats along a sit-up bar in a busy restaurant thoroughfare near Oxford Street. With Goila Butter Chicken’s preamble being so verbose, eating there couldn’t fail to be something of a disappointment. This is not the Hanging Gardens of Babylon; it’s an anonymous-looking cafe, on the side of a pop-up restaurant space called Carousel. To the unassuming eye, there is nothing of interest. It’s a white, undecorated space with a few friendly folk serving up bowls of butter chicken – which have been cooked elsewhere, not behind the counter – with sides of dal makhani, jeera rice and sourdough naan. Saransh Goila himself was too busy to make an appearance in the opening weeks, although he describes the space as “very, very casual”. This is a fancy way of saying: “You’d be more comfortable at home.” This space isn’t ideal to eat butter chicken, unless one is enamoured of tall, unforgiving bar stools and not a great deal of elbow room to pick at one’s pickled shallots and coriander chutney. As I ate, takeaway customers loitered for the other offerings such as the GBC fried chicken burger or the cauliflower bites.Deciding whether Goila’s butter chicken is world-class is another matter because, to my mind, even mediocre butter chicken – murgh makhani – is blissful. Soft chicken, crushed tomato, some sort of cream, or yoghurt or even evaporated milk, with a glut of ghee or butter, plus gentle spices such as garam masala, turmeric and cumin; on any table butter chicken is comfort food in extremis; a sunset-coloured, moppable, scoopable vision of joy. It’s the dish least likely at any mixed gathering to become “leftovers”. At Goila, they claim to elevate the concept by using only good French butter and cooking free-range, slow-grown, herb-fed Yorkshire chickens over eco-friendly charcoal from FSC-certified forests. They use no colourings, no sugar and a tomato-to-dairy ratio of 80:20, which makes for a darker, healthier-feeling, more refined dish, than something British or indeed Indian palates may expect. You may well miss the sugar, ghee, oils and colourings because when all is said and done, they give dishes a certain pizzazz that natural products do not. Goila’s chicken certainly didn’t leave me as bloated or full-feeling as less-refined versions, but it made little real impact. I wanted to be moved and enlightened by this dish, but instead found it “pleasant”. More dramatic was the naan: small, floppy, steaming and possibly microwaved. The pickles were delicious, pink and vibrant and the black dal makhani perfectly edible, but not as deep, sating and wowish as the chain restaurant Dishoom’s, which I have eaten by the vat. I cannot comment on the coriander chutney, as it didn’t arrive.Goila’s butter chicken is not bad. It is smoky and buttery and rather sparingly portioned – however, I felt no real urge to declare the chef my new spiritual leader. Not over a squidgy naan and a lunch where I balanced my handbag on my knee. Chefs are peculiar animals: some appear on the scene modest and self-effacing, simply hoping that someone will like them; others arrive like a whirlwind, full of hilarious claims, promising earth, wind and fire, delivering very little and not even being there to cook it. The whole thing is really very silly. But then, I put on lipstick and shoes, and rushed to a restaurant, waving cash, because the chef had announced that his butter chicken was a new religion in the planet’s second most populous country.

4/8/2022,"When my mother was in her 20s and living in London, she visited a psychic at his home in the suburbs. He had done some healing work for her friend Carla, a basketball player, who after an injury had had some success with Mr Trevor where traditional physio had failed. That was his name – Mr Trevor – and as my mother would tell me every time the story was wheeled out, he was a “retired postmaster” and a “very humble man”. In other words, not a charlatan. I recall looking through her address book after her death, and there he still was, under the Ts. He must have been long dead by then too. It was the story of Mr Trevor that softened me up for a lifetime of susceptibility to woo-woo spiritual nonsense, something I can apparently disparage without ever quite letting go. The psychic world is 99% baloney, and approaching a medium the last resort of the desperate. These people exploit the grief-stricken and clog up police investigations with false leads. I know this, as all rational people do. Yet, while in my own 20s, I went recreationally with friends to a medium, and I can’t remember a thing about it save for how much we laughed afterwards. There is Mr Trevor, telling my mother she would have one child, a girl, with “long fingers, like a starfish”, then coming over all funny and croaking out a phrase her dead father used to say to her as a child. I have nowhere to put this, except under the heading Things I Know to Be True That I Know Not to Be True. In his new book The Premonitions Bureau, the New Yorker writer Sam Knight unearths an extraordinary story of scientific engagement with psychic phenomena in mid-20th-century Britain. It relates to the career of John Barker, a psychiatrist who, after the Aberfan Welsh mining disaster in 1966, started collecting data from members of the public who claimed to have foreseen some shadow of the event. From there, he set up a small team in conjunction with the Evening Standard, to invite and log premonitions from the public. In among a lot of time-wasters, several credible people emerged, whose visions lined up, usually within a matter of weeks, with real-world events: plane crashes and other disasters. As Barker himself understood, the irresolvable paradox here is that if premonitions are real and can be acted on to avert a disaster, then the disaster foretold will fail to occur, and won’t show up in advance as a premonition. I’m writing this as if any of it accords with the laws of physics; we are a spit and holler away from time travel here. And yet Barker’s insistence that “second sight” has a practical application was also, it seems to me, simply a pretext to justify the emotional interest. One suspects that, beneath the psychiatrist’s public interest defence of his wacky investigation, lay a deeper purpose. We want these things to be true because the alternative – no order, no recourse, no organisation beyond the entirely random, and nothing, nothing, after we’ve gone – is just too bleak to allow. And we do love to tell these stories. It’s like relating your dreams, only worse. Most people have a Mr Trevor-type story. It’s not interesting but here’s mine: coming home on the train, seeing in my mind’s eye my mother falling down the stairs and thinking, with a jolt, I must remind her to be careful given how weak her legs are from chemo. Walking into my parents’ house 15 minutes later to find her in a heap at the bottom of the stairs, waiting for the ambulance after a fall that, my father said, had happened precisely 15 minutes earlier. There’s no life after death, I tell my children when they ask. We’re not religious, I say, although they’re free to make up their own minds. And yet I can’t help it: the indoctrination has already begun. I speculate to them vaguely about “energies” – that, hard as it is to imagine being around after we die, it’s harder to imagine nothing remaining. I do this partly strategically, as a hedge against the possibility of my own death while they’re still young, in the event it may provide some comfort. (Also, to imbue them with a vague but unshakeable sense I’m still watching, so they needn’t think about going off the rails.) Anyway, it’s all nonsense. Of course it is. Thrilling and entertaining and consoling, and the rest of it, but a fundamentally human weakness in the service of which evidence is distorted and bent. When I was a child, my mother used to tell me I was so brilliant I should have been a twin. “I wish you’d been twins, with auburn hair,” she would say. The fact that I have twins with auburn hair is, of course, coincidence, completely explainable by the fact that twins and red hair run in my family. Right? Fluke. Must be. What else could it possibly be. Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist based in New York. She is the author of She Left Me the Gun: My Mother’s Life Before Me",Opinion/Opinion,I’m a rational person.

4/8/2022,"The UK has imposed sanctions on Vladimir Putin’s two adult daughters, following in the footsteps of the US in another symbolic move to put pressure on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Katerina Tikhonova and Maria Vorontsova will be subject to an asset freeze and a travel ban, although it is not clear whether either of them has ever visited the UK or whether they own any assets within reach of UK officials. The US imposed sanctions on the women on Wednesday, with a senior US official saying that many of Putin’s assets were hidden with family members. There have been persistent but unconfirmed reports that Putin has fathered other daughters but Tikhonova and Vorontsova are his only publicly acknowledged children. Both were designated by the UK on Friday under an urgent procedure, under which the government can impose sanctions on the basis of allies’ evidence if they think it is in the public interest. The urgent procedure gives the UK 56 days to find its own evidence. The EU has also imposed sanctions the sisters as part of a new package of measures targeting Russia’s economy, businessmen and oligarchs, according to two EU officials who spoke to Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Neither daughter had been added to the EU’s public sanctions list on Friday morning. A report on the EUobserver website earlier this week, citing a draft version of that EU list, claimed the soon-to-be-announced sanctions would also cover several wives, ex-wives, sisters, stepdaughters and mothers-in-law of pro-Kremlin oligarchs. Putin’s daughters with his former wife, Lyudmila, have kept a low public profile and have not made any official public appearances with him as adults. The UK’s sanctions designation said Vorontsova was born in April 1985 in Leningrad, now St Petersburg, and that Tikhonova was born a year later in Dresden, where Putin worked undercover as a spy for the KGB intelligence service until the fall of the Soviet Union. The US described Tikhonova as a “tech executive”. It said Vorontsova, thought to be a paediatric endocrinologist studying the effects of hormones on the body, leads state-funded programmes that have “received billions of dollars from the Kremlin toward genetics research and are personally overseen by Putin”. Tikhonova, who uses the surname of her maternal grandmother, studied at St Petersburg State University and Moscow State University and has a master’s degree in physics and mathematics. While Putin has previously said they “live their own lives”, the US government has said there is evidence that those around them have benefited from their father’s power. Tikhonova was previously married to Kirill Shamalov, who was designated for sanctions in April 2018 by the US in response to Russia’s “worldwide malign activity”. The US government said Shamalov married Tikhonova in February 2013. “His fortunes drastically improved following the marriage,” the US said, pointing to the acquisition of a large portion of shares of Sibur, a Russian oil and gas producer, and a $1bn loan from the state-controlled Gazprombank that helped propel him into the “billionaire elite”.",News/World news,UK joins US in imposing sanctions on Putin’s daughters,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/08/putin-daughters-sanctions-asset-travel-ban-uk
4/8/2022,"Boris Johnson has moved to paper over differences with Germany on support for Ukraine, by hailing Berlin’s “principled determination” to end its dependency on Russian energy before a meeting in London with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. It is the first meeting between the two men since the Social Democrat Scholz was elected to lead a three-party coalition government, and follows a week in which Germany resisted British calls for the major economies to set out a timetable to end dependency on Russian energy. In advance of the meeting with Scholz in Downing Street, the UK prime minister said: “I welcome his principled determination to end dependence on Russian energy. How we respond to Russia’s invasion will define the international order for years to come. We cannot let Putin’s crimes go unpunished.” Scholz has been criticised domestically and by Ukrainian politicians for not moving fast enough to wean Germany off its decades-old dependency on cheap Russian energy, and for being slow to back the transfer of the heavy weaponry Ukraine needs. He has also been warned by German industrialists that an immediate gas embargo would lead to mass unemployment, a position largely shared by the Green party, his coalition partners. Robert Habeck, the German economy and energy minister, has announced plans to stop importing oil and coal from Russia this year, and gas by mid-2024. Johnson is also expected to discuss the delivery of “new and heavier” weapons to Ukraine in an acknowledgment that the conflict has entered a “new and different phase”. Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, told Deutschlandfunk radio on Thursday that Kyiv was “expecting” Berlin to deliver Marder and Leopard tanks, as well as the anti-aircraft Gepard system. “The lists are there, the German government knows about them, but unfortunately it remains silent until today,” Melnyk said. Norbert Röttgen, a member of the opposition CDU and longstanding supporter of greater German military involvement in Ukraine, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Germany has been too slow, too late and doing little to put the maximum pressure on Vladimir Putin.” He said polls in Germany showed there was growing support and majority for imposing an immediate energy embargo on Russia. He accepted it would mean significant economic disadvantages, but insisted there would be no economic catastrophe. He said German industry had to realise this was a war for freedom. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, had pressed the G7 including Germany to set out a timetable to end its dependency on Russian energy, but the G7 statement issued on Thursday contained only an aspiration to reduce dependency. Over nearly two days of meetings, the EU this week has so far only agreed to end Russian coal imports by August, but a consensus on introducing a phased oil or gas embargo has not yet been reached. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs chief, said it was likely to be introduced “sooner or later”. The issue is set to be discussed again at an EU foreign affairs meeting on Monday. In 2021, revenues from fossil fuels made up 35% of Russia’s budget income. Russia exported more than 49% of its oil and 74% of its gas to Europe. Russia is heading for the deepest recession since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Britain predicted on Friday, as it estimated more than £275bn ($358.52bn) of Russian money had been frozen by international sanctions in recent weeks.",News/Politics,Johnson hails German ‘determination’ over Ukraine before Scholz meeting,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/08/boris-johnson-hails-german-determination-over-ukraine-before-olaf-scholz-meeting

To offer up something for everyone, we’ve gone all out this week, by recommending a show for pretty much every last streaming platform available. Whether it’s prestige crime drama or trashy reality TV you’re after, hopefully there’s something here for you. AcornTV: The Chelsea Detective This plucky streaming startup seems to primarily serve up cosy-if-old-fashioned detective dramas. If that’s your thing, then you may enjoy The Chelsea Detective, a cosy-if-old-fashioned detective drama elevated by the quizzical eyebrows of Adrian Scarborough. All 4: Derry Girls Lisa McGee’s comedy, set at the tail end of the Troubles, returns for its third and final series on Channel 4 next week. The previous two are available to wolf down in full on All 4. Amazon Prime Video: The Boys Hannah J Davies already flagged the excellent Hacks in last week’s newsletter, so let’s instead go for this acerbic, ultra-violent superhero satire, which returns in a couple of months for its third outing, giving you just enough time to rattle through the head-bursting, Marvel-skewering delights of its first two series. (Warning: it is really, really grisly at points.) Apple TV+: Pachinko I’m not alone in thinking that Apple is making the best TV of any streamer around at the moment. Regular readers of this newsletter will know about show of the year candidate Severance already, and there’s also rumpled spy thriller Slow Horses, speculative space race drama For All Mankind and likable comedies including Mythic Quest, Dickinson and, of course, Ted Lasso. Pachinko though might turn out to be the jewel in its crown: a beautifully shot, century-spanning epic following one family’s experiences as Korean immigrants in Japan, it’s TV elevated to the level of Palme d’Or-winning drama. Dynamite credit sequence, too. BBC iPlayer: The Hunt for Bible John Yes, we could point to any number of acclaimed scripted series from The Responder to This is Going To Hurt, but that wouldn’t be terribly novel, would it? Instead how about this excellent two-part documentary from BBC Scotland about a serial killer in 60s Glasgow, which largely sidelines the tawdry true crime stuff in favour of a fascinating social history of a city on the brink. BritBox: The Beast Must Die Predicted to fail pretty much from the moment it was announced, BritBox has endured thanks mainly to the strength of its back catalogue: where else can you catch all 10 series of Minder, after all? Its original shows are a slightly more patchy affair (*cough* Spitting Image *cough*) but The Beast Must Die was a pleasing exception: a taut thriller that sees the never-less-than-great Cush Jumbo aim to avenge her son’s death, with Jared Harris’s odious business magnate in her crosshairs. Crunchyroll: Attack on Titan Confession time: this anime-specific streaming site is very much not for everyone. And as someone slightly baffled by the appeal of most anime (except Akira, obviously), I’m not sure it’s for me either. But I did catch the first series of Attack on Titan – an extremely intense saga about a city beset by grinning, cannibalistic giants and the teens tasked with taking them down – when it was briefly on Netflix and I was completely and utterly hooked. It’s twisty, violent, very daft and often heart-stoppingly dramatic – so much so that every year I find myself signing up to Crunchyroll for a few months every year to keep up with the latest episodes. Discovery+: The Men Who Sold the World Cup Discovery’s splashy entry into streaming is good for those who want to catch up with the entertainment giant’s live TV channels without signing up to a costly TV package. It has some original shows too, including this revealing and timely two-part documentary about the grubbiness surrounding the award of the 2022 FIFA World Cup to Qatar. Disney+: Reservation Dogs Moon Knight? The Dropout? All nine series of 24? There’s frankly far too much to be found on Disney’s streaming service, but let’s opt for this slightly under-the-radar comedy-drama from Taika Waititi and Sterlin Harjo, about four Native American teens attempting to escape their reservation through fair means and foul. It’s stylish, sweet and extremely funny. IMDb TV: The West Wing For anyone who doesn’t want to fork out for streaming services, IMDb TV is a pretty spectacular option. You’ll need to watch it through the Amazon Prime app or have an Amazon-enabled TV or Firestick to view it (though you won’t need to fork out for a Prime account), and you’ll have to sit through a few ads, but there’s a hefty archive of TV shows and films on the other side of them: for example, it’s the only place you can stream all seven series of The West Wing at present in the UK. ITV Hub: The Ipcress File Pretty much everyone was expecting to hate this TV remake of the classic 60s spy thriller, but it turned out to be a welcome surprise: stylish, timely and with a lead (Joe Cole) who can go toe to toe with Michael Caine as Harry Palmer. Watch the lot on the ITV Hub. Hayu: Top Chef I run a mile from most reality TV, so Hayu – a streaming service that offers nothing but – isn’t really my thing. But it does have Top Chef, the much-loved US cookery show pitched somewhere between MasterChef and Great British Menu, and if there was anything that would sway me it’s probably that. My5: Yellowstone Alongside All Creatures Great and Small and many, many shows about Yorkshire, Channel 5’s streaming service has a pretty deep bench of American series, due to being owned by Paramount. Why not try one of the very biggest shows on US TV at the moment, the Kevin Costner-starring neo-western Yellowstone? My5 only has its first series at the moment, but series two is being repeated weekly from Saturday 16 April on 5Action. Netflix: Standing Up Netflix’s English-language scripted series have been a little weak as of late, but its international productions are picking up the slack. Here’s the latest sure-fire hit: a sharp comedy drama about Parisian comedians from the creator of Call My Agent!, no less. NOW: Winning Time – The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty Did The Last Dance create a sudden and insatiable hunger in you for series about the NBA? You’re in luck: NOW are streaming HBO’s Adam McKay-produced, John C Reilly drama about the LA Lakers’ entertaining ‘Showtime era’ of the 80s and early 90s. Shudder: Cursed Films This horror-specific streaming service largely focuses on movies, be they thrillers, slashers, grindhouse shockers or anything in between. They do dabble in TV, too, notably ghoulish anthology series Creepshow, and this curious documentary format, that investigates the troubled productions of classic films, from The Exorcist to The Wizard of Oz. It’s a little uneven, but full of fascinating insight. Starzplay: Ramy You’ll have to have access to Amazon, but at £1.99 a month, Starzplay is a bit of a bargain, with a strong catalogue of original series. You’ll already no doubt have heard about Outlander, The Great and the spellbinding Station Eleven, so let’s opt for the less heralded Ramy, a very funny, very insightful comedy about a second-gen Egyptian-American’s attempts to be a good person and a good Muslim. Sundance Now: Good Grief Another Amazon add-on channel – you have to pay £5 a month this time – but it’s probably worth it for The Bureau, which we’ve raved about before, alone. If you’re after a second reason, there’s also Good Grief, a New Zealand comedy about two sisters haplessly running a funeral home, which has a nice line in droll, morbid humour.

4/8/2022,"The board of governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Ampas) is meeting on Friday to consider sanctions against Will Smith after the actor hit Chris Rock at the Oscars on 27 March. Smith has since apologised and resigned from the Academy, which reportedly prompted the Ampas president, David Rubin, to bring forward a board meeting scheduled for 18 April. In his letter to board members, Rubin said that Ampas rules stipulated a 15-day notice to consider suspending a membership, but after Smith’s resignation that no longer applied. After the incident, in which Smith appeared to take exception to a joke aimed at his wife Jada Pinkett Smith, he went on to receive the best actor award for his performance in King Richard. Ampas later said Smith had been asked to leave the ceremony and refused, though later reports suggested that this was not a formal request and that the show’s producer, Will Packer, wanted him to stay. It also emerged that Rubin and the Ampas CEO, Dawn Hudson, held a secret meeting with Smith two days after the Oscars ceremony. Smith is not expected to be stripped of his Oscar – especially given that convicted criminals such as Roman Polanski and Harvey Weinstein have retained theirs – so it is not clear what sanctions other than expulsion remain. A number of high-profile projects associated with Smith appear to have been delayed as producers take stock, with Netflix pausing work on the action thriller Fast and Loose, and Sony reportedly halting development of Bad Boys 4.",Arts/Film,Will Smith: Academy to decide on sanctions against actor for Oscars slap,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/08/will-smith-academy-sanction-oscars-slap
4/8/2022,"A Nobel prize-winning newspaper editor has said he was attacked on a train in Russia by an assailant who poured red paint on him. Dmitry Muratov said the incident happened on Thursday on a train heading from Moscow to Samara. In a post to Novaya Gazeta Europe’s Telegram channel, he said the assailant shouted “Muratov, here’s one for our boys” and that his eyes “are burning terribly” as a result of the assault. He included a selfie taken in a train toilet. Novaya Gazeta Europe is a newly launched project by the staff at Novaya Gazeta, which was Russia’s leading independent newspaper. It announced on 28 March that it was suspending operations for the duration of what it referred to as “the special operation” in Ukraine. That is the term Russian authorities say domestic media outlets must use for the war on Ukraine. The shutdown came after the paper received a second formal warning from Russia’s media regulator, Roskomnadzor. Novaya Gazeta removed much of its war reporting from its website after Russia passed a law threatening jail terms of up to 15 years for information deemed by Russian authorities to be fake. Muratov, the paper’s longtime editor, shared the 2021 Nobel peace prize with Maria Ressa, a journalist from the Philippines. Novaya Gazeta was established by Muratov and colleagues in 1993, and investigated corruption inside and outside Russia, as well as the long wars in Chechnya. Six of the paper’s reporters and contributors have been murdered. In 2021 Novaya Gazeta said its offices in Moscow had been targeted in a chemical attack.

4/8/2022,"The Oklahoma state legislature has been busy. This week, in a surprise move, the state house passed a bill criminalizing all abortions. The bill had been passed by the state senate last year but had been largely abandoned as Oklahoma conservatives sought other, more promising, ways to restrict abortion in the state. As an outright ban on abortions, enforced by the state, the Oklahoma bill that now heads to the governor’s desk for signature would be in plain violation of Roe v Wade, and unlikely to survive a court challenge while that precedent stands. The passage of the bill – which makes abortion a felony and would imprison doctors for up to 10 years per procedure – indicates that the state, like most legal observers, expects the supreme court to overturn Roe soon. The bill, which Oklahoma Republicans voted on while many of their Democratic colleagues were away participating in an abortion and civil rights rally, provides no exceptions for rape or incest. Oklahoma’s governor, Republican Kevin Stitt, has previously stated that he will sign any anti-choice bill that is sent to him. If he signs this one, it will go into effect this summer. The day after the Oklahoma legislature sent the outright ban to Stitt’s desk, Oklahoma’s House Committee on Public Health approved another bill, this one banning abortion at six weeks. That bill is modeled after Texas’ SB8, the abortion ban that the supreme court allowed to go into effect in September, which bypasses Roe by having the ban on abortions be enforced by private lawsuits instead of state prosecution. Instead of imprisoning doctors, as the outright ban would do, this law aims to bankrupt them. The Texas-style bill, SB1503, now heads to the full Oklahoma house for approval. If it becomes law, it will take effect immediately. The moves by Oklahoma come as the state has been playing host to reproductive refugees fleeing neighboring Texas for the past seven months. Ever since the supreme court allowed SB8 to go into effect on 1 September, Texas women in need have been flocking to Oklahoma’s four clinics, enduring the labyrinthine restrictions that Oklahoma already has in place – including an ultrasound, a 72-hour waiting period, and mandatory anti-abortion counseling – at great expense, in order to end their pregnancies. Texans fleeing the state for care have wound up in clinics from California to New York, but more of them have gone to Oklahoma than to any other state. More than half of Texas women who have fled the state for abortions since SB8 went into effect have gotten their care in Oklahoma. The state’s clinics – two in Tulsa, and two in Oklahoma City – have been slammed with these out-of-state visitors. “What we saw very immediately after SB8 is, we doubled our volume,” Kailey Voellinger, the director of a clinic in Oklahoma City, told NBC News. “We went from seeing about 100 to 150 patients to almost 300 in a month.” She says the demand is so great that her clinic has had to turn women away. Now, these new laws might stop her from treating anyone at all. These are the final days of reproductive freedom in America. The supreme court will almost certainly overturn Roe in Dobbs v Jackson this spring. Once it does, 21 states have laws or amendments already in place that would make them certain to ban abortion as quickly as possible, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research group. Twelve states have so-called “trigger bans”, laws that declare abortion illegal as soon as Roe is overturned. Nine have pre-Roe bans that are still on the books, which could go back into effect once Roe is gone. The result is that in the span of a few short weeks, women’s rights are likely to be snuffed out in vast swaths of the country – from the deep south, across the great plains, and into the mountain west, women will lose the freedom, and the dignity, that comes with the right to choose. The human tragedy of this – the dreams that will be denied, the pain that will be endured, the humiliation and the enforced poverty that will inflicted on women forced to become mothers against their interests and against their will – is incalculable. What has the White House done to help mitigate this catastrophe? Very little. When the supreme court allowed SB8 to go into effect, nullifying Roe, Biden promised a “whole-of-government response” to safeguard abortion access. But that whole-of-government response has not materialized. The administration’s reaction to the end of reproductive rights has been tepid and underwhelming. The Department of Justice vowed to step up its enforcement of the Face Act, a law that aims to stop anti-abortion protestors from blocking the entrances to abortion clinics – a nice thought, but one that doesn’t go very far if all those clinics are forced to close. The justice department also sued to block SB8 in the courts, but the supreme court, predictably, threw that out. At the time, legal experts on the left offered ideas for inventive ways that the Biden administration could step in to protect the rights of Texas women – provided that they were willing to bend some norms, and ruffle some feathers, in doing so. The Biden administration declined. Even Biden’s public statements are not especially strongly worded. Throughout his presidency, abortion rights activists have been frustrated with the president’s unwillingness to say the word “abortion”. He prefers euphemisms such as “constitutional rights” or “women’s rights”, and the avoidance, according to some activists, suggests a stigmatizing disdain for the issue. At any rate, as the sun goes down on abortion rights in America, one does not get the impression that Biden will be willing to fight for a right that he is not even willing to name.
