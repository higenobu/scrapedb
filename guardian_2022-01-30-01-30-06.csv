1/30/2022,"Everton have formally offered Frank Lampard the chance to relaunch his managerial career at Goodison Park and hope to conclude contract negotiations with the 43-year-old by Sunday. Lampard has been offered the job of succeeding Rafael Benítez as Everton manager having emerged as the club’s preferred choice following a final round of interviews in London on Friday.  Talks are now underway on the details of Lampard’s contract and the make-up of his immediate backroom team as Everton attempt to resolve their latest managerial search before Monday’s transfer deadline. The club could be in a position to confirm Lampard’s appointment, providing talks run smoothly. The former Chelsea and Derby manager has been out of work since being sacked at Stamford Bridge 12 months ago. He is in line to take over an Everton team that has lost 10 of its last 14 Premier League games and stands just four points above the relegation zone. Lampard’s first game would be the FA Cup fourth round tie at home to Brentford next Saturday with a critical trip to Newcastle in the league three days later. Everton board members, and majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri, interviewed Lampard, Duncan Ferguson and Vítor Pereira on Friday as they sought to conclude another fraught, and at times farcical, managerial search. An immediate move to replace Benitez with their former manager Roberto Martinez was rejected by the Belgian Football Association, who refused to allow their manager to job share in a World Cup year, while Pereira gave a live television interview to defend his record after news of his anticipated appointment by Moshiri sparked a hostile reaction among some Everton fans. Ferguson also impressed Everton’s interview panel in London and has his backers at the club. Lampard, who has been interviewed several times over the past two weeks, was told to expect an offer following the final round. He is set to become Moshiri’s sixth permanent manager in under six years after Ronald Koeman, Sam Allardyce, Marco Silva, Carlo Ancelotti and Benítez. Everton’s owner has also gone through two directors of football in that time and the club are conducting a strategic review into their entire football operation following six years of extravagant spending for little reward. A new midfielder is the priority before the transfer deadline with Abdoulaye Doucouré, Tom Davies and Fabian Delph all sidelined until March with injury.",Sport/Football,Everton offer Frank Lampard manager’s job with deal expected within 24 hours,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/29/everton-offer-frank-lampard-managers-job-with-deal-expected-within-24-hours
1/30/2022,"Ash Barty says she was amazed when it was revealed Evonne Goolagong Cawley was present to hand her the trophy after her Australian Open triumph on Saturday. Tennis Australia did not disclose Goolagong Cawley’s appearance in Melbourne until Todd Woodbridge, the MC, announced her presence.  “I thought she wasn’t coming. I’d spoken to her earlier in the week and she was staying at home and not being able to travel down,” said Barty, smiling. “To have that surprise was amazing. I can’t believe Craig [Tiley] kept it a secret. “It was really special just to be able to give her a hug. It’s the first time I’ve seen her in 12 months. We had a few hugs for a few different reasons, and to be able to see her in the flesh and chat to her was incredible.” Barty, a Ngarigo woman, is the second Indigenous Australian Open champion after Goolagong Cawley. She considers the seven-times grand slam winner an idol and friend who played an important role in her return after she took a hiatus from the sport. “To be able to experience that together on such a big occasion, on such a beautiful court, and in a tournament that means so much to both of us,” Barty said. “It was really nice to have her there just as someone to lean on when I wasn’t really sure what to do. She’s an amazing human being, and I’m very, very lucky to be able to call her a friend. Very lucky to be able to give her a hug in some of the biggest moments in my life.” As Goolagong entered the court to present the trophy to Barty, Cathy Freeman, another of Australia’s most famous Indigenous athletes, was scrambling to take a picture of her. Barty said she did not know Freeman was there and she only glimpsed her after the match had ended. The trio posed for a picture together. “Looking up at the end to see Cathy, she is an inspiration to so many people all around the globe,” said Barty on Channel Nine. “For our heritage and family, she is just the best. To share that tonight with Evonne Goolagong and Cathy, I will never forget it.”",Sport/Sport,Barty ‘amazed’ by Goolagong Cawley surprise after Australian Open win,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/29/ash-barty-amazed-by-goolagong-cawley-surprise-after-australian-open-win
1/30/2022,"Hollie Wright spotted an opportunity. Working in property management, she came across a company that needed to furnish a home for an employee moving in for a few months. What if they could rent everything from one place and pay a subscription? Two decades later, her business, Instant Home, allows people to pay a monthly rent starting at £220 for the basics for a one-bed flat (or £500 for more premium versions). When the rental ends, her company takes everything back.  The furniture rental market has traditionally been about showhomes at property developments. But British department store stalwart John Lewis started experimenting with a service last year, and Wright is finding more and more households ready to lease their interiors. “We’ve got these younger people coming in who are environmentally sensitive, who are much more used to renting things than the older generation,” says Wright. “I think they’ve got their head around not owning everything.” In fact, the subscription economy is on the march through almost every aspect of daily life – from long-established businesses such as pay-per-view TV and car rental to energy, food and even clothing. If you can use it, you can rent it. There are attractions for consumers and businesses. The subscriber avoids the hassle of having to sort out purchase payments every time, or even of having to make a choice; for larger items such as cars, they can avoid a substantial upfront cost. Businesses can lock in repeat purchases and guarantee less volatile earnings (albeit sometimes at the cost of a discount). And there are also potential environmental benefits if items are reused. Here are some subscription models that could be shaping our lives in the years to come. The installation of home solar panels and battery kits at no upfront cost enjoyed a short-lived heyday in the mid-2010s after the government introduced feed-in tariffs for a household’s excess energy. In exchange for receiving a household’s lucrative monthly payments for sending electricity back to the grid, many companies were happy to install solar systems for nothing. The schemes dwindled as subsidies were cut, but two key developments could mean similar deals make a return. First the cost of solar technology has plunged. Second, the government launched its smart export guarantee (SEG) last year, which also pays households for the excess renewable electricity they generate but don’t use. Industry experts believe the scheme could encourage a new breed of ultra-low tariff that allows energy companies to offer solar kits which are paid for using the SEG, while households enjoy lower bills. A boom in smart technology could soon mean electric cars will help to balance the national grid – and make savings on electricity costs. Already Octopus Energy and Ovo Energy have begun offering half-price tariffs for electric vehicle charging. Cars power up when prices are low, during quiet times on the grid, and in return the companies draw electricity from idle car batteries back into the grid when prices are high. By aggregating electric cars and other smart energy devices – such as heat pumps – to create “virtual power plants”, energy firms can earn money by helping to balance the grid when supplies are tight and offer significant savings to customers in return. Experts believe it won’t be long before the savings could be used to cover the cost of installing car chargers, heat pumps or other smart devices at no upfront cost. The UK’s draughty housing stock is among the least energy-efficient in Europe. As climate goals become more pressing, and low-carbon heat pumps are rolled out, homes will need to be as cosy as possible to reduce our energy use. The upfront cost of home energy efficiency measures – such as properly glazed windows and insulating solid walls and lofts – is often out of reach for the households that could benefit most from warmer homes and lower bills. But in the US new business models – such as one pioneered by Sealed – have met the upfront cost of insulation work, and then been repaid from the savings on a home’s energy bills. The UK’s Energy Systems Catapult, a research centre, has been running trials on how home heating solutions could be offered to bill payers as a one-stop monthly service. One of the lasting effects of the pandemic will be the huge numbers of people made comfortable with ordering online – including a wave of sign-ups for meal kit services. Gousto, HelloFresh and Blue Apron are among the companies in different markets that will deliver meal ingredients in various states of preparation for a weekly or monthly fee. Prices start at about £4 a serving. Oddbox offers the enjoyable, if unpredictable, twist of delivering a weekly box of fruit and vegetables that were rejected from supermarkets for aesthetic reasons. Pret a Manger got in on the subscription act during lockdown to try to drive footfall, offering up to five drinks a day for £20 a month. There is a steep cost to keeping up with the latest trends, so it’s perhaps unsurprising that clothing rental has gained most traction at the designer end of the scale. Rent the Runway pioneered the model in the US, charging $135 (£102) per month for eight rented items which can then be returned by post to be used by someone else. In the UK, Eshita Kabra-Davies quit her job at an investment firm in late 2019 to set up By Rotation, which allows users to rent designer clothes from others. The company is still a startup, but already eyeing other big-ticket items such as art or high-end sports gear. “Millennials want access to those items and don’t necessarily need ownership,” Kabra-Davies says. Kabra-Davies said she grew up in Singapore, where leasing more expensive goods like sofas or TVs was common – as it was for decades in the UK, where Radio Rentals became a household name for doing exactly what the name suggests. That model has almost vanished as technology prices have tumbled, but it is making a return – without the eye-watering mark-ups of rent-to-own retailers who tend to target the least wealthy. Apple, the world’s biggest technology company, has already launched its “upgrade programme” – essentially a subscription service for the iPhone. At £37.45 a month (before adding a mobile network contract) the price stacks up quickly, but customers are eligible for the latest model every year. Most Britons are subscribers to the content we consume on these devices in one way or another. Audience measurement firm BARB counts 18.8m households who subscribe to a video streaming service such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video or Disney+, while Spotify has rapidly become the dominant force in the music industry. And of course one business has been relying on the subscription model as long as any: the news industry.",News/Business,"Cars, clothes, carrots … why buy them when you can subscribe?",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/29/cars-clothes-carrots-why-buy-them-when-you-can-subscribe
1/30/2022,"The president of the National Farmers’ Union has accused the government of using British food producers as a “pawn” in post-Brexit trade deals. Minette Batters, who has led the organisation representing British farmers since 2018, said “the most prized food market in the world” had been “handed over for nothing” by ministers, in their rush to sign wide-ranging free-trade agreements with Australia and New Zealand after the UK’s departure from the European Union.  Under the terms of the UK-Australia deal, which was signed in December, Australian beef and lamb farmers will gradually gain more access to the UK market over the first 10 years, before all tariffs and quotas on imported meat are removed. Similar arrangements have been agreed for Australian dairy products, with a five-year transition period, and eight years for sugar. “It does feel like a betrayal,” Batters said in an interview with the Observer. “My greatest fear was that we would be used as a pawn in trade deals and effectively that is what’s happened.” The nation’s food producers said they had been promised by successive environment secretaries, since Michael Gove held the post between 2017 and 2019, that any post-Brexit free-trade deals would include permanent protection for domestic food producers, in the event of a wave of imports. “These are really bad trade deals for the UK because there are no checks and balances, she said. “We were promised as farmers that there would be forever-and-a-day safeguards, so if there was a problem, they could do something about it.” Farmers have long feared that trade deals with food-exporting nations, such as Australia and New Zealand, would lead to a flood of cheaply produced meat, dairy and sugar arriving on British shores, driving down the price of food produced domestically to a higher standard and at a higher cost. NFU members believe these agreements have set a dangerous precedent for talks with much larger food producers such as the United States, Canada and Brazil. Batters disputed the suggestion by some ministers that UK farmers need to be more ambitious and export more of their produce. She insisted there will not be any demand for British beef and lamb in Australia, which has much larger farms, combined with a smaller population, and a higher cost of living than the UK. Batters criticised what she described as the “adversarial” approach required to negotiate with government. Food producers have pleaded for the allocation of a higher number of seasonal worker visas in the first few years following Brexit, to ease the transition from a reliance on temporary EU workers. Labour shortages following Brexit and Covid have already resulted in unpicked fruit rotting in fields, and a cull of healthy pigs on farms, because of a lack of staff at slaughterhouses. The seasonal worker scheme has been extended by the government until 2024, allowing 30,000 foreign workers to come to the UK to help with fruit, crops and – from this year – plants such as daffodils. The government has retained the option of increasing the number of visas by 10,000 if required, but this still falls short of the total requested by food producers. “We’ve had to fight so hard for what we’ve achieved,” Batters said, adding that the industry works in “partnership” with government in other countries, including Australia and New Zealand, where farmers are included in trade missions. Ministers in Westminster are far removed from farmers and rural communities, Batters said. “Agriculture underpins the entire rural economy. In some very fragile parts of the country, if you didn’t have agriculture, the village schools, the local community, the allied trades, the local veterinary practice, the auction market, are all put at risk.”",News/Environment,NFU president: farmers are pawns in Brexit negotiations,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/29/nfu-president-farmers-are-pawns-in-brexit-negotiations
1/30/2022,"Everyone knows by now that a distinctively British style of jazz emerged in the 1960s, and it’s often said that Stan Tracey’s Under Milk Wood suite (1965) was its first unmistakable masterpiece. The 1959 Sessions, from a tape recently unearthed during a studio clear-out, is six years pre-masterpiece but welcome nonetheless. As both pianist and composer, Tracey developed his style under the twin influences of Ellington and Monk. This set him apart from the usual run of modern jazz in the 50s, and there was always the slight doggedness of the loner about him. Of the eight tracks here, three are standard songs, one a venerable jazz number and four are Tracey originals. The songs bring out the Monkishness – displaced accents, sudden excursions into unlikely keys – all performed with faultless accuracy. The originals are more intriguing, because in each one the improvised solos grow inseparably out of the tune. The best of the lot, for me, is the splendid, up-tempo Pitter, Patter, Panic. Technically, it’s not a perfect recording, even for 1959, but it shows that, by the start of the 60s, Tracey was already a force to be reckoned with.

1/30/2022,"Derby isn’t known as a tourist hotspot. Often overshadowed by nearby Nottingham, bypassed on the road to the Peak District, locals here know the hotels are quietest at weekends when visiting business folk leave. That hasn’t stopped its leaders making a tilt to become UK City of Culture 2025. Bidding to reinvigorate civic pride and economic growth after the fallout from Covid-19, the aim here is to showcase the city’s unique industrial heritage as a crucible for the art of manufacturing.  “It’s our version of the Olympics,” says Adam Buss, the chief executive of the city’s Quad arts venue and bid director for the 2025 campaign. “We’ve always lived a bit in the shadows – maybe people go past on the M1, or the train. But what we want to say with City of Culture is ‘Stop! Come here.’” Pitting itself against seven other places – including Southampton, Bradford, Stirling and the entire county of Cornwall – Derby hopes to replicate some of the economic growth, investment and feelgood factor enjoyed by previous winners such as Hull and Derry-Londonderry. With final bids for the longlisted entrants due this week, it comes as ministers prepare to launch the government’s long-awaited “levelling up” blueprint for townslike Derby – with a white paper from Michael Gove’s department expected within days. As the city puts its cultural offering in the shop window, there is also cause for concern. Its most high-profile attraction – Derby County football club – is in trouble, at risk of collapsing into liquidation with unsustainable debts. “It would be catastrophic if something significant happened,” says Buss. Losing the Championship side managed by Wayne Rooney would hit the city’s cultural heft on the national stage. “It should be a wake-up call for the UK and the rest of the football world.” Locals know the city of culture bid might raise one or two eyebrows, coming from a place often bypassed by big-name musicians on tour. Most big acts play at Nottingham Rock City, requiring a trip down Brian Clough Way – a stretch of the A52 named after the football manager celebrated for bringing success to both cities despite a fierce rivalry between the two. Derby’s largest venue – the Assembly Rooms – has remained derelict since fire ripped through the brutalist building in 2014. But critics miss the point, says Buss. “It’s a bit like Hull. A lot of their messaging said, ‘It’s OK to criticise us, but do you know us? Have you been here? Do you understand what’s going on?’” Rather than a prize for the most vibrant place in Britain, the city of culture award is best understood as an arts-led catalyst for rebooting the fortunes of overlooked places that have untapped potential. In Derby, the plan is to show that its industry and artistic prowess are vital ingredients for economic and cultural success, and why some of Britain’s biggest manufacturers – including Rolls-Royce, Toyota and Alstom – still call the place home long after John Lombe built the world’s first fully mechanised factory here on the River Derwent in the 1700s. Chris Cholerton, president of civil aerospace at Rolls-Royce, who sits on the global firm’s executive leadership team, is Derby born and bred. A season ticket holder at Pride Park, he fears for the football club’s future. “We sometimes joke – and it is probably just a joke – that the productivity on Monday mornings at the factory is always far higher when Derby has won. We’re a football city. It’s a big piece of our fabric, so we’re hoping it all works out.” The engineering giant has called Derby home since 1908, employing about 12,000 people to design, manufacture and test its Trent jet engines built to propel Airbus and Boeing passenger aircraft around the world. Rolls suffered an unprecedented hit during the pandemic as planes were grounded, forcing it to cut 9,000 jobs globally – including in Derby. Production volumes have halved, but the firm still picked its historic home to consolidate to when making cuts to save money. In the vast engine assembly hall, equipment used to put together the jet turbine blades – each thin twist of metal harnesses the power of an F1 car – is waiting to be put to use. While the local arts scene isn’t a big reason to come back, Cholerton says culture can play an important role. “As we go forward in decarbonising aviation, it won’t be static; we need to attract more engineers. That continuing ability to attract talent and retain it – with both a great working environment and a great city to live in – is very powerful.” Manufacturing still accounts for a quarter of Derby’s economy, well above the national average and more than double that of other industrial revolution crucibles such as Manchester, Glasgow or Birmingham. In a place where Joseph Wright expressed the industrial age through painting in the 18th century, that is a reminder that culture takes many forms and isn’t always the type found in a grand gallery or opulent theatre. Down the road at Alstom, the French multinational manufacturer is building monorail carriages destined for the Cairo metro in engine sheds dating back to 1876. As one of Britain’s biggest railway hubs, the firm uses its base here to design and manufacture its latest models; including those for HS2 and London’s new Elizabeth line. Nick Crossfield, Alstom’s UK and Ireland managing director, says younger employees increasingly choose where they want to work before looking at the industry they want to work in. Sprucing up Derby’s cultural sites will be key to attracting coders and developers, as well as graphic designers, to a city that already has status in the gaming industry as the birthplace of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. “The facilities, the institutions, the profile that Derby has is really important to us,” he says. While hopes are high for the cultural bid, Derby has suffered years of austerity directed from Westminster, with the local council being forced to cut 50 jobs to find budget savings of more than £13m next year. Towns and cities outside London and the south-east have had harsher cuts to culture, with council funding for arts down 38.5% in a decade. According to the Fabian Society, Arts Council England National Lottery funds contributed the equivalent of £50.40 per person to organisations based in London, compared with £21.26 per head for the rest of England. There are no guarantees of extra lottery money for the winning city of culture bid. But previous title-holder Coventry secured £16m of government funding, while Hull received £15m. A government spokesperson said the format of the 2025 competition hadn’t changed, while it could also be a catalyst for inward investment. Buss says the expectation is that funders will come forward. However, his biggest hope is that Derby can become a focal point for tackling big cultural and economic challenges facing the UK in the 21st century, from climate change to technology. “The start of the industrial revolution happened here. But if you ask people where they’d go in the country for answers to big challenges, they might not say Derby. City of culture can give us that beacon.”",News/UK news,Derby hopes its culture club bid will power up industrial mecca,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/29/derby-hopes-its-culture-club-bid-will-power-up-industrial-mecca
1/30/2022,"Once upon a time, a very long time ago – until Thursday 28 October 2021, to be precise – the term “metaverse” was known only to lexicographers and science fiction enthusiasts. And then, suddenly, it was everywhere. How come? Simply this: Mark Zuckerberg, the supreme leader of Facebook, pissed off by seeing nothing but bad news about his company in the media, announced that he was changing its name to Meta and would henceforth be devoting all his efforts – plus $10bn (£7bn) and thousands of engineers – to building a parallel universe called the metaverse. And then, because the tech industry and the media that chronicle its doings are basically herds of mimetic sheep, the metaverse was suddenly the newest new thing. This was news to Neal Stephenson, the writer who actually invented the term in his 1992 novel, Snow Crash. “Since there seems to be growing confusion on this,” he tweeted, “I have nothing to do with anything that FB is up to involving the metaverse, other than the obvious fact that they’re using a term I coined in Snow Crash. There has been zero communication between me and FB & no biz relationship.”  In a 2017 interview with Vanity Fair, Stephenson modestly said of Snow Crash that he was “just making shit up”. If so, some shit. The book is not just a great read, but eerily prescient. It’s set in a US where the government has more or less disintegrated and where everything is run by corporations that function like principalities in medieval Europe. The CIA has merged with the Library of Congress to become the CIC, a for-profit outfit that knows everything (Palantir, anyone?) The novel opens with an unforgettable car chase in which the main character, Hiro Protagonist, who works for the mafia’s pizza delivery conglomerate, races desperately to deliver a pizza on time (Deliveroo?). Failure to deliver within 30 minutes of an order being placed earns you a death sentence. So the chase is a life-and-death struggle as Hiro races his GPS-enabled electric car through the streets of Los Angeles before he runs out the clock and faces the anger of the mob. And this was written in the early 1990s. But the really intriguing thing about the new obsession with metaverse(s) is that it seems to have missed the point that the future envisaged in Stephenson’s novel is a deeply, deeply dystopian one. His metaverse is a vision of how a virtual-reality-based internet, resembling a massively multiplayer online game, might evolve. Like many multiplayer games, it’s populated by user-controlled avatars, as well as system demons. And status in this virtual world is a function of two things: access to restricted environments such as the Black Sun, an exclusive metaverse club, and technical acumen, which is often demonstrated by the sophistication of one’s avatar. The irony of this metaphor being solemnly valorised by the boss of a powerful tech corporation seems to be lost on the industry. The original video in which Zuckerberg shows himself in the metaverse defies parody. “Imagine,” he burbles, “you put on your glasses or headset and you’re instantly in your home space [sic]. There’s part of your physical home recreated virtually. It has things that are only possible virtually and it has an incredibly inspiring view of whatever you find most beautiful.” It goes on like this for 11 minutes. Do keep a sick bag handy in case you decide to have a look. If it were a spoof, you’d give it full marks, but apparently it’s intended to be serious. And because Zuck is surrounded by the reality-distortion field created by vast wealth, other apparently rational tech moguls are scrambling to pay homage to his fantasy. The other day, for example, Microsoft, hitherto a serious computer company, laid out nearly $70bn of shareholders’ money to buy computer gaming company Activision Blizzard. Various rationalisations have been proposed for this splurge. The logical one is that computer gaming is a huge industry in which Microsoft already has a significant presence. Owning Activision, which makes some of the most popular titles, including Call of Duty and Candy Crush Saga, would make it an even bigger player. QED. But there is another, more intriguing interpretation, which is that Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, has caught the metaverse bug. For one thing, metaverses are, by Stephenson’s definition, basically immersive virtual-reality environments and the games industry specialises in creating just such environments. For another, Nadella has been heard burbling about his desire to create an “enterprise metaverse”. At which prospect, fevered visions loom – of avatars of tech moguls in pinstripe suits and chinos stalking one another in virtual boardrooms, doing battle with lightsabers. And then one realises that such folk have no need of a parallel universe, meta or otherwise. They already live in one.

1/30/2022,"Snow fell lightly as Joe Biden stared into the wooded hollow where, just hours before he arrived in Pittsburgh, a half-century old bridge had collapsed. It was a dramatic illustration of what had brought the president to the City of Bridges: his urgent drive to rebuild crumbling US infrastructure.  Last year, Biden signed a $1tn infrastructure bill, an achievement that eluded his most recent predecessors and one he was eager to champion after legislative setbacks. “There are another 3,300 bridges here in Pennsylvania, some of which are just as old and just as in decrepit a condition as that one was,” Biden said later, in a speech at a manufacturing research and development center. Funding in the infrastructure law would help repair the Pittsburgh bridge and “thousands of other bridges across the country”. “We’ve got to move,” he said. “The next time, we don’t need headlines saying that someone was killed.” The visit to Pittsburgh was the beginning of an effort by the White House to change the narrative of Biden’s presidency, as he shifts from an inaugural year mired in legislative battles to elections that will determine control of Congress. The new approach was a recognition of a stalled agenda, an unyielding pandemic, rising inflation and flagging popularity. Yet the week brought a much-needed burst of good news, a reminder that the electoral landscape may look very different come November. The supreme court justice Stephen Breyer announced his retirement, giving Biden the opportunity to name his replacement. The commerce department reported that the US economy grew last year at its fastest pace since 1984. US households began receiving free coronavirus tests from the government. And suddenly, after months of gridlock, the administration is optimistic Congress will pass a plan aimed at making the US more competitive against China. Democratic strategists, progressive activists and former party officials welcomed Biden’s use of the bully pulpit, urging him to seize such momentum by touting economic success and drawing sharp contrasts with Republicans. “In the districts, people can’t tell you a thing that’s in Build Back Better but they can tell you to the penny how much a tank of gas is,” said Chuck Rocha, a progressive Democratic strategist. “They can also tell you what their relief check meant to them.” “We just have to not be afraid to beat our chest as Democrats,” he said. Historical patterns suggest Republicans are well-positioned to win the House and possibly the Senate in November. The party that holds the White House typically loses seats during its first midterm elections, the extent of such losses often correlating with a president’s popularity. Biden will use time away from Washington to build support for his legislative priorities while highlighting what his administration has accomplished: a poverty reducing coronavirus stimulus package, the infrastructure law, full vaccination of more than 210 million Americans. Strategists say his travels may remind Americans why they voted for him. Biden began his presidency with high approval ratings and broad public confidence in his ability to confront the pandemic. But the national mood darkened, sending Biden’s popularity spiraling, including among Black, Latino, female and young voters – core segments of his coalition. A survey by Pew Research this week found the president’s approval rating down to 41%, from a high of 59% in April. “We need to get Biden’s approval numbers up or else we’re toast in the midterms,” warned Lanae Erickson, senior vice-president at the moderate think tank Third Way. Disappointment with Biden’s handling of the pandemic is a key factor weighing down such ratings. Now that vaccines have proven effective, including against fast-spreading variants like Omicron, Erickson said voters want to hear the White House strategy for living with the virus. “Right now people are hearing a lot of ‘Stay home, stay safe’ from Democrats. But people are tired of staying home,” she said. “We have to be the party that’s talking about getting people back to work.” Biden’s relatively infrequent travel during his first year in office was partly due to the pandemic. But he was also grounded by negotiations on Capitol Hill. In September, the White House canceled a trip to Chicago so Biden could hammer out a deal on his domestic spending package, only to see such efforts collapse soon after. This month, Biden’s visit to Capitol Hill to pressure Democrats to pass voting rights protections was forestalled by Senator Kyrsten Sinema, who declared her opposition to changing the filibuster, thereby dooming the legislation, in a speech just before the president’s arrival. Biden appeared to acknowledge that his involvement with negotiations on Capitol Hill hurt his standing with voters, who wanted to see him govern more like a commander-in-chief. Defending his reputation as a bipartisan dealmaker, built over 36 years in the Senate, Biden conceded that the role of president required a different type of engagement. “The public doesn’t want me to be the ‘president-senator,’” he told reporters this month. “They want me to be the president and let senators be senators.” The retirement of Justice Breyer immediately put a spotlight on one of the most consequential responsibilities of any presidency: filling a vacancy on the supreme court. At a press conference this week, Biden said he would draw up a list of candidates based on his promise to nominate a Black woman. Stefanie Brown James, co-founder and executive director of the Collective Pac, which aims to build Black electoral power, said the assurance “felt monumental”, particularly after the disappointments on domestic spending and voting rights. Though the replacement would do little to shift the ideological composition of the court, after three Trump-era appointments created a conservative supermajority, James said appointing a Black woman would “right a historic wrong”. Antjuan Seawright, a South Carolina Democratic strategist, said the chance for Biden to add a woman of color could be a “galvanizing” moment for Democrats, a reminder to supporters Biden can still deliver on his promises. “The president won because of our votes, Black voters, the most consequential and loyal voting bloc in the country,” Seawright said. “And so this is going to remind them of the net worth of their vote and why it’s important to keep showing up.” A natural retail politician with a zeal for campaigning, Biden lamented that he had so few opportunities to “look people in the eye” in his first year as president. On Tuesday, he stepped out of the White House to visit a boutique that opened during the pandemic, purchasing a necklace for his wife and a coffee mug featuring the face of Kamala Harris, his vice-president. The excursion also included a stop for ice-cream, where he posed with employees after greeting US Marines. On Wednesday, Biden bantered with the General Motors chief executive, Mary Barra, about the speed of a new electric vehicle, during a White House roundtable with the heads of major US companies. “I’m looking for a job, Mary,” quipped the president, a car enthusiast, after Barra told him the vehicle went from “zero to 60 in three seconds”. Next week, Biden will travel to New York to discuss plans for combatting gun crime with Mayor Eric Adams, after the fatal shooting of two police officers. The White House has sought to elevate efforts to combat rising violent crime as Republicans attempt to portray the country as lawless. Centrist Democrats believe Adams, a retired NYPD captain who campaigned on a promise to reduce crime, offers a model for how the party can beat back such attacks. The White House insists the president hasn’t given up on passing Biden’s Build Back Better agenda or voting protections, but is scaling back his involvement – and his ambitions. Activists and progressives are pressing him to ramp up use of his executive authority. Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez, president of NextGen America, a youth voting organization, said canceling student debt was one of the “most basic and critical” steps Biden could take to deliver for young people. She said the issue was a top priority for voters under 35, and would help fulfil a promise to reduce the racial wealth gap. Biden has expressed doubt whether he has the legal authority to enact widespread student loan forgiveness. In December, he extended a moratorium on student loan payments put in place by the Trump administration in the early days of the pandemic. “Young folks overwhelmingly supported the Biden administration and now it’s up to the Biden administration to support young people,” Tzintzún Ramirez said. “We understand they can’t pass every single policy but on student debt they hold the power to make it happen.” If Biden’s standing slips further, his visits could become a political headache for Democrats in battleground states. On Friday, a leading Democratic contender in the Pennsylvania governor’s race was noticeably absent from Biden’s Pittsburgh event, citing a scheduling conflict. Earlier in the month, Stacey Abrams, the leading Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia, also cited a scheduling conflict for her absence at Biden’s Atlanta speech on voting rights, which was boycotted by some civil rights groups. Beto O’Rourke said he was “not interested” in help from the president or any national politician in his bid to become governor of Texas. Ed Rendell, a former governor of Pennsylvania, said Biden was still the “best messenger to motivate our rank-and-file Democrats” in battleground states. But Rendell said the time for bipartisan backslapping had passed. Biden’s message to voters, he said, must be clear: Republicans, not Democrats, are squarely to blame for his stalled agenda. “We have to fight back with the weapons at our disposal,” Rendell said. “We’d rather negotiate peace … but we’re not going to fight with a hand tied behind our back.”",News/US news,‘We have to fight back’: can Joe Biden recover before the midterms?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/29/joe-biden-midterm-elections-ratings-pittsburgh-bridge-collapse-infrastructure
1/30/2022,"James Blunt has jokily threatened to release new music on Spotify if the audio streaming service does not remove a podcast by the US commentator Joe Rogan that has been criticised for promoting anti-vax views. The English singer-songwriter wrote on Twitter on Saturday:  If @spotify doesn’t immediately remove @joerogan, I will release new music onto the platform. #youwerebeautiful When a Twitter user queried whether Blunt meant instead to say he would not release new music, another user commented: “He means he will. It’s a common joke of James’s on Twitter that his releasing music is a negative thing for the world.” Blunt’s comments come after Joni Mitchell became the second high-profile musician after Neil Young to remove their music from Spotify in protest against the platform’s promotion of the podcast The Joe Rogan Experience. Young had demanded Spotify take down his songs unless episodes of the podcast he considered to contain false information about Covid vaccines were removed. The Canadian-American musician publicly accused Spotify on Monday of “spreading fake information about vaccines – potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them”. “They can have Rogan or Young. Not both,” he said. Many of Young’s fans and supporters of his pro-vaccine stance called for other artists to follow his lead. The hashtags “I stand with Neil Young” and “CancelSpotify” were soon trending on social media. Mitchell, 78, said removing her music from the platform was an act of “solidarity with Neil Young and the global scientific and medical communities”. “Irresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives,” she said. Spotify began to remove Young’s music on Friday, saying it regretted the move and hoped he would return to the platform soon. Blunt added the hashtag #youwerebeautiful to his intervention on Twitter, in reference to his 2005 song You’re Beautiful.",Arts/Music,James Blunt jokes he will release new music on Spotify in Rogan protest,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/29/james-blunt-twitter-spotify-joe-rogan-podcast-neil-young
1/30/2022,"A 35-year-old man has been convicted of stalking the tennis player Emma Raducanu. Amrit Magar was convicted at Bromley magistrates court on Friday and will be sentenced next month.  The court heard how Magar, a former Amazon delivery driver, visited Raducanu’s home three times and stole one of her father’s shoes as a “souvenir”. He tracked down the US Open champion’s London home address and left notes, flowers and Christmas decorations, according to the Daily Mail. In a statement to the court, Raducanu, 19, said the ordeal had left her feeling afraid to go out alone. “Since all this has happened I have felt creeped out. I feel very apprehensive if I go out, especially if I am on my own,” she said in a statement reported by the Mail. “Because of this I feel like my freedom has been taken away from me. I am constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel on edge and worried this could happen again. I don’t feel safe in my own home, which is where I should feel safest.” Magar, from Edgware, north London, discovered Raducanu’s address by travelling to the London suburb where she lives with her parents and asking people for directions. He then left her messages, including a map he had drawn showing the distance he had walked from north London to her address, with a note attached reading: “23 miles walked 4 you.” On Magar’s last visit to the property in early December, he decorated a tree in the front garden with Christmas lights and stole a shoe belonging to Raducanu’s father from the porch, believing it to belong to the tennis player. He was caught by Ian Raducanu, who recognised him from previous visits and followed him by car while calling the police. After being arrested with the shoe in his bag, Magar, 35, told police he had wanted a souvenir. The tennis player told police: “I want to move to a new house with better security because I am worried he might come back as he knows where my home is.” In evidence on Friday, Magar said he was ashamed to learn that his actions had upset Raducanu. The district judge Sushil Kumar said: “His inability to explain how he did not think this was harassment is incapable of belief.” Magar was bailed on the condition that he does not contact Raducanu or her parents or visit their street.",News/UK news,Man guilty of stalking Emma Raducanu after leaving notes at her home,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/29/man-guilty-of-stalking-emma-raducanu-after-leaving-notes-at-her-home

The favourite’s jumping was a little sloppy at times but his win was still a significant improvement on his disappointing performance when favourite for the King George VI Chase on Boxing Day and confirms him as a likely runner in the Cheltenham Gold Cup on 18 March.  “Nothing gives me more pleasure than doing that and it’s lovely that it’s at Cheltenham, it’s not at Ballygobackwards,” Nicky Henderson, Chantry House’s trainer, said. “It’s here in a proper race at Cheltenham and well done JP, he’s been an amazing friend and supporter. JP sends me some seriously lovely horses, and my job is to try to get them here.” Henderson was looking completed a double on the day as Champ, another runner in the McManus colours, set off as favourite for the Cleeve Hurdle but he could not reel in Paisley Park, the 2019 Stayers’ Hurdle winner, after the two horses were in the air together at the final flight.
