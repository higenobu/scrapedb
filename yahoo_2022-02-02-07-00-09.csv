2/2/2022,"McConnell was asked how many Black women he has on staff and how they inform his thinking on SCOTUS nominations. ""Actually, I haven't checked. We don't have a racial quota,"" he said in response. But he also said he's hired Black people before for numerous different jobs, ""including speechwriter."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell fielded a question on Tuesday about the number of Black women on his staff, and how they might inform his decision on President Joe Biden's impending Supreme Court nominee. ""Actually, I haven't checked, we don't have a racial quota in my office,"" he told reporter Pablo Manriquez about how many Black women he employs. ""But I've had a number of African American employees, both male and female, over the years, in all kinds of different positions, including speechwriter,"" McConnell went on to say. Biden has pledged to nominate the first Black woman to the nation's highest court to replace the retiring liberal Justice Stephen Breyer. A number of potential candidates have already emerged and Biden said he plans to announce his decision by the end of February. —The Recount (@therecount) February 1, 2022 McConnell's comments come as a number of Republicans in his caucus — including Sens. Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Ted Cruz of Texas — have criticized Biden, with Wicker saying the president's nominee would be a ""beneficiary"" of affirmative action. Cruz, for his part, went even further. ""The fact that he's willing to make a promise at the outset, that it must be a Black woman, I gotta say that's offensive. You know, Black women are what, 6% of the US population? He's saying to 94% of Americans, 'I don't give a damn about you, you are ineligible,'"" Cruz said recently on his podcast, ""Verdict with Ted Cruz."" But previous Republican presidents have made similar promises, with both former President Donald Trump and even the late President Ronald Reagan pledging to nominate women to the court. It's unclear how many Black staffers McConnell currently has on staff, and his office did not respond to Insider's request for comment on that point. McConnell recently misspoke during a separate conference, telling reporters that ""African American voters are voting in just as high a percentage as Americans,"" seemingly implying that the two are separate categories. He later said the remarks contained an ""inadvertent omission,"" while also slamming his critics. ""I've never been accused of this kind of thing before. It's hurtful, it's offensive, and it's total nonsense,"" McConnell told reporters in Kentucky. Read the original article on Business Insider",Politics/INSIDER,"Sen.

2/2/2022,"WASHINGTON — Nancy Mace began using marijuana after she was raped in high school. “There was no light in my life,” Mace told Yahoo News of that time. “I dropped out of school, became a waitress at Waffle House.” She eventually returned to school with newfound determination, becoming the first woman to graduate from the Citadel in 1999. After working in South Carolina politics, she won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018, becoming only the second woman to represent the state in Washington. Now, she is using her newfound national clout to help legalize the drug that helped her through the trauma of sexual assault with legislation that decriminalizes and taxes the drug, with a 3 percent “sin tax” (also known as an excise tax) similar to those once in place for tobacco and alcohol. In effect, the States Reform Act, as the legislation is known, would treat cannabis like alcohol instead of heroin. “When you poll on this issue, when you put it on the ballot, there is overwhelming support regardless of your political affiliation,” Mace told Yahoo News in a recent interview. In fact, legalizing cannabis appears to have become the least controversial issue in a society riven by controversies, with a recent Pew poll showing 91 percent of Americans favoring legalization. Cannabis (the word “marijuana” has fallen out of favor, in part because of its racialized connotations) is already legal for medical use in 37 states; 18 states allow recreational use, too. However, the federal government still classifies the drug in the same Schedule I category as LSD and ecstasy, so that essential functions like banking are difficult to obtain for dispensaries even in states where cannabis is legal. Mace’s proposal is one of a number of cannabis-related proposals now being considered by Congress. A roadblock to much of that legislation has been Sen. Chuck Schumer, who has his own ambitious cannabis reform bill that he favors above more modest proposals that would, for example, make use of the federal banking system easier for cannabis-related businesses. Schumer even stripped a banking-related provision from last year’s defense bill, infuriating House members who’d introduced and supported the measure. “I don’t really quite know what the hell his problem is,” Rep. Jim McGovern said of Schumer at the time. Advocates continue to make their case, seeing Democratic control of Congress as a prime opportunity for actions. But with the pandemic disrupting ordinary legislative business and other progressive priorities on hand, it is not obvious that cannabis will get the hearing it deserves. An analyst for Bloomberg described the interest for reform as “lukewarm.” Mace says says the Democrats have committed to a hearing on her bill, which would let states regulate cannabis as they see fit. “It’s going to be the most palatable in a bipartisan way,” she told Yahoo News. The cultural politics of the issue are fascinating, putting a traditional conservative like Mace in the same boat as libertarian Sen. Rand Paul and progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Yet the president’s own newfound progressivism has not extended to a drug whose legalization has been tied to redressing the racial disparities of the Nixon-era war on drugs. Last year, the White House came under fire for dismissing five staffers who admitted to using cannabis in the past. The issue is far less popular with Republicans (47 percent in favor, according to Pew) than it is with Democrats (72 percent), meaning that Mace’s position is not without risk. The issue is not nearly as settled politically in South Carolina as it is in some other states, with legalization a matter of pointed contention in the upcoming gubernatorial race. After she introduced the bill, Mace was rebuked by the South Carolina chairman of the Republican Party, who denounced “any effort to legalize, decriminalize the use of controlled substances.” Mace says she isn’t afraid to go it alone, though some Republicans in the House do support her proposal. “If you operate that way, you’ll never get anything done,” she told Yahoo News. In her short time in Washington, Mace has gone her own way a number of times, charting a course that is neither slavishly pro-Trump nor committed to the Kinzinger-Cheney model of internal resistance. She has clashed with both progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and MAGA loyalist Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, whom she dismissed with an instantaneously classic Southernism: “bless her f***ing heart.” While that kind of rhetoric has grabbed headlines, it has not necessarily endeared her to GOP leadership. “I don’t really understand the game she's playing,” one House Republican confessed to Politico last fall. The moment’s complex crosscurrents could hand Mace an unexpected victory, given that both parties will need something to campaign on next fall. Or, those same dynamics could leave Mace with a failed bill that attracts enmity from Republicans without garnering much favor with moderate Democrats. Yet the effort did get a major boost last month with an endorsement from Amazon, which has become increasingly involved in Washington affairs (founder Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post, as well as the biggest residence in the district) “Like so many in this country, we believe it’s time to reform the nation’s cannabis policy and Amazon is committed to helping lead the effort,” an account affiliated with the company’s lobbying efforts tweeted last month. It’s a single tweet, but one that represents a corporate giant setting up shop in northern Virginia. The message gave her proposal “great momentum going into the start of this year,” Mace said. “I foresee other companies being encouraged to support the bill moving forward.” Given the cultural imprimatur of giants like Amazon, such corporate avowals could prove more auspicious for her bill than the entreaties of activists have had in other efforts. So far, though, efforts at drug reform are proceeding largely at the state level, with little resembling national policy in evidence. Maine is moving to potentially decriminalize psilocybin (more commonly known as “magic mushrooms”), which the District of Columbia decriminalized last year. There is even a push to legalize LSD, with evidence mounting that psychedelic drugs — long caricatured as a hippie habit — can successfully treat some severe mental illnesses. Just about half of all Americans have tried cannabis in some form, and even though concerns remain about heavy use by teenagers, cannabinoids — the psychoactive compounds in the buds of the cannabis plant — appear to also help with a variety of ailments. Mace says she had recently spoken to a mother whose 14-year-old daughter is afflicted with cerebral palsy and suffers from a series of unremitting seizures each day. Cannabis helps, even in the “trace amounts” the mother says she has been administering. “We have the best cannabis of the world,” she says of the United States, envisioning a kind of emergence that the moribund American wine industry that took place after a famous 1976 tasting in Paris saw California vintages beat out their continental counterparts. “Let’s start right here.”",Politics/Yahoo News,'We have the best cannabis of the world': Rep.

2/2/2022,"The teen who went viral for tracking Elon Musk's private jet got a job offer out of the saga. The New York Post said Jack Sweeney was offered work with Stratos Jet Charters for his ""creativity"" with the @ElonJet Twitter account. Musk previously offered Sweeney $5,000 to shut down the account and has since blocked the teen. The teen who went viral for tracking Elon Musk's private jet on Twitter has gotten a job offer out of that pursuit. Jack Sweeney, 19, has been offered work with Orlando-based private charter flight company Stratos Jet Charters, the New York Post first reported Tuesday. ""It was pretty cool. They're UCF [University of Central Florida] alumni, so it's pretty interesting,"" Sweeney told the Post of the job opportunity. Stratos President and CEO Joel Thomas told the Post the company offered Sweeney work on its development team after seeing his ""creativity"" in starting the Twitter account Elon Musk's Jet. Thomas confirmed to Insider that the company reached out to Sweeney about employment. ""Seeing Jack's interest in private aviation along with his adroit tech capability, I opened the door to him to join our development team,"" Thomas said. ""Understanding that he is currently enrolled at UCF, Stratos is happy to work with him on a project basis, part-time or internship to help him further his educational goals.""

""I see Jack as having both a passion for aviation and for tech,"" Thomas continued. ""I believe this is the recipe to help Stratos continue to raise the bar that others are chasing."" Sweeney also confirmed to Insider that he received the offer but said he isn't likely to accept given his current work at UberJets, where he's building a platform to track chartered flights to help find cheaper seats for clients. ""I already work for UberJets and I'm on an NDA, so I can't really take it,"" he said. Sweeney and his @ElonJet Twitter account went viral last month after Protocol reported that Musk had offered the teen $5,000 last fall to take down the account. Messages between Sweeney and Musk showed the Tesla and SpaceX CEO calling the account ""a security risk"" and saying, ""I don't love the idea of being shot by a nutcase."" Musk had said earlier in January that social media accounts tracking his movements were ""becoming a security issue."" Sweeney asked to bump the offer up to $50,000; Musk said he'd think about it and later said it didn't ""feel right"" to pay to take down the account. Sweeney recently told Insider's Isobel Asher Hamilton that he enjoys maintaining the account too much to give it up for $5,000. On Monday, Sweeney told Bloomberg that Musk blocked all social media accounts linked to the teen over the weekend.

2/2/2022,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — The owners of a New Mexico home were doubly surprised over the weekend to find a burglar in their house with an AR-15, and then to have him apologize, give them money and leave embarrassed. The man had slept, bathed, dined and had some beer at the home on the outskirts of Santa Fe before the owners returned and discovered him, according to a Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office police report cited by the Albuquerque Journal. He had an AR-15 scoped rifle but didn't threaten them, or take any of their jewelry or other belongings. Instead, he gave the homeowners $200 as “reimbursement for the window he broke,” the report said. The suspect — about 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall and in his late 20s — also shared a bit of his story, telling the owners he was running from someone and that his family had been killed in east Texas, according to the report. He said his car had broken down outside Santa Fe. The homeowners told authorities the man was ""extremely embarrassed and apologetic about the situation,” the report states. The suspect left the home with his duffel bag and gun, walking down a ditch. His alleged larcenies totaled $15, the report said. Sheriff’s deputies came to the home and searched the ditch but didn’t find anyone.",U.S./Associated Press,"Embarrassed burglar leaves $200, flees home with his AR-15",https://news.yahoo.com/embarrassed-burglar-leaves-200-flees-204321296.html
2/2/2022,"The rapid rise in mortgage rates in January created a bit of a panic among some homebuyers, according to one expert, but the increase won’t be enough to stop the hot housing market. “It's spooked a number of homebuyers because they didn't expect it. They thought that affordability window was going to stay open forever,” Barbara Corcoran, founder of the Corcoran Group and Shark Tank guru, recently told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). “The real million-dollar question that every buyer has is, is the worst over? Or are we going to get surprise after surprise after surprise?” Last week, the rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage — the most popular home loan for buyers — came in at 3.55%, slightly lower than the 3.56% the previous week, but still among the highest levels since March 2020, according to Freddie Mac. The rate is more than a half-point higher than a month ago. Calling the increase negligible, Corcoran noted that applications to purchase a home increased after mortgages rose. Additionally, December — traditionally the slowest part of the year for real estate — broke historic norms, she added. The number of homes for sale fell — instead of increased — forcing prices higher. Total housing inventory dropped 18% in December from the month before to 910,000 units, according to the National Association of Realtors, the lowest level since 1999 when the trade group started tracking the data. Unsold inventory sat at a 1.8-month supply, down from 2.1 months in November. Six months of supply is considered a balanced market. “As long as [rates] don’t continue up, up, up, up, up, up, which everybody is saying they won't…I just think we're going to have such a robust market continuing right through the following year,” Corcoran said, “unless something dramatic happens.” Ronda is a personal finance senior reporter for Yahoo Money and attorney with experience in law, insurance, education, and government.
