3/4/2022,"To pick this precise moment to give Gavin Williamson a knighthood reveals much about Boris Johnson. Why doesn’t the prime minister just give Gavin a gas field, or a bank, and make him honorary president of British Fencing? No 10 probably felt yesterday was a good day to bury bad news. Instead, there was plenty of fury at the revelation that yet another useless person has been deemed sufficiently useful to Johnson to receive an honour. Sir Gavin joins Lord Lebedev and far too many others. Say hello to the wallygarchy. Given the ever more horrifying events in Ukraine, this local reward for failure can obviously be regarded as a trifle. On the one hand, it doesn’t exactly matter if Gavin Williamson is made a knight of some corner of an irradiated Europe. On the other, it’s telling that exactly at the moment the occupants of Downing Street are trying to reach for moral stature, they remind you just how small they really are. One major lesson of the horrors of the past eight days is that we are in a new era. That new era, for those of us with the immeasurable luxury of not being bombed into it, should involve a taking of stock and a moral reset. Values, standards and principles in liberal democracies matter. Some of ours have been allowed to become rather tattered. For instance, we can and must agree that public service is not merely the gateway to cronyism. We can and must agree that political parties being funded by people whose sources of wealth are shadowy is a dangerous and compromising situation that needs urgent remedy. We can and must consider what it means that we have allowed London to become the global capital of choice for laundering the illicit wealth foreign nationals have siphoned out of their own countries. In short, we can and must be better than we have been in many ways, and fast. Yet knighting Gavin Williamson in the middle of all this suggests we have a way to go. I’m sure some galaxy brain will be on to explain how I’m oversimplifying things, but it does feel like it should have been so much simpler to NOT knight Gavin Williamson. How hard can NOT honouring the worst secretary of state in recent memory really be? It is suspiciously unclear what the man sacked as both defence and education secretary is being honoured for. Services to making Russia go away and shut up? Leaking from a top-level National Security Council meeting and consequently undermining the trust of the intelligence services (denied)? Presiding over an epochal failure of British children, from which significant numbers will never recover educationally or in terms of life chances? Obviously, we know that the Johnson administration never particularly cared about the schoolchildren – Williamson was kept in post despite his catastrophic failings during the first lockdown and the exams fiasco that inevitably unfolded that summer. In the end, everything about the government’s approach to an entire generation of children can be summarised by the fact that they reopened the pubs before they reopened all the schools. Yet Gavin could find focus when he wanted to. When Christian Wakeford crossed the floor to join Labour earlier this year, the Bury South MP claimed that Williamson had threatened to cancel a new school in his constituency if he did not vote against extending free school meals into the holidays for the poorest children – a conversation Williamson apparently does not remember having. It’s hard to believe a government that knows all this and still honours Williamson will do the right thing in other areas. Will they clean up the oligarchs to whom they have hitherto shown such sublime indifference or active encouragement, or will they just say that’s what they’re going to do? They do, after all, say a lot of things. Take the culture secretary. The last time I saw Nadine Dorries cry at work she was sobbing because Boris Johnson had pulled out of his post-referendum leadership bid. Yet here she was on Thursday, turning on the waterworks at the dispatch box, offering the BBC “heartfelt thanks and admiration” for its reporting. Oh Nadine. NOW you’re a fan, is it? Because just weeks ago you were issuing tinpot threats on your Twitter about the BBC as we’ve known it being over. Weirdly, I don’t see Nadine’s precious Netflix dodging the bombs in a Kyiv basement in order to bring the world the news. (I should say that the Beeb is in Kyiv alongside many exceptional journalists from other UK broadcasters – a reminder that the BBC’s unique funding model has always elevated our whole market. Rivals cannot compete for funding, so have traditionally competed on quality. And if you don’t believe it, go and watch a range of American broadcast news for an evening.) Anyway, amazing that it’s taken actual war in Europe to make the actual culture secretary realise that maybe – just maybe! – the enemy is a station like Russia Today and not the BBC. Like I said, maybe Nadine has realised that. Notwithstanding her tears, I don’t buy it myself. The one thing you can be absolutely sure of is that this government will be trying to cripple the BBC again in a few months, because at that point that particular position will suit them better once again. The Johnson administration doesn’t do immutable principles. They only do expedience. In fact, it’s occasionally hard not to see in Dorries a watered-down version of higher skilled monsters such as Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, who yesterday claimed the BBC was being used to undermine Russia’s internal politics and security. She should speak to Nadine. I keep hearing from her and half the rest of the cabinet that the BBC undermines the UK’s internal politics. I can never remember exactly why – I think it’s something to do with talent salaries or running stories about the government that they don’t like. Either way, the government now seems to be engaged in a number of hasty pivots. If these are genuine, then good. The time for a “let’s not, and say we did” approach has passed. But on the form book, promises to make the British political family completely legitimate are unconvincing. This week the prime minister has managed to knight one of his cronies and not do very much about any of Putin’s.

3/4/2022,"Imagine the world that Jane Austen creates with her writing. The wit. The romance. The cruelty and complex emotions. The dancing. Then make the dancing very silly indeed. Throw in a few robot moves. Add bubbles. Make those bubbles cascade down from the sky. Chuck in some comedy falls, pounding pop music, cheery singalongs and lots of messy business with some ice-cream sauce. You’re just about there (only add more bubbles). This is a joyfully silly take on Persuasion – with just enough sense (and sensibility) to hold the whole thing together. Everything about director and adapter Jeff James’s audacious production, first performed at the Royal Exchange in 2017, has been amped up to the max. The explosive soundtrack from Ben and Max Ringham plays at full throttle, the wacky dancing is practically an extra character in its own right and the comic performances are full of exuberant and eccentric flourishes. Alex Lowde’s set is, quite literally, a jumping off point for the comedy. A rotating platform edged with neon lights doubles up as a dancefloor, a catwalk (complete with a crackers Kim Kardashian cameo), a foamy ocean and, when Anne’s family members get particularly annoying, a handy ledge off which to shove the offending character. The ensemble cast perform with comic panache, but there are grains of truth beneath all the grandstanding. Matilda Bailes is exceptional in her stage debut and doubles as both Anne’s spoilt sister Elizabeth and love rival Louise Musgrove. Bailes expresses herself as much through barmy dancing as with words, but there’s an increasing desperation to these frantic displays that hint, with both characters, at a deep fear of winding up alone. Helen Cripps and Dorian Simpson play sniping married couple, Mary and Charles, who raise a lot of laughs – but also serve as a constant reminder of the very real possibility of an unhappy ending. Sasha Frost’s Anne is thoughtful and compassionate but also stroppy, impulsive and proud. She makes a believable match with Fred Fergus’s diva-ish but ultimately decent Wentworth. Amid all the mayhem there’s still room in this memorable production for messy, grownup, hold-your-heart-and-hope-for-it love.

3/4/2022,"Lenin, a Russian leader as obsessed with history as Vladimir Putin, famously said: “There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.” This has been the latter. The little more than a week since Russian troops invaded Ukraine has indeed shaken the world. Change has been telescoped, national taboos broken, moribund institutions given purpose and the spectre of a nuclear war in Europe has been raised for the first time since the 1980s. Germany has called it Zeitenwende, the Turning Point. It will not just be Ukraine that is being changed for ever by this war. But there is something specific about how war accelerates change through a form of natural selection. In The Deluge, his classic work on how society is changed by war, the British historian Arthur Marwick wrote: “War acts as a supreme challenge to, and test of, a country’s social and political institutions. War results not only in the destruction of inefficient institutions (such as the Tsarist regime in Russia), but also in the transformation of less efficient mechanisms into more efficient ones”. The west has surprised itself with its ability to respond to the misery inflicted on the people of Ukraine. All kinds of unimaginable images emerge. The German Bundestag cheered an extra €100bn (£82.4bn) on defence spending, followed by 100,000 people on the streets in protest at Putin. Matteo Salvini, the great Italian defender of Putin, bringing white tulips to the Ukrainian embassy. Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, attending a meeting of the EU foreign affairs ministers meeting. The Hungarian leader, Viktor Orban, sharply criticised by human-rights groups and others over the years for his hardline border policies, sitting on a school bench opening his arms to refugees. It was just a fortnight ago that the German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock had appeared at the Munich security conference to caution the crisis was not the moment to try to execute an 180 degree turn on the decades old German policy banning the sale of arms into conflict zones. Josep Borrell, the EU external affairs chief, batted away calls for Ukraine to join the EU, saying they already had an exceptional trade deal. He spoke about the “power of the EU’s language”, distancing himself from his own one time claim that the EU must learn “the language of power”. The next day – Sunday – all the talk was of Emmanuel Macron’s diplomatic initiative, and the concessions the French president had extracted from Vladimir Putin. Even on Wednesday, on the eve of the invasion, Baerbock gave an interview saying it was impossible for Germany to impose the strongest sanctions because of “the massive collateral damage” to Germany’s own economy. Putin could end up laughing at us, she warned. Yet by the following weekend, two days after the invasion began on Thursday, Germany’s coalition government had started that 180 degree course correction. Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his cabinet agreed to send Ukraine with 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 anti-aircraft Stinger missiles, so lifting restrictions on German weapons being sent to conflict zones by third parties. The next day Scholz told the Bundestag in his trademark matter-of-fact manner that he was injecting €100bn into German defence, but protecting other budgets, and defence spending would rise above 2% of German GDP. The MPs from government and the CDU gasped and cheered in equal measure. David McAllister, a leading figure in the German CDU and chair of the European parliament’s foreign affairs select committee, admits he nearly fell off his chair when he heard the plans. The promised growth catapults Germany into becoming the third largest spender on defence globally, behind only the US and China. GlobalData forecasts an annual German defence budget of $83.5 billion in 2024, equating to a 45% increase on 2021’s budget of $57.5bn. That is bigger than France and the UK. Overnight Germany became not just an economic but also a geopolitical powerhouse. Polls said 78% of Germans backed the decision. Matthias Matthijs, Europe senior fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations, said: “It is quite astonishing how fast this government broke pretty well every taboo in postwar German foreign policy.” He attributes the scale of the change to a visit to Berlin on Sunday by the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. “I came to Berlin to shake the conscience of Germany,” Morawiecki said. Sophia Besch, from the Centre for European Reform, points out Scholz himself insisted he had not acted due to pressure from allies, but due to Germany changing its view of the threat posed by Putin. “The truth is the world did not change last Thursday,” she said. “Berlin for years has ignored the warnings that came from many of our allies and from Putin. We need to learn the lessons of how this could have happened and how we could have been so blind. We are leaving behind some of our old beliefs – that economic interdependence prevents conflict, but I am not sure we know yet with what we are replacing this belief.” Sergey Lagodinsky, a German Green MEP, argued Germany now needs not just to spend more money, but to shift its mindset without becoming militaristic or interventionist. It needs to discuss how to adopt escalation, including military escalation, as leverage as part of its foreign policy toolbox. Foreign policy is not just a peace policy, Friedenspolitik in German, but also the ability to deal, manage and face conflict. But the new German coalition, faced by the need to extricate itself from Russian energy, may have to challenge other orthodoxies. The Green economics minister, Robert Habeck, does not rule out extending the use of coal-fired power plants. “This blind, naive, one-sided relationship of dependency on Russia for energy for decades is one of the biggest strategic mistakes of the past 20 years,” Lagodinsky said. “Now we are stuck. It represents a medium- and long-term problem”. But Putin’s recklessness is not just causing a revolution in Germany, but across Europe. Sweden abandoned its policy of not sending weapons to conflict zones, agreeing to send Bofors AT-4, a single-use anti-tank launcher, to Ukraine, plus medical supplies. In Finland a bombshell poll showed 53% want Finland to join Nato. “This poll flipped everything on its head,” said Charly Salonius-Pasternak of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. Moreover the poll showed that if voters were told that politicians said they backed the plan the support went up to 2/3rds. “You could sense the president, Sauli Niinisto, realised the whole defence dynamic was changed.” Niinisto, seen as one of the best readers of what Putin is thinking is now rushing to hold urgent talks with Joe Biden in the White House. Even in Switzerland leaders had to catch up with the public mood in the space of a weekend, and by the Monday an emergency cabinet promised to implement the entire EU sanctions package. The decision does not formally end a policy of neutrality that has survived two world wars, but there is now pressure to track down the many oligarchs that live in the country. There are also calls for an increase in the defence budget There has been a mini-revolution in Italy too where the prime minister, Mario Draghi, accused last week of seeking sanctions carve-outs to protect Italy’s dependence on Russian gas, has also found some mettle. He told parliament on Tuesday: “Yes, we want peace, but it is obvious that whoever amassed more than 60km of tanks near Kiev does not want peace. We cannot turn our backs on Ukraine. Italy does not intend to look away.” He proposed an international public register of those with assets of more than €10m. In France, Macron looks likely to be re-elected comfortably next month as the rightwing candidates find themselves compromised by links to Putin they cannot deny. Eastern European countries, sometimes hostile to refugees, have instead had the most open arms. Poland has taken an unprecedented 600,000 people. Orban the Hungarian leader photographed smiling at child refugees, vows “No one will be left uncared for.” The UK too has been experiencing unusually heavy traffic on the Road to Damascus. The Conservative government promises there will be no hiding place for oligarchs, publishing the delayed economic crime bill and seemingly unnerving Roman Abramovich into selling his stake in Chelsea football club. The endless denigration of Brussels has stopped. “The quality and intensity of the contacts between the EU and UK has been different to anything since before Brexit,” one EU official said. “We have restored a level of trust”. But it has been at the level of the European Union that the action has been quickest and most surprising, revealing Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the EU Commission and former German defence minister, as a powerful advocate for action. For the EU to release €500m from the European Peace Facility to provide equipment and supplies to the Ukrainian armed forces, including - for the first time – lethal equipment, was a first. EU military staff based in Poland are now coordinating military supplies into Ukraine. The EU as a military player is no longer just the stuff of seminars. Equally the Commission in discussing its EU sanctions package acted with an unparalleled speed, and by consensus among the member states. Some EU sanctions packages take months to be agreed as one country or other exploiting the requirement for unanimity uses their veto power to pursue a national interest. That the UK, US and EU were able to coordinate an attack on the Russian central bank, freezing out of some Russian banks from the global Swift bank payment system and implementing measures to prevent Russian banks and firms raising capital showed a wholly unexpected level of resolve. This was a financial declaration of war – an attempt to turn Russia into a pariah economy – something never tried before, using methods never deployed before. It involved, for instance, some G20 central banks freezing the Russian central bank reserves held in their own jurisdiction, so depleting the war chest of reserves that Putin had accumulated to defend his economy if it came under western attack. All this is remarkable, indeed epoch making, but not a cause of celebration. The institutions of liberal democracy may have belatedly shown resolve and unity, but in the here and now they are still losing. Keir Giles from Chatham House thinktank is blunt. “Russia will want to present Zelenskiy with an appalling choice – whether to fight on at immense human cost and to the destruction of his country, infrastructure and economy or to submit to his terms in order that life can go on. “The decision to abandon Ukraine to that fate was made by the west when it gave the green light to Putin by reassuring him that no one would intervene. Nato does not have a strategy to win the war in Ukraine because Nato does not want to be in the war in Ukraine.” European politicians will also be worrying as the price of bread and energy soars in the months ahead whether voters are willing to make the sacrifice. The Lithuanian foreign minister told the UK foreign affairs select committee that half measures would not do. “Putin has no boundaries to what instruments he is going to use and unleash against the Ukrainians”, Gabrielius Landsbergis, said, adding the West “had to go all-in”. He wants humanitarian corridors supported by no fly zones. But the UK and the US have firmly rejected this since it would pit Nato pilots against Russian pilots. A Polish plan, backed by Borrell for Nato to provide Ukraine with Nato jets, training and bombs, got shot down in less than a day. The other remaining option is to end the final carve outs in the sanctions regime. “The push is now for carpet sanctions to match the carpet bombing,” said Orysia Lutsevych from the Ukraine Forum, adding the UK, EU and the US are still buying more than €700m of oil, gas and other commodities that is the equivalent of 150 tanks per day that Russian can finance. That could be stopped either through an energy trade embargo, or by reversing the EU decision to let Gazprombank and Sberbank, the vehicles through which Europe pays for Russian oil and gas, stay in the Swift payment system. UK officials briefed on Wednesday they want to abolish the carve out given by the EU. If these two banks are thrown out of Swift that might immobilise Russian oil and gas exports, or lead to unspecified retaliation by Putin. The breadth and range of economic and financial measures taken against Moscow, not to mention growing sporting and cultural isolation, has been a humiliation for Putin, but it is also a risk for the West if the Russian leader sees no answer but total victory. “He is in a corner, but unfortunately with nuclear weapons, says Giles. The west has been transformed in a week, but the question this weekend is if it would be willing, forced by the chaos of events, to go even further. The charge facing the west after a week of war is the one made by George Orwell of Neville Chamberlain in 1938. Like almost everyone at the time, he “neither wanted to pay the price of peace nor that of war”.",News/World news,The week where decades happened: how the west finally woke up to Putin,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russia-ukraine-how-the-west-woke-up-to-vladimir-putin
3/4/2022,"The attack of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe’s largest – has triggered international concern about the safety of Ukraine’s facilities. Ukraine is heavily dependent on nuclear energy – it has four main power plants, with 15 reactors, generating about half the country’s electricity. On Friday, the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the artillery fire could have caused destruction equal to “six Chernobyls”. For now, say experts, the immediate danger from the incident appears to be low, with Russia having as much to lose as anyone. “If there’s going to be a major nuclear incident it’s because something deliberately is being done,” said Tom Scott, professor in materials at the University of Bristol. “Surely nobody is going to be that stupid. It doesn’t benefit anyone. The wind is blowing towards Russia at the moment.” Rafael Mariano Grossi, head of the IAEA UN nuclear watchdog, confirmed on Friday that radiation levels at the site had remained normal, that all safety systems at the plant were unaffected and that the reactors themselves had not been breached. The projectile had hit an administrative building some distance away within the site. Of the six reactors at the site, five are in safety mode, with one unit operating at 60% capacity. Reports from the site suggest that staff have continued to control operations. While Zelenskiy was quick to highlight the potential for a Chernobyl-scale incident, the technology at Zaporizhzhia is also quite different. The Chernobyl reactor used graphite to keep the nuclear reaction under control and the disaster was caused by a graphite fire. The Zaporizhzhia plant – and those at Ukraine’s other main plants, Khmelnitski, Rovno and South Ukraine – has pressurised water reactors, a more modern type that do not involve graphite. So a fire like the one at Chernobyl will not occur. Pressurised water reactors have a steel vessel at their centre, like a giant pressure cooker with 20cm-thick walls. This contains the nuclear fuel and radioactive products from the nuclear reaction and is designed to withstand damage from events such as earthquakes and aeroplane crashes – although not specifically artillery shells. The inner vessel is surrounded by a heavily steel reinforced concrete containment building – Chernobyl did not have this. For a Chernobyl-level event, both the pressure vessel and concrete bioshield would need to be breached and this would probably require intentional targeting with huge explosives. Nevertheless, there is deep concern about any attack aimed at taking control of a facility could still lead to a nuclear incident. Experts are particularly alarmed that an internationally recognised principle – ensuring the physical integrity of civil nuclear plants – has been disregarded. “It’s very clear that this is against the Geneva convention,” said Scott “It is a flagrant breach of international laws and agreements to do this.” Grossi, who says the situation “continues to be extremely tense and challenging”, said on Friday that he had offered to travel to the Chernobyl site to facilitate a negotiation between Ukraine and Russia, with the aim of agreeing a framework to guarantee the safety of nuclear plants during the conflict. A concerning worst-case scenario, Scott said, was damage to the cooling capability at Zaporizhzhia or one of Ukraine’s other facilities. Even after reactors are switched off, they need continual cooling for several weeks in order to remove residual heat from the core. The cooling systems rely on diesel generators, so any damage to these – or if fuel was siphoned off for other purposes – could cause an incident similar to that at Fukushima, where the plant’s power failed after a tsunami. This could result in the reactors overheating and residual water turning into steam, which can melt the fuel inside the reactor and cause the release of radiation into the atmosphere. There is also a concern about spent fuel storage facilities being disturbed. After fuel is taken out of a reactor core, it is put into spent pool ponds for a year or more to physically cool down before being transferred to long-term, more secure storage.",News/World news,How safe are Ukraine’s nuclear power plants amid Russian attacks?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/how-safe-ukraine-nuclear-power-plants-russian-attacks-zaporizhzhia
3/4/2022,"My boyfriend (aged 39) and I (36) have been together for nine months. We live together, have met each other’s family and friends and are generally very committed to each other – but he still hasn’t told me that he loves me. I’ve told him I love him, but nothing comes back. He also says very little about how he feels about me. He says he’s close to saying it, but needs time, and doesn’t want to be disappointed, as in his previous relationships. He feels he’s on a probation period – that if he doesn’t say it within a specific timeframe, I will leave him. I need and want to hear that he loves me, and feel that I’ve been patient. I don’t want to keep investing in a relationship where one day he’ll decide he doesn’t love me and we should break up. When we met, he was newly single after a five-year relationship and things moved fast. We get on well and have a lot in common, but sometimes we struggle with communication. He also has a quick temper. I often have to be the one to compromise. I had a tough childhood: I don’t speak to my birth father any more and I have trust issues. I did a lot of therapy to help me overcome my past, which worked well, and now I live a relatively normal happy life. On the other hand, he had a happy, stable childhood with no significant problems. We are very sensitive and emotionally aware and have good stable jobs to support us. Should I give up this expectation of hearing my boyfriend say “I love you”? I feel for both of you: here is a situation where you’re both justified in how you feel, but as you want different things, it has become a battle of right and wrong, when it’s not that binary. I don’t think you should give up anything that really matters to you, but neither do I think he can be forced into saying something he can’t say at the moment or doesn’t feel. But it’s you who’s written in, and you I’m concerned with. It’s destabilising being on a train whose destination you don’t know. Some people find it exciting but I, like you, need to know where I’m heading. It sounds as if you feel that him saying “I love you” will guarantee things. Unfortunately, it won’t, and I wonder if, even if he says it, it will be enough for you. Is there something else about him that makes you feel anxious? What have you been like in previous relationships? It’s how the relationship makes you feel that matters, more than what someone says. Silva Neves, a sexual and relationship counsellor (cosrt.org.uk) suggested you both look at what’s behind your feelings – could it be anxiety? You could both be feeling the same thing (some common ground!), but expressing it very differently. We were both concerned about his temper. Maybe he’s the sort of person who feels anger is a “better” emotion for a man than vulnerability. “When he loses his temper,” said Neves, “what does that do to you in relation to what your childhood was like? A lot of people find partners with similar traits to their parents, as a way to fix their past. Could your efforts to get your partner to say “I love you”, have something to do with your father?” Ultimately, if your partner doesn’t make you feel safe and loved – in word or deed – you have a right to look for those things elsewhere. But if everything else about this relationship is positive, and the “I love you” is the cherry on the cake, it may be worth waiting for him to catch up.

3/4/2022,"When the subject of tricky foods for wine comes up, it generally focuses on miscreants such as asparagus, artichokes and eggs. But citrus can be even more of a problem. That might surprise you, given that there are quite a few citrussy wines, most notably sauvignon blanc, but if the citrus flavour in a dish is dominant, as it is in spaghetti al limone or chicken tagine with preserved lemon, say, you’re better off with a more neutral dry white or a red, because the lemon in the dish tends to strip out the citrus in the wine. Intensely lemony desserts, such as the classic French tarte au citron, are even more of a challenge, because they need very sweet wines that also match their acidity – late-harvest rieslings such as the Seifried number in today’s pick generally work best. Orange-flavoured desserts or cakes, such as orange polenta cake, can also be problematic. Spanish moscatels generally hit the spot, or try Hungary’s fabulously marmaladey tokaji. (If chocolate is involved, you could always turn to orange-flavoured liqueurs such as Cointreau or Grand Marnier.) Other solutions? So far as puds are concerned, cream or other dairy such as ricotta or cream cheese tends to mitigate the sharpness of lemon and lime. Lemon cheesecake is easier to pair than lemon tart, bringing in wines such as sauternes and similar sweet bordeaux as options. With savoury dishes, too, there are often other ingredients in a dish that will offset the citrus. In Greek lamb dishes that are seasoned with lemon, for example, it’s the lamb - and often the feta – that kicks lemony whites such as assyrtiko into touch. It can also be worth holding back on the lemon with, say, fish and chips, or a zesty salad to which you intend to add a squeeze of lime, and see how the wine tastes without it. A fresh, citrussy white or a limey Clare Valley riesling in the case of the salad could well do the job for you. Finally, bear in mind that the acid in citrus will accentuate the sweetness of any accompanying wine, so if you served a chardonnay, for example, with a lemony dish, it would probably taste richer and more buttery, and an already jammy shiraz even jammier. But that could, of course, be to your taste. Fresco di Masi Bianco 2021 £13.99 golden acre wines, 11%. Fresh, crisp but not overly citrussy, this attractive unfiltered organic white would drink really well with salads and fish dishes. Lion’s Den Assyrtiko 2019 £9.99 Aldi, 13%. Bright, lemony white that would be perfect with grilled lamb with feta and mint. Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Old Vine Garnacha Calatayud 2019, £10. 15%. Garnacha, or grenache as it’s known in France, works brilliantly with rich, orangey stews or duck with orange. Seifried Estate Sweet Agnes Riesling 2019 £16.99 a half-bottle Averys and Laithwaites, £17.49 Waitrose, 10.5%. My usual go-to with a lemon tart. Just luscious. Frappato 2020 Terre Siciliane, 13.5%, £11.99 Averys, Laithwaites, or £9.99 if you buy a case. Deliciously juicy Italian red that could easily take a lemony chicken or pasta dish in its stride.

3/4/2022,"The Rugby Football Union’s decision this week in effect to ringfence the Premiership is disappointing to those fans who value a bit of jeopardy in their sport. By denying Ealing and Doncaster access to the top tier because they cannot hold the requisite 10,000 fans in their stadiums, the game’s governing body has sealed shut the trap door on the floor, creating a scenario where stodgy teams could drift on a breeze of mediocrity. Like the fortuitous bounce of an oval ball, the fixture list has served up a contest that will distract dissenters for the weekend at least. Leicester Tigers, sitting imperiously at the top of the table with 15 wins from 17 games, make the trip south to play Saracens, 16 points behind but with a game in hand. Two dynasties with a combined 15 titles between them have forged their success on powerful packs, a strong maul game and well drilled set pieces and are the standout outfits this campaign. “They’re the best team in the league,” Steve Borthwick, Leicester’s coach who represented Saracens 144 times as a player, captaining them to their first league triumph in 2011, said of his rivals. “Look at the squad they’ve got, the resources they’ve got, how long the team has been together. They’ve got incredible ability.” In Vincent Koch at tighthead they have a World Cup winner. In Mako Vunipola and Sean Maitland they have two British & Irish Lions. Eliot Daly and Billy Vunipola would make many pundits’ best England 15, and Aled Davies and Nick Tompkins are Wales internationals. They are also fresh from a bye and will be desperate to avenge their 13-12 defeat to Leicester in October courtesy of a late penalty try. Leicester’s last appearance in the semi-finals came in 2017. Their last title was back in 2013. This season proves that Borthwick’s project has left base camp with last season’s European Challenge Cup final defeat an important stepping stone. It is still a fresh squad, with nine of the starting 15 having fewer than 40 caps for the club, though they are complimented by a clutch of mainstays that includes Freddie Burns, Harry Wells and George Ford, captaining Leicester in his 119th game for them. The fly-half was released from the England squad by Eddie Jones and he is not the only player who has swapped the red rose for a club badge. Ollie Chessum (Leicester), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Bevan Rodd (Sale Sharks) and Daly at Saracens add star power to their respective teams. Luke Cowan-Dickie will not be among them. The England hooker could miss the rest of the season with a knee injury which is bad news for Exeter Chiefs, chasing a fourth consecutive win and ensconced in a crowded race for a top-four position. Nine points separate Saracens in second and Sale in seventh who would move above Exeter in fourth with a win on Sunday. Gloucester are also in the mix in sixth with a game in hand over the surrounding teams. The Cherry and Whites have nine academy products in the squad for the visit of Northampton Saints including Louis Rees-Zammit off the bench. It is a testament to the competitiveness of the league that 64% of its participants could still feasibly reach the next round. But eyes shrouded by furrowed brows will be on bottom-placed Bath as they host Bristol. Injuries to key players, including Taulupe Faletau, Joe Cokanasiga and Anthony Watson have played a part in their decline, but it is a damning sight when one of the league’s four original members is five points behind thrice-relegated Worcester. Bath will not go down no matter what transpires over the next three months. At least there is jeopardy at the top.",Sport/Sport,Steve Borthwick hails Saracens’ ability before mouthwatering tie ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/04/steve-borthwick-hails-saracens-ability-mouthwatering-tie-rugby-union

3/4/2022,"California has introduced a bill that would allow nurse practitioners to provide abortion care without the supervision of a physician. The San Diego senator Toni Atkins, who introduced the bill, said the expansion of nurses’ roles would address both a looming shortage of healthcare professionals in the state, and help California prepare for a potential influx of patients driven by increasingly stringent abortion laws elsewhere. Atkins said the measure would be especially useful in serving communities of color that suffer most from understaffed healthcare systems. “When nurse practitioners are able to work independently, underserved communities – which are predominantly communities of color – benefit from an increase in access to services,” she added. “​​SB 1375 would create opportunities for more Californians to receive the care they need, regardless of their zip code.” The bill SB 1375 was announced on Wednesday, and would ease restrictions that were set in place by a 2013 law, which allowed nurse practitioners, certified midwives and physician assistants to carry out abortions as long as they were under the supervision of a physician and completed a certain set of requirements in their training. Under the new bill, nurses who obtain a minimum number of hours and clinical experience could perform the procedure unsupervised. Atkins said the goal is to increase the number of healthcare workers in California who can perform abortions ahead of a potential supreme court ruling this summer that could overturn Roe v Wade, allowing states to ban or severely restrict the procedure. “As states like Texas and others start to restrict further abortion, it just makes sense that women are going to find other places to go. California will be one of those states,” she said, indicating that the state will host women from places like Texas where the draconian abortion law has been in effect for six months. Atkins’s measure will probably sit well in a state that has already branded itself “a sanctuary” for patients seeking abortion care while other states clamp down on. In December, the California Future of Abortion Council announced a series of recommendations to consider to prepare for the high influx of prospective patients travelling from out of state that included paying for travel, lodging and access to care. Atkins also cited a potential shortage of healthcare workers in the next decade and highlighted how this bill could address that. According to a 2019 report by the California Future Health Workforce Commission, the state is expecting to see a drop of 4,100 primary care clinicians and 600,000 homecare providers. The scarcity is being driven by a retiring generation of healthcare providers, at a time when health departments are struggling to recruit workers due to “lack of tools for recruiting, limited options for advancement, and instability of funded positions”, the report said. One of the recommendations made in the report to address this shortage is to expand roles of nurse practitioners and to give them “greater practice authority”. “Families who live in clinic deserts found throughout the state have a particularly difficult time accessing primary care, because there simply are not enough providers available to them,” Senator Atkins said. “Nurse practitioners can help fill that growing need.” Patti Gurney, President of the California Association for Nurse Practitioners (CANP), lauded the move and said they are sponsoring the bill. “It is important that restrictions on practice be removed so that patients can receive timely, uninterrupted, and high-quality care in all health settings,” she said.",News/US news,California considers allowing nurses to perform abortions without doctors,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/04/california-abortion-nurse-practitioners-bill
3/4/2022,"International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons gave one of the most political speeches at an Olympics and Paralympics opening ceremony for decades, as he opened the Beijing 2022 Winter Paralympics saying: “I want – I must – begin with a message of peace as the leader of our organisation. I am horrified at what is taking place in the world right now. The 21st century is a time for dialogue and diplomacy, not war and hate.” Throwing away decades of tradition of only making guarded comments at such events, Parsons continued: “The Olympic Truce for peace during the Olympic and Paralympic Games is a UN resolution. It must be respected and observed, not violated. At the IPC we aspire to a better and more inclusive growth, free from discrimination, free from hate, free from ignorance, and free from conflict.” He finished his speech by almost bellowing the word “Peace”. In 2014 in Sochi, the Ukrainian Winter Paralympics team had staged a symbolic protest, sending only one athlete to the opening ceremony to represent them as Russian troops invaded the Crimean peninsula. Eight years later, with their country again under attack from Russia, the scene was very different. Maksym Yarovyi carried in his nation’s flag ahead of a full delegation, whose arrival in China had been fraught, while the Russian delegation announced that they would be leaving China rather than filing an immediate legal appeal over their expulsion. Head of the Ukrainian delegation, Valerii Sushkevych, told a news conference on the eve of the Games: “It’s a miracle that we have made it to the Paralympics. We overcame a lot of barriers on the way.” He himself slept on the floor of a bus during the last two days of their journey through Europe. With the ban on athletes from Russia and Belarus, 46 nations paraded in Beijing’s “Bird’s Nest” stadium, as the city became the first to host both the summer and winter editions of the Paralympics. “Let’s work together for a shared and brighter future,” said Cai Qi, the president of the Beijing organising committee. Athletes from Azerbaijan, Israel and Puerto Rico represented countries making their Winter Paralympics debut in a Games held not just under the shadow of war in Ukraine, but widely criticised for the decision to hold them in China at all, given the human rights record of the host nation. The Games run until Sunday 13 March, when the closing ceremony will take place in the same venue. Covid restrictions meant the crowd was limited, but there was no need to use the cardboard cut-outs of people employed at the Winter Olympics opening ceremony to boost the apparent numbers there. Chinese president Xi Jinping attended and formally declared the Games open. Sochi bronze-medal winner Gregor Ewan and Paralympic debutant Meggan Dawson-Farrell were flag-bearers for the British Winter Paralympics team, which is sending its largest delegation of athletes – 25 in total – since Lillehammer in 1994. Ewan and Dawson-Farrell are part of the wheelchair curling team who will face Norway and then the United States in their opening matches on Saturday. British athletes will compete in five of the six sports at these Games: Alpine skiing, biathlon, cross-country skiing, snowboarding as well as the wheelchair curling. Only the para ice hockey contest will not feature British representation. Medal hopes Millie Knight and Menna Fitzpatrick were absent from the parade, preparing for their Alpine Skiing races which start from 10am in Beijing (2am UK time) on Saturday morning. Meanwhile, the Russian Paralympic Committee (RPC) confirmed its delegation would be leaving China. In a statement the RPC said they reserved “the right to apply to the appropriate international and national court” later, but that it was not “worthwhile at the current time to remain in Beijing.” They also singled out International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach for criticism, saying his call for Russian and Belarussian teams to be expelled from international events lead “to the degradation and collapse of the world sport.” Bach was absent from the opening ceremony, having tested positive for Covid-19 in the build-up. The RPC delegation are expected to depart China on Sunday.
