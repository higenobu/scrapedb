2/28/2022,"Belarus may be preparing to send its soldiers into Ukraine in support of the Russian invasion, perhaps as soon as this week, according to a US defence official, amid mounting concern about Minsk’s military preparations. Belarus has already been used as a staging post by Russian forces, who gathered there on the pretext of joint military exercises before last week’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Now there is increasing evidence that Minsk may be moving towards becoming an explicit participant in the war. On Monday it announced it was revoking its non-nuclear status after a referendum, allowing Russian weapons to be placed in Belarus. The move provoked rare protests in the country. Last week the EU’s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, said the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, was allowing his country to become a Russian satellite state, and on Sunday night the US official said: “It’s very clear Minsk is now an extension of the Kremlin.” Russian and Ukrainian delegations were due to hold talks about the conflict in southern Belarus, near the Ukrainian border, on Monday. The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office said on the Telegram app that his delegation had arrived, including the defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, a close adviser to the president and the deputy foreign minister. “The key issue of the negotiations is an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of troops from the territory of Ukraine,” Zelenskiy’s office said. Images have emerged in recent days of trains loaded with tanks reportedly arriving in the city of Brest, in south-west Belarus, and there have been reports of missile and aircraft launches from within Belarus. On Sunday Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian internal affairs minister, said Iskander missiles had been launched from Belarus towards Ukraine. “The launch of Iskanders across Ukraine from Mozyr region. Launch around 1700,” Gerashchenko wrote on Telegram. He posted a video showing a missile being fired reportedly towards the Rivne region bordering Belarus. Zelenskiy appealed to Belarus on Sunday to stay out of Russia’s war. “In the war that is going on now, you are not on the same side with us,” he said in a recorded message. “From your territory, the troops of the Russian Federation launch rockets into Ukraine. “Our children are being killed from your territory, our houses are being destroyed, they are trying to blow up everything that has been built over decades – and, by the way, not only by us, but also by our fathers, our grandfathers. “And all this is also a de facto referendum for you, Belarusians. You decide who you are. You decide who to be. How will you look into the eyes of your children, how will you look into the eyes of each other, your neighbours. We are your neighbours. We are Ukrainians. Be Belarus, not Russia. You are making this choice right today.” About 800 people were arrested as Belarus voted to ditch its non-nuclear status. The vote sparked the biggest protests in months as thousands took to the streets. Lukashenko has imposed a sweeping crackdown on dissent after a contested election challenged his grip on power in 2020. The vote to change the constitution, passed by 65%, according to official data, could lead to the return of nuclear weapons to Belarusian territory for the first time since the country gave them up after the fall of the Soviet Union. On Sunday, speaking at a polling station, Lukashenko said he could ask Russia to return nuclear weapons to Belarus. “If you [the west] transfer nuclear weapons to Poland or Lithuania, to our borders, then I will turn to Putin to return the nuclear weapons that I gave away without any conditions,” Lukashenko said.",News/World news,"Belarus may be about to send its troops into Ukraine, US official says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/belarus-troops-ukraine-russia-invasion
2/28/2022,"Rail fares will rise across England and Wales by an average of 3.8% on Tuesday, the same day that a city-wide tube strike begins in London. The fare rise, set by last July’s RPI inflation figure, will pile hundreds of pounds to some passengers’ annual travel costs, adding to the wider cost of living crisis. Campaigners said the increase would harm efforts to attract people back to public transport and to reinvigorate city centre economies after the pandemic. Fares will rise by an average 4.8% in London – 1% above RPI – as a condition of the emergency funding settlements agreed between central government and Transport for London. Passengers will struggle to travel in the capital over the next three or four days, with two 24-hour strikes on the London underground to be held on Tuesday and Thursday over fears for jobs, pensions and working conditions. TfL has told commuters to expect severe disruption across all services, with most tube trains stopped entirely on both strike days and the effects of the walkout likely to be felt on the Wednesday and Friday mornings. Other trains are likely to be busier and buses slowed by ensuing congestion on the roads. TfL advised Londoners who rely on tube connections to work from home if possible, or for essential travel to consider walking, cycling or using rental e-scooters, and to allow extra time for their journeys. Last-minute talks on Monday were held between TfL and the RMT union but sources said there was little expectation of a breakthrough after negotiations at Acas stalled last week. Fare rises coming into effect on Tuesday will add between 10p and 30p to most single fares on buses and tubes, and raise price caps on travel in the capital. A slightly lower 3.8% average rise on train fares will be introduced across railways in England and Wales, matching the increase in Scotland in late January. Campaigners have criticised the move as counterproductive. Bruce Williamson of the campaign group Railfuture said the government was “stoking the fire of the cost of living crisis” and said that it was time to stop linking rail fares to the RPI inflation index. “Inflation this year is likely to hit 8%, so unless the government changes the formula, the average rail traveller will be bankrupted next year,” he said. The Campaign for Better Transport calculated that the average full-time worker commuting from Brighton into London would have to work for seven weeks just to pay for their annual rail season ticket. It will now cost almost £200 more, at £5,302; a Liverpool to Manchester season ticket will rise by £105 to 2,865. The campaign’s chief executive, Paul Tuohy, said: “This fare rise couldn’t come at a worst time and will simply add to the cost-of-living crisis. We need to get people back into workplaces, eating in town centre cafes and shopping on their lunch breaks to help kickstart the economy.” Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association, said: “Jacking up rail fares as we begin the journey out of a pandemic is a staggeringly stupid move by this Tory government. It’s almost as though ministers want to force people off our railways and into cars in an effort to speed up our climate crisis.” The Rail Delivery Group, which represents the industry, said: “The government’s decision to hold fares down below current inflation is positive. It is important that fares are set at a level that will encourage more people to travel by train in the future, helping to support a clean and fair recovery from the pandemic.”",Lifestyle/Money,Train fares to rise by 3.8% in England and Wales as London tube strike begins,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/28/train-fares-rise-england-wales-london-tube-strike-rail
2/28/2022,"“If you want to have a chat and a cup of tea, you can, if you want to put your hands in the dirt you can,” says Denise Farrell, site manager at the Wolves Lane Centre, a community garden of glasshouses and planting beds set within the suburbs of Wood Green, north London. Over the past decade, community gardens have started to occupy a similar place in the nation’s psyche as the allotment, with the number of plots increasing nationwide. While the latter can offer quiet sanctuary, gardens like Wolves Lane focus on the collective endeavour and have helped bring a “dig for victory” spirit back to gardening and localism. The RHS introduced community garden awards last year. Like many similar sites, Wolves Lane was an area of underused public land. In 2017, Haringey council, which for decades had used the site to grow the borough’s ornamental flowers – think memorial gardens and roundabouts – transferred its three acres to the local community. “We pay a small amount of rent, we weren’t given any money to run it,” Yvonne Field, founder of the The Ubele Initiative, says. Ubele, a local Black social enterprise, is one of three organisations that secured the site, alongside Organiclea, a growers’ cooperative, and Cropdrop, a veg box delivery scheme. Gardens like this have played an important role in food security, feeding parts of the country where hunger is a stark reality. Wolves Lane, Farrell later points out, provides 400 meals a week to people living in food poverty. Besides this vital service, the centre is keen to focus on education and experimentation and the nine glasshouses and outdoor beds are split between a range of growers, including a local flower company, a cacti gardener and Black-led growing initiative Black Rootz. Grower Norbert tends the “hot beds” in one of Black Rootz’ glasshouses, a space that holds plants from the Caribbean and the global south. Norbert, originally from Guadeloupe, points to photos of last year’s aubergine and callaloo crop, while standing beside towering tobacco plants. “We don’t use pesticides or chemicals, everything is natural.” By the gates, a noticeboard shows a bird’s-eye vision of the site’s future. Led by architect firm Practice Architecture and Studio Gil, with the builders due to arrive next month, the £1.9m project will deliver a community hall, classrooms and workshops. Farrell points to the location of a new orchard and the prospect of apple juice and wassailing. Part-funded by the Greater London Authority and National Lottery, the development marks a significant achievement for those running the garden. “It’s like a little laboratory … I feel really lucky. Things keep happening.” she says.Krish Nathaniel To find out how to create a community garden, contact the charity Social Farms & Gardens. The RHS has tips and information. Groundwork is another great resource, with advice about funding. You don’t need a forest to start a forest garden. Also known as a food-forest, or an agroforest, it’s an approach to gardening that imitates the structure of a natural forest and you can apply its principles to a space as small as your balcony or backyard. In essence, it’s a system for growing where multiple layers of trees, shrubs and ground plants work together in an integrated and self-sustaining way. Currants can grow in the shade of an apple tree and wild strawberries might be seeded as a ground layer establishing a diverse and interactive ecosystem, where a traditional orchard would rely only on apple trees and grass. This biodiversity in turn regenerates the soil and creates resilience in the face of disturbances, such as climate change, as does the system’s preference for perennials over annuals, which also calls for less digging (emitting less carbon), less maintenance (hurray!) and less reliance on pesticides or fertilisers as the interaction between these diverse layers and species moves the garden towards an equilibrium of its own. Brought to the UK, after a spell in the tropics, by Robert Hart in the 1970s, his book Forest Gardening (1996), reflecting on decades of cultivation of an eighth of an acre in Shropshire’s Wenlock Edge. It serves as an accessible introduction to agroforestry, as does Patrick Whitefield’s How To Make A Forest Garden (2002). For more developed insights, Martin Crawford’s Creating a Forest Garden (2010) is essential reading. The Forest Gardening Design Course that Crawford, through his charity, the Agroforestry Research Trust, runs from his bountiful plot in south Devon is, by now, a rite of passage for budding agro-foresters from all over the world.Ashish Ghadiali Two decades ago, Isabella Tree and her husband, Charlie Burrell, started rewilding a “polluted piece of land” depleted by decades of intensive farming on the Knepp Castle estate in West Sussex. Now Knepp is one of the biggest biodiversity hotspots in the UK and a touchstone for the rewilding movement worldwide. Rewilding aims to restore natural ecosystems by allowing wildlife to reclaim land and it’s urgently needed, says Tree, who wrote about her experiments at Knepp in the book Wilding (2018). “We need to restore our soils and wetlands; sequester carbon to prevent floods. Having rewilded areas around cities can act as the lungs to filter and clean the air. And threading them through productive agricultural land will actually increase yields.” This may work beautifully at a 3,500-acre estate such as Knepp, but what about a modest back garden? Is rewilding possible there, too? “Absolutely,” says Tree. “The first thing is to go chemical-free, cut out herbicides and pesticides.” If you can’t do without a lawn, she advises not mowing in May, to boost biodiversity, or planting “a scented, mossy chamomile lawn” instead of grass. Rewilding her own walled garden at Knepp recently, Tree created “lumps and bumps and hollows” to provide more surface area and greater diversity of terrain. “Once the plants establish, then we’ll take our hands off the steering wheel a bit, and see what actually wants to be there and what doesn’t. Hopefully, by then, we’ll have masses of diversity. And, in miniature, we’ll have the same kind of mosaic of habitats that we have in the wider landscape. And that will be a bonanza for wildlife, for insects and birds.”Killian Fox  Knepp is running “rewild your garden” safaris Creating a spiritual garden is about understanding the spirit of the earth beneath our feet and how our patch relates to the wider, natural world. In the process, the garden becomes a place of sanctuary, contemplation, and meditation, rather than somewhere just to grow veg or put a trampoline. Nature becomes the guiding principle, whether it’s by using geometrical shapes and patterns found in nature (circles, spirals, hexagons) to design the garden, creating a wildlife-friendly area, or working with the five elements (earth, air, water, spirit, fire) and introducing firepits, pools or a compost heap. It can be as simple as placing a bench in a particular spot to sit and be still, or as involved as dowsing energy lines to find the best position for a stone labyrinth (used as a meditation tool). Sacred gardens have historical precedents, including Moorish paradise gardens, which were inspired by the teachings of the Koran and have four square compartments and a central fountain, and Japanese Zen Buddhist gardens with their “stroll” paths of paving stones set amid gravel to slow the pace and encourage walking meditation. Thinking of a garden as a spiritual space makes you look at it differently. You begin to regard yourself as a “guardian” of the earth, rather than a “gardener”. This is the ethos driving the work of Irish garden designer and environmental campaigner Mary Reynolds. She suggests that by understanding the spirit of a place, we restore and replenish the earth and ourselves. This can be as simple as leaving things alone – allowing the land to heal and wildlife return. But sometimes bringing change reawakens the magic present in even the smallest garden plot.Clare Gogerty Modern medicine evolved from the carefully tended soil of physic gardens. These were cultivated across Europe from the 16th century on to teach apprentice apothecaries how to identify and grow plants with healing properties. According to Nell Jones, head of plant collections at London’s Chelsea Physic Garden, they were essentially “a training ground for the precursors to modern day doctors and pharmacists”. The first such garden in the UK was developed more than 400 years ago and is now known as The University of Oxford Botanic Garden. (In the 19th century, the focus shifted to the science of botany and plant classification.) Professor Simon Hiscock, director of the Oxford Botanic Garden, explains their relevance today: “Early physic gardens like Oxford are important centres of research and teaching in the plant sciences, as well as being critical for plant conservation and communicating how important plants are for daily life and the sustainable future of our planet. Botanic gardens are also places where people can engage with plants and nature for their mental health and wellbeing, reflecting their original medical roots.” In London, the Chelsea Physic Garden was set up in 1673 by the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries. It’s a serene, four-acre plot strategically positioned near the river. From here, the apothecaries could vet new plants entering the country via the Thames. “Over the years, the garden became one of the most important centres for plant knowledge,” explains Jones, the head of plant collections. “It started out helping to develop and standardise medicine in this country, and evolved to help people understand how to grow plants in the best possible way.” According to Jones, physic gardens are much more than a “tranquil, ecological space” to while away an afternoon – they are reminders of the “medicinal, economic, cultural and environmental importance of plants to the survival and well-being of humankind.” The award-winning landscape architect and horticulturalist, Marian Boswall, has written about the benefits of planting your own modern apothecary garden. “We know that a little gardening is good for us, so why not combine this with what we grow in a health-giving garden?” She reasons. Boswall suggests looking to see what already grows in abundance in your garden: “For example, today, I found lots of violets which I had not noticed all winter, so I put some in tea.” If you’re short of space, don’t underestimate the presence of a pot of basil beside your kitchen sink. “Basil is meant to be good for the brain, so I used to feed it to my children around exam time. I try to inhale mine deeply when trying to think through something,” she says. Boswall, whose forthcoming book, Sustainable Garden (Francis Lincoln), features projects and advice for the eco-conscious gardener, says. “If you have a sunny window box then lavender is loved by pollinators, gives off a calming scent, you can put it under your pillow to help you sleep, and place it in drawers to help prevent moths eating your best jumpers.” For those with outdoor space, Boswall suggests calendula. “The petals look beautiful in salads or frozen into ice cubes and are said to have healing properties when used in an infusion … I also keep digestive-aid mint in pots and allow comfrey to creep under the hedge for tea.“But remember, some healing herbs can be powerful medicines and even poisons, so always read up on how to use them before applying them to your skin or eating them.”Nell Card Dig your soil and you’re causing active damage to a complex ecosystem. “You kill centipedes, millipedes, spiders” and other tiny creatures, says Charles Dowding, the UK’s best-known advocate for no-dig gardening. “You’re also breaking the mycelial threads that make up the fungal networks – that’s a key mechanism for how plants feed.” That’s one reason why Dowding hasn’t had to use feeds or fertilisers in four decades on his Somerset farm: “We’re leaving the feeding network intact.” Nor does he use slug pellets, because his healthy soil contains ground beetles that eat slug eggs. Dowding has been experimenting with no-dig since the early 1980s. He says the strategy has two tenets: “Leaving soil undisturbed, and applying a mulch on the surface of organic matter to feed the organisms in the soil.” These organisms then “build structure and keep the air in the soil, and that means good drainage”. If you want to give the method a go, the first step is to get rid of weeds. “Light deprivation is the key principle,” says Dowding. “If you can keep the light off [a weed] for long enough, it will die.” Reckon on as little as one month for lawn grass or chickweed, or as much as three years for bindweed. Dowding suggests a layer of cardboard put directly on to the weeds and an inch or two of compost on top. You don’t need to wait for the weeds to die: you can plant into the compost straightaway and the cardboard will eventually decompose. “In seven to eight weeks, plants will be rooting through it.” It’s not for everyone, as Dowding explains: “Sometimes people will say to me, ‘I don’t like no-dig, I enjoy digging.’ And I say, ‘Well, your soil won’t and your plants won’t either.’” He laughs. “They haven’t considered that.”Killian Fox",Lifestyle/Life and style,A growing revolution: new ways of using the land,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/28/a-growing-revolution-new-ways-of-using-the-land
2/28/2022,"Fifteen miles to the south-east of Denali, the highest peak in North America, lies a colossal mountain range that rears from the ground like a vertiginous jaw. Fittingly, the various summits of this natural wonder are called Moose’s Tooth, Eye Tooth, Sugar Tooth and Broken Tooth. While many explorers have conquered each of these peaks, none have attempted a lateral climb from summit to summit,akin to walking atop the skyline. But a black-and-white aerial photograph of the forbidding path, all snow-capped and wrapped in billowy clouds, beckons the adventurous spirit of mountaineers Renan Ozturk, Freddie Wilkinson and Zach Smith. Directed by Ozturk and Wilkinson, this awe-inspiring documentary is as much about their years-long attempts to scale the Tooth traverse as it is about Brad Washburn, the man behind the image that ignited their curiosity. A daring figure with an inexhaustible passion for exploration, Washburn pioneered the use of aerial photography in cartography, crafting superbly detailed maps of regions previously neglected by geographers. The extraordinary milestones of Washburn’s career – including his tenure as the director of the Boston Museum of Science – are interwoven with the highs and lows in the three climbers’ private lives. Despite the deaths of fellow mountaineers, neck-breaking accidents and financial struggles, their determination to scale the traverse is staggering in its unshakeable resilience. And amid perilous risks of avalanche and falling rocks, their enthusiasm has a childlike wonder that feels especially moving. While the juxtaposition of different timelines results in occasional clunkiness, the breathtaking cinematography more than makes up for the uneven telling. In the face of global climate change, these images of the glacial otherworldliness of Alaska carry a wistful splendour and a bittersweet urgency.

2/28/2022,"Every two months since March 2020, I have declared the pandemic over. “Grow up, Covid’s over now,” I say to no one in particular. The pronouncement comes more in hope than expectation; the truth is, I’m miserable and desperate for all this to end. The only lingering concern is that the bright 22-year-old I was two years ago is gone for ever; and, like masks on the tube and vaccine scepticism, the perpetually tracksuited homebody I’ve become is the new normal. I’m not alone in feeling I’ve lost my groove. According to a study by the Prince’s Trust, happiness and confidence among 16- to 25-year-olds has slumped to a 13-year low. It goes without saying that Covid is a significant cause of the malaise. Most of the house parties, let alone nightclubs, festivals and holidays, have been cancelled, often before they were organised in the first place. Not only does this mean more time spent alone, staring blankly at the screen that seems to be permanently 20cm from my nose, it also means nothing to look forward to: no reward for all the effort I put into college, university and trying to get a job. Where once the end of exams meant parties and trips abroad with friends, it is now marked with depressing Zoom drinks – if indeed it is at all. For those young people of school age, disruption to education is now beyond repair. According to a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, today’s children in the UK face losing £350bn in lifetime earnings as a result of the deskilling and widening inequalities that losing so much time at school cost them. For those at university, the profound unfairness of having your place there dictated by algorithm, only to arrive and spend your freshers’ week confined to grotty, overcrowded accommodation would surely do it. Covid disruption, to both teaching and students’ social lives, has created a sense that the current generation has been denied the full experience. The news that students in England will now be expected to pay back loans over 40 years instead of 30 means there is a very real question over whether university is even worth it any more. The years aged 21 to 25 are traditionally defined by the excitement of taking our first steps into professional life in our first “proper” jobs. Today’s young people may never have met their colleagues and, with hybrid working here to stay, there’s a decent likelihood they never will. What were once the prime years to go out, get drunk, sleep around and make lasting friendships with colleagues have instead been defined by a grim sense that maybe life will never return to normal. Social media is full of people posting messages such as: “My birthday this year doesn’t count. As far as I’m concerned, I’m still 22.” It’s a cry for help, a begrudging acceptance that some of the best years of our lives have been lost to the virus. While I’m optimistic that my groove can be salvaged, deep down I fear that Covid is the least of the problems facing my generation. A decade of low growth and stagnant wages means an ever greater chunk of our pay is required to keep a roof over our heads. For all that young people are publicly urged to cut out flat whites and Netflix subscriptions if we want to get on the property ladder, our inability to buy houses is rarely due to a lack of will. In my experience, young people are totally obsessed with homeownership, in part because the distant fantasy is so obviously more attractive than the alternative – decades of perpetual housesharing, all the while paying far more in rent than you ever would in mortgage payments. In response, young people are increasingly atomised, often retreating into cohabiting couples or staying at home with parents to desperately try to save money. It is hardly surprising that I hear about so many friendship groups withering. In my case, without the social events and dynamics that formed the basis of some of my most important relationships, the joy I once found in them has faded. With so much distance between us all, we have forgotten the ties that bind us. Still, I am one of the lucky ones. The alienating impact of the pandemic is far worse for those not in work, education or training, particularly those who lack the family support – emotional as well as financial – to continue socialising when between jobs. Of young people in those groups, about 25% report always feeling anxious, compared with 15% among those in work or study. Being young has never been more expensive or emotionally exhausting. The Prince’s Trust report found 40% of young people say they are anxious about socialising with people, one-third say they don’t know how to make new friends and 35% say they’ve never felt more alone. Just last weekend, I was talking to one of my friends about how quaint and 1990s the TV show Friends seems now: not because of the fashion or questionable politics, but because of the idea that your friends might be an effective substitute for your family through your 20s. Today’s young people simply can’t afford to waste their time or money hanging out at Central Perk. In effect, Friends’ enduring appeal (it is still one of the most consistently watched shows on Netflix) is that it makes people nostalgic for a time when being young seemed a lot more fun. They say youth is wasted on the young but clearly, being young isn’t what it used to be. My hope for the long term is that our expectations adjust. Perhaps the pandemic has engendered a greater understanding of the unbearable pressure many young people are under, not least from themselves. And when pubs and restaurants were closed I know many discovered new talents and hobbies that will continue to bring them joy long after their clubbing days would have ended. I’m ending the pandemic in an optimistic mood. I may have lost two of “the best years of my life”, but I’m sure there will be plenty of opportunities to make new memories and salvage my best self in the process. After all, time is on my side.

2/28/2022,"Most Wordle players have a sense of what might and what might not be a “Wordle kind of word”, especially when some given day’s answer isn’t one. The thinking behind the word list is not a secret. Josh Wardle wrote the game to make his partner Palak Shah happy; her price of admission was to take a long longlist of 12,000 five-letter words and pare it to a workable 2,500. So when CAULK is the day’s answer, a player who neither builds homes or boats nor watches TV programmes where other people build homes might baulk at the reveal. “I thought I knew this person,” is the shape of the thought, “but I’ve no idea what they’re talking about today.” A relationship with someone who sets puzzles is like that. Dear Wordle player: those of us who solve a crossword after our morning’s Wordle are just like you. We witter at each other about how we’ve done; we appreciate a challenge that’s not too tricky but not too easy; we are prone to losing our minds if anyone relocates the puzzle. But … aren’t cryptic crosswords three times harder than Wordle? Not at all. They’re exactly three times easier. Indulge me? A little over a century ago, a man called Arthur Wynne – like Wardle, an expatriate Briton in the US – had to create a new kind of puzzle to occupy some space in the Christmas edition of a now defunct newspaper. His concoction was a quick crossword, and solvers of these puzzles know that guesswork is often involved, just as in Wordle, based on a word’s length, and having a sense of some of its letters. The crossword solver, though, gets more. They get a definition, too. And the gamechanger with a cryptic is that there’s a third way in. Here’s an example from the Guardian’s beginners puzzle, the quiptic: 20a Lounge with book in front of fire (5) Like in a Wordle, you might have up to three of the letters, say B __ A __ E. You’ve got a definition (this can come at either end of the clue; in this case, it’s “fire”). And in the unlikely event that this combination is not enough, the rest of the clue is a recipe for the answer’s letters: you take a word meaning “lounge” (LAZE) and plonk an abbreviation for “book” (B) in front. A total of three ways to BLAZE offered by our setter, Hectence. Hectence is one of the names you’ll get to know and have a relationship with; you can also meet these people and find out what makes them tick in our interviews. Here’s hers. You’ll have favourite setters (and perhaps ones you dread, but that’s not for now). You even get jokes. Most of all, though, you’ll keep getting three chances for every word. I’ll leave you with a clue from the setter who Guinness called “the world’s most prolific”, Rufus: 24a Fills cracks in the decks with stoppers, say (6) The crossing letters give you __ A __ L __ S, there’s a definition (“fills cracks in the decks”) and we also know that the answer sounds like a word which means “stoppers” (corks).

2/28/2022,"After turning 30 in 2018, Emmy made the life-changing decision to have a baby alone. “I had always really wanted children,” she says. “But when I did a fertility MOT, I discovered I had low egg reserves.” Single, and reluctant to wait for a suitable partner to come along, she began the process of IVF. “I naively thought it would work, but I had a couple of miscarriages in the early stages.” In February 2020, she travelled to Athens to try artificial insemination by a donor. “I’ve lived and worked in Greece and loved it. It was cheaper and I had friends to stay with,” she says. Before she landed, she matched on a dating app with a man from Liverpool called Andy, and they began to chat. “I’d been single for about four years and was quite happy in my own world,” he says. “But I was open to meeting someone and I found Emmy really engaging.” After the trip, Emmy returned briefly to her house in the Peak District before going to London for work. “I worked as a hair and makeup artist for films. I used to go to London all the time and lived in my caravan while I was there.” While in London, she experienced a chemical pregnancy, an early form of miscarriage. Although she was devastated, talking to Andy was a nice distraction. In March, Emmy went back home and arranged to meet Andy for a picnic. “We knew things were getting worse with Covid and wanted to be safe,” she says. “Andy has Crohn’s disease too, although we didn’t really know the full extent of the risks with the virus at the time.” Just before they were due to meet, Andy received a text message from the NHS advising him to shield. Shortly after, the rest of the country went into lockdown. During the next few weeks, Andy and Emmy spoke to each other for several hours a day through video and voice calls. “We got through the isolation period together,” says Andy. “In the evenings, we’d often watch a movie together in our own houses. It was really nice to have each other.” Emmy confided in him about her miscarriages. “He was really supportive,” she says. “There was something about his kindness and consistency that made me stay. I found myself missing him when I wasn’t talking to him.” In April, Emmy brought him his weekly shop and they sat on the steps outside his home and talked. Eventually, when the lockdown rules were relaxed, they were able to meet for a walk in a park. “It was the first time I’d been out of the house in three months,” says Andy. “It was lovely to have that first proper outing together.” Emmy formed a “support bubble” with Andy, and they began staying at each other’s houses regularly. He also helped with the gardening business she had set up during lockdown. “I was really careful and hardly saw anyone else as I was scared about giving Andy Covid,” she says. By August, they became an official couple and, soon after, Emmy revealed she was pregnant with his baby. “I was excited but wanted him to know there was a big chance I could miscarry.” Andy moved in that September but she lost the baby a few weeks later, which was followed by another miscarriage after Christmas. In 2021, Emmy was referred for a clinical trial for women who had experienced multiple miscarriages. “We saw a specialist and both overhauled our health and lifestyle, too,” she says. In June 2021, they found out Emmy was pregnant again. After being made redundant before lockdown, Andy found a new job with a wellbeing charity in Lancashire. Emmy went back to her old job, but is now doing more of her work from home. Emmy loves how affectionate Andy is, and says he has a positive impact on her mental and physical wellbeing. “Usually, when people meet in their 30s, they have so much going on they don’t want to make sacrifices. I don’t think our relationship would have happened if it wasn’t for Covid, but I’m really grateful it did.” While Andy is laidback, Emmy is more driven and organised. “We are like a jigsaw and our qualities fit together,” he says. “It’s a really nice balance. She kicks me up the bum, but I also calm her down. My life here is totally different from what my life was like in Liverpool, but I’d never change anything. For all the bad things the pandemic brought, it also made us stop and find each other.” Their little boy, Hughie, joined the family last week. Want to share your story?
