12/28/2021,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese citizens lashed out online against billionaire Tesla founder Elon Musk's space ambitions on Monday after China complained that its space station was forced to take evasive action to avoid collision with satellites launched by Musk's Starlink programme.    The satellites from Starlink Internet Services, a division of Musk's SpaceX aerospace company, had two ""close encounters"" with the Chinese space station on July 1 and Oct. 21, according to a document submitted by China earlier this month to the U.N.'s space agency.    ""For safety reasons, the China Space Station implemented preventive collision avoidance control,"" China said in a document published on the website of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs.    The complaints have not been independently verified. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.    In a post on China's Twitter-like Weibo microblogging platform on Monday, one user said Starlink's satellites were ""just a pile of space junk"", while another described them as ""American space warfare weapons"".    With nearly 30,000 satellites and other debris believed to be orbiting the planet, scientists have urged governments to share data to reduce the risk of catastrophic space collisions.    SpaceX alone has deployed nearly 1,900 satellites to serve its Starlink broadband network, and is planning more.    ""The risks of Starlink are being gradually exposed, the whole human race will pay for their business activities,"" a user posting under the name Chen Haiying said on Weibo.    U.S. space agency NASA was forced to abruptly call off a spacewalk at the end of November, citing risks posed by space debris. Musk tweeted in response that some Starlink satellite orbits had been adjusted to reduce the possibility of collisions.    China began constructing the space station in April with the launch of Tianhe, the largest of its three modules. The station is expected to be completed by the end of 2022 after four crewed missions.    Musk has become a well-known figure in China, though Tesla's electric-vehicle business has come under growing scrutiny from regulators, especially after a customer climbed on top of a Tesla car at the Shanghai auto show in April to protest against poor customer service.    (Reporting by Liangping Gao and David Stanway; Editing by Bernadette Baum) ",Business/Reuters,Chinese citizens slam Musk online after space station near-misses,https://news.yahoo.com/chinese-citizens-slam-musk-online-105555732.html
12/28/2021,"Retirement reform advocates in Washington have had a bumpy 2021. Multiple efforts to help people save more effectively for retirement, including one informally called SECURE 2.0, seemed to be on track for passage before Congress' other efforts crowded them out. But the effort may gain renewed traction in 2022. In a recent webinar co-hosted by Yahoo Finance and the Bipartisan Policy Center, Rep. Fred Keller (R-PA) said, “I think our chance for success in the upcoming year to get the SECURE 2.0 on the books is pretty positive.” Keller and other lawmakers have focused on one particular provision: linking retirement savings to student loan debt. The idea is to allow businesses to contribute to employees' retirement accounts when workers make their student loan payments. In other words, if you put $100 towards your student loan, your company could “match” it with up to $100 going into a retirement plan like a 401(k). The proposed law would help young people avoid missing out on years of valuable 401(k) matches. Currently, many people put off retirement saving in their early years even as experts often note that those exact years of saving are the most valuable, given the power of compound interest. Data from Bankrate suggests that college graduates with student loans often have to delay other priorities. Thirty-four percent report having delayed emergency savings, 23% say they have delayed buying a home, and 29% have delayed retirement savings. The idea to allow simultaneous loan payments and retirement savings has bounced around Washington for years, gaining support from Republicans as well as Democrats like Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. For his part, Keller thinks 2022 could be the moment for this idea.  “There's a lot of support from employers because they understand the importance of making sure that their workforce is secure,” Keller says. Those not fully on board with the idea note that one-third of private sector workers don’t have access to a retirement plan at work. Therefore, they argue, a new student loan and 401(k) feature wouldn’t necessarily help many Americans, especially those on the lower end of the income spectrum.  “Why aren't we fixing the tax code so that employers can actually just pay people’s student loans directly rather than just try and do this round-about system?” Jennifer Brown, a researcher at UnidosUS, told Yahoo Finance in 2019. But Keller calls this “a positive step” to help recent students.  “This, to me, is a thing that I think everybody can get behind because it's incentivizing people to save and the important part about this is it's not something where the government has to come up with money to put into this like you would have to in forgiveness and so forth,” he said.  Keller, who opposes student loan forgiveness, says the proposed SECURE 2.0 reforms are “a sustainable model” for how to help students that has a good chance of passage. “I look forward to doing everything we can to get this across the finish line in 2022,” he said. Other provisions in the legislation, called the Securing a Strong Retirement Act of 2021, concern raising the required minimum distribution age when people must start taking money out of their private retirement plans as well as measures to push employers to automatically enroll new employees in retirement plans. In late 2019, Congress passed ""SECURE 1.0,"" the first major retirement legislation in years; it included 401(k) provisions to help part-time workers save and improved access to annuities among other changes. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, House Ways and Means Ranking member Kevin Brady (R-TX) listed further retirement reforms as one of his top priorities for 2022. Noting that SECURE 2.0 has bipartisan support and would be “another significant reform to retirement savings,” he expressed hope that it could get done in the coming 12 months. For now, student debtors have a reprieve from paying off their federal student loans. The U.S. government paused federal student loan repayments through Jan. 31 in response to the pandemic, and President Joe Biden recently announced an extension through May 1.

12/28/2021,"Israel’s National Security Council has assumed control of a massive bird flu outbreak in the Galilee that scientists warn could become a “mass disaster” for humans. Over half a billion migrating birds pass through the area every year, heading for the warm African winters or the balmy summers in Europe, meaning this is a catastrophic location for a major bird flu outbreak right at the nexus of global avian travel. The virus is extremely deadly if it infects people. The World Health Organization says more than half of the confirmed 863 human cases it has tracked since 2003 proved to be fatal. Most strains or variants of avian flu, H5N1, are relatively difficult to transmit to people. Yossi Leshem, one of Israel’s most renowned ornithologists told The Daily Beast, however, that it it the ability of these viruses to mutate into new strains which is such a threat, as we have seen with the coronavirus. “There could be a mutation that also infects people and turns into a mass disaster,” said Leshem, zoologist at Tel Aviv University and director of the International Center for the Study of Bird Migration at Latrun. So far, at least 5,400 wild cranes have died infected with the new H5N1 avian flu, which Israeli authorities fear could expand into a global emergency. Of the 30,000 Eurasian cranes passing this winter at the Hula reserve, 17 percent are dead, and scientists fear the worst for their surviving brethren, at least 10,000 of which appear to be ailing. The infection of the cranes is the same strain of avian flu which infested chicken coops throughout northern Israel, and led to the cull in recent days of nearly a million birds. Israelis will be without their beloved chicken schnitzel—and without eggs—until a supply chain of imported birds is established. The COVID Theory That Got Your Hopes Up Is Actually Bullsh The deaths of thousands of wild birds in the Hula Nature Reserve, one of the world’s premiere bird sanctuaries, “is an extraordinary event with global ramifications,” warned Tel Aviv University Professor of Zoology Noga Kronfeld Shor in an interview with Reshet Bet Radio. Shor, who is also the chief scientist at Israel’s Ministry of the Environment, noted that the carcasses of other waterbirds, such as pelicans and egrets, have already been found. Israelis have been cautioned not to come near any wild birds that look sick and not to touch any bird droppings. Motro Yoav Motro, Director of Vertebrates and Locusts at Israel’s ministry of Agriculture, said that for now, H5N1 is presenting “like the opposite of COVID. Compared to COVID, the chances of [humans] catching this are very, very slight—but unlike COVID, the risks of dying from it if you do catch it are very high.” “It is a tragic ecological event,” he said. “And we simply do not know how it will end, or where it will lead.” Israeli scientists don’t yet know the full scale of the die-off in Israel because of the dangers inherent in fishing around marshes and wetlands while keeping safe from any possible infection. Observing birds that shy away from human contact and the urgent matter of retrieving bird carcasses is proving even more challenging because of the lack of waterproof protective gear currently available in the generally arid country. While the disaster is evident in the Hula Valley, in Israel’s fertile north, crane mortality has also been observed in other sites, though not yet in Jerusalem, according to Yotam Bashan of the Jerusalem Bird Observatory. “There is no way to know what is going to happen,” Motro said, in an interview with The Daily Beast. “When you identify avian flu in chicken coops you kill all the chickens and disinfect the coops. In the wild, at this level of infection, I don't know where it will lead. I'm worried.” Shalom Bar Tal, an experienced wildlife photographer, told The Daily Beast that he was one of the only people allowed nighttime access to observe the dead and dying birds.. It could turn into an ecological disaster no less significant than the corona epidemic,” he said. For now, no Israeli has been known to be infected by H5N1, but Israelis who were exposed to wild birds are taking the antiviral Tamiflu. Both Motro and Bar Tal noted the heartrending scenes of weak, infected cranes leaning over their dead. Cranes mate for life and live in strong family units, Motro said. “That means that when one dies, the rest of the family—I don’t know how to define it—but it mourns.” The cranes’ close physical proximity to each other and tightly knit family structure almost ensures, he said, that when one crane dies, “a close family member will be the next to die.” “There is no treatment,” he said, “no way to help.” We can only hope it doesn’t mutate and jump species.
