2/17/2022,"On Tuesday evening, Stephen Colbert tentatively celebrated the possibility that Russia would remove some troops from the Ukrainian border, de-escalating a tense international standoff that has threatened military conflict. “Ok, so Russia might be pulling out,” the Late Show host said. “That would be good, right, Joe?”  To quote Joe Biden on Tuesday: “That would be good, but we have not yet verified that, and danger remains distinctly possible.” “Ok, probably smart not to trust Vlad on this one – dudes like him never pull out when they say they will,” Colbert quipped. (Nato has since accused Russia of adding more troops to the border despite saying it would withdraw forces.) Information on troop movements has come from videos by Ukrainian and Russian civilians posted to TikTok, prompting some to refer to the conflict as “the TikTok war”. “Oh no, not a TikTok war! That would be … I don’t know what that would be. I’m 57,” said Colbert. “Instead of TikTok war, can it be just a longform podcast battle or a stack-of-old-New-Yorkers conflict?” In other news, the Oscars announced three hosts for its ceremony next month: Amy Schumer, Regina Hall, and Wanda Sykes. “Three hosts, meaning this year, there could be more people hosting the Oscars than watching them,” joked Colbert. “The Oscars are trying something new this year: caring what the audience thinks,” he added, by allowing Twitter users to vote on their favorite movies, whether it was nominated for an Oscar or not. The top-voted film will be recognized during the broadcast, and three Twitter users will also be selected for an all-expenses paid trip to Los Angeles to present at the 2023 ceremony. “So get ready to hear: ‘And now, presenting the award for best actor in a supporting role, Dame Helen Mirren and Twitter user @buttburgerpimp420,’” said Colbert. A look at the latest culture war tearing apart America’s schools: book bans. pic.twitter.com/tVbAirMDRy On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah discussed a wave of book ban attempts in American schools; since the start of the school year, the American Library Association has tracked over 230 book challenges in school districts across the country. Parents wanting some books banned from school libraries isn’t new – “conservatives wanted to ban Harry Potter for promoting witchcraft, liberals want to ban Huckleberry Finn for using the N-word, mockingbirds want to burn that book about killing them,” Noah explained. But the number of books targeted in recent months has soared, “and the types of books being targeted now are very revealing”. Namely, books on race, gender and sexuality, such as Maus, a Pulitzer-winning graphic novel on the Holocaust, books on school segregation and civil rights, even a biography of Michelle Obama. “I can’t believe these people want to ban a Michelle Obama biography. It’s a biography,” said Noah. “That totally gives away the game that this is more about ginning up a culture war than protecting kids.” “There’s no book about a first lady that’s controversial, you know? Unless maybe it’s Martha Jefferson’s book ‘101 Tips for Owning Slave Children Who Kinda Look Like My Husband,’” Noah joked. “Yeah, that’s a little edgy for the kids, but otherwise it’s pretty chill.” “This isn’t about books,” he concluded of the bans. “This is about keeping the culture war going for political benefit.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel reacted to news that Mazars, Donald Trump’s longtime accountancy firm, had severed ties with the former president amid ongoing criminal and civil investigations into whether he illegally inflated the worth of his assets. In a letter to the Trump Organization, the accounting firm acknowledged that its financial statements for Trump between June 2011 and June 2020 “should no longer be relied upon” – a conclusion “based, in part, upon the filings made by the New York attorney general on January 18, 2022, our own investigation, and information received from internal and external sources.” “In other words: we are not going to prison with you, Mr Trump,” said Kimmel. “There’s nothing more depressing than getting dumped by your accountant during tax season,” he added. “It’s like getting divorced on Christmas Eve. “I like the idea of Donald Trump now angrily setting up a TurboTax account to get his taxes done.” “A lot of people believe this could be it for Donald Trump, this could be the one,” he continued. “But I don’t know, how many ‘the ones’ have we had now? Like 400 or something? Last week we found out he was flushing documents down the toilet. The week before that he wanted Homeland Security to seize the voting machines. He’s still on the loose – what else do we need to know?”",Arts/Culture,Stephen Colbert on Putin and Ukraine: ‘Probably smart not to trust Vlad on this one’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/16/stephen-colbert-putin-ukraine-late-night-tv
2/17/2022,"Constituents of Steve Baker MP who are concerned about his environmental position have set up a “Steve Baker Watch” group and are launching a crowdfunding page to raise money. The constituents in Baker’s constituency of High Wycombe in the rolling Chiltern Hills believe that Baker is trying to “wreck the government plans to improve the environment”. Baker, who as chair of the European Research Group was instrumental in pressing for a hard Brexit, helped set up the Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG), which has close links to the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a lobbyist group that has been accused of denying climate science.  Last week the Guardian reported on fears that the group was trying to derail the government’s green agenda, linking it to the cost-of-living crisis and leading to fears of a “culture war” campaign around net zero. The campaigners told the Guardian: “Steve’s Net Zero Watch campaign will make people’s lives in Wycombe miserable. He wants to stop us getting cheaper clean energy, insulating our homes and creating a better future for our children. We’ve had enough!” They plan to “educate” local people about their MP’s views on climate action, including doing leaflet drops, holding vigils outside his office and setting up a website. Baker told the Guardian: “I see the people associated with this campaign come from opposition parties in the constituency. I am thankful for everything they are doing to highlight that the voters of Wycombe will be poorer and colder unless we change course as I am setting out. “We all care for the planet but our current net zero strategy only works for those who can afford much higher bills. If this is what local Lib Dems and Labour want then I’m happy to explain that to voters.” The group, however, says it does not represent any political faction. It said: “We’re a group of concerned citizens who care about climate change and the lives of ordinary people. We don’t represent any political party.” The NZSG group, which has gained widespread media coverage in the past month despite being small in number, says it does not dispute climate science or the need to decarbonise. It has called for cuts to green taxes and an increase in fossil fuel production to address the energy crisis, and recently pushed for fracking in the UK.",News/Environment,Constituents set up ‘Steve Baker Watch’ over MP’s climate stance,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/16/constituents-set-up-steve-baker-watch-over-mps-climate-stance
2/17/2022,"Iwas told by someone who’d been on an intensive course of self-improvement that we need to identify three important moments in our childhoods: when we first experience fear; when we first feel we don’t fit in; and when it dawns on us that we are alone in the world. Or something like that. I’ve no idea if these things are particularly important, but I can’t stop thinking about them. I bawled my eyes out when I was first taken to nursery school. I don’t think that was fear as such, more that I was just a bit of a wuss. Anyway, I bawled at such length and volume that my mummy was asked to come and take me away and never bring me back. This suited me.  Apparently, first fears are commonly felt in the moments you are conscious of being separated from your parents, or lost. I was briefly lost once when I was little, in a crowded airport somewhere. A stranger lifted me on to his shoulders so someone could claim me. I was terrified, but that was because I knew what kind of hiding awaited me from my mum when she got hold of me, furious at my wandering off. No, I first knew proper terror when I was about eight and realised that my grandad would die one day before long. This was awful to know, quite impossible to get my head around. I cried and shook in bed. The horror soon deepened when it dawned on me that the same fate awaited my dad. Appalled, I wailed in even deeper terror at this new knowledge, but not half as loudly as I did when the penny dropped that this unpleasant mortality business applied to me too. I would die one day. I was gripped by this fear night after night. I became frightened of going to bed. As for when I first felt I didn’t fit in, I’m not sure I’ve ever felt that. And when did I first realise that I was alone in the world? It’s probably somewhat to my discredit that I’m not sure I’ve ever felt that either. There’s a saying that you only feel properly grown up once both of your parents have died. Deluded I may well be, but I can never feel alone in the world as long as my parents are yet to join the great majority. Childish, really. It’s not that I consider them infallible – I don’t think either of them is right about much any more – but knowing they care about me is enough. All this has got me wondering how the children of the pandemic, those of early or preschool age, might answer the above questions in years to come. In the darkest days of the last two years, millions of them were cooped up at home with concerned parents who couldn’t shield the kids from what was happening. All these nippers must have caught sight of some news bulletins, on which they’ll have seen something no other cohort of kids in history ever had to see: evidence that for a good while there wasn’t a single grownup in the world who had a clue what was going on. This is quite something for young minds to compute. It is probably the first real fear millions of today’s kids have experienced and, with the adults at sixes and sevens, a strong indication that they’ll have to start figuring things out for themselves. I suppose that sooner or later everyone needs to realise that no one knows anything but, as with stuff about sex, mortgages, mortality and Santa Claus, that truth can wait.

2/17/2022,"The story of Charlie Chaplin only gets more incredible as the years go by: the man who left behind poverty and the workhouse to become the inventor of cinema, celebrity and modernity. As his movies took off, his globally adored “little tramp” character became mass produced, like the Ford Model T or the populist political movements of interwar history. In his heyday, Chaplin’s wealth and fame fused together to create something beyond anything people had conceived those two things to be. No wonder his triumph created a residue of wariness and resentment among America’s governing classes, which spilled out into outright red-scare rage when Chaplin, the bumptious autodidact and autocrat, opened his mouth about communism. Film-makers Peter Middleton and James Spinney are well positioned to take advantage of this enduringly potent real-life legend with their own retelling; they also use new archive material of press conferences and interviews, which they transform with “verbatim cinema” reconstruction techniques. Anything like this inevitably stands in the shadow of David Robinson’s mighty 1985 biography, which set the gold-standard for Chaplin studies and inspired Richard Attenborough’s 1992 biopic starring Robert Downey Jr. But interestingly this documentary moves away, just a little, from the unitary single-stranded heroic biography – to the multi-faceted question of Chaplin’s elusive personae, with and without voice, with and without moustache, with and without political opinions. No matter how often I see it, Chaplin’s non-moustache face is thrillingly naked and strange: with upper lip exposed, the quirky little sketch of a face suddenly evolves into something hyper-intelligent, ambitious, sensual. And this film is more concerned to give Chaplin’s wives more of a presence, rather than being simply walk-on players in the tabloid-gossip farce about the great genius’s weakness for sex.  Chaplin’s amazing story is something that would have electrified Charles Dickens, that other workhouse survivor who conquered the US. In fact, Chaplin probably became something that Dickens would have dreamed of being in the future century, and what he might have imagined for one of his characters. This film recounts Chaplin’s almost superhuman success, his mythic reach into the hearts and minds of millions of people all over the world – because of silent cinema. Language was no barrier and Charlie/Charlot was universal. Fascinatingly, tragically, the coming of the talkies is what took Chaplin, briefly, up to the next plane before bringing him down, and the film convincingly argues that his famous closing speech in the great anti-Nazi film The Great Dictator, audaciously playing on his own resemblance to Hitler, planted the seed of his downfall. As the Jewish barber mistaken for a despot, Chaplin’s hero makes a passionate oration pleading for democracy and human understanding, a speech he was invited to reprise at Roosevelt’s presidential inauguration. It undoubtedly irritated many on the right, while giving Chaplin a new taste for political speech-making and bien-pensant prestige, which only infuriated the reactionaries of the FBI and the press still further. Chaplin was to become the most famous victim of the HUAC red scare – more important, surely, than Dalton Trumbo and the “Hollywood Ten”. He was finally forced into exile in Switzerland, although this film spares us the macabre story of what was to happen to his body after burial. This film may not have all that much new material but it piercingly asks the right questions about Chaplin’s elusive reality.  The Real Charlie Chaplin is released on 18 February in cinemas.",Arts/Film,The Real Charlie Chaplin review – the elusive personality of the little tramp,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/16/the-real-charlie-chaplin-review-peter-middleton-james-spinney
2/17/2022,"A Chinese informant for MI6, now serving a life sentence for murder in a British jail, has given information about the telecommunications company Huawei to the parliamentary intelligence and security committee (ISC), the Guardian has learned. He has been thanked by the chair of the committee, the senior Conservative backbencher Dr Julian Lewis, and told that he had raised “several important areas of concern” and that the committee’s findings may be “of interest” to him.  The revelation comes amid concern about Chinese infiltration into British politics. The controversy over Huawei has also resurfaced with the disclosure that Guto Harri, the prime minister’s new communications director, lobbied a former chief of staff at Downing Street not to ban the Chinese company. Wang Yam, who was found guilty in 2009 of the murder of the author Alan Chappelow, a crime of which he continues to protest his innocence, contacted the committee last year. He sent the ISC – and a number of prominent individuals – documents about his knowledge of the background and intentions of the Chinese telecommunications company, Huawei, and the potential risks in Britain’s involvement in the company, particularly its 5G infrastructure. He has long claimed in letters from prison that he provided MI6 with detailed warnings and information about Huawei. Yam, a grandson of Chairman Mao Zedong’s third-in-command, was a research assistant in the Chinese nuclear weapons research institute. He fled China via Hong Kong and was granted refugee status in Britain in 1992. It is accepted that he was an MI6 informant. In a letter responding to Wang, currently in Lowdham Grange prison in Nottingham, the chair of the committee, Lewis, wrote: “You discuss several important areas of concern regarding the influence of China generally and Huawei in particular within the UK’s telecommunications infrastructure and public sector. As you may be aware, the ISC is currently conducting an inquiry into the national security issues relating to China. “The committee noted the significance of Huawei to the UK’s 5G infrastructure in April 2019 and announced that it would prioritise this aspect of its inquiry. I cannot comment on the substance of the inquiry which is ongoing but you may find the committee’s conclusion and recommendations of interest when it lays its findings before parliament.” Huawei has previously said it had never engaged in espionage or allowed its technology to be knowingly hacked by the Chinese state. Lewis told the Guardian that the committee “noted the policy issues raised by Mr Yam: the ISC is currently conducting an inquiry into the national security threat posed by China”. He also noted that Wang Yam also raised several points about his “personal issues” – a reference to his trials and his complaints against the intelligence agencies. He referred Yam to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) which he said was the appropriate body for him to contact. The IPT investigates allegations of unlawful activities of state bodies, including the security and intelligence agencies. Yam also told the Guardian that his correspondence with the “relevant authorities” in the US had met with a sympathetic response and an assurance that his points were taken “most seriously.” Yam was recruited as an informant by MI6 after defecting from China and being granted refugee status in the UK in 1992. He was assigned to making contacts with Chinese embassy staff, he has claimed. Chappelow, an 86-year-old author and photographer, was found dead in his home in Hampstead, north London in 2006, after police had been alerted by his bank following suspicious transactions. Use of his stolen credit cards was traced to Wang Yam, who lived nearby and was later arrested in Switzerland. His initial Old Bailey trial in 2008 was held under unprecedented levels of secrecy for a murder case. Journalists were not allowed to attend court to hear the defence. The prosecution suggested that Yam was confronted by Chappelow as he stole letters and bank information from his post box before entering his house and killing him. Yam was convicted of theft and fraud but the jury could not reach a decision on the murder charge. At a second trial, he was convicted of murder and jailed for a minimum of 20 years. From prison, he contacted the Guardian protesting his innocence. Following an article in the paper in 2014, new witnesses emerged, leading to a referral back to the court of appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. A near neighbour of Chappelow told the appeal court that, soon after the murder and with Yam already in custody, he was confronted by an intruder who told him: “Do not call the police or we will kill your wife and baby.” Another witness gave evidence that Chappelow was a regular visitor to the “spanking bench” on Hampstead Heath and he had seen him there shortly before his death leaving with young men. There were also fresh footprints and cigarette butts found in the house that did not relate to Wang Yam. Despite the new evidence, which his lawyers argued would have almost certainly led to an acquittal at his original trial, the appeal was turned down. There is now a possibility that fresh developments in DNA testing could assist in a further appeal. There are also plans for a film, according to Thomas Harding, author of the prize-winning book on the case, Blood on the Page. Yam has complained to the IPT about the way he was treated by MI6 and that the agency asked him to participate in unlawful activities. His lawyer, Edward Preston, confirmed that an application had been made to the IPT, which did not respond to the Guardian’s request for a comment. The potential threat Huawei presents to British interests and competing commercial and security interests has preoccupied the ISC and the intelligence agencies for many years. Back in 2013 the ISC released a stinging report into the way the government handled contracts with Huawei. Seven years later, British telecoms providers were banned from installing Huawei equipment in Britain’s 5G mobile network.",News/Technology,Chinese MI6 informant gives information about Huawei,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/16/chinese-mi6-informant-wang-yam-gives-information-about-huawei
2/17/2022,"Google announced on Wednesday that it plans to limit the amount of personal information shared on Android, the world-leading mobile phone operating system used by more than 2.5 billion people around the globe. The shift comes a year after Apple curtailed the amount of personal data shared by users of its mobile operating system – a change that sent shock waves through the digital advertising world and contributed to a major collapse in Facebook’s share price.  In a blogpost Anthony Chavez, vice-president of product management, Android security and privacy, noted that advertising plays a “key role” in allowing the majority of mobile apps to be free but added that “the industry must continue to evolve how digital advertising works to improve user privacy”. Android’s operating system runs on about 72% of mobile devices worldwide compared with Apple’s rival iOS, which runs on about 26.9% of devices. The change is likely to upend the digital advertising market – limiting the massive amounts of data that app companies collect from their users. But it also comes at a time when Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is coming under ever greater scrutiny from regulators around the world over its dominance of digital advertising. The news is likely to trigger concerns that the Android changes will further cement Alphabet’s dominance in mobile ads. In an apparent swipe at Apple Chavez said the changes would be made over the next two years and in conjunction with the industry. ​​“We realize that other platforms have taken a different approach to ads privacy, bluntly restricting existing technologies used by developers and advertisers. We believe that – without first providing a privacy-preserving alternative path – such approaches can be ineffective and lead to worse outcomes for user privacy and developer businesses,” wrote Chavez. Last year Apple updated its mobile system to force apps to ask for users’ permission in order to track them around the web. The company has long positioned itself as a champion of privacy and its chief executive, Tim Cook, has regularly clashed with the Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg over the ethics – and value – of unfettered data sharing. The clash came to a head earlier this month when Zuckerberg blamed Apple’s changes for a disastrous set of earnings that led to a record-setting fall in Facebook owner Meta’s share price.",News/Technology,Google to limit amount of personal information shared on Android,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/16/google-android-personal-information-limit-apple

While giving remarks at the National Association of Counties 2022 Legislative Conference in Washington, he president spoke about his time representing what he described as a mixed-income district.  He said at one point he fielded a request from a wealthier Republican woman who had a dead dog on her lawn. “I got a call one night; the woman said to me – obviously not of the same persuasion as I was politically – called me and said: ‘There’s a dead dog on my lawn,’” said Biden, telling the story. “And I said: ‘Yes, ma’am.’ I said: ‘Have you called county?’ She said: ‘Yes, they’re not here.’ And I said: ‘Well, I’ll get them in the morning.’” The woman was not satisfied by Biden’s answer, telling Biden that she wanted the dog off her lawn now and that she paid his salary. So Biden responded in kind: “So I went over,” said Biden as the conference crowd laughed and applauded. “I picked it up. She said: ‘I want it out of my front yard.’ I put it on her doorstep. “But I’ve gotten much better since then,” said Biden after wrapping up the story.

2/17/2022,"Camille Pissarro isn’t worried if he looks past it with his big white beard. He doesn’t care if he appears weak. He looks straight back at you from his self-portrait at the start of this exhibition, over the top of his spectacles, aged and maybe myopic. He is staring in the mirror, seeing himself honestly, with a grey Paris street on view through the window behind him.  Pissarro’s belief in art as a fundamentally honest enterprise shines through in this intimate exhibition that digs into avant-garde lives. His warmth is disarming. There are portraits of his wife, Julie, who was a cook’s assistant in his parents’ house when he fell in love with her, and some of their eight children, especially Lucien, who was evidently the apple of his father’s eye and grew up to become an artist. A drawing of a family picnic by his second son, Georges remembers a childhood among geniuses: while Julie cooks on a campfire, white-bearded dad talks to friends including Gauguin. Another friend, Cézanne, ignores them to paint the landscape. The Ashmolean Museum has called its show Father of Impressionism and this reflects Pissarro’s status among his friends: they nicknamed him “father Pissarro”, for he was already well into his 40s when the first impressionist exhibition was held in Paris in 1874. Perhaps it should have been called Modernist Dad. For Pissarro was always pushing art forward. He had no religious faith in a single style. He was Jewish but his wife wasn’t, and it is clear that politics meant more to him than religion. A drawing from 1889 depicts black-suited brokers on the Paris Bourse, the French stock exchange: it was intended for an unfinished book satirising the bourgeoisie with words by an anarchist friend. Pissarro does not fit anyone’s cliche of impressionism – which may be why he is less famous than Monet, Renoir or Degas. You think the impressionists’ delight in immediate sensations was all about celebrating middle-class pleasure? Pissarro is more interested in the workers. He makes a point of showing women at work, trudging through a field with firewood, driving stakes into the ground to grow peas, lighting a bonfire on a breezy morning. His 1886-88 canvas View from My Window is a widescreen epic of a landscape, every detail equally observed with a pointillist precision inspired by his young friends Paul Signac and the anarchist critic Félix Fénéon. But in the equal, underemphasised field of bright pixellated colour, your eyes come to rest on a farm worker doing her chores while hens cluck around her. Pissarro always makes you think, not feel. He is obsessed with the nature of vision – but does not trust it. Those rheumy old eyes in his self-portrait are acutely aware of what gets in the way of seeing. In his great 1877 painting The Côte des Boeufs at L’Hermitage, he gives us broken glimpses of village houses through the thick barred window of a winter woodland: the trees are in the way, but are they the real subject? Pissarro points the way to the next generation of modern painters in these subtle meditations on what we select to see from the constant variety of our visual perceptions. Spring: Plum Trees in Bloom makes you choose between two foci, a group of houses on a hillside and the snowstorm of white plum blossoms that gets in the way. In The Pork Butcher, a market crowd is seen as a deliberately confused and broken visual field: who are we meant to look at, what is the story here? Of course we need to look at everyone and there is no single, simple story. Pissarro didn’t just point the way to radical new visions. He warmly supported young friends whose difficult characters went with revolutionary perceptions. Gauguin and Cézanne worked side by side with kind father Pissarro in Pontoise, just outside Paris. Cézanne’s own painting of the Pontoise countryside hangs next to Pissarro’s woods hiding houses – he uses the same trick, showing houses in a valley through a thick screen of leafy trees. You can see how Pissarro helped him to look at the stuff we are schooled to ignore. But what gratitude did Pissarro get? After the Jewish army officer Alfred Dreyfus was falsely convicted of treason in 1894 the resulting fight for his pardon brought out frightening antisemitism, not just in French society but the impressionist movement itself. Pissarro and Monet supported Dreyfus. Cézanne, however, sided with the right. Even worse was Pissarro’s old pal Degas, whose early prints, donealongside Pissarro, are here. Degas crossed the street to avoid Pissarro. Given how rawly he was betrayed, I would rather have seen less of the other artists in this show, and instead a more passionate championing of Pisarro’s own genius. The power of Cézanne and Gauguin transcends their terrible characters and threatens to steal the show: there’s even a stupendous Cézanne still life loaned by MoMA in New York. Nice guys finish last in art history, it seems.

2/17/2022,"Former Post Office workers affected by the IT scandal at the company said their lives “fell apart” and that they were left feeling “worthless” and shunned after being wrongly convicted. Victims called for the company’s former management to be jailed for their part in the long-running scandal, the inquiry heard on an emotional third day of evidence.  More than 700 post office operators were prosecuted between 2000 and 2014, based on information from the Horizon IT system, installed and maintained by Fujitsu. William Graham, 53, managed the Riverhead sub-post office, near Sevenoaks, when he was convicted for the concealment of supposed losses of £65,521 in January 2011. He received a suspended prison sentence, and was one of 39 former workers prosecuted after the Horizon system falsely suggested there were cash shortfalls to have their convictions quashed by the court of appeal in April 2021. Fighting back tears, Graham told the inquiry his conviction had left him feeling “worthless”. He said: “I visited the area with my wife and we were basically told ‘we shouldn’t be speaking to you, we shouldn’t talk to you, we shouldn’t be seen to be talking to you’. “Anyone I had on Facebook, social media, anything like that, immediately went. As soon as I was accused of theft, not even found guilty of anything: it was all my old customers on there … I just felt worthless, I felt worthless to my family, I felt they all saw me as a guilty person and, on paper, I was.” He paid tribute to his wife, who stood by him throughout the ordeal, and said: “If it wasn’t for her, I probably wouldn’t be here now. I would have got to a stage where I felt like I wouldn’t want to be here. I wanted it all gone.” Graham said he wanted the Post Office to admit “what went wrong” and when it knew about it. Harjinder Butoy, 45, ran the Sutton-in-Ashfield branch with his wife in Nottinghamshire until he was arrested, charged and jailed for three years and three months in 2008 for stealing £208,000. When the guilty verdict came in, he said: “I just fell apart,” adding that he “wasn’t prepared for it”. He went on to describe his “terrible” experience in prison, where he lost more than six stone and was “stressed every day”. “I kept thinking how did I end up here, just thinking about my family,” he said. “Everything has just fallen apart for me. I have no confidence in myself any more.” On what he wants from the Post Office now, he said: “I want somebody to go to prison.” Gillian Howard, 62, took over running New Mill Post Office in West Yorkshire after her husband suffered a stroke. She said she contemplated suicide when the branch was audited on 27 May 2010. “I actually drove to a viaduct that one of my customers had recently jumped off,” she said. “He was such a placid, lovely man and I thought if he can do it, so can I. “I sat in the car, no mobile phone with me … I talked to myself and I thought about my family … I knew I had to return and face whatever they were going to find and I didn’t know what they were going to find. “I suspected a shortfall but I hadn’t counted it, I’d just balanced.” She pleaded guilty to fraud in relation to an alleged £45,850.05 shortfall, receiving a six-month community sentence order. She found out she was being prosecuted on the morning of her daughter’s wedding, which she said was the “worst day of my life”.

2/17/2022,"Tate Britain has commissioned a new artwork to be exhibited alongside a mural containing racist imagery, after discussions with historians, artists, cultural advisers and civic representatives. The new installation will be “in dialogue” with the floor-to-ceiling mural by Rex Whistler in what was formerly a restaurant at the London gallery.  A report by the Tate ethics committee concluded in 2020 that the mural was “unequivocally … offensive”. The committee called for a bold approach in contextualising the mural but said it should not be altered or removed. The new artwork will be joined by interpretative material that will “critically engage with the mural’s history and content, including its racist imagery”, Tate said in an announcement on Wednesday. The artist who will create the new work has not yet been chosen, but Tate said the room containing the mural and the new installation will open to the public next winter. Alex Farquharson, the director of Tate Britain, said Whistler’s mural was “part of our institutional and cultural history and we must take responsibility for it, but this new approach will also enable us to reflect the values and commitments we hold today and to bring new voices and ideas to the fore”. Tate’s move comes amid widespread debate about art, statues and monuments that have racist or colonial imagery or associations. Some campaigners have called for the removal of such works from the public sphere, while others have argued that they should be explained and contextualised. The mural, The Expedition in Pursuit of Rare Meats, was commissioned in 1926 when Whistler was 21, and completed in 1927. It is one of the artist’s most significant works, according to Tate. It tells the story of an imagined hunting expedition and includes images of a black child being kidnapped and enslaved and caricatures of Chinese figures. In 2018 Tate presented an explanatory text on the mural’s racial content, and in 2020 the room was closed as a restaurant. A discussion group with five co-chairs was set up to explore options regarding the future of the mural. The group’s recommendations were approved by Tate’s board of trustees this month. Amia Srinivasan, of All Souls Oxford and a co-chair, said discussions about the mural were “open, rigorous and filled with good-natured but deep disagreement … One of the few points of consensus was that Tate had to take ownership of its history, and that whatever decision was made had to be an invitation to a broader conversation, not the end of one.” David Dibosa, of the University of the Arts London and another co-chair, said the discussions had “not been easy”. He added: “I stand side by side with those who seek to address the difficulties of the past honestly and fearlessly. It takes enormous courage to face our faults.” Whistler, one of the “Bright Young Things”, a group of London socialites in the 1920s, was killed in action in the second world war.",Arts/Art and design,Tate’s ‘unequivocally offensive’ mural to have new work alongside it,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/16/tate-britain-rex-whistler-mural-racist-imagery-new-work
