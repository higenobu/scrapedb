3/15/2022,"Into the mix of the spiralling energy cost crisis came two opinions that were fascinating for different reasons. The first was from the radical accountant Richard Murphy, a member of the Tax Justice Network, who did a breakdown of energy costs, trying to get to the bottom of why prices were rising so precipitously. I assumed that his thoughts would contain a lot of graphs, which I would fast cease to comprehend the minute they stopped being pie charts, but in fact it was devastatingly simple. Only 36% of “a typical bill” comprises the actual cost of energy, the rest being tax, delivery, billing, customer services, environmental schemes and profit. So even if the price of gas doubles, triples, goes wild, only just over a third of your bill should double, triple or go wild, the other costs being static, give or take inflation. Murphy posed a second question, why should people who get their energy from renewables suffer the same hikes? He ran some speculative numbers on how much of your new bill would go towards energy company profits. He could find no explanation for the coming price rises, beyond exploitation. The other opinion was from Martin Lewis, the founder of Money Saving Expert, a far less political figure than Murphy. It takes a certain sort of sober person to bring his amount of seriousness and purpose to making sure you’re on exactly the right mobile phone tariff. Speaking to the Today programme last week, he was absolutely fiery. He would not stand by and listen to a Conservative minister blaming the war in Ukraine for the cost of living crisis. He would not accept that anyone could weather the coming squeeze with a bit of planning and tweaking. His predictions were absolutely stark – without serious intervention by the chancellor, poverty was set to become so severe that civil unrest would follow. When financial experts are this interesting, it is time to really worry. But, also, thank God for interesting accountants dragging corporate flam-flam and political diversion tactics back to reality.

3/15/2022,"The most successful all-female band of all time – according to the US Billboard charts – remains to this day the Go-Go’s, an irreverent and combustible new wave five-piece formed in the crucible of the LA punk scene who went to No 1 in the US in 1982 with their debut album, Beauty and the Beat. This excellent memoir from their bassist, Kathy Valentine, forms part of a charm offensive that includes a much-praised 2020 documentary and dates supporting Billy Idol in the UK in June. It should not be important, in this day and age, but given Damon Albarn’s recent, since-retracted, comments questioning Taylor Swift’s songwriting, it bears repeating: the Go-Go’s were a girl gang who wrote their own songs. And had female management. And inspired female musicians from the Bangles, their obvious heirs, to Kathleen Hanna, who went on to form Bikini Kill. Sure, there’s a Terry Hall credit on one of their biggest hits, Our Lips Are Sealed, but the song was based on letters Hall exchanged with Go-Go’s guitarist Jane Wiedlin while the two were an item. Although the Go-Go’s were an LA phenomenon and didn’t hit as hard in the UK, Valentine’s mother is British, and it was when the two were visiting relatives that Valentine saw Suzi Quatro on Top of the Pops. The planet immediately tilted to a more rakish angle. All I Ever Wanted is full of British cameos: the nanosecond she was in an early lineup of Girlschool called Painted Lady, the time when Go-Go’s singer Belinda Carlisle out-partied Rod Stewart, how they shared a label, IRS, with the Police. When Beauty and the Beat overtook the Police’s Ghost in the Machine in the US charts while the bands toured together, the Police produced champagne. One of the unexpected recurrences within this often jaw-dropping memoir is exactly how supportive male musicians were of the Go-Go’s, how Keith Richards drawled “we’re all in the same union” when Valentine sidled up to him for a cigarette in the studio, asking whether she could listen in on a guitar solo Jimmy Page was overdubbing. The Eurythmics’ Dave Stewart is unmasked as a gentleman. Like drummer Gina Schock, Valentine wasn’t a Go-Go from the very start. But the definitive fivesome swiftly gelled into a 10-legged hell-raising machine, with Valentine switching from guitar to bass and learning all the parts for her audition in a cocaine-fuelled few days. She brought pivotal songs to the band: Can’t Stop the World, on Beauty and the Beat, and Vacation, the title track of their second album. As well as telling the enthralling saga of how the Go-Go’s got big through hard work, hard partying and great tunes, this is Valentine’s personal bout of forensics. Her arc has a candour, clarity and retrospective warmth born of sobriety and therapy. Valentine can write. She talks of trouble afoot like “trying to keep smoke behind a door”. She did way too much, way too young, a Texan backstory full of eye-popping under-parenting, nasty high schools and alternative educational settings both formal and informal. Valentine is heart-breakingly honest about a rape and the termination in its aftermath. But there were good men, too: her mother’s boyfriend taught her to play guitar. At a critical juncture, she meets the Runaways, starring Joan Jett. The Sex Pistols and Blondie come through town, adding inspirational fuel to her ambitions. Valentine’s enthusiasm for drink and drugs were not exactly out of place in rock’n’roll circles. The band’s five years in the sun were basically one long bender – gleeful, sisterly and prank-filled, until, that is, the band’s habits became problematic and they started factionalising and mismanaging their affairs. The songwriters out-earned the non-songwriters. They alienated their long-suffering and astute manager, Ginger Canzoneri. Wiedlin left to go solo and have a hit with Rush Hour. What happens when success ends is often more fascinating than the ride beforehand. The years in which Valentine tried and failed to recreate a band for herself are like a car crash you can’t look away from. Valentine’s long-suffering boyfriend, Clem Burke of Blondie, buoys her, but they eventually part ways. Singer-songwriter Carlene Carter is a buddy, and Johnny and June Carter Cash (Carlene’s mother) pay a big hotel bill Valentine is unable to – refunded, with shame and gratitude, when Valentine later makes amends on the 12-step programme. There is less here on the later years of the band’s reunion. Valentine actually sued the band in 2013, settling out of court. But what resonates is that the Go-Go’s didn’t just have “girl band” problems – they had universal ones.  All I Ever Wanted by Kathy Valentine is published by Jawbone (£14.95).

3/15/2022,"In July 2020 I moved into a rental property which had Scottish Power (SP) prepayment meters for both electricity and gas. After several fruitless attempts to arrange for a credit meter to be fitted, I lost patience and, in June 2021, transferred the account to British Gas. A month later, SP sent me a bill for £647 for the gas account. As it was a prepay account, it was obviously a mistake but SP refused to accept it. I complained but was ignored, so I escalated the complaint and was, again, ignored. I finally contacted the Energy Ombudsman. SP proposed a remedy to the ombudsman: it would apply the missing payments to my account, close the account, send me a final statement of £0 along with a written apology explaining what went wrong, and £140 in compensation. I accepted this and SP was given 28 days to implement the resolution. It hasn’t happened and I am at my wits’ end. I simply cannot get SP to resolve this and the ombudsman is laughably toothless, refusing to take any sort of stand despite the clear lack of cooperation. EL, by email This is an edited version of a very long letter detailing your very poor treatment by SP and the inability of the ombudsman to get the company to resolve a problem that should have been easy to fix. As my Observer colleague Anna Tims has often highlighted, the company’s billing operation can be a disaster zone for consumers. In 2016 it was fined £18m by the regulator for failing to provide even the basic level of service. If our postbag and Trustpilot ratings are representative, Ofgem needs to look at the company again. I asked SP about your case and it has finally resolved the matter. It has apologised and blamed an error within the national gas meter database resulting in your payments going to another supplier.

3/15/2022,"Lateral flow tests could cost care home visitors £73 a month, a leading UK charity has said, as it renewed calls to keep the devices free in such settings. The government has previously announced that free testing for the general public will end from 1 April, and that this will include care home visitors. However, charities have warned the shift away from free tests could place a heavy financial burden on those visiting care homes, where testing is still advised. Boots has announced it will offer the devices at £2.50 for one or £12 for a pack of five, or £17 for a pack of four with the extra option to send results to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). James White, the head of public affairs and campaigns at the Alzheimer’s Society, said the proposed charge on lateral flow tests for visitors to care homes was a cruel tax on care. “Over the past two years, we’ve consistently heard many tragic stories from families struggling to visit their loved ones in care homes. For many people with dementia, this isolation has led to a significant deterioration in their condition and mental health,” he said. “With infection rates rising once again, the government must provide free lateral flow tests for all visitors to care homes so that families are not put in an agonising position where they are forced to ration visits, leaving people with dementia once again isolated and alone.” Dr Sam Royston, the director of policy and research at Marie Curie, which runs hospices, also raised concerns. “Without the provision of free testing, many people living with a terminal illness and their families will face additional costs at a time when we know people are often struggling. This extra cost would put further strain and pressure on people’s lives at a time when their basic living costs are already rising exponentially due to the high cost of living and energy,” he said. “For those who can’t afford the extra financial burden of paying for testing, this could lead to more people facing further social isolation towards the end of life.” The Alzheimer’s Society is running a petition to keep testing free for care home visitors – which has been signed by more than 7,000 people – with the charity suggesting there are a number of options to do so, including providing tests to care homes or sending weekly tests to essential caregivers. Caroline Abrahams, Age UK’s charity director, said: “No one should have to pay out of their own pocket for tests in circumstances where the expert advice is clear that testing remains an important safeguard against Covid,” she said. “If care home visitors are going to continue to be asked to keep testing to protect their loved ones, it would be completely unacceptable to expect them to pay.” The concerns come as data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests infection levels in the UK are on the rise once more, with the proportion of those over 70 who had Covid in the most recent week the highest since the ONS survey began. The Department of Health and Social Care currently advises that testing for visitors to care homes should continue, in line with the wider care home testing regime. However the Guardian understands measures around testing as well as infection, prevention and control measures – including for care home visiting – are currently under review. The DHSC has said further details are to be set out by 1 April. The DHSC is also soon expected to announce which at-risk groups will be eligible for free symptomatic testing. At present, it is thought this will include people over 80 or with compromised immune systems, as well as NHS and social care staff. A DHSC spokesperson said: “As set out in the government’s Living With Covid plan, the approach to managing Covid-19 in adult social care services will continue to evolve in the coming months. We will continue to focus on providing care for those that need it and supporting people who are most vulnerable to Covid-19.”",News/World news,Lateral flow tests could cost care home visitors £73 a month,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/lateral-flow-tests-could-cost-care-home-visitors-73-a-month
3/15/2022,"It is fair to say there has been reasonable progress for women in political leadership and decision-making in the past three decades. Yet, 27 years after the Beijing declaration at the world conference on women, adopted by 189 countries and seen as the key moment for radical change in gender equality, too much remains the same. Since 2015, women in almost every country have had the right to vote, at least in theory. The world has seen impressive female leaders including Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Mia Mottley, Angela Merkel and Jacinda Ardern. A few countries, such as Finland, even have cabinets dominated by women. These achievements have in large part happened because of measures invoked since the Beijing conference. However, there has been very slow progress in other areas. In Zimbabwe, women remain under-represented in party politics, in parliament and in cabinet. Deep-seated patriarchal and political violence are sustained by legacies of masculinised nationalist politics that helped liberate Zimbabwe from equally patriarchal colonial rule. Masculinised nationalism finds powerful expression through Zanu-PF, the ruling party for more than four decades. Women make up less than 50% of parliamentarians, yet gender parity is a constitutional requirement. Since independence in 1980, there has not been a female president. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission only registered five female voters in one of the country’s biggest provinces, Mashonaland Central last year. Women are excluded from political processes, to the detriment of society. The mere fact of being a woman does not give one the right to lead. Both men and women must be held to the same standards of non-patriarchal values, integrity, accountability, transparency; these are all key components of ethical leadership, regardless of gender. We should focus on choosing leaders who connect with people, drive positive social change, focus on uplifting their communities. In my journey as a relatively young woman in politics, I have observed and experienced prejudices and stereotypes. Sometimes, when I open my mouth to speak, instead of engaging with the content, my audience will ask: “But why aren’t you married?” Instead of taking issue with the government and fighting the system, I’m told I should get married and have children. Some sexualise my appearance and, rather than focus on the substance of a press conference, comment on my face or hair. Then there is cyberbullying, trolling and fake news. Opponents mount disinformation campaigns that are easily sexualised in the political context. I deal with it by choosing not to be a victim. I am not the sort of politician who is going to sing every day about how everything is so unfair. I focus on what I can control: my competence and my delivery. It takes time to gain public trust. But once people see you as a leader of integrity – that you are transparent, accountable and prepared to accept criticism with a measure of humility – they start to see beyond gender. One of the main things to increase women’s democratic participation is seeing other women in leadership – the role-model effect. Women comprise an embarrassingly low 14% of councillors in Zimbabwe. This lack of representation can lead to apathy, as women fail to see themselves represented. Having women stand as examples of public leadership and investing in the next generation of female leaders creates models in the public imagination and pushes more women to get involved. It builds courage. I remain optimistic about the future of Zimbabwe. Despite the present challenges of patriarchy, poverty and corruption, it is a country with all the ingredients necessary for success. But people, women especially, must register to vote. When the election comes in 2023, they must elect non-patriarchal women and men who will address the gender disparities in Zimbabwe’s political, social and economic realms. Apathy aids the patriarchal, anti-people status quo. Voting is the most powerful non-violent tool we have to bring an end to dictatorship and win change for Zimbabwe.

3/15/2022,"A court in India has ruled that wearing a hijab is not an essential principle of Islam, in a setback to Muslim students who were demanding the right to wear the headscarf in colleges in Karnataka, south India. The Karnataka high court was hearing the petitions of Muslim students who had been stopped in January from entering the government college in Udupi, where they were enrolled, for wearing the hijab. College principals said the hijab went against the rules that require a uniform to be worn. When the principals refused to relent, a group of students took the matter to court. Fearing unrest over the ruling, the state government, run by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), which also governs nationally, has banned large gatherings this week. The college authorities were backed by the state government which contended in court that the hijab was not an essential religious practice of Islam, and banning it in classrooms did not violate the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom. The students argued the opposite, namely, that the constitution guaranteed them the right to practise their faith and Islam required them to wear the hijab. Across the state, the controversy triggered protests and violence. In retaliation, rightwing Hindu groups demanded the right to wear saffron scarves in the classroom if the hijab was allowed – saffron is the colour of Hinduism and is associated with the BJP. Student activist Dhruv Jati welcomed the verdict, saying that no Muslim student had insisted earlier on wearing the hijab and accused Islamist activists of having a hand in the case. “But I do feel that to avoid poisoning the atmosphere in college, Muslim girls should get counselling so they can understand the reasons for the ruling and come to college,” Jati told NDTV news channel. Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, federal BJP minister for minorities, welcomed the ruling. “Muslim women can wear the hijab wherever they want – the market, the shop, the street, in private colleges – but government educational institutions have their own dress code and this must be followed,” he said. There has been no response yet from the Muslim students who took the matter to court. They are expected to appeal against it in the supreme court. The ruling is unlikely to douse the fiery debate that has been raging in India for weeks. Some fear that a ban on the hijab will force Muslim girls to stay at home and not seek an education. In a multi-religious society like India where people of each faith – such as Sikhs and their turbans and Hindus with their dab of vermilion on their foreheads wear symbols – they argue it is untenable to ban the hijab, particularly as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh is a monk who wears saffron robes. The fear among this group is that the BJP is trying again to impose its Hindu majority agenda on the minorities by depriving them of their right to religion and their freedom of choice.

3/15/2022,"Dune, the French Canadian director Denis Villeneuve’s long-gestating version of the 1965 novel by Frank Herbert, is a deeply weird blockbuster. I mean that as a compliment; Villeneuve’s adaptation of what many consider to be the paragon of futurist sci-fi stays true to the book’s disinterest in pandering, but turns what could be impossibly tricky, alienating material into world-building at its finest. The film is awash in strange, unnerving details – the black-oil baths and throat-singing on a rainy planet of mercenaries, human computers whose eyes roll back into their heads – whose utmost seriousness is compelling rather than off-putting. (Not that the Academy will account for this, but Dune is a great movie for memes.) In a gutsy move, Villeneuve chose to adapt just the novel’s first half before a second film was even greenlit, which results in a movie that defies the usual three-act structure and crashing resolution of the typical big-screen blockbuster. Instead, watching Dune is a submersion in several classic storylines – inheritance, political intrigue, resource wars, angsty coming of age – that slowly, richly unfurl in a society that actually feels alien. In other words, it’s a vibe, in the least flippant sense of the world. Villeneuve’s Dune is a masterful and strange piece of collaborative imagination, an epic that conveys scale in a way few massive films do, and a vision of a future society that conjures, disconcertingly and then thrillingly, the awe of encountering the otherworldly. That’s all the more impressive considering the source material; Herbert’s novel is dense, cerebral, unwelcoming to strangers and notoriously “unadaptable”. The book drops you into the geopolitical manoeuvrings of a feudal interplanetary society 20,000 years from now and expects you to keep up. (It has taken me four months and multiple viewings of the film to chip away at the first 250 pages.) Somehow said manoeuvrings are more vague than tedious, and the acting sharp enough to hold the emotional centre. Paul Atreides, a lonely aristocrat weighted with prophecy, who is somewhere between ages 15 and 24 depending on the scene, is the role Timotheé Chalamet was born to play. Rebecca Ferguson and Oscar Isaac are excellent as his beleaguered parents. Most importantly, Villeneuve’s ability to convey vast discrepancies of scale, as evinced by the skyscraper-tall oblong spaceships in his 2016 film Arrival, is repeatedly stunning, especially when viewed on a big screen – massive sandworms consuming waves of sand, imposing interplanetary aircraft carriers before a gargantuan planet, remote assassins the size of one’s palm. Dune is perhaps too arcane a film, too uninterested in nostalgia or timeliness, to register with Academy voters over, say, Belfast. There is also fair criticism of the film’s use of imagery and culture from the Middle East and north Africa (MENA) for the Fremen, the indigenous people of Dune (the planet), without using a MENA actor. (The plot of Dune does read, in 2022, as a barely disguised parable for oil in the Middle East.) But if the Oscars are, in theory, an occasion to reward excellence in the collaborative art of film-making and to celebrate the visual narrative heights such a medium can achieve, then there’s a case for Dune. All films are a feat of cooperation, some more than others, but Dune is a testament to scores and scores of people working at the highest level. Costume designers, set scouters, visual effects, stunt work, sound design – every level of film-making is on fine form in Dune. It’s unfortunately rare to watch a film and be struck by sound editing, but Dune’s sonic range, from terrific, heart-rewiring Hans Zimmer score to pinprick silence, was a catharsis all its own. More than any other film I’ve seen in the past year, Dune conjured a distinctive, mesmeric feel – a cinematic experience that provokes an earnest appreciation for simply living in an age where such scale is possible on screen. That’s not, I suppose, the earnestness the Academy usually goes for, but they could do worse than acknowledge the outer reaches of cinematic scale and ambition.",Arts/Film,Why Dune should win the best picture Oscar,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/15/why-dune-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar
3/15/2022,"Hello, this is Warren Murray with the stories you shouldn’t miss. Early this morning, explosions have been heard in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, with reports of residential apartment blocks on fire after a Russian missile strike. Russia and Ukraine are due to meet again for talks aimed at ending the 20-day war. In Russia, an editor on state-run Channel One TV has burst on to the set of the nightly news shouting “Stop the war, no to war”. Marina Ovsyannikova waved a sign saying: “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” It was signed “Russians against the war”. Ovsyannikova also released a video online saying she was ashamed at working for Channel One spreading “Kremlin propaganda … Ashamed that I allowed the zombification of the Russian people.” Ovsyannikova was reportedly arrested shortly after her protest and taken into police custody as a wave of praise and support for her actions spread online. She could face prison time under Russian legislation that criminalises speaking out about the invasion of Ukraine. Russia-Ukraine talks will continue today, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said overnight. One of his advisers has claimed the war will be over “by May” because Russia was running out of troops and resources to keep the invasion going. In an address, Zelenskiy called on Russian soldiers to surrender: “What are you dying for? … If you surrender to our forces we will treat you as humans have to be treated, with dignity.” China has already decided to provide Russia with economic and financial support during its war on Ukraine and is contemplating sending military supplies such as armed drones, US officials fear. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, has laid out the US case against Russia’s invasion in an “intense” seven-hour meeting in Rome with his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi. In its version of the discussions, China said Yang had urged all parties to exercise “maximum restraint” and protect civilians. The statement did not specifically refer to the claims of Russia asking Beijing for weapons. Keep up with Ukraine developments at our live blog. Trainee doctors shut out – Almost 800 medical graduates could be denied the chance to train as doctors this year, as they are told the NHS has no places for them despite crippling shortages of medics. Doctors are worried some of those denied a place will either go to work abroad instead or give up medicine altogether. The most recent official figures showed that the NHS in England is short of almost 8,200 doctors. The UK Foundation Programme (UKFPO), which ensures that aspirant doctors just graduated from medical school are able to start their training, has warned it is “over-subscribed” to a record level this year, with 8,209 places filled. The 791 who have missed out so far have been put on a reserve list. The UKFPO is telling graduates without a training place that they will get one somewhere in the UK by August. Covid travel curbs to end – All remaining Covid travel restrictions are to be dropped across the UK from later this week, despite a concerning rise in cases and hospitalisations. Ministers approved the scrapping of passenger locator forms and the requirement for all unvaccinated arrivals to get tested, with the changes to come into force from 4am on Friday. Quarantine hotels, which have not been used since the “red list” of countries was emptied in December but have been kept on standby, will also be fully stood down from the end of March. In the past week, 444,201 positive cases have been recorded – an increase of 48.1%. The number of patients admitted to hospital has also risen steeply to 10,576 in England as of 8am on 14 March – 19% up on the previous week. Trouble in train – There are warnings of a “spring of discontent” on the railways as unions and senior rail officials prepare for industrial action in response to curbs in government emergency funding that spell job cuts, pay freezes and closures. A deal for no compulsory redundancies and no walkouts lapsed at the end of 2021. Now, formal proposals for cuts are expected in the coming weeks. There is doubt over whether rail strikes still work for unions. Bringing London to a standstill for most of the working week would have been intolerable to many businesses before Covid; but with tube trains normally now only two-thirds full, the impact this month of London Underground strikes was muted. Many commuters were able to stay at home to work instead. Gwyn Topham, Guardian transport correspondent, explains further. Insecurity premium – Half of low-paid workers in the UK are given less than a week’s notice of their shifts, according to the Living Wage Foundation, highlighting an “insecurity premium” faced by employees on close to the minimum wage. It says almost half lose out on £30 or more a month because of last-minute changes, increasing their reliance on credit cards and borrowing to make ends meet. A separate study from the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank has found that while the national living wage has helped increase pay levels, results have been mixed: pay growth for the lowest-paid tenth of workers has been twice as fast compared with workers on average pay. Snacks pack in salt – Seven in 10 snacks sold as part of lunchtime meal deals in UK high street shops and supermarkets contain dangerously large amounts of salt, sugar or saturated fat, says Action on Salt. The worst offenders include biscuits, cakes and crisps, according to its research. For example, a packet of lemon and coriander green olives sold in the Co-op contained 2.02g of salt – a third of the adult daily maximum recommended by England’s health authorities. Denis Campbell’s story lists the saltiest snacks in the survey. Officially, it does not exist. But reporter Pjotr Sauer has traced the notorious Russian mercenary group’s activities in Syria and Africa – and recently spoke to one of its members.

Irish trainers are on course for another greenwash at this year’s Cheltenham Festival. Rachael Haynes held firm as a wobbly Australia claimed a seven-wicket Women’s World Cup win over the West Indies to stay unbeaten at the tournament in New Zealand. And Manchester United are considering all options with regard to updating Old Trafford, including knocking the stadium down and building a new one on the same site.

The Sun plays with fonts, printing “UKraine” with the UK part in union jack colours – “25,000 Brits offer to take in refugees” it adds. “Rush to take in Ukrainians” says the Times and it has a picture of the out-of-favour Roman Abramovich sitting in an airport lounge in Tel Aviv.
