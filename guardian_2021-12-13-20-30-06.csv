12/13/2021,"Even as the mob ran screaming and smashing through the capitol on January 6, it was clear this was a coup attempt. It was equally clear that it had been instigated by the then-president and his circle, much of whose audience in the “stop the steal” rally would become that mob. Everything since has been fill-in, important in building the legal case against the leaders of this attempted coup and establishing the facts for history and public knowledge – and, one hopes, for efforts to prevent another such attempt. That the goal was a coup is a solemnly horrifying fact. That those who orchestrated it and those who have excused and dismissed it afterward continue to conspire against the rule of law and the right of the people to choose their leaders is another such fact. Documents such as the Powerpoint presentation turned over to the January 6 Commission by Trump’s then-chief-of-staff Mark Meadows confirm the details and build our understanding of the threat. On the basis of sometimes ridiculous pretexts, the circle around then-President Trump intended to steal the election and seize power. Many, including Utah senator Mike Lee and South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, reportedly knew the agenda.  Had they succeeded in grabbing power with such an openly lawless act, they could have only kept it by suspending the rule of law. This is what a dictatorship is, and this is what they wanted: a government in which laws are nothing and the ruling junta or thug is everything. What the American people and foreign nations would have done in response might have overturned it further down the road, had it not failed that day, but the whole business is still terrifying, and the threat is not over. It was clear the military leadership was already alarmed: on January 3, all 10 living Secretaries of Defense coauthored an editorial declaring, “Efforts to involve the US armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory.” That few Republicans would defend the US constitution, the voice of the voters, and the orderly transition of power was also obvious. At 1:09pm that day, the Capitol Police Chief said he wanted to declare an emergency and call in the National Guard. At 1:11pm, Trump ended his speech with the words “If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore….” At 1:12pm, two of America’s slimiest elected officials, Congressman Paul Gosar and Senator Ted Cruz, were objecting to certifying Arizona’s electoral votes. Gosar, according to two participants in the riot, seemed to know what was coming and had promised “blanket pardons.” The evacuation of the House and Senate would begin an hour later. At 2:24, Trump tweeted, “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution…” Two conservative Republicans, Vice President Mike Pence, and Congresswoman Liz Cheney, have been among the few to refuse to participate in the coup, the big lie, and the surrounding corruption, and have paid for it. That terrible day, House Minority leader Kevin McCarthy reportedly called Trump to rage and curse at him and demand he call the mob off, but he would then fall in line and fudge the reality and significance of what happened that day. That day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell noted that to overturn the election results would send democracy into a “death spiral.” Afterward he was furious and shaken, but he too squirmed his way back into alignment with the big lie. By May he was trying to block the formation of the January 6 Commitee to investigate what had happened. The crisis isn’t just that we had a coup attempt almost a year ago, but that the Republican party has itself become so venal, so corrupt, so ruthless in its quest for power, that it seems assured that we will see further attempts to overrule any election outcomes they don’t like. Already the kind of election laws they’ve pushed across the country seem aimed at such goals, and voter suppression has long been one of their anti-democratic tactics (it played a substantial role in Trump’s 2016 win, and the genuine illegitimacies of that election – foreign interference, anomalies the recount might have uncovered had the Republicans not stopped it – were appropriated as false claims for 2020). The Republicans made a devil’s bargain decades ago, when they decided that they would not change course to win the votes of an increasingly nonwhite, increasingly progressive people, but would try to suppress those who would vote against them. That is, they pitted themselves against democracy as participatory government and free and fair elections. The rhetoric of the far right makes it clear they are fearful and know their power will ebb if they cannot command and subvert the laws and elections of this nation, and they are aiming at some form of minority rule. That’s perfectly clear from their attack on the Constitutional process unfolding that afternoon of January 6, which was itself a refusal to accept a loss. The refusal to recognize the authority of Congress by Trump associates, including Steve Bannon and Mark Meadows, is a further sign of their belief, emboldened by Trump’s four years of criming in public, that they make their own rules. The crisis isn’t just that we had a coup attempt and have a political party that has gone rogue, but that much of the rest of the nation seems to be normalizing or forgetting or sleepwalking through the crisis. The warnings are getting more urgent. “They’ve decided to burn it all down with us inside,“ said NBC anchor Brian Williams on Thursday, in his parting words as an NBC anchor. Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii stated Sunday, “The road to autocracy is paved with overly chill responses from people who would see this all with great clarity if only it were happening in a faraway place.” Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy declared, “This is nation-ending stuff we’re dealing with here and folks better wake up soon. I’ll do my part. Think about what yours is.” Rebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

12/13/2021,"Lateral flow home test kits are unavailable on the government website, as NHS England has advised people trying to book a Covid-19 booster jab to try later or tomorrow as extremely high demand overwhelmed the website. The government website on Monday said “there are no more home tests available” and advised people to “try again later” or to book a test site appointment instead. The surge in interest came after the prime minister, Boris Johnson, announced everyone over 18 in England “will have the chance to get their booster before the new year” in a dramatic acceleration of the vaccination campaign.  In a tweet, the health service said: “The Covid vaccine booking service is currently facing extremely high demand so is operating a queuing system. “For users aged 18-29, please be aware that booking opens on Wednesday 15 December. For all others experiencing waits, we would advise trying again later today or tomorrow.” The COVID vaccine booking service is currently facing extremely high demand so is operating a queueing system.For users aged 18-29, please be aware that booking opens on Wednesday 15 Dec.For all others experiencing waits, we would advise trying again later today or tomorrow. It comes on the first day that 30- to 39-year-olds in England can officially book the jab. The service had already booked more than 140,000 vaccine appointments on Monday, NHS Digital said, with people waiting several minutes. Although the booking system does not open for those under 30 until Wednesday, Johnson said on Sunday night some would be able to use walk-in centres as early as Monday. There are also shortages of rapid lateral flow tests to be used in the home, with users of the NHS booking website told: “Sorry, there are no more home test kits available right now. Try again later.” The shortage comes after health officials announced over the weekend that double-jabbed people identified as a contact of someone with Covid-19 in England would be told to take a daily rapid test for seven days from Tuesday. On Monday, Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents the healthcare system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the booster goals were “ambitious”. “The health service was already under unprecedented pressure, and this is going to mean that other important parts of the NHS’s work are going to have to be put on the back burner in order to be able to deliver this,” he said. “It’s really important the government is clear with the public about the consequences this is going to have for what the rest of the health service is going to offer.”",News/World news,"No more lateral flow home test kits available, says NHS England",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/no-more-home-covid-tests-available-says-nhs-england
12/13/2021,"Scotland’s health secretary, Humza Yousaf, has said it will be “extremely challenging” to hit the new Covid booster target and confirmed there would be new controls to stem the spread of the Omicron variant. Yousaf said the health service would need to draft in medical students, army personnel and private contractors, and switch NHS staff from normal duties, to have a chance of hitting the new target of boosting all eligible adults by the end of January. He said some non-essential operations may need to be postponed.  “It will be extremely challenging and that’s why we’re going to have to strain every sinew we can [and] that includes potentially having to move NHS staff away from other core duties to do this,” he told BBC Radio Scotland. In her statement on Sunday evening confirming the Scottish government supported the revised booster target date, Nicola Sturgeon hinted that it could be hard to achieve. Describing the new date as “the aim”, the first minister said it would be met “if possible”. Yousaf said it was “inevitable” the first minister would announce fresh restrictions to combat the rapid surge in Omicron infections in an update to the Scottish parliament on Tuesday, after briefing her cabinet that morning. He would not speculate on what that would involve. He confirmed that closing schools early for the Christmas holidays – a proposal being pushed by the EIS, Scotland’s largest teachers’ union, was being considered but he said that was a measure of last resort. The first minister had made clear last week she wanted to avoid disrupting schools, partly to support children’s mental health. “We will do everything we possibly can to keep schools open during this period,” Yousaf said. Although Scotland already has the highest booster vaccinations figure of any UK government, the health secretary added, hitting the target date would mean nearly doubling the daily rate. As things stand, he said, there were not enough qualified vaccinators to do so. There are already long queues and delays at many vaccination centres, and some walk-in clinics are running out of doses. Last week, Yousaf had warned it would be very difficult to meet the original booster target date of 31 January, and ministers in Edinburgh had been pressing the Ministry of Defence to release more army personnel to help. “To ramp up even more from where we are at the moment would require us to go from 40,000 third doses and boosters in a day to somewhere like 70,000. That’s a huge increase that we have to try to get to,” he said on Monday.",News/UK news,"Hitting Covid booster target ‘challenging’, says Scottish health secretary",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/13/hitting-covid-booster-target-challenging-says-scottish-health-secretary
12/13/2021,"The sawdust on the floor, the not-unpleasant smell of fat, the hooks and flesh against the white tiles: I remember these things about Harbours Butchers on Southdown Road, Harpenden. Also, the glass booth across from the counter where Mrs Harbour sat and took money and dispensed receipts, a scene recreated back home when I forced my younger brother and sister to be customers. Maybe more than any other shop, I recall the chatter at Harbours, how talk and advice were passed back and forth across the counter like the parcels of lamb chops and bacon. There was even more chatter 180 and 250 miles farther north, in Oldham and Stokesley, at the butchers frequented by my granny and grandma respectively. It was with them I learned what a good combination small talk, health updates and the price of four ounces of liver makes, and that, if you do eat meat, how rewarding a relationship with a good butcher can be. Both Alice and Phyllis, also my aunty May, who loved a cow heel, would have liked Testaccio market. It has five butchers’ stalls, all of which have a direct (or indirect) line back to the slaughterhouse, which may have closed in the 1970s, repurposed for other functions, but is still an imposing presence just metres from the new market. If I could, I would take all three of them to Cesare, who runs one stall with his wife, Delia, the smallest of the five, but maybe the most enmeshed with the quarter since 1918. He may have left his memorabilia behind when the market moved a few years ago, but I still know Cesare is a devoted Beatles fan. And this knowledge is nice; in my head, it hangs around our every interaction, as he carefully squashes two sausages into the twice-minced beef for meatballs, cuts a fold of tripe or bones a whole chicken.  I first made this dish for Christmas 10 years ago, when I was given half a boned turkey and the advice to stuff it, which I did hastily, and then managed to overcook it. Cooking disappointments, I find, are like fairground games, and have two results: banishment (never doing/making that again) or determination (until I get it right, which I think I have). Ask a butcher or capable person to bone the chicken. The recipe can be adapted for breasts, skin on and split, stuffed and tied. Or the stuffing can simply be used with a whole chicken, either stuffed inside or baked and served on the side. I recommend the boned version, though: it is celebratory and rewarding, everything bundled neatly, the juices and generous chestnut-prune-apple stuffing keeping everything tender, slicing neatly. Serves 4-6 1 chicken approx 1.7kg, boned1 small onion, peeled and diced1 knob of butter, plus extra for smearing2 tbsp olive oil100g peeled cooked chestnuts, chopped50g soft prunes, chopped50g apple, peeled and diced1 sprig fresh thyme, minced3 sage leaves, mincedA pinch of dried oreganoSalt and black pepper100ml white wine Lay out the chicken breast side down and season. Get some string ready and heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4.Fry the onion in the butter and olive oil until it turns soft and translucent. Add the chestnuts, prunes, apples, herbs, a pinch of salt and plenty of black pepper, and cook for a few minutes more. Take off the heat and leave to cool for a couple of minutes. Arrange the stuffing in a heap down the centre of the open chicken, then bring the sides and legs up and in to form a parcel (the skin can be helpful here). Using either a single piece of string or several lengths, tie the chicken into a bundle. Rub the skin all over with olive oil, season and put the chicken breast side up in roasting tray or dish that’s just a bit larger than the bird itself. Roast for an hour, pouring the wine into the bottom of the dish after 30 minutes. Test by inserting a skewer into the middle of the meat: if the juices run clear, it’s ready; if not, return to the oven for five minutes and test again. Cover loosely with foil, rest for 15 minutes, then carve into thick slices and serve with a spoonful of the cooking juices.

12/13/2021,"Coronavirus has hit the UK hard, with the country recording more than 10m cases and 140,000 deaths linked to the disease. The government figures below include confirmed cases only – some people who have the disease are not tested.  At the start of the pandemic, London bore the brunt of coronavirus’s impact. After that, the centre of the virus shifted northwards and to areas in Northern Ireland before rising again in London and the south-east. Hotspots have now developed again across the country. Everyday life in the UK has been subject to varying degrees of restriction since March 2020, although national restrictions were relaxed in all four nations of the UK over the summer of 2021. Details of the English guidance are listed here, Scottish guidance here, Welsh guidance here and Northern Irish here. Cases in the UK first peaked in early April 2020, before falling in late spring and summer. Numbers started to increase again that autumn, reaching a record level in January 2021. Cases then declined sharply but have increased again since the latest lockdown release. They now remain at a high but relatively stable level. The number of tests available affects the number of recorded cases. The number of people in hospital with coronavirus rose sharply after records started at the end of March 2020, peaking in April. That figure began rising again in September and reached a new record in January 2021. It is now at a relatively low level but is increasing steadily as we go into winter 2021-22. Deaths surpassed their first-wave peak in January 2021, with daily deaths once again standing at over 1,000. As with hospitalisations, the number of deaths is now at a relatively low level, although there has been an uptick over the autumn. Since mid-May 2021, cases have shot up at a rate comparable to the start of the second wave in autumn 2020. However, hospitalisations and deaths remain much lower than at the equivalent time during the second wave. Scientists say this is at least partly down to the protective effects of vaccines. Since UK regulators approved the Pfizer vaccine in December 2020, the UK’s vaccine rollout has picked up pace. Until early July, hundreds of thousands of people were being vaccinated every day, although this then slowed down. The introduction of the booster campaign in October 2021 increased vaccine rollout once again. With first-dose vaccines open to over-12s in the UK from 20 October 2021, vaccines are available to everyone except younger children. However, in all age groups there is a persistent number of people who are not vaccinated. The lowest rates of vaccination are among younger age groups. While they were the last to be invited for vaccinations, there are concerns about vaccine hesitancy among younger people. By looking at vaccine take-up in the days since it became available to each age cohort, we can see that for younger age groups, take-up tends to be slower. Lockdown had brought down case rates for everyone. But different age groups have been affected differently. Throughout the pandemic working-age people between 20 and 60 have had the highest levels of infection. This has become more stark since the vaccine rollout has protected many of the more vulnerable elderly people in society, with case rates rising among the younger groups while staying relatively low among older people. In the table below, you can find out the number of cases per 100,000 in your area, both for the last week and since the start of the pandemic. This data comes comes from Public Health England, working with devolved authorities in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Differences in data collection and publishing schedules may lead to temporary inconsistencies. The government figures for deaths that are used in this tracker incorporate any deaths that have occurred within 28 days of a positive test. This means they are able to quickly capture deaths occurring in hospitals and care homes, both settings where testing is widespread. The ONS, along with its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland, captures deaths data differently. They count all deaths where Covid is on the death certificate. About 90% of these deaths are directly due to Covid while it is a contributory factor in the remaining deaths.

12/13/2021,"Good morning. Joe Biden declared a major federal disaster in Kentucky after a swarm of deadly tornadoes hit the state on Friday, as representatives of a candle factory destroyed by a twister said far fewer people may have died than previously feared.  The president had previously declared the storms a federal emergency, and the move to designate the storms a federal disaster paves the way for additional aid, as thousands face housing, food, water and power shortages. It follows a formal request from the Kentucky governor, Andy Beshear, who said the tornadoes were the most destructive in the state’s history. He initially said more than 100 people could have died. But yesterday afternoon he said the death toll could be as low as 50, according to the Associated Press. Isn’t spring the main season for tornadoes? Yes, this latest event was very unusual coming in December, when colder weather normally limits tornadoes, said Victor Gensini, an extreme weather researcher. Does the climate emergency have something to do with this? Possibly. Biden has asked the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate what role the crisis might have played. The US government’s leading infectious diseases official, Dr Anthony Fauci, has called for Americans to get a Covid-19 booster shot, as the US approaches 800,000 lives lost to coronavirus since the start of the pandemic. Fauci warned the Omicron variant appeared to be able to “evade” the protection of two initial doses of the mRNA-type Covid vaccines – Pfizer/BioNTech’s and Moderna’s – as well as post-infection therapies such as monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma. Omicron is spurring new fears as US infections begin to surge again, with infections currently still led by the highly-transmissible Delta variant that has dominated since the summer. Fauci said an extra vaccine shot provided “optimal” protection against Omicron. What makes boosters more effective than the first two Covid jabs? Mutations in the virus look quite different from that of the original Wuhan strain that all current vaccines were designed to target. That in turn means existing antibodies will be less efficient at intercepting Omicron and a higher quantity of antibodies is required to compensate for them being less well matched. The Oscar-nominated actor Naomie Harris has said a #MeToo incident on one of her recent projects prompted the “immediate” removal of the perpetrator, as she recalled another occasion when she was groped by a “huge star” who faced no censure. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, Harris, who played Moneypenny in the last three Bond films and was up for an Oscar for her role in Moonlight in 2017, recalled an incident she had previously discussed in which “a huge, huge star” put his hand up her skirt during an audition. “What was so shocking about it was the casting director was there and the director, and of course no one said anything because he was – he is – such a huge star. That was my only #MeToo incident, so I felt very lucky given how rife that behaviour was. “Now things have definitely changed: I was on a project where there was a #MeToo incident and there was no hesitation – [the perpetrator] was immediately removed,” she said. Who were the perpetrators? Harris declined to name either of the men allegedly responsible. Almost 80 pages of investigative reports obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle lay out the tragic missteps that led to the death of Ellen Chung, Jonathan Gerrish and their one-year-old daughter, Miju, in August and hold important lessons about the dangers of hiking in a grueling climate. South and North Korea, China and the US have agreed “in principle” to declare a formal end to the Korean war, almost 70 years after the conflict ended in a shaky truce, the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, has said. But he added that North Korea had made an end to US hostility a precondition for talks. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said the collapse of the Soviet Union spelled the end of “historical Russia”, revealing that he drove a taxi to make ends meet after the fall of the USSR. He said it was “unpleasant to talk about” his cab work in that period as he lamented Soviet Union’s demise. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, health and economic disparities are still seriously affecting Indigenous communities, the president of one of the largest Native American–run non-profits has said, despite some progress achieved by the Biden administration. Millions of Americans are working into their senior years because they cannot afford not to have a job. Over the next decade, the number of workers aged 75 and older is expected to increase in the US by 96.5%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, with their labor force participation rate projected to rise from 8.9% in 2020 to 11.7% by 2030. “At 75 years old, I’m forced to still have to work to try to make ends meet,” Maria Rios, a food prep worker told the Guardian. In 2018, Dr Rebecca Gomperts founded Aid Access, a site that allows women in the US to get abortions with the help of 10 US-based providers. Founded especially to help American women – and to evade legal challenges in the US – Aid Access is one of the most affordable ways to get a safe abortion in America. “They only charge $150,” Gomperts says. The website says the organisation tries to help women who cannot pay, too. But she has been helping those facing restrictive legal regimes get safe abortions since long before the advent of Aid Access. On 9 October 2020, Rachel Bellesen started the day thinking she was the victim. After all, she had already explained how her ex-partner attacked her. How he tried to rape her. How she shot and killed him in self-defense. But throughout the night, Bellesen noticed she hadn’t been treated the way a crime victim should. It didn’t occur to her until now that the justice system saw her as a perpetrator – as a killer. Not after everything she had survived at the hands of Jacob Glace. “I felt like I was dead inside,” Bellesen says, looking back. The Biden administration admitted a court decision did not compel it to lease vast tracts of the Gulf of Mexico for oil and gas drilling, shortly before claiming it was legally obliged to do so when announcing the sell-off, the Guardian can reveal. Last month, the US government offered more than 80m acres of the gulf’s seabed for fossil fuel extraction. The enormous sale, which took place just four days after the Cop26 UN climate talks in Scotland, was denounced by outraged environmental groups as a “huge carbon bomb”. In May, the Guardian spoke to Demi Skipper after she’d traded three tractors for one of only a few Chipotle celebrity cards in the world, worth about $20,000. She had been inspired by Kyle MacDonald, who in 2006 traded a red paperclip all the way to a house, and wanted to reach her goal by summer’s end. Only a few months later than hoped, Skipper, 29, has been handed the keys to a little house near Nashville, Tennessee. No mortgage. No fees. And not a penny spent (except on shipping).",News/US news,Biden declares federal disaster after Kentucky tornadoes | First Thing,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/13/first-thing-biden-declares-federal-disaster-after-kentucky-tornadoes

12/13/2021,"In the final race of the most dramatic Formula One season ever, Lewis Hamilton failed in his bid to become a record eight-time world champion. Cruising to victory with just five laps left, a crash, and an outrageous decision by the race stewards, led to his chief rival, Max Verstappen – on fresh tyres – overtaking him on the final lap. Yet in “losing”, Hamilton has proven himself a true champion. This year he became the first Formula One driver to win 100 races. He was a key protagonist of the greatest season the sport has ever known. And, though he remains on seven world titles, no other driver has won more.  But almost more important than all of that is the fact that, in the past 18 months, he has grown into someone who is not just a fantastically successful racing driver, but who has transcended sport and become a major global cultural figure. The change in Hamilton has been profound. Until May last year he was known beyond racing mainly as someone who promoted his own fashion wear and who hung around with other celebrities. But the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, and the global anti-racism movement it sparked, awakened his sense of social justice. As Hamilton told the Guardian: “I was in tears. And this stuff came up that I’d suppressed over all these years. And it was so powerful and sad and also releasing. And I thought, ‘I can’t stay quiet’… And so when I did speak out, that was me letting the Black community know, ‘I hear you and I stand with you.’” He’d once, 10 years ago, made a semi-joking reference to the often harsh way Formula One stewards treated him, saying: “Maybe it’s because I’m Black” – after which he quickly apologised and remained largely silent on race issues. This wasn’t surprising because, as the only Black driver in the history of the sport, and with only a handful of Black faces among the thousands who work for the teams and the Formula One management, he’d have known few people would back him up. But when the Covid-delayed 2020 season began in Austria just over a month after Floyd’s death, Hamilton took the knee before the race, donning a Black Lives Matter T-shirt, and persuaded the other drivers to wear End Racism T-shirts alongside him – 13 taking the knee, six standing. This pre-race protest has continued into the current season. At one race last year, Hamilton – referring to another Black death at the hands of US police – wore a T-shirt reading: “Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor.” After this, the sport’s organisers introduced new rules banning “political or religious” messaging on clothing worn post-race. Hamilton didn’t only take a symbolic stance: he funded an investigation into the lack of diversity within motorsport, bringing together senior Formula One figures, engineering institutions, MPs and equality campaigners. The subsequent report was published in July and called for change, and action, in all aspects of the sport and in the fields of science and engineering. Beyond that, Hamilton has spoken out against human rights abuses in the nations that have hosted grands prix. Before the race in Hungary he posted on Instagram: “I want to share my support for those affected by the government’s anti-LGBTQ+ law.” He raced in a rainbow-coloured helmet at the last three grands prix – in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi – in solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community. Though Hamilton faced a media storm this month when it emerged that his Formula One team, Mercedes, had accepted sponsorship from a company that had manufactured some of the combustible insulation used on Grenfell Tower, this was a decision of his team owners in which he played no part. Within days, the deal was terminated. Beyond his political words and actions, in this season in particular Hamilton has connected at a personal level with many who have watched the unfolding drama. Quite simply, it has been a story in black and white. This year, in cars of equal quality, Hamilton faced a young opponent who has been continuously willing to bend the rules to breaking point in order to win. If there’s one theme that runs through the season it’s of Verstappen seemingly being prepared to risk a crash to stop Hamilton overtaking him. In San Marino, Spain, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and on Sunday in Abu Dhabi, Hamilton had to take avoiding action to prevent a collision – though it was only in Saudi Arabia that Verstappen was penalised. How, many ask, would a Black person be treated if they drove the same way as Verstappen? It’s a situation many Black people can identify with in their own working lives: where the bad behaviour of a white colleague is excused or, worse, seen as a sign of their genius. Verstappen, who went way off track in Brazil to prevent a Hamilton overtake, received no punishment, to the astonishment of many fellow drivers. And even when he has been penalised, the bad behaviour has continued. On the podium after the Saudi race a week ago, where his driving was penalised and criticised by many for being aggressive, Verstappen stormed off before the traditional celebrations began. Contrast that with Hamilton’s grace and dignity on Sunday, where he praised Verstappen for his championship win despite the huge controversy. Few could imagine Verstappen doing the same if the title had been wrenched from him in similar circumstances. It’s behaviour Hamilton has witnessed before. Two years ago his then main rival, Sebastian Vettel, smarting after a penalty denied him victory, swapped round the “first” and “second” placards in front of the drivers’ cars in the paddock. Could Hamilton have ever behaved like this without sparking a huge outcry and incurring the wrath of the authorities? That’s why Hamilton’s experiences, despite being at such an elite level, connect so much with Black people. We can’t lose our temper; we can’t raise our voices; we can’t walk out in a strop. All we can do is make our talent do the talking, and hope it’s enough. For Hamilton, in a sport where ability is clearly measurable, that has worked. And after a weekend of barely believable bad fortune, followed by a hugely contentious decision, he’s proved himself to be a true champion.

12/13/2021,"Malta will this week become the first European country to legalise the cultivation and possession of cannabis for personal use, pipping Luxembourg to the post, as the continent undergoes a wave of change to its drug laws. Possession of up to seven grams of the drug will be legal for those aged 18 and above, and it will permissible to grow up to four cannabis plants at home, with up to 50g of the dried leaves storable.  A vote in favour of the legislation in the Maltese parliament on Tuesday will be followed by the law being signed by the president in order for it to be enacted by the weekend, Owen Bonnici, the minister responsible, told the Guardian. The move by Malta, the EU’s smallest member state, is likely to be followed by reform across Europe in 2022. Germany recently announced a move to establish a legally regulated market, following announcements from the governments of Switzerland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. A referendum in Italy is planned, while Canada, Mexico and 18 US states have already enacted similar legislation. Boris Johnson’s UK government has, in contrast, been accused of taking a Richard Nixon-style “war on drugs” approach after maintaining its tough approach to cannabis use and making criminal sanctions for the users of class A narcotics a central plank of its recently published 10-year strategy. Bonnici said his government did not want to encourage the use of recreational drugs but that there was no evidence for the argument that the use of cannabis was in itself a gateway to harder substances. He said: “There is a wave of understanding now that the hard-fist approach against cannabis users was disproportionate, unjust and it was rendering a lot of suffering to people who are leading exemplary lives. But the fact that they make use on a personal basis of cannabis is putting them in the jaws of criminality. He added: “I’m very glad that Malta will be the first country which will put words in statute in a comprehensive manner with a regulatory authority”. The change in approach by a number of European governments follows a decision by the UN last December to remove cannabis from a listing of drugs designated as potentially addictive and dangerous, and having little or no therapeutic use. The Maltese approach seeks to avoid criminalising any cannabis use while regulating to ensure harm reduction, Bonnici said. Possession of up to 28 grams will lead to a fine of €50-€100 but with no criminal record. Those under the age of 18 who are found in possession will go before a commission for justice for the recommendation of a care plan rather than face arrest. Those who consume cannabis in front of a child face fines of between €300 and €500. Beyond allowing people to grow plants at home, albeit out of sight of the public, it will be legal for non-profit cannabis clubs to cultivate the drug for distribution among their members, similar to organisations tolerated in Spain and the Netherlands. Club membership will be limited to 500 people and only up to 7 grams a day may be distributed to each person, with a maximum of 50 grams a month. The organisations, which cannot be situated less than 250 metres from a school, a club or a youth centre, may also distribute up to 20 seeds of the plant cannabis to each member every month. Bonnici said his government had conducted a long debate over whether to put in controls on the strength of cannabis that can be grown and used, measured by the level of the key psychoactive, or mood-altering, ingredient, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (TCH). He said: “We had a huge discussion internally on that. And we concluded that if a limit [can be put] on the strength of the cannabis, the THC levels, you will be creating a new market for the black market. What we need to do is to educate people and inform them day after day.” The Netherlands is possibly the European country most associated with a relaxed attitude toward the use of cannabis. However, recreational use, possession and trade is technically illegal there. The government instead has a gedoogbeleid, a “tolerance policy”, under which use is largely accepted within bounds. A trial is planned under which the production of the drug will be regulated.",News/Society,Malta to legalise cannabis for personal use in European first,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/13/malta-to-be-first-in-europe-to-legalise-cannabis-for-personal-use
12/13/2021,"Online estate agency Purplebricks will be forced to set aside as much as £9m after it found that its lettings business had failed to follow law protecting tenants’ deposits. The company on Monday said it would delay publication of its results for the six months to 31 October, which were due on Tuesday, in order to work out how much the error would cost.  Purplebricks’s share price slumped by 20% on Monday morning to reach a new all-time low of 25p after it revealed the error. The company described the problem as a “process issue in how it has been communicating with tenants on behalf of its landlords in relation to deposit registrations”, in a statement to the stock market. Purplebricks, which is listed on London’s Alternative Investment Market, on Monday said it needed to cover “potential future claims which could arise under the Housing Act in relation to this regulatory process issue”. Under the Housing Act, landlords have 30 days to inform their tenants of details of how their deposits are protected under government-backed schemes. If the landlord has not protected a deposit, a court can order the landlord to pay tenants up to three times the original amount. The deposit protection schemes were brought in by the government in 2007 to prevent unscrupulous landlords from keeping tenants’ deposits, which are often worth a month’s rent or more. The error is the latest blow to Purplebricks, which has struggled to live up to its promise as a UK tech company that was worth as much as £1.4bn in 2017 before its international expansion foundered. On Monday its market value fell below £80m. Purplebricks made revenues of £91m in the year to the end of April, but a £9m hit would have wiped out operating profits of £8.2m. The company last month warned that profits would be lower than expected as the supply of homes on the market failed to match the demand for more space prompted by the pandemic. The profit warning sent shares down by more than a third. It faces legal action from 100 estate agents who argue that they were in effect employed by the company so should be entitled to holiday pay and pension contributions.",News/Business,Purplebricks to set aside up to £9m to cover lettings errors,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/13/purplebricks-to-set-aside-up-to-9m-to-cover-lettings-errors
